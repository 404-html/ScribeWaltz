1
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,880
Can you guys hear me? We're
on rock and roll. Hi Guys.

2
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:18,020
Welcome. Awesome. So as you can see,

3
00:00:18,021 --> 00:00:21,530
we're here to talk about human
connection in the digital age. Uh,

4
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,410
thank you guys for taking
the time to be here. Um,

5
00:00:24,411 --> 00:00:27,530
so I want to start by thanking you
all because, uh, being at Google,

6
00:00:27,531 --> 00:00:32,420
I know that you could be getting
a massage for free lunch for free,

7
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:37,490
haircut, for free, a lot of other
things, but you're here with me and uh,

8
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,780
that makes me happy.

9
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,380
And so what I want to promise you before
we dig in today is that we're not just

10
00:00:42,381 --> 00:00:44,590
going to talk about human connection.
Uh,

11
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,930
we're actually gonna talk about
how to connect in a digital age.

12
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:51,230
And so my goal is that you guys walk out
of here with tangible techniques that

13
00:00:51,231 --> 00:00:55,820
you can use to connect with the people
you want and the people that you want to

14
00:00:55,821 --> 00:01:00,640
know. How's that sound? Rock
and roll. So you guys void.

15
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:04,130
Again, this talk is going to be broken
up into three specific sections.

16
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,880
So stories about how was able to take
this deep yearning for connections,

17
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,590
curiosity about relationships.

18
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,550
Turn it into this business that has helped
100,000 people to give what we think

19
00:01:13,551 --> 00:01:15,440
is the most meaningful gift in the world.

20
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,370
We're going to talk about stats had a
strong social ties and relationships

21
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:21,560
affect our brains and affect our bodies.

22
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,440
And we're going to talk
about tangible takeaways.

23
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,200
So how we can actually
communicate to connect.

24
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,870
So there's those three
components and before we start,

25
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:33,350
it's always nice to actually
establish what is human connection.

26
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,220
And my favorite definition
is this one by Bernay Brown.

27
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:43,070
I define connection is energy that exists
between people when they feel seen and

28
00:01:43,071 --> 00:01:47,570
heard and valued, and when they can
give and receive without judgement.

29
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,770
And when they derive strength and
sustenance from the relationship,

30
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:56,810
a beautiful articulation of that
energy that exists between two people.

31
00:01:56,811 --> 00:01:59,330
When we feel connected and at tribute,

32
00:01:59,331 --> 00:02:01,520
we've actually broken
dot down even further.

33
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:06,020
So we've created a construct that can
allow people to evaluate the depth of

34
00:02:06,021 --> 00:02:09,470
their relationships, that which they
have an abundance of. That's what's that,

35
00:02:09,471 --> 00:02:12,470
which they're really seeking.
And we call that Avs.

36
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:17,090
So avs is a mutual
feeling of a appreciation,

37
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:22,730
mutual recognition of the other person.
Do you see that person?

38
00:02:22,731 --> 00:02:26,480
Do you appreciate who they are?
Needs to exist for human connection?

39
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,630
Second,
vulnerability.

40
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:35,990
Can I be honest with this person?
Can I be truthful with this person?

41
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,140
Can I be fully myself with this person?

42
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,230
Vulnerability is the bridge to connection.

43
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:48,370
Next is support and support's a beautiful
thing and the way you think about it

44
00:02:48,371 --> 00:02:53,080
in human connection as a natural
call to support and be supported.

45
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,550
And so these are the three components
that we can break down when human

46
00:02:57,551 --> 00:03:02,170
connection truly exists and easy way
to evaluate your friendships as well as

47
00:03:02,171 --> 00:03:04,750
those new relationships
that you're adding depth to.

48
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,670
That's our definition of human connection.

49
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,960
So we all know that human connection is
important to experience, to have fun,

50
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:12,130
to magnify joy.

51
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:16,030
But I also want to introduce you to why
we should really care about our social

52
00:03:16,031 --> 00:03:18,180
ties are relationships.
And to do that,

53
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,070
I'm going to introduce you to a
guy named doctor Robert Waldinger.

54
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:26,610
So doctor Waldinger did the longest
study on happiness in our history as a 75

55
00:03:27,131 --> 00:03:30,160
year longitudinal study of 750 people.

56
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,640
When they released this research,
he gave this famous Ted talk.

57
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,610
And also as I was perusing through
the results of that research,

58
00:03:36,611 --> 00:03:40,900
there was one statement that
they literally highlighted
and bolded to emphasize

59
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:43,240
its importance.
And that statement was this.

60
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:48,340
The clearest message we got from this
study is that good relationships keep us

61
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:50,980
happier and healthier,
period.

62
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:55,990
Good relationships keep us
happier and healthier period.

63
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:58,510
So from this research,

64
00:03:58,511 --> 00:04:02,770
we can assume that strong social ties
investing in our relationships is probably

65
00:04:02,771 --> 00:04:05,320
the smartest investment we can
make in our overall happiness.

66
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:09,160
But it goes beyond just happiness. What
about our health? What about our brains?

67
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:10,300
What about our bodies?

68
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:15,430
So recent research also shows
people who have strong social ties.

69
00:04:15,431 --> 00:04:19,660
The medical term to connotate
relationships have longer lives,

70
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,340
stronger immune systems,

71
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:24,820
literally higher levels of white
blood cells to fight off disease,

72
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,220
lower levels of stress and anxiety,

73
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:32,340
and they're less likely to dive into
bad habits like smoking or drinking and

74
00:04:32,681 --> 00:04:35,440
alarming study.
I recently ran into said this,

75
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:41,340
having weak social ties is as harmful
to ongoing health as being an alcoholic

76
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:46,870
and twice as harmful as obesity.
So again,

77
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:51,010
when we have weak social ties, it's
not just a detriment to our happiness.

78
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,700
It's a detriment to our health
and our mental wellbeing.

79
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,640
So it's something that
we need to care about.

80
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,690
And so now I want to tell you guys a
little bit about how I got into this line

81
00:05:01,691 --> 00:05:04,120
of work,
how I was able to study human connection,

82
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,570
start businesses that are bolstering
relationship and gratitude in the world.

83
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,310
And it started when I was 10 years old.

84
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:13,440
The first job I can remember is selling
these books in the back of a room from

85
00:05:13,441 --> 00:05:17,470
my mom. My Mom's an eight time published
author. She talks about communication,

86
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:20,290
networking,
articulating the value of your ideas.

87
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,770
So this thread of communicating to connect
with something that was ingrained in

88
00:05:23,771 --> 00:05:25,930
me at a very young age.

89
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:30,400
And so one of the common threads
through my childhood was sports.

90
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,540
It was how I connected playing
basketball, football, and Lacrosse.

91
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:39,610
Right before I graduated,
I was enlightened to the
power of adaptive athletics,

92
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:44,080
helping young people with disabilities
to unite with their peers through sports.

93
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,470
And that inspired me to
start dreams for kids, DC,

94
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,550
a community that brought kids together
to play all these incredible things you

95
00:05:49,551 --> 00:05:53,650
see up here. Waterskiing outdoor
adventures, hockey, Lacrosse,

96
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,950
using sport as a facilitator
of human connection.

97
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,410
Then I got really interested in tech
and I started to look at bigger problems

98
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:03,350
affecting the dip, the people with
disabilities in their community.

99
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,360
And so we've built ability list,

100
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,680
an online platform that allows people
with disabilities to share the resources

101
00:06:09,681 --> 00:06:13,280
they know, they know about
and that they need. So again,

102
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,190
building community with
an online platform.

103
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,740
So this passion for connection,

104
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,480
this curiosity about communication took
a step up to the next level when I was

105
00:06:23,481 --> 00:06:27,350
27 years old and it all
started with a gift.

106
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,680
So my fiance Mickey is in the
back of the room right now. Um,

107
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,990
and on my 27th birthday she took me out
to dinner and Brooklyn where we live. Uh,

108
00:06:35,991 --> 00:06:38,830
we come back to our apartment and always
remember that I swing the door open

109
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,340
thinking that we're going
to have a low key night.

110
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:45,500
And then there's a silence
and then three, two, one,

111
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:50,860
all these people jump out. She had
planned this incredible surprise parties.

112
00:06:50,861 --> 00:06:53,300
So I'm hanging out with all of our
favorite people in the apartment.

113
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:58,040
Halfway through the Party,
Mickey jumps up on a chair and she yells,

114
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,420
everyone in the living row.
So everyone runs into the living room.

115
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:06,470
She sits me right in the back and she
had rented this projection screen so she

116
00:07:06,471 --> 00:07:11,240
puts it up on the wall. I have no idea
what's going on and I would soon find out.

117
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:16,430
So Mickey had taken the time to reach out
to 25 of my closest friends and all my

118
00:07:16,431 --> 00:07:17,300
family members.

119
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:21,320
She asked each one of them to submit
a one minute video telling me why they

120
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:25,790
loved me. Even telling you this, I
get goosebumps over my entire body.

121
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,190
So as I sat there in the back of the room,

122
00:07:28,191 --> 00:07:32,030
these videos started to stream my best
friend in New York calling me his best

123
00:07:32,031 --> 00:07:33,260
friend.
For the first time ever,

124
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,310
my brother telling me how grateful he
is that we're finally friends again.

125
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,070
My mom telling me how proud of me she is.

126
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:44,360
And that was about the moment that what
Alan Watts would call tears of wonder.

127
00:07:44,361 --> 00:07:48,170
Joy started to flow.
Not even a cute little cry,

128
00:07:48,171 --> 00:07:52,880
but like a big ugly, like massive
drops coming down. One of those cries.

129
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:57,230
And I did that for the next 20 minutes
straight because I remember when it

130
00:07:57,231 --> 00:07:59,930
stopped, the first thought
I had in my head was, wow,

131
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:03,350
I just watched my eulogy at 27,

132
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:08,200
which is a much better time to
watch her eulogy in my opinion. Um,

133
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:11,780
so I needed a break and I walked over
to the next room and I just looked at

134
00:08:11,781 --> 00:08:15,560
Mickey and I said, that was the best
gift I've ever received. And I said,

135
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:20,180
how'd you do it? And She just looks back
at me and she says, well, it was terrible.

136
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:23,990
And so she says,
again,

137
00:08:23,991 --> 00:08:26,690
it was hundreds of emails to remind
people to submit their videos,

138
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:30,770
collecting files through Dropbox, drive,
text message. And last but not least,

139
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:33,410
editing everything together.
And I movie.

140
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:36,260
So it took her about 15 hours
and it was then in there,

141
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,290
I had this innate understanding
of the power of this gift.

142
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:42,650
And I realized the only reason more
people didn't get it was because of how

143
00:08:42,651 --> 00:08:46,760
difficult it was to create.
So then in their tribute was born.

144
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,590
And so tribute is our website that
automates the process of building one of

145
00:08:51,591 --> 00:08:55,470
these gratitude filled video montage
is it automates the process of inviting

146
00:08:55,471 --> 00:08:57,390
your friends of collecting videos.

147
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:01,110
And we built the first web
based collaborative video
editor to easily put these

148
00:09:01,111 --> 00:09:05,250
things together. And it started as
a simple mission to share that joy,

149
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:08,880
those tears of wonder joy that I felt
in the back of the room with the world.

150
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,070
And last two years have been really fun.

151
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,180
So over 50,000 tributes in 40
countries around the world. Yep.

152
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:18,900
That's Regis checking us out on the today
show. That was appearance number two,

153
00:09:18,901 --> 00:09:21,660
which was very fun. Uh,
but most importantly,

154
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:26,220
what we're most excited about is that
we feel that we're deeply ingrained in

155
00:09:26,221 --> 00:09:30,810
this digital intimacy movement is that
we are an mission to leverage the power

156
00:09:30,811 --> 00:09:35,811
of video to spread gratitude and human
connection in the world is how can we

157
00:09:36,271 --> 00:09:39,720
build technology that adds
significant value to our users,

158
00:09:39,721 --> 00:09:41,790
offline relationships.

159
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,890
And we think that this is
not only something that we
are personally passionate

160
00:09:46,891 --> 00:09:47,161
about,

161
00:09:47,161 --> 00:09:51,510
but something that is incredibly relevant
right now because it's a society.

162
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:56,540
We are more connected than we have ever
been and we are quantifiably lonelier

163
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,800
than we have ever been.
At the same time,

164
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,060
in 1980 arp ran a study of
their entire membership,

165
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:08,010
the Association for Retired Persons in
1980 the number of people who identified

166
00:10:08,011 --> 00:10:11,100
as lonely was 20% that's a lot.

167
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:17,030
They did that same study in 2010 and the
number had doubled to 40% 40% of their

168
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:23,470
entire membership identifying as
lonely at the same time when they're

169
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:28,490
identifying more connections and more
acquaintances than they were in 1980 1980.

170
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:35,510
So next and even more alarming study
talking about in 1985 the American

171
00:10:36,451 --> 00:10:41,451
sociological review did a study and what
they found was that in 1985 the average

172
00:10:42,181 --> 00:10:46,530
person had three confidence,
three people that they could confide in,

173
00:10:46,531 --> 00:10:48,750
that they considered close friends.

174
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:54,230
When they redid that study in 2004 that
number dropped from a three to one close

175
00:10:54,661 --> 00:10:57,840
confidant to one close friend.

176
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:02,280
And to put it in even more perspective
of the people that they serve,

177
00:11:02,281 --> 00:11:03,900
I have the people that they surveyed,

178
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,310
25% said that they didn't have one
person that they could confide in.

179
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:13,380
25% are saying that they
essentially don't have one person,

180
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:16,770
they consider a close friend.
And that matters.

181
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,530
We just talked about what
happiness or excuse me,

182
00:11:19,531 --> 00:11:23,460
what relationships do for our happiness,
what it does for our help for health.

183
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,540
When people don't feel they belong,
they'll do crazy things to fit in.

184
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:32,490
So this is a human connection crisis.
Is this something that matters?

185
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,470
Something that deserves to be looked into.

186
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:40,200
So what's the role of technology
here at Google as an entrepreneur,

187
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:43,710
as a designer, how can we think
about tech's role in this?

188
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,410
And when we first started seeing
social media exploded onto the scene,

189
00:11:46,411 --> 00:11:49,440
there were a lot of surveys that
correlated loneliness and depression with

190
00:11:49,441 --> 00:11:51,420
increased exposure to
social media networks.

191
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,310
More research coming out today
actually has conflicting reports,

192
00:11:54,311 --> 00:11:56,410
whether it's actually lonely people,

193
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,040
depressed people who spend more time
on social media and on the Internet.

194
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,050
And so I want to move beyond that.

195
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:05,050
And when I focus on one thing
that the research does back up,

196
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:09,520
and that is that we get out of the
Internet, we get out of social media,

197
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,110
what we put into it.

198
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:13,000
Okay?

199
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,120
And the clearest example I can lay for
you guys is that if you're on Facebook,

200
00:12:16,121 --> 00:12:19,210
if you're browsing your
friend's profiles passively,

201
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,900
if you're taking what we call
the one click actions at tribute,

202
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:26,920
if you're just liking a photo, if you're
sending one on your friend's birthday,

203
00:12:26,921 --> 00:12:30,670
it's a trigger. That birthday message that
both of you know, it's like no thought,

204
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,970
no effort.
You are not adding to your social capital.

205
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,910
You're going to leave that
experience feeling more isolated.

206
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:41,260
But if you're going on to these platforms,
if you are composing messages,

207
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:44,110
if you are being thoughtful,
sending authentic birthday messages,

208
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,090
sharing the articles
that you're discovering,

209
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,340
then you are going to leave those
experiences more connected. So it be,

210
00:12:50,341 --> 00:12:54,400
when we think about in our design ethos
is what are the human values of the

211
00:12:54,401 --> 00:12:58,120
people that are using tribute as opposed
to the traditional KPIs of a tech

212
00:12:58,121 --> 00:13:02,410
product, of vitality, of
interactions, of growth, of revenue.

213
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:06,070
How do we quantify the
values of our users?

214
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,470
And that's why we have metrics like t o j,

215
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:13,740
which literally tracks the
number of recipients who
cried tears of joy and guess

216
00:13:14,801 --> 00:13:15,820
what that number is today?

217
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:21,840
80% 80% of those 50,000 reported
the recipient crying tears of joy,

218
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:26,680
quantifying the number of people who said,
I love you in their videos.

219
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:31,360
Quantifying the percentage of people who
feel more connected after giving their

220
00:13:31,361 --> 00:13:35,590
tribute. So we moved from things like
more interaction to what does a meaningful

221
00:13:35,591 --> 00:13:37,660
interaction quantified by our users.

222
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:41,830
Looking at ease and focusing
more on thoughtfulness.

223
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:45,760
What does a thoughtful interaction for
our user and looking at more connections

224
00:13:45,761 --> 00:13:49,630
and number of invitees and number of
friends and actually understanding what is

225
00:13:49,631 --> 00:13:54,580
a deep relationship look like and how
can we move towards those relationships.

226
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:03,130
And so if we understand that we need
to help people make these thoughtful,

227
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,210
thoughtful decisions for themselves,
that's the role of technology.

228
00:14:07,211 --> 00:14:10,050
That's what we can do to
help people as technologists,

229
00:14:10,051 --> 00:14:12,970
as designers is entrepreneurs.
And so I attribute,

230
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,580
we really believe in the
power of communication,

231
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,640
the power of communication
to help us connect.

232
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,710
And like I promised in
the beginning of the talk,

233
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:24,910
I really do want to help you guys walk
away from today with tangible techniques,

234
00:14:24,911 --> 00:14:28,810
things that you can use in everyday
interactions with friends, family,

235
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,970
networking events,
everything you've got.

236
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,260
So the first thing we want to
talk about is sharing gratitude.

237
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,190
Sharing gratitude may seem like a simple
thing in theory, but as we talked about,

238
00:14:39,191 --> 00:14:40,420
when we define connection,

239
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:43,660
appreciation is that first
cornerstone of meaningful connection.

240
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,190
And appreciation is powerful
for a few reasons. Number one,

241
00:14:48,191 --> 00:14:52,340
it allows the recipient to see those
qualities themselves that they sometimes

242
00:14:52,341 --> 00:14:54,230
may deny.
Second,

243
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:58,490
it reinforces those feelings
of appreciation and gratitude
that we have for that

244
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,353
other person.

245
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:03,050
So it's literally like a mini gratitude
meditation when you actually say and

246
00:15:03,051 --> 00:15:05,630
articulate your gratitude out loud.
And third,

247
00:15:05,631 --> 00:15:08,900
and most beautifully is when we
share a compliment with someone.

248
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,790
And recent research backs this up.

249
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,340
They're not only more likely
to reciprocate with us,

250
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:18,110
but they're more likely to give someone
a compliment in your local community.

251
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:22,370
So it creates this beautiful chain
reaction of gratitude every time we tell

252
00:15:22,371 --> 00:15:24,170
someone why we appreciate them.

253
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:29,450
And so now I want to introduce you to
a few of our favorite sharing gratitude

254
00:15:29,451 --> 00:15:33,080
techniques.
And so the first is not I love you.

255
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,140
The first is I love you because,

256
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:42,400
and one thing that we should understand
it is that it is not our articulation or

257
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:47,180
sentiment of affection that impacts the
recipient. So when I walk out the door,

258
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,070
it's not, I love you Mickey. That truly
impacts are it's, I love you Mickey,

259
00:15:52,071 --> 00:15:55,580
because you inspire me and you
support me as much as anyone I know.

260
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,530
It's not saying thank you to your
coworker. It's saying, thank you.

261
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:04,040
I was going through a really tough
week and this really helped me out.

262
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,470
It's when we go beyond that simple
sentiment of affection that the recipient

263
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:14,270
truly feels the meaning,
the intention of what we want to express.

264
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:17,090
It's that simple transition of,
I love you too.

265
00:16:17,091 --> 00:16:22,091
I love you because use that one word
and watch how it transforms the way that

266
00:16:22,311 --> 00:16:27,260
you communicate. The next is the
idea, the power of the prompt.

267
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:31,280
I was just talking about the fluorine
in the front row and it's the idea that

268
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:35,180
sharing our gratitude can sometimes
bring on a little bit of anxiety.

269
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,260
We don't want to tell someone how they've
impacted our lives are that we love

270
00:16:39,261 --> 00:16:42,080
them because we don't know
what they'll say back to us.

271
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,970
We don't know if they'll reciprocate.

272
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:48,140
We don't know if we'll make them
uncomfortable and when we don't know those

273
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:52,520
things, oftentimes we don't push
our boundaries. We just don't do it.

274
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:57,830
And so oftentimes we need these prompts.

275
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:02,300
We need to help people by giving them a
question that helps them to articulate

276
00:17:02,301 --> 00:17:03,620
their appreciation for someone.

277
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:08,090
So the way that we do this on tribute
is every campaign we do is based around

278
00:17:08,091 --> 00:17:12,470
prompt questions. So it's not what
do you love about Katia or sorry,

279
00:17:12,471 --> 00:17:17,210
it's not send Katia a birthday message.
It is. What do you love about Katya?

280
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,910
It is what's your favorite
memory with Katia?

281
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,790
How has Katia impacted your life?

282
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:28,280
So prompt questions allow you to unify
the conversation for an individual.

283
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:32,300
It automatically plants an emotional
sentiment in someone's brain.

284
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:36,020
So if you ask someone a question now
they're already have this feeling as

285
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:39,770
opposed to giving someone an open slate
and saying, film of birthday video,

286
00:17:39,771 --> 00:17:41,030
tell them you're grateful for them.

287
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,050
It's really when you provide that context
for creativity that people are more

288
00:17:45,051 --> 00:17:47,360
comfortable and compelled sharing.

289
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,750
So the challenge here would be the next
time that you're at a birthday dinner or

290
00:17:51,751 --> 00:17:55,410
the next time someone is taking off or
just basically landed a huge project,

291
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,990
the what we call a conversation catalyst.

292
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:02,460
Be the person who stops the dinner and
says, Hey, we're all here for Heather.

293
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,320
Let's go around the table and everyone's,

294
00:18:04,321 --> 00:18:08,490
tell her what's your favorite thing about
Heather via conversation catalyst and

295
00:18:08,491 --> 00:18:11,490
watch how that unites your group,
your community,

296
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:16,050
and how impactful that will be on the
person that you folks do you focus on.

297
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,873
Does that make sense?

298
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,833
Okay,

299
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:25,630
awesome.
So the next one is another simple one.

300
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:26,561
Uh,

301
00:18:26,561 --> 00:18:31,561
and it's the idea of being nice first is
that so often we wait for permission to

302
00:18:32,501 --> 00:18:37,150
share that kindness that we
feel the gratitude, we feel
the thanks that we feel.

303
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,220
And the way that I want to kind of ground
this in your memory banks is to think

304
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,980
about that saying that we all
heard a thousand times growing up.

305
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:48,130
So you tease a kid on the playground,
you're mom would see you,

306
00:18:48,131 --> 00:18:51,820
she'd come over to you and she'd say,
if you don't have anything nice to say,

307
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:57,250
don't say it at all.
So watch this.

308
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:01,450
If you look at those two
don'ts and you get rid of them,

309
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:06,220
you know what it becomes. If you don't,
or if you have anything nice to say.

310
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,043
Say it all.

311
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,280
It's this simple idea that whenever
we have a kind feeling a compliment,

312
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,720
we feel thankful for someone.

313
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,380
There is no good reason to ever
keep that inside of your head.

314
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,750
Just think about any
time you've ever been,

315
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,540
you ever received a compliment and said,
gross

316
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,930
never happened.
So if you have anything nice to say,

317
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,640
say it all.

318
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,290
So next I want to move into our second
part of the communication techniques,

319
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:43,950
and that's something that we call
the art of meaningful conversation.

320
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,391
Before we move into this,

321
00:19:45,391 --> 00:19:49,470
does anyone have any questions about
that first element of sharing gratitude,

322
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,540
articulating our gratitude
and appreciation?

323
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:54,640
Yeah.

324
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,380
We'll open up for questions
at the end as well.

325
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:00,910
So the art of meaningful conversation
is grounded in the idea that human

326
00:20:00,911 --> 00:20:03,730
connection starts with communication.

327
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:08,470
So the art of meaningful conversation
is about overcoming anxiety.

328
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:12,490
It's about adding value in conversation.
It's about listening attentively.

329
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:15,700
It's about connecting and feeling
confident in any social interaction.

330
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:20,890
And we can think about it broken up this
way, fam. Finding your authentic voice,

331
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,320
asking better questions.

332
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:27,310
And the metamorphic to
step to translate presence.

333
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,280
So before we get into that,

334
00:20:30,281 --> 00:20:34,660
I want to address something that is the
biggest deterrent and barrier to human

335
00:20:34,661 --> 00:20:38,860
connection in my opinion.
And that is social anxiety and shyness.

336
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,820
And so again, I want to define
social anxiety in clear terms.

337
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,810
Social anxiety can be defined
as the fear of negative.

338
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,220
The social anxiety is the
fear of negative judgment.

339
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:55,690
And another thing that I want to establish
is that recent research shows that

340
00:20:55,691 --> 00:21:00,610
about 60% of all people say that they
are dealing with some issues of social

341
00:21:00,611 --> 00:21:04,030
anxiety or shyness.
It is not rare.

342
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,690
And when we were dealing with
social anxiety or shyness,

343
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:12,100
we have an aversion to social interaction
is going to keep us from dating the

344
00:21:12,101 --> 00:21:14,950
people we want to date from meeting
the friends we want to be friends with,

345
00:21:14,951 --> 00:21:18,400
from getting the job that we deserve.
And so again,

346
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:22,120
if social anxiety is simply the
fear of being negatively judged,

347
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,180
some people leap to the assumption that
we should just stop caring what people

348
00:21:25,181 --> 00:21:28,420
think.
But that is not the path to connection.

349
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:33,610
That is an easy path to narcissism.
And sometimes the White House.

350
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:42,180
So we can start by finding our authentic
voice and the authentic voice is this

351
00:21:43,691 --> 00:21:46,360
deep understanding of who we are,

352
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,810
what we care about and what we want.

353
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:55,570
And the reason that this is so important
is that if we don't know who we are,

354
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:57,280
what we stand for,

355
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:02,500
we will constantly revert
to seeking validation from
others is that we will need

356
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,900
other people to tell
us what is acceptable,

357
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:09,430
what is cool as opposed to being
driven by our own intuition,

358
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,650
morals,
values.

359
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:17,320
And there's a simple test that
you can use in any situation,

360
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,960
whether you're in a meeting at Google,
whether you're in a party,

361
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,910
whether you had Thanksgiving
dinner with your family.

362
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,930
Net simple test is this one question,

363
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:32,010
am I doing this because I want to be or
because I think people will like it or

364
00:22:33,581 --> 00:22:38,170
think it looks cool and the clearest
example I can give you of this and we've

365
00:22:38,171 --> 00:22:41,110
all been there, don't even lie that
you haven't is you're at a party,

366
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:43,720
your friends haven't showed up and then
you pull out your phone and you're just

367
00:22:43,721 --> 00:22:46,060
looking at it doing absolutely nothing.

368
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:49,030
Like everyone just smiled
so we'd been there.

369
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:52,000
It's you don't want to just
do nothing on your phone.

370
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:54,670
You're doing that because you're worried
about the perception of other people

371
00:22:54,671 --> 00:22:56,650
thinking you're weird
or whatever it might be.

372
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:01,210
And the easiest construct that you can
think about in these moments is am I

373
00:23:01,211 --> 00:23:04,840
being driven by internal
motivation or external motivation,

374
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:10,810
internal versus external.
Why am I doing what I'm doing right now?

375
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:15,160
Always ask yourself and remind yourself
to revert back to that internal

376
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:18,520
motivation and we can all start.
Here's another challenge,

377
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:23,730
how to find your authentic voice starts
by articulating your answers to these

378
00:23:23,801 --> 00:23:26,560
questions and too many of
them I hope that you do.

379
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,600
You have a feeling and
understanding of these,

380
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:31,360
but when you actually take
the time to answer them,

381
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:34,870
to put the words that
these questions deserve,

382
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:38,560
you'll go in to social
interactions with more power,

383
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,320
a higher understanding of yourself,

384
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,920
and it will translate to
greater presence and greater.

385
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:49,040
And one of the beautiful things I think
about when I look at questions like this

386
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:52,490
is that the answers will always change.

387
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:55,550
And that's okay.
That's a beautiful part of life.

388
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,620
The questions will remain the same,

389
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:02,240
but just the mere fact that these answers
will change is not an excuse for not

390
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:03,170
having an answer.

391
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:07,910
So meaningful conversation starts with
us in establishing that understanding of

392
00:24:07,911 --> 00:24:08,744
self.

393
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,900
So the second is to ask better questions.

394
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:18,100
And one thing that we can establish when
we think about asking better questions

395
00:24:18,101 --> 00:24:23,101
is a path to human connection or these
two things is that when we're asking

396
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:25,570
questions and listening attentively,

397
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:30,160
we will always leave a good
impression on our counterpart.

398
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:33,700
And beyond that we will
always make them feel valued.

399
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,460
So we are asking questions and listening.

400
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:40,900
You are always going to leave a positive
impression on the person that you're

401
00:24:40,901 --> 00:24:42,940
speaking with.
On top of that,

402
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:47,380
questions are the most effective
path for learning and growth.

403
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:49,750
If we are learning,
if we are growing,

404
00:24:49,751 --> 00:24:54,520
there is always fulfillment to be had
there. And as our pal Gandhi said,

405
00:24:55,660 --> 00:25:00,490
when you talk, you are merely repeating
what you know. When you listen,

406
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:04,210
you may learn something new.
And again,

407
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:07,280
I love these constructs that
allow you to evaluate, um,

408
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,890
how you're being in any given moment.

409
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:13,600
And another question that you can think
about whatever you go into a meeting

410
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:17,650
before you go to your next conference,
ask yourself this one question.

411
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,760
What am I most excited to
learn about this person?

412
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:28,170
It's actually taking 60 seconds before
you hop on that call and just identifying

413
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:30,400
what am I most curious about?

414
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:34,000
When you establish a foundation of
curiosity to take him to any social

415
00:25:34,001 --> 00:25:34,834
interaction,

416
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:39,520
you now have a virtuous path through
that entire interaction because of those

417
00:25:39,521 --> 00:25:43,660
two things we established
before articulating our
curiosity will lead us into

418
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:46,690
virtuous connection in every interaction.
You can trust that.

419
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:49,120
Here's another one of those constructs.

420
00:25:49,121 --> 00:25:54,070
The idea of being interested
over interesting and it
actually should be an equal

421
00:25:54,071 --> 00:25:56,260
sign there.
It should say that if you are interested,

422
00:25:56,590 --> 00:26:01,240
you are interesting and you will be
received well by other people. And again,

423
00:26:01,241 --> 00:26:03,880
this incredible quote by Einstein,
I have no special talent.

424
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,860
I'm only passionately curious.

425
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,950
And the idea of going through
life to understand people,

426
00:26:08,951 --> 00:26:11,560
to understand the world in my opinion,

427
00:26:11,561 --> 00:26:15,700
is just one of the best ways to experience
life and something we can all aspire

428
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,653
towards.

429
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:22,210
And you can also help yourself by giving
a foundation of questions that I call

430
00:26:22,211 --> 00:26:25,120
your go tos,
is that give yourself a leg up.

431
00:26:25,121 --> 00:26:28,420
I've been talking about human connection
and relationships for so many years,

432
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:32,890
but at the end of the day I revert back
to the same questions because there was

433
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:33,551
a through line,

434
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:36,940
there was a theme to what I want to
understand about the people I meet.

435
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,250
So if you think about these questions,

436
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:41,710
you can trust yourself
to fall back to these,

437
00:26:41,711 --> 00:26:45,870
these more virtuous paths of communication
and conversation in any given moment.

438
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:49,290
So think about what yours are.
Here's a few that I've always loved.

439
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,680
What are you most excited about?
What's most challenging right now?

440
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,810
Because when we talk about
challenge and struggle,

441
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:58,230
we opened up an opportunity to
support and to be supported.

442
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,880
What's your fee? What's your focus at
the moment? What's important right now?

443
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:06,810
What's the dream?
Identifying what people really want to do.

444
00:27:06,811 --> 00:27:10,290
And you guys want to talk about
your dreams or your day job. Oh,

445
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:12,210
you guys work at Google.
So it was probably very cool.

446
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:14,400
About the same time
talking about our dreams.

447
00:27:14,401 --> 00:27:17,580
What we really want is where
we can find that energy,

448
00:27:17,581 --> 00:27:19,680
that passion and the stuff that
we really want to connect on.

449
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:21,210
What do you care about?

450
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:25,230
That's simple question to get
to what is important to people,

451
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,170
which is an incredible thing to
understand and get to know someone.

452
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:32,520
So the Max is probably the simplest step
of all these things that we're going to

453
00:27:32,521 --> 00:27:35,580
talk about in the art of
meaningful conversation. Um,

454
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:39,030
and so the reason that we need this
is because presence is tantamount.

455
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:42,660
If we want to connect with people,
if we have a negative internal dialog,

456
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:43,830
if we're thinking about other things,

457
00:27:43,831 --> 00:27:47,040
if I'm not right here to talk to
you and to look you in the eyes,

458
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:51,180
I'm not fully capable of articulating
myself. I can't listen to you fully.

459
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,890
And so presence is important.

460
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:58,460
And another thing to identify is that
our brains priority is not to connect our

461
00:27:58,861 --> 00:28:00,750
brains.
Priority is to keep us safe.

462
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:04,200
And our brain is really good at telling
us all the things that are going to go

463
00:28:04,201 --> 00:28:04,980
wrong.

464
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,740
Our brain is really good at taking us
into the meeting and telling us why this

465
00:28:07,741 --> 00:28:11,100
person's not going to invest in us about
why this person is not going to like us.

466
00:28:11,101 --> 00:28:13,260
They're not going to think I'm smart.
They're not going to think I'm pretty,

467
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:14,700
whatever it might be.

468
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:20,090
And so we need to remind our brain
what feeling good looks like.

469
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,240
We need to remind our brain
what we want to happen.

470
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:25,980
And so it's again,

471
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:31,440
this simple two step process that I
learned from a hypnotherapist in New York

472
00:28:31,441 --> 00:28:35,190
City. I remember I walked into a
party, I met this guy and I said,

473
00:28:35,191 --> 00:28:36,360
so what do you do?
And he's like,

474
00:28:36,361 --> 00:28:38,310
well I'm a hypnotherapist and
I stopped them and I said,

475
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,950
I'm going to coronary you and
ask you a hundred questions.

476
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:45,210
Are you okay with that? And he was like,
yes. And so the first thing I asked is,

477
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,630
so what's the number one thing
that people try to get rid of?

478
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:52,320
And what do you guys think it is?
Smoking is the one everyone says,

479
00:28:52,321 --> 00:28:56,250
that's what I said too, but it is
not smoking. He said self doubt.

480
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,960
Self doubt is a number one thing that
hypnotherapist are asked to cure.

481
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,660
And so then I went down this
line of questioning. I said,

482
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,120
so if you want to cure someone
of self doubt, what do you do?

483
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:10,740
And he said that the first step is
articulating the undesired state.

484
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:15,240
So putting words to this negative feeling
because then it has less control over

485
00:29:15,241 --> 00:29:18,270
us. So it's again, before you go into
that meeting, it's actually saying,

486
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:19,920
what's going to go wrong?

487
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,560
How do I not want to feel those
things that we just talked about?

488
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:23,610
They're not going to think I'm smart.

489
00:29:23,611 --> 00:29:25,890
They're not going to think I'm experienced
enough. We're not going to connect.

490
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:28,260
That's the undesired state of being.

491
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,900
And so this one little question in step
two can change everything and we'll take

492
00:29:33,901 --> 00:29:37,230
you 15 seconds before you go
into any meaningful interaction.

493
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:42,790
How do I want to feel?
How do I want to feel?

494
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:46,630
So before I stepped foot
in this room today, I ask
myself, how do I want to feel?

495
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:51,250
And I said, I want to be passionate. I
want to be myself. I want to feel loose,

496
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,160
so happy, passionate, loose HPL.

497
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,300
Now I have three things and whenever I
have any sort of doubt or anything that

498
00:29:58,301 --> 00:29:59,320
takes me out of the moment,

499
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:02,860
I have these three desired states
of being and then I can tap into.

500
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:07,750
Right now I am here as Andrew
the way that I want to be.

501
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:12,430
I promise you that if you just ground
yourself in the metamorphic to step before

502
00:30:12,431 --> 00:30:13,360
any important meeting,

503
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:17,320
it will transform your ability
to connect in that conversation.

504
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:22,330
Does that make sense? How
do I want to feel? Awesome.

505
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,830
Um, so we're about to close.
And before we do that,

506
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:31,600
I want to invite you guys into a
quick 62nd gratitude meditation.

507
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:36,430
So if you guys will just sit back
in your chairs, literally 60 seconds

508
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:41,380
and you can close your eyes,
you can open your eyes,

509
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:43,810
whatever you're most comfortable with.

510
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,310
So what I'd like you to do is
close your eyes if you'd like to.

511
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:49,990
And on the count of three,

512
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:54,610
we're going to take one big breath in one,

513
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:56,890
two,
three.

514
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,500
And now with your eyes closed,

515
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:09,000
just feel the sensation of
your breath as it goes in,

516
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,830
as it goes out.

517
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:16,530
And now I'd like you to think about
one person that you're grateful for

518
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:21,660
who is one person that's
had an impact on your life,

519
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:27,540
whether it's a mom, a dad, a
best friend, a significant other.

520
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:31,410
And just imagine that person
sitting right in front of you.

521
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,200
They're just looking right back at you.

522
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:39,360
And now I want you guys to remember,
I love you because,

523
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:43,170
and I want you to articulate
why you're grateful for them.

524
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,080
Why do you love them

525
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:49,930
and sit with that for a moment.

526
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:56,860
And on the count of three we're
going to open our eyes. Three,

527
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:58,863
two,

528
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,313
one.

529
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:04,470
I want you to take a look at
what's on the screen right now.

530
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:11,040
If you have anything nice to say,
say it all.

531
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,450
There is no reason to keep that kindness,

532
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:19,410
that gratitude that you feel
for that person who impacted
your life in your head,

533
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,290
that life is an incredible gift.

534
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:27,030
And to experience it with the people
we love isn't even greater gift.

535
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:32,160
So my last challenge and invitation to
you guys today as we close out is if

536
00:32:32,161 --> 00:32:34,680
you'd like to at some point
today or right after this talk,

537
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:37,170
is texts that gratitude to this person.

538
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:41,600
See how it makes you see
how it makes them feel.

539
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,260
And hopefully you take this
into your life moving forward.

540
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,090
Thank you so much guys.

541
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,113
Okay.

542
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:59,190
Oh and we actually have one final thing.
So this is John Tributes,

543
00:32:59,191 --> 00:33:03,270
community manager in the back. And so
in the vein of Google and free stuff,

544
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:07,260
we're going to give you guys a gift
card to create your first tribute on the

545
00:33:07,261 --> 00:33:10,890
house. So there's probably about
70 of you guys that are here.

546
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,740
So I want to make sure that you guys get
to do this, whether it's for a birthday,

547
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:16,770
a wedding, a bar Mitzvah,
anything special coming up.

548
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:20,190
And for those of you that are online
watching this, if you tweet out,

549
00:33:20,191 --> 00:33:24,870
we tribute and this talk will also reach
out to you with a free $19 gift card to

550
00:33:24,871 --> 00:33:28,170
create your first DIY tribute.
Awesome.

551
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:33,570
If there's any questions, I think I'll
look at Katia to see how we do that. But,

552
00:33:33,571 --> 00:33:34,404
um,

553
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:38,340
I love to field any questions about kind
of our research in the field or how we

554
00:33:38,341 --> 00:33:39,780
got tributes started.
Whatever's on your mind.

555
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,400
So here,
there's a microphone right here.

556
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:49,300
Hi, great talk. Thank you. Um,
so before I came to Google,

557
00:33:49,301 --> 00:33:52,000
I was a school counselor at
[inaudible] high school in the Bronx,

558
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,430
working with teenage girls.

559
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,930
And a lot of what you said kind of makes
me a little nervous for the younger

560
00:33:58,931 --> 00:34:03,820
generations. Um, just because the style
of communication now is all they know.

561
00:34:03,821 --> 00:34:07,900
And I think for a lot of us in this room
kind of got the best of both worlds.

562
00:34:07,901 --> 00:34:12,010
So we have the ability to tap
into a lot of what you said. Um,

563
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:14,830
so I'm just curious if you've thought
at all about how to reach a younger

564
00:34:14,831 --> 00:34:17,740
audience or, um, how to
kind of tackle those things.

565
00:34:17,741 --> 00:34:22,020
Cause I found it really hard for
the girls to a be vulnerable. Um,

566
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:24,430
and that whole like self doubt thing,
they were,

567
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:28,230
they had no confidence in themselves.
Yeah. So just curious, like your tea,

568
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,340
I don't know,
ideas on targeting a younger

569
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:32,680
yeah. You know, so, so tributes,

570
00:34:32,681 --> 00:34:36,160
target demographics and where we
focus on is on the 18 and above,

571
00:34:36,161 --> 00:34:39,460
so where people kind of have a little
more emotional intelligence and are

572
00:34:39,461 --> 00:34:40,900
capable of articulating these things.

573
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,480
So it's not where I've spent
most of my time at tribute,

574
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:47,740
but it was where I spent a great deal of
my time, uh, with dreams for kids. Um,

575
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:51,850
and I think that what we always lead
with when it comes to kids again,

576
00:34:51,851 --> 00:34:55,120
are some of these values that we talked
about of leading with kindness before we

577
00:34:55,121 --> 00:34:59,020
get to the communication aspect is
establishing that as a foundation of

578
00:34:59,021 --> 00:35:02,020
interaction between people of
just being able to ask yourself,

579
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:06,510
is this a kind thing? And so, I mean,
when we were at dreams for kids, um,

580
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:07,840
we had this,
uh,

581
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:10,960
this thing that we embrace at any one of
our events because we were dealing with

582
00:35:10,961 --> 00:35:15,580
a lot of kids with disabilities
is if you're ever unsure,

583
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:17,530
uh,
the,

584
00:35:17,531 --> 00:35:21,190
the general consensus was that you just
go over and you ask and everyone just

585
00:35:21,191 --> 00:35:22,360
seeks to understand.

586
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:26,740
And it was basically setting this
baseline of understanding between people

587
00:35:26,741 --> 00:35:30,790
rather than making judgments and all
these other things. So I think, again,

588
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,800
you know, I don't do a lot
of work directly with kids,

589
00:35:32,801 --> 00:35:37,290
but I think that establishing
that understanding of
seeking to understand your

590
00:35:37,291 --> 00:35:41,490
counterpart and asking questions will
still be a virtuous path. Right. I mean,

591
00:35:41,491 --> 00:35:43,530
when you think about
your time as a counselor,

592
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:46,740
what were the biggest challenges that
young girls who were finding with being

593
00:35:46,741 --> 00:35:47,140
vulnerable?

594
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,650
Just that they were being attacked or
they weren't receiving that back to them

595
00:35:49,651 --> 00:35:49,950
or,

596
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:52,920
yeah, a little bit of everything.
I think part of it was to, like,

597
00:35:52,921 --> 00:35:57,921
they couldn't find an authentic voice
because everything was done for like,

598
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:02,720
uh, like on Instagram or it's for a
retweet or whatever. It was like the,

599
00:36:02,721 --> 00:36:06,720
and they would give each other compliments
like on Instagram just to get it back

600
00:36:06,721 --> 00:36:10,650
so that they could look at it and say,
I have 500 comments of how great I look.

601
00:36:10,651 --> 00:36:11,484
You know,
so

602
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:14,100
I'm so happy you said that because it
really did just trigger something in me.

603
00:36:14,101 --> 00:36:16,200
And, um, you know, my
reality is that I was,

604
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:19,320
I wasn't a great student throughout
high school and even college.

605
00:36:19,321 --> 00:36:21,600
It's kind of like I went through and I,
I got grades,

606
00:36:21,601 --> 00:36:24,900
but I was never fully present
their value, valued it. Um,

607
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:28,110
and no kind of guidance,
no speakers,

608
00:36:28,111 --> 00:36:33,000
no counselors ever connected with me and
gave me insight or advice about how to

609
00:36:33,001 --> 00:36:36,030
evaluate the world or how I want it to
live, my life that really connected.

610
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:39,630
And so when we talk about starting with
the art of meaningful conversation and

611
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:40,464
questions,

612
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:44,790
I think that that again is the best place
to start because if you empower young

613
00:36:44,791 --> 00:36:49,290
people at a young age with a
foundational sense of self, who they are,

614
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:52,800
what's important to them, I
think that that's the most
important thing. And again,

615
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,470
you can give that to a
younger person and say,

616
00:36:55,471 --> 00:36:58,800
here are some of the questions
that you can explore for yourself.

617
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:02,880
And when you can relate that directly
back to social anxiety and shyness and

618
00:37:02,881 --> 00:37:06,450
some of those things that are much more
prevalent in high school and college,

619
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:10,380
then what happens is that you give
people a foundation to say before you can

620
00:37:10,381 --> 00:37:12,120
feel confident in these situations.

621
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,030
Like the most important
thing is truly understanding,

622
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:18,890
trusting and loving yourself.
And so we can give that to young people.

623
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,600
I think that that's always where I would
start is not telling you when to do

624
00:37:21,601 --> 00:37:25,230
anything, but providing them with a
construct to actually perform that kind of

625
00:37:25,231 --> 00:37:28,800
introspection that leads to
virtuous interactions, connection,

626
00:37:28,801 --> 00:37:30,420
connecting with the type
of people that we need to.

627
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:31,221
Yeah.

628
00:37:31,221 --> 00:37:34,160
It's like almost trying
to get it proactive rather
than reactive because that

629
00:37:34,161 --> 00:37:37,790
was like the, we were like trying to put
out fires almost, you know, and it was,

630
00:37:37,791 --> 00:37:39,160
yeah,
it was hard to do at that point.

631
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:42,050
Yeah. My, my mom always says that the, uh,

632
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:44,300
the wisest teachers are the greatest

633
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:49,100
question askers and so that's what I
would emphasize. Cool. Thank you. Yeah,

634
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:49,963
absolutely.

635
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:59,590
Ah, this was a really welcome
interruption in the day. Uh,

636
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:03,090
I imagine the people in this room are
fairly self selecting group. Yeah.

637
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:06,900
As far as being concerned about
these kinds of issues. Uh,

638
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:09,020
can you talk about times where,

639
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:12,050
especially as somebody who's used
to being called intense. Yeah.

640
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,320
First meetings now, uh, for a lot
of the reasons you've discussed,

641
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:19,640
how do you navigate this when you're
meeting somebody who is unwilling to meet

642
00:38:19,641 --> 00:38:22,790
you at that level and who
was uncomfortable with
these kinds of questions or

643
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:25,760
thinks that this is extremely unnatural?

644
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:28,650
Yeah, absolutely. Um, do you want to,

645
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:30,850
are you speaking in a business
context or social? Sure.

646
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:36,160
I think it applies to both. I think I'd
be curious. Yes, please. Let's start

647
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:36,993
with social.

648
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,150
And this is something that I've had
to come to grips with as well as, um,

649
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,320
you know, again, dealing with, you know,

650
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:44,680
my own anxieties and shyness with social
interaction and how I wanted to show up

651
00:38:44,681 --> 00:38:46,060
in the world.
Uh,

652
00:38:46,061 --> 00:38:50,410
one thing that I've become very clear
on later in life is that it is not our

653
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:53,830
responsibility to make
people feel comfortable.

654
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:57,550
It is our responsibility
to be honest to ourselves.

655
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:00,490
And this is within the construct
of, again, leading with kindness,

656
00:39:00,491 --> 00:39:03,340
is that we cannot harm people.
So we need to lead with kindness,

657
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:07,120
but that ultimately it is not our
responsibility to make people comfortable.

658
00:39:07,121 --> 00:39:11,200
It is our responsibility to be honest
with ourselves. And if we're exact,

659
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:14,860
if we're accepting some
of these principles about
asking questions and knowing

660
00:39:14,861 --> 00:39:19,630
who we are, uh, and being fully
present, I think that, um, you know,

661
00:39:19,631 --> 00:39:23,410
sometimes you are going to interact
with people who don't connect with you,

662
00:39:23,411 --> 00:39:24,670
who are not on your frequency.

663
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:29,890
And I think that knowing that you showed
up in integrity in those moments as

664
00:39:29,891 --> 00:39:33,220
yourself allows you to
not get hung up on them,

665
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,390
allows you to move forward. And
the reality is that, you know,

666
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,050
you only have limited time on this earth.

667
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:43,440
And so those people who aren't able to
meet you where you're at are oftentimes

668
00:39:43,841 --> 00:39:45,850
not those people that you're
going to connect with. You know,

669
00:39:45,851 --> 00:39:49,450
I'd say that again in a
professional context. Um, you know,

670
00:39:49,451 --> 00:39:54,130
seeking to understand people is this
virtuous path where if people aren't going

671
00:39:54,131 --> 00:39:58,060
to meet you all the way it, what's
your dream? And you're meeting them at,

672
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:00,280
you know, whether it's like
Penn station, whatever it is,

673
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:04,540
I think that there's a way that you
can start earlier on to get there.

674
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:08,620
And so again, I think that just because
someone can't meet you, they're like,

675
00:40:08,621 --> 00:40:09,890
if you were to break down again,

676
00:40:09,891 --> 00:40:11,950
and you talked about when
we were chatting right here,

677
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:15,170
like your perception of people
right off the bat. And, um,

678
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,330
I love the idea that your first
question is not your real question,

679
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,640
is that for a lot of people,

680
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:23,800
like they won't be able to
go there right off the bat.

681
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:28,270
So what is another question right after
that that you can go into? And again,

682
00:40:28,271 --> 00:40:31,360
just allowing yourself to lead with
curiosity and what you want to know about

683
00:40:31,361 --> 00:40:31,871
that person.

684
00:40:31,871 --> 00:40:36,010
So if they're not willing to talk about
their dreams are what they care about,

685
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:40,630
um, what do you want to know about them
and why they're not willing to go there.

686
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:44,260
It's again, just giving yourself to that
process and seeing where that takes you,

687
00:40:44,261 --> 00:40:48,570
I think is, I'm always going to be a
virtuous path. That makes sense. Yeah.

688
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,320
Thank you.

689
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,153
Cool.

690
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,413
Yeah,

691
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:05,140
it's touching again on the subject of,
of, you know, younger, a younger people,

692
00:41:05,141 --> 00:41:09,880
children, you know, as they're
relatively new father. Um, and,

693
00:41:09,881 --> 00:41:13,680
uh, you know, speaking from my own
experience on Facebook, you know, it's,

694
00:41:13,681 --> 00:41:18,010
it's been my feeling pretty early on that,
you know,

695
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:23,160
a lot of people I know have exchanged a
few meaningful relationships with a lot

696
00:41:25,181 --> 00:41:28,240
of meaningless ones. Yeah. And
a lot of really shallow ones.

697
00:41:28,241 --> 00:41:32,920
So really kind of replaced depth with
breadth and we're not talking to each

698
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:35,540
other anymore where it
broadcasting. Yeah. Right.

699
00:41:35,541 --> 00:41:39,720
And we're advertising so to speak.
And, uh, at least some of us do. And,

700
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:44,840
and it's certainly the
experience on Facebook, you
know, browsing Facebook, uh, uh,

701
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:45,200
it's,

702
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:50,200
it's an in this capable experience
of comparison and since you quoted,

703
00:41:50,691 --> 00:41:53,210
but in a brown, I'm sure you
know her works and, you know,

704
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:57,470
comparison is the pathway to feeling less,

705
00:41:57,471 --> 00:42:01,550
to feeling ashamed. Um, and I'm kind of,

706
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:06,410
and I feel that I myself, you know, I'm
fairly immune to, had, not completely,

707
00:42:06,411 --> 00:42:11,411
at least I'm smart enough to avoid
exposing myself to too much of that.

708
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,450
Um, how, what, what are,

709
00:42:14,451 --> 00:42:19,451
are there tangible things that we can do
to help children develop that immunity

710
00:42:23,211 --> 00:42:28,211
to the inescapable world around us where
there'll be a lot of people that are

711
00:42:28,971 --> 00:42:32,930
shallow or there'll be a lot of people
that will judge them using meaningless

712
00:42:32,931 --> 00:42:36,980
tools like likes or, or
etc. And um, you know,

713
00:42:36,981 --> 00:42:41,270
obviously developing self worth,
developing integrity,

714
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:43,820
these are principles I
can easily agree with.

715
00:42:43,821 --> 00:42:48,380
But are there good tricks to
do that I guess is my question?

716
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,530
Absolutely. Well, expand on the,

717
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:54,400
the comparison a theme and then get
right back into how we can apply this to

718
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:58,020
young people and their browsing
and social media habits. Um,

719
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,320
one of my favorite concepts
with comparison, um,

720
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:04,900
is the idea that comparison
is the thief of joy.

721
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:10,620
And I just noticed this in any given
moment where I find myself comparing to a

722
00:43:11,141 --> 00:43:14,110
competitor to someone else
who's finding success.

723
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:19,390
And in those moments where
you feel jealousy or anxious,

724
00:43:19,391 --> 00:43:22,150
whatever it might be when
you're comparing. Um,

725
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:25,810
my first thought there and what I've
trained myself to do is to realize that

726
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:29,710
that comparison and that
malice or whatever it might be,

727
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,890
is nothing.
It has nothing to do with that person.

728
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:35,770
It's purely internal and it
says something about myself.

729
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:40,990
And so I think about the transformation
of comparing to celebrating,

730
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:45,850
which is what we want to do is that if
we cannot celebrate the successes of

731
00:43:45,851 --> 00:43:46,720
other people,

732
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:51,910
it only says something about
us and our own insecurities.

733
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:57,070
So it's that shift from comparing to
celebrating. And if we cannot celebrate,

734
00:43:57,310 --> 00:44:00,430
we can acknowledge that it's because of
our own insecurities and something to be

735
00:44:00,431 --> 00:44:04,750
worked on because no one is perfect.
Um, and as it relates to young people,

736
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:09,670
I think again, rather than
telling them what to do, uh,

737
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,810
the best thing that we can do with
young people is to ask them why they are

738
00:44:13,811 --> 00:44:17,800
doing things and to help them come
to their own realizations. And again,

739
00:44:17,801 --> 00:44:18,401
how we do that.

740
00:44:18,401 --> 00:44:21,370
It was with good questions and I'll
revert back to one that we talked about

741
00:44:21,371 --> 00:44:22,090
earlier,

742
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:25,690
which is if you have a young person
who's posting on Instagram or is typing

743
00:44:25,691 --> 00:44:29,590
these types of comments to simply
ask them like why are you doing that?

744
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:34,050
And to see kind of answer
that they actually have to
actually help them identify

745
00:44:34,051 --> 00:44:37,680
those motivations for themselves to
see if it's something that they like.

746
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:39,360
And again, it's, you know,

747
00:44:39,361 --> 00:44:43,500
we all remember our younger years and
it's like we are hardwired to rebel and so

748
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:46,770
when someone is telling us that
this is the way to do something,

749
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,130
we're going to be very resistant for
anyone to tell us what to do when we're

750
00:44:50,131 --> 00:44:51,630
still formulating our own identity.

751
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:55,680
But when we can give people a construct
to do that meaningful introspection for

752
00:44:55,681 --> 00:44:56,490
themself,

753
00:44:56,490 --> 00:44:59,580
I think that that is probably the most
effective path to help them evaluate

754
00:44:59,581 --> 00:45:01,380
those things.
So it's again,

755
00:45:01,381 --> 00:45:05,490
it's just understanding why they're doing
those things and hopefully encouraging

756
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:09,150
designers and people at Google to be
thoughtful about how we are designing

757
00:45:09,151 --> 00:45:11,010
products and what we're
defining as success.

758
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:12,110
Okay.

759
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:13,550
Thank you. Yeah, absolutely.

760
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:20,543
Anyone else?

761
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:24,320
One more or a few more.

762
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:32,800
Yeah, man, if you, uh, if you
emailed John attribute.co,

763
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:35,050
he'll be sure to send these out.
Thanks man.

764
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:40,120
Hi, I'm a huge fan. I'm doctor Rene
Brown. So you had me at Bernay Brown.

765
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:44,830
So I wanted to just ask if
you had any statistics on,

766
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,430
cause she talks a little bit about
this and several of her books,

767
00:45:48,431 --> 00:45:52,570
but on how the expression of gratitude
is what actually gives you joy. Mm.

768
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:55,460
So do you have any, um, like are you,

769
00:45:55,461 --> 00:46:00,461
is your company doing any type of
like studies on people that actually

770
00:46:00,521 --> 00:46:05,470
participate in this and like their
levels of joy going up as a result of the

771
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:07,990
expression of gratitude? I would
just be interested to see that data.

772
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:12,080
Yeah. You know, so we partnered
with a nonprofit called, uh,

773
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:15,080
the grateful network. And so
again, they're doing a lot
of leading edge research,

774
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:18,910
uh, research along with the greater
good science center, which is, um,

775
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:20,990
a unit outside of UC Berkeley.

776
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:23,930
And they're doing some of the leading
edge research about the practice of

777
00:46:23,931 --> 00:46:25,610
gratitude and what it's doing on the mine.

778
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:29,600
And so we have our internal metrics that
we talked about in terms of actually

779
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:30,860
quantifying,
uh,

780
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:35,210
expressions of love within these videos
of actually quantifying this act of

781
00:46:35,211 --> 00:46:38,930
sharing gratitude, how that improves
your connectivity with your community.

782
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:42,130
And so right now again, these
50,000 people who've done it, um,

783
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:45,510
right now you're looking at 99%
of people who say that, you know,

784
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,750
the act of sharing this gratitude
for someone they cared about it,

785
00:46:47,751 --> 00:46:51,630
made them feel more connected to their
community and tears of joy are now call

786
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:53,780
wonder joy. Um, so you can provide that.

787
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:56,390
But I'd say that those
are probably two of the,

788
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:59,150
like the networks that I check out
with more of the kind of leading edge

789
00:46:59,151 --> 00:46:59,984
research.

790
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:02,990
So something that we're
kind of piggybacking off of
them to apply that into our

791
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:06,610
kind of like a in our design and
our development. Awesome. Thank you.

792
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:11,000
Thanks so much. So if you have
anything nice to say, say it all.

793
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:13,460
One of my favorite things as well as like
when I'm giving a talk and someone was

794
00:47:13,461 --> 00:47:15,500
just like nodding cause like yeah,
she gets it.

795
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:17,930
You're nodding the whole time and
it's such a great thing to see that.

796
00:47:17,931 --> 00:47:20,420
So thank you for that.
Yeah, that was awesome.

797
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,370
So who are you guys going
to give your tribute to?

798
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,353
Yes,

799
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:31,660
there you go. What? So that's
my fiance Mickey, by the way,

800
00:47:31,661 --> 00:47:34,810
in the back of the room who gave me
the first tribute and inspired at all.

801
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:37,710
And now she's six months pregnant. We
just got back from the doctor. Okay.

802
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:38,683
Today

803
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:47,970
she's got a few now too.
And obviously I made her my wife.

804
00:47:47,971 --> 00:47:49,950
So it works.

805
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:56,350
We actually just had a beautiful one.
Um,

806
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:00,420
we had a woman who proposed to her
girlfriend. How long was the video, John?

807
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:06,510
Yeah, an hour long. And you know,
just like some of the stories, again,

808
00:48:06,511 --> 00:48:09,090
it's like I get goosebumps thinking
about it. So like this past week alone,

809
00:48:09,091 --> 00:48:12,450
we had this woman who had an hour long
video to propose to her girlfriend.

810
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:16,620
We had another woman who just submitted
a testimonial and she was crying in her

811
00:48:16,621 --> 00:48:18,330
testimonial video and she said,
I don't,

812
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:20,760
I gave this to my best friend in 55 years.

813
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:25,110
She was diagnosed with lung cancer five
years ago, and, uh, she didn't make it.

814
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:26,390
And,
um,

815
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:30,960
I did this video so that her
granddaughters would know who she was.

816
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:35,040
And the tribute ended up being an
hour and a half. And it's, again,

817
00:48:35,041 --> 00:48:40,041
it's giving this gift of legacy and
gratitude and reminding people who someone

818
00:48:41,011 --> 00:48:45,660
was. So, uh, if there's anyone in your
lives who's really had an impact, um,

819
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:46,920
we'd love to see you guys on the site.

820
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:50,670
Awesome.
Yeah.

821
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:55,430
Thanks guys.
