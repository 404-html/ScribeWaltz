12
00:01:00,871 --> 00:01:01,704
conversation.

13
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,120
So more of a do has that achieved success
in various fields plus as an executive

15
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,470

of big Lawrence and associates,

16
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,490
one of Nigeria's leading outsourcing.

17
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:24,240
Okay.

She ends up in the world of media as the
Creator and hostess of moments with Mo

19
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:34,300
earning the accolade of
Africa's first lady of chats.

20
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,680
The show was the first stuff.

21
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:42,681
It's time to be syndicated across
Africa with an impressive guests.

22
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,930
This that includes Hillary Rodham Clinton,

23
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,180
President Muhammadu Buhari and
Christine Lagarde amongst others.

24
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,440
Three years ago she
launched everybody light TV,

25
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,800
which is Africa's first
global entertainment and
lifestyle network or premium

26
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,450

00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:09,520
And in 2014 she started ebony life films.

prestigious international film
festivals and broke box office records

31
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,690
nationwide.
I think that is

32
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:30,210
well,

33
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:35,210
it is highly sought after
in depth knowledge on the
African and global creative

34
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:36,403
industry.

35
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,420
She has spoken at the University
of Cambridge Judge Business School.

36
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,610
What is school of business?

00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:48,850
How would university and
New York University Stern

recognition by Forbes as the first

39
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:56,960
African woman.

00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:02,140
So lunch of [inaudible] TV as well
as Africa is most successful woman.

41
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,283
Hey,

42
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:08,081
yeah,

43
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:13,081
those have been recognized by CNN as
Africa is Queen of media who conquered the

44
00:03:13,241 --> 00:03:16,570
continental. So once again,
welcome. Thank you for having me.

45
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,820
It's really great to have you
guess which is a whole team

46
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:26,500
switching roles. So, um, a
lot of people have journals,

47
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,400
right?

48
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,400
And a lot of people struggle to make the
jump required to achieve those dreams,

49
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,100
especially when it involves
going into a new space.

50
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:41,050
Now that's something you've done quite a
few times in your career from the early

51
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:45,160
days you left the security
of a upbeat employment.

52
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:49,180
So to set up an HR consultancy firm,
we glorious associates.

53
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,680
Subsequently you started
a talk show moments we mo,

54
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,760
which was new territory for you.

55
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:00,660
What inspired you and give you the
courage to take those initial steps?

56
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:07,430
When I decided to leave as a mobile,

57
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,010
it was a really big
jump for me because yes,

58
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,010
there's nothing like working in oil
and gas in Nigeria. I mean it's a,

59
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:19,430
it's a job for life so to speak,
unless you do and you to doable.

60
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:24,460
But if you just go to work
and do the normal things,
you know, you get paid well,

61
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:24,881
you know,

62
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:29,110
you've got a pension or build a nice house
and everything really if they need to

63
00:04:29,111 --> 00:04:31,120
be just fine.
Um,

64
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:36,310
but I think that as an
entrepreneur or for me, you know,

65
00:04:36,311 --> 00:04:37,210
there's this,
for me,

66
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:42,211
there was this unsettling feeling that
there was certain things that I felt that

67
00:04:42,311 --> 00:04:46,690
I had to do.
And I think when that feeling comes,

68
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,120
it's,
it can be obsessive.

69
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:54,010
It can almost be as if it's an
addiction of some sorts. You know,

70
00:04:54,011 --> 00:04:59,011
you just feel that you have
to do everything within
your power to achieve that

71
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:05,200
particular obsession.
So yes,

72
00:05:05,201 --> 00:05:10,201
I had a great job and the other day it
was actually the birthday of the ta to

73
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,950
the old deal of Exxonmobil.

74
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:16,900
So she had invited me to come and it
was just last Friday and I went along to

75
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:18,160
enter and I saw all that.

76
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,560
They were colleagues there and
I was thinking to myself, wow,

77
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,140
it could have been a
really comfortable life.

78
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,770
But then I decided otherwise.

79
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,740
And the thing is that
when you decide otherwise,

80
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,970
there are no guarantees about
that decision that you have taken.

81
00:05:33,971 --> 00:05:38,080
You don't know how it's gonna turn
out. So at times I'm like, my God,

82
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,780
what about if we had gone wrong?
You know.

83
00:05:40,781 --> 00:05:45,781
But I think sometimes you need to take
those steps because what really happens

84
00:05:45,851 --> 00:05:49,510
if it goes wrong? What is the what?
What is? So for me I'm always like,

85
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,640
what is the possible worst
thing that can happen?

86
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,520
The possible wasn't that can
happen is go to get another job.

87
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,240
So I think once you understand that
you are not afraid of what's the worst

88
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:06,430
outcome can be and you then look at the
positivity of what the upside can be and

89
00:06:07,521 --> 00:06:09,590
then once you are prepared,

90
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,590
I think preparation is important.

91
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,740
You can't just go into wanting to leave
paid employment without having had a

92
00:06:18,021 --> 00:06:23,021
secure plan about what you're going to
do once you have left paid employment.

93
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,980
So before I left,

94
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:29,390
I was kind of like walking on two sides
of the street at the same time. You know,

95
00:06:29,391 --> 00:06:31,930
it had started that Rollins
already working with Exxon Mobil.

96
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,430
You have to declare absolutely everything.

97
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,760
So I declared that I did have an
interest in a consulting firm.

98
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,040
We were doing some business.

99
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:43,100
I did employee some stuff to
look after the business for me.

100
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:46,100
So when I could see that there was,

101
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:50,360
there were many more possibilities and
I can't achieve those possibilities by

102
00:06:50,361 --> 00:06:52,160
staying in a nine to five job,

103
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,430
a then had to decide about resigning.

104
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:59,510
And I was warned about resigning.
I was told that Melissa,

105
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,620
you can go to his project and I've gone
to Houston on sort of three months,

106
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:07,860
you know, I'm sort of out of
station work opportunities, um,

107
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,870
some shorter. So I had all
this opportunities there. Um,

108
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,780
and also there's more you can grow
hair, why you'd buy my, he said, well,

109
00:07:14,781 --> 00:07:18,620
don't leave. And I just said,
I have to leave, you know,

110
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,950
and I just have that
punch knowing that okay,

111
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,780
once I'm out of it as a mobile,

112
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:28,810
I have no alternative now than to do
absolutely everything within my power to

113
00:07:31,641 --> 00:07:35,930
make that transition work.
So I did plenty of notice,

114
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,580
six months notice.
And whilst I was doing that,

115
00:07:38,581 --> 00:07:40,460
it was sort of trying to
build up on the outside,

116
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:45,320
sort of find an office and find stuff
and you know that Vic Lawrence on the

117
00:07:45,321 --> 00:07:50,090
right footing so it can be staring.
You can't just leave.

118
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:54,170
You do have to plan. There are no
guarantees and is going to work,

119
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,950
but I always believe that
you know with a great plan,

120
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:02,450
if you're ready to work hard
and if you put God first,

121
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,950
you know I do believe that you
will get the results that you need.

122
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:10,070
Even of course you're going to be
challenged, you're going to go to many,

123
00:08:10,071 --> 00:08:12,770
many meetings and people
are going to say no to you,

124
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:16,130
but for me each time I hear
no and like I'm one, you know,

125
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:19,940
and one notch closer to a yes because I
totally believe in the law of averages.

126
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,170
Everybody cannot see no.

127
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,580
At some point you're going to get to
that yes is that he has going to help me

128
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:28,250
break even that month and I can be
able to pay my salary is that month.

129
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:31,610
At some point you have to understand
that you can't go into business thinking

130
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:34,340
that you're gonna make a huge profit.
As soon as you set up that business,

131
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,170
that business has to grow.

132
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,470
You're going to have to look at the
fact that you may not be able to take

133
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:42,690
extensive holidays so you not able to do
all the things you could even do whilst

134
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,210
viewer fully employed.

135
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:49,130
What are the sacrifices that you're
ready to make to make that business work?

136
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:51,920
Because sometimes we're not
ready for the sacrifice.

137
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,160
You want to continue living the life that
you lead when you are being paid nine

138
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,710
to five and there was a big company
car and there was this and that was the

139
00:08:58,711 --> 00:08:59,130
other.

140
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:03,000
You may have to just take a step back
to see what those things are that you're

141
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:07,620
going to have to just say, well, I
can't do that for now. You know? So, um,

142
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,320
yeah,
I don't think that to answer the question.

143
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:15,510
Absolutely very, very well. And you
talk, talking about making it work right?

144
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:16,920
With the Florence associates,

145
00:09:16,921 --> 00:09:21,921
that was an area of your expertise
because you were head of Exxon Mobil.

146
00:09:21,951 --> 00:09:22,440
Yes,

147
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,090
that's a part that is a bit more familiar
for a lot of setting up a business and

148
00:09:27,091 --> 00:09:30,540
your area of expertise. But that does
not guarantee success. It doesn't.

149
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,900
So what were the things that you
put in place to make it work?

150
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,810
Well, the first thing I did
was to get a small office. Um,

151
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:42,380
make sure that I employed a few experts
that I could afford at the time. Um,

152
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,610
because one thing I find about going into
entrepreneurship is that sometimes the

153
00:09:45,611 --> 00:09:46,120
people,

154
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,320
the best people that you want your
content really afford them because they're

155
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:52,630
themselves want to become entrepreneurs
and they want to do other things. So,

156
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,021
you know,

157
00:09:53,021 --> 00:09:57,140
you have to sort of calm the markets to
find the best people that you can, um,

158
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,780
and offer them the necessary incentives
for them to come on board as part of

159
00:10:01,781 --> 00:10:05,590
your team. So that was really
important for the being an HR person.

160
00:10:05,591 --> 00:10:09,190
They knew that it was important
to have the right team in place.

161
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,440
So it's about having the right team.
It's about,

162
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,130
it was about having a work environment
and that I thought was attractive enough

163
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,570
for clients to be able to visit.
Um,

164
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:21,470
it was about setting up all those
processes and procedures they can show you

165
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,750
have a phone that's working,

166
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,450
they can show you have letterhead and
the can you have an email address.

167
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:28,770
I mean in those days there was
only high Perrier so I emailed,

168
00:10:28,771 --> 00:10:31,040
nothing was Vic had high period.com.
Um,

169
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,320
it's not like today where you can
sort of, you know, doors. It's,

170
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:36,550
it's incredible how things have changed.
But at one point,

171
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,100
or you could do in their journal to get
an imminent as what you had to go to

172
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,830
high period. Um, so we had Vicky,

173
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:45,870
taper.com set up all the people work
and then you start the cold calling,

174
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,810
you then start to run in your business.

175
00:10:49,811 --> 00:10:52,090
You then start going out
for business meetings.

176
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,140
You then start trying to persuade everyone
to come on board and to do business

177
00:10:56,141 --> 00:10:56,860
with you.

178
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,960
And what I used to say to my team then
was that you can't go in there Dijuan

179
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,040
expecting that they're going
to give you that business.

180
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,450
They're going to have to find it.

181
00:11:04,451 --> 00:11:06,790
There has to be a pure three of which
are going to have to go out there,

182
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:11,170
find out what their needs are and keep
going back and keep going back until at

183
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:14,960
some point you're going to pick up neither
some small small crumbs and then in a

184
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,420
near turn into,
you know,

185
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,610
prove yourself and then they're going
to trust you more and they're going to

186
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:22,720
trust you more. And I think that's
basically what we started doing.

187
00:11:22,721 --> 00:11:27,721
We just made sure when we're just out
there every day covering every possible

188
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:32,710
opportunity that we found, you know,
with all the bands, with all the Telcos,

189
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:37,090
with all the FMCG is with absolutely.
Even in those days even, you know,

190
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:41,710
public sector government work. So we're
just basically just out there, you know,

191
00:11:41,711 --> 00:11:44,070
just sort of reaching out to everyone.
Um,

192
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,280
and what I noticed was that it was
important for me to be the chief marketing

193
00:11:48,281 --> 00:11:51,790
officer of the company.
You can impress someone to do that role,

194
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:56,080
but ultimately lot of it bolted down to
what you were also doing in trying to

195
00:11:56,081 --> 00:11:57,690
make things happen at the same time.
Yeah,

196
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:02,070
yeah, yeah. Very interesting. And I see
your point as well as an entrepreneur,

197
00:12:02,071 --> 00:12:02,970
you're pretty,
you know,

198
00:12:02,971 --> 00:12:07,650
you own the vision and the
chief marketer especially. Yes.

199
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,140
And you've got to get
everyone else to buy in,

200
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:14,330
into that vision and own the vision and
take responsibility for the achievements

201
00:12:14,331 --> 00:12:15,164
of division.

202
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:19,770
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then
you suck up into which was,
and I know before that then

203
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:23,100
there was the protest hotel,
local parks. It was awkward park.

204
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:26,490
So whilst I was busy with the Clarus,

205
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:30,060
what I had found was that there
weren't really any purpose built,

206
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:33,750
treating a conference facilities in
Nigeria would use the Sheraton hotel.

207
00:12:33,751 --> 00:12:34,670
Any character would just,

208
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,280
the equal hotel would even use
a place called city TCC augury,

209
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:42,780
which is outside of Lagos
on the way to Egypt. Um,

210
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,530
and in those days there were no fools.
They don't know falls.

211
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:49,590
I need today the world has changed.
People don't know how lucky they are.

212
00:12:49,591 --> 00:12:53,280
A time setting up the business in the
Nigeria of today versus what it was like

213
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:56,800
back then. You know, so I would
have a teen in TCIS yogurt,

214
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,430
I'll be dialing the number two,
get some new to them.

215
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:04,420
Maybe after a hundred tries I would get
through to some landlines are started

216
00:13:04,421 --> 00:13:06,930
with it's six zero, whatever
it was in those days, you know,

217
00:13:06,931 --> 00:13:11,340
so we did a lot of training there. Um,
so for me the challenge then was, okay,

218
00:13:11,341 --> 00:13:12,870
you're going to focus on
training and development,

219
00:13:12,871 --> 00:13:17,210
but where are the purpose built
centers for this it cover turn.

220
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,670
There could be a wedding going on next
door and you have a training event going

221
00:13:20,671 --> 00:13:24,510
on. People can't concentrate. Pretty much
the same happened at the Sheraton Hotel.

222
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,160
Jesus,
you're what's really far.

223
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:29,910
I started thinking about putting
together a center, you know,

224
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:34,440
started pretty much as just a center that
could, you know, you could sleep there,

225
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,200
you could also have the
training center there. Um,

226
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,290
and then one fine day I was at a cocktail,

227
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,030
which is why it's important
to go out and network.

228
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:46,480
And then I want you to Dick
Kramer, the cleaners, a lovely, um,

229
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,920
old Amanda's been in Nigeria probably
for about 50 years is actually a set of

230
00:13:49,921 --> 00:13:53,460
essential and KPMG and it's been like a
mentor to me over the years. And I said,

231
00:13:53,461 --> 00:13:55,700
Dick, you know, I've got
this project, you know,

232
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:59,510
we really want to start my own sort of
like TCC augury um, and said to me about,

233
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,990
no,
why don't you brand it?

234
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:04,320
Why not get a group like the
Protea hotel involved to brand?

235
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,660
So that now got me off on
another trail of, okay,

236
00:14:06,661 --> 00:14:10,500
let's see if we can get them involved.
And eventually, initially they said no,

237
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:13,680
but sometimes people say, no, you
have to ask, why are they saying no?

238
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,890
So went back again and again and again.
Eventually they said yes,

239
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:21,420
we had done some plans initially we had
to change the plans to the most suitable

240
00:14:21,421 --> 00:14:22,254
to a hotel.

241
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:27,450
The cost of investment of building the
Pulitzer Hotel went off like 10 fold from

242
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:31,170
it. Just being a little nice
little screening center to it.

243
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:34,540
Now having some sort of, you
know, three star standard. Um,

244
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:37,260
of course I was invested in it.
Um,

245
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:42,270
and I found that my investment in terms
of my shareholding was dwindling because

246
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,380
I couldn't afford to take on the
huge investment that it was. I mean,

247
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,490
also the five at the time,

248
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:51,410
the project cost in those days was $10
million and I just wasn't to be able to

249
00:14:51,411 --> 00:14:55,010
do it alone. So I have to say to myself,
do you want to see this become a reality?

250
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,570
Even though you may only,

251
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,650
you may end up owning a smaller share
or do you just want to sit back and say,

252
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:02,810
well,
I'm just in a good and a little center,

253
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:06,260
which may not get all this
branding and this, you know, um,

254
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,680
or do you want others to come
in and be a part of it so that,

255
00:15:08,681 --> 00:15:11,030
that you can be a much bigger dream?
And I said to myself,

256
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:13,520
I'm going to go the route of
letting me get other investors in.

257
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,710
So they've got Uba trustees involved.
Um,

258
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,290
we also got a mid will show
his involvement as the ink.

259
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,400
And that's basically how we got
that project off the ground.

260
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:27,520
So that was my second major project
after having left Exxon mobile.

261
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,440
Um, and then it was a few years
after that. But um, yeah, I dunno.

262
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:37,820
Sometimes I, yeah, the idea is just
calm. And I think that sometimes for me,

263
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:42,380
um, when I'm invited to speak on being
asked, you know, what inspires you,

264
00:15:42,381 --> 00:15:45,060
where do the ideas come from?
I have to just see is God,

265
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:49,640
my son is a little bit basic and it
sounds simple in its sound. Yeah. Right.

266
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:53,380
But that is the truth because what
I find often happens to me is,

267
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:56,780
and I will say this to anyone,
never go to sleep without a notepad,

268
00:15:56,781 --> 00:15:59,390
by your bed and a pen.
Because for me,

269
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:01,280
any idea that I've had is coming
in the middle of the notes,

270
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,580
that Aha moment to just yes. And, and,

271
00:16:04,581 --> 00:16:08,420
and those ideas come and I find
that if I haven't noted it down,

272
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,740
by the time you wake up, you may have
forgotten it. So I find that it's,

273
00:16:12,741 --> 00:16:16,250
the clarity for me is always at some
point in the middle of the night.

274
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:20,990
And I instantly just wake up and then I
just write and write and write and write.

275
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:24,680
And then I transfer that into some
sort of PowerPoint presentation.

276
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,860
And then I needed to go out
there and sell the idea.

277
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,840
So that's happened one night. The
Inspire African dream, just key.

278
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,750
Even the name is my Africa cane.
Um,

279
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,730
the name more with mold
didn't come for a while,

280
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:41,840
but what have you been thinking? What
was it like literally out of the blue?

281
00:16:41,841 --> 00:16:45,760
Because it looks like you're very
good at identifying gaps in your mind.

282
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,153
Hmm.

283
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,070
So was that sort of in the space?
You know,

284
00:16:50,071 --> 00:16:52,320
and we're thinking and then
you've got clarity. Yeah,

285
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:55,850
well it's sort of just like
a light, like a flash. The

286
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:59,410
thing is, you know, the even ends
a little bit in setting up get,

287
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,910
Lawrence was easy because it wasn't easy,

288
00:17:01,911 --> 00:17:04,250
but pretty much it was the same
line of what I'd been used to.

289
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,670
And then sort of during the hotel
project I wasn't going to run the hotel.

290
00:17:07,671 --> 00:17:11,270
So again, I could see that. Okay. And
it was also, there was some sort of,

291
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:16,150
you can see the alignment between and
Mclarens and our servicing. Yes. Um,

292
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,020
the Pulitzer Hotel at the time.

293
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:22,790
So this move in some moments
with Mo when that one came,

294
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:27,800
I was concerned, I was concerned
because you know how you're like,

295
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,840
why are you going to tell? What are
people going to think, you know? Um,

296
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,380
and you know, we live in a society
whereby sometimes, you know,

297
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,480
people get the wrong end of the stick,
you know,

298
00:17:38,481 --> 00:17:41,960
and then we're telling a particular
person about the sound or the person could

299
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:45,170
see if the hair wants to become
a presenter to the presenter.

300
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,270
But for me it was more than that.

301
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:51,330
It was about the fact that we needed to
be able to have a conversation around

302
00:17:51,331 --> 00:17:56,331
the things on the issues that are
important to us as a people within the

303
00:17:57,091 --> 00:18:00,570
continent. And within Nigeria
more specifically. I mean, yes,

304
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,310
I have watched the Oprah Winfrey show. I
have watched the Ellen degeneres. I mean,

305
00:18:05,311 --> 00:18:08,370
I can't do the Ellen thing. I mean,
she's so funny. I like how did she do it?

306
00:18:08,371 --> 00:18:10,920
I don't know. You know, at the time
there was dozens of terror that's shoe.

307
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,710
So there were all these shows.
Well on the end, that platform.

308
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,810
So I went in to have a discussion with
them that um, about the fact that,

309
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,570
you know, when I gathered the courage
and I had done the presentation at,

310
00:18:21,571 --> 00:18:23,940
this is what happens with a lot of
people about the idea of, you know,

311
00:18:23,941 --> 00:18:26,490
went in to do a presentation to them
just to see what they would think.

312
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,600
And the initial response at the time was,
why do we need to show,

313
00:18:30,601 --> 00:18:34,800
we already have a lot of talk shows and
it's incredible how the nude for local

314
00:18:34,801 --> 00:18:38,700
content has changed in
the last 12 to 13 years.

315
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,990
Because then we didn't even have,

316
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,170
we didn't seem to have an
appetite for looking at content.

317
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,530
We didn't seem to crave it.
We did seem to want it.

318
00:18:45,531 --> 00:18:48,270
We don't seem to carry for dentists.
Well, if it didn't even exist.

319
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:53,610
So I kept saying to them, I think there's
been to be a need for sure like this.

320
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,940
And my reasons are that yes,
I am traveling.

321
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:01,380
I can relate to some of the topics and
the things that have been said on those

322
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:03,540
shows. I mean, if I want me to go,

323
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:07,260
if needed that particular day or posts
talking about weight loss and they're

324
00:19:07,261 --> 00:19:10,350
going to be talking about eating asparagus
or carrots or whatever they may be,

325
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:15,030
but how is that relevant to a Nigerian
entity that wants to lose weight,

326
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:17,670
where it should be to
find a struggles we're in?

327
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,930
So for me it was about bringing this
message home and seeing that how do we do

328
00:19:21,931 --> 00:19:26,931
with issues in our environment it's in
that is beating his wife and you know,

329
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,310
she's a victim of domestic abuse.

330
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:34,580
How is that sure in America born to help
her overcome that battle in Nigeria.

331
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:39,390
Meanwhile, there are so many associations
that are dealing with domestic abuse,

332
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:44,280
who you can call out to in Nigeria who
were having no facetime about having that

333
00:19:44,281 --> 00:19:48,450
conversation with people that they can
say, listen, if this is happening to you,

334
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,830
I'm here to help you.
I was a victim now I'm evictor.

335
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,640
There were no opportunities for that.

336
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:58,560
How come we're not celebrating our own
people that were achieving certain things

337
00:19:58,561 --> 00:20:01,380
in the world of fashion and
music and so on and so forth.

338
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,390
Now we have all the blogs,
we have all of that.

339
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,140
We didn't have those things 12 years ago.
All we had the humbler city people,

340
00:20:07,141 --> 00:20:09,470
if he wanted to know what
was happening to x, y, zed,

341
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:16,190
if it's totally comes
alive in the last decade,

342
00:20:16,441 --> 00:20:18,860
it has exploded,
you know?

343
00:20:18,861 --> 00:20:22,620
So it was really about telling them
that there was a need. Then God,

344
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:27,420
eventually Joe Honda, who was then the
mg of Avnet eventually said, okay Mo,

345
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:30,720
I'm going to buy this idea, but
you know what? I can afford it.

346
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:34,140
I don't have money to condition you,
but I will license your show.

347
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:37,350
So he now suggested that
you go to look for sponsors.

348
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,220
I've kind of been in the sponsor's
game prior to starting moments with my,

349
00:20:42,221 --> 00:20:45,510
I didn't have a clue, but I thought, okay,
in England I don't, during the summer,

350
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:49,750
I don't know this sort of sales jobs and
I've been told you can't sell signs to

351
00:20:49,751 --> 00:20:54,550
the tuition, so go out there
and sell. So I went around,

352
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,900
I went to the banks,

353
00:20:55,901 --> 00:21:00,280
I went to the Tel calls to try and sell
moments with more looking at what would

354
00:21:00,281 --> 00:21:05,190
the benefits be, an opening billboards
saying brought to you by Xyz company,

355
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:09,190
adverts in between the show product
placements, maybe if your color is red,

356
00:21:09,191 --> 00:21:11,680
will have read in the background. So I
had to now start thinking about, okay,

357
00:21:11,681 --> 00:21:15,070
what are all those things I'm
going to do to get them to commit?

358
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:19,450
Because you can't just keep saying to
somebody, be a sponsor. What is the value?

359
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,660
What is the value you're
giving to the sponsor?

360
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:25,360
And then it happens to us everyday
people going to sit in, I need a partner,

361
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:28,210
major partner,
how you want the exposure on the channel,

362
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,800
but what are we getting in return?

363
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:33,670
So we need to get value so that we
can give you some value as well.

364
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:38,170
So that's sort of opened up my eyes to
the world of sponsorships and how to

365
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:41,080
close those sort of sponsorship
deals. And um, you know,

366
00:21:41,081 --> 00:21:44,020
had gone to one particular bank at
the time and they were like, Oh yes,

367
00:21:44,021 --> 00:21:46,300
I wanted the Md.
Had said we're going to do it,

368
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:50,410
and then this particular MD and not later
hired a new head of corporate who now

369
00:21:50,411 --> 00:21:53,470
said, we're not going to do it,
and I was totally like devastated,

370
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:57,250
but I thought to myself, am I going
to let that get me down? I said, no,

371
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,330
to pick myself up.

372
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,970
I caught a good friend of mine at the
time called Maca Darcy who runs a swirling

373
00:22:01,971 --> 00:22:05,310
Cavita. I'm consulting, you know
mark? I said, Mark Seniors, your job,

374
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,570
you're not supposed to.
They did. What do I do now?

375
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:11,230
And at the time I was looking for a
huge amount of money to start this show.

376
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,090
He said, look, break it down.

377
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,150
Why don't you just see if we could
even do one season of this show.

378
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:20,620
If you do one season successfully,
then you can start grilling from there.

379
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,840
That advice basically is what happened.

380
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:24,940
It took me a while to
have a meeting with them.

381
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,000
Then the MDL stay back and session,

382
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,740
like in February I did my
usual presentation to him.

383
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,740
I've never met the man in my entire life.
And I walked in there thinking,

384
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:35,770
I wonder what he thinks.
And eventually he said,

385
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:38,170
we're not going to sponsor but we
want to invest in your company.

386
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:43,860
And then they have the SME scheme and
they bought into inspire Africa and that

387
00:22:44,201 --> 00:22:45,820
basically gave us the seed capital.

388
00:22:45,821 --> 00:22:50,760
We needed to go build our own studio
because we had to do the old space when

389
00:22:50,761 --> 00:22:53,260
we're going to have this conversation.
It doesn't exist.

390
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:56,170
It's not like in the space where
you can just walk into a studio,

391
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,010
dry hire the studio and record.
We couldn't do that.

392
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:05,190
So we then have to sort of get our studio
space and with within a city mall and

393
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,630
an empty space,
we sort of did it up as best as we could.

394
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:10,720
And that's what we started doing this
and before the went on a training course.

395
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:17,120
Yes, yes, yes.

396
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,570
Recall hearing you say that you have

397
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,450
never done it before. It was, I'm
going into a new space. Yes, yes.

398
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:31,860
How did you develop your
own capacity and also, um,

399
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:35,560
position yourself in a
way that you and the show?

400
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,410
Well,
before we started,

401
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,190
thank God we had Skype and so they came
on board as an investor and also as a

402
00:23:42,191 --> 00:23:43,840
sponsor.
And Luckily,

403
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:47,240
eventually I was able to persuade
Ntn to come on board as a sponsor.

404
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:51,860
So I have two strong brands that were
associated with the moments with move

405
00:23:51,861 --> 00:23:54,770
brand.
And the very first interview I did,

406
00:23:55,130 --> 00:24:00,130
my goodness was professor want to show
income and I chased and chased till he

407
00:24:00,921 --> 00:24:03,950
said yes because I thought I need
to start the show with a band.

408
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,280
I need to have a really special guest.
And that's,

409
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:11,060
that sort of did the show the
credibility that it needed.

410
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,910
I went on a training course to
learn how to be a presenter.

411
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:18,860
At the time Oprah had launched
her 25 years, you know,

412
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,640
those sort of video DVD boxes.

413
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:25,130
I bought the entire thing I
would watch and watch, um,

414
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,550
running a training consultancy firm.
I've got one of my instructors turn,

415
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,070
you'll see or see me at
the time to train me.

416
00:24:31,071 --> 00:24:35,300
So would train every weekend I'm at
the protein hotel. He would record me,

417
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,640
would play back,
would look at you no more.

418
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,830
You need to improve on
this and improve on that.

419
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,050
So I did all those
things if I got started.

420
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:47,620
So that kind of gave me a little bit
of confidence. I was still very um,

421
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,183
nervous.

422
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:54,730
But I just found that once I got
into the flow of the conversation,

423
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,230
I, once I was researched, it's important
to prepare for your interviews. Um,

424
00:25:00,231 --> 00:25:04,100
so I think a lot of advice to young
girls out there that want to become

425
00:25:04,101 --> 00:25:08,630
presenters, it's not really about how
you look or the shoes you have on. Yes,

426
00:25:08,631 --> 00:25:09,530
that's nice too.

427
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:13,550
But it's really going to be about the
quality of the conversation and the

428
00:25:13,551 --> 00:25:16,940
questions that you're asking and
the topics that you'll select it.

429
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:20,300
Because I found when I launched
notice I was, I kept saying,

430
00:25:20,301 --> 00:25:23,900
we need to have topics that are exciting
and people are gonna want to watch.

431
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:27,340
So one of my episodes was this lady,
um,

432
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:32,770
that said that she was the parent to 11
to seven children that she claimed she

433
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:37,400
had in seven months. So we did
lots of research about, okay,

434
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:39,350
well for the blood test
we interviewed her.

435
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,880
She was a parent at the end of the
return that she wasn't the parent. Um,

436
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:45,500
I had another crazy episode
with a alarm robber.

437
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:49,430
This guy was an ExxonMobil and he
sat and told me and Tyler will,

438
00:25:49,431 --> 00:25:51,980
how we got into it and
how we got out of it. Um,

439
00:25:51,981 --> 00:25:53,780
another crazy episode was the snake,

440
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,830
the snake eating episode actually faces
physically can ground by sneaking it in

441
00:25:57,831 --> 00:25:58,880
Nigeria.
And it's neat.

442
00:25:58,881 --> 00:26:01,970
I'm thinking and the lady
came to the studio with the
sneaker looks like chicken,

443
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,880
I cetera and try this one today.

444
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:08,930
So it was really about finding
those topics that would engage,

445
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:13,220
that would be interesting rather than
just another, you know, domestic abuse.

446
00:26:13,221 --> 00:26:16,660
We covered, of course, we celebrated
lots of people on the shows. Um,

447
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:20,360
I mean I probably did a thousand episodes
before I decided that I wanted to kind

448
00:26:20,361 --> 00:26:25,250
of take a back seat before we sort of
started on this journey of ebony life

449
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:27,650
television still on moments.

450
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:32,980
So you have several moments in the
course of I think it's over 10 years now.

451
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:36,170
Yes, yes, yes. 2016 yes.

452
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,410
So in 2006 to 2016, 10 years. Yeah.

453
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:44,280
From the discussions whether
personal lessons that you've learned

454
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,770
that really had a profound impact.

455
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:52,830
The thing is when people that
you don't know open up to you,

456
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:58,230
they literally be, you find yourself in
a situation whereby you think you really,

457
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,160
I mean, that's sharing things within
that she may otherwise not have known.

458
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,380
And one of the episodes that I did for
me that was very early on in my career

459
00:27:07,381 --> 00:27:12,381
that I found really touching was when
that plane crashed in for support and it

460
00:27:13,171 --> 00:27:17,280
had all those children from the, um,
the school dinner, which own the flight.

461
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,150
And I had Mrs and McCree
who lost her only daughter

462
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:23,510
that [inaudible]

463
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,070
the studio and it was sitting
next to a woman that has,

464
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,800
she not only does she come on the show,

465
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:36,160
but she was able to share her pain and
you know how she dealt with the fund that

466
00:27:36,561 --> 00:27:40,530
her only child has been
killed in a plane crash.

467
00:27:40,531 --> 00:27:45,531
And you find that those intimate moments
are just moments where you're like,

468
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,580
you can never just get
them back and you know,

469
00:27:49,581 --> 00:27:51,980
people are sharing things
with you that are really,

470
00:27:51,981 --> 00:27:56,981
really private and you're the custodian
of that inflammation and how you treat

471
00:27:56,991 --> 00:28:01,120
it and how you treat
them. I found to be, um,

472
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:05,330
I had to find my own way of dealing
with those kinds of issues and he would

473
00:28:05,331 --> 00:28:08,030
leave a show at times and you're
like, oh my God. And you then,

474
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:12,350
and I used to do like four shows a
day because the world of production,

475
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,190
that's the only way can make financial
sense or can, we didn't want it to,

476
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,370
you use the cooler to use your,

477
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:23,750
they'd still be recording. So, um,

478
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,480
so at times you'd have to go from doing
a very happy episode to doing a very sad

479
00:28:28,481 --> 00:28:33,481
episode to doing a different sort of
episode and how to your head is kind of,

480
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:34,010
yeah,

481
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:37,940
like in different places and I'm coming
from a world where I haven't done this

482
00:28:37,941 --> 00:28:42,530
before. So having to deal
with all of that was kind of,

483
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,710
yeah. Challenge had its challenges. Yeah.

484
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:47,940
Yeah. And it sounds like
it was a lot of hard work.

485
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:48,953
It's wrong

486
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,310
what you see on an
entrepreneurial success story.

487
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:54,240
It's very easy to
celebrate it and to think,

488
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:56,780
told him why am etc. But
there's a lot of hardware,

489
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:59,860
genuine hardware that goes into
making anything successful.

490
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,160
Very much so. A lot, a lot of hard work.

491
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:05,660
You've got to be worried with searched
on whoever the guest is and if anyone

492
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:07,800
asked in Professor Alicia, and I
thought, you know what? He's like,

493
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,860
you can't fit on the set with, you might
not know what you're talking about.

494
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,440
So I was petrified of that particular one.

495
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:15,760
I must have read and read
and read more than you know,

496
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,400
then I would meet for the interview.

497
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:21,290
But you just have to be prepared for
every single interview that I did.

498
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,490
I had to do our research,

499
00:29:22,491 --> 00:29:25,580
I have to have my questions
with me and sometimes you know,

500
00:29:25,581 --> 00:29:28,460
the response you get has no
link to the next question.

501
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:32,300
So you have to be very quick on your feet
about how you're now going to sort of

502
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:36,060
go back to them and get the necessary
answers that you wanted. Um,

503
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,750
and at times we're going to
have technical problems on set.

504
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,180
Something isn't working.
The generator has Brooklyn.

505
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:44,920
You're like dealing in an environment
whereby your counterparts in another

506
00:29:44,921 --> 00:29:46,510
country doesn't have to
think about these issues.

507
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:50,320
Nobody cares who cares about Palo,
who cares about some of those things here.

508
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:53,050
But here you are dealing
with those realities.

509
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:55,810
Those are my reality is everyday
that I have to deal with.

510
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,300
Find a space when I could
convert into a studio,

511
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:03,220
find stuff that would
understand the vision that
could get me the look and feel.

512
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,340
Because at the time,
as easy as it is,

513
00:30:06,341 --> 00:30:08,530
I mean now that we do a
thousand hours of programming,

514
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:11,560
it talks show is the
easiest format in the world,

515
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:16,420
but no one has to been able to replicate
the moments with Newforma in 10 years

516
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:21,520
and not seen in other talk show that has
replicated the look and feel of talk.

517
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:25,900
And for us talking to the simplest
thing for us on Ebony Life TV today,

518
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:29,770
we've taken talk to it. It's completely
different level from things like moments.

519
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,270
Um,
now we have women's Z,

520
00:30:31,271 --> 00:30:35,050
which is with a much younger crop of
young girls who are having a conversation.

521
00:30:35,051 --> 00:30:37,600
One of the things that are important
to them. We have love lounge,

522
00:30:37,601 --> 00:30:39,340
which is about love,
sex and relationships.

523
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,180
We've got men's corn and just talk about
things that men are fascinated about.

524
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:46,210
You know, that women also wants to
know about them. Um, we have the broad,

525
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:48,820
which is doing well or doing his
own crazy thing. It's all talk.

526
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:53,340
So we've taken the talk and
we've kind of given it a twist.

527
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,650
So it's, um, it is a lot of
work. It is a lot of work.

528
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:01,180
Even convincing sponsors to come on
board after you convince them, oh yeah,

529
00:31:01,181 --> 00:31:04,520
pay me. You're going to be chasing
them around today. Payment. No,

530
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:07,130
you have salaries to pay.
You have cool young anybody else to be,

531
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,770
they're not going to wait
for clients to pay you.

532
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,530
You're talking to the bank and you know,
facilitating overdrafts,

533
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:15,190
say when they get, didn't all kinds of
things just to keep the business going.

534
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,090
Yeah.

535
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:17,730
Yeah.
So talking about everything life too.

536
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:21,110
That's one of your more
recent home groups. Yes.

537
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,930
And I remember the timeline,

538
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:28,590
oh, about Africa is about to
change forever. Forever. Yes.

539
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:32,920
You share the vision behind that.
The vision behind that was that,

540
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:37,960
I remember a few years before then I'd
interviewed Hillary Clinton and one of

541
00:31:37,961 --> 00:31:40,090
the key questions that I said to her was,

542
00:31:40,091 --> 00:31:44,890
how do we change the stereotypes about
how we are perceived across the world?

543
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,510
And she said to me,

544
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:51,820
we have to have people like you speaking
on behalf of Africa and putting a

545
00:31:51,821 --> 00:31:56,560
different image out there about the
continent. Because even with Google,

546
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:00,070
if you Google Africa, what are
the first than in does it come up?

547
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:04,240
Is going to be poverty, it's going to
be this, it's going to be destruction.

548
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:08,830
It's going to be all of these images that
the world view have of our continent.

549
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:13,810
How do we change that world view?
It's by creating the reality.

550
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:18,010
That's the other reality
that the world needs to see.

551
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:22,390
And that other reality is showing that
the people like him and I in Nigeria

552
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:26,830
showing up as this audience here
showing that we have, we are capable.

553
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:29,770
And that was how we
came up with a tagline.

554
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:34,360
Every think you think you know about
Africa is going to change because we put a

555
00:32:34,361 --> 00:32:37,660
positive spin on everything.
We didn't create these people.

556
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,500
These people already existed,

557
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:42,320
just didn't have a platform through
which you could engage with them.

558
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:46,160
So he gave that platform for
engagement from let's make comedy.

559
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:49,730
That's nick reality. Let's make talk.
Let's make speech at programming.

560
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,670
That's to lifestyle.
Let's,

561
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:56,900
let's do everything that we can to show
the world that this, we have a tiger.

562
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:58,580
You know, we have the stamp
that we put on everything,

563
00:32:58,581 --> 00:33:02,780
say ebony life TV made
in Nigeria for the world.

564
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:07,130
So good things can come out of our
constant and out of our country and can be

565
00:33:07,131 --> 00:33:11,330
exported. And, and, and that really
was what it was all about. I mean,

566
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:15,470
we go out to international
exhibitions, um, and people ask us,

567
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,420
I don't know if it's a compliment
or an insult, they said,

568
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:21,140
what's this really needy Nigeria? Yes,
it was made in Nigeria. How about that?

569
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:25,430
I guess we can make things like that
because they're so used to just all kinds

570
00:33:25,431 --> 00:33:28,190
and we have to be careful
about what we put out there.

571
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:30,370
And, uh, actually interestingly,

572
00:33:30,371 --> 00:33:33,550
that's one of our priorities
as Google in Nigeria.

573
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:37,890
Just encouraging having local contents.
Yes,

574
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:39,810
yes,

575
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:42,510
yes, yes, yes, yes.

576
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:46,290
Let me look at this conversation
we're having today. I mean, it is,

577
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,270
you're having it, so thank you. Yeah.

578
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:51,380
Challenges that you
encountered in trying to set,

579
00:33:51,381 --> 00:33:55,810
because that's a really big fits right
in setting up your own TV channel.

580
00:33:56,230 --> 00:34:00,560
Um, everything you've
mentioned, parts of that.

581
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:04,330
I know that there were very challenging,
but this I think was the,

582
00:34:04,331 --> 00:34:05,200
in order of magnitude.

583
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:06,723
Yeah.

584
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:11,570
What are the challenges that you
went through in setting and money?

585
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:16,790
Setting up and running everything
like TV and what support systems and

586
00:34:16,791 --> 00:34:18,580
opportunities are.
Okay.

587
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:24,030
I wake up one day and I decided that I
wanted to launch a TV channel and um,

588
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,770
I had no idea how I was getting to do it,

589
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:31,150
but I just knew that deep down in my
spirit to deep down in my soul, God said,

590
00:34:31,151 --> 00:34:33,560
moe, go and do this. It's scary.

591
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:39,070
Very scary. Very. And I think
sometimes hysteria the dream,

592
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:43,360
the more you need to pursue it because
I think there's a message in there

593
00:34:43,361 --> 00:34:48,100
somewhere. Cause if it's not
scary, then was the challenge.
And I'm funny, I'm like,

594
00:34:48,101 --> 00:34:51,040
okay, oh you have to do is try. If
it doesn't work, it doesn't work.

595
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:55,900
So the idea came and one of the
festival I called was my mom.

596
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,310
My mom is always, she's
my prayer partner. Um,

597
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:03,570
and she said she's my number one fan.
So I said, Mommy, I'm doing this thing.

598
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,140
My worry. I drank, I drank low,

599
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:09,190
has she always says that
she's paying about it.

600
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:12,370
So the next lesson I took was a
friend of mine in South Africa,

601
00:35:12,371 --> 00:35:16,770
Sandra [inaudible], Sandra's one of our
producers. Then on moments, cause let me,

602
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:20,530
didn't want us just to have a Pan African
spin to a lot of our shoes and she

603
00:35:20,531 --> 00:35:24,460
would go around Africa sort of shooting
similar stories for the show at the time.

604
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:28,620
So I said to Sandra, started to reach
and, and sound was like, oh, I know.

605
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:33,580
Sounds really cool and um, what
do we do now? Um, so I thought,

606
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:36,700
how did you start to challenge,
you know, I couldn't get a license.

607
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:40,590
There was opportunity to get a license for
free to edit, all been taken, all gone.

608
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,280
Um,

609
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,510
but I also felt that it was important to
create a platform that could travel and

610
00:35:45,511 --> 00:35:48,930
one could use technology to drive and
we'd be Pan African at the same time.

611
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:54,150
So I had a show on the STV as a,
let me have a conversation with DSTV.

612
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:57,390
So Joe Honda than had approved
the initial aneurysm. I said, Joe,

613
00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:00,540
I want to start a TV channel. And
it's like, well no, have, you know,

614
00:36:00,541 --> 00:36:02,670
they don't just do channels like that,
you know,

615
00:36:02,671 --> 00:36:05,790
I'm not sure we need another channel
but you can try it. So I said,

616
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:09,360
who do I contact? And as it needs to
contact political Alexa Albert's as I can.

617
00:36:09,361 --> 00:36:13,230
I have an email address. So he gave me
her email and this is how it starts.

618
00:36:13,231 --> 00:36:17,580
I didn't know her from Adam sent her
an email and eventually she responded.

619
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:22,530
She sent me a form that's longer than
anything else. Hundreds, not hundreds,

620
00:36:22,531 --> 00:36:26,130
but several pages of what is the
name of the channel? What is the con?

621
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:30,480
I mean questions that I did not even
know because it made me think about, wow,

622
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:32,060
you want to start a channel?

623
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:35,880
What did you know you're going to have
to know this much before you can actually

624
00:36:35,881 --> 00:36:40,050
start the channel of the schedule, the
types of programs, you know, the budget.

625
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,690
I mean,
there was so many questions.

626
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:47,820
Eventually I did the best I could to
answer the questions and I sent the form

627
00:36:47,821 --> 00:36:48,654
back to her.

628
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:52,320
And then I kept chasing her and chasing
her and she wasn't answering me because

629
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:56,220
I didn't, they get requests
at least 10 to 23 d from,

630
00:36:56,221 --> 00:37:00,300
you don't want to set up to the
channels from Nigeria. So, um,

631
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:01,560
eventually I said,

632
00:37:01,561 --> 00:37:04,670
I'm going to be in South Africa because
I was shooting an episode of [inaudible]

633
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,960
and could I please come in and see you?

634
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:11,190
So that was my hope of getting in the
door. So I went in and had a meeting.

635
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,690
So before having the meeting,

636
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:17,750
I then hired someone that was already in
the world of media to do me a beautiful

637
00:37:17,911 --> 00:37:20,820
presentation around this as a sort
of content would have on the channel.

638
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:24,600
Went in and did the presentation and
left the meeting. They said, well,

639
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,850
this doesn't, this isn't quite, it's,

640
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:30,780
I was devastated because I actually paid
someone quite a large sum of money to

641
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:34,020
do that presentation. Um, it
wasn't working so they were like,

642
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:38,520
if you want this channel, you
have to go back and do x, y,

643
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:39,600
zed,

644
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:44,600
and we had workshop after workshop after
workshop deciding on who was going to

645
00:37:45,151 --> 00:37:48,990
be our key Dev. Who Do you really
want to speak to across the continent?

646
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:53,880
What is the conversation? What other
John [inaudible], what are the hours?

647
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:57,390
How are you going to produce these hours?
Who is going to produce these hours?

648
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,010
Who is going to do your post production?

649
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:00,600
How are you going to clear
things through legal?

650
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:05,460
I mean there is a battle and in half of
things you need to play to create one

651
00:38:05,461 --> 00:38:06,660
hour of content.

652
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,960
So eventually after several
months of now having gone back,

653
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:16,440
having left them and gone back to do
another presentation with all of this,

654
00:38:16,441 --> 00:38:19,480
if I had to engage a consultant,
Axonify,

655
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:23,520
then one in Nigeria to do it
because the skill sets don't exist.

656
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:27,750
I found someone in South Africa again
had to invest a huge amount of money that

657
00:38:27,751 --> 00:38:30,630
could have gone into maybe
an ice bag on a holiday.

658
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:34,980
Let's just get this presentation down,
letting us do the strategy session.

659
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:39,340
After which we then did the presentation
without once back into mortgage choice

660
00:38:39,341 --> 00:38:44,320
to present. Then they bought the
idea, but now they gave us conditions.

661
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:49,270
This is a beautiful presentation,
but you need to raise x, y,

662
00:38:49,271 --> 00:38:50,350
zed amounts of money.

663
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:55,680
You need to have his studio before
you can do all of this. So you know,

664
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,240
which is why I said sometimes you
need to pray harder, work hard.

665
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,460
At the same time,
a good friend of mine,

666
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:06,160
I had to raise the money and the story
about how that reads is what I'd like to

667
00:39:06,161 --> 00:39:10,240
share. At the same time, all this
is happening. A good friend of mine,

668
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,920
[inaudible] says to me, you need to go to
cross river and interview the governor.

669
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,250
And I was like,
I'm kind of his money for my channel.

670
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:20,370
I'm trying to do all these things.
I don't really know.

671
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:24,010
But eventually she persuaded me and I
also had wanted to do that into for the

672
00:39:24,011 --> 00:39:24,844
longest time.

673
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:29,020
I got on a plane on new years day,

674
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,330
about five years ago,

675
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:36,870
went to caliber to go and
do this interview with His
Excellency than at the time

676
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,720
governor really murky and
his wife are the at the time.

677
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:46,160
But at the same time I had a sponsor for
my show moments with Mo and the support.

678
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:50,110
So had threatened to pull out unless I
started having a presence on social media

679
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:52,700
cause I wasn't switching. I was,
I didn't know anything about,

680
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:54,280
I was just doing my thing.

681
00:39:55,570 --> 00:40:00,310
I've got a PR person
registered me on Twitter, do
my Facebook and do all of that.

682
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:04,960
So when I got to caliber that evening,
I sent a message saying happy new year,

683
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:09,790
lots of law, firm caliber. And someone
said to me, what's happening in turnover?

684
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,160
I've never been entered in
that point in my entire life.

685
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,670
So I was with a friend in the car
who said, let me take you there.

686
00:40:15,671 --> 00:40:19,450
Let's drive around. We went
there, beautiful place,

687
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:23,980
beautiful but empty as
nothing was into Napa.

688
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:28,300
So the next day when I was going
to interview the governor, um,

689
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:33,250
then in Zion ob who was a
special assistant said come
in and have a conversation

690
00:40:33,251 --> 00:40:36,550
with his. That's the lesser,
before you start your
interview. I did never, nothing,

691
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:39,520
I didn't know what to say to him.
The first thing I said was you accidents.

692
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:42,700
We wanted to not pay as well.
He's Very Mc. What's going on.

693
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,860
That is how that conversation started.

694
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,770
That is how they got the supports
would be needed for the channel.

695
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,720
Now I didn't know,

696
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:53,710
I mean on one hand you are looking
to set up a channel and another hand,

697
00:40:53,711 --> 00:40:55,840
a friend is saying come
and interview the governor.

698
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,210
You have a sponsor saying
you need to start to meeting.

699
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,650
You put all of that together,

700
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:03,640
you send a tweet message
out and Bob's your uncle.

701
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,540
Somehow a couple of years later,
about 18 months later,

702
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:09,460
Cross River state came
on board as our partner.

703
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:13,560
We promised to use that to another studio,
um,

704
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,580
as our destination point for media.

705
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:20,290
And that was the catalyst for getting
ebony life TV started and they also

706
00:41:20,291 --> 00:41:23,170
supported us.
Have the fundraising for Ebony Life TV.

707
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:25,300
So at times without putting
all those elements together.

708
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:28,570
So when people say to you, what is
your recipe? I can't say to you,

709
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,320
don't tweet or don't go to
[inaudible] with the governor.

710
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:37,190
You're going to have to just work hard
enough from the universe to conspire to

711
00:41:37,191 --> 00:41:39,620
say, okay, I am going
to give you your break.

712
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:42,320
I believe that there are dream
makers for all of us out there.

713
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,420
We won't have to meet our dream
makers. And on the other hand, yeah,

714
00:41:45,421 --> 00:41:48,440
you are dream killers. Those are just
the kind of way to kill the dream.

715
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,420
So you have to balance,
you know,

716
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:53,630
the dream killers and the teenagers makers
and see how you get out of that cycle.

717
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:54,700
Yeah.

718
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:58,500
That's lesson I hear as well from just
this thing to use is also having your

719
00:41:58,501 --> 00:41:59,270
reader on.

720
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:03,140
Sometimes you think it's going nowhere
and sometimes for the hell of it,

721
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,410
just go along with whatever it is
because you never know where it's going.

722
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:09,980
Lead to never ever know. It could be
one night you're out having a drink.

723
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,420
You could be in a supermarket,

724
00:42:11,421 --> 00:42:15,050
you could be absolutely anywhere
when the opportunity comes to you.

725
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:18,100
Yeah. Yeah. Another thing
I think is very good at,

726
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:19,690
and I think that's really critical,

727
00:42:19,691 --> 00:42:22,690
negative inertia is
finding the right talents.

728
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:27,520
Whether you saw Stalins and whatever
seems to be helpful because when I think

729
00:42:27,521 --> 00:42:31,100
about ebony life TV and everything
you do actually, you have a great day.

730
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:35,800
We have a fantastic team. How
do you find them? Um, again,

731
00:42:35,801 --> 00:42:38,260
I think the universe will conspire
to sort of be the right people,

732
00:42:38,261 --> 00:42:43,261
but I think maybe being a hatred person
I think also has helped a great deal in

733
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:47,850
understanding what the processes are
that you need to go through to find the

734
00:42:47,851 --> 00:42:51,030
right talent. You know, I can't
work with anyone on my team,

735
00:42:51,031 --> 00:42:54,030
but he's not ready to be playing
email at three o'clock in the morning.

736
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:58,350
I know it sounds crazy, but you
know, you must be able to work hard.

737
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:02,400
You've got to be able to identify
where they're coming from,

738
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:03,680
the things they've done.
I mean,

739
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:06,340
there's someone here with me
to do is with me today. Um,

740
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:11,540
and Eunice was based in America and I
have to plead with her to come back to

741
00:43:11,971 --> 00:43:16,890
Nigeria to work with us because even
before she joined us as a member of our

742
00:43:16,891 --> 00:43:20,640
team, as a head of strategy,
we had already started
working together on little,

743
00:43:20,641 --> 00:43:24,510
little things, not officially, like
it was going to go to the states.

744
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:29,370
She would even proactively volunteer
should proactively help me do things

745
00:43:29,371 --> 00:43:31,380
without me even asking.
And I'm thinking,

746
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:36,410
this is the sort of person you want on
your team to be there for you in your own

747
00:43:36,601 --> 00:43:40,750
corner. Um, and so eventually I
pleaded and said, please come back.

748
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:45,490
And she packed up her bags and she's
come back to Nigeria. Um, you know,

749
00:43:45,491 --> 00:43:49,900
so for me it's really about just putting
your feelers out there and you need to

750
00:43:49,901 --> 00:43:53,230
have that fifth sense.
You need to be able to say to yourself,

751
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:56,230
is this person going to be
a part of your team? And He,

752
00:43:56,231 --> 00:44:00,250
you can pretty much sauce are people
that work hard and people that are just

753
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:04,060
[inaudible]. I'm sorry to
say that, you know, I mean,

754
00:44:04,061 --> 00:44:04,894
there are lot of people that just,

755
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,920
they're all talk and they're just not
going to do the work and I can't deal with

756
00:44:08,921 --> 00:44:12,090
that, you know? So it
needed me. I would attend.

757
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:14,770
You're going to make recruitment
errors and when you do,

758
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,400
you said thank you very much, but it's
not going to work out. Bye Bye. You know,

759
00:44:18,401 --> 00:44:19,780
and then you move on to the next person.

760
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:22,780
And that's pretty much
how I built the team. Um,

761
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:26,890
but I think more than anything it's
really just about finding people that can

762
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:27,923
come plug in.

763
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:31,380
And we have a lot of young people with
us and they want a car ahead of social

764
00:44:31,381 --> 00:44:34,650
media. Let's say she joined us, I don't
know, three, four years ago. And you know,

765
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:38,870
it's incredible how she has
grown into her job, you know?

766
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:43,590
And it's really just about finding the
right team of people and then sharing the

767
00:44:43,591 --> 00:44:48,591
dream and then just being conscientious
about the things that they need to do.

768
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,210
And you're not having to see it a
million times before they do it and

769
00:44:54,211 --> 00:44:58,710
micromanage them. You know,
for them to practice. What
about this, what about that?

770
00:44:58,830 --> 00:44:59,191
You know,

771
00:44:59,191 --> 00:45:02,700
and we're all learning together and I
like to have lots of people around me that

772
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:06,090
even know more than I do about certain
things because you don't know it all.

773
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:08,970
I don't know if my daughter is
working with ebony life now.

774
00:45:08,971 --> 00:45:12,210
She's got some crazy ideas.
She's like, mom, we need to
do this. And I'm like, okay,

775
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:16,020
we're targeting your age. Okay,
I will listen to. So it doesn't,

776
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:20,430
for me it's about making sure we
have an inclusive team that you know,

777
00:45:20,431 --> 00:45:23,190
they can tell us about things that they
think are going to work for the channel

778
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:26,910
of whatever business it is. And we
just fly with, with those ideas.

779
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:31,730
And because we're small for us, we're
able to just get things done very quickly.

780
00:45:31,731 --> 00:45:34,500
We don't have to get to 10 levels
of approval before we do them in.

781
00:45:34,501 --> 00:45:36,480
Be like you guys, I mean Google
it, there's going to be such a,

782
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:39,870
such a massive organization, um, but
with also can pretty much say, okay,

783
00:45:39,871 --> 00:45:43,560
we're going to run with this so we can
execute things really quickly as a small

784
00:45:43,561 --> 00:45:44,394
organization.

785
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:45,713
Awesome.

786
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:51,510
Questions from the audience,
but I'll ask one more question.

787
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,180
What keeps you in a joy?

788
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:58,640
Okay.

789
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:03,520
I think the, for me, the
highlights of my existence,

790
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,360
my children, you know, um,

791
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:10,790
I think that for me they are the
most important thing in my life.

792
00:46:10,791 --> 00:46:13,610
If I had to give everything
I have for my kids,

793
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:17,990
I will do so tomorrows and really,
and I say that 100%. I would,

794
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:22,760
um, my mom is my, you know,
she's my everything, my sisters.

795
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:26,570
Um, I put God before
everything. I absolutely do.

796
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:29,990
I just think it's so important for
me to have that sense of direction.

797
00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:31,490
And you know,

798
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:35,240
what I find interesting is that people
don't often know your relationship with

799
00:46:35,241 --> 00:46:40,130
God and the neck assumptions about
how you've achieved certain things.

800
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:41,750
They don't even know how
you've achieved them.

801
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:46,130
And what I find interesting is that,
that is my secret. I shadowed a lot,

802
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:49,810
but I think sometimes they're not
listening to the fact that if you put him

803
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:53,300
first, if you listen to
him TV, it doesn't matter.

804
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:56,020
I've got this thing six inches
on. I've got my lashes, the web,

805
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:59,150
you in my moments when I'm
on my knees praying to him,

806
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:03,290
it is between him and I
having that conversation and
he's saying, more do this.

807
00:47:03,291 --> 00:47:06,850
This is the most important thing for
you to do. So he guides my every,

808
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:11,810
every move that I do and he just gives me
the confidence to go out there and say,

809
00:47:11,811 --> 00:47:16,811
there's nothing that is really too much
that we can't achieve because with him,

810
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,750
you know that all things absolutely
possible and that that's,

811
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:22,130
that's what I continue to believe him.

812
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:23,100
Yeah.

813
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:28,100
So I'm going to pause my and see if there
are any questions for our very lovely,

814
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:30,733
yeah.

815
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:38,350
I think for me,

816
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:42,520
the schools that I started with most
Appleby my people skills because I'm so

817
00:47:42,521 --> 00:47:45,730
impatient to get things done at times
that I'm sure I'm driving everybody around

818
00:47:45,731 --> 00:47:50,020
me crazy because I kind of like wanted
to happen now because at times I'm like,

819
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:50,870
I might probe manage,

820
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:54,730
I would do it to myself if you can't give
it to me now I'm that kind of person.

821
00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:57,430
Um,
what I think that as we grow,

822
00:47:57,490 --> 00:48:02,440
I think skills are something
that with age you get better,

823
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:07,500
you'll get better at them because I know
I'm a much better person now than I was

824
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:11,320
10 years ago, 20 years ago.
So I think it's gradual. Um,

825
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:15,190
and I think it's also important to keep
learning about the skills that you have

826
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:19,210
that you need and to practice.
I find I practiced the skills that I need.

827
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:20,260
You know,

828
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:25,180
even public speaking at times I practice
because I'm not the best public speaker

829
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:26,050
I want to be.

830
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:30,580
And I'm constantly challenged by the fact
that I'm not going to say no to going

831
00:48:30,581 --> 00:48:35,260
out and speaking in public, but I'm going
to learn to be a better public speaker.

832
00:48:35,261 --> 00:48:39,250
So it's really about teaching
yourself those skills that you need.

833
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,860
And I think skills come with habit.

834
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:46,450
Once you practice it enough times
then becomes a reality for you.

835
00:48:46,451 --> 00:48:49,960
So whatever skills that you think you
lacking, just work out them. If it's a,

836
00:48:49,961 --> 00:48:51,820
you're not smiling,
you know what keeps smiling,

837
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:54,910
it's mild enough times you're going to
find yourself just smiling without even

838
00:48:54,911 --> 00:48:57,340
thinking about it because the
mind is a very funny thing.

839
00:48:57,341 --> 00:49:00,100
It just kind of just takes over and
does those things without even thinking

840
00:49:00,101 --> 00:49:00,934
about it.

841
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:12,720
From my own personal experience,
it's, it's pretty, from my experience,

842
00:49:12,721 --> 00:49:16,440
it's pretty much been about the fact that
you need to share the dream. You know,

843
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,740
if you have a big dream,
you can't do the dream by yourself.

844
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:23,400
You're going to have to look for other
people that you can invite him to make

845
00:49:23,401 --> 00:49:25,180
the dream a reality.
Um,

846
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:29,100
when I was setting a lot of the chlorine's
I didn't need support because it was,

847
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:32,640
I started very small, but when I
moved on to do the [inaudible] hotel,

848
00:49:32,641 --> 00:49:35,250
Oakwood Park, it was a $10
million. I don't have $10 million.

849
00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:40,480
I had to now go out there and do
a proper placement, informal, um,

850
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:44,130
you know, and get people to buy
into the project and it takes time.

851
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:46,620
You're not going to say to someone come
and invested in and I've got to just

852
00:49:46,621 --> 00:49:49,620
sign the check tomorrow. No. Some will say
yes, some will say no. So there was it,

853
00:49:49,621 --> 00:49:51,210
there's a,
there was a process of engagement.

854
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:54,180
It's pretty much the same thing happened
with moments with Mo had to go out

855
00:49:54,181 --> 00:49:57,690
there, as I said earlier and engage
and get people to buy into the dream.

856
00:49:57,930 --> 00:49:59,640
Ebony Life TV was the same thing.

857
00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:02,610
I didn't have the required
capital to set up a TV channel,

858
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:07,650
so I had to find a partner. And those
dreams can sometimes take time, you know,

859
00:50:07,651 --> 00:50:11,790
to, to become a reality because
cash is king and you need the cash.

860
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:15,780
But you just have to just keep watch
dear focus that you want to achieve this.

861
00:50:15,781 --> 00:50:19,770
When those things will come
into the plea in that, you know,

862
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:22,350
and I said with moments of
when I started with one season,

863
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:26,190
but initially my whole idea was I was
looking for money to get me comfortable

864
00:50:26,191 --> 00:50:28,610
for a year. I want, I couldn't
find one or three year,

865
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:31,940
I decided to take Max advice
and just do one season.

866
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:36,530
So if you can find ways to start small,
then you start small.

867
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:40,010
And then once people can see success back.

868
00:50:40,011 --> 00:50:44,130
Now everybody in agile wants to do a
film after the success of the parts.

869
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:46,970
And they're like, can we come up our
time with you? Do you want money?

870
00:50:46,971 --> 00:50:51,830
People are offering us money to partner,
you know, so success has its own,

871
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:55,250
you know, successes. And then others
will come and say, can you come and be,

872
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:56,900
you know,
the parts of your own success.

873
00:50:57,080 --> 00:51:01,790
So once you can achieve some
level of success, then you
just have to just invite,

874
00:51:01,791 --> 00:51:06,200
but never be afraid of inviting people
in to share in your dream. I mean,

875
00:51:06,201 --> 00:51:08,390
you've got to be careful,
do your due diligence and all of that,

876
00:51:08,391 --> 00:51:10,880
but all things being equal,
nobody.

877
00:51:10,881 --> 00:51:13,430
I don't think there's anyone that owes
anything a hundred percent anymore.

878
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:15,603
It doesn't happen

879
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:25,160
if that,
that is a tough one because you know,

880
00:51:25,161 --> 00:51:30,110
there are some women that decide that
when it's time to raise the kids, I'm out.

881
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,330
I'm just going to focus
on raising my children.

882
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:36,140
And then there are some people like
me who are a little bit more selfish,

883
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:38,270
who believe that they can have everything.

884
00:51:38,271 --> 00:51:42,980
So you need to be single minded about
the five that I love my children,

885
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,170
but at the same time I have this dream,

886
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,960
so how am I going to be able
to juggle all of those things?

887
00:51:47,961 --> 00:51:50,150
You need to have a great
support system around you.

888
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:54,140
You need to spend quality time with
your children because I find a lot of

889
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:57,710
housewives that called themselves
housewives. They're not even at home.

890
00:51:57,711 --> 00:52:01,440
Half the time they're probably out having
lunch or doing the nails or some way.

891
00:52:01,441 --> 00:52:04,870
So they have deceived themselves.
That's the of it.

892
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:09,230
So in that regard you
that you are working,

893
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:13,500
you therefore make it. It became part of
my day to sit, I'm going to spend x, Y,

894
00:52:13,501 --> 00:52:15,920
z amount of time with my
children. I'm gonna, you know,

895
00:52:15,921 --> 00:52:17,870
we're going to go out on this day,
we're going to take this holiday,

896
00:52:17,871 --> 00:52:18,740
we're going to do those things.

897
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,770
And when it's really tasteful
need to take myself out of work,

898
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:25,610
a hundred percent equity. My son was going
to go to his a levels and I daughter,

899
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:28,760
I had to physically take the time out
and say, I'm not working for a month.

900
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:30,350
I'm going to go.
We're going to have to search for,

901
00:52:30,351 --> 00:52:33,390
we even do a levels in England and that
was it. And you close down, shop on,

902
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:37,430
you come back to do those things.
So it's really about prioritizing.

903
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:42,170
And I think what happens with working
mothers is that I think your kids become

904
00:52:42,171 --> 00:52:44,330
strong.
I hope so.

905
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:47,930
Mine have might have
that they become strong.

906
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:50,330
Knowing that my mom is working.

907
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:54,560
You're also a role model to your daughter
that she's going to know that her mom

908
00:52:54,561 --> 00:52:59,270
has worked your son. My mom has worked
hard so that when he marries his wife,

909
00:52:59,271 --> 00:53:01,820
he's not going to say sits at home
because it's seen, it's one of us working.

910
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:06,910
So I think we're also preparing our
kids for the fact that it's okay to have

911
00:53:07,071 --> 00:53:09,620
your dreams are valid to burrows.

912
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:13,220
Please don't be limited the suits for
plagiarism here, your dreams are valid.

913
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:17,450
You can take that on to know that you
can go out there and achieve your dreams

914
00:53:17,451 --> 00:53:20,300
the same way that your husband
is achieving his dreams. Right?

915
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,880
So why can't you achieve
yours? So it's, it's,

916
00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:27,180
I think it's just about finding the fact
that you need to find the happy medium,

917
00:53:27,181 --> 00:53:28,940
that happy balance and you know,

918
00:53:28,990 --> 00:53:32,250
have a good support system and to let
the kids know you really love them when

919
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:34,530
you're there.
That's what has worked for me.

920
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:39,550
But I can't say that sin recipe will
work for everyone because everyone is

921
00:53:39,961 --> 00:53:41,670
different. You know,
we're not all the same.

922
00:53:41,671 --> 00:53:44,070
So my DNA would be different
to the next person's DNA,

923
00:53:44,071 --> 00:53:46,830
but that is pretty much what I have done.
Yeah,

924
00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:49,400
that's interesting as well.
You touched on something.

925
00:53:49,401 --> 00:53:51,860
Do you believe you believe
that it's possible?

926
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:58,240
Um, not all the time. I
think something will good.

927
00:53:58,850 --> 00:54:02,720
You can't have it all, all the
time. You cannot, it's not possible.

928
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,290
So you have to decide on
what is important to you.

929
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:09,890
It's like the woman that decides to
stay at home with her kids that wanted a

930
00:54:09,891 --> 00:54:12,800
career but couldn't have it.
She's had to give certain things off.

931
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:16,280
So I don't think anyone can have it all.

932
00:54:16,281 --> 00:54:20,680
I think we just have to try and do the
best that we can and you know, live with,

933
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:23,870
you know,
just find the as good as we can really.

934
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:29,260
And to be honest with ourselves about
the capabilities and the capacities that

935
00:54:29,301 --> 00:54:33,710
we have because we can't do everything.
The only certain things that we can,

936
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:37,730
we can do. Um, I think we need to
just look at ourselves and say,

937
00:54:37,970 --> 00:54:42,080
this is who I am. Yes. When
I am in this mode of work,

938
00:54:42,590 --> 00:54:43,670
I can be obsessive.

939
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:46,400
My Friends gonna think I'm selfish
because I didn't want to see anybody,

940
00:54:46,401 --> 00:54:50,900
but it stops what gets me to
get the results that I need.

941
00:54:51,350 --> 00:54:55,550
Then I'm going to do those things and
when I'm done then I will find a way to

942
00:54:55,551 --> 00:55:00,130
just go back and get back into the
swing of things. And Yeah. Yeah.

943
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:10,670
I think we have a lot of talent in Nigeria
and if I look at the success of Ebony

944
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:13,460
Life Television,
it has been based on the fact that we,

945
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:16,340
I mean one of my biggest concerns at
the time when we actually started the

946
00:55:16,341 --> 00:55:18,050
channel was where am I
going to find the talent?

947
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:22,940
Cause I looked at the TV landscape and
I was pretty much appalled by the titans

948
00:55:22,941 --> 00:55:23,750
that I saw.

949
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:28,550
So I don't understand the hiring decisions
or how people decided to put certain

950
00:55:28,551 --> 00:55:32,540
and look at TV. I'm like, why is this
person on TV? What skills do they have?

951
00:55:32,541 --> 00:55:33,530
Why do they look this way?

952
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:37,830
So for me it was really important to
understand the look and feel that we're

953
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:42,540
after and then find the right people
that we could put into that looking for

954
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:44,780
living if they didn't have
the necessary experience.

955
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:49,370
I mean what means here today or Mimi when
we meet, um, she's, she does a lot of,

956
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:52,520
one was one of our presenters on the
channel and I remember that. How she,

957
00:55:52,521 --> 00:55:56,210
I mean she's also, I mean she's tenacious.
I mean I remember how she hounded me.

958
00:55:56,211 --> 00:55:59,660
Don at the time I said I wanted to become
a presenter on your channel and I was

959
00:55:59,661 --> 00:56:02,540
like, we don't have any spaces. And
then she'll keep sending you emails.

960
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:04,700
And then I said, okay,
send me your showreel.

961
00:56:04,850 --> 00:56:09,140
And then one day we needed to present a
full show and that's how she became one

962
00:56:09,141 --> 00:56:13,390
of our best presenters. I mean she is
so off the mark with just anything. So,

963
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:16,490
but prior to that, did you have any
experience really? She had known,

964
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:20,480
but I don't think anybody knows who
she is today, two or three years later.

965
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:25,210
So the same applies to our channel. Even
a Buka that is doing the big brother in,

966
00:56:25,211 --> 00:56:29,020
in, in South Africa is has been on the
spot and has been with us for many,

967
00:56:29,021 --> 00:56:31,660
many years.
We have in lots of talents in Nigeria,

968
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:36,370
but I think the reason why big brother's
been shot there is for business

969
00:56:36,371 --> 00:56:39,220
reasons. We are also shooting
in South Africa right now.

970
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:43,210
It's just for business reasons.
Also the world is a global village.

971
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:45,550
We can't keep limiting ourselves to,
oh,

972
00:56:45,551 --> 00:56:48,550
I'm fighting this cause that
everything must be done in Nigeria. No,

973
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:52,180
I want to do programs in America.
I want to do programs in the UK.

974
00:56:52,181 --> 00:56:54,520
Then I can sell to make UK broadcaster.

975
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:58,690
Why should my limit be
just in Nigerian market?

976
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,470
Especially with the night
I'd doing what is doing now

977
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:06,790
my guys and I actually off to England
to go and shoot some pilots and some of

978
00:57:06,791 --> 00:57:10,690
our very good shows with a British cast
and we're going to go to America to do

979
00:57:10,691 --> 00:57:13,810
the same as an American cast
because we need to widen the net.

980
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:18,400
Shonda Rhimes is a black woman just like
I am. She's written with an attorney.

981
00:57:18,401 --> 00:57:20,890
I don't think everybody in
prison afternoons black, right?

982
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:25,120
So she's just a very talented person
that is doing great work in the big world

983
00:57:25,121 --> 00:57:29,740
world of media. We have to learn
to take that on as well, and to be,

984
00:57:29,830 --> 00:57:33,460
to understand that we can go anywhere
in the world and make a content and the

985
00:57:33,461 --> 00:57:35,860
programming. That's, that's
what I think we need to do.

986
00:57:35,861 --> 00:57:38,980
We need to just open the blinkers
and just see the world widely.

987
00:57:39,310 --> 00:57:40,180
What it truly is,

988
00:57:40,181 --> 00:57:44,580
and that's what I want to do now
that the Niara has crashed and

989
00:57:44,890 --> 00:57:45,750
that you should do the same.
