1
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:11,110
[inaudible].

2
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,080
So first of all, thank you all for coming
today and thanks for having me again.

3
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,100
Uh, APP. Google is always
very nice to be here. Um,

4
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:26,680
so I've written a few books now and
this latest one, the Nordic baking book,

5
00:00:26,681 --> 00:00:29,740
you'd actually marks the end,
uh,

6
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,600
to a six year research process that
produced the Nordic cookbook after three

7
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:38,230
years and now finish this
with this publication.

8
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,480
And it's,
um,

9
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,780
the whole purpose of these books were to
be documentary and to tell people about

10
00:00:45,851 --> 00:00:50,200
Nordic food culture in a true way because
I think that Nordic food culture is

11
00:00:50,201 --> 00:00:54,550
one of the most misunderstood food
cultures on the planet. I mean, uh,

12
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:58,740
largely because of people like
myself actually, because if you, um,

13
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,590
if you search on the Internet for a
Nordic food culture in order to cooking

14
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,150
things like that,
uh,

15
00:01:04,151 --> 00:01:08,260
the first thing you get up is like a
thousand articles about Favi. Again,

16
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:13,060
the noma and a handful of other
very ambitious contemporary
restaurants and none

17
00:01:13,061 --> 00:01:17,590
of them really are very indicative of
how people actually in the Nordics.

18
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,990
Um,
and then aside of that,

19
00:01:19,991 --> 00:01:24,991
you also get the whole bunch of recipes
for a gravlax for hiring and for

20
00:01:26,321 --> 00:01:30,610
meatballs and cinnamon buns.
And those are Nordic dishes.

21
00:01:30,611 --> 00:01:33,220
But that's not really what people
need them and everyday basis either.

22
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,391
And then the last thing,

23
00:01:34,391 --> 00:01:37,990
you get this like a lot of people
photographing their meatball Mila at Ikea.

24
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,400
So I felt that,
uh,

25
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,540
there was a real need for these books and
it's been an enormous privilege to get

26
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:51,220
to spend this long, uh, supported
by publisher researching,

27
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,380
researching my own food culture,

28
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,330
the food culture that I thought I knew a
lot about and that it turned out that I

29
00:01:58,331 --> 00:02:02,980
knew a lot less than I
thought about. Um, and, uh,

30
00:02:02,981 --> 00:02:07,760
it's, it is a bit strange now to
see this, both books, outs, um,

31
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,950
the project being done.

32
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:13,450
But it's also amazing to see people
interact with both of the books,

33
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,020
tagging me in photos on
social media of bands.

34
00:02:17,021 --> 00:02:20,480
They've made people coming
to these lectures and, uh,

35
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:25,000
really learning about food culture that
I think they knew very little about

36
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:29,630
before.
And one thing that I learned,

37
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:34,740
especially during the second half of this
project is how great the diversity and

38
00:02:35,351 --> 00:02:37,990
the depth of Nordic Bacon culture.

39
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:42,340
And I come to believe very firmly that
Nordic baking culture is actually the

40
00:02:42,341 --> 00:02:46,510
greatest bacon culture on the planet
today in terms of diversity and depth.

41
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:51,940
And that might sound a little bit
less than obvious for most people. Uh,

42
00:02:51,941 --> 00:02:52,650
and,
uh,

43
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:56,620
my plan now is that I'm going to spend
the next 30 minutes or so talking about

44
00:02:56,621 --> 00:03:00,670
sort of making my case for Nordic
Bacon Culture and then, uh,

45
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:04,270
I'll open up for some questions towards,
towards the end.

46
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,910
Do we have a problem? Sorry, Justin. No,

47
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:17,620
Dustin. Um, so the,

48
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:22,010
the best place to start
when we talk about culture,

49
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,410
it's the people because without people,

50
00:03:24,411 --> 00:03:27,560
we can't have any culture
baking or otherwise.

51
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,600
And the Nordic region,

52
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:34,750
it's inhabited by about 26 million people
and they're spread out the a surface

53
00:03:35,091 --> 00:03:38,870
area just under 3.5
million square kilometers.

54
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:43,010
And that column by any stretch be called,
particularly then as they populated,

55
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,150
I mean, uh, we can compare
this to, for example,

56
00:03:47,151 --> 00:03:50,060
the whole rest of Europe
without the Nordics,

57
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:54,320
which would then have about 90
people per square kilometer.

58
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:58,470
It's even more interesting if you start
comparing to specific countries. Uh,

59
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,810
let's say France for example, France
has 116 people per square kilometer.

60
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:04,123
Germany,

61
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:08,600
the most populous country in Europe
has 237 people per square kilometer.

62
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,740
And as a little example,
to compare it to two,

63
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:17,810
if you were to take all of the Germans
and you have to spread them out in an

64
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,670
even layer across their whole country,

65
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:24,140
you would end up having a German
every 75 knee jerk in every direction,

66
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,980
one even layer. If you were to
do the same in the Nordic region,

67
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:31,040
there will be 375 meters
between each person.

68
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,200
And that's a huge difference.

69
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:39,020
So we have this vast
geographical area with a very,

70
00:04:39,021 --> 00:04:43,580
very scarce population. Um, I mean
if we were to go back in time,

71
00:04:43,581 --> 00:04:46,040
let's say a few hundred years to,
uh,

72
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:51,100
to an era when a lot of what we consider
our cultural identity of today was

73
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,030
actually founded,

74
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,080
what would this scarcity
of your population actually
have meant for the way that

75
00:04:59,721 --> 00:05:03,590
knowledge was transmitted
between people and anyone?

76
00:05:03,591 --> 00:05:07,340
Give me some examples perhaps. What
do you think, what would this mean?

77
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:11,660
Think before like social
media, television, cell
phones, all of this stuff.

78
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,993
Anyone else?

79
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:24,160
A lot of word of mouth. I mean the,
the, the, I think that the, um,

80
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,750
the most important sort of
general observation about
the difference between now

81
00:05:29,751 --> 00:05:32,900
and then we'll be that, uh, information,

82
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,830
knowledge everywhere would have been
transmitted at a much lower pace back then

83
00:05:36,831 --> 00:05:39,980
than it is now. And as
you say, word of mouth,

84
00:05:39,981 --> 00:05:42,710
you essentially had to talk face to face,

85
00:05:42,711 --> 00:05:47,711
to a person to acquire the information
that they might have a or you had to

86
00:05:47,811 --> 00:05:50,000
write the letter. And
I think that, I mean,

87
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:54,350
we can all agree that writing a physical
letter, although it's a beautiful thing,

88
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:54,831
a,

89
00:05:54,831 --> 00:05:59,831
is not a particularly efficient way of
lots of information quickly or I mean the

90
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:02,510
third option, if she wanted to
learn from a trusted source,

91
00:06:02,511 --> 00:06:04,460
you could also read a book.
And back then,

92
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:07,070
I mean 300 years ago there
were like three books.

93
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:11,300
One was the Bible and then there were
two more that didn't deal with baking

94
00:06:11,301 --> 00:06:16,200
Heider. So, uh, I mean none of these
things would have actually, uh, um,

95
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:21,500
really done much for the cultural baking.
So if we were to agree,

96
00:06:21,501 --> 00:06:26,240
then that information flowed
slower everywhere because
of the lack of technology.

97
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:31,310
I think we can also imagine that in an
area as scarcely populated as the Nordic

98
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:31,860
region,

99
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:36,860
this effect would have been further
exaggerate them simply because series just

100
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,580
much more distance between each person
that you can interact with face to face.

101
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,360
And this is very important for my recently
and it's something that I will come

102
00:06:44,361 --> 00:06:48,800
back to a little bit later. Um, and now
I'm going to make an example as well,

103
00:06:48,801 --> 00:06:51,200
sort of to illustrate this.
And so I have a,

104
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:54,020
my good friend Joe on here
tonight is it's there in the back.

105
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,730
He happened to be San Francisco today,

106
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,190
so he just came here to
have a little look as well.

107
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:03,550
And let's say that Yo one tomorrow would
invent a new cake recipe and he's not

108
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:06,140
just any cake recipe.

109
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:11,320
It's actually the most delicious cake
recipe ever invented by humankind.

110
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,290
It's completely revolutionary.
Um,

111
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,020
and he would bake this cake recipe.

112
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:24,030
Maybe he would share it with his family
and he would do what most people do

113
00:07:24,031 --> 00:07:28,830
today when they do something they're
proud of some, some kind of achievement,

114
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,080
he would share it on social media.

115
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:38,520
And because of this key,
and it's extreme deliciousness,

116
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,080
I mean, everyone who sees it on social
media, they're a bit excited because,

117
00:07:43,081 --> 00:07:45,660
I mean, he's claiming that he's
made the world's best cake, right?

118
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:49,350
And perhaps a few of them will ask for
the recipe and they will do the same

119
00:07:49,351 --> 00:07:49,561
thing.

120
00:07:49,561 --> 00:07:54,561
They were also bake it and little by
little sort of information generation by

121
00:07:54,661 --> 00:07:56,570
information generation.
Um,

122
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:01,590
this cake recipe spreads out into the
world and then all of a sudden maybe, uh,

123
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:04,710
you know, it hit someone with a
bit of, you know, a bit more reach,

124
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:09,150
perhaps a couple of hundred
thousand followers and it
gets even further out into

125
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,440
the world of information.

126
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,950
And all of a sudden it's featured
in Martha Stewart living, I mean,

127
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,030
no one's cake recipe.

128
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:20,370
And then it takes one more week and
it's my birthday back home in Sweden and

129
00:08:20,371 --> 00:08:23,330
Tova my wife, who has also
done a lot of the, uh,

130
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:27,150
recipe development for these two books.
She's made birthday cake,

131
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,370
but it's not my normal birthday cake,
which is the green Marzipan layer cake,

132
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:35,400
which is, you know, the princess cake, the
most delicious birth, the birthday cake,

133
00:08:35,401 --> 00:08:39,330
the race, I think. No, no, it's another
one. It's a new one, but it's not Yo,

134
00:08:39,331 --> 00:08:40,200
when's cake either.

135
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:45,480
It's the Vegan raw food version of your
landscape that Toby has gotten from her

136
00:08:45,481 --> 00:08:47,900
goop newsletter.
And,

137
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:52,750
and that's sort of how information
flows today when it comes to, um,

138
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:57,830
food much, much. And not
only does it spread quicker,

139
00:08:57,831 --> 00:08:59,640
lead more quickly over a large area,

140
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:03,120
it also mutates quicker
into new versions of itself.

141
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:05,300
And this is a huge difference.
I mean, this isn't,

142
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,750
hasn't been going on for very long.

143
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:12,700
And if we were to compare this with how
things were back couple of hundred years

144
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,870
ago, I mean, you're one could
still have invented the cake.

145
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,290
It will there be an equally
delicious as most today. Uh,

146
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:24,150
he would have made it for his family
and then like, that would have been it,

147
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,750
right?
And then perhaps a,

148
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,660
when your hands kids were to
leave the house, you know,

149
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:33,770
after 20 years of eating his cake,
uh,

150
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,100
perhaps they got married into the
neighboring farm 800 meters away. Um,

151
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:42,660
another four people with I learned
about the cake. So in, in, you know,

152
00:09:42,661 --> 00:09:45,150
in the span of 20 years, it
would have a spread, you know,

153
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,990
spread over a diameter of two kilometers
and eight people would have known about

154
00:09:48,991 --> 00:09:52,560
the case. The most delicious cake
invented by human guide. Uh, and I mean,

155
00:09:52,561 --> 00:09:54,600
this is a bit of an over exaggerating,
but I think,

156
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,750
I think that if you get the
point, um, and to put this simply,

157
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:03,790
a scarce population spread out over a
vast area used to me and to some extent

158
00:10:04,531 --> 00:10:09,180
still means today that knowledge
travels slower, um, this and it's turn,

159
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:13,530
it will always mean that you get the
more varied expression of all commonly

160
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:14,790
practiced culture.

161
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:19,740
This is simply because people are less
influenced by charter because they,

162
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,630
you know,
do less of the same stuff.

163
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,460
And this is one reason to why the
Nordic region has a more diverse baking

164
00:10:26,461 --> 00:10:28,770
culture than almost any
other region in the world.

165
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,950
And other reason for this diversity,
um,

166
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:38,990
that is also somewhat related to the
Scarsdale population and we'd really

167
00:10:39,061 --> 00:10:43,530
influences the, uh, making culture. It's
the bakeries and their role in society.

168
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,970
And in the Nordics baking culture,

169
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,180
it's not carried primarily
by commercial bakeries,

170
00:10:51,181 --> 00:10:53,010
but rather by people in their homes.

171
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,210
And this is not just something that used
to be accurate in the past. It's salty.

172
00:10:58,211 --> 00:11:02,520
It's something that still
applies today. And, and this is,

173
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,301
I mean,

174
00:11:03,301 --> 00:11:08,250
it has to do with geography because
what does bakeries need to sustain

175
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:13,140
themselves? Customers. Exactly.
I mean, they're going to
need to have people there.

176
00:11:13,141 --> 00:11:16,050
And if you have a 375 meters through,
you know,

177
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:18,980
every person that's not many.
Um,

178
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,840
and I mean there are definitely
bakeries in the Nordics.

179
00:11:21,841 --> 00:11:23,730
There's always been
bakeries in the Nordics,

180
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,150
but there are concentrated in
quite a small geographical area.

181
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:30,210
At least they used to be historically.
Um,

182
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:34,690
I mean you would have found most
of these bakeries that were, uh,

183
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,740
sort of common enough to produce
red as a daily staple in cities.

184
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,280
And most of the cities in the Nordics
are in the southern third of Sweden,

185
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:49,350
a bit on the, uh, sort of southwest
coast of Finland. All of them,

186
00:11:49,351 --> 00:11:52,080
mark and then an area or you know,

187
00:11:52,081 --> 00:11:54,640
around Oslow and a bit up
on the west coast of Norway.

188
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,910
That's where you would have found these
cities that were big enough to sustain.

189
00:11:57,911 --> 00:11:59,080
Baker is in the past.

190
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:06,930
And I actually did a little test
when I did another talk that was on a

191
00:12:07,451 --> 00:12:09,480
completely different subjects. Uh, yes.

192
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:14,490
Some weeks ago I had 100 people in the
room and I ask them all what they thought

193
00:12:14,921 --> 00:12:19,630
was the greatest bacon culture on the
planet. None of them's the Nordic.

194
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:23,290
What do you guys think? They said? Yeah,

195
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,710
they said the France or
99 of them said France.

196
00:12:26,711 --> 00:12:28,480
And then there was this one
guy who was an Austrian.

197
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,060
And I mean,
I started thinking about this and,

198
00:12:34,061 --> 00:12:36,820
and I think that I would've said Francis,
well,

199
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:41,850
before starting with this project
and I started thinking more about,

200
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:46,360
I mean, what, why did, why
does everyone think this?

201
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,090
Like what's the substance behind,
uh,

202
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:52,510
this immediate assumption from
almost every person you meet?

203
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,780
The French Bacon culture is the greatest,
greatest on the planet.

204
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:00,490
I think that this simply a
case and a great example,

205
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,301
or very,

206
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:06,070
very clever and successfully executed
branding exercise by the French.

207
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:11,890
You know, you visit France, uh,
there is, uh, but gets you buy them,

208
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:15,530
they're already clarity by them. And then
you'll have a great time in France. Um,

209
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,590
and I mean, if we start to look at
what French baking culture actually is,

210
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,600
it's the polar opposite to
with Nordic Pagan culture.

211
00:13:25,601 --> 00:13:30,460
Looks like I would on something
strange. Oh, good. Um,

212
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,970
as opposed to ours,
uh,

213
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:39,010
the French baking culture is almost
entirely driven by professional bakeries.

214
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:44,230
People in France, they don't
bake that much at home. And
I mean, why would they? Um,

215
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,390
there's a bakery in every tiny little
village in France and France is very

216
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:53,650
evenly and quite densely populated
as we said before. So I mean,

217
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:58,840
there's absolutely no incentive
to bake your own bread, uh, on a,

218
00:13:58,841 --> 00:14:01,420
on a regular basis so that
it becomes a daily staple.

219
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,680
And if we take this a step further and
think about what this actually means for

220
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:13,230
the culture of eating and baking bread,
um,

221
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:15,890
I imagine that many in this room,

222
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,750
perhaps almost all of you have been
to France and you've bought and eaten

223
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,950
something from a French bakery.

224
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,040
Perhaps you were there on vacation. I
mean, perhaps you live there for awhile.

225
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,170
I don't know.
Uh,

226
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:32,260
but I think that most of us can agree
that French bakeries are lovely places.

227
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,260
I mean,

228
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:38,260
the gets the butter across som to
partial Kula Africa turnovers flow path.

229
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:43,280
I mean,
all of these things are examples of great,

230
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:48,230
great pastries and bakes. And I
too love a French bakery. I mean,

231
00:14:48,231 --> 00:14:49,580
I used to live there.
Uh,

232
00:14:49,581 --> 00:14:52,700
I've been to a lot of them and
not just in Paris where I live,

233
00:14:52,701 --> 00:14:57,110
but all over the country. And when I
started thinking about these things,

234
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:01,130
one thing that I realized that
there are pretty much all the same.

235
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:07,270
They share almost exactly
the same repertoire of baked
goods regardless of where

236
00:15:08,271 --> 00:15:10,550
in France they are. And I mean, sure,

237
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:15,800
the butter roll into a
croissant in Brittany might
be a little bit saltier than

238
00:15:15,801 --> 00:15:17,060
the one I was at.
A Nice,

239
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:20,510
perhaps the apricots are fresh in the
south and their cabin in the north.

240
00:15:20,511 --> 00:15:24,610
And there are definitely some
regional variations and some, uh, uh,

241
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:29,600
regional specialties that are added on
to this standard repertoire across the

242
00:15:29,601 --> 00:15:33,230
country. But all in all,
they are remarkably similar.

243
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,030
And as I said before in France, people
rarely bake at home. And if they do,

244
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:42,490
they bake, uh, the search,
you know, might go to a,

245
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,850
the bakery by a role of a puff
pastry and go home and make telethon.

246
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:51,260
That's sort of the extent of it.
And I mean,

247
00:15:51,261 --> 00:15:52,160
as you can understand,

248
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:56,690
this is a not exactly a great
growing ground for a in cultural,

249
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,990
cultural individuality and diversity.
And I mean,

250
00:15:59,991 --> 00:16:02,180
this is because businesses,

251
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:07,900
bakeries are businesses and the businesses
they have to function financially.

252
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:13,190
And I mean this happens when you find
that sweet spot between what people want

253
00:16:13,191 --> 00:16:17,900
to buy and what's actually possible to
produce in a, an efficient enough manner.

254
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:21,920
So there is always going to be,
for all cultures,

255
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,880
cultures dominated by
businesses, certain, uh,

256
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:30,140
circumstances and rules around them that
will shape and quite the large degree

257
00:16:30,141 --> 00:16:33,950
streamline these places produce.
And I think that very often we'd food,

258
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:37,170
we tend to forget this because we were so,
I mean,

259
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:42,180
we take that for granted and we don't
really see food as part of normal business

260
00:16:42,891 --> 00:16:46,770
even though it is obviously.
And I think you can make, um,

261
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:50,810
a bit of a, an interesting
comparison with, for example,

262
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,400
other types of manufacturing.

263
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,340
Let's say that you compare
bakeries and car companies.

264
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:01,870
So almost all car companies except
for some cosmetic differences make

265
00:17:02,361 --> 00:17:03,860
essentially the same product,
right?

266
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:07,640
Rectangular box wheel in each corner.

267
00:17:07,641 --> 00:17:10,250
It goes either like that or
like that. Then you know, it,

268
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:13,160
they kind of do the same thing.
Um,

269
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:17,150
and the same rules apply there because
they're a business, you know, uh,

270
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,710
and they've collected,

271
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:22,490
we figure out the best way of producing
something that's as close as possible to

272
00:17:22,491 --> 00:17:25,370
where people want to buy. And it's
exactly the same for the bakeries.

273
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,640
And also most bakeries,

274
00:17:28,641 --> 00:17:32,030
they're run by bakers and
most bakers who run Baker's,

275
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:35,660
they've also gone to school somewhere
where they learned how to debate.

276
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:36,921
Incidentally,

277
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:40,640
they learn how to bake exactly the same
way as pretty much all of the others who

278
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,500
also went to school and started bakeries.

279
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:46,730
And because their business model
works and has worked for a long time,

280
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,790
most likely what they're going to teach
the next generation of bakers is some

281
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:53,400
iteration of what they're already doing.

282
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:57,720
And none of this really
promotes diversity and culture.

283
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,670
Um,
so in a bacon culture driven by bakeries,

284
00:18:02,671 --> 00:18:07,671
you will inevitably only have a fraction
of the diversity found in a culture

285
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,050
that's driven by people
baking in the home.

286
00:18:10,051 --> 00:18:13,830
And this is another reason
why there is no more diverse,

287
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,860
diverse baking culture in the
world than in the Nordics.

288
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:21,170
And I actually think that a comparison
between the u s and Sweden here and we

289
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,990
get it straight, it's the differences in
how much people actually bake at home.

290
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,490
Because something that I've understood
here in the US now when we've done all of

291
00:18:29,491 --> 00:18:34,050
the recipe testing with independent
recipe testers in America to see that the

292
00:18:34,051 --> 00:18:35,160
recipe is actually function.

293
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,840
And also something that I've come to a
talk a little about you bring this tour

294
00:18:39,841 --> 00:18:43,470
when we were meeting people and
talking about the book is that um,

295
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:46,860
it's hard to buy fresh yeast here.
I mean,

296
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:51,360
essentially it seems to me that if you
want to buy fresh yeast in America,

297
00:18:51,361 --> 00:18:55,410
you have to sort of sneak up in the alley
behind some bakery and like go in the

298
00:18:55,411 --> 00:18:59,520
back door and buy some of their
yeast stash, you know, uh,

299
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,190
which is very different from
how it will be in, for example,

300
00:19:02,191 --> 00:19:04,770
Sweden where you can buy fresh
yeast and every grocery store,

301
00:19:04,771 --> 00:19:07,890
every petrol station, every
seven, 11, many new stands,

302
00:19:07,891 --> 00:19:12,240
we'll have fresh cheese that is not just
because they have a pretty yellow color,

303
00:19:12,241 --> 00:19:13,980
the cubes and you know,
people have them for fun.

304
00:19:13,981 --> 00:19:17,040
It's because people buy them and people
buy them because they want to bake with

305
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:21,630
them. Um, and I think that this
illustrates how big a part of,

306
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,680
um, people sort of home cooking,
baking makes out in the Nordic region.

307
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:30,030
And then you'll have
geography and climate.

308
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:35,880
Another very important influence on
what people eat. And as I said before,

309
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,070
the Nordics,
it's a vast region.

310
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,910
I mean from the southern most bits of
Denmark all the way up to the northern

311
00:19:41,911 --> 00:19:44,880
parts of Spitsbergen islands,
north of Norway,

312
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,460
from Finland in the east to green.

313
00:19:47,461 --> 00:19:51,450
Then all the way in the West is a huge
region and you can fit all of the rest of

314
00:19:51,451 --> 00:19:52,980
Europe a whole bunch of times in there.

315
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:57,120
I think you can fit the whole universe
in there as well. Easily and sure.

316
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,830
I mean a lot of this is ocean,

317
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:04,410
but that doesn't really matter because
when it comes to cultural diversity, uh,

318
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,280
dependent on the geography,
it's not, you know,

319
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:09,800
the important thing is not
that it's evenly populated.

320
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:13,560
Important thing is the distance between
the extremes where people actually live

321
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:20,010
and in terms of climate
naturally in such a vast area,

322
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,520
you will also have a lot of
variation and this and it's turn.

323
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,630
It will mean that people are what people
have been able to grow in the past and

324
00:20:27,631 --> 00:20:31,080
thereby bake wood and integrate
into our culture. It's very,

325
00:20:31,081 --> 00:20:34,860
the lot depending on where they live.
And you can think of wheat, for example,

326
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:41,490
we this a grain that needs a fairly
particular circumstances to grow.

327
00:20:41,761 --> 00:20:45,120
Well, we need a long enough
in a warm enough summer,

328
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:50,780
it needs quite a lot of water and it
needs very fertile ground to grow well.

329
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:55,780
And these circumstances you won't
find everywhere in the Nordic region.

330
00:20:55,781 --> 00:21:00,650
You'll actually find them pretty much in
that same region where all of those CPS

331
00:21:00,651 --> 00:21:04,780
were located. Funnily, you know, um,
so in the southern third of Sweden,

332
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:07,720
a little bit on the, uh, uh,
finished west coast a little bit,

333
00:21:07,721 --> 00:21:09,490
didn't South Norway and all over Denmark.

334
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,980
That's where we was traditionally grown.

335
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,350
And it's also where most of the wheat
based recipes in traditional Nordic baking

336
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:22,480
happens to come from. And funnily
enough, what used to be, uh, you know,

337
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:25,240
practical limitations on, in
this essence, this in the past,

338
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:27,880
it tends to inform our
choices today a lot.

339
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,330
And then you can go on and you
can look at, for example, Denmark.

340
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:35,590
So Denmark has the most fertile
farmland in the Nordics.

341
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,990
It's a great agricultural production area.
And they grow a lot of weeds.

342
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:46,210
And wheat has always been a, an important
trade commodity, very expensive.

343
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:50,080
So what they used to do historically is
that they grew the weeds on their best

344
00:21:50,081 --> 00:21:54,190
land and then they sold it off to
continental Europe, almost all of it.

345
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,420
And on all of the poorer pieces of land,
instead of wheat,

346
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,730
they grew ry because ry,

347
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:04,480
it ripens very dependently
every summer in Denmark.

348
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:09,340
And the therefore have a really
great ride bread culture.

349
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:13,690
And because southern
Sweden is close to Denmark,

350
00:22:13,691 --> 00:22:15,940
you'll also find a bit of Rye bread there.

351
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:20,170
And you'll find in both Denmark and
South Sweden breads that you historically

352
00:22:20,171 --> 00:22:21,310
wouldn't have found anywhere else,

353
00:22:21,311 --> 00:22:25,330
which were brands that had both rye and
wheat in them because unique to this

354
00:22:25,331 --> 00:22:27,940
area.
And then you can look at Finland.

355
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,090
Finland has almost all rye,

356
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,120
almost no other grains are used
in traditional finish baking.

357
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,660
And this is because most of the
countries located too far north.

358
00:22:37,661 --> 00:22:42,120
So it's too cool in the summer for a,
the wheat to grow there. And then in the,

359
00:22:42,121 --> 00:22:46,630
in the sort of southern part, the
warmest part of Finland, um, it's, it's,

360
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,330
it has inland climate
towards the Russian border.

361
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,570
So even if it would have been warm
enough for the week to grow there in the

362
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:57,310
summer would have been long enough. It's
too dry so it doesn't work. But Rye,

363
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:01,510
it can take a lot less water during
the summer so they have, uh, you know,

364
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:06,660
it and it informs all of
their bacon culture where I
grew up further north up in

365
00:23:07,331 --> 00:23:08,500
Sweden,
uh,

366
00:23:08,501 --> 00:23:12,340
you can't grow wheat because it's too
cool and the summer you can't grow rye

367
00:23:12,341 --> 00:23:17,230
either for the same reason. So people use
to grow oats and barley and oats have,

368
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:20,110
it has no gluten at all in it.
And Barley,

369
00:23:20,111 --> 00:23:23,740
we'll have a little bit of gluten and
gluten. You need to make fluffy breads.

370
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,730
So the further north you
come in Scandinavia, the
flatter the bread's will be.

371
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,920
You know,
until you hit the point,

372
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:34,540
sort of halfway up through Sweden and
Norway where I used to grow up, um,

373
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,710
where the traditional Bates
would be only flatbreads,

374
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,820
either soft or dry.

375
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:47,000
And I mean, I'm going to compare this
to France again. Yes. Because it's a,

376
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:51,500
it's a very easy comparison to make.
So what Greens do we find in France?

377
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,720
It's like wheat everywhere.

378
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:59,120
They grow almost exclusively
weeds, I mean, and why would
they grow anything else?

379
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:02,870
Uh, pretty much all of the country except
for like the warmers and DIYers bits

380
00:24:02,871 --> 00:24:07,520
towards the southeast as a great growing
climate for weeds and wheat is in

381
00:24:07,521 --> 00:24:11,540
Europe and has traditionally been
the most well paid for grain crop.

382
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,760
But then you look at, you know,
the repertoire or recipes,

383
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:22,780
almost all of the recipes for both the
breads and savory pastries in France.

384
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:28,760
They're based on one single grain, which
is sweet. If you look all of the Nordics,

385
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,980
I mean we've had four different
grains who've all been, you know,

386
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:37,760
equally important to
specific parts of the region.

387
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,500
Meaning that we have four times as
much base material to work with,

388
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:47,630
meaning more diversity. We can do
the questions afterwards. Sorry.

389
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:51,270
So these sort of climate and it's,

390
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:55,790
it's limiting factors has historically
created a lot of diversity. Uh,

391
00:24:55,791 --> 00:25:00,170
and as, as I said before, the
Nordic region is also vast,

392
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:04,790
but it's a vast region that's located
almost all of it in the marginal climates

393
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:10,530
and it's marginal in a sense that for
people to successfully live there,

394
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:13,850
you know,
you have to plan ahead a little bit.

395
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:18,500
You can't just expect to harvest plant
based foods all throughout the year,

396
00:25:18,501 --> 00:25:18,820
which we,

397
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:21,970
which we shouldn't be the case and
quite a large part of the military and

398
00:25:21,971 --> 00:25:26,300
Mediterranean area. Um, you know,
a big part of Asia for example,

399
00:25:26,301 --> 00:25:28,220
and a lot of warmer climates in the world,

400
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:33,110
you wouldn't really have any
incentive to, um, store foods,

401
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,760
at least not for a longer period of time.

402
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:40,400
And the interesting thing with
all of these marginal climates,

403
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,100
it doesn't really matter
where you are in the world.

404
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:48,490
They have two product groups in common
that have been like a huge historical

405
00:25:50,001 --> 00:25:51,770
importance.
Um,

406
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:55,670
and essentially things that made
people live through the harsh winters.

407
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:58,340
And those two product groups.
There are grains and dairy

408
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:04,220
and both grains and dairy.
There are not only high in energy,

409
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:09,200
but they're also very easily produced
in large quantities during fairly cool

410
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,940
summers.
And on top of that,

411
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:15,950
both grains and dairy there are
easily prepared for storage.

412
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:21,020
I mean with there you can think like
culture, their products, butter, cheese,

413
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:25,640
all things that keep really well and all
things that are very dense in energy so

414
00:26:25,641 --> 00:26:30,550
they don't talk, they don't take up a lot
of storage space when you keep them. Uh,

415
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,281
for the cereals.

416
00:26:31,281 --> 00:26:36,020
I mean all seeds of perennial
grasses make great storage crop.

417
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,480
They dry well,
um,

418
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:40,490
the store well and they can be turned
into a lot of different things.

419
00:26:40,491 --> 00:26:45,420
And it doesn't matter. I mean, if
you're a in the Peruvian Andes,

420
00:26:45,421 --> 00:26:47,970
if you're in a monastery,
in Bhutan, in the Himalayas,

421
00:26:47,971 --> 00:26:50,910
or if you're like in a suburb
of us too soon where I grew up,

422
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:56,900
it doesn't matter if it's a corn or a
red rice or wheat or if it's milk from a

423
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,530
lama or York or cow.

424
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:06,330
The same sort of basic principles
apply all of these marginal climates.

425
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:12,780
And I think that baking, which I thought
was going to be very easy to define,

426
00:27:12,781 --> 00:27:15,120
the baking is turns out that
is not easy to define at all.

427
00:27:15,121 --> 00:27:18,870
And I think that baking is simply like
a catch all phrase for all of the ways

428
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:20,790
that humankind can,
uh,

429
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:26,090
turn grains sometimes in the
combination with dairy into a food.

430
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:28,960
How we can turn,

431
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,960
can turn a these two basic product
groups into something that's more easily

432
00:27:34,021 --> 00:27:37,370
digestible, more tasty and
more varied than, you know,

433
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,180
the products are on their own.

434
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:44,040
And I think that the fact that we've
created so much variation with such a

435
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:49,041
limited number of base products as we
have in baking compared to savory food,

436
00:27:50,011 --> 00:27:52,290
I mean, just imagine how
almost all baking recipes,

437
00:27:52,291 --> 00:27:56,280
they contain like the same five
things in different variations.

438
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,650
And if you look at the savory cooking,

439
00:27:58,651 --> 00:28:02,120
you have thousands of different
based products that, you know,

440
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,870
becomes various combinations.

441
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:08,040
And I think that there's great diversity
in number of recipes and expressions in

442
00:28:08,041 --> 00:28:10,610
baking. It really, uh, uh,

443
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:15,950
says a lot about how important and how
big a part of our daily caloric intake

444
00:28:16,201 --> 00:28:18,840
that used to come from grains and
dairy. You know, we were really,

445
00:28:18,841 --> 00:28:21,690
really motivated to create a
lot of diversity in recipes.

446
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,010
So today,
uh,

447
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:30,570
we often tell ourselves that we decide
what we eat all the time that no one else

448
00:28:30,571 --> 00:28:33,750
dictates what products we buy
and what we make from them.

449
00:28:33,751 --> 00:28:38,070
And from my perspective, this is
obviously completely wrong because I mean,

450
00:28:38,071 --> 00:28:42,180
we are animals and we do exactly
what our species is always done. We,

451
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:45,930
we procure whatever products that
make sense to us there and then,

452
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,220
and we prepared them in whatever way
that makes sense to us there. And then,

453
00:28:50,221 --> 00:28:54,930
and then we eat them ourselves or with
our flock. I mean, that's what we do.

454
00:28:56,190 --> 00:29:00,240
And the thing though that
fascinates me so much with this,

455
00:29:00,241 --> 00:29:01,920
especially when it comes to baking,

456
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:07,250
it's the amount of cultural knowledge
that transmitted between generations

457
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,820
because eating correctly,
grown, preserved, stored,

458
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,660
and subsequently prepared foods
made from grains and dairy,

459
00:29:15,661 --> 00:29:20,020
it used to be incredibly
important for ancestors. Uh,

460
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,470
for them it was a simply about survival,

461
00:29:22,471 --> 00:29:27,471
which is the single strongest motivating
force of the human being today for

462
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:33,480
almost all of us eating breads and cakes
and buns and cookies or whatever else

463
00:29:33,481 --> 00:29:37,040
we've baked, it's mostly
about pleasure. Right? Um,

464
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,930
and why do we find it's so pleasurable?

465
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:45,520
The EEC explanation here is that these
items are dentists in energy and that we

466
00:29:45,521 --> 00:29:50,380
are predisposed to like things that
are dentists in energy and that might

467
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:54,790
explain why we find a piece of cookie,
very tasty,

468
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:59,800
but it doesn't explain why we're so
motivated to pass on this cultural

469
00:29:59,801 --> 00:30:02,830
information between generation and
why it's so pleasurable to bake.

470
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:07,060
And I think that's simply a are you know,

471
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:09,040
humankind's sort of,
um,

472
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:14,380
function put in flight in
place by humankind in our
subconscious minds to make

473
00:30:14,381 --> 00:30:17,800
sure that we don't lose this information.
Yes.

474
00:30:17,801 --> 00:30:20,930
Because there's a new generation coming.
Um,

475
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:26,250
I mean almost everyone I know take more
pleasure and they feel more satisfied

476
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,860
when they've baked something than
when they've cooked something savory.

477
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,470
I mean personally I'm more happy,
but you know,

478
00:30:32,471 --> 00:30:35,860
when I bake a sponge cake than one day,
then when I'm making an oven omelettes.

479
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:41,740
Um, and I think this is just a really
good a indicator, you know, on,

480
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:44,680
uh, how our minds function. And

481
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:51,550
this sort of boils down to my final
big reason as to why the Nordic Bacon

482
00:30:51,551 --> 00:30:54,670
culture truly is the
greatest around there. Uh,

483
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,150
preparing all of these grains
and dairy products. Well,

484
00:30:58,151 --> 00:31:02,750
it's used to be more important where I
come from than in almost any other part

485
00:31:02,751 --> 00:31:03,221
of the world.

486
00:31:03,221 --> 00:31:07,870
And I think this is also the reason why
most people in the Nordics still bake

487
00:31:07,871 --> 00:31:11,710
more in their homes, then people
doing other parts of the world.

488
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:15,310
We just take more pleasure in it because
it used to be more important for us in

489
00:31:15,311 --> 00:31:19,360
the past. And as we'd all culture, I mean,

490
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:24,190
if culture is regularly practiced,
you know, on an everyday basis,

491
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:27,450
if culture is allowed to, um, uh,

492
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,950
change gradually because of use,

493
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:35,230
it will always be more diverse and deeply
rooted than if it's carried out by the

494
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:39,790
Sfu people or you know, uh,
kept intact in a bubble.

495
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:44,610
And I think this is like the final
reason from my side too. Why, uh,

496
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:48,160
the Nordic Bacon culture is just the
most diverse making culture on the planet

497
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:49,540
today.
Thank you.

498
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:55,660
[inaudible]

499
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:02,790
and now we can do questions.
Do we have in Miker? Yeah.

500
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:07,860
Cool. And it can be questions about this,
uh, about the project with these books.

501
00:32:07,861 --> 00:32:10,440
They can be questions about Favi and
my restaurant can be questions about

502
00:32:10,441 --> 00:32:12,580
anything you want really.
So Rachel Hanson,

503
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:17,950
you mentioned that sort of during the
process for researching this entire

504
00:32:17,951 --> 00:32:21,010
project that, uh, you
thought at the beginning,

505
00:32:21,011 --> 00:32:23,880
you knew a lot about serving more
include culture in order to compete and

506
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:25,900
culture, but you found that
you need a lot less than,

507
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:30,580
what are some examples of
some particularly interesting
things that you learned?

508
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,100
For me, the, uh,

509
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:36,720
the most interesting I
learned was actually how much
diversity there south there.

510
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,950
Um, because I, I mean, first of all,

511
00:32:39,951 --> 00:32:43,580
there's no such thing as a common
Nordic identity. Uh, I don't know if,

512
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,950
I mean there are some Nordic people here
for sure. I mean there might be more,

513
00:32:45,951 --> 00:32:49,940
but I think all, all of us living
in the Nordic region, we, uh,

514
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,540
we feel a strong identity
connected to where we're from,

515
00:32:53,541 --> 00:32:57,860
but that's usually not like, hey, I'm
Nordic. You know, I'm Swedish. Um,

516
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:02,890
and I think that because of this we
might not have been sort of receptive to,

517
00:33:05,181 --> 00:33:09,260
uh, uh, be sort of our neighboring
cultures as much as we should have.

518
00:33:09,261 --> 00:33:13,040
At least that's sort of applies to me.
And just traveling around, you know,

519
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,510
meeting people in their
homes, uh, talking about food,

520
00:33:17,511 --> 00:33:21,080
seeing what the actually cook and
bake on an everyday basis. Uh,

521
00:33:21,081 --> 00:33:23,510
it's just been eye opening.
How much, you know,

522
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,730
difference in cultural
diversity is out there.

523
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,590
What's the difference in bread between
hand kneading it and he's a kitchen aid.

524
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:34,670
Uh,
I mean the kitchen aid specifically,

525
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,810
it's a one way of machine needing but,

526
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:39,951
and you know,

527
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:43,220
it has a specific expression because of
the size of the bowl and the way moves.

528
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:48,260
But I think that if we look at like
machine process versus hand processed,

529
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:51,950
like theoretically there
has to be no difference.

530
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:55,820
Like it doesn't have to be
any difference. Um, and uh,

531
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:58,860
because the doe doesn't know what's
going on to it, you know, and,

532
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,370
and there is a lot of different machines
that can take care of this and this is

533
00:34:01,371 --> 00:34:04,090
something that I've spoken to
a lot of bakers about and, uh,

534
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:08,030
very begrudgingly and most of them agree
that the machine should be able to do

535
00:34:08,031 --> 00:34:11,420
with exactly as well as a human being,
but then they were a hundred parts of the,

536
00:34:11,421 --> 00:34:12,254
uh,
uh,

537
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:17,150
baking process that machines at least
not yet are able to replicate perfectly.

538
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,830
In your research,
did you find any regional difference?

539
00:34:20,831 --> 00:34:25,520
It's when the difference depending on
where they've grown up thinking about all.

540
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:30,580
Okay.
What about different kinds of brands?

541
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:34,460
Different coming from different
parts at least at all,

542
00:34:34,461 --> 00:34:36,830
just so mixed into processing.
We don't really know.

543
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:40,310
The thing is that, I mean,
if you look further back,

544
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:42,290
there was more regional diversity when,

545
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,100
when farmers would take and produce
their own seed from their crop and then

546
00:34:46,101 --> 00:34:47,420
receive that next year,

547
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:52,040
you would have a larger degree of
genetic of the diversity and whatever was

548
00:34:52,041 --> 00:34:56,540
produced in various regions,
not just grains, but today,

549
00:34:56,541 --> 00:35:01,100
I mean for the last hundred plus years,

550
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:02,060
uh,

551
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:06,950
pretty much all of the commercial growers
of cereal crops used to same handful

552
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:10,210
of, uh, varieties. Um,

553
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:13,700
and in this book it's
about this documentary,

554
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:16,790
a object about what
people bake today at home,

555
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:22,450
meaning that most of the research has
also been into what people use at home,

556
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:25,870
which is largely the same types of flour.
Yeah,

557
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:29,520
I just got, it would be interesting
to have terroir of different,

558
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:32,150
it will be very interesting to
have terroir of different grains,

559
00:35:32,151 --> 00:35:36,260
but it's actually nonexistent.
Yeah. Uh, I mean there are,

560
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:40,530
we buy for to fabric and
we buy a specific variety,

561
00:35:40,531 --> 00:35:43,590
so various grains from specific
farms and we used up, but I mean,

562
00:35:43,591 --> 00:35:47,220
that's a very extreme
expression of a baking.

563
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:50,940
That's not a at all representative
of where people bake in the home.

564
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,530
And I think that's,

565
00:35:52,531 --> 00:35:56,760
we will most likely never have that
type of variety in the home. Yes.

566
00:35:56,761 --> 00:35:58,470
For practical reasons.
I mean,

567
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:03,450
and then whether that's sad or
whether it's efficient than good,

568
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:07,380
I mean that's up to
anyone. And for me, uh,

569
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,530
I mean I love being part of making this
book has also be too mean to sort of

570
00:36:10,531 --> 00:36:12,300
remove my opinions from
the content matter,

571
00:36:12,301 --> 00:36:15,620
which is not easy all the time because
when you run a restaurant like five

572
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:15,840
weekend,

573
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,140
it's all about pushing your agenda and
your opinion and showcasing that in the

574
00:36:19,141 --> 00:36:19,770
food.

575
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:22,770
But for it to be documentary
and representative for
the region that I had to

576
00:36:22,771 --> 00:36:26,390
sort of remove that therapeutic

577
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:31,680
therapeutic, there's to make, I mean,

578
00:36:31,681 --> 00:36:34,830
I think that the pretty much all
baking can be fairly therapeutic.

579
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:37,770
I like making chocolate old new balls,
uh,

580
00:36:37,771 --> 00:36:41,280
which is essentially butter and
sugar and oatmeal and cocoa powder.

581
00:36:41,281 --> 00:36:44,640
And very rarely does it ever make
it to the both stage. I mean,

582
00:36:44,641 --> 00:36:46,920
usually it's sort of just disappears.
Meanwhile,

583
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:52,460
you mentioned earlier talking
about the fresh sheets.

584
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,150
I've definitely found it very frustrating.

585
00:36:55,151 --> 00:36:58,100
And following Nordic case
because the expectations of like

586
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,030
you mentioned that you did some testing
changes.

587
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,990
Did you find that you have to make
are with, how did you acknowledge,

588
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:12,020
yeah, so it's actually, it's a
bit complicated because as I said,

589
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:15,860
it's a documentary books and none of the
recipes have been adapted in any way.

590
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:18,460
Uh, not, you know,

591
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:22,700
to sort of better fit specific
territories or even if,

592
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:24,000
I mean I've seen a lot of recipes are,

593
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:27,020
I'm like I can do that so much
better if I change it to the bit,

594
00:37:27,021 --> 00:37:29,270
but I haven't done that.
And the same thing goes here.

595
00:37:29,271 --> 00:37:32,780
So what I've done though is that I
written narrative texts and I sort of

596
00:37:32,781 --> 00:37:35,660
provided information on
some of these topics.

597
00:37:35,661 --> 00:37:37,910
Like I written how yeast
functions for example,

598
00:37:37,911 --> 00:37:40,420
and what the differences would
be between freshmen right east.

599
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,400
And then we explain that a little bit in
how to substitute and how to work with

600
00:37:43,401 --> 00:37:48,110
that. I written about the variation in
different flowers because there's a huge

601
00:37:48,111 --> 00:37:49,810
difference in flowers across the world,

602
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:52,160
not just the thing in American
counterparts, but everywhere.

603
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:55,220
And even within the u s there's a
big difference in how flower behaves.

604
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,120
And then there is also other recipes
you know what to do if you don't have a

605
00:37:59,121 --> 00:38:01,130
giant wood fired brick oven for example,

606
00:38:01,131 --> 00:38:04,270
when you make bad breads and
stuff like that. Um, but it,

607
00:38:04,271 --> 00:38:06,200
this documentary and the recipes as such,

608
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:08,540
they are exactly as they
are in the Nordic region.

609
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:13,350
I'm really curious to hear more
about the interaction of identity and

610
00:38:13,351 --> 00:38:17,940
nationality. Um, do you
do if the case that um,

611
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:20,460
there's not a sort of,
there hasn't been an this,

612
00:38:20,461 --> 00:38:25,461
this identity of a culture because there's
so much regional diversity and then

613
00:38:26,161 --> 00:38:28,840
also on the other side you're,

614
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:32,880
your books are branding this idea
of Nordic cuisine or are you,

615
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:36,100
do you think there a broader Nordic
identity you'd be on the national

616
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,070
identity that is emerging or
that you would like to see?

617
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:43,270
I think that it's always been there. It's
just that, you know, I was living there.

618
00:38:43,271 --> 00:38:47,860
We don't like to acknowledge it because
we feel more strongly for our specific

619
00:38:47,861 --> 00:38:52,210
national identity rather than like your
common Nordic one and the common and the

620
00:38:52,211 --> 00:38:56,450
Nordic region. I mean it's a geographical
region. It's not a cultural region. Um,

621
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,760
but there are a lot of things that sort
of bind us together a culturally as well.

622
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:04,750
Um, but they're equally many
things that sort of tell us apart.

623
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:08,270
And one interesting thing that you can
see when it comes to the, you know,

624
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:12,250
where people used to cook and still cooks
today and as well for that matter is

625
00:39:12,251 --> 00:39:16,780
that at at this sort of
base you have these uh,

626
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:21,010
claim math. Again, geographical
differences. That's a
constant, that's just there.

627
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:25,000
And then on top on top of that you'll
have a geographic or a cultural layer as

628
00:39:25,001 --> 00:39:29,080
well, like a little cultural
filter that informs a, you know,

629
00:39:29,081 --> 00:39:31,870
what people do with these
geographical circumstances.

630
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:37,200
And most of that I would say it actually
depends on whom occupied whom in the

631
00:39:38,231 --> 00:39:41,890
past. Um, which is sort of strange
and a bit interesting and funny,

632
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:47,020
but you can divide the Nordic
region into two cultural regions.

633
00:39:47,021 --> 00:39:51,820
One that's Swedish influenced and that's
like from Sweden and then Finland and

634
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:54,370
around the Baltics or the
Baltic countries in Poland.

635
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:56,080
And they're not part
of the Nordics anymore,

636
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:59,290
but they have a very
distinctive sort of Swedish, uh,

637
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:02,140
influence on that cultural layer,
on top of the geography.

638
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:06,730
And then the western bit would have
the same with Danish influence.

639
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:10,600
And it really shows because in
that cultural legion, for example,

640
00:40:10,601 --> 00:40:13,330
you have green than the
Faroe Islands and Iceland,

641
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:16,300
I mean green than a Faroe islands
are still part of Denmark.

642
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:21,130
Iceland was occupied by then
more for many, many years.
Uh, none of these islands,

643
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,023
um,

644
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:27,090
would have ever seen any green before
the deans came because the climates,

645
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:32,770
you know, it doesn't really
support growing grains. Uh,
and there are so isolated.

646
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:39,450
But today they have a bread culture and
you can trace almost all of it back to

647
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:42,160
the Danish cultural influence.
All of these countries,

648
00:40:42,161 --> 00:40:44,020
they will have their own version,
or for example,

649
00:40:44,021 --> 00:40:46,270
like the very iconic and Danish Rye bread,

650
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:50,650
but made to suit their circumstances
on Iceland, for example,

651
00:40:50,651 --> 00:40:55,090
the country that has
almost no trees, the, uh,

652
00:40:55,420 --> 00:41:00,420
source of energy to heat the home was
traditionally a peat moss that was dug out

653
00:41:01,271 --> 00:41:05,890
of a peat bog and lug it home and dry
it and then burnt and obviously a very

654
00:41:05,891 --> 00:41:08,050
laborious process to create fuel,

655
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:12,760
meaning that people weren't exactly
inclined to fire up a giant brick oven to

656
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:16,900
bake a loaf of bread. So, I mean,
before the Danes came there to,

657
00:41:16,901 --> 00:41:20,430
didn't really have any, any
type of baked goods at all, uh,

658
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:25,440
with the deans came people from
Denmark who obviously lived on Iceland,

659
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:29,680
uh, because it was occupied,
you know, managing everything
they wanted their bread.

660
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,620
And Iceland has a lot
of volcanic activity.

661
00:41:32,621 --> 00:41:36,380
So what people did instead was just
dig holes in the ground outside of the

662
00:41:36,381 --> 00:41:40,580
villages and lower a bucket of
Rye bread down into the hole,

663
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:44,150
come back in the day after in the morning
and pick up a loaf of steamed bread.

664
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:47,660
And that still goes on today and
he's very easy to think, you know,

665
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:48,770
when you're in Iceland that,
oh,

666
00:41:48,771 --> 00:41:51,590
they've been doing this
for like a thousand years,
but they haven't, you know,

667
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:53,360
they'd been doing it for like 200 years,

668
00:41:53,361 --> 00:41:55,760
which is not very long and
historic or historical perspective.

669
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:59,520
That's not so bad.
What is your favorite recipe in this book?

670
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,100
I mean, as I said before, it's been,

671
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:06,810
most of the process has been about me not
imposing too much of my opinion on the

672
00:42:06,811 --> 00:42:09,570
content matter.
Um,

673
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:14,700
and the choice of recipes it entirely
independent on what I think is good and

674
00:42:15,421 --> 00:42:16,200
bad.

675
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:20,490
It's about what represents the most
people in the region and the most parts of

676
00:42:20,491 --> 00:42:23,070
the regions as well as possible.
But then naturally, I mean,

677
00:42:23,071 --> 00:42:28,050
there are recipes that for various reasons
I personally feel more for and they

678
00:42:28,051 --> 00:42:30,620
will probably be things that has to
do with my childhood. Like, yeah,

679
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:32,310
soft Swedish flatbreads.
For example,

680
00:42:32,311 --> 00:42:34,770
I'm going to chocolate balls
I mentioned earlier. Um,

681
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,630
and then things I didn't know existed,
like the Icelandic Rye bread.

682
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:40,890
Also to me very appealing if even
if I've never baked it myself.

683
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,410
I mean just the fact
that it's sort of exists.

684
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:48,420
I have a question about flowers and
you just have a recommendation for a

685
00:42:48,421 --> 00:42:52,530
resource professional or the non
culinary school educated person.

686
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:54,600
I love baking and Rick started,

687
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:57,870
we have always been interested
in alternative flours
and I'm really interested

688
00:42:57,871 --> 00:42:58,850
more in wheat flours.

689
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:03,810
Just the variation of the flowers and
understanding of protein content and how

690
00:43:03,811 --> 00:43:07,020
they all interact and what brands to buy.
Simple things like that.

691
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:11,490
I find myself playing different
places on the Internet and googling

692
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:18,300
and I don't know what's right and I'm
just wondering if there's a central

693
00:43:18,301 --> 00:43:20,580
resource that you would tell
someone to go to. Oh, this is it.

694
00:43:20,581 --> 00:43:21,790
The education on flour.

695
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:26,610
Um, I don't have one specific
one that's available here.

696
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:31,590
Uh, and what I do know is that there
is like a huge amount of difference,

697
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:35,490
not just in what grains
that are used to make flour,

698
00:43:35,491 --> 00:43:39,420
but also in the various processes
use like how things are milled, uh,

699
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,910
how things are age,
how they are transported and so on.

700
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,430
And it all affects how
they bake in the end.

701
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:49,480
So I think that the only thing that I can
suggest just, I mean try buying flour,

702
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:53,760
that seems to be good, you know, cause
how many a hundred reasons then yes,

703
00:43:53,761 --> 00:43:56,040
the pure functionality,
it might be that it's organic,

704
00:43:56,041 --> 00:44:00,510
that is mill close to where you
live, whatever by that and then, um,

705
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:01,410
use only that,

706
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:05,550
I'm thinking you were learning how it
behaves and then you'll be able to adapt

707
00:44:05,551 --> 00:44:07,880
recipes into that, you know? Um,

708
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:11,720
and it's very hard to be general
about these things because they, they,

709
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:14,490
they differ so much and there are no,
I mean,

710
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:19,410
I haven't found any great books on this.
There's lots of research papers. I mean,

711
00:44:19,411 --> 00:44:20,470
you can do it into like university,

712
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,480
the search engines and you can look
for things and read people's crappy

713
00:44:24,481 --> 00:44:28,120
abstracts about, you know, wheat
kernels and things like that. Uh,

714
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:32,580
and it is very interesting. Um, but
maybe someone should write that though.

715
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:38,450
Just defined baking as
the transformation and,

716
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:43,640
uh,
my family is a Norwegian word.

717
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:51,190
I never, yes. To protect the rights. Well,

718
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:52,980
never. Yes, potato. Yeah. Yeah.

719
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:58,480
Is that it does anything about it.

720
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:01,390
[inaudible] is a,

721
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:06,040
the traditional Norwegian flatbread and
the big difference between left Sir and

722
00:45:06,041 --> 00:45:09,790
most of the other flat breads in the
Nordic region is that they are griddled,

723
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:13,800
they're not baked in an oven and uh,

724
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:18,130
they also use other, it's not
just flower based, I should say.

725
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,870
Quite a few of them have potato in them.

726
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:23,110
A lot of them have peas in them
as well and things like that.

727
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:27,880
And the reason why they're not oven
bake this stuff, most of Norway,

728
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:32,140
uh, it's a bit like Iceland in the
sense that there are not any like large,

729
00:45:32,141 --> 00:45:37,000
deep forests in most of the country.
And that's compared to Sweden for example,

730
00:45:37,001 --> 00:45:41,560
where like the generation,
all my grand grandparents,

731
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:45,130
I mean they all had a thousand
hectares. So pine forest, you know,

732
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:48,550
that was pretty much worthless.
All it was good for was fire wood.

733
00:45:48,551 --> 00:45:49,480
So they had a lot of that.

734
00:45:49,481 --> 00:45:53,830
Then therefore we have a tradition of
these great big brick ovens on every farm.

735
00:45:53,831 --> 00:45:56,890
There is one of those solo,
our flatbreads are baked in that Norway,

736
00:45:56,891 --> 00:45:58,660
they didn't have access
to a few in that way,

737
00:45:58,870 --> 00:46:03,870
so they had to be more energy efficient
and a little fire under a grid.

738
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:08,020
It'll, you know, it's a, it's a much
more efficient way of baking flatbreads.

739
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:09,820
So I think,
yeah,

740
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:14,550
and your research, you try to cut off,
like you said, uh, alternate his recipes.

741
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:19,280
Are there any recipes or like red spade
very far off regions of you worried

742
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:23,040
about will kind of die out or anything
that you want to do to preserve?

743
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:29,130
So this is also something that I realized
during this process and before this I

744
00:46:29,741 --> 00:46:34,741
think that I was more on the sort of
opinion that a traditional food culture is

745
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:39,970
very important to preserve acidosis.

746
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:42,760
And I've come to realize more
and more that is actually,

747
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:46,690
that's completely wrong because food
culture has to be allowed to evolve and we

748
00:46:46,691 --> 00:46:51,670
will always, um, eat what makes
sense to us wherever we are,

749
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:56,320
whoever we are and whatever
time it will be. Um,

750
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:59,400
what's important though
is to preserve the, uh,

751
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:04,590
knowledge to make sure that food culture
is properly and accurately documented

752
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:08,240
because it's a waste of knowledge
if it just sort of, you know,

753
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,690
stops being practiced and then
everyone just forgets about that.

754
00:47:10,691 --> 00:47:13,750
It might've taken a generations
are thousands of years,

755
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:18,460
was sort of empirical study and living to
come up with a lot of these techniques.

756
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:22,960
But, uh, and, and this is a, it's
a hard thing actually because, uh,

757
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:27,430
almost everyone has doesn't, you
know, no, quite agree with me on this.

758
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:28,180
Almost everyone,

759
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:33,070
I think often thinking just sort of a
says that's these traditional service.

760
00:47:33,071 --> 00:47:36,160
So important to keep allowing, but like
who's going to keep them alive? I mean,

761
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:40,240
in Sweden we have sour
herring, for example, the
stinkiest food on planet earth.

762
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:43,240
Um, and I think that, I mean,

763
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,030
wait 30 more years and
it's going to be gone.

764
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:47,500
Okay.

765
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,630
And I'm not going to be
sorry that it's gone,

766
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:54,700
but I will be very sorry if the knowledge
on how to make it will disappear. Yes.

767
00:47:54,701 --> 00:47:55,840
Because we don't eat it anymore.

768
00:47:55,980 --> 00:48:00,420
No.
Hello.

769
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:02,580
It seems to me like

770
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:11,570
a lot of us eat home cooked food everyday.

771
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:15,680
I haven't seen that to the same
standards and other pieces though.

772
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:20,460
First of all.
That's true.

773
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:27,740
I think, yeah, I think it's
absolutely true. Uh, even today,

774
00:48:27,741 --> 00:48:30,830
I mean the, the, the development
in the Nordic region,

775
00:48:30,831 --> 00:48:34,010
especially in the bigger cities
are people eat more and more out.

776
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:36,980
It becomes more and more like
other parts of the world. Um,

777
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:42,220
but we still eat a bigger part of our
meals in the home cooked by ourselves than

778
00:48:43,281 --> 00:48:44,960
almost any other western culture does.

779
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:48,890
And I think it has to do with the
historically a lot of different reasons.

780
00:48:48,891 --> 00:48:53,891
One of them being scared of the population
that is just not enough people in a

781
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:56,600
large part of the region
to sustain restaurants.

782
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,860
And then I think that there are cultural
factors on top of that as well as

783
00:49:00,861 --> 00:49:04,730
religion, for example,
and many other things. Um,

784
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:05,850
yeah.

785
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:09,510
But what I do know though is that this
is one of the reasons why Nordic food

786
00:49:09,511 --> 00:49:13,790
culture and making culture is so little
understood because it's inaccessible,

787
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,540
not just the way I spoke about before.

788
00:49:15,541 --> 00:49:20,541
With like stop a recorded information
but also like the practical act of eating

789
00:49:21,301 --> 00:49:23,730
Nordic food.
I mean if you go to Sweden for example,

790
00:49:23,731 --> 00:49:25,770
as a tourist and you go to stock
and when you think to yourself,

791
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:28,980
I'm going to have, you know, one
traditional Swedish mean when I'm here,

792
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:32,720
you're not going to get that is not
a single restaurant in Stockholm that

793
00:49:32,721 --> 00:49:33,980
producers and uh,
uh,

794
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:38,400
something that's remotely close to like
an authentic version or people eat in

795
00:49:38,401 --> 00:49:39,234
their homes.

796
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:39,980
Okay.

797
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:42,410
Cause that's not what restaurants
are about in that region.

798
00:49:42,411 --> 00:49:47,360
And that differs a lot from um,
central and southern Europe for example.

799
00:49:47,361 --> 00:49:47,661
I mean,

800
00:49:47,661 --> 00:49:52,220
it's very easy to go to Spain and go to
a restaurant and find something that's

801
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,740
definitely a bit adapted to
the world of restaurants.

802
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:59,030
But that fairly accurately represents
the same thing as you would

803
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:03,760
cook at home. Yeah. The question also,

804
00:50:03,761 --> 00:50:05,520
is there any tradition of high altitude,

805
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:12,880
uh, we don't have that much high
altitude in the Nordic region and,

806
00:50:12,881 --> 00:50:17,220
and where are we have a bit of altitude.
Uh, I mean, in Sweden, I mean the, like,

807
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:21,930
the tallest mountains are like 1500
or so meters and no one lives there.

808
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:26,490
I mean, traditionally has no one lived up
there. It's like we're, we're, I'm from,

809
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:31,520
uh, which is considered quite
high in altitude, is 350 meters.

810
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:36,560
So, uh, so I don't have a specific,
uh, any specific knowledge of it.

811
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:40,130
I know that we had some feedback from
like recipe test or something in Mexico

812
00:50:40,131 --> 00:50:43,310
City, for example. Uh, that a lot of
the recipes behave very differently.

813
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,590
Thank you guys for coming in
today and thanks for [inaudible].

814
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:50,790
[inaudible].
