1
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,330
Wonderful, wonderful to see all of
you are mostly unfamiliar faces,

2
00:00:14,331 --> 00:00:17,140
a few familiar ones. Uh, and that's great.

3
00:00:17,141 --> 00:00:20,690
It's just really nice to see a lot of
not people say, oh, it's, you know,

4
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,570
it's him again,
a lot of people for whom this,

5
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:28,070
some of these ideas and certainly the
content of our new book is going to be a

6
00:00:28,071 --> 00:00:28,731
fresh and new.

7
00:00:28,731 --> 00:00:32,000
So I want to put it all into context
for you and then we're all going to die

8
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:36,350
then. So we think about
marketing, we think about what,
what people say about it,

9
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,320
what people do about it.
And it's this,

10
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:44,000
and it's very troubling because
so much, uh, you know, when,

11
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:48,350
when we talk about marketing,
we talk about the stuff that marketers do.

12
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,530
We obsess over action.
Okay.

13
00:00:51,531 --> 00:00:54,140
It's just all these tactical
kinds of things out there,

14
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,440
but very often lost in the
conversation is who we do it too.

15
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:04,730
Or I'd rather say who we do it with it,
it's almost an afterthought.

16
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:09,310
We have all of these shiny objects,
many of which were invented and, and,

17
00:01:09,311 --> 00:01:13,410
and promoted right through to this, this
company here. And we're just, you know,

18
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:17,360
out there playing with toys. And I
always found that very troubling, uh,

19
00:01:17,361 --> 00:01:21,640
at for kind of obvious reasons as well
as some subtle ones that we really want

20
00:01:21,641 --> 00:01:25,100
to spend a little bit more
time thinking about them.

21
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:30,580
And that motivated the first book that
I wrote back in 2012 and it was really

22
00:01:31,101 --> 00:01:35,630
nice to kind of get people to focus a
little bit more on the whole customer

23
00:01:35,631 --> 00:01:40,580
thing. I, and it was, it was a very nice
success. We sold over 30,000 copies of it.

24
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,360
Um, but even then it didn't
quite do the job. You see,

25
00:01:44,361 --> 00:01:47,510
the problem is the too many
people would read the title,

26
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:51,380
they wouldn't read the subtitle, they'd
read the title and then say, Aha,

27
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,510
I know exactly what you're talking about.

28
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,660
And I fully agree it's all about this.

29
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:02,180
We put the customer at the
center of everything we do.

30
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,950
And that just kills me because
that's not what we're talking about.

31
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:10,250
And maybe it's my fault for
choosing a really bad title,

32
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,160
but it's really less about the customer.

33
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,240
And it's more about an appreciation of
this wide variety of customers and which

34
00:02:17,241 --> 00:02:20,300
ones, the ones we really do
want to focus on. So again,

35
00:02:20,301 --> 00:02:23,570
the book was a nice way
to start the conversation,

36
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:28,190
but I spent so much of my time talking
about what I don't mean by customer

37
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:29,024
centricity.

38
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:33,950
And one thing I surely don't mean is
that the customer is always right and we

39
00:02:33,951 --> 00:02:35,300
will do anything for you.

40
00:02:35,301 --> 00:02:40,010
We're going to hire an army of Ninjas
to make sure that every need you have is

41
00:02:40,011 --> 00:02:43,310
met. Every problem you have is solved.
That's not what I'm talking about.

42
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,950
But I'm also not talking about
the opposite ends of the spectrum,

43
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:49,580
which is we've got the customers we want,
we've got the customers who don't want,

44
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:53,540
let's get rid of them. Life will be much
easier. Okay. That, that has problems too.

45
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:56,210
And I can, I don't want to go into
the details. If you want, you can,

46
00:02:56,211 --> 00:02:59,150
you can pick up the old book.
And then maybe the main,

47
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:04,000
and the whole reason I wrote the book to
go back to the research that I do is to

48
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:08,680
get people to get companies
to stop focusing on the
past and spent a little bit

49
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:10,510
more time obsessing over the future.

50
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,390
So instead of focusing on
historic profitability,

51
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,780
let's think about this idea
of customer lifetime value.

52
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,110
And is it fair to say
that every one of you,

53
00:03:20,111 --> 00:03:24,430
whether you're working with these models,
are not at least has those letters,

54
00:03:24,431 --> 00:03:28,510
whether they're cov or LTV as, as part
of your, your vocabulary, you know,

55
00:03:28,511 --> 00:03:31,960
you're at least conversant with the bait
that that by itself is a really great

56
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:32,900
thing.
So,

57
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:36,460
so part of it is overcoming myths and
misconceptions about what we mean by

58
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:40,090
customer centricity. And part of it is
we just didn't go far enough with it.

59
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,960
That book was all about definition.
It was all about motivation.

60
00:03:43,961 --> 00:03:45,550
It was all about aspiration.

61
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,090
It was just kind of laying out just a
vision of what the world could look like.

62
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,330
If we had a magic wand and could
wave it over each customer's head,

63
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,830
but it kind of stopped short of specifics.
Uh,

64
00:03:55,831 --> 00:03:59,050
and so that's really where we want to go.

65
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,150
So how do we really do this stuff?
How do we communicate it internally,

66
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:07,450
externally, and how do we demonstrate
that it's actually worthwhile?

67
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:10,900
Or is it just another marketing
flavor of the month kind of thing.

68
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:14,650
And it too will pass.
We don't believe that at all.

69
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,760
And so we really wanted to find ways to
really move this conversation forward.

70
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:23,020
Again, not just in terms of definitions
and motivations, but in terms of actions.

71
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,280
And so, uh, so Sarah Tom's enters
the picture because, um, uh,

72
00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:31,420
she and I developed this really
great customer centricity simulation.

73
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:33,640
A lot of you have done some kind
of business simulation game.

74
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:37,720
We have the product and let's figure out,
you know, with the product, you know,

75
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:39,910
which segments that we're going to sell
it to and how much money we're going to

76
00:04:39,911 --> 00:04:43,420
spend it on the product. And it gets
back to all that marketing mix, four P's,

77
00:04:43,421 --> 00:04:44,770
tactical kind of stuff.
Well,

78
00:04:44,771 --> 00:04:47,680
how about a simulation where it's
your job to grow is profitable,

79
00:04:47,681 --> 00:04:52,330
a customer base as possible. The product
is secondary, the customers are primary.

80
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,840
So that really helped up. That started
to, to move the conversation along,

81
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:01,390
but there's still a lot of room to go
there. We're trying every possible thing,

82
00:05:01,391 --> 00:05:05,800
but we just need kind of broader
and deeper adoption across firms.

83
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,950
And I look at all the different reasons
why people start to think about this

84
00:05:08,951 --> 00:05:10,690
stuff. Is it, hey,

85
00:05:10,691 --> 00:05:15,190
we can make more money if we have our
CLV magic wand and we allocate our

86
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:19,690
resources appropriately. Or is it,
hey, nothing else is working for us.

87
00:05:19,691 --> 00:05:23,530
And out of sheer desperation,
what the hell? We'll try that too.

88
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:29,010
Whatever the reason we need to find a
way and we need to find a metaphor to try

89
00:05:29,951 --> 00:05:32,410
to get people on board with this stuff.

90
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,290
And so all the time I'm just
thinking about, you know,

91
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:38,680
tools and models and
simulations and stuff like that.

92
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:42,820
Sarah Tom's enters the picture
literally and figuratively, uh, to,

93
00:05:42,821 --> 00:05:47,200
to give us a really nice way to kind of
take the conversation to a higher level.

94
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:51,130
Exactly. So when Pete and I
were writing this book together,

95
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,730
a lot of our conversation was about
the call to action that we wanted to

96
00:05:54,731 --> 00:05:57,980
generate around customer centricity.
And when

97
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,210
you think about this opportunity and
desperation that really is mounting in the

98
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:04,510
marketing and sales field,
it really,

99
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,810
it reminded me of what happened in the
mid nineties in software development.

100
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,860
So I entered the tech
field in the mid nineties,

101
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,770
the dawn of.com.
A really,

102
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:18,590
really a wonderful time
to be an entrepreneur.

103
00:06:18,591 --> 00:06:23,420
I started my first tech company and like
most entrepreneurs entering technology

104
00:06:23,421 --> 00:06:27,230
at the time was incredibly
opportunity, uh, um, uh,

105
00:06:27,231 --> 00:06:29,540
excited and ready for the challenge.

106
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,960
The problem was in reality when I started
working with my clients is that the

107
00:06:35,211 --> 00:06:38,390
first thing I would be asked
for is a lot of documentation.

108
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,760
I was following the waterfall process.

109
00:06:40,761 --> 00:06:44,120
Like I was being told to my
tech team was really, uh,

110
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:47,570
not able to deliver in
the same way and to the,

111
00:06:47,571 --> 00:06:50,600
the objectives of what we were
trying to do as a business.

112
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:55,910
And one of the problems was
with a technology at the
time was we were following

113
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:00,890
old processes that were quite literally
decades old. They were not fast,

114
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,390
they were not agile.

115
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:06,410
And they were really being dictated
to us by bureaucracy such as the u s

116
00:07:06,411 --> 00:07:10,220
government, who at the time was
the largest developer of software.

117
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:14,530
So a great example of this,
when the space shuttle went, uh,

118
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,490
into the stratosphere in 1982,

119
00:07:16,491 --> 00:07:19,850
it had technology on board that
was quite literally from the 60s.

120
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:25,010
Software took sometimes between
six and a two decades to deliver.

121
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:30,610
And what that led to was the software
development crisis in the 1990s.

122
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:34,850
So this is where hardware
pcs were sitting on desktops.

123
00:07:34,851 --> 00:07:38,840
They were moving into homes and software
quite literally could not keep up.

124
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:44,660
So what we saw here is this timeline
where there were a few rogue software

125
00:07:44,661 --> 00:07:47,480
development teams who were like,
this gotta be a better way.

126
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,960
They were probably looking at Deming
and what he was doing with the iterative

127
00:07:50,961 --> 00:07:53,990
processes and quality
assurance and in manufacturing,

128
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,710
which was more of an iterative approach,
a more lightweight approach.

129
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,510
And what really started to happen with
these pioneers in technology was they

130
00:08:02,511 --> 00:08:07,100
decided that it was time to all come
together to draw a line in the sand or the

131
00:08:07,101 --> 00:08:10,040
snow because they all came
together in a snowbird,

132
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:15,041
Utah in 2001 and they decided to declare
their independence from the old ways of

133
00:08:15,831 --> 00:08:19,130
doing software.
And here you have the agile manifesto,

134
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:22,990
which was written in 2001
now it's kind of quirky and,

135
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,010
and this is still the
website today by the way.

136
00:08:25,011 --> 00:08:30,011
It looks still very 1996 or 2001 they
wrote a clear definition for a vision and

137
00:08:33,861 --> 00:08:36,680
what needed to be done in
software in particular.

138
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:41,800
And what was the way forward for how
to develop a way that would be lean,

139
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,720
a way that would bring the,

140
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:47,990
the customer or the user to the center
of the design a way that was more

141
00:08:47,991 --> 00:08:52,220
iterative so that they could course
correct and most importantly so that they

142
00:08:52,221 --> 00:08:53,720
could communicate with one another.

143
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,000
And also with the business
stakeholders who would, you know,

144
00:08:57,001 --> 00:08:58,560
software is being developed for.

145
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,720
And this was an amazing time for all of
us who are in software at the time when

146
00:09:03,721 --> 00:09:08,490
we saw this manifesto come to life and
when we started to see it being adopted.

147
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,360
So stupid question really did agile work,

148
00:09:12,361 --> 00:09:15,270
you guys are all looking at me
like of course it did sir. Um,

149
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:20,300
so here's some study information from a
Gartner study and other global studies

150
00:09:20,431 --> 00:09:24,510
that have been done on agile in 2018.
No surprise here,

151
00:09:24,511 --> 00:09:28,860
97% of organizations have adopted even
a small amount of agile within their

152
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:29,730
organization.

153
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:34,780
What we really love for Pete and I are
really excited about is this down here is

154
00:09:34,781 --> 00:09:38,640
that is no longer just a
software process or approach.

155
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,750
It's now being adopted by financial teams,
by middle management teams.

156
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,540
It's been adopted as
a way by lean startup.

157
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:50,010
It's been adopted as a way
forward to deliver great stuff.

158
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,530
It is product centric.
I will admit that as well.

159
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:57,530
And of course I had to put some Google
search results also in these Gartner

160
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:01,170
studies.
When agile projects are implemented,

161
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:04,200
they're three times more
successful for complex projects,

162
00:10:04,201 --> 00:10:08,130
six times more successful.
So clearly this was the right way to go.

163
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:12,490
What you see here with
these adoption curves, uh,

164
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:17,280
since the 19 hundreds and what if any
of you have been in a marketing class or

165
00:10:17,281 --> 00:10:20,190
in a business class?
What you're seeing is they're speeding up.

166
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,950
Adoption is faster, right? Here
is where the manifesto happened.

167
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:29,070
And for a lot of you you're probably
thinking, well, it's just, you know,

168
00:10:29,071 --> 00:10:31,830
processing powers better,
we're getting better at tech.

169
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,720
But what I actually believe,

170
00:10:33,721 --> 00:10:37,080
somebody who's been in the technology
sphere now for over 20 years,

171
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,060
it's really been this, this shift in
how we, we create technology together.

172
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,950
And I believe that the agile manifesto
was that sort of ignition point,

173
00:10:46,951 --> 00:10:50,970
that it was that tipping point that
allowed us to be able to support the

174
00:10:50,971 --> 00:10:54,180
innovation and now the adoption
that has gone along with it.

175
00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:01,150
So let's take that real story and now
use it as a metaphor for kind of the data

176
00:11:01,641 --> 00:11:03,410
analytics customer centricity thing.

177
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,400
Cause right now a lot of companies
believe that we're on the verge of another

178
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:11,510
tipping point because we have so much
data, we have so much computing power.

179
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:15,260
We have so much analytical capabilities
that would just going to combine all

180
00:11:15,261 --> 00:11:19,130
this stuff together and money is just
going to come raining down from the sky.

181
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:22,610
We're going to see the same kind of
just break through in terms of success,

182
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:26,720
not in terms of hard goods or,
or you know, or, or, or services.

183
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:31,460
But in terms of just our, our
analytical and customer centric smarts,

184
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,590
while it's not going to happen,
uh,

185
00:11:33,591 --> 00:11:35,840
and I've really learned that
the hard way because again,

186
00:11:35,841 --> 00:11:38,120
for years and years and years I've
been going to companies and saying,

187
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,820
here's the CLV model.
Please use it.

188
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,280
And not only was it hard
to get adoption on it,

189
00:11:43,281 --> 00:11:47,240
but even when companies would adopt it,
so how do we make money on it?

190
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:52,630
So I really believe it's less about the
ingredients and more about the process.

191
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,310
And so staying with this metaphor where
it would kind of talking about how do we

192
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,070
make that process go better?

193
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:04,540
And so we've had all these conversations
very often around the sim and so on.

194
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:09,040
And so, you know, you know, how do
we get that overall call to action?

195
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:12,520
And of course it's up to sour times
to come up with the right answer.

196
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,920
Let's create our own manifesto.
And so I'm very pleased, very,

197
00:12:18,921 --> 00:12:22,330
very pleased to present
for the very first time to,

198
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,190
to an audience here in the
u s are you ready for it?

199
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:26,963
Please?

200
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,140
Good enough.
The

201
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,310
customer centricity manifesto.

202
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:38,340
So literally taking a
page out of their book,

203
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:41,540
making it just a little
bit prettier, um, and, and,

204
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:45,810
and basically coming up with an organizing
set of principles and then underlying

205
00:12:45,811 --> 00:12:47,490
specific tactical practices,

206
00:12:47,491 --> 00:12:50,820
which is what we're going to talk
about with you this afternoon to say,

207
00:12:50,821 --> 00:12:52,620
let's all agree on this.

208
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:57,830
Let's make this happen and let's figure
out both how to get buy in internally as

209
00:12:58,621 --> 00:13:01,530
well as externally.
So we spent a bunch of time,

210
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,950
and I'll be super honest with you,
we basically had this sim,

211
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:08,400
we put together a basically
a software manual.

212
00:13:08,401 --> 00:13:11,490
We'll just to kind of help people play
the game. We said, that's not enough.

213
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,160
We want to help them play
the game smarter. And again,

214
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:17,420
we realized it was more than just
saying, here's how you calculate Cov. Um,

215
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:21,280
it was more about the mindset that
you're going to take on when you approach

216
00:13:21,281 --> 00:13:23,910
this kind of exercise, whether it's
simulator or whether it's real.

217
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:24,990
If you're interested,

218
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:30,170
you can go to customer
centricity manifesto.org
signed the manifesto show that

219
00:13:30,361 --> 00:13:30,931
you agree,

220
00:13:30,931 --> 00:13:34,200
spread the Gospel about it and that's
what we want to talk about is to basically

221
00:13:34,201 --> 00:13:39,201
take each one of these four principles
over here and just bring it to life.

222
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,130
So let's start with this
first one right here.

223
00:13:41,131 --> 00:13:46,131
The idea of we're going to
really celebrate customer
heterogeneity over averages

224
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:52,920
so you know when you start thinking about,
okay, all right, all right, I got ya.

225
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,720
Customers are different from each other.

226
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:59,310
What immediately comes to mind is that
that that pain and suffering that you

227
00:13:59,311 --> 00:14:03,240
went through in your introductory
statistics course where that professor and

228
00:14:03,241 --> 00:14:05,460
pretty much every
professors since then said,

229
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:09,390
everything follows a normal
distribution and so stands to reason.

230
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:11,100
That would be the same
thing with your customers.

231
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:14,220
They're going to get this nice
symmetric mix. You've got the good ones,

232
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:15,480
he got the not so good ones.

233
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,140
You got this big lump in the middle
and depending on just how it's shaped,

234
00:14:19,141 --> 00:14:19,771
you might say,
you know,

235
00:14:19,771 --> 00:14:23,520
there's so many over here that we
really can focus on the average.

236
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,570
Well the problem is this never happens.

237
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,530
That's just not true. And it's something
that I've known for quite some time,

238
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:32,730
but it really,

239
00:14:32,731 --> 00:14:36,960
really crystallized are through my first
startup company called Zodiac that some

240
00:14:36,961 --> 00:14:39,930
of you might be familiar with. Don't
Google it now cause it's gone. I'll,

241
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,060
I'll tell you why.
Uh,

242
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:45,000
and basically what we were doing is
we were working with lots of different

243
00:14:45,001 --> 00:14:48,690
companies, wonderful variety of
companies, products and services, B,

244
00:14:48,691 --> 00:14:52,250
two B and B to c, domestic and
international, big and small.

245
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,440
And we'd would just calculate the COVs
and say, here you go, now go make money.

246
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:02,090
And the distribution of COVs that we'd
see would pretty much always look like

247
00:15:02,091 --> 00:15:06,800
this. Very much not normal. And
it's not only that it's not normal,

248
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,130
but it also gives you a lot of
specific advice and direction.

249
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,770
Like who are these customers over here?

250
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,230
What makes them different
from everybody else?

251
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:20,090
And how can we find more like them? That's
what customer centricity is all about.

252
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:24,260
And so recognizing the nature of this
distribution is really critical to kind of

253
00:15:24,261 --> 00:15:28,250
drive you in that direction and hopefully
motivate you to look for this kind of

254
00:15:28,251 --> 00:15:31,520
stuff. And then of course,
act on it. Um, the, the,

255
00:15:31,521 --> 00:15:34,270
the bottom line on the Zodiac thing
for those of you don't know is, um, uh,

256
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,360
just a couple of months ago we actually
sold the company to Nike and now they're

257
00:15:38,361 --> 00:15:42,200
doing just an amazing, wonderful
things with CLV. You know, again,

258
00:15:42,201 --> 00:15:44,030
a company I used to be
very product centric,

259
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,830
but now doing just incredible things by,

260
00:15:46,831 --> 00:15:49,820
by understanding their customers and
doing all the stuff that we're talking

261
00:15:49,821 --> 00:15:54,170
about here. Kind of really nice story for
you. It's more than just distributions,

262
00:15:54,171 --> 00:15:55,400
it's more than just math.

263
00:15:55,490 --> 00:16:00,410
It's about how do we get other people
to celebrate customer heterogeneity did

264
00:16:00,411 --> 00:16:05,120
some work with a small B2B
manufacturer down in Norfolk, Virginia.

265
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,970
So kind of a very different
kind of company than,

266
00:16:07,971 --> 00:16:11,390
than a lot of companies that you would
think about when we're talking about CLV.

267
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:11,991
Uh,

268
00:16:11,991 --> 00:16:15,350
and the CEO found it very frustrating
that after I had this session and kind of

269
00:16:15,351 --> 00:16:18,680
get everyone all juiced up and
jazzed up about customer centricity,

270
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,370
that he listened to the conversations
that were taking place a day, a week,

271
00:16:22,371 --> 00:16:23,204
a month later,

272
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:28,660
and everyone was still talking about
the customer or the average customer.

273
00:16:29,151 --> 00:16:31,940
We found it frustrating. He said, tell
you what, this is what we're going to do.

274
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:36,890
So he put a fish bowl right there in
the company lunch room and he said,

275
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,450
I want all of you to listen.

276
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:43,220
I want all of you to police each other
at any time you hear a colleague referred

277
00:16:43,221 --> 00:16:47,620
to the customer in a singular manner
and they're not referring to a singular

278
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:50,000
customer. Anytime he'd be able
to just talk about the customer,

279
00:16:50,001 --> 00:16:53,270
the average customer, you
call him on it, say I got you.

280
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,490
And they have to put a
dollar in the fishbowl.

281
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:00,800
And it was a really fun way to get people
to really think about this one idea

282
00:17:00,801 --> 00:17:04,970
all the time. Nothing about tactical
execution, just the mindset.

283
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:09,140
And in no time at all.
They had a fish bowl filled with dollars,

284
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,450
very visible for everyone to see.

285
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:15,830
And at the end of the quarter or whenever
it was, the CEO said, you know what?

286
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:19,340
We're going to have a party now using
all that money and what is it that we're

287
00:17:19,341 --> 00:17:20,240
going to celebrate

288
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:28,140
customer heterogeneity? So it comes
full circle like that. And it's just a,

289
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,080
just a clever little way.

290
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:33,800
I want everyone to go out there and buy
a fish ball right now for yourself or

291
00:17:33,801 --> 00:17:37,400
for your clients. Um, but it's just
a clever little way to say, again,

292
00:17:37,401 --> 00:17:39,500
it's not just about geeky math stuff,

293
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,050
it's about figuring out how
to get that message across.

294
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,920
That's principle number one.
Let me hand things back to Sarah.

295
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:49,980
Let's keep on going. Okay, so friend,
customer heterogeneity. Principle

296
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,813
number two

297
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:56,850
is cross functional uses of
CLV over siloed applications.

298
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:00,720
So when Pete and I set out to write this
book, it was incredible. It was really,

299
00:18:00,721 --> 00:18:02,640
really important to us.
We didn't again,

300
00:18:02,641 --> 00:18:06,570
create something that's just going
to sit right in the marketing silo.

301
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:11,190
This is something that we need to ignite
conversations across the functional

302
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:13,920
areas. Uh, it's why when
you delve into the book,

303
00:18:13,921 --> 00:18:17,550
we have parts where we're talking about
how you engage with your technology

304
00:18:17,551 --> 00:18:20,670
teams and you talk about data,
how you work with finance,

305
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:24,870
how you work with the other
areas to really start to
get that conversation going.

306
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,970
Like, uh, Pete's last example,

307
00:18:26,971 --> 00:18:31,110
talking about making sure that folks
aren't thinking just about the customer.

308
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:35,520
So I want to do here is just share a
couple of really interesting examples.

309
00:18:35,521 --> 00:18:40,500
These are not examples in the
book brand new for you folks. Um,

310
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:44,250
batteries plus bulbs,
no prizes if you can guess what they sell.

311
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:48,960
So they have been, uh, they are
here in the United States. They are,

312
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:53,250
uh, the 700 us, excuse me, 700 stores.

313
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,380
And, um, they are just a
pretty usual hard goods,

314
00:18:58,381 --> 00:19:03,180
brick and mortar selling. What do
you think? Batteries and bulbs.

315
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,670
Exactly. Good job guys. So, um,

316
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:10,240
what I like about this example in Pete
and I both know the former, uh, head, uh,

317
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,480
chief customer analytics,

318
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:16,430
a gentleman and he has shared
with us some incredible, um,

319
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,880
evolution of the use of CLV within
their company. So they started small,

320
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,410
they started experimental,

321
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:27,300
and it's now grown into being a cross
functional experience for them when they

322
00:19:27,301 --> 00:19:28,320
think about their business,

323
00:19:28,321 --> 00:19:31,380
when they think about their customers
and how they engage with their customers

324
00:19:31,381 --> 00:19:36,060
in different ways based on CLV higher
value customers are gonna want to be

325
00:19:36,061 --> 00:19:39,210
engaged with differently than their
lower value customers, for example.

326
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,740
So when they have their, uh, customers
coming to them through their website,

327
00:19:43,741 --> 00:19:45,930
through their call centers,
through retail,

328
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:50,220
they have ways of capturing
that behavioral data.

329
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,600
So for example,

330
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:57,200
using a natural language
API that's collecting all of
this behavioral data about

331
00:19:58,171 --> 00:20:02,310
their customers and they know which
ones are going to behave a certain way,

332
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:06,180
are more likely to have higher value
versus which ones are behaving a certain

333
00:20:06,181 --> 00:20:09,180
way, are going to have lower
and middle, a tiered value.

334
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:14,040
And all that gets pumped up
every single day into salesforce.

335
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,830
And by the next day they've,

336
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:21,300
they've created lists sorted
by CLV for their sales force.

337
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,010
Those are now target lists that they can
go after and then they cycle back the

338
00:20:26,011 --> 00:20:30,030
performance of that,
those lists back to those various areas.

339
00:20:30,031 --> 00:20:33,060
And they improve on those
algorithms all the time.

340
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,320
So it's a nice iterative
process where they're,

341
00:20:35,321 --> 00:20:39,630
they're really leveraging CLV and
not just that the company's been very

342
00:20:39,631 --> 00:20:42,450
successful.
They're constantly expanding.

343
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:47,070
They're looking at mom and pop shops that
they can acquire and they use CLV for

344
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,160
that. That's one of their key indicators
for where are they going to go,

345
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:55,180
which store are they going to buy?
Which store are they going to put in?

346
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,700
Second,
really cool example.

347
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:03,980
Little bit more exciting maybe for some
of you than batteries and bulbs is um,

348
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,280
electronic arts. So gaming
company, we do actually, uh,

349
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:11,980
speak about sort of their origin
story as far as customer centricity.

350
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:13,780
They are very,
very mature.

351
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,270
And the customer centricity space as
far as how they are leveraging CLV and

352
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:23,260
their data analytics teams are actually
embedded into their gaming studios so

353
00:21:23,261 --> 00:21:25,150
that when they do game launches,

354
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:28,990
they're feeding back that
game data and those CLV data,

355
00:21:28,991 --> 00:21:33,580
real time to the studio
developers and letting them know,

356
00:21:33,581 --> 00:21:36,910
where are you successful
with this feature, where you
successful with this game,

357
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:41,500
et cetera. So last year in November,
they had command and conquer rivals,

358
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:45,220
which just launched and they knew that
they didn't know anything about really

359
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,170
their customer base when they launched.

360
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:52,360
And so they're advertising looked
like this. So this was November,

361
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,930
2018 you'll notice that we have a
pretty good, uh, gender representation.

362
00:21:56,170 --> 00:22:00,280
They're playing around with some
imagery as far as some of the, uh,

363
00:22:00,281 --> 00:22:03,940
the different weaponry, et
cetera. Fast forward one month,

364
00:22:03,941 --> 00:22:06,880
they're starting to collect initial
customer data and information.

365
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:12,430
By December, 2018 they've started to
make some small adaptations to that.

366
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:17,260
You can see it here. And then by
December, 2018 and then, sorry,

367
00:22:17,261 --> 00:22:20,920
by January,
2019 they realized something,

368
00:22:20,921 --> 00:22:25,450
they realized that who was bubbling to
the top as far as CLV where a teenage

369
00:22:25,451 --> 00:22:26,710
boys in North America.

370
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:32,100
So you'll see here women really have
fallen out of being represented in their

371
00:22:33,371 --> 00:22:37,240
ads. You'll also see that there's a lot
more left to right because of the left to

372
00:22:37,241 --> 00:22:40,240
right reading where the call to
action is, et Cetera, et cetera.

373
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:45,420
So this is another great
example of acquisition where
it CLV is being leveraged

374
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,690
to help guide the way.
Yeah.

375
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,470
But sometimes the best, uh, examples,

376
00:22:50,471 --> 00:22:53,830
it's not just getting smarter about
which kinds of customers to acquire it.

377
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:55,960
How much did you spend to do
so and where to find them.

378
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,300
But it's what do we do with
the existing customers?

379
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,160
Cause this has been kind of a,

380
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:05,020
a bit of a mass for a lot of companies
because companies know what to do with

381
00:23:05,021 --> 00:23:08,290
those existing customers when it comes
to trying to make them more valuable.

382
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:11,830
And they'll ask those two
great American questions,

383
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:15,340
which you all know so well.
Do you want fries with that?

384
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,540
And do you want to supersize it,
which of course we're using as accurate,

385
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:22,330
but kind of cutesy
versions are proxies for

386
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:28,000
what's that top on? Well, gotta
be careful about it, right?

387
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:31,450
That the top one is going
to be cross selling. People
who buy this also buy that.

388
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,100
And the bottom one will be upselling.

389
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,410
And the problem today is that this
is how we fattened up our customers,

390
00:23:38,411 --> 00:23:42,430
whether it's like what they're eating
or what we're presenting to them. Um,

391
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:44,500
and that's all companies know.

392
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:48,950
And so taking all of this technology
just to figure out how to cross sell and

393
00:23:48,951 --> 00:23:52,700
upsell better, faster, more
effectively, more thinking,

394
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,560
can we do better than that?

395
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:59,450
Can't we come up with just different
ways of kind of growing the value of

396
00:23:59,451 --> 00:24:02,270
customers are going to value
of the customer base. Um,

397
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:05,990
outside of just doing old school
stuff a little bit differently.

398
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:11,150
So we took a step back and rethought
about these kinds of tactics through the

399
00:24:11,151 --> 00:24:13,760
lens, through the mindset
of customer centricity.

400
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:17,870
And we came up with two dimensions.
They'll kind of obvious in hindsight,

401
00:24:17,871 --> 00:24:20,570
but they're just not, they don't
show up a lot in practice. Uh,

402
00:24:20,571 --> 00:24:25,571
the first dimension would be which
kinds of customers are we talking about?

403
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,930
Uh, either, uh, uh,

404
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:31,430
making more valuable or
just just holding onto that.

405
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:34,670
As Sarah has said and as
it's entirely obvious,

406
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:39,500
the kinds of tactics we use should vary
based on whether we're talking about

407
00:24:39,501 --> 00:24:41,090
really valuable customers or so.

408
00:24:41,091 --> 00:24:44,630
So ones that should be
explicitly taken into account,

409
00:24:44,631 --> 00:24:49,040
not just to say which kind of cross sell
message we're going to be using for you,

410
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:53,180
but what kind of overall tactic we
should be deploying different kinds of

411
00:24:53,181 --> 00:24:56,870
tactics for different kinds of
customers. That's number one. Number two,

412
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,930
when it comes to
retention and development,

413
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:03,020
you kind of get the basic
idea of the right way,

414
00:25:03,021 --> 00:25:06,350
which is development is let's take those
existing customers and make them more

415
00:25:06,351 --> 00:25:09,500
valuable. Retention is, let's
hold on to the customers we have,

416
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,030
but there's a lot of crossover,

417
00:25:11,031 --> 00:25:14,960
especially in the tactical execution of
those things where they kind of start to

418
00:25:14,961 --> 00:25:15,794
blur together.

419
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:20,330
We want to break it apart and make it
more explicit about what kind of strategic

420
00:25:20,331 --> 00:25:22,130
objective do we really have in mind?

421
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:27,200
Are we playing off fence or are
we playing defense? And again,

422
00:25:27,201 --> 00:25:30,380
for which kinds of customers.
So if you take these two dimensions,

423
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:34,790
you get what every marketing professor
is contractually obligated to share with

424
00:25:34,791 --> 00:25:37,280
you a two by two matrix.

425
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,420
And so basically we were trying to
come up with an overall are going to

426
00:25:41,421 --> 00:25:45,200
organizing framework that again,
from the customer centric standpoint,

427
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:50,380
we asked the question which kind of tactic
or are we gonna use at which time for

428
00:25:50,421 --> 00:25:53,960
which kinds of a strategic objective
and for which kinds of customers,

429
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:56,170
and I'm not going to take you
through the whole thing, but,

430
00:25:56,350 --> 00:26:00,800
but we just want to bring clarity, uh, not
only to which tactic going to use when,

431
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,400
but even what do we exactly mean by
these different kinds of tactics.

432
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:08,980
So just as one example, there's one
area over here. It's not your idea of,

433
00:26:08,981 --> 00:26:11,750
of premium offerings.
You've got these high value customers.

434
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,680
Don't give them a buy nine get one
free thing. I mean really you can't,

435
00:26:15,681 --> 00:26:18,920
you do better than that. These are
the people who, for whatever reason,

436
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:21,350
very strongly identify with you.

437
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:24,230
They like the products you sell that
like the way that you sell them.

438
00:26:24,231 --> 00:26:27,980
They resonate with the brand,
with the people for a variety of reasons.

439
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,890
These are the folks who are going to go
through the gates of hell to stay with

440
00:26:30,891 --> 00:26:34,730
you. And you know what? They don't mind
going even deeper into the relationship.

441
00:26:34,731 --> 00:26:37,070
They don't mind paying more,
not that you want to gouge them,

442
00:26:37,071 --> 00:26:38,750
you don't want to risk the relationship.

443
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:41,450
But lots of opportunities
starting with some of the,

444
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:44,760
the real well known ones
like linked in premium.

445
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:47,730
So how many of you are
linked in premium folks?

446
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:52,920
Raise your hand and proudly if you, if
you're a link in print, this is my point,

447
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:57,840
okay? It is a premium service.
It is not for everybody,

448
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:01,050
okay. But for those one or two
people who put their hands up,

449
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,300
linkedin means a great deal to you,
right?

450
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:06,300
And so there's lots of other companies
out there that have been a little bit too

451
00:27:06,301 --> 00:27:10,760
shy to do this. Um, uh, just, just, uh,

452
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,850
don't you think our president would
pay a premium to kind of, I'm just,

453
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,360
I'm just saying and I'm,
and I'm not joking about that.

454
00:27:18,361 --> 00:27:22,050
There's a lot of people out there,
myself included who actually would,

455
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,900
would happily pay whatever
it would be seven,

456
00:27:24,901 --> 00:27:29,790
$8 a month and to get extra value added
services that maybe they could justify

457
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:33,570
offering to everybody.
A recent example would be Lulu Lemon.

458
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:38,940
Lulu Lemon recently announced what the
press is calling a new loyalty program,

459
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,720
but it has a little twist to it because
you have to pay a bunch of money up

460
00:27:42,721 --> 00:27:47,070
front to be part of it. That's not a
loyalty program. That's a premium surface.

461
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,440
So let's bring clarity to what,

462
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:53,460
what label we're using on which tactic
and at what time we're using it.

463
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:57,720
And I'm not going to go into the rest of
the details here. Read the book. Page 44.

464
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,670
It's all right there. Um, but,

465
00:27:59,671 --> 00:28:03,450
but really using this as the lens to
look at a lot of the tactical things that

466
00:28:03,451 --> 00:28:04,320
companies are doing,

467
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,010
customer experience and just so many
other things that that are going on out

468
00:28:08,011 --> 00:28:11,700
there and where does it fit and
does it make sense to use it or not?

469
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:15,030
So that's just giving you kind
of the tip of the iceberg on,

470
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:19,830
on a broad variety of, of different kinds
of applications of all the CLD stuff.

471
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:23,790
And it's going to be, you know, more than
just your standard kinds of, you know,

472
00:28:23,791 --> 00:28:26,700
how much should we pay for the customer
kind of thing that there's much more to

473
00:28:26,701 --> 00:28:29,520
say. Point number three,
this one over here,

474
00:28:29,521 --> 00:28:32,280
we want companies to choose their
metrics very, very carefully. You see,

475
00:28:32,281 --> 00:28:36,000
the problem is very often even
companies that are kind of data driven,

476
00:28:36,001 --> 00:28:40,170
metric oriented or choosing the metrics
that reflect their strategic orientation,

477
00:28:40,171 --> 00:28:43,860
which means they're very much
focused on well, volume and cost.

478
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:49,110
And a really good example that might be
surprising to some of you just went over

479
00:28:49,111 --> 00:28:52,620
here.
People have this one over here.

480
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,370
So let's look at the world's
most valuable brands. Right?

481
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:59,420
And I can show this with pride over
here cause you know, the Google is,

482
00:28:59,421 --> 00:29:01,860
is towards the top of the list
and you know, people just like,

483
00:29:01,861 --> 00:29:03,420
I could just leave this up here,
you know,

484
00:29:03,421 --> 00:29:05,940
for the rest of our time you can
just stare out it quite happily.

485
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:09,520
But I actually have a bunch
of concerns about it. Uh,

486
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:12,600
I think they're very serious concerns
and I think that companies are just

487
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:17,010
obsessing over this kind of thing cause
it's kind of shiny and cool but it's not

488
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:20,070
aligned with customer centric thinking.
Now having said that,

489
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:23,880
I'm not throwing branding under the
bus branding still really important and

490
00:29:23,881 --> 00:29:26,280
that's what I want to do here.
I want to talk both about what are the,

491
00:29:26,281 --> 00:29:30,870
how should we be thinking about metrics
and what is the role of branding in the

492
00:29:30,871 --> 00:29:32,190
customer centric enterprise.

493
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:36,330
So what am I some of my concerns about
this idea of brand equity? Number one,

494
00:29:36,331 --> 00:29:39,870
I think there's kind of a bit of a
backwards causality thing going on.

495
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:44,710
Like Google was not near the top of the
list back in the late nineties it wasn't

496
00:29:44,711 --> 00:29:47,920
until it became a behemoth company
and then, Oh then you know,

497
00:29:47,921 --> 00:29:51,850
everyone knows the brand. It's top of
mind. Oh, lots of brand equity there.

498
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:55,390
So I think a lot of that brand
equity really just reflects volume.

499
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:58,000
Just the overall size of the company.
You know,

500
00:29:58,001 --> 00:29:59,520
you don't see anyone showing to you,

501
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:03,050
here's a chart of the companies
with the highest average customer,

502
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:05,290
customer lifetime value. You
know, you don't see that one.

503
00:30:05,291 --> 00:30:07,900
And that is what I want to
start to talk about. Okay.

504
00:30:07,901 --> 00:30:10,180
To kind of put those kinds
of metrics front and center.

505
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,640
And secondly is this point over here,

506
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:16,120
can we really measure brand equity
that with that kind of precision,

507
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,360
you could go back to that slide and you
see that they're measuring the value of

508
00:30:19,361 --> 00:30:22,180
the Google brand or apple or
whomever else with you know,

509
00:30:22,181 --> 00:30:23,890
six significant figures.

510
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:29,160
I defy you to find a single
chief financial officer on
the planet who would say,

511
00:30:29,321 --> 00:30:31,510
yeah, I buy that. I mean,

512
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:35,350
we'll all agree that the Google
brand is incredibly valuable.

513
00:30:35,351 --> 00:30:39,070
We'll all agree that the
brand and everything that
it stands for could well be

514
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:42,220
worth on the order of hundreds
of millions of dollars,

515
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,600
hundreds of billions of dollars.

516
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:47,650
But could we really specify at
the six or seven decimal places?

517
00:30:47,651 --> 00:30:50,950
I don't think so. So we have a
couple of objectives over here,

518
00:30:50,951 --> 00:30:54,220
which is to try to come up with metrics
that we really can trust that we really

519
00:30:54,221 --> 00:30:57,940
can share across the organization.
So there's a bunch of marketers,

520
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,320
a flattering themselves with it,

521
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:04,390
but also reflect more about customer
equity instead of brand equity. You know,

522
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:09,420
in my first book I had a picture to look
to kind of like this and it basically

523
00:31:09,491 --> 00:31:12,340
said, you know, customer
equity is not for everybody.

524
00:31:12,341 --> 00:31:14,620
There are some companies where
it's going to be hard to measure,

525
00:31:14,621 --> 00:31:16,150
it's going to be hard to leverage it.

526
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,670
And there's going to be other companies
out there that are just great at

527
00:31:18,671 --> 00:31:21,700
building, you know, terrific
brands, good for them. You know,

528
00:31:21,701 --> 00:31:24,640
there's fine let them be, they don't
have to do the customer centric thing.

529
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:27,880
But as time goes by,
as I have these conversations with,

530
00:31:27,881 --> 00:31:29,320
with lots and lots of executives,

531
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:34,120
kind of changing my tune on it because
I've come to realize that a lot of the

532
00:31:34,121 --> 00:31:35,500
things that could,

533
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:39,220
that that on the surface could lead
to a really strong brand but don't

534
00:31:39,221 --> 00:31:43,270
necessarily show up in customer equity.
I don't believe it.

535
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,460
But what are the kinds of things like,

536
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:48,430
oh we can go out there and
we can hire great employees,

537
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:52,300
we can get special tax breaks and
other privileges from government,

538
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:56,910
things that that don't necessarily show
up immediately as more customers buying

539
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:01,480
more stuff at higher margins. But if you
think about it over the long run view,

540
00:32:01,481 --> 00:32:03,160
which is kind of what we like to have.

541
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:08,290
So what if you can hire better
employees? Big Deal, good for you.

542
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:13,600
Unless those employees can help
you bring in more customers,

543
00:32:13,601 --> 00:32:17,830
will buy more often at higher margins.
There's no equity in it.

544
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:23,490
So pretty much all of the things that I
used to say belong over here really are

545
00:32:24,131 --> 00:32:26,680
subsumed by this.
And so the,

546
00:32:26,681 --> 00:32:31,270
the picture we have in the book now looks
a little bit more like this. Okay. And,

547
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:35,060
and so a couple of important
points about it. A number one,

548
00:32:35,061 --> 00:32:36,410
the customer equity is,

549
00:32:36,411 --> 00:32:40,550
is going to be a potentially larger
that it's going to subsume all of those

550
00:32:40,551 --> 00:32:44,540
elements of brand equity and just a lot
of the boring transactional stuff. Uh,

551
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:45,403
number two,

552
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,590
there could still be some aspects of
brand equity that we don't pick up.

553
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,820
It's just not going to be that much.

554
00:32:49,821 --> 00:32:52,100
Not going to be that
substantial but important.

555
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:57,130
Number three is that a huge chunk of the
customer equity will be associated with

556
00:32:58,011 --> 00:32:58,844
the brand.

557
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:04,210
Having an awesome brand will enable you
to acquire better customers a little bit

558
00:33:04,821 --> 00:33:08,600
more cheaply. It will enable you to hold
on to them a little bit longer with,

559
00:33:08,601 --> 00:33:11,840
with, uh, with lower cost
to keep them around. So, so,

560
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:16,870
so branding absolutely helps maintain
and magnify that customer equity.

561
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:21,020
It's just that you can't
measure it directly.

562
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:26,290
It's just folded in to all of the
stuff that shows up in lifetime value.

563
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:29,210
And so a lot of people read,

564
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:33,070
read my first book and kind of took me
as a brand hater, uh, that, you know,

565
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,680
he's against branding. No,
no, no, no, no. I just,

566
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:40,340
I'm just concerned about brand
measurement and the kind of the, and the,

567
00:33:40,341 --> 00:33:45,110
and the podium that we put it on. And
so the, the kind of happy middle ground,

568
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:50,240
uh, that I, and, and that's our have found
is this over here is that, as I said,

569
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,210
a branding is super hard
to measure by itself.

570
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:58,040
In many cases it's super hard to see the
specific effects that it will have on

571
00:33:58,041 --> 00:34:02,690
different customers. So let's not
try to do all of that measurement.

572
00:34:02,691 --> 00:34:04,100
It's just going to make us cool.

573
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:08,960
But it does show up in so many
ways and those are important ways.

574
00:34:08,961 --> 00:34:09,531
And so the,

575
00:34:09,531 --> 00:34:12,950
the metaphor that we'd like to use over
here is that branding is really the

576
00:34:12,951 --> 00:34:15,890
lubrication for the
customer's centricity engine.

577
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:20,810
So you can't do the customer centric
thing as well as possible unless you have

578
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:24,140
branding that's going to help
you do acquisition, retention,

579
00:34:24,141 --> 00:34:28,790
development employees, uh, and
all that stuff a lot better.

580
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,550
So it's important you
need to invest in it.

581
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,280
It's much harder to measure
the Roi on those investments.

582
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:35,620
And it might be for some,
you know,

583
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,820
kind of direct marketing
campaigns or something like that.

584
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:41,570
You need to run a lot of experimentation
to figure figure it out. Uh, but it,

585
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:46,580
so it's still there, but it's just an
overall component of customer equity.

586
00:34:46,581 --> 00:34:49,190
We just want to change the way that
people are thinking about those kinds of

587
00:34:49,191 --> 00:34:52,370
metrics. And a few are the metrics
to that are worth talking about.

588
00:34:52,371 --> 00:34:56,750
Some I'm sure you're quite
familiar with. MM, definitely. So

589
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:02,700
recognize the fact that it's not a new
idea thinking about your customers and

590
00:35:02,771 --> 00:35:06,220
different, you know, that they perform
differently, that they work differently.

591
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:11,380
This actually was first, uh,
from, uh, modern times anyway, uh,

592
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,810
launched in this book
by Frederick Reichheld.

593
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,270
So he's a bane consultant
principal at Bain,

594
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:19,540
and he wrote this book in 1996.

595
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:23,050
It's called the loyalty effect and
what he wanted to do in this book.

596
00:35:23,051 --> 00:35:26,830
It's really explain that
there's a mechanism, there's,

597
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:30,130
there's a way that
customers behave and really,

598
00:35:30,131 --> 00:35:34,860
instead of trying to push as much
product blindly to as many, you know,

599
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,610
faceless,
nameless customers,

600
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,580
well you really should be doing is looking
at the behaviors of your customers,

601
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:46,410
learning what those are and then working
to really reduce the friction in that

602
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:50,490
relationship. And what happens when you
reduce the friction in the relationship,

603
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:54,570
especially with your higher value
customers, is you grow their value.

604
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:58,440
And when you grow their value, you
reduce the costs that they, you know,

605
00:35:58,441 --> 00:36:02,490
they cost you to have as their
customers. And as you, uh,

606
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,410
reduce the costs,

607
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,890
you have this virtuous cycle start to
happen where the next thing you know,

608
00:36:07,891 --> 00:36:11,370
they see you as a trusted advisor and
they're going to start referring other

609
00:36:11,371 --> 00:36:14,250
customers to you.
So in this book,

610
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:19,370
he Reichheld really was aiming to just
describe that this mechanism exists.

611
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,260
It's different for different
types of customers.

612
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:27,420
And it was really that first seed
of an idea that I think was going to

613
00:36:27,421 --> 00:36:29,610
eventually lead to customer centricity.

614
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:35,580
So in his first book he was really
aiming to explain sort of the nature of

615
00:36:35,581 --> 00:36:40,470
customers. And then fast forward
to 2006 and he released this book,

616
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:44,250
the ultimate question and what he was
driving at in this book was really

617
00:36:44,251 --> 00:36:46,410
understanding how to measure that.

618
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:51,650
And so I'm sure you'll not be surprised
to see the measurement being net

619
00:36:51,841 --> 00:36:52,674
promoter score.

620
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:57,930
So I know that there are probably a lot
of detractors in here as far as nps goes.

621
00:36:57,931 --> 00:37:00,720
There definitely are some haters
and we want to recognize that.

622
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:05,100
But the reason Pete and I like this was
this was the first time nps really was

623
00:37:05,101 --> 00:37:10,101
one of the first times that it elevated
this idea of customer differences in

624
00:37:11,011 --> 00:37:14,940
sort of the, the, you know,
our, our business sense.

625
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:19,080
So let's look at nps through
a customer centric Lens.

626
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:23,130
So some of the reasons Pete
and I like a nps, number one,

627
00:37:23,131 --> 00:37:27,660
it celebrates a customer heterogeneity.
Number two,

628
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:31,290
it gives an elite status to the promoters.
So in the equation,

629
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:35,280
the promoters definitely happened
elite status. Third, it's simple.

630
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:38,310
It's an easy way to have a
conversation about, you know,

631
00:37:38,311 --> 00:37:41,670
your different customers
and it's an easy way to, uh,

632
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:46,470
really evaluate them and slice and
dice and look at them across different

633
00:37:46,471 --> 00:37:50,970
segments to really understand your
customers more. Now we, again,

634
00:37:50,971 --> 00:37:55,170
we recognize that, you know, nps
has been implemented blindly.

635
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,580
Pete and I would probably complain about
things like it's been implemented too

636
00:37:59,581 --> 00:38:02,390
narrowly. There are ways
that it could be, uh,

637
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:05,370
looked at beyond referral
and they're really,

638
00:38:05,371 --> 00:38:09,960
the biggest problem with nps is it
doesn't take into account value.

639
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:14,070
So it's missing a key component of
that relationship with the customer.

640
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,410
So this is a great step
in the right direction and
really understanding the, the,

641
00:38:20,411 --> 00:38:24,960
the interplay between nps and CLV
is, uh, is a great area of, of,

642
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:27,920
of research that's going
on right now. Uh, but it,

643
00:38:27,921 --> 00:38:29,840
it really does get to this idea that,
okay,

644
00:38:29,841 --> 00:38:33,740
it's one thing to come up with the right
metrics that reflect customer centric

645
00:38:33,741 --> 00:38:35,060
practices.
Uh,

646
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,840
but it's a whole nother thing to
figure out how to get 'em out there.

647
00:38:37,841 --> 00:38:42,070
So people believe you that you
really are doing this kind of stuff.

648
00:38:42,071 --> 00:38:43,420
And doing it well.
And you know what?

649
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:47,500
We understand that maybe you're not
maximizing your profits this quarter,

650
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:51,220
but by doing the right things and
in terms of customer centricity,

651
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:55,310
that is going to be so well worth
it in the long run. So, well,

652
00:38:55,311 --> 00:38:59,290
let me just go through this fourth
point with a very interesting and very

653
00:38:59,291 --> 00:39:03,970
contemporary case study. You all know
Wayfair online furniture company,

654
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:09,040
uh, as another good news and bad news
story. A first from Wayfair's perspective,

655
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:13,150
the good news,
look at those revenue numbers.

656
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:16,300
Everyone's dream come true.
That hockey stick,

657
00:39:16,301 --> 00:39:20,740
convex curve revenues through the roof.
My concern,

658
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:23,500
going back to point number three,

659
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,140
is that this just reflects overall volume.

660
00:39:26,141 --> 00:39:28,750
I want to know more about the
quality of those revenues.

661
00:39:28,751 --> 00:39:31,000
Instead of just saying how many
dollars are flowing in the door.

662
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:35,110
I want understand the nature
of the customers who are
bringing in those dollars.

663
00:39:35,111 --> 00:39:37,940
I mean,
you have to believe that a sale to a,

664
00:39:37,941 --> 00:39:42,310
to a new unproven customer is going to
be different in terms of lifetime value

665
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:43,910
enhanced then the,
the,

666
00:39:43,911 --> 00:39:47,380
the fourth sale to someone who's
been around with you before.

667
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:52,270
So let's peel that apart. And one of the
problems is with most companies, uh, it's,

668
00:39:52,271 --> 00:39:53,860
it's just impossible to do.

669
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:58,860
So how would you be able to take all of
this revenue and decompose it into the

670
00:39:59,141 --> 00:40:00,580
COVs?
Well,

671
00:40:00,581 --> 00:40:04,810
one of the things that he give Wayfair
a lot of credit for is that they make it

672
00:40:04,811 --> 00:40:08,620
easy. So if you look at that,
their own financial statements,

673
00:40:08,621 --> 00:40:11,110
this is a paper that I
wrote with Dan Mccarthy.

674
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,920
We're basically using data from
Wayfair and from another company,

675
00:40:14,921 --> 00:40:16,750
overstock.com that you might know,

676
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:20,020
that also reveals a lot of really
interesting metrics to the right kinds of

677
00:40:20,021 --> 00:40:23,890
metrics that are external stakeholders
want to see and should demand to see,

678
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:28,450
well, here's their data. So in addition
to giving us revenues, okay, fine,

679
00:40:28,451 --> 00:40:29,680
that's not surprising.

680
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,180
They give us a lot more metrics like how
many customers did we add this quarter?

681
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:36,640
Okay,
that's not that surprising.

682
00:40:36,641 --> 00:40:40,390
A lot of companies will give us that kind
of metric, but again, it's not required.

683
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:42,970
Accounting Standards Boards
don't say anything about that.

684
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:46,060
Some companies just voluntarily
choose to put that out there.

685
00:40:46,061 --> 00:40:47,710
This might help you
understand this better,

686
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,860
but it's the other two metrics
that really make them unique.

687
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:55,930
You can see him right here. One of them
is Cutie Oh quarterly total orders.

688
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:59,950
They are telling us how many orders
are being placed on their website every

689
00:40:59,951 --> 00:41:04,270
quarter. This is all public data
and the last one over here, a you.

690
00:41:04,271 --> 00:41:07,030
I bet you can guess what
that is. What is Aa? You

691
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:13,150
annual active users.
Again,

692
00:41:13,151 --> 00:41:17,800
I take your silence as a, as a sign
that we have a long way to go here.

693
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:22,870
We really want to make these kinds of
metrics part of the everyday vocabulary

694
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:26,620
and we're not just waiting for some
companies to charitably provide them to us

695
00:41:26,621 --> 00:41:30,310
for reasons I don't even understand,
but for investors, for analysts,

696
00:41:30,311 --> 00:41:34,970
from marketing professionals to demand
them so we can really understand how

697
00:41:34,971 --> 00:41:37,850
those dollars are working.
Here's the cool part about it.

698
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,760
You give me these metrics or you
can give him to Dan Mccarthy.

699
00:41:40,761 --> 00:41:45,710
This was part of his dissertation and I
can peel back the onion and look at the

700
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:46,840
nature of heterogeneity.

701
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:51,860
This company almost as accurately as
if I had the raw transaction log data.

702
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,400
Now for Wayfair, I don't, and
they're not going to give it to me.

703
00:41:55,401 --> 00:41:58,230
They don't like me very much
over there. You'll see why. Um,

704
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:00,470
but that's what we're going to do is we,
instead of just saying,

705
00:42:00,471 --> 00:42:03,860
here's revenue today, this is what
revenue is going to be tomorrow.

706
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,610
We're going to peel it all back and
let's understand the components,

707
00:42:07,611 --> 00:42:11,060
the customer centric components
of revenue. So that's forecast.

708
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:13,190
How many customers will we acquire?

709
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:16,280
How long will those
customers stay with us?

710
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,600
How many transactions will they make
over that horizon and how valuable will

711
00:42:20,601 --> 00:42:24,830
those transactions be? I hope you agree
with me on two things. Number one,

712
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,350
those would be really good things to know.
Again,

713
00:42:27,351 --> 00:42:30,860
as an outside evaluator of
the farm, you've got to tell
me that. And number two,

714
00:42:30,861 --> 00:42:33,860
have you add all that stuff up?
That's revenue.

715
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:36,680
So we're going to come in
revenue from the bottom up.

716
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:40,370
So we're going to take all of this data,
these columns that you see over here,

717
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:44,990
and we're going to model it through may
of 2017 and we're going to show how well

718
00:42:44,991 --> 00:42:47,300
we can capture all of these patterns.

719
00:42:47,301 --> 00:42:50,360
So here's how many customers we've had
and here's the total orders down here is

720
00:42:50,361 --> 00:42:55,010
revenue. But I want to emphasize that
we're not modeling revenue directly.

721
00:42:55,011 --> 00:42:58,550
That's what the people on Wall Street
do. Where modeling, here we go again,

722
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,250
how many customers are going to acquire,
how long are they gonna stay,

723
00:43:01,251 --> 00:43:02,480
how many transactions are going to make,

724
00:43:02,481 --> 00:43:04,250
how valuable that will
those transactions B,

725
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:08,990
and then combining it all together to say
that's what we think revenue is. Okay,

726
00:43:08,991 --> 00:43:11,150
so we're, we're, we're deriving this,

727
00:43:11,151 --> 00:43:14,300
we're not modeling it directly and we're
doing a pretty good job of it gives you

728
00:43:14,301 --> 00:43:17,180
a good feeling in the belly
that we could take this curve.

729
00:43:17,181 --> 00:43:20,870
We can take these underlying components
and project them out into the future and

730
00:43:20,871 --> 00:43:22,550
we can project them out pretty far.

731
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:25,550
Then we can do a little bit of accounting
stuff to turn it into an overall

732
00:43:25,551 --> 00:43:29,330
corporate valuation. So that's what
we're going to do. So on the next slide,

733
00:43:29,331 --> 00:43:33,050
I want to point out two things before I
had to dazzle you with it. Number one,

734
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:35,970
we're going to start with this curve
over here. We're going to say, all right,

735
00:43:35,971 --> 00:43:39,890
hey look, we've captured revenue
through may of 2017 let's go beyond it.

736
00:43:39,891 --> 00:43:42,950
So you're going to see that curve all
compressed and at 50 years to the right of

737
00:43:42,951 --> 00:43:46,100
it if the projected years.
Number two,

738
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:48,470
we recognize that not
all models are perfect,

739
00:43:48,471 --> 00:43:50,660
it's just that some suck less than others.

740
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:54,020
And so we're going to acknowledge that
there could be errors in each one of our

741
00:43:54,021 --> 00:43:57,470
models. So we allow for each one of
our curves to be slightly different.

742
00:43:57,471 --> 00:44:00,380
So I'm going to show you several
hundred maybe several thousand different

743
00:44:00,381 --> 00:44:04,970
trajectories that Wayfair's revenue
could take on. And here it is.

744
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:06,321
There's the,

745
00:44:06,321 --> 00:44:10,580
there's the revenues through middle
of 2017 and there a very bleak future.

746
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:11,451
Again,

747
00:44:11,451 --> 00:44:14,990
I give this company a lot of credit for
successes to date and for the metrics

748
00:44:14,991 --> 00:44:15,824
that they share,

749
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:19,970
but it is not a pretty picture that
acquisitions and growing too fast and too

750
00:44:19,971 --> 00:44:24,320
expensive. Lee, they're acquiring a lot
of very bad customers and they're not,

751
00:44:24,321 --> 00:44:28,220
they haven't established enough of
a base of repeat buying that when

752
00:44:28,221 --> 00:44:32,460
acquisitions level off,
which they will do,

753
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:37,440
they must usually what happens with
most companies when acquisitions peak,

754
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:41,250
there's enough established base of
ongoing repeat buying that you don't even

755
00:44:41,251 --> 00:44:46,050
notice it. I mean, did you even notice
when Amazon's acquisitions peaked? Nah,

756
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:49,050
because the repeat buying was
so high that it was all good.

757
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:50,520
This company will crash.

758
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:55,350
It might crash this year as some retail
experts are saying in my crash and I

759
00:44:55,351 --> 00:44:58,350
don't know, our best guess is sometime
in the mid 20 twenty's, I don't know,

760
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,270
but they're, they're, they're,

761
00:45:00,271 --> 00:45:03,270
they're just imbalanced and
their allocations and well,

762
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:06,870
let's take each one of these numbers
and turn it into evaluation. Here we go.

763
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:12,150
And May of 2017 the company
was trading for $65 a share.

764
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:14,340
We come up with a main stock price of 10

765
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:19,230
and where? Right. Well time will tell.

766
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:25,530
Interesting to see that there's the simple
academic paper had quite an impact on

767
00:45:25,531 --> 00:45:26,370
the stock price

768
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:32,250
in September of 2017 the stock was trading
in the mid eighties the day the paper

769
00:45:32,251 --> 00:45:32,800
came out,

770
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,560
wafer had the biggest drop in stock price
in a couple of years and it just kind

771
00:45:36,561 --> 00:45:39,660
of kept on going from there and it was
just really interesting to see the way

772
00:45:39,661 --> 00:45:44,440
that people picked up on it, including
our own Philly guy, Jim Kramer

773
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:46,550
say the poor think left.
He's totally into this one.

774
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:51,350
Struck again when he tweeted a support
of an academic paper published by

775
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:53,690
professors at Emory in the universe,
Pennsylvania,

776
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:56,450
Corey at the smartest piece
ever written on Wayfair.

777
00:45:57,050 --> 00:46:00,320
It did the job cost waiting for the
punch from 83 to seven years of today.

778
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:03,410
What was so devastating about
a high level academic paper.

779
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:07,580
The professors tried to come up with a
way to pin a value on Wayfair's current

780
00:46:07,581 --> 00:46:10,230
and future customers based
on how many I want to,

781
00:46:10,231 --> 00:46:14,510
how much they make from these customers
versus how much they spend to acquire

782
00:46:14,511 --> 00:46:15,344
them.

783
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:20,720
Let's think about this for a second.
Let me just kind of tone it down. Jim.

784
00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:26,330
The professors said that they're going
to figure out the value of the company by

785
00:46:26,331 --> 00:46:30,140
looking at the value of the customers
and the cost of acquisition.

786
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:31,700
Okay.

787
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:35,360
What's your reaction to that? I'll
tell you what your reaction should be.

788
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:37,820
Your actions should be,
Duh.

789
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:42,110
That's how every company should be valued.
Instead of is looking at this,

790
00:46:42,111 --> 00:46:44,870
this almost meaningless
overall revenue stream,

791
00:46:44,871 --> 00:46:47,390
let's decompose it into the
stuff that really matters.

792
00:46:47,391 --> 00:46:51,050
It really reflects what this company's
all about and build it up from there.

793
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:55,270
So that's the kind of thing that
I've been really pushing both. Uh,

794
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:58,850
I'm primarily as a way just to kind of
make the customer centric thing happened.

795
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:01,640
But here's my new startup.
If you're interested in this,

796
00:47:01,641 --> 00:47:02,780
and I'm not here to sell it,

797
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:06,650
but if you're interested in some of these
ideas about how we can revolutionize

798
00:47:06,651 --> 00:47:10,460
finance through customer base corporate
evaluation to basically take these

799
00:47:10,461 --> 00:47:15,050
principles of customer centricity and
bring them to a very different audience to

800
00:47:15,051 --> 00:47:18,560
get the CFO and the VP of investor
relations onboard as well.

801
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:22,580
So tell me more about those methods
and hey you guys in marketing,

802
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,670
you might want to see these models
over here. The kind of interesting,

803
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:29,060
that's the conversation that
I want to create a and so,

804
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:32,770
so good and I hope it's been so far,
so good for all of you as well.

805
00:47:32,771 --> 00:47:37,750
Those are our four principles of
our customer centricity manifesto.

806
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:40,480
Let me hand it over to Sarah to wrap
it up and then we'd love to get some

807
00:47:40,481 --> 00:47:41,280
questions from you.

808
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:45,390
Awesome. Thanks Pete. Okay,
so beyond the manifesto,

809
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:47,880
just some quick quick takeaways for you.

810
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:51,450
So we'd like you to join the
customer centricity revolution.

811
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,430
It's why we wrote the book.
We hope you'll read the book.

812
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:58,380
It's really little easy to carry around
in your pocket and a nice quick read.

813
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:00,780
Uh, but really our goal was, like I said,

814
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:06,020
is to distill these ideas and provide
that call to action and not be kind of in

815
00:48:06,991 --> 00:48:08,100
that academic sphere,

816
00:48:08,101 --> 00:48:13,050
although it really is grounded in academic
research and also business research.

817
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:17,820
But to really give a clear roadmap for
how to implement customer centricity in

818
00:48:17,821 --> 00:48:21,780
your organization. Second, we'd
love you to sign the manifesto.

819
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:25,380
Third, integrating, uh,

820
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,910
the essential frameworks that Pete and
I have been talking about here today.

821
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,240
Also in the book also, if you
Google Pete Fader, of course,

822
00:48:32,241 --> 00:48:34,580
there are plenty of other pieces where,

823
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:39,260
where he's providing advice that a would
be incredibly useful for you to follow

824
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:41,510
into your everyday business practice.

825
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:46,310
The one thing that I've found really
interesting in this journey of customer

826
00:48:46,311 --> 00:48:50,050
Centricity, I've had the opportunity
to interview a lot of folks, uh,

827
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,820
in the business world when we
were putting the book together.

828
00:48:52,821 --> 00:48:54,770
Pete and I are writing articles currently.

829
00:48:54,771 --> 00:48:59,480
Also putting this presentation together
is every single organization that I've

830
00:48:59,481 --> 00:49:03,890
spoken to who are now mature in customer
centricity, they all started small.

831
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:06,470
They all started with
teeny tiny experiments.

832
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:10,430
Often it was actually middle managers or
data scientists who had an inkling that

833
00:49:10,431 --> 00:49:14,590
something wasn't quite right and
there was ways to really define and,

834
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:18,860
and fine tune their strategies
around customer lifetime value.

835
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:22,640
When I talked to, uh, the
folks over at the La Dodgers,

836
00:49:22,641 --> 00:49:25,820
they actually made a lot of mistakes for
number of years when they were trying

837
00:49:25,821 --> 00:49:27,530
to experiment with CLV.

838
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:32,660
But those mistakes really have helped
them now where they are with their use of

839
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,850
um,
CLV and their business.

840
00:49:34,851 --> 00:49:39,200
So it's really interesting and this is
a key point is living at experimenting.

841
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:43,220
Our Call to action in the book has
really quite literally diving in and just

842
00:49:43,221 --> 00:49:47,470
start getting to work. And
the last but not least, um,

843
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:50,630
so I lead the simulation
team at the Wharton school.

844
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:53,840
The simulations really hold
a tremendous amount of power.

845
00:49:53,870 --> 00:49:57,260
They provide folks with an
opportunity to roll up their sleeves,

846
00:49:57,530 --> 00:49:59,600
think about something like a simulation,

847
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:04,590
a way to bring your teams together and
really experience what it's like, uh,

848
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:09,080
coming, becoming familiar with customer
centricity and laying out that roadmap.

849
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:11,133
Yeah.

850
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:15,680
And so when Pete and I reflect on sort
of where we've come from and where we're

851
00:50:15,681 --> 00:50:17,150
going,
you know,

852
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:22,490
we really hope that something like our
manifesto is really going to remove this

853
00:50:22,491 --> 00:50:27,140
question mark and we are going
to see customer lifetime value,

854
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:33,100
a common metric in every single business
and it will become a way to really

855
00:50:33,771 --> 00:50:37,820
drive this strategy forward. So I want
to thank everybody for coming today.

856
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:42,280
Do you have any closing remarks?
Beat? No, we'd love to get your quick,

857
00:50:42,281 --> 00:50:43,760
would love to get
questions. Yes, we would.

858
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:51,800
Alright,
go ahead.

859
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:56,520
Got a couple of microphones here.
What do y'all think? Huh? Please.

860
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:59,150
Thank you so much. That was
very, very interesting approach.

861
00:50:59,151 --> 00:51:01,250
We really appreciate it.
I do have a question.

862
00:51:01,251 --> 00:51:05,360
You mentioned the customer's interest
as intracity components of revenue.

863
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:06,620
Uh,

864
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:11,450
any advice that you can give us in terms
of how to lead those conversations with

865
00:51:11,451 --> 00:51:12,021
the customers?

866
00:51:12,021 --> 00:51:15,080
Given that we have so many variety of
them and their business models are very

867
00:51:15,081 --> 00:51:15,710
different,

868
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:20,710
what would be a couple of key questions
that we can ask our clients to identify

869
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:22,580
those components for them?

870
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:23,593
It's true.

871
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:28,430
I really have to say that moving
the conversation over to early,

872
00:51:28,431 --> 00:51:32,090
starting the conversation with the folks
in finance and then kind of backing

873
00:51:32,091 --> 00:51:36,710
into marketing has been incredible
to get that kind of a abroad by it.

874
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:38,120
And especially from an audience,

875
00:51:38,121 --> 00:51:42,320
it's not as afraid of of
models and forecasts and so
on. So here's the question.

876
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:46,010
Do you want to know what
your company's worth? I mean,

877
00:51:46,011 --> 00:51:51,011
it's as simple as that and most of the
time more working with private equity

878
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:56,000
firms, late stage vcs who are looking
at a company they want to acquire.

879
00:51:56,330 --> 00:52:00,020
But it becomes really interesting when
we're looking at a company and they just

880
00:52:00,021 --> 00:52:03,680
know internally that they're really worth
a lot more than the market seems to be

881
00:52:03,681 --> 00:52:07,340
saying. And they can't quite come
up with that rationale for it.

882
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:08,780
Still will turn to us to say,

883
00:52:08,781 --> 00:52:12,050
so what are we really worth in
terms of the value of our customers?

884
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:14,210
So they can come up with the number,

885
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:16,100
hopefully higher than
what Wall Street thinks.

886
00:52:16,101 --> 00:52:19,910
And then he'll make a whole big deal about
it. Not only that, the number's higher,

887
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:24,230
but to explain why that we've actually
been acquiring more customers that are

888
00:52:24,231 --> 00:52:26,150
staying around longer than you think.
And again,

889
00:52:26,151 --> 00:52:29,720
that translates directly
into the marketing, other
operational kinds of issues.

890
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:34,360
So I really think that that sometimes
starting on the finance side or maybe

891
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:34,851
doing that,

892
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:39,851
at least in parallel while you're doing
the less unusual but still difficult

893
00:52:40,251 --> 00:52:44,030
marketing tactics, uh, but
you know, bringing it all
together I think is a very,

894
00:52:44,031 --> 00:52:47,150
very convincing way to say that this,
this stuff's real.

895
00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:50,290
Thank you.
Questions.

896
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:57,190
Look, I'm in teaching mode
right now. I will cold call.

897
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,110
So please.

898
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:02,390
So I think if there was like
a, the, the anti book for this,

899
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,710
it would be how brands grow.
Are you rolling?

900
00:53:04,770 --> 00:53:05,640
No, no, no, no.

901
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:08,130
Yeah. So could you, could
you reconcile this does too.

902
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:12,170
I can. And of course I can get into
a pretty technical explanation of it,

903
00:53:12,171 --> 00:53:13,880
but I'll, I won't. Um,

904
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:17,840
if you don't know how brands grow by
Byron Trump actually highly recommended

905
00:53:17,841 --> 00:53:20,330
because he doesn't talk about
the models or anything like that.

906
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:23,180
But the models I'm talking about are very,
very,

907
00:53:23,181 --> 00:53:26,780
very similar to the models are
underlying a lot of his principles.

908
00:53:26,781 --> 00:53:29,400
So I actually agree with,
with most of what he's saying.

909
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:33,690
I agree with the idea that that when you
have that incremental dollar to spend,

910
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:37,650
Byron sharp says grow your base.
You must have more buyers.

911
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,840
I agree, but for a different reason,
I say let's focus more on acquisition.

912
00:53:42,841 --> 00:53:46,470
Let's go out there and find more valuable
customers and not worry so much about

913
00:53:46,471 --> 00:53:48,000
trying to fatten up the ones that we have.

914
00:53:48,001 --> 00:53:50,040
So it's actually a lot
of alignment with it.

915
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:52,150
Now there are some
differences and I have the,

916
00:53:52,151 --> 00:53:56,940
the ultimate love hate relationship with
Byron Sharp, uh, the, uh, that a bird.

917
00:53:57,030 --> 00:54:00,990
And just to kind of summarize the,
the, the biggest difference, um,

918
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:04,980
the Cov distribution that I show,
the fact that we got the, this,

919
00:54:04,981 --> 00:54:07,290
this tale of people out
there that kinda sticks out.

920
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:10,660
I was going to say like a sore
thumb, but a very healthy thumb. Um,

921
00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:15,000
he doesn't really believe in that.
Uh, he, he kind of believes that, uh,

922
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:17,460
it's not something he
believes in Heterogeneity,

923
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:21,430
but not that there's much as much
of, as kind of a skew to it. Uh,

924
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:23,400
as we see in the actual data.

925
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:28,210
So a lot of my career has been taking
the kinds of models that Byron Sharp and

926
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:32,460
other folks have been building and then
kind of adding slight little bells and

927
00:54:32,461 --> 00:54:36,840
whistles to them to kind of capture
reality a little bit better so that the

928
00:54:36,841 --> 00:54:41,490
basic fundamental principles,
double jeopardy, all that
kind of stuff, um, holds a,

929
00:54:41,491 --> 00:54:45,120
but there's actually more to it and then
it leads to, to other kinds of advice.

930
00:54:45,121 --> 00:54:46,500
So, so we're, we're actually,

931
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:49,200
it might seem surprising and I don't
blame you for thinking that way,

932
00:54:49,201 --> 00:54:51,890
but there's a surprising amount
of alignment. They're great.

933
00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:55,020
And I will even say that, you know,
as we were pulling those together,

934
00:54:55,021 --> 00:54:57,840
and I was going to try to
get Sarah into this world,

935
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:59,220
one of the early things that I did,

936
00:54:59,221 --> 00:55:02,830
maybe one of the first books I pulled
off the shelf was that red covered books.

937
00:55:02,831 --> 00:55:03,960
Say you gotta read this one too.

938
00:55:04,450 --> 00:55:09,040
Awesome. Thank you. Thank you. So we have
a question here from, I'm not sure where,

939
00:55:09,041 --> 00:55:10,400
but I'll read it.
Uh,

940
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:15,400
is Dov reserve relative to relatively
large companies with a lot of resources,

941
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:18,920
um, or is it applicable to small
companies as well? So Pete,

942
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:22,270
do you want to take a stab or you want
go for it? Flow. Okay. All right. So,

943
00:55:23,350 --> 00:55:26,010
so what we think here is that this is the,

944
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:28,780
these are universal principles for sure.
Um,

945
00:55:28,810 --> 00:55:31,870
when you're thinking about your customers,

946
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:35,890
it's also one thing you have to be worried
about is the over investment, right?

947
00:55:35,891 --> 00:55:39,460
So if you're overinvesting in
customers that really aren't worth it,

948
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:43,120
that's something that will happen to you
regardless of the size of your company.

949
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:46,300
The other thing that we work really
hard at in the book, in fact,

950
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:48,670
we've structured the book in
such a way that we're talking,

951
00:55:48,671 --> 00:55:53,080
we're trying to train your eye to look
at acquisition, retention, development,

952
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,420
and then understand time.

953
00:55:55,870 --> 00:55:59,680
There's a time component to that where
you are in the maturity of your company,

954
00:55:59,681 --> 00:56:03,070
whether you're large or small,
and how that changes your tactics.

955
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:05,770
We're talking about being nimble,
about experimenting.

956
00:56:05,771 --> 00:56:09,940
Like I said before about testing your
hypotheses. And these are principles,

957
00:56:09,941 --> 00:56:14,140
especially in the, you know, the era of
data that we're in that are applicable,

958
00:56:14,141 --> 00:56:15,250
whether you're large or small.

959
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:17,020
And let me just to add to that,

960
00:56:17,021 --> 00:56:21,100
cause in an era where we're every day
we're talking about the retail apocalypse

961
00:56:21,101 --> 00:56:24,510
and all this kind of thing, I'm actually
very about it and I think that the,

962
00:56:24,511 --> 00:56:26,890
the future rises from the small companies,

963
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:29,830
those digitally native
directly consumer companies,

964
00:56:29,831 --> 00:56:33,400
many of which are right
around here. Um, there,

965
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:36,730
I don't want to say that there had
kind of textbook customers centricity

966
00:56:36,731 --> 00:56:40,060
examples, but there are a heck of a
lot better than their older, bigger,

967
00:56:40,061 --> 00:56:44,260
slower brethren. And so, so
again, implicitly or explicitly,

968
00:56:44,261 --> 00:56:46,120
they're starting to embrace
a lot of these ideas.

969
00:56:46,330 --> 00:56:47,620
They're starting to tag and track.

970
00:56:47,621 --> 00:56:51,490
Customers calculate COVs a lot earlier
than traditional companies would.

971
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:55,030
And what's happening is those big old
companies are starting to take them a lot

972
00:56:55,031 --> 00:56:58,510
more seriously instead of dismissing
them as a passing fad or just a little

973
00:56:58,511 --> 00:57:01,690
teeny tiny niche. They're saying we can
learn a lot from them. You know what,

974
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:05,920
let's hire some of them to start running
our marketing or our whole company.

975
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:10,300
So I think a lot of these ideas are
kind of working their way up and it's

976
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:14,440
sometimes it's the little
companies leading the way. Renee.

977
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:18,400
Hi, thank you guys both for um, for today.

978
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:23,820
Kind of related to that last point,
is there a certain threshold now,

979
00:57:23,821 --> 00:57:28,090
so much size of company but maybe
thresh hold up data right that you need.

980
00:57:28,091 --> 00:57:33,010
So for instance, do you need five,
5,000 customers or 5 million?

981
00:57:33,370 --> 00:57:34,510
Do you need two years,

982
00:57:34,511 --> 00:57:38,380
three years or five years of transaction
data to actually make that model work?

983
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:41,620
Like what's the thresholds?
Because that will definitely tell us.

984
00:57:41,621 --> 00:57:43,660
He may be a small company
growing very rapidly,

985
00:57:43,661 --> 00:57:47,230
but then you hit a certain threshold
of customers but you don't have enough

986
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:50,910
years or enough data to actually make
the model work. Any thoughts like that?

987
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:51,790
Absolutely.

988
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:55,480
And know I sort of almost implicitly
answered the question when I was talking

989
00:57:55,481 --> 00:57:58,360
about the kinds of companies that we
work with on customer base corporate

990
00:57:58,361 --> 00:58:00,610
valuation.
I said late stage VC's,

991
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:04,390
we can't really do it at the early stages
for exactly the reasons you pointed

992
00:58:04,391 --> 00:58:08,800
out that you don't have enough customers
to really see or or estimate that full

993
00:58:08,801 --> 00:58:12,790
CLV distribution and in terms of the kind
of length of the runway that you need.

994
00:58:12,791 --> 00:58:16,540
It's kind of interesting that I
don't need a long runway of date.

995
00:58:16,541 --> 00:58:17,680
I need enough customers,

996
00:58:17,681 --> 00:58:20,680
but I don't need a long amount of time
in order to estimate these models.

997
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:24,910
But I still don't really trust them
until I have about two or three years.

998
00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:29,110
And why is that? Because one of the
issues that we haven't spoken about,

999
00:58:29,111 --> 00:58:30,850
but it would make a big
deal about it in the book,

1000
00:58:30,851 --> 00:58:34,180
and I can't say enough about it in
practice or cohorts of customers,

1001
00:58:34,330 --> 00:58:38,410
we always run these models for a given
group of customers generally who we

1002
00:58:38,411 --> 00:58:39,730
acquired at the same time.

1003
00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:44,290
And the issue is that the cohorts are
not all created equal and that as we go

1004
00:58:44,291 --> 00:58:44,800
over times,

1005
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:48,040
we get that first cohort of customers
required soon after we were founded.

1006
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:50,470
They tend to be much better customers.

1007
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:53,410
And so we don't want to just kind
of calculate CLV is on them and say,

1008
00:58:53,411 --> 00:58:56,830
where are an amazing company? Hey,
let's raise some more capital. Um,

1009
00:58:56,860 --> 00:59:01,860
so we need enough time to see a bunch of
the different cohorts we have to play,

1010
00:59:02,291 --> 00:59:03,940
connect the dots across them.

1011
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:07,570
You've got to watch them
start to stabilize a little
bit so we can anticipate

1012
00:59:07,571 --> 00:59:10,210
what the subsequent in
the kind of steady state,

1013
00:59:10,211 --> 00:59:12,370
mature cohorts are going to look like.
So yes,

1014
00:59:12,371 --> 00:59:14,710
we do need enough customers
to see the heterogeneity.

1015
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:19,150
We do need enough of a runway to see the
cross colar dynamics and obviously we

1016
00:59:19,151 --> 00:59:20,620
do need enough,
you know,

1017
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:23,810
cleanliness of data to trust
those results in the first place.

1018
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,690
Sometimes these models that I endorse,

1019
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:30,770
sometimes they're too good that they'll
work really well even when you kind of

1020
00:59:30,771 --> 00:59:34,700
put in crappy data and it gives you this
false sense of security about it. So,

1021
00:59:34,701 --> 00:59:38,990
so all the issues you raised are right
on the money. And with that in mind,

1022
00:59:38,991 --> 00:59:43,070
I recognize that most companies aren't
born to do customer centricity right out

1023
00:59:43,071 --> 00:59:46,010
of the gate. We're going to be
born around a particular product.

1024
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:50,600
We just want them to look ahead and
start doing all that tagging and tracking

1025
00:59:50,601 --> 00:59:54,020
costs. Two, three years later. Maybe
it's time to do that, pivot towards it,

1026
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:58,410
but it's going to take some time.
Great. Thank you. Hey, I don't know,

1027
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,650
we don't want to hold people hostage here.

1028
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:05,120
See if there's time for any
other pressing issues. If not,

1029
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:07,790
you got our contact info over here.
Uh,

1030
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:12,390
and we are absolutely delighted to
keep the conversation going. As I,

1031
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:13,460
as I said before,

1032
01:00:13,550 --> 01:00:16,610
this really is the first time
that we've presented this content.

1033
01:00:16,690 --> 01:00:18,260
A book's only been out for a few weeks,

1034
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:21,910
so we're very much open all your
questions, but, but feedback, uh,

1035
01:00:21,911 --> 01:00:26,450
and just kinda tell us how we can spread
the gospel of customer centricity and

1036
01:00:26,451 --> 01:00:29,720
how we can help you do it more
effectively as well. So with that,

1037
01:00:29,721 --> 01:00:32,840
I want to thank Neil and the rest of
the team over here for giving us this

1038
01:00:32,841 --> 01:00:37,520
opportunity and for all of you for
taking the time and best wishes on your

1039
01:00:37,521 --> 01:00:38,600
customers and your journey.
