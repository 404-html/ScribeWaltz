1
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:10,010
Good afternoon. Well, I am
so delighted to be here.

2
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:13,460
Google is really one of my favorite
places to work and to talk.

3
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,970
So when I want to talk about today is
I want to talk about what I call the

4
00:00:16,971 --> 00:00:19,490
contribution gap and our personal brands.

5
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:24,730
So a few years ago I had a six month
period and in that six month period I left

6
00:00:26,811 --> 00:00:29,930
a long marriage after a couple
of decades and got a divorce.

7
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,470
My step all within six months,
my stepfather dropped dead.

8
00:00:33,471 --> 00:00:36,980
My stepfather died of a lung disease.
My father dropped dead after,

9
00:00:36,981 --> 00:00:37,970
after a heart attack,

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
two weeks later I moved from California
to New York and then back to California

11
00:00:43,281 --> 00:00:46,580
again.
And as one of my friends said,

12
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:50,000
you know how there's those scales of
things you're not supposed to do because

13
00:00:50,001 --> 00:00:53,630
they can kill you. There's things
like move or a death in the family.

14
00:00:53,631 --> 00:00:56,000
They increase your rate of death. She
said, you're not supposed to do even one,

15
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,230
one of them, let alone all six of
them in a short period of time.

16
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:05,060
And so it really made me stop and I had
to stop and I had to step back and I had

17
00:01:05,061 --> 00:01:08,210
to take a look at what did I want
the next period of my life to be,

18
00:01:08,211 --> 00:01:11,210
what really was my contribution
in the next period of my life?

19
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,600
And so I went on this long year long
research project about what is really at

20
00:01:16,761 --> 00:01:18,140
the heart of our contribution,

21
00:01:18,141 --> 00:01:20,270
what is really at the heart
of our personal brands.

22
00:01:20,271 --> 00:01:23,450
And what I want to share with you
today is what I found out in that year.

23
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,440
Because what I found out in that year
really changed my own personal brand.

24
00:01:27,441 --> 00:01:30,080
It changed how I think about things.
It changed how I work.

25
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:35,270
It changed how I work with clients. And
I found that in that research that I did,

26
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,170
there's a lot we can learn about our
brands and our contribution that isn't

27
00:01:39,171 --> 00:01:40,940
always the way that we talk about them.

28
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,490
And I'm so that's what I want
to talk about with you today.

29
00:01:43,491 --> 00:01:46,580
I want to share what I learned
in that research with you today.

30
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,340
The first thing I want to ask you to do,
I know everyone sat down,

31
00:01:49,341 --> 00:01:52,910
but the first thing I'd love
to ask everybody to do is
just to stand up for one

32
00:01:52,911 --> 00:01:55,610
minute and I just sat down,

33
00:01:55,611 --> 00:01:59,420
but stand up for one minute and what I'd
like you to do is say hello to one or

34
00:01:59,421 --> 00:02:02,540
two people around you only.
Here's the catch. Say Hello.

35
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:06,410
Like you're really looking for someone
a lot more important to say hello to.

36
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,140
All right, so if everybody
would just do that for a minute,

37
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,190
go ahead and say hello.

38
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:15,980
All right.

39
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:20,780
Now would you please say hello to
somebody next to you or around you,

40
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:21,980
but say hello.

41
00:02:21,981 --> 00:02:25,940
Like they're your long lost friend and
you're thrilled to have found them again.

42
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:35,680
All right, stop. Very good.
Thank you. And have a seat.

43
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:40,990
So you know how in that first one
it was a little bit like miss. So,

44
00:02:40,991 --> 00:02:45,340
so in the second one, the the volume,
I saw many more hugs in the second one,

45
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,320
right?
And the volume goes up.

46
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,880
I think when we have a really strong
idea of our personal brand and we have a

47
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:53,770
really strong idea of what we contribute,

48
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,320
it's much easier to
connect with other people.

49
00:02:56,321 --> 00:03:01,060
It's almost like we walk into the room
with that because sense of connection is

50
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:04,720
much more palatable and it isn't
that it's bad. The first experience,

51
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:09,310
it's just a little sort of empty. And
what I call that as the contribution gap,

52
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,530
when we're really clear about our brand,

53
00:03:11,531 --> 00:03:14,530
when we're really clear about our
contribution than what we have,

54
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:17,680
is this a way to instantly
almost connect with other people?

55
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,920
Whether these are people at a conference,
whether there are people we work with,

56
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:22,930
whether they're people
in a social situation,

57
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:27,490
it gives us that sense of what our
contribution is. We walk in with that.

58
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,760
And so what I studied in that year that
I had was what the contribution gap was

59
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:37,420
in my own life and what the contribution
contribution gap was in other people's

60
00:03:37,421 --> 00:03:38,254
lives.

61
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,240
And one of the things I found in my
research is one of the things that gets in

62
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:47,320
the way of our brands being the
strongest and our contribution making our

63
00:03:47,321 --> 00:03:50,350
greatest contribution is what
I call the myth of roles.

64
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:54,880
And this is all the I am's in our
life. I am a mother, I am a wife,

65
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:58,620
I am a software engineer,
I am a dancer, right?

66
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:03,370
I am a cat lover, I am a dog lover.
I'm a fan of game of Thrones.

67
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,920
Whatever your I am's are,
whatever your roles are.

68
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:10,180
And so I discovered that these roles
really are one of the things that get in

69
00:04:10,181 --> 00:04:13,870
the way of our contribution.
And for some of you,

70
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:16,540
like what are some of the roles that
you have? You can just shout it out.

71
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,310
Some of the roles that you have, personal
or professional daughter. Exactly.

72
00:04:21,311 --> 00:04:25,120
What else? Husband. Yes. What else?

73
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,330
Roommate. Exactly. Googler.
Yes. Very important role.

74
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,060
But what's the problem with all roles?

75
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:39,040
Eventually what happens to all roles?
Eventually they end,

76
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:42,370
right? They, by their nature,
all roles eventually end.

77
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,900
And so if we think our contribution or
the heart of our contribution is about

78
00:04:46,901 --> 00:04:50,800
our roles, then what happens is when
they end, we find ourselves going, well,

79
00:04:50,801 --> 00:04:53,320
who am I?
What is it that I have to contribute?

80
00:04:53,321 --> 00:04:57,340
That's a lot of what happened when my
father died and I stopped being someone's

81
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,560
my father's daughter.
It was still my mother's daughter.

82
00:04:59,561 --> 00:05:03,130
But when I stopped being
my father's daughter when I
got a divorce and I was now

83
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:05,050
not someone's wife,
and you know,

84
00:05:05,051 --> 00:05:07,620
all of these roles and I wasn't
to California in anymore.

85
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,450
And so all these roles started to
change and I started to say, well,

86
00:05:10,451 --> 00:05:12,100
if I'm not all of that, who I am, I,

87
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:15,010
so one of the things that gets in the
way of our personal brands and our

88
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:18,640
contributions is this myth of
the roles who we think we are.

89
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,850
The other thing I discovered in
my research in a, by the way I,

90
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,380
I interviewed several thousand people
all over the world in different companies

91
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:31,030
and male, female does,
despite age, race, gender,

92
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:33,850
it didn't matter. What I found was
there was a lot of commonalities.

93
00:05:33,851 --> 00:05:37,000
And the other commonality was this
myth of knowledge and results.

94
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:42,030
A lot of us define our brands and our
contribution by the results we produce or

95
00:05:42,581 --> 00:05:47,080
what we know. The writer Gretchen cryer
calls that the, I know the world's up.

96
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,910
So what are the worlds that we know,
right?

97
00:05:48,911 --> 00:05:52,420
Like you might know the worlds of
volleyball or the world of travel,

98
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:56,470
or the world of Google or the world of
speaking French or the world of dogs.

99
00:05:56,471 --> 00:06:00,650
There's million that you can know
and all that is part of our brand.

100
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:04,160
But that's not the heart of our
contribution or the heart of our brand.

101
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,000
And so the other thing I've found in my
research is that people often get very

102
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:12,230
stifled because they think that
their brand or they think that their,

103
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:15,470
their contribution are
these worlds that they know.

104
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,280
So if it's not those two
things, what is it? Well,

105
00:06:19,281 --> 00:06:20,750
here's what I found in my research.

106
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:25,810
I found that our brands
and our contribution at the
heart of them is what I call

107
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:31,070
the, whether you bring with you, it's
the thing when you walk into the room,

108
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:35,600
it just comes with you.
It's the thing that people feel from us.

109
00:06:35,601 --> 00:06:39,710
It's the thing that people can sense
about us and feel from us the moment they

110
00:06:39,711 --> 00:06:42,170
walk into a room without
knowing anything about us.

111
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,490
So I'll give you an example of this.

112
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:48,410
I was walking in the lower east side of
Manhattan about a year ago with a friend

113
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,760
and we see this woman,

114
00:06:49,761 --> 00:06:54,761
a traffic cop and she's directing traffic
and she hasn't just directing traffic.

115
00:06:55,011 --> 00:06:57,410
She's doing it like it's ballet.

116
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,940
Now I have the greatest respect
for New York city traffic cops.

117
00:07:00,941 --> 00:07:04,220
That is a hard job.
But a lot of them often look,

118
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:08,900
have the look on their face like this
would be a great job if it wasn't for all

119
00:07:08,901 --> 00:07:13,901
those people driving cars and this woman
is leaping and she's jumping and she's

120
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:18,830
going, come on sir, go this
way ladies cross the street.

121
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:23,540
She is so alive and so
enthusiastic and we're all just,

122
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:27,710
all the pedestrians are standing
there like this. Wow. Like,

123
00:07:27,711 --> 00:07:32,420
we're just watching this and the cars
are honking at her and waving and she is

124
00:07:32,421 --> 00:07:34,970
this great example of bringing the,
whether you bring with you,

125
00:07:34,971 --> 00:07:39,260
she has just got this a lightness in
this joy and she's making this amazing

126
00:07:39,261 --> 00:07:39,921
contribution.

127
00:07:39,921 --> 00:07:43,910
And of course she's completely
establishing her brand by
what she's doing right.

128
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,190
But she's doing it in this
really enthusiastic, excited
way and cars are honking.

129
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:53,270
And the thing that was amazing about this
woman was did she know she had a solid

130
00:07:53,271 --> 00:07:57,260
role as like a traffic cop? Yes. I'm sure
she did. What she knowledgeable, yes.

131
00:07:57,261 --> 00:07:59,540
I'm sure she was knowledgeable
in all thing traffic laws,

132
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,930
but it wasn't her role or her
knowledge that was making a difference.

133
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,880
It was the way she was doing it.

134
00:08:04,881 --> 00:08:08,660
It was the weather that she was bringing
with her that was making a difference.

135
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,340
And in the work that I did,
and in the research that I did,

136
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:18,370
I actually found that there's
some archetypes or there
are some ways that people

137
00:08:19,401 --> 00:08:23,630
typically contribute and I call these
brand energies or brand archetypes.

138
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,460
These are,
and there were 12 of them.

139
00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:30,461
I actually could identify and find 12
core brand archetypes of how we approach

140
00:08:30,861 --> 00:08:33,710
our personal brands and how we contribute.

141
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:38,450
And the interesting thing about these
brand energies is all of us have access to

142
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:42,890
all these energies, right? Any of us
can step into any of these at any time.

143
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:47,630
But usually there's one or two that
when we look back to being kids,

144
00:08:47,631 --> 00:08:51,770
we can see that way, way,
way back, we had this,

145
00:08:51,771 --> 00:08:54,620
this is something that we,
we had even as kids,

146
00:08:54,621 --> 00:08:58,410
this is always in a way Brent
been what we bring to the party.

147
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,480
It's been the weather
that we bring with us.

148
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,940
And so I want you to go through
these 12 archetypes with you.

149
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,660
Cause I want you to think about as I go
through them, where do you see yourself?

150
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,970
But where do you see the
people that you work with?

151
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:12,810
Because one of the other things I found
in a row in the research was that the

152
00:09:12,811 --> 00:09:16,260
best marriages, the best
teams, the best departments,

153
00:09:16,261 --> 00:09:17,970
the best problem solving groups,

154
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,770
all of those people had people
with different contribution styles,

155
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:26,940
with different brand energies that it
wasn't just one that when you had people

156
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:31,440
with a mix, when you had more of
a diversity of contribution style,

157
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,520
things went a lot better because people
brought different things to the party.

158
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:38,730
So I'm going to go through the 12
that I discovered with you now for the

159
00:09:38,731 --> 00:09:43,260
overachievers in here who were like, no,
I'm not just one or two, I'm all 12 fine,

160
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:47,850
you can be all 12 but generally you'll
notice as I go through that you usually

161
00:09:47,851 --> 00:09:51,510
tend to be leaning more in the
direction of one or the other.

162
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,470
And that's important.

163
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,790
It's important to know which ones you
are because then you can invite other

164
00:09:56,791 --> 00:10:00,720
people to the party and to be on teams
with you and to work with you who are

165
00:10:00,721 --> 00:10:04,500
different, who actually bring a different
kind of energy and contribution.

166
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,020
And when you're putting teams together,

167
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:10,980
you can consciously think about how am
I going to have this team reflect all of

168
00:10:10,981 --> 00:10:15,210
those different kinds of energies or at
least a mix. So it's not just one type.

169
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:18,840
So here was one of them. These are people
whose, whether they bring with them,

170
00:10:18,841 --> 00:10:23,250
their contribution is the fixer and the
fixer is the person that's the healer

171
00:10:23,251 --> 00:10:24,990
there restore their,
the mender.

172
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:29,010
These are the people that you give when
a problem needs to be solved because you

173
00:10:29,011 --> 00:10:30,900
know that that's the thing that they love.

174
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,890
My friend Joanna used to talk about her
dad who was in real estate and she'd say

175
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,510
her father would come into work every
morning. He'd sit down as a desk,

176
00:10:39,511 --> 00:10:43,830
he'd roll up his sleeves, he get his cup
of coffee out, and he literally say, okay,

177
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:47,040
what problems do we have today?
And he was excited.

178
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:51,150
He was excited to see what problems,
uh, showed up. Not to know about you,

179
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,460
but I do not go into my office
every morning and go, wow,

180
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:58,350
what problems do we have today at tends
not to be my relationship with problems.

181
00:10:58,351 --> 00:11:02,790
I have other things I do, but not
that. So fixers love problems.

182
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:05,560
That's one of the things
that's in that archetype there.

183
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,490
Really those kinds of people,
useful people to have on a team,

184
00:11:08,491 --> 00:11:12,900
useful energy to have because those
people are able to literally take that

185
00:11:12,901 --> 00:11:15,690
attitude towards making
something better and solve it.

186
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,620
Then you have people that are facilitators
and this archetype is people that are

187
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,740
mediators and moderators and go between.
So you know,

188
00:11:22,741 --> 00:11:26,910
these are the people that are able to
take all these different groups and

189
00:11:26,911 --> 00:11:29,970
different people and get them aligned
and going in the same direction.

190
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,150
Amazing skill to have, right?
Amazing contribution to make.

191
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,690
Then you have people that
are storytellers, right?

192
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,370
And storytellers are these
narrators and orders and minstrels.

193
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,271
These are the people,

194
00:11:42,271 --> 00:11:46,080
whether it's through writing or whether
it's through painting or whether it's

195
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:49,590
through video or whether it's through
dance or whether it's through theater.

196
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:54,860
These are the people that are able to
convey this emotion and this feeling

197
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:59,320
through story and those are incredibly
important people to have in our world and

198
00:11:59,321 --> 00:12:00,850
in our life and our teams.

199
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,940
Because when you have that brand of
being a storyteller, when that's the,

200
00:12:03,941 --> 00:12:05,260
whether you bring with you,

201
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:09,160
you're able to translate all of these
things in a way that's very powerful.

202
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:09,701
You know,

203
00:12:09,701 --> 00:12:13,600
one of the things that I learned in my
research was that metaphor and stories

204
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,170
was one of the best way to get your point
across to somebody that when you could

205
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:18,850
speak in metaphors and stories,

206
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:23,170
people were able to hear it in a much
different way than when it was just pure

207
00:12:23,171 --> 00:12:24,730
straight facts and figures.

208
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,480
Then you have people that are
synthesizers and people who the,

209
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:31,600
whether they bring with
them as synthesizers and the
energy that they bring with

210
00:12:31,601 --> 00:12:36,040
them. These are the integrators and the
blenders and the producers. You know,

211
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:40,030
these are the people that are able
to take all these disparate things,

212
00:12:40,031 --> 00:12:42,160
put them together and
create something new.

213
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:46,720
And those synthesizers are people that
we rely on because they're able to see

214
00:12:46,721 --> 00:12:49,060
something new in all of
the different elements.

215
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:54,270
And there it's a really wonderful rich
archetype and a really wonderful enrich

216
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,330
brand energy because bringing all those
things together is often the thing that

217
00:12:58,331 --> 00:13:00,100
transforms it.
You know,

218
00:13:00,101 --> 00:13:04,210
from a caterpillar to a butterfly
transforms it into something brand new and

219
00:13:04,211 --> 00:13:05,044
beautiful.

220
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,470
Then you have people that are mentors
and the mentors are interesting because

221
00:13:08,471 --> 00:13:10,880
these are the people
whose contribution there.

222
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:15,820
They're real essence of their brand is
being advisors and teachers and guides.

223
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,020
And I love this picture.

224
00:13:17,021 --> 00:13:21,220
This is actually a photo that I took at
the think it's the wizarding world of

225
00:13:21,221 --> 00:13:21,761
Harry Potter.

226
00:13:21,761 --> 00:13:25,900
I was visiting with some friends in
their kids and this little kid saw one of

227
00:13:25,901 --> 00:13:30,430
these minions and the look on
this child's face was like,

228
00:13:30,431 --> 00:13:34,300
he had just seen God, ah, and he
wandered the parents there. You know,

229
00:13:34,301 --> 00:13:37,870
when the kid wanders up to the minion
and you can see the way he's just kissing

230
00:13:37,871 --> 00:13:39,190
the minion and looking at them.

231
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,810
But often our relationship with mentors
is we look up to them and we admire them

232
00:13:43,811 --> 00:13:46,570
so much because it's the
people with this energy.

233
00:13:46,571 --> 00:13:50,470
They're the people that are
really shepherding us along
and helping us make our

234
00:13:50,471 --> 00:13:54,190
goals and helping us be the
best people that we can be.

235
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:58,900
And so this mentor energy is incredibly
important and valuable as a contribution.

236
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,070
That's the thing about all
these archetypes. One isn't
better than the other.

237
00:14:03,071 --> 00:14:07,180
One is not more useful than the other
one isn't more desirable than the other.

238
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:12,310
They're all useful and that's why when
you have teams or groups or people that

239
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:14,380
have a mix of them together,

240
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:18,040
you get tend to get a better result
because you're getting all of these

241
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:21,250
different energies together. You're
getting all of these different archetypes,

242
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:25,330
which you can see you really
need to produce the best outcome.

243
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:30,331
And really owning the archetype that we
are really owning what our contribution

244
00:14:30,881 --> 00:14:35,680
is and being certain about
our contribution and really
making it is a big part

245
00:14:35,681 --> 00:14:37,570
of people who have strong personal brands.

246
00:14:37,571 --> 00:14:42,571
They know to the depth of their being
what that contribution is and they trust

247
00:14:42,671 --> 00:14:45,130
it.
They trust their own contribution.

248
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,540
That is what I found in my research was
these people were very solid in what

249
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:54,110
their contribution was. It doesn't mean
they couldn't step into other energies,

250
00:14:54,111 --> 00:14:57,170
but they really saw the
depth of that contribution.

251
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,390
Then you have people that are connectors.

252
00:14:59,391 --> 00:15:01,550
These are some of my
favorite kinds of energies.

253
00:15:01,551 --> 00:15:04,310
There's people that are connectors and
these are the networkers in the arrangers

254
00:15:04,311 --> 00:15:05,270
and the coordinators.

255
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:08,210
These are the people that you'll
go to a party and they'll go, hey,

256
00:15:08,211 --> 00:15:11,390
you should know such and such and I'm
going to do an email and introduce you to

257
00:15:11,391 --> 00:15:14,570
this person because you two should
talk to each other about this,

258
00:15:14,571 --> 00:15:17,300
that and the other thing. They're
always putting people together, right?

259
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,660
And the people they put together magically
seem to be perfect for each other in

260
00:15:20,661 --> 00:15:23,420
terms of the contribution
they can make to each other.

261
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:27,140
Then you have people that are
visionaries and the visionaries are the

262
00:15:27,141 --> 00:15:30,860
conceptualizers and the
idealist and the dreamers,

263
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:33,740
and these are the people that
are able to see something.

264
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:37,940
And actually come up with the
concept of what it should be, right?

265
00:15:37,941 --> 00:15:40,580
These are the people that are
actually able to stop and go,

266
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:43,820
foom we're doing it this way, but maybe
we could do it that way. You know,

267
00:15:43,821 --> 00:15:45,860
this is sort of this ideal that I have.

268
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:50,720
Then we have people that are motivators
and motivators are a little bit

269
00:15:50,721 --> 00:15:53,300
different than mentors.
They might mentor,

270
00:15:53,301 --> 00:15:56,300
but motivators of those people that
can light a fire under us right there.

271
00:15:56,301 --> 00:15:59,300
The cheerleaders and the
influencers and the persuaders,

272
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,770
these are the people that really can get
a group of people going on a team and a

273
00:16:03,771 --> 00:16:05,660
group individually with friends.

274
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,780
These are the people that they just walk
in the door and what they bring with

275
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:13,760
them is this instant sort of cheeriness
and influence and ability to persuade.

276
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:18,170
Then you have the people that are the
makers and these are the artisans and the

277
00:16:18,171 --> 00:16:22,790
creators and the inventors
and these people could be
creating code or they could

278
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:26,780
be creating paintings. I have this thing
I talk about is the everyday artist.

279
00:16:26,781 --> 00:16:31,070
One of the things I discovered in my
research was everyone is what I call an

280
00:16:31,071 --> 00:16:35,930
everyday artist. Every single person
has something about what they do.

281
00:16:35,931 --> 00:16:39,110
That's art.
Doesn't matter if their computer coding.

282
00:16:39,111 --> 00:16:41,510
It doesn't matter if they're a doctor,
it doesn't matter if they're a painter.

283
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:45,290
Everyone has something that they
do that a part of it is their art.

284
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,690
It's the way they do it,
where they're creating,

285
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:52,930
and these people literally are driven
by inventing and creating an art.

286
00:16:53,781 --> 00:16:58,700
That's their whole world. It's not just
painting. It's not just being on stage.

287
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:02,690
It could be, I've known people that
are artisans that that's their makers,

288
00:17:02,691 --> 00:17:05,480
that's their essential self.

289
00:17:05,481 --> 00:17:09,050
They're essential contribution and what
they're making is code or what they're

290
00:17:09,051 --> 00:17:12,560
making our products, but it's that,
that feeling of that they're creating.

291
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,160
Then you have people that are advocates
and these are the people that are the

292
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:19,010
activists and the champions
and the campaigners.

293
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,770
These are the people that you invite
to a dinner party and they can't help,

294
00:17:21,771 --> 00:17:23,930
but they're going to talk about what
they're passionate about and what they're

295
00:17:23,931 --> 00:17:26,660
advocating for no matter what.
Even at a dinner party.

296
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:28,670
That's their energy that
they bring with them.

297
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:32,510
Then you have people that are
implementers and these are achievers and

298
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:34,190
administrators and executors.

299
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,610
These people are awesome because
it's one thing to have ideas.

300
00:17:37,611 --> 00:17:39,140
It's another thing,
right?

301
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,880
To have those ideas actually get
implemented and so these people are really

302
00:17:43,881 --> 00:17:47,780
amazing at taking something from a
concept and an idea and making it happen.

303
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,690
Then you have people that are interpreters
and these are the people that are

304
00:17:51,691 --> 00:17:56,691
able to translate and change and
transform an idea or a group of ideas and

305
00:17:57,091 --> 00:18:01,100
interpreted in a way that's something
completely new happens that comes in

306
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,190
completely new occurs because they're
able to take all those different parts and

307
00:18:05,191 --> 00:18:09,720
not only synthesize them but interpret
them in a totally new and different way.

308
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,630
So what gets in the way of those things,
right? Those are, those are some of our,

309
00:18:15,631 --> 00:18:18,870
our contributions and archetypes.
What gets in the way of them? Well,

310
00:18:18,871 --> 00:18:21,840
the first thing is is do
you know what yours is?

311
00:18:21,841 --> 00:18:23,790
Can you have a sense of
what your archetype is?

312
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:27,060
Actually what I'd love everybody to do
is just kind of quickly pair up with

313
00:18:27,061 --> 00:18:30,300
someone next to you and have those
ones that I just ran through.

314
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,850
Which one do you,
which one or two do you think you are?

315
00:18:32,851 --> 00:18:34,860
Which one resonates
most strongly with you?

316
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,530
And then which one or two
reminded you of someone you know,

317
00:18:37,531 --> 00:18:40,740
so everybody just get a partner and
really quickly just sort of with your

318
00:18:40,741 --> 00:18:45,570
partner share with that is
great.

319
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,180
So let me just hear some
examples of what you,

320
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,340
which one resonated with you personally?

321
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,180
Which ones resonated with you personally?
Let me just hear some examples.

322
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:57,630
Visionary.

323
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,700
Visionary. Okay, great. Who else?

324
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,480
That's an implementer

325
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,100
and implementer.
Okay.

326
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,290
So you know what's interesting
is if we put these two together,

327
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:07,550
there are a perfect pair,
right?

328
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,920
Cause we have the vision and
then we have implementation.

329
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:14,810
What happens when you have a team? Just
evolve. Visionaries, they're happy,

330
00:19:14,811 --> 00:19:18,680
they're excited, but nothing gets
done because they're not implementers.

331
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:21,350
What happens when you have
a team of all implementers?

332
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,633
Okay.

333
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:25,880
They can, yeah, they're
awesome at getting it done,

334
00:19:25,881 --> 00:19:28,480
but they could be going in the wrong
direction or they could be going into

335
00:19:28,481 --> 00:19:33,160
limited direction, which is why we need
everyone's contribution. Whites is widest.

336
00:19:33,161 --> 00:19:36,760
Diversity of contribution is
really, really important. Why?

337
00:19:36,761 --> 00:19:40,780
It's important to have this inclusion
of different people who have different

338
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,990
contributions to bring in teams
and groups, et Cetera. Who else?

339
00:19:43,991 --> 00:19:45,850
Did we just hear a few
other examples over here?

340
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,713
Yeah,

341
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:53,070
there's connectors. Yes.
You're all like together.

342
00:19:53,071 --> 00:19:57,630
The connectors are all connected. Okay,
perfect. You manage to find each other.

343
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:01,770
Great. So how many of you could see your
coworkers in this? Just raise your hands.

344
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,240
Yep.
Your bosses,

345
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:08,280
your wives maybe see their animals ruins.
While people say to me,

346
00:20:08,281 --> 00:20:10,320
I think my dogs that connect or I'm like,
okay,

347
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,310
so what gets in the way of this?
Well,

348
00:20:14,311 --> 00:20:17,490
one of the things I found in the research
was that one of the big things that

349
00:20:17,491 --> 00:20:21,870
gets in the way that creates
a contribution gap is
our fear of missing out.

350
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:22,471
You know?

351
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:26,850
And we live in a world where it's easier
than ever to have this fear of missing

352
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:29,950
out, isn't it? Because every
time we turn on, you know,

353
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:32,670
the iPhone or the thing or the
Google, whatever, we're using,

354
00:20:32,671 --> 00:20:35,100
whatever PDA we're using, the
Google, the iPhone, whatever.

355
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:39,720
Every time we turn it on, what happens?
We look at Facebook and we see,

356
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:42,810
oh, that person's living so
much of a better life than I am.

357
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,600
They're having so much more fun than I am.
It doesn't.

358
00:20:45,601 --> 00:20:49,210
Everyone's life looks so much better
than ours. Come on, tell the truth.

359
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,490
Do you know? It's like I'm always
looking and going, well, wow,

360
00:20:51,491 --> 00:20:55,480
Kim Carr Dashi and didn't retweet my
picture of my macaroni and cheese.

361
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,750
How come I want to be the
mother of dragons? You know?

362
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,850
So what happens is we have this fear
of missing out that happens in part,

363
00:21:03,851 --> 00:21:07,750
we have, social media has been wonderful
for a lot of things and I love it,

364
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:10,420
but it's also contributed
to this fear of missing out.

365
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:15,450
It's contributed to this idea that somehow
everybody's living this better life

366
00:21:15,821 --> 00:21:16,630
than we are.

367
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:20,230
And the fear of missing out was one of
the things that my research showed really

368
00:21:20,231 --> 00:21:22,330
got in the way of people's contribution.

369
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:27,370
And it also created a sense of isolation.
It created a sense of,

370
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:29,980
I'm sort of here in my
world doing my thing,

371
00:21:29,981 --> 00:21:34,480
and other people are in their world
doing their thing and we're not really

372
00:21:34,481 --> 00:21:37,000
always connected. Even though
we might be connected on social,

373
00:21:37,001 --> 00:21:38,440
we're not always connecting.

374
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:42,610
So what I found in the research was that
this fear of missing out led to a sense

375
00:21:42,611 --> 00:21:47,611
of emptiness that had people not
really believe or have faith in their

376
00:21:48,101 --> 00:21:51,070
contribution,
like their contribution wasn't enough,

377
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:55,630
their contribution was
somehow insufficient or not
enough to bring to the party.

378
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,130
That's one of the things that gets in
the way. So how do you bridge that gap?

379
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,560
Well, I think you bridge that
gap a couple of the ways.

380
00:22:02,561 --> 00:22:06,970
And one of the ways you bridge it is by
practicing what my friend Lynette calls

381
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:10,270
the joy of missing out.
So instead of the fear of missing out,

382
00:22:10,271 --> 00:22:14,080
you practice the joy of missing out.
I love Lynette because I will say to her,

383
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,170
Lynette, do you want to go to the
movie? And she'll go, yeah, no,

384
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:20,020
I don't really feel like doing that.
And I'll go, okay, well Lynette,

385
00:22:20,021 --> 00:22:22,180
do you want to do this? No,
I don't think so. Does that.

386
00:22:22,181 --> 00:22:23,560
Then Lynnette doesn't participate.

387
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:26,470
She just isn't afraid of
missing out on things.

388
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:29,530
So she really has that
joy of not doing things.

389
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:35,280
And how many times do we do something
because we have a fear of missing out on

390
00:22:35,441 --> 00:22:38,860
it. We're just afraid to say no cause we
might miss this opportunity or we might

391
00:22:38,861 --> 00:22:42,610
miss this person or something might
happen. You know, a few years ago,

392
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,630
I love to travel. Travel is one of my
most favorite things in the world to do.

393
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,990
And a few years ago I got
invited to go with a girlfriend.

394
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:53,650
A friend of mine was going
to go to Iceland and she
had a small group of people

395
00:22:53,651 --> 00:22:56,290
put together some friends.
So I decided to go to Iceland.

396
00:22:56,291 --> 00:23:00,970
I'd never been there to see the northern
lights. Now, I know that Iceland is cold,

397
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:05,110
but I thought Iceland was
cold the Way New York is cold.

398
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:09,310
And what I found out is no, Iceland
is not cold the Way New York is cold,

399
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,590
it's much,
much colder.

400
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:16,810
So I as a result was not properly
dressed in Iceland and it was,

401
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,280
I think it was in the winter of two.

402
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:21,940
So I was not properly dressed
in Iceland and I looked good,

403
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:27,090
but I was really cold and I was so cold
that I actually got violently sick,

404
00:23:27,191 --> 00:23:28,870
like seriously sick and Iceland.

405
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:32,020
And so I spent most of my time
in bed with a cold recovering.

406
00:23:32,021 --> 00:23:35,380
It was just one of those trips that
didn't, nothing turned out right.

407
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,900
Rarely happens what I traveled,
but nothing turned out.

408
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,980
And so I got home from Iceland
and I was like, okay, that's it.

409
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:45,440
And Lynette and I have a good friend
named Theresa and Theresa to me.

410
00:23:45,441 --> 00:23:48,590
Maybe a week after I got
back from Iceland. Karen,

411
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:53,240
a bunch of us are going to go, uh, on a,
on a trip. Do you want to come with us?

412
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:58,190
And I was like, hell no. And
I think I said something else,

413
00:23:58,191 --> 00:24:02,820
but I said, hell no, I do not want to go
on that trip. And they were like, oh no,

414
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:05,780
it'll really be fun. It's gonna be an
interesting thing. But I was like, no,

415
00:24:05,781 --> 00:24:06,351
I don't want to go on.

416
00:24:06,351 --> 00:24:11,351
The trip was overseas somewhere and then
about three months or four months goes

417
00:24:12,711 --> 00:24:17,711
by and Theresa is talking to me about
their trip and I go and I literally say to

418
00:24:18,261 --> 00:24:20,360
her, what do you mean you
guys are going on the trip?

419
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:24,470
How come you didn't invite me? And she
goes to, we did it by you. You said,

420
00:24:24,471 --> 00:24:28,340
hell no. And I said, Oh, I must've been
in my post Iceland. She goes, yeah,

421
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:29,690
you were in your post Iceland phase.

422
00:24:29,691 --> 00:24:32,660
You were not feeling like
going on that trip. So anyway,

423
00:24:32,661 --> 00:24:35,360
they all went on the trip and they were
sending me pictures from the bus and

424
00:24:35,361 --> 00:24:36,410
they're all having a good time.

425
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:40,640
And I started feeling like that fear of
missing out, like darn it, I missed out.

426
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,910
I missed out on going on that trip.
And then all of a sudden I realized,

427
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,130
you know what?
I didn't go on that trip,

428
00:24:46,131 --> 00:24:50,240
but the country they went to isn't going
anywhere. I didn't go on that trip.

429
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,370
But you know what? Look at all
these other things I got to do.

430
00:24:52,371 --> 00:24:53,660
Cause I didn't go on that trip.

431
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:57,620
And I started to see
how even in retrospect,

432
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:00,980
we look at things and we have this fear
of missing out about things that have

433
00:25:00,981 --> 00:25:03,380
already passed.
Does everyone know what I'm talking about?

434
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,180
And then we spend our mind like,
oh,

435
00:25:05,181 --> 00:25:07,460
I should have gone to that meeting where
I should've been at that party or I

436
00:25:07,461 --> 00:25:12,200
should have done this thing. And so the,
this fear of missing out, the alternative,

437
00:25:12,201 --> 00:25:16,160
the key to really giving our contribution
is to step into the joy of missing out.

438
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,050
It's like really practicing that.

439
00:25:18,051 --> 00:25:20,540
If something isn't the right
thing for us at the time,

440
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,670
we're going to have the
joy of missing out in it.

441
00:25:22,671 --> 00:25:25,730
We're going to have the joy of saying
no to the things that aren't right.

442
00:25:25,731 --> 00:25:27,650
And that saying yes to
the things that are right.

443
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:32,240
So I have a contribution challenge
for you, and here's the challenge.

444
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:38,140
It's really in the next month only
do things that are really within your

445
00:25:38,901 --> 00:25:40,010
greatest contribution.

446
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:43,580
Only do things that are really on the
path of your greatest contribution.

447
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:49,060
Only say yes to those things that really
feel like they're within your gift.

448
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,690
The gift that you have to give.
No.

449
00:25:50,691 --> 00:25:53,630
Obviously there's things your boss is
going to ask you to do that you can't say,

450
00:25:53,631 --> 00:25:57,500
Oh, I'm sorry that's not within my gift
or my contribution. I won't be doing that.

451
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,360
Yeah, don't do that. But you know,

452
00:25:59,361 --> 00:26:02,270
there's other things that you're going
to want to say yes to that really aren't.

453
00:26:02,271 --> 00:26:03,650
They're out of a fear of missing out.

454
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,760
Just say no to those things because
saying notice those things has a certain

455
00:26:07,761 --> 00:26:08,750
power to it.

456
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:13,490
That makes a huge difference when you
start moving in that direction. So that's,

457
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,100
it's one of the things I found is
when people took on this contribution

458
00:26:16,101 --> 00:26:20,420
challenge, it made a huge
difference. The other thing is that,

459
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:25,570
take a look at how you're represented
in terms of your brand in the world.

460
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:30,860
So what does that mean? Number one
in business, that means linkedin.

461
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:35,240
Take a look at your linkedin profile
and see it doesn't really represent me.

462
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:38,150
I get calls everyday from people that
asked me to work with them on their

463
00:26:38,151 --> 00:26:41,540
personal brand. First thing I do is
check out their linkedin profiles.

464
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,740
And as many of you,

465
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,440
your linkedin profile is a lot of people
like up to 77% of the people that are

466
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:49,800
going to talk to or work with you.

467
00:26:49,801 --> 00:26:51,540
We're going to check you
out on linkedin first.

468
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:56,340
So having your linkedin profile really
reflect and represent you is one of the

469
00:26:56,341 --> 00:27:01,080
key things to having your brand
in the world be solidified.

470
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:01,441
You know,

471
00:27:01,441 --> 00:27:04,890
I always tell people they should be
googling themselves at least once a month.

472
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:07,980
You'd just put your name in on Google
and Google yourself once a month and see

473
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:11,940
what comes up. You know, how are
you being represented in the world?

474
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:16,320
So your, your linkedin is one of
the places you want to think about.

475
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:21,150
How are you representing your brand?
Are you just giving a recitation of your,

476
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:24,690
everything you've done of your resume or
are you actually having a little bit of

477
00:27:24,691 --> 00:27:28,200
there in the summary of who you
are and what you contribute?

478
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,970
I don't mean writing
the archetypes in there.

479
00:27:29,971 --> 00:27:33,300
I mean talking a little bit
about what you're committed to,

480
00:27:33,301 --> 00:27:36,360
talking a little bit about what it
is you bring to the party. You know,

481
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:37,920
always tell people there's summaries.

482
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:41,670
Ought to have a little bit of that feeling
of what's the weather you bring with

483
00:27:41,671 --> 00:27:45,180
you when that's in your summary and
your Google, I mean in your linkedin,

484
00:27:45,181 --> 00:27:48,690
excuse me. Then it makes a big difference.
People can get a sense of that.

485
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,890
So one is,

486
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,970
are you represented on your linkedin in
a way where your brand really shows up?

487
00:27:53,971 --> 00:27:57,210
Because in the world we live in today,
that's one of the places people go.

488
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,790
I don't know if you all have seen
this yet, but you know now on your,

489
00:27:59,791 --> 00:28:03,010
on my calendar, on my, on my cell,

490
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:05,250
when I go to meet with somebody
I haven't met with before,

491
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:09,360
a little message will pop up that says
you're going to meet with such and such

492
00:28:09,361 --> 00:28:11,580
soon, would you like to
see their linkedin profile?

493
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,410
So it's automatically taking me to
see people's linkedin profile when I'm

494
00:28:16,411 --> 00:28:18,720
meeting with someone I haven't
met with before the or they don't,

495
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,460
it doesn't recognize this someone I know.

496
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:24,710
So that's going to be just standard and
I think in about a year that's going to

497
00:28:24,711 --> 00:28:27,240
just be built into every
calendar program everywhere,

498
00:28:27,241 --> 00:28:31,960
regardless of what you're using.
So that kind of access to people is,

499
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:35,640
is part of how our brands are getting
defined. So how do you show up online?

500
00:28:35,641 --> 00:28:36,990
What's your linkedin look like?

501
00:28:36,991 --> 00:28:40,290
That's the reason LinkedIn's important
is because it's the business to business

502
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:42,300
one.
It's the biggest business to business one.

503
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,120
But then how are you
represented on Facebook? Listen,

504
00:28:45,121 --> 00:28:50,100
I know people who have stuff on Facebook,
pictures,

505
00:28:50,101 --> 00:28:54,570
shots of taking Tequila shots as they get
out of the ocean, half dressed, right?

506
00:28:55,080 --> 00:29:00,030
Really saying really inflammatory things
politically on both sides of the aisle

507
00:29:00,031 --> 00:29:01,020
doesn't matter,
right?

508
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,870
I have people that have have stuff
on their Facebook that I'm saying,

509
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,300
do you want an employer
to really see that?

510
00:29:06,301 --> 00:29:09,030
Do you want a potential client you're
meeting with to really see that?

511
00:29:09,031 --> 00:29:12,810
Because that shaping their narrative
about you and they can find it.

512
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:17,280
So part of it is thinking about how
also do we represent ourselves online.

513
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:17,431
You know,

514
00:29:17,431 --> 00:29:21,630
I think we've gotten really loose about
just putting anything online we want on

515
00:29:21,631 --> 00:29:25,200
Facebook or Twitter. And while
there's a certain freedom to that,

516
00:29:25,201 --> 00:29:26,460
a freedom of expression,

517
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:29,670
there's also a certain consequence in
terms of how it shapes our brand in the

518
00:29:29,671 --> 00:29:30,300
world.

519
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:34,170
So it's thinking about the social media
and how are you represented in social

520
00:29:34,171 --> 00:29:37,230
media. And then the other
thing is thinking about what,

521
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:41,860
what I call these are brand projects. What
projects do you take on at work, right?

522
00:29:41,861 --> 00:29:45,430
What projects do you say yes to
that can help shape your brand?

523
00:29:45,431 --> 00:29:48,550
And what projects do you say no to?
Because they're really not on your path?

524
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:52,360
Oftentimes we don't look for those
brand projects and we need to,

525
00:29:52,361 --> 00:29:56,920
we need to look for projects at work
that help us shape that brand. You know?

526
00:29:56,921 --> 00:29:59,020
And then there's other ways
to start to build your brand,

527
00:29:59,021 --> 00:30:02,650
whether it's a podcast or
it's blogging or it's writing,

528
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,410
or it's doing articles or
it's speaking on panels.

529
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:10,660
Everyone today for their own career
has to start to think about what is my

530
00:30:10,661 --> 00:30:13,060
strategy for managing my personal brand?

531
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,400
Obviously you have to take
a few things into account.

532
00:30:15,401 --> 00:30:18,490
One is what are the policies of
your company let you do? You know,

533
00:30:18,491 --> 00:30:21,670
there's some limitations usually
with companies about what we can do.

534
00:30:21,671 --> 00:30:25,810
So given that you're operating within
those policies, what are you going to do?

535
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:29,050
The other thing is what are your gifts?
If you're a great writer,

536
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:31,390
then you should probably
to be doing some writing.

537
00:30:31,391 --> 00:30:35,020
You should probably be blogging somewhere
or at least contributing to some

538
00:30:35,021 --> 00:30:37,660
articles. If you're a great
writer, if you're a great speaker,

539
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,410
maybe you should be doing a podcast or
being interviewed on a podcast for your

540
00:30:41,411 --> 00:30:44,950
expertise or your area, right?
If you're really a good speaker,

541
00:30:44,951 --> 00:30:47,590
maybe you should be on a panel
for a conference for your area.

542
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:51,520
Those are the kinds of things that you
want to start to think about building

543
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:56,050
because they take your contribution from
being something abstract to something

544
00:30:56,051 --> 00:31:00,280
tangible. And it's one thing for us to
know what our contribution is and feel it.

545
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:04,960
It's another thing to make it tangible
in our companies and in the world,

546
00:31:04,961 --> 00:31:09,961
and so it's really on us to make sure
we're shaping our brands out in the world

547
00:31:10,121 --> 00:31:14,140
in a way where people can get it. And by
the way, when I say shaping our brands,

548
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:18,700
I don't mean lying, exaggerating, making
things up. I'm not a fan of any of that.

549
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:23,140
I'm talking about the authentic expression
of who we are and what's effective

550
00:31:23,141 --> 00:31:23,920
for us,

551
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:28,690
but to many people I see really don't
take enough effort to shape their brand

552
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,810
when they think they maybe don't need
to because of the level they're at. Two,

553
00:31:31,811 --> 00:31:34,390
they don't think they need to because
they're already gainfully employed and

554
00:31:34,391 --> 00:31:35,890
they're not looking for another job.

555
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:40,030
But the reality is is those things
do start to shape our brand.

556
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,510
I'll give you one really simple example.
This was years ago,

557
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,400
a friend of mine told me this story.

558
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:48,010
She used to work in a company with
a woman and the woman was, you know,

559
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:50,470
like a mid level manager
in a fortune 500 company.

560
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,890
Her name was Susan and Susan would get
in the elevator and oftentimes just

561
00:31:53,891 --> 00:31:57,370
because of the the floor she was
on and the timing of her meetings,

562
00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:00,010
she would often find herself
in the elevator with this,

563
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,670
with the CEO of the company. Say, Susan,
how are you today? I'm fine. How are you?

564
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:06,520
It's good. How's everything going? It's
good. I was a little rainy today. Oh,

565
00:32:06,521 --> 00:32:09,970
it was snowing today and that was
the degree of their conversation.

566
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,270
And then Susan started working on a
personal brand and she said one day she

567
00:32:13,271 --> 00:32:18,271
realized that how she must seem to
the CEO is like the weather girl.

568
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:22,780
Cause every time he asked her how she was,
that's what she talked about.

569
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,690
So she started to get in the elevator and
he would say, Susan, how are you today?

570
00:32:25,691 --> 00:32:27,940
And she goes, I'm great. And he'd go,
really? That's good. And she'd go, yeah,

571
00:32:27,941 --> 00:32:30,490
my team and I are working on
a really fabulous project.

572
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,030
And every time she saw the CEO she
would just do a little bit like that.

573
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:37,900
And within a few months she said she had
been invited to be on a task team that

574
00:32:37,901 --> 00:32:42,800
he was running for a major initiative in
the organization cause she reshaped his

575
00:32:42,801 --> 00:32:46,430
experience of her.
He reshaped his experience of her brand.

576
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:50,600
So while we're not trying to do anything
again that's exaggerating or lying,

577
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:53,600
we're trying to be authentic. It's
important to be authentic in our brands.

578
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,870
We have to do it in a way
where other people can get it.

579
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:00,500
If they can't get it and get the message,
there's no real point to it.

580
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:04,160
So just remember that it's not enough
for you to know what the weather is you

581
00:33:04,161 --> 00:33:08,720
bring with you. You have to translate it
into ways that the people you work with,

582
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,750
that the people in the outside
world can actually see,

583
00:33:11,751 --> 00:33:15,320
can actually feel that starts to
create that narrative about yourself.

584
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,660
So here's the thing I
want to leave you with.

585
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:22,100
It's not what you know that's important.
It's knowing what's important.

586
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,560
That's what makes a difference
is knowing what's important.

587
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:26,990
It's not the script that you follow,

588
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:30,440
it's really the script that you
write for yourself. And lastly,

589
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,210
it isn't really the,
whether you find,

590
00:33:32,211 --> 00:33:35,570
but the weather you bring with you
that makes the biggest difference.

591
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:39,440
So thank you very much for your
time and your attention. Thank you.

592
00:33:39,441 --> 00:33:40,550
It's been a pleasure to be here

593
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:46,040
and I'm going to take some questions.

594
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:51,220
So please anybody have any questions about
anything about any aspect of personal

595
00:33:51,231 --> 00:33:55,550
branding? I think we have Mike's right
there, right? Is that where the Mikes are?

596
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,530
Okay. Fantastic. Yes, please.

597
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:01,810
Um, so you talk about like kind of
projecting internally what you bring,

598
00:34:01,811 --> 00:34:05,050
but I was just wondering if you have any
advice around just understanding what

599
00:34:05,051 --> 00:34:06,400
you're projecting to other people.

600
00:34:06,401 --> 00:34:09,580
So I think like we can
know ourselves very well,

601
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:12,760
but knowing also what other people see
and getting feedback on that to make sure

602
00:34:12,761 --> 00:34:13,560
that we're,

603
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:17,580
yeah, that's a great question because
here's what happens is it's like you said,

604
00:34:17,581 --> 00:34:20,760
we, we, we think we know
how we're coming across,

605
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:24,030
but I always say you can't see the
inside of your own eyelids. Right?

606
00:34:24,031 --> 00:34:26,120
It's really hard to tell. So I
think one of the things, there's,

607
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,410
there's a couple of ways to do that.
One is to,

608
00:34:28,411 --> 00:34:31,500
to have people that you trust
and you trust not only their,

609
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:34,830
the way they look at you and you know,
their ability to see you,

610
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,040
but you trust that there'll be
honest with you and you can ask them,

611
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:40,980
how do you think I came across and that
meeting? What do you think my brand is?

612
00:34:40,981 --> 00:34:41,130
You know,

613
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:44,610
one of things I always tell all new
clients to do is I tell them to go talk to

614
00:34:44,611 --> 00:34:46,020
six people they know and say,

615
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,110
if you were to just give me a few
descriptions of what you think my personal

616
00:34:49,111 --> 00:34:52,200
brand are, what are they? And
people often come back and go,

617
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,180
they're shocked at how consistent it is.

618
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:57,540
That's what people are shocked at is
how does six different people from six

619
00:34:57,541 --> 00:35:02,010
different places know that the shortcut
to this by the way is ask your spouse or

620
00:35:02,011 --> 00:35:05,760
your boyfriend or girlfriend because
they always know. They always know.

621
00:35:05,761 --> 00:35:08,910
So that's one thing is really what is,
you can ask the people that you know,

622
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:13,110
you can also be more formal and actually
when you get your 360 [inaudible] are,

623
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,490
when you do something like that,

624
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:17,940
you can ask people to give you their
impression of what your personal brand is

625
00:35:17,941 --> 00:35:22,620
as an additional sort of piece of that.
But it is important to get that feedback.

626
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:25,740
The thing is you have to establish a
relationship with people where they're

627
00:35:25,741 --> 00:35:27,840
going to be honest about
giving you that feedback.

628
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:31,920
And that means no consequences.
So you have to say to people,

629
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:35,370
you can say anything that you really
see and there will be no consequences.

630
00:35:35,371 --> 00:35:38,550
I won't hold it against you.
I bring it up, et cetera.

631
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,690
That's one really good way to do it. Yeah.
Thank you. What else? Other questions?

632
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,300
Yes.

633
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,770
One. Um, what about people
I've seen a lot lately.

634
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:50,400
People that rebrand their name,
their own name themselves. So we,

635
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:55,050
I see a lot of executives that all of a
sudden their signatures signed off with

636
00:35:55,051 --> 00:35:57,150
the shorter different name.

637
00:35:57,151 --> 00:36:00,300
I've got friends that are lawyers that
now call themselves slightly different

638
00:36:00,301 --> 00:36:04,650
version of the name. Cause I think like
for example, one light, her name's Kate,

639
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:07,850
she now calls herself Katie and
everyone has to call herself Katie.

640
00:36:07,851 --> 00:36:09,030
Like what's your take on,

641
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,930
I think like our executive teams seem
to do this branding training and they've

642
00:36:12,931 --> 00:36:15,540
all got different names.
Like what's your take on pit?

643
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:19,860
Like I've always thought like you
can't choose the keycard people.

644
00:36:19,861 --> 00:36:20,560
It has to be honest.

645
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,100
God gave you that name.
Yeah, stick with it.

646
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,840
It doesn't feel authentic.

647
00:36:24,841 --> 00:36:27,720
So what do you teach that or
like what's your take on that?

648
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:31,160
No, I'm, what's your name? My
name is Brent. Brent? Yeah.

649
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,220
Cause we could make you the big bay.
Yeah,

650
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:38,960
no I don't generally teach that people
change their name unless they have a

651
00:36:38,961 --> 00:36:42,380
really a name that's problematic.
So I had a woman who called me in,

652
00:36:42,381 --> 00:36:46,700
her company was named Oak Hitting Isis
and it was a healthcare company and she

653
00:36:46,701 --> 00:36:48,290
called me because she was
very upset cause she says,

654
00:36:48,291 --> 00:36:51,050
I've had this name of my company for
20 years and I don't want to change it.

655
00:36:51,051 --> 00:36:54,710
I'm like, look, I'm sorry, but
there's just no way around this one.

656
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:57,170
You are going to have to change
the name of your company.

657
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,380
So are there times when you
have to change your name? Yes,

658
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:04,040
but I'm not in general a fan.
I'm not criticizing anyone.

659
00:37:04,041 --> 00:37:05,720
If that's what they want to do,
that's fine.

660
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:09,290
I don't think that really
what rebranding is about.

661
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:11,570
To me that's kind of a
shallow way to rebrand.

662
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:14,900
I think what real rebranding is
about is when you've discovered,

663
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,540
it's like I used to have a friend that
used to say before you can have a new

664
00:37:17,541 --> 00:37:21,710
reputation, you have to be responsible
for the reputation you have currently.

665
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:24,200
So to me what real
rebranding is is when you,

666
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,890
you realize you have a certain reputation
and it's not what you want and it's

667
00:37:27,891 --> 00:37:32,510
time to really make some deep changes
in yourself and externally to that.

668
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:36,350
So I think sometimes people do,
and I don't know any of these people,

669
00:37:36,351 --> 00:37:37,910
so I'm not saying they've done that.

670
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:41,270
But I think sometimes what people do is
they try to fix their brand with a name

671
00:37:41,271 --> 00:37:45,440
change or a logo change or just changing.
Like I used to wear blue jackets,

672
00:37:45,441 --> 00:37:48,590
now I'm wearing red jackets. Do
you know? And all of that's fine.

673
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:51,170
But that isn't really
what makes an impact.

674
00:37:51,171 --> 00:37:53,900
That isn't really the depth of branding
that really makes a difference.

675
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,210
So I think the problem is
when we try to rebrand,

676
00:37:56,211 --> 00:37:59,600
rebrand in a shallow way or we try
to rebrand just on the surface,

677
00:37:59,601 --> 00:38:03,380
I guess would be a better way to say it.
When we try to brand on the surface,

678
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:05,960
it lacks a certain impact than depth.

679
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,540
And you run the risk of
seeming an authentic.

680
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:12,110
And that's the problem with
that kind of surface rebranding.

681
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:14,690
Does that make sense? Yeah,
it's a great question. Please.

682
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,343
Hi.
Um,

683
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,840
I'm curious if in your research you found,
um,

684
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:27,060
a couple insights about vulnerability
because you're calling us to be authentic

685
00:38:27,481 --> 00:38:30,960
to Kinda like put ourselves out
there and be more open to scrutiny.

686
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:32,610
So I'm kind of wondering how,

687
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,890
if that surfacing your research
and does that play out?

688
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:36,791
That's first of all,

689
00:38:36,791 --> 00:38:40,330
that's such a great question and that
absolutely surfaced in my research.

690
00:38:40,331 --> 00:38:45,331
So how many people here have seen Bernay
Brown's Tedx talk of the Houston Tedx

691
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:48,660
talk on the power of vulnerability and,
but he seen that in here. If you haven't,

692
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:51,790
I want to highly recommend that.
That's a really powerful video,

693
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:55,630
but similar to what Bernay Brown
is talking about. In that video,

694
00:38:55,631 --> 00:38:59,830
I found that the people that had
the strongest personal brands,

695
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,300
positive personal brands,

696
00:39:01,301 --> 00:39:04,900
let me qualify it like that cause
there can be negative personal brands,

697
00:39:04,901 --> 00:39:08,650
but people that had the strongest
positive personal brands where people that

698
00:39:08,651 --> 00:39:12,970
were seen as being authentic and what
made them authentic was their humility and

699
00:39:12,971 --> 00:39:17,140
their vulnerability. So they were
willing to say, I made that mistake,

700
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:20,740
I screwed that up.
I'm trying to do this and I failed at it.

701
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,890
I they didn't look like they
were all together. Like, Oh,

702
00:39:23,891 --> 00:39:26,950
I've had it all together and everything's
perfect in my life and you know,

703
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:30,880
I have 2.7 kids and my marriage is
fabulous and don't I look great.

704
00:39:30,881 --> 00:39:33,910
They didn't have that. They were
really willing to say, I'm struggling.

705
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:36,730
I'm struggling with my kids.
I'm struggling with my marriage.

706
00:39:36,731 --> 00:39:39,760
I'm struggling in my job. I'm having
a trouble with this particular part.

707
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:43,240
I don't mean they were dumping it
on people, but they were really,

708
00:39:43,241 --> 00:39:48,241
really willing to be authentic and honest
and vulnerable about their struggles.

709
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:51,370
How many of you, when you, you
work with somebody or you know,

710
00:39:51,371 --> 00:39:54,310
somebody who's willing to be authentic
with you about their struggles,

711
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:57,880
you actually feel more connected to
that person when they share that.

712
00:39:57,881 --> 00:40:00,190
How many people have had that experience?
Just raise your hands.

713
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,790
And it's so funny cause I think we're
afraid that's going to drive people away.

714
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,840
But in my research,

715
00:40:04,841 --> 00:40:08,530
what I found is that people who are
willing to embrace that vulnerability,

716
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,150
that's what made them authentic.

717
00:40:10,151 --> 00:40:13,810
And that's what made other people
able to connect with them and with,

718
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:14,890
with their brands.

719
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:17,980
And they were actually more able to
make their contribution out of that

720
00:40:17,981 --> 00:40:22,810
vulnerability than less able to make it.
So yeah, it's a great question. Thank you.

721
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:26,850
What else? Other questions
please. Hi, my name is Brooke.

722
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:31,390
Thanks for being here. Pleasure. Um,
kind of a tag along question to that.

723
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:34,930
At what point is an overshare
nausea and at what point?

724
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:40,300
Certainly taboo subject,
right? For example, like
relationship issues, addiction,

725
00:40:40,301 --> 00:40:43,210
something like what if you want
to share that openly and brightly.

726
00:40:43,211 --> 00:40:46,070
But that is such a great
question. Well, one thing is I'll,

727
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:49,750
I'll tell you a little story,
which is somebody I was,

728
00:40:49,751 --> 00:40:52,660
when I was writing my last book, the,
the brand mapping strategy books,

729
00:40:52,661 --> 00:40:54,010
somebody called me and
they told me the story.

730
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:55,790
They told me to go online
and look at this thing up in,

731
00:40:55,791 --> 00:41:00,610
this woman had been on Facebook and she
had been sharing about some guy she had

732
00:41:00,611 --> 00:41:03,820
dated the night before and it
was very explicit and whatever,

733
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:07,240
I won't tell you any details. It was
cause that would be oversharing. Um,

734
00:41:07,241 --> 00:41:11,500
it was very explicit.
And then somebody else said to her,

735
00:41:11,501 --> 00:41:14,350
why are you putting this publicly
on Facebook? And she goes, oh no,

736
00:41:14,351 --> 00:41:16,600
I thought I was sharing it in the
private area. And they go, no,

737
00:41:16,601 --> 00:41:20,020
you're sharing it publicly. Everyone can
see this. And it became this whole thing.

738
00:41:20,021 --> 00:41:23,830
And she actually got fired from her job
because her clients saw it and it was

739
00:41:23,831 --> 00:41:25,810
pretty risque stuff.

740
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:31,380
So I think one thing is I see a lot of
sharing on Facebook that when I see it,

741
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:35,600
I cringe and I go,
that's too much information.

742
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:39,710
That's oversharing because anybody
can see it, a client can see it,

743
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,500
an employer can see it, so we used
to have this thing we used to say,

744
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:47,300
which is don't put anything in
public on the Facebook, Twitter,

745
00:41:47,301 --> 00:41:49,130
whatever.
Don't put anything out there in public.

746
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:53,150
You wouldn't want printed on the
front page of the New York Times.

747
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:56,570
So when it comes to social media,
that's one of the ways to think about it.

748
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,060
How would I feel if this was on the
front page of the New York Times?

749
00:41:59,061 --> 00:42:02,360
Would I be okay with that? If you
would be, then put it, if you wouldn't,

750
00:42:02,361 --> 00:42:05,300
then don't. I think when it
comes to the personal sharing,

751
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:08,780
I think you have to make a distinction
and the distinction is the relationship,

752
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:12,890
the container of the relationship you
have with the person. In other words,

753
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,120
is this person a coworker,

754
00:42:14,121 --> 00:42:17,210
but they're also a friend and
you talk about personal things.

755
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:20,150
I think when there's that container,
then it's fine.

756
00:42:20,151 --> 00:42:23,750
Especially if you have a confidentiality
agreement to share those things with

757
00:42:23,751 --> 00:42:26,510
each other. I think when the
container is that your coworkers,

758
00:42:26,511 --> 00:42:28,280
but you're not really personal friends,

759
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:32,360
you have to think about is
that information something
that's going to burden the

760
00:42:32,361 --> 00:42:35,540
person because they're going to feel like
they have to keep it from other people.

761
00:42:35,541 --> 00:42:39,260
So you're now putting a burden on them
or is it something that's going to affect

762
00:42:39,261 --> 00:42:43,820
their relationship with you in a
way that's negative or difficult?

763
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:47,300
So I think part of it is it's,
it's really a case by case basis,

764
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:51,290
but we have a big problem in today's
world with oversharing. I mean,

765
00:42:51,291 --> 00:42:53,840
how many of you go on Facebook
sometimes and you literally go,

766
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:57,200
why did that person put that on
Facebook? You, you wonder that,

767
00:42:57,201 --> 00:42:59,810
how many people view of you
have wondered that? I mean,

768
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:02,000
I could give you so many more
examples and it's, you know,

769
00:43:02,001 --> 00:43:03,980
now we've got people showing
videos of things and I'm like,

770
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:08,450
why are they putting that video on
Facebook? Right. Does that help? Yeah,

771
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,090
it's very good. Thank you.
Other questions, please?

772
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,650
Um, so I've been thinking a lot about, um,

773
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:19,040
juggling kind of an aspirational personal
brand and something that you really

774
00:43:19,041 --> 00:43:23,600
actually haven't done yet. Um, I feel
like a couple of my peers would say, well,

775
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:27,680
I'm a marathon runner. And you'd say, Oh,
well what marathons have you run in the,

776
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:31,220
well, you know, I'm training for one or
you know, I'm a community architect. Well,

777
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:32,690
what communities have you built?

778
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:37,930
And so it's not dishonest because
there's a genuine desire to get to that.

779
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:41,810
Um, but it just ends up feeling a
little shallow and without integrity,

780
00:43:41,811 --> 00:43:45,860
even though they do have the skills or
they're working towards getting to that

781
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:47,810
brand. Right. That makes sense.

782
00:43:47,811 --> 00:43:52,340
So how would you recommend kind of working
towards something and trying to get

783
00:43:52,341 --> 00:43:55,780
yourselves into yourself
into that next step? Um,

784
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:59,510
while not being kind of dishonest and
kind of seems like it's, it's lying.

785
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:01,341
Yes.

786
00:44:01,341 --> 00:44:06,200
That's a great question because we have
a lot of things get hyped up today,

787
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:09,650
right? We hype things up. Like people
say, I'm a writer really? Well,

788
00:44:09,651 --> 00:44:14,420
what have you written? Well, nothing,
but I'm writing, you know, so it's like,

789
00:44:14,421 --> 00:44:18,080
I think part of it is we've lost that
distinction of of what those achievements

790
00:44:18,081 --> 00:44:21,230
are. So I think part of it
is you really just said it.

791
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,560
It's being honest with people.
I don't think you need to say I a member.

792
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:27,620
The thing about roles,
marathon runners, a role,

793
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:30,910
you don't have to identify
yourself by that role to say kind.

794
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:35,190
One of my projects this year is I'm,
I'm training to run a marathon, right?

795
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:36,990
I'm really,
really into the athletics is sure.

796
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:39,000
I'm really trying to have a
breakthrough in my athletic ability.

797
00:44:39,001 --> 00:44:42,450
I'm training to run a marathon.
You don't have to give yourself the label.

798
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:44,250
And I think we are B again.

799
00:44:44,251 --> 00:44:47,400
I think part of it is we get into this
thing this day where we feel like we have

800
00:44:47,401 --> 00:44:52,200
to label everything. I'm a writer,
I'm a marathon runner, I'm an artist,

801
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:53,063
whatever it is.

802
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,640
And part of it is if we can let go
of the identification with the role,

803
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,270
then we can talk about it from the
point of view of what we're learning.

804
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:05,520
You know, I'm, I'm studying Spanish, you
know, I'm learning to run a marathon.

805
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:10,230
You know, I'm, what was the other
example you gave? Yeah, I'm,

806
00:45:10,231 --> 00:45:13,440
I'm studying how to be a community
architect or I'm really passionate about

807
00:45:13,441 --> 00:45:14,550
community architecture.

808
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:17,730
We don't have to have ourselves
in a fixed position as the role.

809
00:45:17,731 --> 00:45:20,790
Does that make sense?
And part of what happens with,

810
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:24,330
with social media is we get encouraged
to categorize ourselves a lot.

811
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:26,280
We get encouraged to categorize ourselves.

812
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,890
I can check the boxes for
all of the different things.

813
00:45:28,891 --> 00:45:30,450
Like that's what our brand is.

814
00:45:30,451 --> 00:45:33,930
And what I'm saying is our brand
isn't really those roles. It's,

815
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:37,470
it's what we bring to it. It's what
we can tribute. I got for myself.

816
00:45:37,471 --> 00:45:39,330
Like I consider myself a lifelong learner.

817
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,310
I'm always going to be learning something.

818
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:45,540
When I was in my forties I took up
tap dancing. I wasn't very good at it,

819
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:49,350
but I would never say I'm a tap dancer.
No one would ever say that.

820
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:52,770
But I would say to feel I'm, I'm
studying tap dancing. It's really fun.

821
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:56,700
I'm learning a lot because I didn't have
to be identified in the role. Right.

822
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,690
So it's like it's a matter of what, like
right now I'm learning to make jewelry,

823
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,260
but I would never say my, I would
never call myself a jeweler. I could,

824
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:05,280
but I wouldn't because it's,

825
00:46:05,281 --> 00:46:07,620
I don't need to be identified with that
role right now. It's just like, oh,

826
00:46:07,621 --> 00:46:10,080
I'm learning something new. I'm
learning to make jewelry. How Fun.

827
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:13,740
So I think part of it is we want to
get everything kind of like box down to

828
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,220
these are our seven roles and these are
the seven roles are what define who we

829
00:46:17,221 --> 00:46:18,360
are.
And it's the,

830
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:22,020
and what I'm saying is the opposite is
the roles aren't really what we are,

831
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:22,861
it's the quality.

832
00:46:22,861 --> 00:46:25,860
So maybe the quality for the person
running the marathon is challenging

833
00:46:25,861 --> 00:46:26,694
themselves.

834
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:30,330
So the thing to talk about is I love
to challenge myself and my new way,

835
00:46:30,331 --> 00:46:33,240
I'm challenging myself as I'm running,
I'm learning to run marathons.

836
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:34,260
Does that make sense?

837
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:38,610
Because then you're focusing on the
quality rather than the role itself.

838
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:42,000
And that's a really key point because
we do tend to lead with our roles.

839
00:46:42,001 --> 00:46:45,990
We tend to lead with our resumes,
like that's our brand and it's not,

840
00:46:45,991 --> 00:46:50,280
or that that's our contribution
and it's not. Well,

841
00:46:50,281 --> 00:46:52,290
I really want to thank you
for your time and attention.

842
00:46:52,291 --> 00:46:55,140
I know how hard it is to get away from
work and come to something like this.

843
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:57,930
So thank you for your time.
