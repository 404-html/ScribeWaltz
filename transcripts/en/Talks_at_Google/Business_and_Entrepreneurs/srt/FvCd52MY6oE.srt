1
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,710
Hi everyone. Welcome to talks at
Google and it's great to have Sandy,

2
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:15,360
Jen co founder and Cto of
honor here with us today.

3
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,990
Sandy founded honor in 2014 and prior
to that she was cofounder and Cto of

4
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:23,311
Meebo,

5
00:00:23,311 --> 00:00:28,311
which is a customer internet company
that focused on connecting publishers and

6
00:00:29,191 --> 00:00:34,191
consumers socially and she led their
engineering team and then join Google

7
00:00:34,921 --> 00:00:36,240
actually,
uh,

8
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,540
in the social team when a Meebo was
acquired in 2012 and before that she also

9
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:47,910
got her bs from Stanford
University in computer science.

10
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,590
So it's great to have you with
us today, Sandy. Great fear.

11
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,860
I like to get started by having you
tell us about what honor is in your own

12
00:00:55,861 --> 00:00:56,350
words.

13
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,900
Sure. Um, so honor, uh,

14
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:02,890
our mission basically is to change
the way that our parents age. Um,

15
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,880
I think aging is a topic that a lot
of us don't talk about with people,

16
00:01:06,881 --> 00:01:11,010
especially our own parents. Um, there's
a bit of sort of child fear, um,

17
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:13,450
when talking about, uh, issues like that.

18
00:01:13,451 --> 00:01:18,420
And so honors goal really is to
remake the way that folks can, uh,

19
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:22,300
age at home specifically. Um, so we
really focus on nonmedical home care,

20
00:01:22,301 --> 00:01:25,370
which means that we help folks with a,
what we call Adl.

21
00:01:25,371 --> 00:01:28,810
So activities of daily living, things
that you and I take for granted, you know,

22
00:01:28,811 --> 00:01:31,890
brushing your teeth, getting out
of bed. I went to the bathroom. Um,

23
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,620
and we have a whole host of,
um,

24
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,820
really awesome care professionals
that go and do that work.

25
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,100
And what inspired you and
your team to start? Honor?

26
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,690
Uh, good question. Um, so, uh, uh,

27
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:47,750
three of the four founders are multiterm
entrepreneurs and so we've, um,

28
00:01:47,751 --> 00:01:49,630
we all kind of cut her
teeth on social media. Um,

29
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:54,530
I've actually had been at
Google for a little bit, um,
and we, uh, once we sort of,

30
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,500
you know,

31
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,730
so all those companies and sort of took
a little time off and we merely wanted

32
00:01:58,731 --> 00:02:00,650
to do another venture and we
really wanted to think about, okay,

33
00:02:00,651 --> 00:02:04,040
well what would make us really
want to work hard, like really,

34
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:08,870
really hard because the startups
are a lot of work. Um, and, uh,

35
00:02:08,871 --> 00:02:11,120
we ended up sort of thinking
about what's important to us.

36
00:02:11,121 --> 00:02:13,330
And we were a little bit older
or a little bit more chairs,

37
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,850
some of us were having kids. Um,
and we really wanted to have impact.

38
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:21,860
That was like the biggest thing. And so,
um, when we were kind of getting together,

39
00:02:21,861 --> 00:02:23,240
we kind of thought about, okay, well what,

40
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,190
like what are big problems
that we could solve?

41
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,130
And we thought about unemployment,
poverty, you know, Labor, uh,

42
00:02:30,131 --> 00:02:33,620
child care, health care, elder care. Um,

43
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:37,670
and then my cofounder from
evo went home one day, um,

44
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,510
to Connecticut to visit
his mother. And she, uh,

45
00:02:41,511 --> 00:02:44,780
he likes to tell the story that she
gets speeding tickets in Montana,

46
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:49,450
which you just don't get cause cause
there's nobody monitoring center.

47
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,100
The freeways in Montana.
And she was driving really slowly.

48
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,770
And so he started to get a little freaked
out about like, wait a minute. Like,

49
00:02:54,771 --> 00:02:56,750
why are you driving so slowly?
And she was like, well,

50
00:02:56,751 --> 00:03:00,130
it's just getting a little harder. And
so he's like, I live in California,

51
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:03,540
you live in east coast, you know, when
you're older, what am I going to do? Um,

52
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,590
I know I don't want to pluck
you away from your house.

53
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,320
And so that sort of spurred the idea.

54
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:13,000
We kind of really started to do some
research in caring for seniors and it's a

55
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:14,710
really, really big space. Um,

56
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:19,630
and then we really honed
in on the nonmedical a home
aspect of it because it was

57
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,980
very broken. Um, and when you find him
that's really broken as an entrepreneur,

58
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:26,290
you kind of get really excited cause
you're like, oh, what can I help?

59
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,680
What can I do to fix this? Um, and so
we kind of started explore that idea.

60
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:34,000
How do you feel like your experience
working on Meebo in the social space has

61
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:35,740
influenced your work here with honor?

62
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:36,880
Um,

63
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:41,880
so I would say doing a previous or prior
startup to doing honor was definitely a

64
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:48,010
Prereq to do this type of
venture. Um, honor is complicated.

65
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,570
Like home care aid, you're touching
people directly. Uh, it's a very,

66
00:03:52,571 --> 00:03:55,690
very, uh, hands on experience. Um,

67
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,440
and so in order to solve
such a big mission,

68
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:03,400
you need to sort of know how
to execute, how to, you know,

69
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,050
gather resources higher,

70
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,200
like a lot of the sort of nuts and bolts
that I learned in my first startup.

71
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,560
And so my experience at Meebo really
sort of taught me generally how to form

72
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:16,850
organizations, how to run
a team, how to hire. Um,

73
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,180
there are a lot of mistakes
we made in Meebo, which, um,

74
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,460
as an entrepreneur are
selfishly for a second venture.

75
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:24,730
I want to feel to not make
the same mistakes twice. Um,

76
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:27,160
so it was a good opportunity to just kind
of take all the learnings that we had,

77
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:32,200
um, sort of gathered in our previous
experiences and then, you know,

78
00:04:32,201 --> 00:04:36,700
really consolidate all that learning
into a new venture. Um, and so,

79
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:37,600
so far it's worked out really well.

80
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,500
And how long have you guys been
available to consumers? Actually,

81
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,930
so we started, uh, we're
about three years old,

82
00:04:43,931 --> 00:04:48,570
but we've been giving care for about
two. Um, and so the first year,

83
00:04:48,571 --> 00:04:52,470
obviously a lot of us didn't know much
about home care. Um, like I, you know,

84
00:04:52,471 --> 00:04:56,170
I had some personal experiences
with, with my grandparents, but, um,

85
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,100
really digging into the industry.
It's been around for a really long time.

86
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,960
It hasn't changed much in 30 years,

87
00:05:00,961 --> 00:05:05,961
but there are a lot of
nuances and complications and
considerations in home care

88
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:12,750
that, uh, without really doing it,
you don't really get exposed to it.

89
00:05:12,751 --> 00:05:16,080
And so the first year for us was a ton
of learning and then we started to take

90
00:05:16,081 --> 00:05:17,250
those learnings and execute on them.

91
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,541
Okay.
Prior to the interview,

92
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:22,560
I was just reading on this market and
it's actually like a huge business

93
00:05:22,561 --> 00:05:27,460
opportunity in terms of how much money
people spend on home care and here,

94
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,080
but it's something that I don't think
tech has addressed up to this point.

95
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,220
Why do you think that is?

96
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,410
Yeah, so it's, it's interesting
cause people think technology,

97
00:05:35,411 --> 00:05:38,420
they think old people and they're
like, this is just don't mix. Um,

98
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,930
and the way we've thought
about it is, um, you know,

99
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,810
if you think about your grandparents
or your loved ones who are older,

100
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:48,730
like they use microwaves and
twisters and TVs and cars. Um,

101
00:05:48,731 --> 00:05:52,870
and that's all technology, but it's
not in their face as like technology.

102
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:57,900
And so you had to sort of rethink about
how you use tech to address needs for

103
00:05:59,871 --> 00:06:01,760
that kind of audience.
And so for us,

104
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:05,420
I think there's just been that stigma
I think in silicon valley and just

105
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:10,421
generally in technology and as a
whole that seniors don't do well with

106
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:13,790
technology. Um, and I think
there's always been these,

107
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:18,200
I think it's a mistake to
kind of overcater to a senior
audience by having like

108
00:06:18,201 --> 00:06:20,870
giant buttons and like
giant Font and you know,

109
00:06:20,871 --> 00:06:23,030
basically treating them as children,
um,

110
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,550
without really understanding what the
root problem you're trying to solve.

111
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:29,780
And so we definitely don't think of
ourselves as a technology company like

112
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:32,000
honors specifically positioned
itself as a services company.

113
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:34,790
Because at the end of the day,
our product is a person. Um,

114
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:38,060
and I say this very often that
we are a human services company,

115
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:42,260
like the person that we send to your
home to help, you know, you do your, uh,

116
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,510
activities of daily living.
That's our product.

117
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,230
And so all the technology that we
build, um, is in service of that.

118
00:06:48,231 --> 00:06:51,680
So a lot of stuff that we build,
the end consumer never sees,

119
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,400
but it's completely built to
deliver the best care possible.

120
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:59,160
What was the hardest part of the process
as you were starting out with this

121
00:06:59,161 --> 00:06:59,994
company?

122
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:04,390
Um, I think, uh, as technologists,

123
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:06,300
you have this sort of,
uh,

124
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:10,750
want to automate everything and make
everything really efficient. Um,

125
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:14,590
and so you come in with a blog, a bunch
of assumptions. And so as engineers,

126
00:07:14,591 --> 00:07:15,960
we're like, okay, we're just
going to build this thing.

127
00:07:15,961 --> 00:07:18,010
We're going to build that thing. This is
the way it works. You just go to visit,

128
00:07:18,011 --> 00:07:20,560
you do this, you do that, and then
when you actually start to do it,

129
00:07:20,561 --> 00:07:23,830
we all ended up volunteering in senior
homes to help out and you're like, wow,

130
00:07:23,831 --> 00:07:28,290
that's not, that's not
how it is. Um, and so, uh,

131
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:33,170
we had to basically learn to strip
away all of our assumptions. Um,

132
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,890
and, uh, in the very beginning, you know,

133
00:07:35,891 --> 00:07:40,120
we had folks who were running care and
delivering care and working with our care,

134
00:07:40,121 --> 00:07:41,410
our care professionals.
Um,

135
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:44,500
and they were kind of doing one thing
and then the engineers and product team,

136
00:07:44,501 --> 00:07:46,480
we're kind of doing another thing and
we were trying to build things for each

137
00:07:46,481 --> 00:07:50,610
other, but we weren't really in sync
as much as we should have been. Um,

138
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,230
and I think that's a common problem
because you make assumptions,

139
00:07:53,231 --> 00:07:55,240
you work one way,
you make some geo work one way,

140
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,990
but at the end of the day you really
have to work together, like really,

141
00:07:58,991 --> 00:08:01,060
really together to
understand what's going on.

142
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:05,110
And so once we kind of figured out that
we were not building the right thing, um,

143
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,770
that sort of changed the course
of how we did product development,

144
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:13,540
which I think is different than what
you'd find in a more traditional software

145
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:16,900
technology company. Um, we really had
to sort of rethink how we did that.

146
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,530
You mentioned that you went
to visit some senior homes.

147
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,490
What else did you do in terms of use or
research or validating the product and

148
00:08:24,491 --> 00:08:25,810
getting feedback on the product?

149
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:30,770
Yeah, so we knew we didn't know
anything really. So, um, and uh,

150
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,880
if you think about home care,
it's basically two sided.

151
00:08:32,881 --> 00:08:34,650
You have Washington multi-sided,

152
00:08:34,651 --> 00:08:37,710
you have the person receiving the
care so that the recipient of the care

153
00:08:37,711 --> 00:08:41,770
recipient who could be older or have
different medical conditions, um,

154
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,220
you have usually a family member.
Um,

155
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,890
sometimes not who might be the one
responsible for helping care for the,

156
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:52,260
the, the senior. Um, and then you have the
person who was actually doing the care.

157
00:08:52,261 --> 00:08:55,150
So the care professional, um, they're
traditionally called caregivers,

158
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:58,930
but we really wanted to
raise their profile. Um,

159
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,830
and so we there and the work
they do is really difficult.

160
00:09:01,831 --> 00:09:04,170
So we actually called the
care professionals, um,

161
00:09:04,171 --> 00:09:07,440
and then care pros for short to give them
sort of more of the respect that they

162
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:12,000
actually deserve. Um, and so we
had to basically talk to everybody.

163
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:16,170
So we, we put herself out of the bay area
cause a barrier is kind of weird. Um,

164
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,760
as you won't know,
it's a little bit of a bubble.

165
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,910
So we went to like different areas,
talk to different care pros, you know,

166
00:09:20,911 --> 00:09:23,640
asking them sort of, you know,
what does it you do, you know,

167
00:09:23,641 --> 00:09:28,350
what's hard in your life? Um, why
do you do this work? Um, you know,

168
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:32,460
they could, a lot of folks who at this
wage level could literally make more,

169
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,260
you know,
flipping burgers at Mcdonald's,

170
00:09:34,261 --> 00:09:36,450
but they choose to do this work because
they really care. So it's like, like,

171
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:40,370
why are you making a decision? I'm like,
what are the hardships in your life? Um,

172
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:44,520
why do you work for this
agency and not that agency? Um,

173
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:49,521
and so just really being open to
understanding how their thinking.

174
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,510
Um, and then when you start to get
the same answers over and over again,

175
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,510
then you start to think, okay, now
I'm seeing a pattern and trend.

176
00:09:57,511 --> 00:10:01,320
And that can then inform the product
that you build and how you want to create

177
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,950
that interaction.
Hmm.

178
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,330
Your comment about the wages that the
caregivers are earning reminded me that I

179
00:10:07,331 --> 00:10:12,331
saw the CNN article that mentioned
that in 2016 you transitioned from a

180
00:10:12,371 --> 00:10:14,680
contractor model to an employee model.

181
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:18,820
Is that something that continues to
today and why they choose to do that?

182
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,250
I think in the beginning were like,
all right,

183
00:10:20,251 --> 00:10:22,350
we're just going to kind of try the
contractor model because you know,

184
00:10:22,351 --> 00:10:25,140
that's sort of, it seems to easiest. Um,

185
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:29,430
and so we started recruiting people and
then it turns out that there are certain

186
00:10:29,431 --> 00:10:32,730
restrictions in a contractor
model that you, uh, for example,

187
00:10:32,731 --> 00:10:34,950
can't train your folks very well.
Um,

188
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,930
there are certain
limitations on the amount of,

189
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,810
um, sort of personal interaction
you can have with them.

190
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:46,350
And so the one of our core
tenants has always been,

191
00:10:46,351 --> 00:10:49,620
if you could treat the care pro better
and put them in a better place in their

192
00:10:49,621 --> 00:10:52,020
lives, they'll be able to do their
jobs better, right? Because if you're,

193
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:55,350
if you're like not happy at home
and you're trying to make ends meet,

194
00:10:55,351 --> 00:11:00,000
you're not going to be able to care
for people very well. And so, um,

195
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,990
one of the things that we heard over and
over again from care pros was that they,

196
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:04,891
you know,

197
00:11:04,891 --> 00:11:09,891
they might get a 25 cents increase in
their hourly wage after staying with an

198
00:11:10,681 --> 00:11:15,270
agency for like three years.
Um, there's no performance,

199
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:19,360
like based, uh, reward. There's no way
to know that who's a good care of her,

200
00:11:19,361 --> 00:11:20,340
who's a bad care pro.

201
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,840
And so one of the things that we thought
would be really cool and that they,

202
00:11:23,841 --> 00:11:28,841
they sort of were asking for was some
way to develop your career as a care

203
00:11:28,861 --> 00:11:30,750
professional is a caregiver.
Um,

204
00:11:30,751 --> 00:11:33,930
and so the only way you can really do
that though is to give them signals as to

205
00:11:33,931 --> 00:11:36,990
what they're doing really well and what
they're doing not so well what they can

206
00:11:36,991 --> 00:11:40,320
improve on. And then you can train.
And so one of the he reasons we did,

207
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,620
we started to make the switch to an
employee model was that with employees you

208
00:11:43,621 --> 00:11:48,300
can actually train and develop and like
really invest in them as people and like

209
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,510
as workers.
Um,

210
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:53,290
and so that was one of the primary
reasons we decided to make that change.

211
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,460
And they're still employed today.
So,

212
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,580
so then you mentioned the
valley took care givers.

213
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:03,590
If we look at this in comparison to
traditional senior care centers or senior

214
00:12:04,351 --> 00:12:08,550
care models, what value do you
add to the other key players?

215
00:12:08,551 --> 00:12:10,290
So then in this case,
the,

216
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:14,850
maybe the seniors themselves or also
maybe the family members who are,

217
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,070
uh,
buying the care for their senior?

218
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:22,780
Yeah, so, um, the current
industry is very fragmented. So,

219
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,870
uh, if you think about anything like
over the con and the nationwide,

220
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:28,290
there's something like 40
to 50,000 agencies. Um,

221
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:31,060
it's not because like no one's ever
tried to make up a large agency.

222
00:12:31,061 --> 00:12:32,580
It's just really hard.
Um,

223
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:36,400
you have a bunch of
people on the demand side,

224
00:12:36,401 --> 00:12:39,070
so all of your seniors needing
care and like, you know,

225
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:42,520
they'll say your grandmother
might have a bad hip and you know,

226
00:12:42,521 --> 00:12:46,390
this chronic medical condition and
she's allergic to dogs and she requires

227
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,880
someone who can lift someone
out of bed every morning.

228
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:54,180
Or my mother or grandmother might meed
to speak Mandarin and she's allergic to

229
00:12:54,461 --> 00:12:57,610
cats and she, you know,
has three sets of stairs.

230
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,260
So you need somebody who will
lift her downstairs said.

231
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,470
So the requirements for people
are Super Heterogeneous.

232
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,280
And then on the demands
on the supply side,

233
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,290
like care pros are also
very heterogeneous.

234
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,300
Like this person that might
be able to lift 200 pounds,

235
00:13:10,301 --> 00:13:12,760
but this were some may not
this person pieces language.

236
00:13:12,761 --> 00:13:16,450
This person can only drive five miles
outside of her home because she has two

237
00:13:16,451 --> 00:13:18,620
kids that she needs to pick up after work.
Um,

238
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,740
and so there are all these sort
of stipulations on both sides.

239
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:25,990
And so doing a match is actually
really difficult. And so, uh,

240
00:13:25,991 --> 00:13:29,620
if you are a small mom and pop
agency, which a lot of these, these,

241
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,950
these places are, you don't have
the logistical, operational,

242
00:13:32,951 --> 00:13:37,150
sort of like technology brain to do that
because you're trying to do it on your

243
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,960
head.

244
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,990
So you might have a staff of a few people
trying to like match all these things.

245
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,550
And so, um, a lot of
it is also very analog.

246
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:49,210
So I care pros, we'll literally have to
take a telephone in the morning and said,

247
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:51,200
okay, what am I going to go? Um, they'll,

248
00:13:51,201 --> 00:13:56,201
they'll literally take their notes per
visit on like a spiral bound notebook

249
00:13:56,231 --> 00:14:00,410
with the tensile and they'll leave
it on the desk. Um, and so, uh,

250
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:03,340
we also talked to folks who, you know,
who run agencies with the little,

251
00:14:03,341 --> 00:14:07,000
they drive around to all their clients,
pick up those notebooks, you know,

252
00:14:07,001 --> 00:14:09,970
transcribe some of those notes into
their own system and then return all the

253
00:14:09,971 --> 00:14:13,780
notebooks back. Um, so
it's, it's just very manual.

254
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:17,350
And so one of the things that we hope to
bring in the hand have been bringing is

255
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:20,080
a more technology bent on this
world, those, that rote work.

256
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:23,200
And so one of the key learnings
for us was that like, you know,

257
00:14:23,201 --> 00:14:26,320
you could try to automate everything, but
we're not going to send robots do care.

258
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,190
Like that's just not gonna work.
Um,

259
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:32,010
and so what we can do is those have
computers do as much as the sort of main,

260
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:37,060
like the, uh, the rote tasks,
the, um, matching algorithms,

261
00:14:37,061 --> 00:14:41,140
the gps tracking stuff. And then
let the humans do that. Really,

262
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:43,690
really human stuff. And so we
can get there about, you know,

263
00:14:43,691 --> 00:14:45,880
call 80% and then let
the humans do the rest.

264
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:48,520
And so one of the things that we've been
trying to do is actually just give more

265
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:52,490
transparency to the process, right?
So if like I live in California,

266
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:55,760
but my parents are in the east coast and
I have someone I caregiver going every

267
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:57,080
day,
um,

268
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:00,110
I can't go and find that spiral bound
notebook and have someone read that to me

269
00:15:00,111 --> 00:15:04,250
every day. So we have given
an APP, so they care pro,
we've given an to the family,

270
00:15:04,251 --> 00:15:07,220
they can see notes right away,
they can call on any time.

271
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:09,830
I'm scheduling's a lot easier,
um,

272
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:15,350
the technology we use to then be able
to track and give you progress notes on

273
00:15:15,351 --> 00:15:17,600
sort of how the visit is
going his way. But, you know,

274
00:15:17,601 --> 00:15:21,350
sort of amazing in this
industry for a lot of folks. Um,

275
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:26,380
and so just trying to up the quality
and transparency of care itself,

276
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,240
um, has been a huge goal for us. Um,

277
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:32,210
and definitely the ability
to use technology to scale.

278
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,990
So because we have all this
technology we might have,

279
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:39,680
we might require one human to do this
instead of 10. And so when you have that,

280
00:15:39,681 --> 00:15:41,440
you can save a lot of those,
um,

281
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:45,890
that time to go do other interesting
innovative features to help with care

282
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:50,740
delivery. So definitely a technology
is definitely used to scale to pin,

283
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,650
make better,
better care,

284
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:54,410
better quality of at the same time we
have to recognize that it can't replace

285
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:58,460
humans. And so at the end of the day,
the human human experience is still the,

286
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:03,110
the end product. You mentioned that
you provide training for your care pro.

287
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:07,310
So what does that training
and compass, it can vary, um,

288
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:12,260
to sort of like basic skillsets. Like
how do you lift and transfer, uh, uh,

289
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:16,910
someone who has a, um, who's bedridden
out of bed of bed into a chair.

290
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:21,470
Um, how do you take someone
from their bed to a toilet? Um,

291
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,960
there are things like, okay, uh,

292
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,780
what is the best way to,
um,

293
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,360
assist someone in this particular task?
Um, and so we can also do things like, Oh,

294
00:16:32,361 --> 00:16:34,930
if you, if this person
has Parkinson's, um,

295
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,140
these are specific tools and techniques
that you can use to help maneuver them

296
00:16:39,141 --> 00:16:43,730
physically. Um, if someone has dementia
here, things here, techniques and sort of,

297
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:48,770
um, generally accepted ways
to communicate or to, uh,

298
00:16:48,771 --> 00:16:51,620
elicit, uh, feedback
from, from those folks.

299
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:56,060
And so a lot of it is sort of
a skill wise, but also, um,

300
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,640
how do you basically interact
with different types of people?

301
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,980
Because a lot of our, our, uh, clients,
uh, their conditions vary greatly. So,

302
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,740
uh, it's not like one,
one bucket fits all.

303
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,680
And in terms of the
composition of your audience,

304
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,120
are you looking at mainly people who
are soliciting care for their family

305
00:17:14,121 --> 00:17:17,750
members or actually seniors themselves
who are asking for services for

306
00:17:17,751 --> 00:17:19,310
themselves? Yeah, it's both.

307
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,250
We thought in the very beginning that
we'd have more of what we call adult

308
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:26,600
children. So it sort of someone, a child
or a nephew or a sort of family member,

309
00:17:26,601 --> 00:17:29,480
then you're responsible for
someone who's older. Um,

310
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,580
but we also have folks who
just want care for themselves.

311
00:17:31,581 --> 00:17:33,890
They recognize that they would want,
well they want to stay at home,

312
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,600
they don't want to go
nursing home or facility.

313
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,830
And so having a little bit additional help
is actually really useful. Um, so yeah,

314
00:17:39,831 --> 00:17:41,060
it really,
it just really varies,

315
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:44,810
but we definitely have more folks who
are getting care for themselves than we

316
00:17:44,811 --> 00:17:45,644
originally thought.

317
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:50,010
So that again goes to debunk that myth
that seniors don't really engage with

318
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:53,100
technology. Right. Cause I need to have
some understanding in order to reach you.

319
00:17:53,101 --> 00:17:53,934
In some ways.

320
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:55,920
Yeah,
they do have to sort of find us.

321
00:17:55,921 --> 00:17:59,460
But at the same time we don't
require any technology to use honor.

322
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,590
But that was a very conscious point.

323
00:18:01,591 --> 00:18:04,950
So like if you don't want to touch a
computer, you don't want to use an APP,

324
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,360
you don't have to. Oh you
can. Like you can most of our
customers call us. Oh, okay.

325
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,313
Yeah.

326
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:15,950
So then you're also seeing how maybe you
can leverage old technology using new

327
00:18:17,131 --> 00:18:20,130
technology for the platform,
but for the interface relying on them.

328
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,420
Yeah. And so like those
trends will change as well.

329
00:18:22,421 --> 00:18:25,050
So like our current demographic,
a lot of folks just want to call it.

330
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,280
And also you think about if you're,
you know,

331
00:18:27,281 --> 00:18:30,820
an adult child and let's say your
mom falls, which is very common, uh,

332
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,910
entryway into home care. Um, you cove,

333
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:38,020
you go from knowing nothing about home
care to someone saying your mom needs

334
00:18:38,021 --> 00:18:40,420
like eight hours of care a day
and you're like, oh my God. Like,

335
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,190
what the Hell is home care?
Um,

336
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,620
and so you need to figure out like
what's going on in your remote in a very

337
00:18:44,621 --> 00:18:47,590
emotional state.
And so when you're a very emotional state,

338
00:18:47,591 --> 00:18:49,240
you're not going to like pick up
your iPhone and be like, okay,

339
00:18:49,241 --> 00:18:52,240
I want care and click, click, click like
you're gonna want to call somebody. Um,

340
00:18:52,241 --> 00:18:55,330
and so we have a dedicated team of people
who answer those calls to make sure

341
00:18:55,331 --> 00:18:59,530
that people can walk the people through
that process. Um, and same time though,

342
00:18:59,531 --> 00:19:01,300
if you, you know, have
gotten care for a while,

343
00:19:01,301 --> 00:19:03,560
you kind of know what home care is and
all you want to do is sort of pressing

344
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,850
buttons, you can do that as well.
So there are different options. Um,

345
00:19:06,851 --> 00:19:08,140
and that'll probably change like,
you know,

346
00:19:08,141 --> 00:19:11,440
I think when our one of our goals is to
make honor, take care of us, what world,

347
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,900
so, uh, obviously when we're older,

348
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:17,320
the times maybe that no one wants to call
it every once you use an iPhone or an

349
00:19:17,321 --> 00:19:19,030
android phone or whatever.
Um,

350
00:19:19,031 --> 00:19:24,010
so we can kind of see the trends
coming into the industry, um, which is,

351
00:19:24,011 --> 00:19:24,430
uh,

352
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:29,110
a nice side effect of not working in
some sort of more younger social media

353
00:19:29,111 --> 00:19:31,930
stuff because I don't know what the
next 17 year old wants on her phone,

354
00:19:31,931 --> 00:19:34,900
but I do kind of know what the
next 50 year old once. So, uh,

355
00:19:34,901 --> 00:19:36,610
that's been kind of an interesting change

356
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,630
in terms of scaling.
So I see this in home,

357
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:44,830
elderly care as being
something that requires a lot
of trust built over time and

358
00:19:44,831 --> 00:19:48,250
something that people really have to
open themselves up to and be comfortable

359
00:19:48,251 --> 00:19:50,590
with. So how, as you're scaling,

360
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,160
do you maintain that sense
of trust and comfort?

361
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:58,460
Yeah. Um, I think the biggest thing you
can do is also always frame your frame,

362
00:19:58,461 --> 00:19:59,990
your product.
And your team in the right way.

363
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:02,870
So when I said we don't think
of ourselves as a tech company,

364
00:20:02,871 --> 00:20:05,930
but we think of ourselves as a
services company, like that's the core,

365
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:10,280
like that's the mission. Um,
and so trust is huge because,

366
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:13,340
um, unlike, I think a lot
of people are like, oh,

367
00:20:13,341 --> 00:20:16,010
why don't you just do childcare to
unlike childcare where there's usually a

368
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,290
handoff where you're physically present,

369
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,410
you give your child to a babysitter or
nanny, and then at the end of the day,

370
00:20:21,411 --> 00:20:23,220
the nanny returns a child to you.
Um,

371
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,790
that doesn't always happen with senior
care because you generally don't live

372
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:29,150
with your parents at this age where
you're across country or you're not,

373
00:20:29,151 --> 00:20:33,230
not in the same area. And
so the trust part, um,

374
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:37,340
you have to, uh, it's kind
of both human and tech.

375
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,440
So on the human side you have
to have a great care pro.

376
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,530
Like if the person coming to your home
is terrible, like obviously the trust is,

377
00:20:42,531 --> 00:20:46,790
goes down the toilet. So being really
good hiring, um, really good care,

378
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,660
you know,
having the right kind of vetting process,

379
00:20:49,661 --> 00:20:52,030
the right kind of training
process and interview process. Um,

380
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,130
the other part is just sort of
supplementing that with technology.

381
00:20:54,131 --> 00:20:56,890
So we have gps turned
on for our here post.

382
00:20:56,891 --> 00:20:59,860
When they use the apps we can tell
what they're there. Right. Um,

383
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:02,690
that's also to protect the care pro
cause we do have a lot of, some, some uh,

384
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,480
instances where the client's like,
oh no,

385
00:21:04,481 --> 00:21:08,140
the care pro never showed up because
they didn't want to expose something to a

386
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:12,410
family member. But they were like, well
no, they were there. Um, and so it's a,

387
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:16,750
it's a dual sided thing where you can't,
if you just come with tech,

388
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:20,770
it's too robotic, it's too cold.
Um, the baby just come with humans.

389
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:23,840
There are a lot of, you know, sort of, uh,

390
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:28,900
non verifiable anecdotal things that
were inefficiencies or deficiencies or he

391
00:21:28,901 --> 00:21:32,170
said she said things and so you can kind
of couple those together and then have

392
00:21:32,171 --> 00:21:35,890
a better package to then improve
on that or that trust. My truck

393
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:40,580
also related to scaling. So I saw that
you guys are available in California,

394
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,770
New Mexico and Texas right now.

395
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:47,720
How did you pick which cities to go into
first and then how do you think about a

396
00:21:47,721 --> 00:21:48,700
new city that you want?
Yeah,

397
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:53,880
yeah. So, um, a fear of ours was
actually just going too fast.

398
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:57,360
Like you hear all these stories about
other companies who have like really

399
00:21:57,361 --> 00:22:00,180
expanded and they had to retract
and we don't want to do that. Uh,

400
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,490
just because if you retract your service,
this is,

401
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:05,460
this is the thing that's like life
critical for a lot of people. Um,

402
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:10,350
and so every new market that we did,
uh, currently was an experiment. So, um,

403
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:15,370
La was a, you know, like an hour flight
away. So can we do, can we do that? Um,

404
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:19,170
Dallas, I mean, Texas was okay, it's
a couple hour flight away. Like,

405
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:23,190
can we do that a different time zone? Um,
you know, for all the engineers are like,

406
00:22:23,191 --> 00:22:27,630
oh, time zone, that's sucks. So we had to
kind of like figured out how to do that.

407
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:32,360
Um, and then Albuquerque was
a smaller area, like a less
sort of dense urban read,

408
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:37,110
uh, urban regions. So we're like, okay,
can we handle that? Um, and so, uh,

409
00:22:37,111 --> 00:22:41,610
we definitely wanted to learn and we can
be, the best way to learn is by doing.

410
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:46,080
And so we really carefully figured out
what markets would give us the best

411
00:22:46,081 --> 00:22:50,280
learnings to then be able to take
our model and scale out. So yes,

412
00:22:50,281 --> 00:22:52,760
eventually we'd love to be nationwide.
Um,

413
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,900
in terms of like the next
market we'll go to again,

414
00:22:54,901 --> 00:22:57,570
we'll probably be a combination of,
you know, are there good partnerships,

415
00:22:57,571 --> 00:22:59,610
what's the demographic look like?
Services level,

416
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,210
what can we learn from that
particular market? Um, you
know, things like that. So,

417
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,533
yeah.

418
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:09,140
And you were at Google for about a
year in 2012 maybe you could tell us if

419
00:23:09,141 --> 00:23:13,250
there's anything that you learned while
at Google that has helped you with on it.

420
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:18,890
Um, I learned, I didn't want to
be a Google, but, um, I did, uh,

421
00:23:18,891 --> 00:23:21,200
it was really interesting
because I think from the outside,

422
00:23:21,201 --> 00:23:25,580
Google is this like big, amazing,
monolithic collect technology company. Um,

423
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:29,450
and so it was very interesting for me
personally to learn how that worked.

424
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,740
Like when you come in, it's like, okay,

425
00:23:30,741 --> 00:23:33,950
well how do they form the organization
is how do they make product?

426
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:38,540
How to make decisions. Um, you know,
what are the roles that they hire for,

427
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:39,860
how do they hire?
And so for me,

428
00:23:39,861 --> 00:23:42,520
that was really enlightening
because it gave me a, um,

429
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:47,420
a different perspective on like how I
did my, how I did my team building. Um,

430
00:23:47,421 --> 00:23:50,300
and so, uh, just being
here like learning, okay,

431
00:23:50,301 --> 00:23:54,830
well this team operates this way and
they set goals this way or they hire this

432
00:23:54,831 --> 00:23:59,660
way or they structure this team this
way in order to, to create these, um,

433
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:03,300
these incentives to get this goal done.
Um,

434
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:07,190
that was really useful so that then I
can incorporate that into honor and think

435
00:24:07,191 --> 00:24:09,940
about, okay, well, when I'm building
the team, now how do I want it?

436
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,230
How do I want to do it? Right? I
can, I've learned this from Meebo,

437
00:24:12,231 --> 00:24:15,140
I learned this from Google and how can,
how can I combine this the right way?

438
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,410
And throughout these first few years,

439
00:24:18,411 --> 00:24:23,360
what do you see as something that your
team has done really well at honor?

440
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:28,790
Um, we execute a lot and
crank out a lot of stuff.

441
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:32,720
Um, I think one of the things
that we did really well was, um,

442
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,860
not rush the build.
Um,

443
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:40,820
and also having the realization that
we needed to be completely open minded

444
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:43,510
because none of us are from health care.
Um,

445
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:47,720
and so because the team stayed small
and Nimble and we were very sort of

446
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:50,600
focused,
I think focus for startups is key.

447
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:54,650
Like most startups die from
suicide and homicide. Um,

448
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:58,650
and so for us we just had to stay laser
focused. Okay. What are we building? Um,

449
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,780
and because the team,

450
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,780
some of us have worked together before
and we were very picky about hiring,

451
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,600
having really high
bandwidth communication, um,

452
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,260
really excels your timeline to be
able to build something. So, you know,

453
00:25:09,261 --> 00:25:13,730
most home care agencies
tap out at a certain scale,

454
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,990
which is why the industry is very
fragmented. Um, and so within,

455
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:19,970
call it three years of our inception,

456
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:23,660
we are probably one of the largest
home care entities in the barrier,

457
00:25:23,661 --> 00:25:25,160
maybe the largest.
Um,

458
00:25:25,161 --> 00:25:27,380
it took us three years to get
there when it usually takes 15.

459
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:30,740
So it kind of speaks to
combination of like good teamwork,

460
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:35,210
like the right technology, you know,
sort of cutting edge stuff. Um,

461
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,400
and then really understanding
how to learn from things.

462
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,210
I think one of the downsides of the
industry is that there are so many well

463
00:25:41,211 --> 00:25:45,020
intentioned people but they don't have
the means and the technology to learn and

464
00:25:45,021 --> 00:25:49,880
iterate. And so getting data is really
hard for them. Everything's, you know,

465
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,250
in spiral bound notebooks
and things like that. Um,

466
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,720
and for us we can get a lot of data.

467
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:58,160
Like we have so much data about how care
works, how do you do matching, you know,

468
00:25:58,161 --> 00:25:59,030
what are the trends?

469
00:25:59,031 --> 00:26:03,500
Like what are we seeing in terms of shift
lengths and days and areas and markets

470
00:26:03,501 --> 00:26:05,330
and pricing and waging what wages.

471
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:08,990
And so all of that you can kind of
use to learn and improve the service.

472
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:12,650
When I think the current industry
has a hard time accessing that. So,

473
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:16,880
and as you were deciding whether to
jump back into doing a startup or not,

474
00:26:16,881 --> 00:26:20,000
what were some factors that
you were considering? Um,

475
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:22,790
that is just always very personal.
Um,

476
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:27,680
so obviously I was at the
age where I wanted to have
kids. Um, and so I was like,

477
00:26:27,681 --> 00:26:31,520
well if you really nice just to state
Google cause they have like really good

478
00:26:31,521 --> 00:26:36,470
maternity leave and it's like really
comfortable. Um, and you know,

479
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:40,490
like I can have like a very routine
schedule. Um, at the same time though,

480
00:26:40,491 --> 00:26:44,670
I think I had it had that,
that need to, to do more. Um,

481
00:26:44,671 --> 00:26:47,280
I think Meebo he wouldn't, maybe it
was great. I mean I had a great time,

482
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:52,320
but it didn't have the impact that I
think when we got older we really wanted,

483
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,730
um, and uh, startups, average lifespan.

484
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,720
And I say this law is about seven years
to some sort of event or sort of pivot.

485
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:04,820
Um, and so I was like, wow, I do, I really
want to dedicate another seven years, um,

486
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:08,670
and have kids while I do that.
And you know, all that stuff. Um,

487
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:14,150
and so the allure of working
with my cofounders again,

488
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:19,420
um, it was just really good timing in
terms of like the senior space. Um,

489
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:22,170
no one had really made a big play
in it before and we were like,

490
00:27:22,171 --> 00:27:24,120
we can really solve this. Um, I,

491
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,280
I use this analogy a lot in
my cofounder does as well,

492
00:27:26,281 --> 00:27:30,090
but a lot of problems that entrepreneurs
run into that are big if you think

493
00:27:30,091 --> 00:27:33,330
about it like an onion is that you
peel back one layer, you're like, oh,

494
00:27:33,331 --> 00:27:36,060
I can solve that. If people are going
to delay your, like I could solve that.

495
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,060
And then at some point you keep peeling,
we hit this hardcore and you're like,

496
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,240
crap,
like I can't solve that.

497
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:45,980
It's like a regulation or it would take
like 10 years to build or I need to get

498
00:27:45,981 --> 00:27:50,040
like government approval and now it takes
like six years or whatever. Um, but in,

499
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:51,930
in sort of the home care space,
we kept peeling.

500
00:27:51,931 --> 00:27:54,300
We couldn't find anything that was
super hard because we're like, oh,

501
00:27:54,301 --> 00:27:55,740
we could sell that because I
thought we could sell that.

502
00:27:55,741 --> 00:27:59,190
And that was just really exciting. Um,
and so jumping back in, we're like,

503
00:27:59,191 --> 00:28:00,540
all right,
let's just,

504
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:03,900
let's just do this because you
basically have to commit 100% or zero,

505
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:08,760
like you can't have half to do it. Um, and
so, uh, we all kind of said, all right,

506
00:28:08,761 --> 00:28:13,440
let's just buckle up and do it. Um,
have kids with all along the way. Um,

507
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,100
and so,
uh,

508
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:18,600
this decision to do it was like actually
quite easy one when we can just talk

509
00:28:18,601 --> 00:28:22,650
about that way. Um, and so far I've
seen no have no regrets. So, oh yeah,

510
00:28:22,651 --> 00:28:26,230
that was comprehensive answer,
I think

511
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:31,390
time to open it up for the
audience. Questions. Hi Sandy. Um,

512
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:35,720
I have a question about, um, I think
what you're doing is fantastic.

513
00:28:35,721 --> 00:28:39,200
I think you have a great product and
everything you're doing for the senior

514
00:28:39,201 --> 00:28:40,034
community.
Um,

515
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:43,910
a couple of years ago I went
to the National Association
for the Deaf Conference.

516
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:47,030
It was in Atlanta and they also
had one in Phoenix as well.

517
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:51,220
And I met a lot of members from the
deaf community who are aging, um,

518
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:54,710
specific groups of seniors,
helping people find a place to go.

519
00:28:54,711 --> 00:28:58,090
Do you have any involvement
with the deaf community, uh,

520
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,220
with your product or your services?
Um,

521
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,900
something that would be
accessible for the deaf community?

522
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,260
So specifically,
um,

523
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,800
we don't have anything specifically
targeted towards the death,

524
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,400
but like I said before,
our audience and the client demographic,

525
00:29:11,401 --> 00:29:15,750
it's very heterogeneous. We have people
with all sorts of conditions. Um,

526
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:20,220
and so we don't say, okay, just because
you have this condition or that condition,

527
00:29:20,221 --> 00:29:24,360
we can't serve you. It's really dependent
on the kind of care the person needs.

528
00:29:24,361 --> 00:29:29,250
And so let's say someone is deaf,
they have a bad hip, uh, they require,

529
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:31,260
uh,
more lifting and transferring out of bed,

530
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:34,410
then we would just try to find the right
caregiver to then surface that person.

531
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,780
So,
um,

532
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:40,360
we do have partnerships with
more disease specific, um,

533
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:44,680
uh, organization. So the pocket knife,
National Parkinson's foundation, um,

534
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:47,890
and uh, national, the, um, um,

535
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:51,130
cancer organizations.
But, uh, in the future,

536
00:29:51,131 --> 00:29:54,160
obviously we'd hope to partner with
more people. But again, like we don't,

537
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:57,730
there's no like specifically
targeted service for death,

538
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,550
but death to cause your death doesn't
mean you can't help them care. So.

539
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:05,030
Okay. Here's a question from
the dory. Uh, besides honor,

540
00:30:05,031 --> 00:30:08,690
what our key technological improvements
that you believe have improved elderly

541
00:30:08,691 --> 00:30:12,740
care? What other technological
improvements would you
like to see in the space to

542
00:30:12,741 --> 00:30:15,980
improve the experience for both
the caretaker and the elderly?

543
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:21,110
Yeah, I think the biggest thing
is probably just access. Um,

544
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,020
there are a lot of devices and market,
a lot of technologies that are, uh,

545
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:27,850
like I said, really like
specifically targeted for seniors,

546
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:32,830
but they're taking a very,
um, non granular stance.

547
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:36,640
So like I said, the bigger buttons,
the big fonts and the senior, like,

548
00:30:36,641 --> 00:30:38,200
have you talked to a lot of older adults?

549
00:30:38,201 --> 00:30:40,540
They don't like things dumbed down
for them. Like they're like, I'm,

550
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:44,110
I'm perfectly capable of
using it regular device. Um,

551
00:30:44,111 --> 00:30:47,890
so I think there needs to
be a change in the attitude,

552
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:50,920
I think more than the actual devices.
Um,

553
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:54,640
because if you sort of rethink
the way you frame technology,

554
00:30:54,641 --> 00:30:58,390
you can like I know plenty of seniors
who use iPhones and android phones and a

555
00:30:58,391 --> 00:31:02,340
very expert manner. Um, and there
are some folks who don't. Um,

556
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,230
and so there I think the,

557
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:08,500
if you change the way
that you target seniors,

558
00:31:08,501 --> 00:31:10,660
I think that would be a big difference.
Um,

559
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:14,260
things that I think it had been
really helpful for folks are, um,

560
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:17,950
you know, more, um,

561
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
more educational tools for folks who
help seniors is probably a good step.

562
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:29,710
So the fact that we have an APP for care
pros is actually like a novel thing for

563
00:31:29,711 --> 00:31:30,890
the industry.
Um,

564
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:35,770
but it makes them better enabled to
help people who require help. Um,

565
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:40,780
I would say the, um, one
thing that is a, a lot of the,

566
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:45,640
um, the physical access things
that you and I take for granted,

567
00:31:45,641 --> 00:31:49,450
like walking upstairs, going
through her door, Romania, lot code,

568
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,890
those kinds of things could probably
be improved as the senior population

569
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,910
increased it, uh, it gets larger.
Um, so basically I think that my,

570
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:59,140
my biggest thing is not specifics,

571
00:31:59,141 --> 00:32:03,460
but more of the attitude change I think
is probably more important than the

572
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:05,650
actual,
like physical things are being built.

573
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:07,081
And related to that,

574
00:32:07,081 --> 00:32:11,400
have you thought about maybe expanding
your sphere of care into sort of

575
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:16,200
providing support services for the family
members who are maybe like learning

576
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:17,770
about working or,
uh,

577
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:22,940
supporting their family members who are
becoming elderly and maybe developing

578
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,840
additional needs that
they didn't have before?

579
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:27,050
Yeah, so home care, generally speaking,

580
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:31,190
people don't think about it
until they really need it.

581
00:32:31,191 --> 00:32:33,470
So it don't care is usually
triggered by an acute event,

582
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:38,420
usually a fall or a met like a, um,
a surgery or something medical. Um,

583
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,250
if we had the a lot earlier,

584
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:44,270
we could actually then introduce
care and a more lightweight manner.

585
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:48,650
So then that way the transition
into home care is less jarring.

586
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,810
Um,
in terms of family members,

587
00:32:50,811 --> 00:32:55,340
we do have a lot of family members who
get home care for their spouses or their

588
00:32:55,341 --> 00:32:57,050
parents, um, as respite care.

589
00:32:57,051 --> 00:32:59,260
So they are the primary
caretaker and they live with the,

590
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:02,000
with with the person
Riverton, uh, receiving care.

591
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:06,330
But they might need a day off or they
might need three days off every week cause

592
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:10,280
it's kind of a full time job.
And so the sub supplement with with honor,

593
00:33:10,281 --> 00:33:14,510
we're home care to help with that.
Um, and I think the other, um,

594
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:18,050
part of it is that, uh, a lot of people
who are in this situation feel very alone.

595
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:21,860
Um, there aren't like social
networks for people who are giving,

596
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:25,250
who are receiving home care for their
family members and no one talks about this

597
00:33:25,251 --> 00:33:27,200
like on Facebook or whatever.
Right? It's not like you're saying,

598
00:33:27,201 --> 00:33:30,720
oh my mom got here today. Like
no one talks about it. So, uh,

599
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,840
opening up the conversation,
having more community around that.

600
00:33:32,841 --> 00:33:37,040
It's one of our goals as well. Um,
and also just the transparency.

601
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:40,790
It's like having the peace of mind
to get home care. Cause it's scary.

602
00:33:40,791 --> 00:33:42,740
It's like you're letting a stranger
into your home and take care of your,

603
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:46,520
your mom or dad doing very intimate things
like going to the bathroom or getting

604
00:33:46,521 --> 00:33:48,050
out of bed.
Um,

605
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,860
and so the support network I
think needs to be there. Um,

606
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,690
cause almost everybody we talked to,
um,

607
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:59,060
has a personal story but they don't
never share it because it's just,

608
00:33:59,061 --> 00:34:00,530
it's come up.
It's a very taboo subject.

609
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:05,560
So I'm hoping it opening to hoping to
open up that that dialogue is one of the

610
00:34:07,071 --> 00:34:07,791
things that we're trying to do,

611
00:34:07,791 --> 00:34:12,540
which is why I think we we frame honor
and a very positive light. A lot of um,

612
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:17,780
agencies were senior related products
on TV you see or like the help I've

613
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:21,110
fallen, I can't get up or it's
like very like fear based. Um,

614
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:25,390
we chose amber as a very bright
color, very positive color. Um,

615
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:28,190
we talked about it a very positive manner.
We have positive images,

616
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:33,710
not images that sort of
instill fear or um, you know,

617
00:34:33,711 --> 00:34:35,900
sort of the,
the more scary side of that.

618
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:40,530
How do you reach new clients and convey
valleys of trust and safety in non tech

619
00:34:40,531 --> 00:34:44,370
cities where people have not heard of
honor and may rely on word of mouth or

620
00:34:44,371 --> 00:34:45,210
local searches?

621
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,550
Yeah. So healthcare
traditionally is a very local,

622
00:34:47,551 --> 00:34:50,850
so word of mouth is extremely
powerful. Um, and you can't just,

623
00:34:50,851 --> 00:34:54,490
when home care market share
by like advertising on,

624
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:57,490
on Google or Facebook because
that's not how you reach people. Um,

625
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,051
and like I said,

626
00:34:58,051 --> 00:35:03,051
a lot of times home care is triggered by
an acute event and so you're not paying

627
00:35:03,121 --> 00:35:05,940
attention anything in home care or in
the elderly space where the health care

628
00:35:05,941 --> 00:35:08,140
space until something
happens. And then, you know,

629
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:11,160
our job is to be there when that happens.

630
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:15,540
So I'm addressing the part where someone
who's not very tech savvy or they don't

631
00:35:15,541 --> 00:35:17,400
really know much about honor.
Um,

632
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:22,200
the one thing that we have to
portray is that we are human. And so,

633
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:26,160
um, prior to any home
care, um, set of visits,

634
00:35:26,161 --> 00:35:30,060
we send a fee like a person I cared one
of our care advisors to your home to do

635
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,080
a consultation.

636
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,540
Like they talk you through the plan and
they talk you through what your needs

637
00:35:33,541 --> 00:35:37,890
are. They listen to what you need. Cause
a lot of times just don't, don't know.

638
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,900
It's like, okay, my mom
fell. What do I do? Okay,

639
00:35:39,901 --> 00:35:43,320
you need someone to actually like walk
you through that process. And so, um,

640
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:48,030
basically instilling trust via a person
is still a great way to do it. Um,

641
00:35:48,031 --> 00:35:50,490
and so that's something that
we do definitely employ. Um,

642
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,970
and then also just being a
knowledge expert. So again,

643
00:35:53,971 --> 00:35:56,460
when you're like emotional and you're
scared and you don't know what you're

644
00:35:56,461 --> 00:35:59,850
doing, you want someone to tell you
it's okay. I've done this before,

645
00:35:59,851 --> 00:36:02,040
I've seen this before.
Like, let me listen to you,

646
00:36:02,041 --> 00:36:06,350
I can help you through this process.
Um, and so that's a very, very, um,

647
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:10,710
serious thing that we take very seriously
to make sure that when people come

648
00:36:10,711 --> 00:36:13,040
into honor, when people
think about home care, um,

649
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:17,980
they think about honor and as a
very calming expert voice, um,

650
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:20,550
it's something we strive,
we strive to sort of propagate.

651
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:25,470
You mentioned that a lot of the seniors
that solicit care for themselves reach

652
00:36:25,471 --> 00:36:28,590
out to you via phone.
So how do they find you?

653
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:33,030
Do you also advertise then in traditional
media as well? The yellow pages,

654
00:36:33,031 --> 00:36:36,390
all those? Yeah, so it's been a bit of
a challenge to find out where those,

655
00:36:36,391 --> 00:36:40,070
where those things are. Um, the,
a lot of times, um, like I said,

656
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:43,140
weren't math is most powerful. So reaching
the influencers within the community.

657
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,370
So like a local pastor, uh, local, um,

658
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:51,510
senior organization,
um, the, the, um, the,

659
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,940
you know,
discharge nurse at a facility,

660
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,480
it happens near all the community
members. Um, you know, the mayor,

661
00:36:57,481 --> 00:37:01,440
whoever like is sort of an community
influencer. So that's one way to do it.

662
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:06,570
The other way is just basically to
provide care and then have referrals.

663
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:10,440
So if someone has a great experience with
us, they will tell their friends. Um,

664
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:11,910
because generally speaking,
if you were getting care,

665
00:37:11,911 --> 00:37:15,270
you probably know the people were
getting care. Um, and then, you know,

666
00:37:15,271 --> 00:37:18,870
obviously you try to sort of, um,
advertise and sort of the normal channels,

667
00:37:18,871 --> 00:37:20,010
but those are all but less effective.

668
00:37:20,011 --> 00:37:24,690
Just because it can be generally not in
your frame of mind when you need to. Um,

669
00:37:24,691 --> 00:37:29,691
and then the other part is to partner
with other people who deal with seniors.

670
00:37:29,761 --> 00:37:34,750
So we opened up a partner network to work
with existing home care agencies. Um,

671
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,170
we work with, um, system, so
hospitals and facilities, um,

672
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:40,261
nursing facilities,

673
00:37:40,261 --> 00:37:44,060
discharge facilities to help spread the
word so that they know that honors and

674
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:46,080
option. Um, and that, you know,

675
00:37:46,081 --> 00:37:49,680
we're differentiated from the rest of
the other agencies around because we have

676
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:54,240
all these sort of benefits so that even
these traditional organizations are

677
00:37:54,241 --> 00:37:55,140
willing to work with you.

678
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:58,190
They're not scared of that and
somehow you're going to take over.

679
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,830
We're encompass some of what they're doing
and take this this week. Yeah. So, um,

680
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:06,150
it's been interesting with that
particular, um, um, partnership network.

681
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,440
Um,
like I said,

682
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:11,190
a lot of current home healthcare agencies
have a hard time growing cause they're

683
00:38:11,191 --> 00:38:14,690
like, I have do people, it's all in
my head. I don't have technology. I,

684
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,710
it's like really hard for me to,

685
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:20,310
to like wrangle a care pros and higher
care pros and match care pros. Um,

686
00:38:20,311 --> 00:38:23,280
I get calls at 2:00 AM when a care pro
can't make it and I have to go and like

687
00:38:23,281 --> 00:38:25,140
do the care of myself.
Um,

688
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:29,490
and so they have to deal with all that
and they don't tend to grow a lot. So, um,

689
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:32,700
one of our benefits is that we're
really good at the care pro part.

690
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,990
Like a really good recruiting part.

691
00:38:33,991 --> 00:38:36,490
We have technology to help
us do all that stuff and so,

692
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:39,340
and we can take that burden away
from them. They can actually grow.

693
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:42,670
And so it's actually a really good
partnership where we both sort of benefit

694
00:38:42,671 --> 00:38:45,880
from that. Um, and we're both,
if both people often st mission,

695
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:48,880
like we're trying to help people. Um,
but you know, they're good at one part,

696
00:38:48,881 --> 00:38:50,320
we're going another part.
And so if you put it together,

697
00:38:50,321 --> 00:38:51,154
it's actually really good.

698
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:51,581
Yeah.

699
00:38:51,581 --> 00:38:55,730
So I think this is actually really cool
to see because I think so much of like

700
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,850
the newer like service based economy,

701
00:38:57,851 --> 00:39:01,990
like you look at maybe like Uber
or these other startups, um,

702
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:05,380
people see them as supplanting an
existing industry and there's a lot of

703
00:39:05,381 --> 00:39:10,381
pushback and conflict between
the traditional industry
and the new tech company.

704
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:11,021
Um,

705
00:39:11,021 --> 00:39:15,820
whereas here I think it's sort of you're
trying to work together and make it

706
00:39:15,821 --> 00:39:17,730
more of a mutual relationship.

707
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,740
Yeah, definitely. It's, it,

708
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,630
there initially people were a little bit
skeptical that it'll be like, wait, what?

709
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,770
Like here if I'm just like, wait,
what are you guys doing? Um,

710
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:28,990
but when you kind of explain sort
of like, you know, how we work,

711
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:31,690
why are we doing this? Like why are
were mission focus, things like that.

712
00:39:31,691 --> 00:39:34,120
Then they start to be like, oh wow.
Like if I really partner with you,

713
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:37,450
we can really make a better difference,
a bigger difference and help more people.

714
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:41,180
Um, because a lot of these people who come
into the an inch into the industry are

715
00:39:41,181 --> 00:39:43,000
genuinely there just help people.
Like,

716
00:39:43,001 --> 00:39:45,130
they could make more
money doing other things,

717
00:39:45,131 --> 00:39:48,250
but they really like the work because
they get to interact with clients and talk

718
00:39:48,251 --> 00:39:50,800
to people and help them
through these things. Um,

719
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:55,830
and so when they find a willing partner
like honor who has all these skills and

720
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,760
tech can like teams that they don't have,
it's actually a pretty exciting. So,

721
00:40:00,761 --> 00:40:04,640
um, it's a new way to innovate on
an existing model, I think, um,

722
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:07,240
that were like both sides are
pretty excited about it. So,

723
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,630
uh,
another question from the Dory.

724
00:40:09,631 --> 00:40:13,230
What are some key technology or product
decisions that had to be made to ensure

725
00:40:13,231 --> 00:40:18,231
that honor is friendly both to the elderly
users and also to the family members

726
00:40:18,991 --> 00:40:23,670
who are on different panes of technology?

727
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,833
Familiarity.

728
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,700
Yeah. So, uh, like I said before,

729
00:40:26,701 --> 00:40:30,030
we don't require anybody to know anything
about apps or phones or websites to

730
00:40:30,031 --> 00:40:34,540
use honor. So they could
completely do everything by
phone if they want to do. Um,

731
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,860
because we know that's a huge part of our
audience. Uh, at the same time though,

732
00:40:37,861 --> 00:40:41,430
we do want to push the envelope a little
bit and like sort of give folks the

733
00:40:41,431 --> 00:40:44,820
option is using technology to
see the benefits of it. So, um,

734
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:47,760
all the technology is optional for the,

735
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:52,320
the care team of a particular,
um, uh, a care recipient.

736
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:55,830
So if the family member chooses
to use the family hub, they can,

737
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,010
they don't want to,
they don't have to, um,

738
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:02,280
they want to log into the website and see
all their bills and see the care notes

739
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:05,070
sentence. You get emails they can, but if
they don't want to, they don't have to.

740
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:10,320
So we are trying to be very respectful
of the way the current industry works and

741
00:41:10,321 --> 00:41:14,710
how some people just don't want to touch.
It's too complicated to touch tech. Um,

742
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:15,301
same time though,

743
00:41:15,301 --> 00:41:19,180
if there are folks who really want
to like stick take that leap, um,

744
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,610
we're there with them as well.
Um,

745
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:25,990
the one thing we do require our care
pros do is care pros have is the APP. Um,

746
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:29,880
and they actually love it. So we do push
the technology on the workforce, um,

747
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:34,670
but definitely makes them more effective,
more, um, aware of what's going on. Um,

748
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:38,090
better enable them to find more
jobs by more work or more money.

749
00:41:38,091 --> 00:41:40,850
So that's sort of our,
our balance. But yeah,

750
00:41:40,851 --> 00:41:42,140
if you don't know anything about tech,

751
00:41:42,141 --> 00:41:45,710
you can just use a rotary phone and
call us every day if you want to do

752
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:50,730
elderly care by nonfamily members is
common in the u s but in some other

753
00:41:50,731 --> 00:41:54,120
countries like the Ukraine,
it is not culturally accepted,

754
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:55,860
but there is a huge market for it.

755
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:00,570
I wonder your thoughts on how to help
make a service like honor be acceptable in

756
00:42:00,571 --> 00:42:01,404
such a culture.

757
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:04,300
Yeah. Um, we've, we've actually been, uh,

758
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:06,370
people have reached out
to us from different, uh,

759
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:10,090
sort of care organizations from
different countries. I'm wondering,

760
00:42:10,091 --> 00:42:12,730
we're going to expand to their country.
Obviously we'd love to do that one day,

761
00:42:12,731 --> 00:42:14,790
but obviously not right now.
Um,

762
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:19,210
culturally you have to respect
the way that care works.

763
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:24,190
But I think the trend of more and more
people moving to more urban areas,

764
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,240
um, more more people moving out of
their city that they're born in, um,

765
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:33,720
tends to sort of consolidate a lot of
the same types of concerns around senior

766
00:42:34,331 --> 00:42:37,120
care. So, you know, um,

767
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:40,750
if you don't live in the same place as
your parents moving your parents to where

768
00:42:40,751 --> 00:42:43,780
you are, it can be rather expensive,
right? If you live in a more urban area,

769
00:42:43,781 --> 00:42:47,870
it's just real estate. It's
tighter. Houses are smaller, um,

770
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:52,930
transportation harder,
especially in accessibility.
So if someone has, you know,

771
00:42:52,931 --> 00:42:55,630
a 90 year old mother who
can't do stairs very well,

772
00:42:55,631 --> 00:42:57,220
but you live on the sixth
floor of an apartment,

773
00:42:57,221 --> 00:43:01,870
that's a really difficult thing to
have to deal with. And so a lot of the,

774
00:43:01,871 --> 00:43:04,870
even though culturally people
may have different expectations,

775
00:43:04,871 --> 00:43:08,230
I think a lot of the trends are
moving towards the same direction.

776
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:12,970
And so I think in the future we have
to just find that balance of obviously

777
00:43:12,971 --> 00:43:14,560
respecting the current,
the current tradition,

778
00:43:14,561 --> 00:43:17,950
but also pushing folks to understand
the reality of what's happening.

779
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:22,900
Um, and then, you know, kind
of just to see, you know,

780
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,200
maybe all the caregivers in the particular
country are very different from the

781
00:43:26,201 --> 00:43:28,890
ones in the u s maybe they're doing
it, they're, maybe they're not. Um,

782
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:33,690
if we can introduce, introduce, um, a way
of doing things, maybe that, you know,

783
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:37,240
spurs a new kind of trend or
movement, but, um, any of the day,

784
00:43:37,241 --> 00:43:38,890
I think generally speaking,

785
00:43:38,891 --> 00:43:42,730
a lot of countries are kind of
migrating towards the same problems.

786
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:48,620
Words matter in the space that
you're working in right now.

787
00:43:48,621 --> 00:43:52,520
How does your messaging change between
the patient versus the family member or

788
00:43:52,521 --> 00:43:55,400
caregiver to communicate
your value proposition?

789
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:58,700
What has resonated the most and the least?
Who's,

790
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:01,340
who's usually making
the purchase decision?

791
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:03,090
So generally speaking,

792
00:44:03,091 --> 00:44:07,800
it's usually the adult child that's making
the purchase decision. Um, uh, and so,

793
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:10,920
um,
it's an interesting conversation.

794
00:44:10,921 --> 00:44:15,630
So the most effective communicator
is usually the family member to the,

795
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:19,750
um, senior. Um, but sometimes
it's not. So we do have, um,

796
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,320
care Syrians who are resistant to care.
So they like,

797
00:44:22,321 --> 00:44:23,870
they don't want someone in their home,
they don't want to carry it,

798
00:44:23,871 --> 00:44:25,300
that they need it.
Um,

799
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:29,070
and sometimes they would rather talk to
us then their family member because they

800
00:44:29,071 --> 00:44:34,071
don't want to expose some their needs to
the family member because what happens

801
00:44:34,291 --> 00:44:38,670
is it when you expose that
you are exposing a lack of
control and that's really

802
00:44:38,671 --> 00:44:39,504
scary.

803
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:44,510
And so a lot of times we'll have this
like interesting dynamic where they don't

804
00:44:45,121 --> 00:44:48,510
want it like a person person getting care
doesn't want to tell the family member

805
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,350
all that happened.

806
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:51,510
But they're willing to tell the care
pro because you care if I was helping.

807
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:56,460
So again, it's all dependent
on the sort of situation. Um,

808
00:44:56,490 --> 00:45:00,270
for the most part we do do a lot
of communication through the um,

809
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:01,320
family member who's,

810
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,400
who was the one responsible for the
care or the Dillinger relationship. Um,

811
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:08,310
but a lot of times when the Care
Sabine is the actual account owner,

812
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:10,080
then we directly communicate with them.

813
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:13,570
Can you tell us about how
you train your care pros?

814
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,300
Is it in person training or mostly online?

815
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:18,880
So most of it right now is in person.
Um,

816
00:45:18,881 --> 00:45:21,730
it's usually most effective cause a lot
of it's sort of like physical stuff that

817
00:45:21,731 --> 00:45:26,290
we're teaching. Um, we loved, we are
hoping to expand to more online things.

818
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:31,120
But um, for now a lot of it is
physical in the office, on the job.

819
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:33,400
Um, and also through, um,

820
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:36,840
through the APP or like sort of
phone or text communication. We do,

821
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:37,570
we've talked to our care.

822
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:40,750
It was a lot so that they're in constant
communication with us telling us what

823
00:45:40,751 --> 00:45:41,584
they need to do.

824
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:44,470
And then how many families
are you currently helping?

825
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:48,810
So that's not a number we'd generally
expose. Um, but we just, we are,

826
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:52,660
our sort of canned answer to that is
that we serve the entire bay area,

827
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:57,670
La, Dallas, fort worth and Albuquerque
when we start New Mexico, Albuquerque,

828
00:45:57,671 --> 00:46:00,610
New Mexico. So it kind of gives you a
general idea of sort of the market sizes,

829
00:46:00,611 --> 00:46:02,870
but we don't actually suppose
the actual number. So,

830
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:08,400
and then related to the idea of expanding
potentially to areas where it's not

831
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:10,140
culturally,
um,

832
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:14,970
common for non family members
to take care of the elderly.

833
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:20,510
How do you think about not just
expanding into those areas but maybe like

834
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:27,360
creating materials to help people in
those areas who maybe don't necessarily

835
00:46:27,361 --> 00:46:30,810
interface with your business directly,
but maybe you just provide resources?

836
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,320
Yeah, so that was, uh,

837
00:46:32,321 --> 00:46:35,230
that goes back to the point where just
being a knowledge expert is actually

838
00:46:35,231 --> 00:46:39,370
really helpful. And so I'm not just
having an online presence, but you know,

839
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:42,340
going and getting into the communities,
it's actually a really,

840
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:43,180
really positive thing.

841
00:46:43,181 --> 00:46:48,181
So when you go to a senior center
or you go to like a local event,

842
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:53,020
um, you can just be there and then be a
trusted, like they'd be a familiar face.

843
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:54,820
So then when people have
questions, they're like, oh,

844
00:46:54,821 --> 00:46:57,700
you should talk to this person. They kind
of have an, I have a better idea of how,

845
00:46:57,701 --> 00:46:59,980
like, how, you know,
the elderly space works.

846
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:04,020
Then you start to sort of like in
bed yourself better. And so, um,

847
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:08,830
part of the, the um, way to, um,

848
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:11,500
get better word of mouth is just sort
of taking advantage of the fact that

849
00:47:11,501 --> 00:47:14,920
health care and home care is very local.
And so you have to respect that.

850
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:16,870
You can't just be like,
I'm this giant national entity.

851
00:47:16,871 --> 00:47:19,750
I'm just going to go and spread ads
everywhere. Like that doesn't work.

852
00:47:19,751 --> 00:47:21,960
Like you have to really go in and um,

853
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:26,230
participate and talk to
people and actually like be
in the community to really

854
00:47:26,231 --> 00:47:29,050
make a dent. So that's generally
the tack that will probably,

855
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:33,520
so what's the pricing structure look like
in this industry and where do you find

856
00:47:33,521 --> 00:47:37,770
and where does honor place itself?
Yeah, so pricing generally is by um,

857
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:41,860
shift length. So it's like an hourly early
because the care pros get paid hourly.

858
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:42,640
Um,

859
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:47,640
we're kind of like right smack in the
middle with most of the industry in terms

860
00:47:48,521 --> 00:47:53,230
of our pricing. Um, certain areas are a
little harder to serve. So, for example,

861
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:58,100
if you are a care pro making minimum
wage or a little bit above, you know,

862
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:03,040
a $6 bridge toll from the East Bay to
the peninsula is a lot of money for you.

863
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:07,810
And so it's much harder for you to get
from East Bay to let's say Palo Alto and

864
00:48:07,811 --> 00:48:12,050
so in certain harder to reach
areas. So Palo Alto, you know,

865
00:48:12,051 --> 00:48:15,700
as parts of San Francisco prices can be
a little higher because we have to be

866
00:48:15,701 --> 00:48:20,140
able to pay the care pro more. Um, that's
generally more of a common trend with,

867
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:22,750
with uh, home care.
But generally speaking,

868
00:48:22,751 --> 00:48:25,880
we're kind of like very
much market prices. Um,

869
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:30,890
and our hope is that because we can
take a lot of the manual work out of the

870
00:48:31,001 --> 00:48:34,650
process, um, we can, you know, maybe
at some point charge a little less,

871
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:36,490
pay a little more and it'll take that,

872
00:48:36,491 --> 00:48:41,010
those gains because we have a little more
efficiency within our system since we

873
00:48:41,011 --> 00:48:42,180
are using the employee model.

874
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:45,910
Does that mean that care pros have to
work a certain number of hours or certain

875
00:48:45,911 --> 00:48:48,790
shifts during, um, within with W2's? Uh,

876
00:48:48,791 --> 00:48:51,010
you don't have to like
enforce a certain hour.

877
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:55,930
We have some folks who use us who work
with us on more of a part time basis or

878
00:48:56,110 --> 00:48:58,330
they just pick up shifts in the evening
or on the weekends because they have

879
00:48:58,331 --> 00:48:59,380
another job.
Um,

880
00:48:59,381 --> 00:49:02,260
we have other folks who use us as their
primary Gig and so we are their primary

881
00:49:02,261 --> 00:49:05,590
employer and they take most of the work
from us. It's very fuck. Like it's,

882
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:09,000
it's more flexible and I think then people
kind of think about when think about

883
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:10,940
employee model,
but um,

884
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:16,070
like we do realize that care pros have
a lot of restrictions in terms of what

885
00:49:16,361 --> 00:49:20,950
they can and can't do. You know,
folks at Google generally don't have,

886
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:23,860
when you have trouble with your car
it's like, oh, it's really annoying.

887
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:28,690
But when your car is the only thing
that is really providing your work,

888
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:32,650
uh, conduit, um, it's, it's a lot harder.

889
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:36,370
And so we just to make sure that we're
respectful of that and we provide enough

890
00:49:36,371 --> 00:49:40,540
sort of options of types of work for
our care pros. And I'm wrapping up.

891
00:49:40,541 --> 00:49:45,370
I have one question about any specific
technology or product that you're excited

892
00:49:45,371 --> 00:49:47,350
about in the near future?

893
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:51,880
I would say the just for more than one.
Yeah,

894
00:49:51,881 --> 00:49:56,500
I guess I just related to
honor, um, there's much more
intention now to seniors.

895
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,780
I think that's awesome. Um, before honor,

896
00:49:58,781 --> 00:50:03,400
there was like no funding in the
senior space. Um, and now we have,

897
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:06,310
um, you know, companies like really,

898
00:50:06,311 --> 00:50:09,360
really focusing on how
to cater to seniors. Um,

899
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:11,200
and not just like building
devices or technology,

900
00:50:11,201 --> 00:50:14,440
but sort of really thinking about
it from a offerings perspective.

901
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:17,890
Cause just cause the baby boomers and
senior population is just going to explode

902
00:50:17,891 --> 00:50:21,790
in the next 10 years or 10 to two,
10 to 20 years. So I would say like,

903
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:23,860
and then maybe nothing specific,
but anything really,

904
00:50:23,861 --> 00:50:28,820
like anybody really investing
in a, uh, not just seniors,

905
00:50:28,821 --> 00:50:32,060
but demographics of audiences that
are not traditionally invested in,

906
00:50:32,061 --> 00:50:35,300
I think is awesome. And that's what
I'm really excited about. Great.

907
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:38,510
Thank you so much and thank you for
coming today. Thanks for having me.

908
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:40,370
Thank you everyone for coming here.
