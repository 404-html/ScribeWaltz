1
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,490
Welcome. Thank you for coming. Um,

2
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,700
I guess we can take a seat or something
like that. We can also stand up.

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,220
I don't really have a preference.
I'm

4
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,360
welcome here today. You're a Texan and
see if I'm allowed to call you that.

5
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:31,010
Eh, I mean I've been in talks
with you for a little while.

6
00:00:31,011 --> 00:00:32,150
I am super,

7
00:00:32,151 --> 00:00:36,290
super excited about you coming today and
talking to us and telling us about what

8
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:41,210
you do. Um, but before we begin, since
I've been at Google for a very long time,

9
00:00:41,211 --> 00:00:43,460
but I also know people
that are working the Mba,

10
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:47,990
MBA embassies and in diplomacy and adds
a lot of a different approach to things.

11
00:00:47,991 --> 00:00:51,380
Can you please just tell me about
your first meeting with Google in this

12
00:00:51,381 --> 00:00:52,610
capacity as an ambassador?

13
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,670
Yeah, no. Well first of all, thanks for,

14
00:00:54,671 --> 00:00:59,140
for hosting me today and thanks also
for listening again. Um, yeah, I'm,

15
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,910
I'm a career diplomat. So
you know, normally this is
the kind of gear that the,

16
00:01:02,911 --> 00:01:05,360
that you wear and we're here
because of the UN General Assembly.

17
00:01:05,361 --> 00:01:09,950
So a suits and actually ties. This is sort
of part of the uniform today. But, uh,

18
00:01:09,951 --> 00:01:12,560
when I arrived in Silicon
Valley a 12 months ago,

19
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,860
I had one of the first meetings we had
was actually in mountain view with,

20
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:17,570
with the Google headquarters. And, uh,

21
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:21,530
it was a clash of two different
cultures and to some extent the class of

22
00:01:21,531 --> 00:01:24,290
civilizations because, uh,
together with my tech bitsy,

23
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:28,460
we went there and more or less dressed
like this and our counterpart came out

24
00:01:28,461 --> 00:01:31,610
and flip flops and a shorter shorts and a,

25
00:01:31,611 --> 00:01:33,410
and I think in the old
Metallica tee shirt.

26
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:36,620
And we actually have a fantastic picture
where we standing next to each other.

27
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:37,641
And for me,

28
00:01:37,641 --> 00:01:40,410
this was sort of the wake up call that
we actually need a dialogue but two

29
00:01:40,411 --> 00:01:44,050
different worlds. And the after that we
also went out to buy a lot of the gene,

30
00:01:44,051 --> 00:01:45,050
some of those white sneaker.

31
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,890
So now the uniform is different and
we are also in that area a little bit

32
00:01:48,891 --> 00:01:51,470
different than what diplomats
and I'll be like, yeah,

33
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:55,850
I did hear about you saying that you'd
made really poor financial decisions.

34
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,070
I have too many suits. Spacing. Okay.

35
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,380
So, uh, you're the world's first, uh,

36
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,710
Eh tech ambassador appointed by a country.
Um,

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,990
can you explain to the audience a little
bit more about what a tech ambassador

38
00:02:12,991 --> 00:02:15,690
does and the whole idea behind it?

39
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,750
Yeah, sure. Well, if we,
if we go back to or euro,

40
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,370
so on perhaps one and a half years ago,
um,

41
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:26,570
there was a in innovation processes inside
the Danish government and inside the

42
00:02:26,571 --> 00:02:30,440
foreign ministry where we looked a
little bit on trends and how to bring

43
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,120
basically the foreign ministry.

44
00:02:32,121 --> 00:02:36,950
And so the 21st century and a and some
very talented younger colleagues came up

45
00:02:36,951 --> 00:02:39,500
with a number of different ideas
and one of them was so point,

46
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,990
I'll take ambassador. Um, and,

47
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:47,550
and the reason for this are two trends.
If we look at it, one, one being the,

48
00:02:47,551 --> 00:02:50,480
we think technology and probably I don't
have to convince anybody in this room

49
00:02:50,481 --> 00:02:51,890
or anybody watching him,

50
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,740
that technology is going to be one of
the main drivers for global development.

51
00:02:55,741 --> 00:02:57,920
And it's going to have a
lot of positive effects,

52
00:02:57,921 --> 00:03:02,010
but it might also have a couple challenges
along the way. In other words, uh,

53
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,650
technology will be defining the
winners and losers of tomorrow,

54
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,800
but it will also define some
of the foreign policy or
international relations of

55
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:14,590
this world. Uh, also balance
of power where I think
things like machine learning,

56
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:15,670
artificial intelligence,

57
00:03:15,671 --> 00:03:20,671
perhaps even iot is going to be as
important as a conventional weapons or,

58
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:22,200
or even nuclear weapons.
So,

59
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:26,390
so the mindset of looking at technology
from a foreign policy point of view, uh,

60
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,090
goes to the core of this initiative.

61
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:33,340
And the other trend or the other main
reason why we did this was of course,

62
00:03:33,341 --> 00:03:36,960
um, and this one I know I don't
have to convince anybody about, uh,

63
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,070
sitting here today, is that some of
the big technology companies now,

64
00:03:40,071 --> 00:03:44,890
at least in the u s are becoming
very, very big, very influential,

65
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,140
not least with the platforms
that you guys said,

66
00:03:47,141 --> 00:03:49,060
development and build an utilize.

67
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,330
But we also see in increasingly that,

68
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:57,390
that companies are perhaps using that
platform power also to begin influencing

69
00:03:58,301 --> 00:04:01,690
policies and, and the, the
direction of this world.

70
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,030
So we basically are,

71
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:08,910
the Danish come visit is decided that
instead of just watching the future past

72
00:04:08,911 --> 00:04:10,150
by outside the windows,

73
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:14,290
we wanted to actually begin treating
the industry and technology and

74
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:17,290
digitalization as a
foreign policy priority.

75
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:22,291
And by creating this a first ever et seq
representation and begin dealing with

76
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:23,890
these issues to see,

77
00:04:23,891 --> 00:04:27,380
to influence the direction despite
being a very small country. And,

78
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:32,450
and what if like with a company like
Google have to gain by engaging immediate

79
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,440
with the tech ambassador?

80
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:40,900
I think you have a few more users than the
size of the Danish population. Um, but,

81
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:44,710
but, but I think, I think the basic
idea behind this is actually that we,

82
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,970
we can't do it alone.

83
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,210
I think government is always
trailing behind our new technologies.

84
00:04:49,211 --> 00:04:53,620
We don't necessarily get it right
on regulations, on legislation.

85
00:04:53,621 --> 00:04:56,560
Our policies are being challenged
because of the fast pace of these new

86
00:04:56,561 --> 00:04:57,394
technologies.

87
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:01,120
And whether you call it the digital
age or the fourth industrial revolution

88
00:05:01,121 --> 00:05:04,660
doesn't really matter because
I think the gap is widening on,

89
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,220
on our ability as governments,

90
00:05:06,221 --> 00:05:09,790
always international organizations
to actually sort of cope with the,

91
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,410
with the future.
Um,

92
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:15,250
but I don't think that companies
are able to do it alone either.

93
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,260
And of course we might
discuss a couple of,

94
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,200
of examples over the last couple
of months or the last year or so.

95
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,620
But I think the point here is that we
need each other and we need to work closer

96
00:05:23,621 --> 00:05:27,810
together than we have perhaps in the
past. And we need to find a, you know,

97
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,010
joint solutions on some of the big issues,

98
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,110
both global issues but
also national issues.

99
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,530
So this is basically a very big,
warm,

100
00:05:35,531 --> 00:05:38,860
fuzzy huck on the Danish
government to the tech industry,

101
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:44,190
but also a sort of subtle way of saying
we need to come closer together and we

102
00:05:44,741 --> 00:05:46,320
need to define together,
uh,

103
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,610
solutions to some of the big
issues that we are faced with.

104
00:05:48,611 --> 00:05:53,070
Also on a global level. And then as
we talked about, you know, that's,

105
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,550
there's one part where
you're always saying, oh,

106
00:05:54,551 --> 00:05:58,190
governments are trailing
behind and digitalization
for governments and all that,

107
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:03,190
but tech companies as well needs to
also be really add a level of how

108
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:07,040
governments are thinking about protecting
their inhabitants and own protective,

109
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:10,910
but also offering them opportunities
and that they can get get caught behind.

110
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:14,500
And this like global tech
revolution that we'll see.

111
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,430
Let's just call it the
fourth industrial revolution.

112
00:06:16,431 --> 00:06:19,220
I think that's a nice term for it
because there's so many things that are

113
00:06:19,221 --> 00:06:21,590
happening out there.
Um,

114
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,070
just to dial it back a little
bit because we start out,

115
00:06:25,071 --> 00:06:28,880
we always talk about it like
it's Denmark and full disclosure,

116
00:06:28,881 --> 00:06:31,460
I am from Denmark.
I've been living here for eight years,

117
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:36,170
but I still have a very
big stake in thinking how
interesting this is. You know,

118
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:41,300
so maybe you could explain
to the world why Denmark,

119
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:45,110
such a small little country on the
northern tip of Europe with the population

120
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:47,540
size of Colorado for Americans.
You know,

121
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:50,240
why is it Denmark of all
countries that start,

122
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,720
that becomes the first to a point,

123
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:58,280
a tech ambassador and gives them the
mandate you to go out there and try and

124
00:06:58,281 --> 00:06:59,450
engage with us.

125
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:02,020
What do think are the three reasons
why we came up with this? I mean,

126
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:05,200
first of all, we have some extremely
talented younger colleagues who,

127
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,950
who saw this and who came up with the
idea and who were able to convince the

128
00:07:08,951 --> 00:07:13,100
senior management back home that we
needed to go in this direction. Um, the,

129
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,900
the other reason is, uh,
is of course that um,

130
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:22,180
we have a little bit of street cred
on digitalization because we are very

131
00:07:22,181 --> 00:07:26,050
digital country. We are, uh,
where they look at a UN, uh,

132
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,090
assessments or European Union assessments.

133
00:07:28,091 --> 00:07:30,580
We normally come out at the top of the,

134
00:07:30,581 --> 00:07:33,700
of these assessments in terms
of public digitalization.

135
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,460
You probably know that 90%, uh, of, uh,

136
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,110
of all communications
between the government and
citizens in Denmark are today

137
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,590
electronic. I think that's a, an all time
world record, which means that you move,

138
00:07:44,591 --> 00:07:46,540
my grandmother needs a
new driver's license.

139
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:51,120
She has to log onto a computer and
go online to actually get that. Um,

140
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:55,600
so we have, we have a tradition
for being quite digital and,

141
00:07:55,601 --> 00:08:00,520
and also using this as an actual thing.
Um, if you look at something which,

142
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:04,760
which every single day in the has,
that's a civil registry system,

143
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:08,300
something called the CPR
system is basically, um,

144
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,430
a number of a personal identification
number that is given to you within minutes

145
00:08:12,431 --> 00:08:15,610
after your birth and it follows
you throughout your life.

146
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:19,540
And that contains a lot of the data
that the other countries are today

147
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,650
discussing.
Whether you need a sort of a,

148
00:08:21,651 --> 00:08:24,770
a whole of government
approach or universal, uh,

149
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:29,590
identification system where you can store
medical records or educational records

150
00:08:29,591 --> 00:08:33,410
and so on and so forth. And that's an
integral part of, of the Danish society.

151
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:37,460
And I think it's also one of the reasons
why we have a high degree of trust in,

152
00:08:37,461 --> 00:08:39,130
in public government.

153
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:42,850
And that's perhaps actually one
of the differences between, uh,

154
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:47,410
between Denmark and the US. We tend to
trust the government quite a lot. Uh,

155
00:08:47,411 --> 00:08:50,360
I think at least in the part of the world
or part of the US where I'm living in,

156
00:08:50,361 --> 00:08:53,860
in silicon valley, the, there seems
to be a little larger trust in,

157
00:08:53,861 --> 00:08:56,320
in the private sector and in,
but,

158
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,140
but the way we use the trust in
government is that we have the system, uh,

159
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:02,660
it hasn't been breached or hacked,
um,

160
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,310
yet and hopefully it will never do that.

161
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:09,250
But it actually offers a lot
of opportunities for using
the states at which is a

162
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:12,200
available.
So I think those two,

163
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:15,120
three things are one of the reasons
why we came up with the idea.

164
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,490
But the last one being that we have
always been a small country in Oakland

165
00:09:19,491 --> 00:09:22,860
country, very dependent on
others also because of our size.

166
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,100
So looking into how we prepare
ourselves for the future.

167
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,990
What will it mean for our labor market?
What will it mean for, for global affairs?

168
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,800
How can we continue to take a,

169
00:09:32,801 --> 00:09:37,650
a responsible approach to helping other
parts of the world that are perhaps

170
00:09:37,651 --> 00:09:41,790
doing less well than we are cells. That's
the last, the reason why I think we, we,

171
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:42,960
we took this initiative

172
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,980
and then that vein and our history of
using big data as a way of the population

173
00:09:52,431 --> 00:09:57,300
and trusting the governments with our
data. And you know, we, it is quite wild.

174
00:09:57,301 --> 00:09:58,134
So thinking about that,

175
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:03,260
the government XSL access to all your
health information and all your income and

176
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:08,670
tax information on all these things.
And do you feel that that's a,

177
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,280
a driving force that the,
the, the government, the,

178
00:10:11,281 --> 00:10:12,930
the population of 10 Max has all right,

179
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:18,890
we trust the government to forge these
relationships with tech companies.

180
00:10:19,111 --> 00:10:21,840
And this is why it's not the u s a China,

181
00:10:21,841 --> 00:10:24,150
France that's gone out
and done this initiative.

182
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,270
By the way, we, we
might come back to that.

183
00:10:27,271 --> 00:10:30,150
Other countries are looking at what
we're doing with quite a lot of interest.

184
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:33,430
And I think a lot of other countries
are considering whether to a point tick

185
00:10:33,431 --> 00:10:34,320
ambassadors,

186
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:38,430
whether it'll be in silicon valley or in
Beijing or in one Joe or somewhere else.

187
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,200
I think that's not the important bit.

188
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,170
But the fact that other concerts that
are getting inspiration for what we're

189
00:10:43,171 --> 00:10:46,800
doing and acknowledging that we need
to treat technology and teach it so

190
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,430
platforms in a more
systematic way is positive.

191
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:54,720
So some extent it's part of my KPI that
we deliver other countries also because

192
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:57,270
it's super lonely to sit out
in Palo Alto all by yourself.

193
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,340
I really missed the
National Day receptions,

194
00:10:59,341 --> 00:11:01,800
which is such an important
part of diplomacy these days.

195
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:06,350
I don't actually put that nobody is
watching. Right. So it can be completed.

196
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,950
They will eventually. Yeah, I'm a
blog but, but, but, but, but I think,

197
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,860
I think the trust thing is important but,

198
00:11:12,861 --> 00:11:15,420
but I also be very honest
sitting here in front of, of,

199
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,890
of techies who understand this
much better than I do. You know,

200
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:21,530
we have a high degree
of, of confidence, uh,

201
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,450
between the citizens of Denmark and the
public sector. When you look at the,

202
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:31,200
at sort of perception data
on globalization or where
the world is heading,

203
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:35,750
the Danes, I'm generally also quite
optimistic. They look at the future in a,

204
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,930
in a positive light,

205
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:42,000
even despite of global affairs and issues
that you might point to a currently.

206
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,990
But I think it's also fair to say it
doesn't take too much or too many.

207
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:50,700
Facebook came [inaudible] a case
cases to perhaps tilt that confidence.

208
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:55,440
Um, and we spoke a little bit about
the civil registry system before. Um,

209
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,360
and of course one of the reasons people
trust us is because it hasn't been

210
00:11:58,361 --> 00:12:01,990
preached, it hasn't been hacked,
eh, but one could imagine of course,

211
00:12:01,991 --> 00:12:05,660
that the public trust
in the systems and uh,

212
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:08,770
could go sour if we see
more of these big scandals.

213
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:12,760
So that's another reason why we need a
conversation with technology companies.

214
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,240
And that's one of the reasons why we
have a lot of focus right now on data

215
00:12:16,241 --> 00:12:18,890
ethics,
on also on cyber security issues.

216
00:12:18,891 --> 00:12:23,010
So we make sure we protect these systems
against the mullein excess basically.

217
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,890
And I would also say as a comment,
you know,

218
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,600
working at Google and I've been here
for these last nine almost 10 years,

219
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,720
it's what's happened over the last year,
you know,

220
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:36,950
has sort of for the first time,
from a personal perspective,

221
00:12:36,951 --> 00:12:38,970
I work on these platforms is,

222
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:42,860
is that we are all of a sudden on the
wrong side of the trust conversation.

223
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:46,070
Right. That's kind of new for us. You
know, it's always the government's,

224
00:12:46,071 --> 00:12:50,380
that's that the, that, the public's
mistrusts it's usually the, the,

225
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:54,650
the tech companies have been good beacons
and stewards of all this data and all

226
00:12:54,651 --> 00:12:57,290
these things, which we still
are, but it's just the,

227
00:12:57,291 --> 00:13:00,620
the fact is that many of the things
that we offer and have has far reaching

228
00:13:00,621 --> 00:13:04,940
implications that we might not
have been able to, um, to predict.

229
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:08,060
But I can say that the
discourse internally in the
company is very much what you

230
00:13:08,061 --> 00:13:11,350
were saying that like we need to make
sure that we get around as good to hear.

231
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess
that's also why you're here
today. You know, it's not a, Oh,

232
00:13:15,891 --> 00:13:17,690
take the promise here.
We're just going to shut the door.

233
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,120
It is a thing that's on everybody's mind.

234
00:13:20,121 --> 00:13:24,650
And we can also see that a lot of audience
here is, that's a good point, right?

235
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:29,360
Uh, but let's, um, I started
out saying, you know,

236
00:13:29,361 --> 00:13:33,180
ask questions cause technology
can really cover everything. It's,

237
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,160
there's not a lot of things that's
not influenced by technology.

238
00:13:37,161 --> 00:13:41,150
Your water's Datadriven, you know,
it's everything that is put into it.

239
00:13:41,151 --> 00:13:44,630
That's tech driven water,
whatever. But I would say that,

240
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,350
um,

241
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:52,900
a fair question could be what have been
at the core of your work the last 12

242
00:13:54,441 --> 00:13:58,250
months that you've been a
tech ambassador? Yeah. Well

243
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:02,620
one of the differences between the job I
have now and some of the jobs I've been

244
00:14:02,621 --> 00:14:07,150
doing previously is I get one
question all the time. You know,

245
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,840
what on earth are you doing and what are
the success criteria for actually doing

246
00:14:10,841 --> 00:14:14,950
that? And I can tell you nobody who
came directly from Jakarta in Indonesia,

247
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,430
nobody ever asked me the question,
what do you actually do?

248
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,880
And what's the added value of,
of having an embassy in Indonesia?

249
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,110
We're having an invest in Indonesia.

250
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:28,210
I get that question question the all
the time and my answer is not very sexy,

251
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:28,551
but,
uh,

252
00:14:28,551 --> 00:14:32,590
I'll give it to you unless what we are
trying to do is basically elevate our

253
00:14:32,591 --> 00:14:35,740
dialogue with the tech industry where
the companies but also with other

254
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:38,170
countries and international organizations.
I mean,

255
00:14:38,171 --> 00:14:40,750
it's not a coincidence we're
meeting today, uh, during the,

256
00:14:40,751 --> 00:14:44,020
the UN General Assembly week because
technology and digitalization is going to

257
00:14:44,021 --> 00:14:48,130
be an important topic you're on
development on, on the future of a,

258
00:14:48,131 --> 00:14:50,240
of multilateral systems.
Um,

259
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,080
but the core of what we are trying to do
and what my team is trying to do is to

260
00:14:54,081 --> 00:14:59,081
offer to dangerous authorities a formulas
platform for having a dialogue with

261
00:14:59,511 --> 00:15:03,090
companies like Google or some
of the others [inaudible] eh,

262
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,020
on a wide range of topics.
And what does that mean?

263
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:08,330
It means that we're doing
exactly the same as a,

264
00:15:08,331 --> 00:15:11,710
as other embassies all over the world.
Not only dangerous emphasis, but you know,

265
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:16,730
US embassies or a Belgian embassies and
that is representing his authorities on

266
00:15:17,571 --> 00:15:19,970
whatever topic might be
relevant. So, in other words,

267
00:15:19,971 --> 00:15:23,390
one day it might be coming to to mountain
view and say we'd like a conversation

268
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,810
about data privacy.
Uh,

269
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:29,480
the next day it might be a question of
digital taxation because that's a topic

270
00:15:29,481 --> 00:15:33,650
that is very much on the agenda in Europe
these days. A third day it might be,

271
00:15:33,651 --> 00:15:34,700
you know,
how could,

272
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:39,490
how could we get access or convince Google
to do investments in data centers in,

273
00:15:39,491 --> 00:15:40,324
in Denmark.

274
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,910
And the third day it might be on some
difficult questions on how do we avoid

275
00:15:43,911 --> 00:15:48,080
platforms being misused for, for
radicalization, extremism or terrorism.

276
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,530
So that wide range of topics is there.
It goes to the core.

277
00:15:51,531 --> 00:15:54,800
What we're trying to to do, I think
it's important to say that this is,

278
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:58,280
this is not a pessimistic tick agenda.
Um,

279
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:01,610
and I'm not saying this to be
friendly to techies in this room, uh,

280
00:16:01,611 --> 00:16:06,170
but this is really about the use using
and reaping all the opportunities that

281
00:16:06,171 --> 00:16:07,310
technology brings about.

282
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:11,270
And when we fundamentally think that
technology will do good for this world,

283
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,200
but we also have a realistic view on it
where we think we have to work together

284
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:15,801
with Google,

285
00:16:15,801 --> 00:16:19,310
with others to make sure that we mitigate
those areas where they're the real

286
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,830
dangers and we'll difficulties,
for example,

287
00:16:21,831 --> 00:16:25,970
on creating sort of global inequality
or a digital poor part of this world,

288
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:29,320
which I personally think is going
to be one of the major challenges.

289
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:33,410
Getting the remaining three and a half
billion people online so they can also

290
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,510
reap the benefits of these issues.

291
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,350
But at the core of what we're trying to
do is really this government to industry

292
00:16:39,351 --> 00:16:43,160
conversation. And in that sense, what
I do is very old school. In fact,

293
00:16:43,161 --> 00:16:47,060
I would argue that it's sort of
bringing in diplomacy back to its roots.

294
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:51,170
A diplomacy has always been about putting
people into hotspots where changes

295
00:16:51,171 --> 00:16:51,980
were under way.

296
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:56,510
In the old days it was typically into
a wall prone areas or where conflict

297
00:16:56,511 --> 00:16:59,630
existed. Today, it's about
putting a diplomat's into,

298
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,590
into the heart of Silicon Valley so that
we can have conversations with you guys

299
00:17:03,591 --> 00:17:08,030
on how we fix the world or we make sure
that we don't undermine some of the key

300
00:17:08,031 --> 00:17:11,660
values and institutions that we've
been working on for very long time.

301
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:17,620
Yeah. And I think it was a small,
easy issues and small, easy as yours.

302
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:21,520
But like we got to also have to got
with fact that there's something called

303
00:17:21,521 --> 00:17:24,400
legislation that you guys represent.
You know,

304
00:17:24,401 --> 00:17:28,870
and we must looking at legislation,

305
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:33,360
which is a tool you guys have is a tool
that the governments have view the US.

306
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:34,270
Everybody has,
you know,

307
00:17:34,271 --> 00:17:38,020
you can say legislation and technology's
definitely does not always move at the

308
00:17:38,021 --> 00:17:40,000
same speed.
Uh,

309
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,510
and obviously we can talk
about Gdpr as an example.

310
00:17:43,511 --> 00:17:48,030
Many people in here has been involved
with that. And, uh, it's, it's, it's,

311
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:52,440
well, it's, it's, it, it has been
in the works for several years.

312
00:17:52,441 --> 00:17:56,040
When we look at how long
it takes from the disease,

313
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,960
an example to actually be put
into practice, you know, we,

314
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,220
we can also see that in California.

315
00:18:02,221 --> 00:18:06,330
They can push the consumer privacy act
through and I guess two months that was

316
00:18:06,331 --> 00:18:09,810
real fast that they do these things.
That's a part of it that's very,

317
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:14,870
very interesting to how legislation
and the political agendas and all that.

318
00:18:16,201 --> 00:18:20,220
It's not always fine tune to come with
our emergency entirely and they will look

319
00:18:20,221 --> 00:18:23,850
at what is coming up with
blockchain and AI. You know,

320
00:18:23,851 --> 00:18:26,560
when we look at decision
making and governance, um,

321
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,130
what do you feel that we,

322
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,360
you and I and everybody else I can do
to close the gap between technology and

323
00:18:33,361 --> 00:18:37,620
regulation and we can start
saying what can governments do?

324
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:38,993
Well,

325
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,920
a couple of different angles
on the questions of course,

326
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:46,510
the million dollar question, how do we
fix these issues? Well, I think from a,

327
00:18:46,511 --> 00:18:47,560
from a government point of view,

328
00:18:47,561 --> 00:18:52,420
we have to recognize that we are going
to be challenged over the next couple of

329
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,830
years or the next decade because of
the piece of new technologies. Uh,

330
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:58,270
you mentioned blockchain.
I think Iot is another good example.

331
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:01,300
And of course machine learning
and artificial intelligence
is probably going to

332
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:05,790
transcend everything we do. I mean,
no sector will be left untouched.

333
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,910
No industry will be left on touch and
therefore no government will be left

334
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:15,020
untouched. Um, I think from
the industry side, um, and,

335
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,640
and I don't want to be sort
of a too rough on big tick,

336
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,680
but what I would say is that I think we
have a shared responsibility here. Um,

337
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:26,530
one of the things that I continue to
argue quite a lot is that we might not see

338
00:19:26,531 --> 00:19:29,170
eye to eye between Europe and
the u s and some of these issues.

339
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:34,060
There has been a bit of tech ash in Europe
and I think on the US side there has

340
00:19:34,061 --> 00:19:35,590
been perhaps some,
uh,

341
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:39,310
some concerns about the direction that
Europe is taking GDPR being one of them.

342
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:42,730
I think antitrust legislation,
uh, is another one,

343
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,520
but it doesn't change the fact that we
have to stick together because we're

344
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:50,530
still products of the same values that
we paid a very high price to, to get to.

345
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:54,730
Um, at the conclusion of that is that we
have to work also to find the right way

346
00:19:54,731 --> 00:19:57,600
forward. And, and just to take one
example, if you allow me, restaurants,

347
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:02,200
digital taxation, I know it's a tricky
issue. It's a tricky issue in Europe.

348
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,580
And I know it's a tricky issue also with,

349
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:07,450
with headquarters or taking the
industries. But if you look at Europe,

350
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:12,370
technology companies pay around half of
what traditional companies are paying in

351
00:20:12,371 --> 00:20:15,520
Texas. And you could say, well,
that's a smarter way of operating.

352
00:20:15,521 --> 00:20:17,170
But for the most European countries,

353
00:20:17,171 --> 00:20:21,520
this is an existential issue because
this is what basically undermines our

354
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:26,440
ability to pay for education or healthcare
basically to uphold the welfare state.

355
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:30,200
Um, there are a couple of proposals
from the European Commission, um,

356
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:34,060
currently being discussed. Um, I don't
think they're particularly popular in,

357
00:20:34,061 --> 00:20:37,030
in mountain view, but you can
correct me if I'm wrong on that one,

358
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:40,600
but it doesn't really change
what I think is the way forward.

359
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:44,800
And that is that we have to work together
on finding solutions also, for example,

360
00:20:44,801 --> 00:20:46,990
in digital cessation.
So what I mean by that,

361
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:51,940
I think we need to answer sort of into
a contract where we come to the industry

362
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:54,100
also looking for advice,

363
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:58,270
looking for some suggestions on
what is the right way forward,

364
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:03,400
not to stifle innovation to make sure
that we have a protech pro platform

365
00:21:03,401 --> 00:21:06,310
environment in Europe.
But we also expect from the,

366
00:21:06,311 --> 00:21:10,090
from the tech industry and from the senior
management teams that they help us to

367
00:21:10,091 --> 00:21:11,260
find the right way forward.

368
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,490
It's not good enough to say we don't
like the European Commission's proposal.

369
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,990
And when you then ask the question,

370
00:21:16,991 --> 00:21:21,210
so what should we do instead in with the
answers? Well, let's not offer us to, uh,

371
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,410
to define. I think it
is. And I think that's,

372
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:27,470
that's where we are today at a
crossroad where we have to expect from,

373
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,540
from the senior management of the tech
industry that they help us define the

374
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:32,231
right way forward.

375
00:21:32,231 --> 00:21:36,220
Whether it is on digital taxation or
whether it's on regulation or whether it's

376
00:21:36,221 --> 00:21:40,060
on legislation because of the absence of
that is not going to help the industry

377
00:21:40,061 --> 00:21:42,490
and it's certainly not going to,
to help the governments or,

378
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:46,750
or in our case Europe
either. So. So that's the way
forward, uh, in, in my view.

379
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:48,790
And that's what we're trying to do
with this initiative by the way.

380
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:53,220
No, I, I see it and I've could
at some point say there's,

381
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:56,400
the communication is pretty much
like one way as you're saying,

382
00:21:56,401 --> 00:21:58,620
like we do get engaged and
say we don't like that,

383
00:21:58,621 --> 00:22:02,610
but maybe we could build a feedback loop
in that sense. But yeah, that takes time.

384
00:22:02,611 --> 00:22:04,300
And that's why you're the
first tech ambassador.

385
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:07,980
She start getting these
feeds going. You know, it's,

386
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:11,790
it's a legislation again, right?
That's the tool that sets in one way.

387
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:15,570
And maybe there's a gap in legislation
in Europe that needs to be fixed and

388
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:18,060
agreed upon by member states
and the European Union.

389
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:22,310
Can I just add one thing?
Restaurants. I mean I think, um,

390
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:26,070
I I don't think are revealing any state
secrets by saying that of course Europe

391
00:22:26,071 --> 00:22:30,330
is not always a United on how we deal
with technology and digitalization,

392
00:22:30,331 --> 00:22:32,820
how we deal with a big
technology companies.

393
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:37,650
There are different views among
the 28, uh, or you 27 soon.

394
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,200
Um, but, but what we often,

395
00:22:40,201 --> 00:22:42,660
and I think that goes a little bit
back to one of your first questions.

396
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:43,411
What's the,

397
00:22:43,411 --> 00:22:47,370
what's the value proposition that we
bring also to a company like a Google?

398
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,900
Well that is to have a dialogue also the
issues we might not see eye to eye on.

399
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,770
It's also an opportunity to begin
discussing, you know, how to,

400
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:00,450
how do we create the regulation or
tomorrow so it doesn't undermine the

401
00:23:00,451 --> 00:23:04,020
commercial activities of the taking the,
which is perfectly fine for us.

402
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:07,050
We don't have any problems
with monopolies. We don't
have any problems with,

403
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:12,180
with companies growing and making money.
As long as that is not misused,

404
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:16,320
that dominant position is not being
misused. So I think, you know,

405
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,980
companies like a Google or
Facebook or Alibaba and others,

406
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:21,600
they will find no better friends than a,

407
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:25,380
than Denmark in the sense that we've
always been light on regulation,

408
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,340
but we always been right on regulators.

409
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,510
We have to make sure that we go in
where it matters also to protect our

410
00:23:30,511 --> 00:23:34,900
institutions and democracy
and human rights or the big
stuff, which, which is, uh,

411
00:23:34,901 --> 00:23:38,550
important and which we fought quite a
long time for over several centuries.

412
00:23:38,551 --> 00:23:40,800
We have to make sure we don't
undermine those institutions.

413
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,580
And having that discussion and
bringing the two parties together,

414
00:23:44,581 --> 00:23:47,510
I think is going to be
essential in the next decade.

415
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:49,950
And I think from a personal
perspective and all that,

416
00:23:49,951 --> 00:23:53,910
and I think it's been for many that it
is actually a point where we should get

417
00:23:53,911 --> 00:23:58,570
to, you know, it's technology moves
at such an increasingly fast paced,

418
00:23:58,590 --> 00:23:59,610
even if you are in it,

419
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:04,350
you're not necessarily always able to
predict the influences it has all around.

420
00:24:04,351 --> 00:24:07,080
And this is the, the
exponential change, right?

421
00:24:07,081 --> 00:24:10,470
It is faster and faster and faster than
Moore's law and all these things and the

422
00:24:10,471 --> 00:24:11,790
human brain thinks linearly.

423
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:15,870
And so there's organizations you
don't necessarily get into that,

424
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:19,290
but we'll try and get ahead of that.
And it would be the,

425
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:24,420
the aspiration and that sense
and why you are here. But, um,

426
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:26,520
let's try and,
um,

427
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:31,110
look a little bit of a wider perspective
because your mandate is actually global,

428
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:31,351
right?

429
00:24:31,351 --> 00:24:34,680
Like we've been talking about the u s
the European Union and all these like

430
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:37,960
complicated dense matters that are there.
But let's talk a little bit about like,

431
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:43,060
we have some exciting opportunities
is out in the tech diplomacy.

432
00:24:43,171 --> 00:24:46,710
So, uh, your team is Kinda like you,

433
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:51,240
you work from mountain where you work
from Silicon Valley. Sorry about that.

434
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:51,961
But you know,

435
00:24:51,961 --> 00:24:56,280
we also have a part of your
team is situated in Copenhagen
and in Beijing. Yeah.

436
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,660
For you, what does it actually mean to
be an ambassador to a global industry?

437
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:03,770
No, it's not just, it means
having meetings at horrible times.

438
00:25:03,771 --> 00:25:07,350
So almost everyday because
finding a common time to,

439
00:25:07,351 --> 00:25:08,490
to have the whole team present,

440
00:25:08,491 --> 00:25:12,070
there's basically impossible because
of the time differences. Um, this,

441
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,010
this is also a foreign policy experiment.

442
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,920
I think it's important to mention
that we haven't done it before.

443
00:25:16,921 --> 00:25:18,570
We don't think anybody
else has done it before,

444
00:25:18,571 --> 00:25:22,080
but we think it's the right way to
look at diplomas in the 21st century.

445
00:25:22,081 --> 00:25:25,320
That it's not only about having
a one embassy to one country,

446
00:25:25,321 --> 00:25:29,550
but it's in fact looking at, at a,
at an industry or a sector in a,

447
00:25:29,551 --> 00:25:33,000
in a holistic way. Um, again,

448
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,590
I represent the foreign ministry.

449
00:25:34,591 --> 00:25:37,850
So it goes without saying that we are
focusing on the global aspects of,

450
00:25:37,851 --> 00:25:40,010
of new technology. Um, so,

451
00:25:40,011 --> 00:25:43,200
so I think if you look at
the u s or the America is,

452
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:47,040
if you look at Europe and if look
at Asia, uh, changes on the way, um,

453
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:52,790
it goes without saying that there is
a shift or a change also in balance of

454
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:56,990
power. Uh, I think when you look into the
crystal ball, it's evident that, you know,

455
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,660
in Europe received, we'll move
east, I guess where we're sitting.

456
00:26:00,661 --> 00:26:05,000
It could also move a west. But, but
the point being that, um, you know,

457
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:08,500
China and other Asian countries,
Eh,

458
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:11,850
look as though they're going
to be using technology as a,

459
00:26:11,851 --> 00:26:16,170
as a game changer also for their position
on the global scene. It's interesting,

460
00:26:16,171 --> 00:26:19,490
you've look at investments in
artificial intelligence. The last year,

461
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:24,370
venture capital investments,
I think a 30% or so went to the u s uh,

462
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:28,710
48% went to, to China and the rest
went to the rest of the world.

463
00:26:28,711 --> 00:26:30,450
Which by the way includes
two European Union.

464
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:35,870
I think it doesn't require too much
creativity to see that that's perhaps the

465
00:26:35,941 --> 00:26:40,941
contours of the new global order and a
and that we might see technology being a,

466
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:45,360
being a, you know, a driver for
significant change. I in the global scene,

467
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,340
I think what we're struggling in
Europe is of course to have, you know,

468
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,270
a better focus on innovation.

469
00:26:51,271 --> 00:26:55,920
We need to also build some of the Unicorns
that the US and China and the Asia is

470
00:26:55,921 --> 00:26:58,010
extremely good at doing.
Um,

471
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:02,790
and I think that requires us to take a
look on, on regulations, on legislation,

472
00:27:02,791 --> 00:27:06,540
but it also requires us to take a look
on mindsets and perhaps a little bit on

473
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:10,110
access to capital for some
of these big companies. Um,

474
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:13,470
I think Europe has a role to play. I
know we're sitting in New York, but, but,

475
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:17,460
but I think Europe could play a role in
the sense of help define the boundaries

476
00:27:17,461 --> 00:27:20,490
for newer technology.
I know that Gdpr,

477
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,240
the data protection regulation is
not necessarily popular everywhere.

478
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,790
It's not popular everywhere in Europe,

479
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:28,650
either with small and
medium size enterprises.

480
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:33,240
But it's a first attempt to try and define
the boundaries and to make it crystal

481
00:27:33,241 --> 00:27:35,550
clear that data is something
which is also personal,

482
00:27:35,551 --> 00:27:39,660
something that you can own yourself and
that you have the right to be forgotten,

483
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:42,900
uh, further down the road.
Is it perfect? Perhaps not,

484
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,560
but it's an attempt to try and set some
boundaries for new technologies between

485
00:27:46,561 --> 00:27:50,790
sort of the wild west of silicon valley
where everything goes and where it's all

486
00:27:50,791 --> 00:27:55,130
about building and creating, uh, but
also the the wild east where you see the,

487
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:59,340
the utilization of new technologies
happening in perhaps not an unregulated

488
00:27:59,341 --> 00:28:02,400
space but certainly a speech which is
very different than what we see in Europe

489
00:28:02,401 --> 00:28:05,010
by now. So, so again, from
from our point of view,

490
00:28:05,011 --> 00:28:06,570
from a foreign ministry point of view,

491
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:10,830
this is is also about looking at where
the world is going to be not only in five

492
00:28:10,831 --> 00:28:15,150
years but also in 15 years or 25 years
because that matters even though you are

493
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:19,380
a very small country at the top of your,
no. Yeah. Now you're talking about,

494
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:23,880
I guess looking at when we talk
about the China and all that,

495
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,860
you're looking into
like the private sphere,

496
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:27,840
what sort of invasion we can find there.

497
00:28:27,841 --> 00:28:31,470
But we are talking also a little
bit about like influences,

498
00:28:31,471 --> 00:28:34,860
voiding policy and all that. Yeah.
Which we were talking about before.

499
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:39,300
What kind of like similarities
or differences do you
see between trying to do

500
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:42,000
that in the u s and Europe and in Asia?

501
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,410
Trying to get in there and see if you
can influence that and the foreign policy

502
00:28:46,411 --> 00:28:48,330
side.
Yeah,

503
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:52,740
it goes without saying that we've been
spending quite a lot of time with US

504
00:28:52,741 --> 00:28:56,450
technology companies to begin
with. Um, also again for,

505
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:00,100
for Trans Atlantic reasons, we think
it's important to stay together and,

506
00:29:00,101 --> 00:29:02,980
and where we've been trying
to do is, is to use, um,

507
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,520
all diplomatic tools,

508
00:29:05,521 --> 00:29:09,930
which is going to have going into the
headquarters to have conversations trying

509
00:29:09,931 --> 00:29:14,460
to convince in a gentle and nice way the
headquarters to begin focusing more on

510
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,294
some of these issues.

511
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:19,790
Also to take action in in particular
areas where we might have issues or

512
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,570
challenges. Uh, that has worked
well with some companies,

513
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:26,370
perhaps a little less well with,
with other companies.

514
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:30,120
Some of it is also because of
curiosity. You know, what is this about?

515
00:29:30,121 --> 00:29:32,460
Is this sick Plumas initiative?

516
00:29:32,461 --> 00:29:36,360
Is this all about bringing the big
stick of regulation and trying to, to,

517
00:29:36,361 --> 00:29:40,170
to do damage to the opportunities
that the companies, well, it's not,

518
00:29:40,171 --> 00:29:43,540
and once we've had the opportunity
to explain what we're trying to do,

519
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,250
most companies have said,
well,

520
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:49,230
we actually see that this makes sense
and we would like to work with you on,

521
00:29:49,231 --> 00:29:53,440
on this agenda, but we need more people
around the table. We need more countries,

522
00:29:53,441 --> 00:29:56,720
we need all the international
organizations around the table. Um, it,

523
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,810
which is by the way, one of the
reasons we're sitting in New York.

524
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:01,090
I can join the UN week, uh, you know,

525
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:06,091
we welcome the UN secretary general's
decision to set up a high level panel on

526
00:30:06,761 --> 00:30:09,160
teach Sukkot a corporation.
So I think that's,

527
00:30:09,161 --> 00:30:12,430
and the European Union has done
something similar, uh, under the, uh,

528
00:30:12,431 --> 00:30:16,120
the high representative Mogherini.
So, so I think this is a trend.

529
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,380
We are seeing more countries.

530
00:30:17,381 --> 00:30:21,160
We are seeing international organizations
beginning to step up to the plate and

531
00:30:21,161 --> 00:30:25,120
focusing on, on digital, uh,
issues and on technology proceed.

532
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:28,180
So there are some differences.
And of course there are differences.

533
00:30:28,181 --> 00:30:31,900
Also when you look towards her China,
um, and some of the big companies,

534
00:30:31,901 --> 00:30:33,300
they have their,
uh,

535
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,970
my prime minister is going to
meet Jack Ma later this week.

536
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:40,150
So perhaps I can come back on Friday
and give you feedback on how that

537
00:30:40,151 --> 00:30:43,220
discussion was compared to some of the
other discuss with. That'd be great. Yeah.

538
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:49,760
Um, no, I actually had it's, it is,
it is fascinating. And I'm, you,

539
00:30:49,761 --> 00:30:53,440
you're talking about
the investments into Ai.

540
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:56,810
That's the u s is making the
China's making, which, you know,

541
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:01,330
we move into a decision making
faster decision making world,

542
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,770
um, which is really, yeah, no,

543
00:31:05,771 --> 00:31:09,340
but I want, and this is my own like
little thing. I always feel that,

544
00:31:09,341 --> 00:31:13,870
that's so interesting to look into for
you in 10 years giving everything that

545
00:31:13,871 --> 00:31:16,900
we're doing with Ai.
I never think that in 10 years.

546
00:31:16,901 --> 00:31:18,910
How do you think the Security
Council will look like?

547
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:25,280
I think it'll look more or less
as a dose today. Um, uh, it, it's,

548
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:29,640
they don't think Google have a seat.
Huh? We can do a sweep stake up,

549
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:32,510
see where the, where it hits. Um, I think,

550
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:36,440
I think it's important to
say that although we are
arguing for a closer public

551
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,930
private partnership on
some of the big issues,

552
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:42,850
there are still a domain
which should remain for fo,

553
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,140
for estates and foundations states.

554
00:31:44,141 --> 00:31:49,141
And I think the UN will remain at the
Security Council will remain if fora where

555
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:52,400
states are discussing some
of the big issues. However,

556
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,740
I think what we will see is,
is a,

557
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:59,030
a small revolution where all these
discussions will also take place in the

558
00:31:59,031 --> 00:32:03,110
margins of the UN Oh, in the margins of
the European Union where we begin, uh,

559
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:08,030
having, uh, you know, discussion
groups or discussion for us,

560
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:11,840
uh, to bring about the opportunity to sit
together with the industry and actually

561
00:32:11,841 --> 00:32:14,000
talk about issues including
foreign policy issues,

562
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:17,990
including how do we make sure that you
guys will also take responsibility for

563
00:32:17,991 --> 00:32:20,810
bringing the next 3 billion people online.
Uh,

564
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,620
you will also take responsibility to
make sure that we don't have, again,

565
00:32:24,621 --> 00:32:25,820
parts of this world that will,

566
00:32:25,821 --> 00:32:29,270
we'll fall behind because we shouldn't
forget that this is not only about,

567
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:29,871
you know,

568
00:32:29,871 --> 00:32:34,871
bringing health care or
education to people that are
less fortunate than others.

569
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:38,900
This is also about making sure that the
root causes of extremism or migration,

570
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:43,240
that they will not be nurtured simply
because of global inequality. So,

571
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,510
so these are real issues.

572
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:47,180
There might be commercial opportunities
for a company like Google,

573
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:49,730
but also from a, from a, from
a government point of view,

574
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:54,080
it is incredibly important that we work
together to try and fix some of the, uh,

575
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,470
um, some of the inequalities that
might exist on a global level.

576
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:00,500
And then you answered one of my
next question. I'm sorry about that.

577
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,100
That's completed. That's where we should
go. Right? We should, uh, we should, uh,

578
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,500
meat instead of the problems. Probably
not. You should be verbalizing them,

579
00:33:09,501 --> 00:33:11,960
but diverse, we're talking about like
privacy and fake news and all that and,

580
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,390
and where we are there and
how we can work together.

581
00:33:14,391 --> 00:33:19,391
But I do feel that that's the future of
collaboration and the UN and that if we

582
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:26,110
can talk about like what the last 60
years to find the Security Council and the

583
00:33:26,241 --> 00:33:28,640
end of World War Two and where
are we moving with the Cold War,

584
00:33:28,641 --> 00:33:31,640
whether that's relevant in
the next 10 years perhaps.

585
00:33:31,641 --> 00:33:33,710
But then as we move beyond that,

586
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:37,490
it is bigger challenges that we
will need to partner ourselves.

587
00:33:37,491 --> 00:33:41,510
We cannot have the hammer
of communism or the,

588
00:33:41,511 --> 00:33:44,030
the power of capitalism to solve
some of those trains. Yeah.

589
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,610
On my personal opinion. Anyways. Uh,

590
00:33:46,611 --> 00:33:51,050
I have two more questions left and then
I think I'm going to start opening it up

591
00:33:51,051 --> 00:33:53,700
to the floor for questions.
Um,

592
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:57,710
and um,
uh,

593
00:33:57,711 --> 00:34:01,720
I've been listening to your podcasts
and we also met last year, uh,

594
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,080
right when you became newly
minted, Eh, and uh, you know,

595
00:34:06,081 --> 00:34:09,650
the one thing you did say was
that after the first year,

596
00:34:09,651 --> 00:34:13,970
your success criteria would really be
that you weren't the first and only tech

597
00:34:13,971 --> 00:34:16,400
ambassador. Hello.
How's it going out there

598
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:21,010
relatively well,
but not exactly as good as I hoped.

599
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:25,150
And we are seeing a, you know, a lot
of other countries coming up with,

600
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,320
with similar appointments.

601
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,820
I don't think anybody else had been
given exactly the same title, but Eh,

602
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,241
you know,

603
00:34:31,241 --> 00:34:34,600
I have a group of colleagues around the
world that are dealing with some of the

604
00:34:34,601 --> 00:34:37,010
same topics.
Some of them are called cyber ambassador,

605
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:40,620
some of them are called ambassadors
for digitalization or those are called

606
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:44,130
ambassadors for entrepreneurship
and startups. Um,

607
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:49,120
but I think we will see a wave coming,
uh, in, in not too distant future.

608
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,021
And again,

609
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:53,310
I think that would be absolutely fantastic
on where she think that this is in

610
00:34:53,311 --> 00:34:56,250
the interest of everybody.
Not only the government spent,

611
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:58,720
in fact also the of the industry.
Um,

612
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:02,350
it would also enabled us
to take collective meeting
so you don't have to open

613
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:05,980
the doors every time an individual
take ambassador comes by,

614
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:09,880
but that we can actually begin looking
at how to cooperate together and perhaps

615
00:35:09,881 --> 00:35:12,490
I can deliver. So those small t,
so we're not ready with it yet.

616
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:14,900
But one of the things that
my team is working on is,

617
00:35:14,901 --> 00:35:19,901
is in fact to perhaps create sort of a
coalition of a of like minded countries

618
00:35:20,111 --> 00:35:20,431
and,

619
00:35:20,431 --> 00:35:23,800
and a couple of companies
where we actually create a
forum where we can discuss

620
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:28,750
the broad range of topics in relation
to technology and where technology is

621
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:30,680
heading.
So perhaps we,

622
00:35:30,681 --> 00:35:33,790
when we went to have a conversation next
year that will be established and we

623
00:35:33,791 --> 00:35:37,670
can talk a little bit about the vision
and where we see that to hitting. Um,

624
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,110
I think that's about what I can say today.

625
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:42,540
So stay tuned for more
information on that,

626
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:44,580
but it actually talks to the core
what we're trying to achieve.

627
00:35:44,581 --> 00:35:45,690
But that's a Chromos initiative.

628
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:47,370
No, but that's actually
true. You know, it's,

629
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:52,350
it makes it bigger companies easier
too because we are organizations,

630
00:35:52,351 --> 00:35:54,570
right? We have, we're at fault
that everything that happens,

631
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:56,760
it's very top down to try and say,
hey,

632
00:35:56,761 --> 00:35:59,390
there's something really interesting
we need to engage on here.

633
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,440
Sometimes it's hard to
get that bubbled up.

634
00:36:01,441 --> 00:36:05,200
So the bigger you have to be with the
brand and umbrella organizations and we

635
00:36:05,201 --> 00:36:06,460
are engaging with that,
you know,

636
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:12,120
the UN even for us as can be hard to
engage with or even state departments,

637
00:36:12,121 --> 00:36:14,680
which I've tried previously in my job.
Yeah.

638
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:19,800
We tip work very close to the Dana state
of various things. So it's a, it's,

639
00:36:19,801 --> 00:36:23,660
it's, it, that would be a
very good thing. Um, again, I,

640
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,740
I need to refer it back to me listening
to the podcast and all that. I,

641
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:33,630
I, and it's, by the way,
it's called tech promise.

642
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:37,590
You talk and it's an amazing podcast
and you should realia Casper has some

643
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:41,430
fantastic people. He interviews and
they paid him to say that. Yeah,

644
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:44,280
get a little bit,
it's on podcast addict.

645
00:36:44,281 --> 00:36:47,310
You can easily find it on soundcloud
and everything. No, it's, it's great.

646
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:51,000
And on Itunes, right? Yes.
Sorry. Yes. That's okay.

647
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:55,380
It's an open plan. Diversify. So it's
an open platform does, it's all good,

648
00:36:56,370 --> 00:37:00,000
but really a, if you are having any
interest in, in this sort of thing,

649
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:03,330
please get into that. Uh, and
if anybody has any questions,

650
00:37:03,331 --> 00:37:06,810
please like get to the
microphones. Um, but you know,

651
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,890
you always finish with the question
of these talks saying like, Hey,

652
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:16,380
what question should I have
asked you but I didn't?

653
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,390
And what's the answer to that question?

654
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,550
Yeah. You know, it's, it's the
poor man's response where you,

655
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:24,280
you're know that you're not clever
enough to come up with a good question.

656
00:37:24,281 --> 00:37:27,990
So it's a nice way to get people
to, uh, to come up with a,

657
00:37:27,991 --> 00:37:30,090
with some interesting answers,
I think.

658
00:37:30,091 --> 00:37:33,660
I think the question you restaurants
and I sort of indicated a little bit of

659
00:37:33,661 --> 00:37:37,800
reply all it is, what can you do
for us? What can Google do to,

660
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:41,070
to support an initiative
like that? Um, and I'm,

661
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:44,720
and I think what is important
is that we, we, we, uh,

662
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:49,860
experience and we see also publicly a
renewed societal responsibility from the

663
00:37:50,461 --> 00:37:53,670
second story. I'm not doing this all my
Google here, but the industry per se,

664
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:56,640
we need to see a societal responsibility,

665
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:59,880
which is proportional to the kind of
influence you guys have when you look at

666
00:37:59,881 --> 00:38:03,060
the platforms and all the new
technologies that you're rolling out.

667
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,260
We haven't spoken too much
about healthcare, but no,

668
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:08,970
it's a massive investment all also
for, for coming like, like Google.

669
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:13,370
I think there was a commercial
dimension to this and that is, I,

670
00:38:13,371 --> 00:38:15,870
I think we all are,

671
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:20,250
is desperate to see a lot more
responsibility, a lot more engagement,

672
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:25,170
a also a lot more creativity in finding,
you know,

673
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:27,870
answers to some of these
difficult questions. Um,

674
00:38:27,871 --> 00:38:29,430
so I think what you can do for us,

675
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:34,290
which should serve cool own interest or
the industry's own interest is actually

676
00:38:34,291 --> 00:38:37,930
to open the doors and begin becoming
more comfortable with having discussions

677
00:38:37,931 --> 00:38:40,750
with governments. We're not
out there to get you. In fact,

678
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:45,110
we out there to work with you and
a and help each other solve the,

679
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:49,180
what I think are really timely.
I'm incredibly important questions,

680
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:53,570
not least in this day and time and age,
we're talking about democracies.

681
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:56,800
We're talking about human rights issues,
about gender equality,

682
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,040
what's all about the, you know,
inequality at the global scale.

683
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:01,150
These are not small issues.

684
00:39:01,151 --> 00:39:04,300
These are incredibly important issues
regardless of whether you work for

685
00:39:04,301 --> 00:39:07,260
government on the dark side
or whether you work for a,

686
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:10,180
an upcoming year to your industry.
A company like a Google

687
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,790
duly noted. Thank you very
much to sign here. If you

688
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:20,370
have somebody else do that. But
no, I, I it's, it's a, it's,

689
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:25,380
I think everybody is, is, it's always
looking for making collaboration.

690
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:30,660
Um,
the like know Google has a mission,

691
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:34,320
right? And that is making the
world's information. Yeah.

692
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:38,970
How has it helped me here?
Free and universally accessible.

693
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,330
Exactly. Right. Which
really ties in I yes.

694
00:39:42,331 --> 00:39:45,390
You have a test when you're moving to
Google it have to be able to answer this.

695
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:50,640
Yeah. Yeah. That's amazing. Yeah. Now I'm
getting a little flustered in that sense.

696
00:39:50,641 --> 00:39:53,580
Can't even recite the
mission. But anyways, uh,

697
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:57,870
let's start with the questions all the
time we have and let's start with the

698
00:39:58,050 --> 00:40:01,350
right side and microphone. Hi, you
could state your name and then, hi,

699
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,380
I'm Gabriela.
I'm a designer here at Google.

700
00:40:04,381 --> 00:40:08,400
Thank you so much for talking to
us today. Um, so my question is,

701
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,320
I'm from Mexico, um, where the,

702
00:40:10,321 --> 00:40:13,140
where the idea of the government
knowing everything about Usaa is bad,

703
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:15,420
just you don't want that.
So I'm curious,

704
00:40:15,421 --> 00:40:19,380
how did you achieve this like 90% of
your interactions with citizens being

705
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:22,080
digital.
Is there a lot of infrastructure?

706
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:24,690
Like do people have computers at home,

707
00:40:24,691 --> 00:40:27,600
do they all have in or did they
have that kind of Internet literacy?

708
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,820
And the second one is,

709
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:33,750
did you have to persuade them at
all or do they just trust you?

710
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:39,190
Yeah, a really good question. Um,
and, and thanks for posting it.

711
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:44,440
We, we're not letting me put
it this way. You of course,

712
00:40:44,441 --> 00:40:47,530
like noticed that it's much easier to
implement systems like that when you have

713
00:40:47,531 --> 00:40:52,150
a small homogenous country like Denmark
where the distances are relatively small

714
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:57,650
and where we already have a high
degree of, of digitalization. But,

715
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:00,490
but if I'm going to save a
little bit black and white,

716
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:05,320
one of the reasons I think we have such
a high degree of penetration of digital

717
00:41:05,321 --> 00:41:07,870
solutions is in fact,
because we didn't ask the population,

718
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,600
this was something which
was implemented gradually,

719
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:14,770
initially primarily out of efficiency
reasons. We wanted it to, you know,

720
00:41:14,771 --> 00:41:18,320
save resources, be more, get
more bang for the buck in,

721
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:22,750
in our communications and all service
delivery to, to people and going pitch it.

722
00:41:22,751 --> 00:41:25,450
So it was certainly part of the,
of that iteration.

723
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:28,960
I think that discussion has changed
today where it's much more about quality,

724
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:34,190
not so not only about the efficiency,
but the honest answer is it was crafted,

725
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:34,760
introduced.

726
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:39,010
And the interesting thing was that the
public sector took the lead this one time,

727
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:42,140
just not something that came from
the private sector. Um, you know,

728
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:45,830
the public sites or took the lead.
It was not incredibly popular,

729
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:49,250
Nita and the private sector to begin with,
but people got used to it.

730
00:41:49,251 --> 00:41:52,940
And today it's actually a competitive
advantage because these companies are used

731
00:41:52,941 --> 00:41:56,780
to this. Uh, they've been
doing it for, for forever. Um,

732
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:58,190
but also the people are used to it.

733
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:02,300
And actually one thing which might be
shocking if you live in the u s is on

734
00:42:02,301 --> 00:42:02,870
average,

735
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:07,870
it takes a day in 15 minutes to do the
text report or the annual tax report,

736
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:11,090
15 minutes, because everything
is provided. The digitally,

737
00:42:11,091 --> 00:42:14,180
you just go in and your chick, uh,
you know, the numbers are they,

738
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:15,350
do they look okay?

739
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,430
Most people go to the end and see are we
getting money back or do we need to pay

740
00:42:19,431 --> 00:42:23,840
some money? Eh, but that's some of the
advantages and people enjoy that. Um, so,

741
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:26,150
so I think the popularity is a,
is certainly there.

742
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,010
And so the second question was,

743
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,400
oh, did you have to, I guess you
kind of already asked me, like,

744
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:33,960
did you have to actually
persuade them to get on board?

745
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:37,140
But I think you said that you
kind of implemented it gradually.

746
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:42,020
Yeah, we, we did. Um, but, but of course,
as I said, what, what I think we had,

747
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:45,590
we had to pay attention to was to
make sure everybody was on board.

748
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:50,050
So there is an analog way of,
of replying to a,

749
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:53,540
to government questions or to interact
with the government because of course not

750
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:54,710
everybody is online.

751
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,430
And I think that's the important big
that you have sort of a safety net around

752
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:02,720
those that are not online. But the,
the direction is, is crystal clear.

753
00:43:02,721 --> 00:43:05,270
We want to have everybody on
board and I think with the,

754
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,520
with the next generation coming on board,

755
00:43:07,521 --> 00:43:12,370
that will be even more natural than
it than it is today. Um, but again,

756
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:15,510
it is easier than a country like Denmark
and they might be in a big country like

757
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:16,463
Mexico.

758
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:18,030
Thank you so much.
Yeah.

759
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:25,470
Hi. Thank You Excellency. My name is
[inaudible] and welcome to Google. Um,

760
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:27,000
I'm an Lsu.
Uh,

761
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:29,980
I'm also a fellow Dane and I'm going to
preface my first question was saying I

762
00:43:29,981 --> 00:43:31,300
used to work at your organization.

763
00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:34,810
I have since switched your nice dress
shoes with this very comfortable sneakers,

764
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,100
condolences about your experience before.

765
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:42,230
Oh, thank you. So my first question
is on a foreign relations in general.

766
00:43:42,231 --> 00:43:46,040
So Google is pretty good at making
decisions based on data and informing our

767
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:49,430
product development. How do you see that
informing foreign relations, for example,

768
00:43:49,431 --> 00:43:51,980
in your own organization?
Are we sinking in more data to,

769
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:53,420
to make informed decisions?

770
00:43:53,421 --> 00:43:57,440
And the second question is more on the
monopolistic nature of a lot of these

771
00:43:57,441 --> 00:44:01,100
companies in the [inaudible] economy
and regulation of the same. Um,

772
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:04,280
so a lot of the innovation that Google
is doing is often when we go into the

773
00:44:04,281 --> 00:44:07,970
marketplace and say, actually
we can do better. So take
for example, Google chrome.

774
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:10,790
It might be several, uh,
recently flat, but and,

775
00:44:10,791 --> 00:44:13,520
or Google fiber where Google decided
to go out and challenge some of the

776
00:44:13,521 --> 00:44:15,740
comments of the market.
Uh,

777
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:19,490
how do you avoid regulating some of
that innovation that also come from big

778
00:44:19,491 --> 00:44:22,160
companies? And when you do that, once
you start to meddle in the market,

779
00:44:22,161 --> 00:44:24,260
how do you avoid that?
For example saying, well,

780
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:27,110
we're going to regulate maybe some of
the American companies and European

781
00:44:27,111 --> 00:44:31,920
companies, but maybe, uh, the Alibabas and
10 cents of the world, we then go in and,

782
00:44:31,921 --> 00:44:34,650
and, and uh, get a bigger share
of that market. Yeah. Yeah.

783
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:37,360
So super good questions.
Um, one, the first one,

784
00:44:37,361 --> 00:44:40,000
how do we use daytime informed policy?
Well,

785
00:44:40,001 --> 00:44:43,900
I think we don't use it enough and part
of my mandate together with my team is

786
00:44:43,901 --> 00:44:48,190
also too to help sort of
change the mindset inside the,

787
00:44:48,191 --> 00:44:51,100
the government or inside the foreign
ministry in a more digital direction.

788
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,440
What does that mean in
practice? It means, for example,

789
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:57,030
that when we look at our development
corporation with Africa, with Aisha, we,

790
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:01,650
we also taking our a firm view on whether
we're doing the right stuff. You know,

791
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:03,490
is it,
is it good to focus on,

792
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:07,750
on a delivery of water in Tanzania and
Kenya or should be in fact look at the

793
00:45:07,751 --> 00:45:11,920
infrastructure and building the right
competencies for people so they can again

794
00:45:11,921 --> 00:45:16,510
reap the benefits of a, of the digital
age. That's one area to look at it.

795
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,100
The other,
the other areas of course,

796
00:45:18,101 --> 00:45:21,550
to see whether we as a delivery
mechanism can use data in a,

797
00:45:21,551 --> 00:45:26,440
in a better way inside the
foreign ministry. And, and
last year we have, sorry,

798
00:45:26,441 --> 00:45:31,030
I have to to um, Nima a rival
company, but as a u s rival company,

799
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:31,960
we,

800
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:36,850
we supported a collaboration between
the Danish Refugee Council and IBM.

801
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:42,160
And that partnership was about
using data on migration flows. The,

802
00:45:42,161 --> 00:45:45,160
first of all, it's a better predict, you
know, in Europe where people coming from,

803
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:48,290
what are the reasons why people are
migrating. But there's also too,

804
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:51,730
to help deliver better humanitarian
efforts. So in other words,

805
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:55,120
people in your extremely difficult
conditions in dire needs,

806
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:59,650
how do we get the right kind of assistance
to them so we don't send out the

807
00:45:59,651 --> 00:46:00,880
wrong stuff they do or don't need.

808
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:05,230
And I think data is going to be creating
a small revolution in how we deliver

809
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:09,610
those kinds of services. So we get more
bang for the buck. So efficiency again,

810
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:11,730
but actually also make
a bigger difference for,

811
00:46:11,731 --> 00:46:13,810
for the people on the receiving end.

812
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:16,360
So I think data will play an
incredibly important role.

813
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:19,300
But as with any other organization,

814
00:46:19,301 --> 00:46:23,350
it takes a little while to get the
mindset going in that direction. But,

815
00:46:23,351 --> 00:46:27,520
but that's part of what we're trying to,
to help with on the other,

816
00:46:27,521 --> 00:46:29,230
on the other issue, um, you know,

817
00:46:29,231 --> 00:46:32,770
I think your 0.2 to one thing which
we're still struggling with in Europe and

818
00:46:32,771 --> 00:46:36,880
that is how do we support innovation? How
do we make sure that we don't regulate,

819
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:39,520
uh,
technologies in a way that actually will,

820
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:42,790
we'll be shooting ourselves
in the foot in the long term.

821
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:47,500
There is a lot of focus on
antitrust and competition. Man,

822
00:46:47,501 --> 00:46:51,180
I'll be honest with you to share that.
You know, when I, when I moved to,

823
00:46:51,181 --> 00:46:55,300
to the u s last year, um, and when I went
to the headquarters in Silicon Valley,

824
00:46:55,301 --> 00:46:58,690
one of the first question was
always, you're Danish? I said, yeah,

825
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:03,490
isn't the EEU Commissioner
for competition? Isn't she
dangerous as well? And said,

826
00:47:03,491 --> 00:47:06,100
yeah. And they said, you know,
how, how does that work together?

827
00:47:06,101 --> 00:47:10,120
Because you just said this is a,
a tech positive environment. Um,

828
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:13,180
but I think permission and I told
commissioner of SDR myself, so again,

829
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,320
I can tell there's honesty.

830
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:18,590
The interesting thing is just under
12 months we've been underground. Um,

831
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:22,060
I think there has been a convergence
of view across the Atlantic on some of

832
00:47:22,061 --> 00:47:25,840
these issues where there is a recognition
that regulation is not only a bad

833
00:47:25,841 --> 00:47:30,610
thing as long as we do it in the right
areas and then leave the other areas

834
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:33,600
alone. Um, so I think if you
look at commission investor, she,

835
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:37,450
she's gone from suddenly being persona
on Carta and certain parts of silicon

836
00:47:37,451 --> 00:47:41,260
valley or the bay area to become a
little bit of a rockstar. And you know,

837
00:47:41,261 --> 00:47:44,530
things are changing when the venture
capitalists are saying, well,

838
00:47:44,531 --> 00:47:47,980
perhaps we need to take a
look on recommendation and
we need to invest more in

839
00:47:47,981 --> 00:47:51,940
companies that have a bigger
social corporate responsibility,

840
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:54,790
then things are changing.
I think that's a positive thing.

841
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:57,510
And I think that will actually also built,
you know,

842
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:01,660
a better companies and Mocha
commercially sustainable companies. But,

843
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,600
but I think the jury is still out on
how we get it right in, in Europe.

844
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,210
And we can't fix that as a small country.

845
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:11,230
But I would argue not to be too focused
on my own country that we punch above

846
00:48:11,231 --> 00:48:14,310
our weight on these issues simply
because we have, you know, the,

847
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:17,170
the degree of digitalization and we have,
you know,

848
00:48:17,171 --> 00:48:18,790
a positive approach to technology.

849
00:48:18,791 --> 00:48:22,150
So we can hopefully also help make
sure that you're a moose in the right

850
00:48:22,151 --> 00:48:24,820
direction on some visits,
difficult questions. But again,

851
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:27,910
we need the industry to help us to
find what the right direction is.

852
00:48:27,911 --> 00:48:31,810
So that's why we are, we're inviting
everybody to, for, uh, for longterm dance.

853
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:36,070
Thank you. Um, and we
have a question over here.

854
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,010
Sure. Appreciate it. Thank you for
coming and speaking to us today. Um,

855
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:42,420
as a veteran myself of
a similar organization,

856
00:48:42,421 --> 00:48:45,260
I was a worked at the US government or us,
um,

857
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:48,580
you govern an it office while
I was getting started up. Um,

858
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,690
I have a great appreciation for the
opportunity and the challenges you have in

859
00:48:51,691 --> 00:48:53,640
front of you. And you sort of
answered this a little bit,

860
00:48:53,641 --> 00:48:57,750
but as you speak about the breadth of
what you're doing in the per view of it,

861
00:48:57,990 --> 00:49:01,710
I'd imagine there are probably some legacy
pieces of the Danish government that

862
00:49:01,711 --> 00:49:03,960
may not want you meddling
in their business.

863
00:49:03,961 --> 00:49:08,790
And how have you been able to get the
opportunity with them to create the

864
00:49:08,791 --> 00:49:11,820
influence you need to sort of enact
these things back on home ground?

865
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:14,390
Yeah,
that's evident be an insight.

866
00:49:14,391 --> 00:49:17,270
Has a question and you know
how difficult it is to yeah.

867
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,800
Bureaucracies to tumor when the right
duration. Well, the interesting thing is,

868
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:23,650
you know,
I come from the foreign ministry,

869
00:49:23,651 --> 00:49:27,370
but I would actually argue that we work
as much on the domestic agenda as we do

870
00:49:27,371 --> 00:49:31,150
on the foreign policy agenda. Um, there
are numerous activities back home,

871
00:49:31,151 --> 00:49:34,750
which is about preparing Denmark for four,
the fourth industrial revolution.

872
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:38,200
And one of the things that we're doing
is actually linking up with a lot of the

873
00:49:38,201 --> 00:49:41,030
ministries back home or at
the authorities where the,

874
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:44,590
whether it's the ministry for Philipa or
the Ministry for transportation or the

875
00:49:44,591 --> 00:49:45,850
Ministry for health care.

876
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:50,950
And the thing we're doing with them is
it's both to be sort of a Ford operating

877
00:49:50,951 --> 00:49:54,310
posts in the epicenter of new technology.

878
00:49:54,311 --> 00:49:57,760
So basically being out there collecting
information during small analysis,

879
00:49:58,190 --> 00:50:02,290
you know, telling a colleagues back
home, you better be aware that, you know,

880
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:06,310
Google is looking at the retina scanning
for diabetes patients. You know,

881
00:50:06,311 --> 00:50:11,140
that that will have an impact also on
the way we treat, uh, patients back home.

882
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:14,490
How do we propel our health care systems
for that kind of new technologies

883
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:18,280
coming? Yeah. A theater, the
attorney. So very soon. So,

884
00:50:18,281 --> 00:50:21,280
so being that sort of beacon out there,
bringing information back home,

885
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:25,960
I think face an incredibly important part
in both changing the mindset back home,

886
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:29,450
but in fact also in a very practical
way help look at, you know,

887
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:34,430
is all legislation prepared for those
opportunities or the areas where we want

888
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:34,931
to work with,

889
00:50:34,931 --> 00:50:38,600
with Google or other companies to make
sure that when you do healthcare or when

890
00:50:38,601 --> 00:50:41,810
you do education that we,
that we get it right.

891
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:45,450
So it also fits together
with, with our approach. Um,

892
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,390
I don't know whether you know this,

893
00:50:47,410 --> 00:50:51,450
but Uber was introduced in Denmark and
then it was a band, uh, I think, uh,

894
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:53,970
more or less a year after
its introduction, uh, for,

895
00:50:53,971 --> 00:50:58,300
for a number of different reasons and
eloquent to say that, that my office had,

896
00:50:58,301 --> 00:51:01,850
had been in existence a five years ago,
that it would have fixed everything.

897
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:05,900
What I would argue though is that I think
Uber is a pretty good example of a new

898
00:51:05,901 --> 00:51:10,901
technology or new platform coming into
Europe coming into Denmark where have,

899
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:14,450
had we had a tech ambassador
or my office a few years ago,

900
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,790
we could have identified that and said,
well,

901
00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:20,720
let's work with the Ministry
of Transportation back
home or the appropriate

902
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:25,550
authorities and see what we can do. Uh,
what are the, what are the fine lines,

903
00:51:25,551 --> 00:51:26,930
what are the red lines for Denmark?

904
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:30,170
And then have a dialogue
with a headquarters over
here to make sure there's not

905
00:51:30,171 --> 00:51:31,250
introduced in the wrong way.

906
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:33,950
And I think that should be
an interest of the companies,

907
00:51:33,951 --> 00:51:37,520
but it's certainly also in the
interest of the, of a country our size.

908
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:42,250
Did you notice how I avoided
answering exactly how I know,

909
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:46,260
good positive answer to I'm sure
other existing challenge to thank you.

910
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:48,830
No, but to be honest with
you, it's not always easy,

911
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:53,780
but I think in any organization or
any, any big industry, you know,

912
00:51:53,781 --> 00:51:56,150
there's always resistance when
you're trying to things in,

913
00:51:56,151 --> 00:51:59,930
in a new way that we've experienced
that. But I think, I think the,

914
00:51:59,931 --> 00:52:04,730
the goal is so important that we get
this right. Um, that, uh, you know,

915
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:06,170
eventually it will,

916
00:52:06,171 --> 00:52:10,280
it will cause a lot of changes both in
mindsets and also how we do business. And,

917
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:12,980
and we've seen this just under
12 months within the underway.

918
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:15,870
I want to make sure we get
through all our questions. Sure.

919
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:18,910
People aren't lining up.
So over here,

920
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:24,580
hi, my name's Jimmy. Uh, I'm a former
Googler and my question is, um, you know,

921
00:52:24,581 --> 00:52:28,480
anyone who's been paying attention to
the news has seen there's like increasing

922
00:52:28,481 --> 00:52:33,460
evidence that Russia, for example,
is using technology platforms,

923
00:52:33,461 --> 00:52:38,050
whether it's Twitter or Facebook
advertising platforms to try to influence

924
00:52:38,051 --> 00:52:39,880
democracies.
Um,

925
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:44,320
do you see that these sorts of
geopolitical conflicts have a risk of

926
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:48,820
increasingly spilling over
into tech? And, uh, what would,

927
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:52,820
uh, you know, what's
your expectation or, um,

928
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:57,490
the Danish foreign ministries expectation
for Google and other tech companies

929
00:52:57,491 --> 00:52:58,001
role?
You know,

930
00:52:58,001 --> 00:53:02,590
is it as a neutral arbiter or would you
expect them to take proactive measures

931
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:04,030
and these sorts of conflicts?

932
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,230
Yeah, got that question. Super
quick question. And, and it,

933
00:53:08,231 --> 00:53:09,970
it enables me to say that I think

934
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:15,430
we realized that cyber
issues, uh, is, is, uh,

935
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:17,740
is not something that will go away.
In fact,

936
00:53:17,741 --> 00:53:19,840
it might increase over the
next couple of years. Also,

937
00:53:19,841 --> 00:53:24,570
as we digitalize more and more parts of
our societies. And, and of course we are,

938
00:53:24,730 --> 00:53:27,010
you know,
Mike government has set this repeating,

939
00:53:27,011 --> 00:53:30,260
we're extremely concerned about
the way Russia is operating in,

940
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:33,500
in the cyber security
arena. And we need, uh,

941
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:35,760
to have better defensive mechanisms,

942
00:53:35,761 --> 00:53:39,120
but we also need international
collaboration to try and
sort of mitigate these

943
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:43,470
issues. These are not small, um,
you know, destructive incident.

944
00:53:43,471 --> 00:53:45,680
This is about potentially metalink with,
uh,

945
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:50,760
with elections or undermining
public confidence in institutions,

946
00:53:50,761 --> 00:53:53,610
et cetera. So these are relationships
that we'd take extremely seriously.

947
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:58,520
We need an international collaboration.
Um, also to make sure that,

948
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:01,080
that those maligned actors that are
actually performing these things,

949
00:54:01,081 --> 00:54:03,500
that they are brought out in the open and,

950
00:54:03,501 --> 00:54:07,350
and in in the right circumstances
that we have attribution in that case.

951
00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:10,560
But we also, and that's to answer
the last part of your question.

952
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:14,940
We certainly expect the industry to take
a responsibility in this area and we

953
00:54:14,941 --> 00:54:18,060
know it's incredibly complex
and if there is a, you know,

954
00:54:18,061 --> 00:54:23,061
a very fine line between a meddling with
the freedom of speech and freedom of

955
00:54:23,251 --> 00:54:28,251
expression and then of course removing
content that you identify positively as

956
00:54:28,411 --> 00:54:30,630
being a,
you're not truthful or,

957
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:34,450
or basically a based on
so it doesn't exist. Um,

958
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:39,490
and I think that that dilemma is
going to be be important to try and,

959
00:54:39,491 --> 00:54:42,170
and find the silver bullet for,
it's not good to be said,

960
00:54:42,171 --> 00:54:45,960
but we're going to put a lot of the
efforts into it and we expect and we are

961
00:54:45,961 --> 00:54:48,930
going to work very hard to make sure
that the industry also plays a part.

962
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:53,100
It's part. Thank you. So
we are at time, however,

963
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:57,570
I would like to if possible, and I get
an okay from the control room back there,

964
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:02,550
um, to, um, to get the last few
questions for. So over here.

965
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:08,450
Hi, I'm Kira and I actually just
joined a Google New York from Google,

966
00:55:08,451 --> 00:55:13,310
Denmark. So I have Lyft and works in
Denmark for about year and a half.

967
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:18,140
And in the last 10 years that was the
10th country in which I lived and work.

968
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:18,810
Uh,

969
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:23,810
so what I see is that there's actually
this growing population of people who,

970
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:28,010
you know, they might not be just digital
nomads, but obviously that's, you know,

971
00:55:28,011 --> 00:55:31,460
part of the group as well,
uh, who are kind of, you know,

972
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:35,060
in different countries and obviously
they're experiencing the digitalization

973
00:55:35,061 --> 00:55:37,260
level in different countries differently.
Uh,

974
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:41,150
and what I noticed this is that actually
no country that I've lived and work in,

975
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:45,620
they really think in any way about
people like that who actually have their

976
00:55:45,621 --> 00:55:49,850
presence beyond the country. So I know
that officer Denmark has done a lot,

977
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:53,270
and with like Estonia with, they're
like east citizenships, you know,

978
00:55:53,271 --> 00:55:57,110
they're looking at that as well. Uh, but
I have kind of a two fold question. Like,

979
00:55:57,111 --> 00:55:58,040
could you share and you know,

980
00:55:58,070 --> 00:56:02,660
is this part of a discussion where
people are becoming more globalized and

981
00:56:02,661 --> 00:56:06,090
they're not really looking at
any single one country, uh,

982
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:10,340
as like the source of truth of their
identity or of their digital identity?

983
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:14,180
And number two, you know, do you
feel that you, in your position,

984
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:18,560
can you actually do something about that
or are you having these discussions in

985
00:56:18,561 --> 00:56:19,820
your circles as well?

986
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:24,010
Oh, enormously difficult. A question. Um,

987
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:27,310
what I would say is that
I think you represent, uh,

988
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:30,990
a group which is growing in
numbers. So these years, um,

989
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:34,840
I think if you look at it from a,
from a country point of view, uh,

990
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:38,410
what there is renewed focus on is that
we need people like you with skills and

991
00:56:38,411 --> 00:56:39,990
competencies to help,
you know,

992
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:43,600
drive the economy and built
the new technology companies.

993
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:47,140
And I can tell you very honestly that
I haven't met a single Dane is tech

994
00:56:47,141 --> 00:56:51,010
company wares and said, well, we're
in desperate need for, you know,

995
00:56:51,011 --> 00:56:55,030
skills and competencies that are very
difficult to find even in Europe or in

996
00:56:55,031 --> 00:56:59,230
Copenhagen or wherever it might
be. Stockholm is throwing.
Yeah. Um, so on so forth.

997
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:02,140
So I think a lot of focus we'll,
we'll go into,

998
00:57:02,141 --> 00:57:06,490
into that direction both to make sure
we educate a new generation that has the

999
00:57:06,491 --> 00:57:09,160
right skill sets to,
to work in a digital world,

1000
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:13,900
but also to make sure that we can attract
the kind of competencies that we need

1001
00:57:13,901 --> 00:57:16,660
for, for the companies. The problem is
of course it's a global competition.

1002
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:19,210
You know, when you sit
in, in Silicon Valley,

1003
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,340
I don't think I met any
company where they said, well,

1004
00:57:21,341 --> 00:57:23,330
it's damn difficult to find,
you know,

1005
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:26,470
the right engineers or the software
engineers that, that we need.

1006
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:28,450
The competition is fierce.

1007
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:31,360
And I think that competition will
become increasingly a global.

1008
00:57:31,361 --> 00:57:34,330
So we also need global solutions to,
to those aspects.

1009
00:57:34,790 --> 00:57:37,390
Whether I can do anything
in that dimension. Well,

1010
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:40,900
I think what we can do is to bring back
information and knowledge that these are

1011
00:57:40,901 --> 00:57:44,140
discussions that are taking
place or some on the, you know,

1012
00:57:44,141 --> 00:57:48,050
the next generation of tech savvy
people that we would like to,

1013
00:57:48,051 --> 00:57:50,740
to attract to Denmark. Um, we,

1014
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:54,240
we can't offer any good weather
and Denmark, but you know,

1015
00:57:54,310 --> 00:57:57,550
the city is not too bad and you can
bike around to everywhere. So there are,

1016
00:57:57,810 --> 00:57:58,601
there are pros and cons.

1017
00:57:58,601 --> 00:58:01,750
So perhaps we need to be better at
branding their mark or so because of the

1018
00:58:01,751 --> 00:58:04,090
weather, but because of the
quality of life as well.

1019
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:09,390
And that's where he can pay me back
money if which page, then capital.

1020
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:13,860
All right. I know we're way over time,
but last question from over here.

1021
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:19,540
Uh, hi, my name is Tim. I'm
a software engineer here. Um,
my question is, uh, you know,

1022
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:22,280
traditionally when new
technologies came into space,

1023
00:58:22,281 --> 00:58:25,490
we generally didn't have an investor,
right? We didn't have an investor,

1024
00:58:25,491 --> 00:58:28,970
JC standard oil. Um, and, uh, you know,

1025
00:58:29,570 --> 00:58:34,320
traditionally when you want to do get
access to technology or to skillset,

1026
00:58:34,430 --> 00:58:39,110
you would usually work with the State
Department or whatnot of whatever country.

1027
00:58:39,111 --> 00:58:43,070
And through that you'd create
economic, you know, deals or whatnot.

1028
00:58:43,610 --> 00:58:48,410
And so, and that's been the case
I guess until now to some extent.

1029
00:58:48,411 --> 00:58:53,080
So another way of asking
the same question as um, uh,

1030
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:58,170
like what's, uh, I understand the
initiative of trying to, you know,

1031
00:58:58,370 --> 00:59:03,080
outreach to the tech industry, but
can you give me an idea of, of like a,

1032
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:05,360
what's the urgency coming
from to some extent?

1033
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:06,503
Yeah,

1034
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:11,580
really a relevant question and
perhaps I can begin by giving a,

1035
00:59:11,630 --> 00:59:15,030
give you a example of the kind of
critique that we've been faced with a the

1036
00:59:15,031 --> 00:59:18,540
first year. Um, it's, it's quite
often that we are being asked,

1037
00:59:18,541 --> 00:59:23,300
so are you now putting companies before
countries? So in other words, is this,

1038
00:59:23,301 --> 00:59:26,920
you know, elevating Google tour a defect
or a state without having, you know,

1039
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:30,740
democracies below it and all of
that. And, and my reply to that,

1040
00:59:30,741 --> 00:59:32,260
or I'll reply to that is always,

1041
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:37,010
well this is in fact about trying to
protect the role of states in the future

1042
00:59:37,011 --> 00:59:40,010
governance because I think governance
is going to come under a lot of threat

1043
00:59:40,430 --> 00:59:41,181
there or a face,

1044
00:59:41,181 --> 00:59:44,180
a lot of challenges because of the kind
of platforms that you guys are building

1045
00:59:44,181 --> 00:59:47,360
and rolling out. It doesn't
respect the national border assess.

1046
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:51,740
Perhaps some of the older
industries would. But I think
the real, you know, the,

1047
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:55,400
the pertinent part of your question is
why is it different now than it was,

1048
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:59,540
you know, 50 years ago when the
oil industry began to roll out.

1049
00:59:59,970 --> 01:00:03,390
And that I think is because of the
piece. So, so I do think that, you know,

1050
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:04,670
I don't want to call it an exponential,

1051
01:00:04,671 --> 01:00:08,600
but I think what we're
seeing is incredibly fast
pace of the new platforms we

1052
01:00:08,601 --> 01:00:11,120
rolled out. The way that, uh,

1053
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:15,650
the technology basically penetrates
everything we do, all sectors. Uh,

1054
01:00:15,830 --> 01:00:18,190
it doesn't matter whether you're in
construction or whether you're in health

1055
01:00:18,191 --> 01:00:22,970
care technology is going to be a game
changer potentially within a very short

1056
01:00:22,971 --> 01:00:23,804
time span.

1057
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:28,100
So I think that's the reason why we
think time is ripe and it is something

1058
01:00:28,101 --> 01:00:32,000
different than, than oil. Uh, I
think data is not a finite resource,

1059
01:00:32,001 --> 01:00:36,110
so you'll continue to sort of expand
and build on that and it gives enormous

1060
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:37,610
opportunities.
Um,

1061
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:42,290
edit might also challenge our country
like Denmark or the European Union or the

1062
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:45,770
United Nations in a more profound way
than what we've seen with some previous

1063
01:00:45,771 --> 01:00:49,910
technologies. So, so that's at least our
argumentation that this is different.

1064
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:52,660
It feels different,
and therefore we need a different,

1065
01:00:52,661 --> 01:00:57,540
a reply or response to that. And that
reply or response in our case, uh, is,

1066
01:00:57,550 --> 01:01:00,620
is part of [inaudible] is here to do.

1067
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:06,260
Okay. Well, thank you. Thank you.

1068
01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:08,980
Thank you everybody. Uh, if
you could give her a hand,

1069
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:10,410
Casper.
