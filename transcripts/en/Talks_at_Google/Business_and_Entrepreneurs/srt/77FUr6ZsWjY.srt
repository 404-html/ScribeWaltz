1
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,700
Good afternoon. My name
is Amin huck. And uh,

2
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:16,500
when I was growing up, when I
was young, when I was in school,

3
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,770
I used to stammer quite a bit.
I would stammer,

4
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,730
I would stutter and uh,

5
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,450
I would trail off mid sentence.
I will not finish off my sentences.

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,050
I realize I'm not the only one who does
that. There are quite a few who do that.

7
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,540
Uh, but it took me some
fine too. You know,

8
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:37,980
took some time to find that
reassurance that I'm not the only one.

9
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:42,840
Uh, so when I was growing up,
I used to stay a lot at home.

10
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,360
I was a little shy.
I was a little result.

11
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:49,170
I would not go out and play with
other kids as much as I'd like to.

12
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:57,730
And what do you do when you stay at home
and spend more time at home than most

13
00:00:58,131 --> 00:01:01,730
people do?
I remember two things very distinctly.

14
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:06,230
We used to talk a lot,
real conversations,

15
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,850
but talk a lot.

16
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:09,330
Yeah,

17
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,580
we do that sometimes when
we don't have electricity,

18
00:01:11,581 --> 00:01:14,490
but we don't have that comfort anymore.
Power backup kicks in

19
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,600
when we used to talk a
lot about everything.

20
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,040
The second thing I used to do a lot was
that I used to read a lot and I used to

21
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:27,060
lead, uh, uh, a lot of
stories, not math or science.

22
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,770
I may have been somewhere else if I was
reading math or science. Uh, but I'm,

23
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,950
I'm over indexed on stories,
uh,

24
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,160
the same stories that you read, but
you know, I could win a quiz on,

25
00:01:38,161 --> 00:01:40,080
in regil comics and down

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,070
and it was a bigger fan of
in the Gel comics then how
much, it's like a terrible,

27
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,630
I started off within the Gel comics and
the usual stories that we all grew up on.

28
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:54,000
[inaudible] Janda, Mama, Amr,
cheese, terracotta, and uh,

29
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,940
there is a hierarchy that
we all follow, don't we? Uh,

30
00:01:56,941 --> 00:01:59,190
if you've grown up in India
at a particular point of time,

31
00:01:59,191 --> 00:02:00,630
most of us follow that hierarchy.

32
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,260
You move on from these stories
too famous by even secret seven.

33
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:08,400
And then from famous five
and secret seven, you'll move
onto hardy boys and Nancy

34
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:09,403
juice.

35
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:16,050
Nancy Drews let's clap for my
friend. You know, there are a few men

36
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,790
[inaudible]

37
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,720
there are very few men who have the
courage to add and a large gathering that

38
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:26,040
they've read some Nancy Drews.

39
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,820
I read some Wilson Boon as well.

40
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,543
Okay,

41
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,990
let's clap for my friend here.

42
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,350
And I totally enjoyed reading the,
the few that I did.

43
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:50,590
And then I moved on to Westerns Louis
L'amour the callback classics and by Grade

44
00:02:51,651 --> 00:02:54,390
Seventh, you know, uh,
I remember in grade 17,

45
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,680
I was in Kansas with La and uh,

46
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:01,060
in Kansas Medallia we had recommended
reading as part of recommended reading.

47
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:04,810
Another trick with recommended reading
is that it's not part of curriculum,

48
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,860
it's not part of syllabus.

49
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,550
Nobody's going to ask you
questions in exams based on that.

50
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,230
So as we say in Hindi,
there is a phrase up Kesha de [inaudible],

51
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,540
which basically means
read it if you'd like. Uh,

52
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,740
but I was reading Ramayana and this
was not a much to Catherine minor.

53
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:24,310
This was proper Rama and this was
take Romano in difficult Hindi.

54
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,560
And in grade eight recommended reading
was the Mahabharata and I was reading the

55
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,410
Maha Martha, which had my mom freaking
out and terribly worried about me.

56
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:38,500
Normal kids don't do that. So all of
deep concern and out of anxiety for me,

57
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:42,460
she enrolled me into speech therapy,
into elocution, into debate competitions,

58
00:03:42,461 --> 00:03:44,440
into poetry,
the citation into the drama club,

59
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,840
like comprehensive
damage control strategy.

60
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,700
I am really grateful to her for that.

61
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,530
I'm very grateful to her for that because
all of these things together helped me

62
00:03:56,531 --> 00:03:59,170
a lot.
And out of all of these things,

63
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:02,920
I fell in love with theater and I
wanted to do nothing but theater.

64
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,510
I wrote my first play and it was a copy,

65
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:13,270
I must admit. Uh, but I wrote my
first play when I was in grade ninth.

66
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:18,160
I directed it, I directed my friends
and I participated in it as well.

67
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,970
Uh, and if some of you, I
can see the expressions, wow,

68
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:26,020
that seems like an early start. If
there's anything that describes that play,

69
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,330
a pathetic might be an understatement.

70
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,850
And there are many people who are
walking this planet still scarred by that

71
00:04:33,851 --> 00:04:38,200
experience. But you know how good
teachers are. My teachers are fantastic.

72
00:04:38,201 --> 00:04:41,260
They said, I mean, what you're
doing is wonderful. Do more.

73
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:46,270
They had no idea that I would take up
their advice seriously and they will have

74
00:04:46,271 --> 00:04:48,830
to suffer a lot after that.
But I,

75
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:52,810
I continue doing more and
I did much more in, uh,

76
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,760
in high school. I did much more
theater in college than most kids do.

77
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,440
And that's what I really wanted to do.

78
00:04:59,441 --> 00:05:02,110
But you know how it is growing
up in middle class India,

79
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,930
you don't choose extra
curricular activities.

80
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:09,910
At least that's how it was when I was
growing up. Uh, and it still is the same.

81
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:14,830
We don't choose extracurricular
activities as professional choices.

82
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,900
We choose what our percentage is,

83
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:19,350
allow us to do and there's a
strict hierarchy there. Uh,

84
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,430
so to cut a long story short,
I did buy a,

85
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:23,920
did a course in business administration,
worked in sales,

86
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:28,150
and then I got lucky to get into one of
the best advertising schools in India at

87
00:05:28,151 --> 00:05:29,920
that point of time and institute.

88
00:05:29,921 --> 00:05:32,740
And I'm the bug and we had
wonderful campus placement.

89
00:05:32,741 --> 00:05:36,700
So one of the world's best advertising
agencies at that point of time.

90
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,980
And even now at this point of time,

91
00:05:38,981 --> 00:05:43,750
Ogilvy and Mather came to campus pick
me up and I moved to boom by advertising

92
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:48,751
Mecca and I started earning my own
salary now that I was making money.

93
00:05:48,911 --> 00:05:51,640
Within a week of moving to Mumbai,
I joined the theater group

94
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:59,640
and these two tracks that I had a
deer track and I had an evening track.

95
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,380
They track advertising,
evening track theater,

96
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:08,270
kind of define my journey over
the next 18 years of my life.

97
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,480
So I moved from advertising to marketing.

98
00:06:11,481 --> 00:06:14,150
I was head of marketing
for Louis Phillippe. Uh,

99
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:16,190
and then I moved from
marketing to consulting,

100
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:20,510
specifically brand strategy consulting,
go to market strategies, uh,

101
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,570
India entry strategy.
How do you increase your market share?

102
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,930
How do you come out to premium
for your brand brand strategy?

103
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,850
Not If these were my day tracks,
my evening tracks, what theater,

104
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,800
poetry as a student of
cinema and as a photographer.

105
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,520
And if there was any one thread that know
if there was a single thread that sort

106
00:06:40,521 --> 00:06:42,050
of know combined or sort of,
you know,

107
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,020
that was common between both
of these tracks of my life.

108
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,940
It was the fact that I was dealing with
stories and narrative in both of them

109
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,790
and working with stories in both
of these, I realize that, you know,

110
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:00,940
we don't leverage stories in our work
as much as we can and we don't leverage

111
00:07:02,151 --> 00:07:07,010
stories in education as much as we
can and with a desire to address that.

112
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:11,720
I plunged into the world of storytelling
as a story coach, as a story consultant.

113
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,410
And what we're going to do today is we're
going to look at business storytelling

114
00:07:15,411 --> 00:07:18,140
specifically, what are the
principles of business storytelling?

115
00:07:18,141 --> 00:07:21,290
How can we tell better stories about
our products if there are a couple of

116
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:24,560
frameworks that we could use and
how to build a bank of stories.

117
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,390
That's what we're going to do. So
let's go straight, uh, into this.

118
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:33,710
You know what I'm going to do is I'm
going to share a, we do have with you now,

119
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,370
it may seem at first glance that this
video has nothing to do with business,

120
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,440
but we will look at it with a business
lens and we will see this from a business

121
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:46,220
lens. Now this guy that you see
here, uh, he has a business issue.

122
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:51,410
He puts out an elevator pitch,
a business message and that doesn't work.

123
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:54,050
And then he gets some
help and magic happens.

124
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,470
We look at that and see what are the
principles we can derive from that.

125
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,860
And I'll walk you through business
storytelling principles that we can derive

126
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:03,260
from this film.
So let's take a look at this film.

127
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:06,933
Okay?

128
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,313
Okay.

129
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:23,660
What did you do to my same,
I've seen

130
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:29,360
different words.
Excellent.

131
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,593
Hmm.

132
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:42,610
No, I'm not an expert on
morality, on ethics of begging.

133
00:09:42,611 --> 00:09:45,040
So we are going to look at
this in a very objective sense.

134
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:48,430
You know this guys in business,
he has an elevator pitch.

135
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:51,820
That pitch doesn't seem to
resonate well with the audiences.

136
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:55,660
They are just passing them by and then
the lady comes and changes the message

137
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,280
and magic happens.

138
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:01,750
What are the principles that we can
derive from this in terms of storytelling?

139
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:07,290
The first one is that stories
speak to people's emotions.

140
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,450
And we know this,
that there are two sides to the brain,

141
00:10:10,451 --> 00:10:11,770
the logical side of the brain,

142
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:16,210
the rational side of the brain and the
feelings and the emotional side of the

143
00:10:16,211 --> 00:10:18,220
brain.
And there are decisions,

144
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:23,280
decision scientists who've been studying
a very important question that all

145
00:10:23,441 --> 00:10:27,970
business leaders want to understand,
oh, this is the question.

146
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,510
How do people decide
when faced with choices,

147
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,080
when faced with alternatives,

148
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:40,110
how do we make a choice and what swings
the decision in favor of a versus B?

149
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,890
If there are two candidates
for they know they are too,

150
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:48,790
too lightly can candidates for the CEO
position, how does the board decide,

151
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:54,040
uh, given both the candidates
look equal? No. From Ivy School,

152
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:57,520
from Ib School, 20 years in
business, 20 years in business,

153
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:00,250
has worked in three geographies,
has worked in three geographies,

154
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:02,280
has worked in three departments,
has worked in freedom.

155
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:07,180
But departments has a wonderful track
record like to like know how does the

156
00:11:07,181 --> 00:11:09,610
board choose between a candidate was as B,

157
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:14,940
how do we choose between Colgate and
Pepsodent and how do we choose between

158
00:11:14,981 --> 00:11:18,880
vendor a was his window be?
How do people decide?

159
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:23,620
And and decision science has revealed
to us that in almost all kinds of

160
00:11:23,621 --> 00:11:28,120
decisions, the emotional side
of the brain is predominant.

161
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,940
And stories speak to emotions.

162
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:35,740
And I'll talk about facts and I'll talk
about numbers and I'll talk about data

163
00:11:35,741 --> 00:11:40,060
and how storytellers leverage that
because you know, it's in this world,

164
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:43,240
uh Oh,
where we have more and more data,

165
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:46,810
it actually makes the rules of stories
even more important because when we are

166
00:11:46,811 --> 00:11:51,040
inundated with data, where we are
inundated with information from all sides,

167
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:56,110
it's even more important that focus on
narrative because narrative helps us make

168
00:11:56,111 --> 00:11:57,670
sense of that data.

169
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:02,860
So speak to people's emotions and when
you speak to people's emotions it gathers

170
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:05,740
and it results in a higher response.

171
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:10,330
But Roi is higher when you
speak to people's emotions.

172
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:15,010
The second one is build common ground.
And uh,

173
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,040
it's interesting that the first word
that has guy used on that poster was I,

174
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,970
that's not a great place
to start your stories.

175
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,180
But if you look around lots of corporate
stories, a lot of organizations, stories,

176
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,870
lot of sales stories start from I,

177
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:36,280
lot of product pitchers start from I,
this is my product, this is my idea,

178
00:12:36,281 --> 00:12:37,330
this is what I have done.

179
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:43,030
I is not a great place to start because
you know, I presumes that you know,

180
00:12:43,031 --> 00:12:46,600
in my, what I'm interested in is something
that you are interested in as well.

181
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:50,890
But she doesn't make that assumption and
she starts by building common ground.

182
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,760
And that common ground here is, it's
a beautiful day. You can see that.

183
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:58,630
And when you see that you are not in
agreement. Yes, it's a beautiful day.

184
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,960
That's magical watch he is doing here
is getting our audience to nod in

185
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,470
agreement. And when your audience
starts nodding in agreement,

186
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,440
you are in a better place
to sell them something.

187
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:16,720
So get your audience nodding in
agreement by building common ground.

188
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:22,230
Next principle and all storytellers use
this either intuitively or consciously,

189
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,060
is build contrast.

190
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:29,710
Contrast is one of the most
powerful devices in storytelling,

191
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:34,510
uh, day and night. Rich
and poor, good versus bad,

192
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:35,830
hero versus villain.

193
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:42,450
It's in the world of contrasts
that story's live and
stories evoke that world of

194
00:13:43,181 --> 00:13:47,450
contrast. Now, when we worked
with new products, what we,

195
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:52,780
we have fertile ground for
contrast because new products
operate in the realm of

196
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,430
what is versus what can be.

197
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:02,080
Now that's a powerful contrast
between waters and what can be.

198
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:07,090
So don't limit yourself to the contrast
of the problem and the solution,

199
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:12,480
which is the typical trap that a lot of
stories fall to see beyond and see what

200
00:14:13,901 --> 00:14:16,390
you can do. Uh, in terms of contrast,

201
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:21,070
in terms of exploring what is possible
today versus what can be possible in

202
00:14:21,071 --> 00:14:25,450
terms of what can be done today versus
what can be done in some ways when we are

203
00:14:25,451 --> 00:14:28,030
building new products,
you're building the new world.

204
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,860
When you're building new products,
you're building a new kind of world,

205
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,720
paint a picture of that world because
what you want to do is not just at a

206
00:14:37,721 --> 00:14:40,480
literal level,
get people to use that product.

207
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:44,290
What you want to do is you are
selling citizenship to a new world,

208
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:47,890
to a new planet,
and you want people to raise hand and say,

209
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,930
we want to be citizens of that world.

210
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:55,200
So paint a picture of that world and
describe that world at contrast with

211
00:14:55,551 --> 00:14:56,384
today's world.

212
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:57,810
Yeah,

213
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:01,110
you that contrast and she
uses that beautifully here.

214
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,700
She uses it beautifully
in an emotional sense.

215
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:11,410
She uses it beautifully when she says,
and she uses it in a positive sense.

216
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,800
This guy was operating from
a place called sympathy,

217
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,760
but she is not operating from sympathy.
She's operating from empathy.

218
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:23,350
That's a powerful position to
operate from. That guy is saying,

219
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:26,920
look at me, you know I am in
a sorry state, please help me.

220
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:31,150
But why she saying is she's,
there's a powerful flip happening here.

221
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,580
She is not saying how bad, look
at me, how bad I am, you know my,

222
00:15:35,581 --> 00:15:37,810
my condition is really bad.
You need to help me.

223
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:43,410
Instead she is saying you have not
paused and life to think about this,

224
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:46,750
but take a moment to think about this.
You have eyes,

225
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,380
you can see that's a powerful flip.

226
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,540
You can see she makes you feel better.

227
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:57,780
And that's the switch that I'm talking
about from sympathy to empathy n and then

228
00:15:59,111 --> 00:16:03,010
she establishes the fact that there was
a big divide between what you can see

229
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:06,220
but icon. And that contrast is, you know,

230
00:16:06,221 --> 00:16:11,080
it's implied in the earlier pitch,
but here it's explicit.

231
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,710
So you need to draw and build on that
contrast. And that's what she does.

232
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,620
It's a very powerful tool of storytelling.
See,

233
00:16:17,621 --> 00:16:20,830
when you are building new products and
telling the story of those new products,

234
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,840
how you can leverage contrast.

235
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,030
And I say this that a beautiful
definition of storytelling for me,

236
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,830
particularly business storytelling,

237
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,360
but in for for all kinds of
storytelling really is truth.

238
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,030
Well told. No, I'm not a
big fan of definitions.

239
00:16:37,031 --> 00:16:39,430
I never was a big fan of
definitions in school,

240
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:43,540
but I like this because there are
two parts, two stories. First,

241
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:48,910
all stories must come from truth because
if they are coming from a place called

242
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:53,140
falsehood, then those two are going
to have a very short shelf life.

243
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:57,580
We've seen that with enough stories
that tried to leverage false hood.

244
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,870
They couldn't go far,

245
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,650
okay?

246
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:04,860
So so far someone has a very
short shelf life in life,

247
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:07,440
but more particularly.
So in business stories,

248
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:11,280
they have to come from a
place called authenticity.
Stories have to be authentic.

249
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:12,390
Stories have to be truthful.

250
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:15,930
They have to be based on fact that they
have to be based on data and that data

251
00:17:15,931 --> 00:17:16,890
has to be truthful.

252
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:18,750
Okay?

253
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:22,620
But as we saw in this example,
truth alone isn't enough.

254
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,540
That guy was telling the truth, I'm
blind, please help. But it doesn't work.

255
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,360
It needs to be stated beautifully.

256
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:35,990
That's why truth has to meet well told
and that well-told is articulation.

257
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:42,930
That well-told his presentation
that well-told is visualization.

258
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:48,080
That well-told his use of metaphor is
use of contrast when will happens to and

259
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,110
and meet Strut. Then it becomes a story
which is why we've seen this in life.

260
00:17:55,410 --> 00:18:00,410
It's not what you say alone that matters
but how we say it that makes all the

261
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:02,214
difference.

262
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:05,970
There are people who've said no to you
and your friendship with them has broken

263
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,820
and there are others who have said no to
you and you're still friends with them

264
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,580
and the differences,
how they said it.

265
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:15,150
There are other like I could give
you another example. There's a,

266
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:19,800
there's a boss you worked with and
during performance appraisal he gave you

267
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:24,860
honest feedback and it was
critical feedback and he
told you the areas that you

268
00:18:25,561 --> 00:18:30,120
were lacking in and you came out crying
and you hated that guy and you never

269
00:18:30,121 --> 00:18:34,560
want to work with that boss ever again.
And under performance appraisal.

270
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:40,220
Another guy shares the same feedback
with you and points out inadequacies,

271
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,490
but does it in a manner
that when you come out,

272
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:48,060
you feel so happy that you want to
work with this guy all your life.

273
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,890
It's not what you say,

274
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:54,570
but how you say it that
makes all the difference. So,

275
00:18:54,571 --> 00:18:58,710
so look at both.
Often in storytelling we look at content,

276
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,610
but we forget how are we going
to communicate that content.

277
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:07,530
The way that content lines is as
important as the content itself.

278
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,510
It's not just the fact or the data alone,

279
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:13,350
but how you're bringing that fat
alive that makes all the difference.

280
00:19:13,351 --> 00:19:16,890
So explore that in your stories and lost.
You know,

281
00:19:16,891 --> 00:19:21,891
a lot of damage has been done to business
storytelling by something called CTA,

282
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,090
call to action.

283
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:28,920
And we try to close all our stories
by emphasizing the call to action.

284
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:33,180
But don't state the obvious when
you can see that begging bowl there,

285
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:36,480
we can see that the bar there,
that's the call to action.

286
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,220
You don't need to spell it out.

287
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,890
You don't need to tell
people what needs to be done.

288
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,820
And you don't need to say put $5 here
because you could be excluding the

289
00:19:44,821 --> 00:19:48,750
possibility of somebody putting $20 there.
So don't,

290
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:53,730
don't get too excited by CTA.
Use it very judiciously.

291
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:56,880
You know,
CTA is not call to action is,

292
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:01,740
has almost become a mandatory and the
user like a mandatory put the mandatories

293
00:20:01,741 --> 00:20:03,600
which are there,
which are required to be put in.

294
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,120
But think about what is mandatory and
what is not. And don't state the obvious.

295
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,350
Now we work, you know, you know, there
are firms like KPMG and Deloitte,

296
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:17,430
there are audit phones, right? You could
think of us and the work that I do,

297
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,850
the work that we do at story Weller's,
uh,

298
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,700
is we audit stories and
we audit presentations.

299
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,200
And you'll be surprised
to see how much, uh, of,

300
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:31,620
of Vias we come across in presentations
that is not required there.

301
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,600
One of the best ways,
you know,

302
00:20:33,601 --> 00:20:37,860
easiest ways to make presentations
better is to remove the obvious from

303
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:40,800
presentation. It's not by
adding, but by removing that,

304
00:20:40,801 --> 00:20:42,270
sometimes we make our stories better.

305
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:47,010
See what you can remove from your stories
and those stories will come out far

306
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:50,140
beautifully. Now, you know,

307
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,990
if you look at universal
story structures and say,

308
00:20:52,991 --> 00:20:55,390
how do I leverage this for
the product that I'm building?

309
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,340
I work on a product team.
You know we are,

310
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:59,830
we are looking at this
particular innovation and and,

311
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:02,110
and we believe that this is going
to change the world. How do I cheat?

312
00:21:02,111 --> 00:21:04,750
How do I take,
go out and tell the story of this product?

313
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:09,550
How do I communicate it internally
to stakeholders? How do I get buy in?

314
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:13,670
How do I get a budget on this project?
How do I buy it? You know, our,

315
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,690
our deadline extension on this project.
How do I tell the story of this product?

316
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:21,340
All stories come from a universal story
structure, which is fairly simple.

317
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:25,390
There's a character in a story,
there's conflict and there is resolution.

318
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:29,650
Central to a story is conflict.
When there is no conflict,

319
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:35,140
there is no story. So let me say
this again. If there is no conflict,

320
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:39,390
there is no story. One of the ways to look
at conflict as the same problem, right?

321
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,160
It's a simpler word is problem.
Boy loves girl.

322
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:45,790
Girl loves boy and they
live happily ever after.

323
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,070
Nobody seen that story.

324
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,530
Nobody's written that book.
Nobody's seen that movie.

325
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,960
But boy loves girl.

326
00:21:56,170 --> 00:22:00,010
Girl loves boy and father says naive.
Yes,

327
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:05,020
shoddy may Osec team know and there's
a story there without a conflict,

328
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,360
there is no story.

329
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:11,350
If the quarter was had given to
ponder was what was rightfully theirs,

330
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:16,480
we wouldn't have had the Mahabharata.
If, if Ramona had not kidnapped sita,

331
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:20,980
we won't have had the law mine. If
there's no conflict, there is no story.

332
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,170
Now that's a universal story structure.

333
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:26,440
How do we leverage it in business
and how do we sort of, you know,

334
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:29,440
how do we take that and bring
it into the world of business?

335
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,600
For me it's way simple.

336
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:38,400
Without a conflict there is no business
because an entrepreneur looks at

337
00:22:38,771 --> 00:22:43,771
conflict as a problem in consumers lives
and he says the flip side of that is an

338
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:47,950
opportunity for an entrepreneur,
for an innovator, for a pioneer.

339
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,630
And when you resolve that,

340
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:54,310
then there is a story in play and if you
can't resolve it then it's not a great

341
00:22:54,311 --> 00:22:55,144
story.

342
00:22:56,290 --> 00:23:00,550
So do you see this innovation and story,

343
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:05,850
business and story have the same structure
now keeping this at the back of your

344
00:23:06,911 --> 00:23:08,710
mind,
let's see how you know,

345
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:13,600
let me share with you a simple framework
using which we can tell the stories of

346
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:18,010
our products, any kind of product, any
kind of innovation that we are building.

347
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,320
And that structure is fairly simple.

348
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:24,820
I talked about contrast earlier and the
way to paint a picture of that world is

349
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:28,000
to use something like this and
fill in the blanks and say,

350
00:23:28,001 --> 00:23:31,750
imagine a world where Dash Dash,

351
00:23:31,751 --> 00:23:36,751
dash what kind of a world do you envision
with the kind of product that you are

352
00:23:37,351 --> 00:23:39,400
building?
What will happen in that world?

353
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,430
What would people do
that they don't do today?

354
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:46,190
Or what can people do that
they are not able to do today?

355
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,870
What do you see in that world?
Describe that world way.

356
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,540
Simply use contrast,
use metaphor.

357
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:57,620
Bring that world alive in a way that
is inspiring so that people raise their

358
00:23:57,621 --> 00:23:59,930
hand and say,
I want to be a citizen of that world.

359
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:04,010
Let me give an example from
a non tech perspective.

360
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:10,190
Dow uh, you know, globally said that,
you know, there is a big conflict.

361
00:24:10,191 --> 00:24:13,010
What does, you know, so
brands, products, innovations,

362
00:24:13,011 --> 00:24:16,310
ideas have to resolve conflicts. They've
said, hey, there's a big conflict.

363
00:24:16,311 --> 00:24:21,290
Every morning millions of women around
the world wake up and when they look at

364
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:23,960
themselves in the mirror,
they are not happy with what they see.

365
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,520
They see themselves as themselves and
they are not happy with what they see.

366
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:32,120
And that's a big conflict. They are
not happy because the world of beauty,

367
00:24:32,121 --> 00:24:33,140
the world of fashion,

368
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:36,350
the world of cosmetics is telling
them that you are not beautiful.

369
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:42,440
You are not beautiful. The lady
on Vogue, she is beautiful.

370
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:47,270
The lady on Cosmopolitan, she is
beautiful. The lady on Feminine,

371
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,260
she is beautiful. The radio on red carpet.
She is beautiful. The lady in Hollywood,

372
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:53,120
she is beautiful but you aren't.

373
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:57,020
And there's a big distance between
where you are and where they are.

374
00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:00,860
And she sees that distance and she said,
that's impossible for me to achieve.

375
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:04,310
And when you see that in possibility
and say, hey, it's beyond me,

376
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:08,870
you feel bad about where you are because
somebody else has taken ownership of

377
00:25:08,871 --> 00:25:13,010
the beauty story and said, this is what
beautiful is. Now that's a big conflict.

378
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:18,050
How do they resolve it?
Or how are they trying to resolve it?

379
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:23,650
By taking ownership of the story
of beauty and rewriting that story.

380
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,850
So a possible articulation
for them could be,

381
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:34,030
imagine a world where beautiful is the
body we are born with is the way I look

382
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:35,324
right now.

383
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:50,900
[inaudible] [inaudible]

384
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:52,280
well that's one kind of an example,
right? You don't need a tech product,

385
00:26:52,281 --> 00:26:56,960
you don't need, sometimes all you need
is insight into what a big conflict is.

386
00:26:57,050 --> 00:27:01,060
And once you identify a conflict
that is large enough for people, uh,

387
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,440
that people face,
then you will find a solution.

388
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,980
And that solution can be a product,
can be communication,

389
00:27:06,981 --> 00:27:09,710
that solution can be a service.
Uh,

390
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:12,170
there are many kinds of solutions
that are possible, right?

391
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,490
But then you have to tell the story,
uh,

392
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,110
of that product for people to
want to be citizens of that world.

393
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:20,390
And you're a tell that
story again and again,

394
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:24,350
and you will tell that story and pitch
that story to really stake holders and

395
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,900
contextualize it to them
over a period of time.

396
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:31,460
And you have to refresh that story as
well. Now that story can work. You know,

397
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:33,200
this framework is a beautiful framework.

398
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:36,080
Imagine a world where it works
for all kinds of products.

399
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:40,850
So to give you an example from a
very different kind of a world,

400
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:43,040
you are familiar with the game scrabble,
right?

401
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:48,170
[inaudible] a game that helps you build
vocabulary. Now that's really simple,

402
00:27:48,171 --> 00:27:52,130
right? You know, uh, imagine a world
where people hired Richard vocabularies.

403
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,210
Now that's a big conflict in life.
Our vocabularies are shrinking.

404
00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:00,200
And then I go back to the
principles of business, toy dealing.

405
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:05,800
There's truth and there is well tuned
to be able to articulate something well.

406
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,270
It remember, it's not just what
you say, but how you say it.

407
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:12,020
We need Witcher vocabularies.
That's the tool.

408
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:15,980
Let's do retailers work with.
Look around you. Leaders,

409
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:18,830
business leaders have richer
vocabularies then followers.

410
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:22,940
Political leaders have richer
vocabulary is and followers.

411
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:26,660
Spiritual leaders have richer
vocabulary than followers.

412
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,680
There's a straight correlation.
It's simple correlation.

413
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,590
If you want to be a good storyteller,
billyo vocabulary,

414
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:38,450
build your verbal vocabulary, language,
vocabulary, visual vocabulary,

415
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:42,800
oral vocabulary bill,
but build your vocabulary right now.

416
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:45,290
Imagine a world where people
had Richard vocabularies.

417
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:48,740
You know vocabularies are shrinking
today. If you ask the kid, hey,

418
00:28:48,741 --> 00:28:51,620
how was that birthday party
that you went to? Awesome.

419
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,560
Hey, you went and saw that flume
general book. How was that? Awesome?

420
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:01,070
Hey,
you asked Lipo or how was that awesome?

421
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,630
Even Mcdonald's had French fries
and above. How was that awesome?

422
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,980
One day you will wonder,
your fallen in love.

423
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:13,820
One day you'll hold somebody's hand.
You will see the sun go down.

424
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:17,840
You will see thousands of shades
of orange. You will kiss someone,

425
00:29:17,841 --> 00:29:20,840
you will make love to someone. What
will you come back and say, awesome.

426
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:27,310
You use,
you use that word for French fries.

427
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:35,710
[inaudible] so you see you.

428
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:36,820
When

429
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:39,850
vocabulary shrink we have,

430
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,100
we have available,

431
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:47,400
we have lesser power to communicate our
ideas in a way that touches the heart

432
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:52,600
and we can't communicate. So in
order to become better communicators,

433
00:29:52,601 --> 00:29:56,590
we need to build your be a storyteller.
Abellio vocabulary and Billy are visual.

434
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:59,680
They're all kinds of vocabularies.
Verbal is one. But you know,

435
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:03,370
explore what vocabulary you can be strong
at and build that because if you can't,

436
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,820
then how will you express new
ideas in interesting ways,

437
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:11,110
all existing ideas in you obese.
But that's what storytellers do.

438
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:16,450
Now when that guy had put up a board,
all he was saying was, I'm blind.

439
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:20,080
Please help. He was using two
magic words, please and help.

440
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:24,100
But we've seen so much of
that that it's not working.

441
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:28,570
So when messaging becomes leverage as
words that everybody is familiar with,

442
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:33,870
that messaging becomes blind spot and
people see it but people don't see it.

443
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:38,470
It's like cows in India, you'll see
them but you don't see them, right.

444
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,740
That beggars at the, at, at, at the
traffic signals you'll see them,

445
00:30:41,741 --> 00:30:45,670
but you don't see them. And it takes a
foreigner to come into India and they say,

446
00:30:45,671 --> 00:30:49,840
Oh my God, you got cars on the road.
Good. Good, good, good, good, good,

447
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:54,100
great. So because they see
from a fresh perspective.

448
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:59,200
And do you remember when he asked
the lady, what did you do to my sign?

449
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:04,540
She didn't make the holding bigger.
She didn't put four signs.

450
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,090
She is not increasing
the media spend on the,

451
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:10,240
on the messaging on the same spin,

452
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:13,330
on the same size of poster.
She,

453
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:17,530
all she did was changed the messaging.
It's woke up.

454
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:21,730
It's how we say it that makes
all the difference. So, you know,

455
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,850
imagine a world where people have
the power of vocabularies. So, uh,

456
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,870
this is from the work that
you know, uh, organ. We,

457
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:33,910
the agency that I worked with earlier and
advertising did for scrabble in India.

458
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:43,030
Hey, you do cut me off. Well, your name,

459
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:46,590
I was like goofy people,

460
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,480
chefs and you while you're late.

461
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:54,860
So I have to know mania. What? Oh,

462
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:57,400
okay. Okay. You take risk

463
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,260
losing my words.

464
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:10,270
There's vocabulary.
Better storyteller.

465
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:12,970
Okay.

466
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:14,260
That's a powerful framework.

467
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:19,300
It can be used for world changing ideas
for big conflicts like the conflict

468
00:32:19,301 --> 00:32:21,340
women face in the world today.

469
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,790
Smaller conflicts in a humorous tone.

470
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,880
It can also be used for
technology products.

471
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:33,210
If we were to go back in time and since
we are at Google I and say, you know,

472
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,030
if let's,

473
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:38,050
let's use the framework to say how do
we tell the story of Google search?

474
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:41,960
A good metaphor could be not,
you know,

475
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:45,950
imagine a world where
people can find the needle.

476
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:47,810
You're looking for your needle,

477
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:53,440
not anybody's else's needle but your
needle in a haystack because that's what

478
00:32:54,381 --> 00:32:58,070
the world wide web is. And the
worldwide web is full of search results.

479
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:02,810
But our algorithm makes it easy
for you to find your needle,

480
00:33:02,811 --> 00:33:05,970
which is based on relevance, which is
based on this which is based on that Dah,

481
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:10,220
Dah, Dah, Dah. It's simple
metaphor, right? Complex Algorithm,

482
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:11,780
simple story.

483
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:16,190
Imagine a world where everybody can
find their needle in a haystack.

484
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:23,470
So see how you can use a framework like
that to tell the story of the product

485
00:33:23,931 --> 00:33:26,150
that you are building that
Google is building today.

486
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,360
And it's building different kinds of
products and solving different kinds of

487
00:33:29,361 --> 00:33:30,110
conflicts.

488
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:33,050
Yesterday it was solving the conflict
of finding the needle in the haystack.

489
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,650
Today it's finding, you know,
new or conflicts to solve
at, to resolve. Uh, and,

490
00:33:37,651 --> 00:33:42,410
and newer stories have to be told
about those conflicts. Explore that.

491
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:46,880
Now business storytelling is not
just for products. It's not just for,

492
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,770
uh, it's, it's to be,

493
00:33:48,771 --> 00:33:52,760
it can it still be and can be
used in all kinds of contexts,

494
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:57,680
including leadership and leadership is
not just about vision and setting the

495
00:33:57,681 --> 00:33:59,240
vision.
That's a large part of it.

496
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,840
But it's also about building a team and
working along with team nurturing a team,

497
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:03,770
nurturing talent.

498
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:09,560
So I'm happy to share with you a story
of when I realized the power of story

499
00:34:09,561 --> 00:34:14,450
when I use it during a
performance appraisal. No,

500
00:34:14,451 --> 00:34:15,800
not my performance appraisal.

501
00:34:15,801 --> 00:34:20,200
When I was conducting
performance appraisal and I
was sitting in my cabin and I

502
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:24,290
led a strategic team of
about seven people, uh,

503
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:27,500
and it was that time of the year.
When you look back at the performance,

504
00:34:27,501 --> 00:34:29,320
when you set goals,
uh,

505
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:34,630
and you assign a number after
that conversation and one by one,

506
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,730
each member of my team were coming
and we were having that conversation.

507
00:34:37,731 --> 00:34:41,390
Now it was time for the best
performer in the team to come in.

508
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:45,920
The best performer in the
team truly deserve this.

509
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:48,500
A very good race because you know,

510
00:34:48,501 --> 00:34:51,770
he had done the equivalent
of filing a patent.

511
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:57,440
A lot of people don't file Peytons and
converting that into a business where

512
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:00,560
most of the patents are not
converted into businesses.

513
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,010
He had done the equivalent of
both in the advertising towns.

514
00:35:04,011 --> 00:35:07,280
Think of it as award winning
advertising that critics love,

515
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,580
but most award winning
advertising doesn't sell products.

516
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:14,840
But this product's were flying
off shelves like hotcakes, right?

517
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:19,280
It done the equipment of both one of the
best performers, not just in my team,

518
00:35:19,281 --> 00:35:22,610
but in the entire office and for
that year in the industry as well.

519
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,740
And it was time for his performance
appraisal and he swaggers into my room.

520
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:31,880
Callers raised,
pulls the chair and sinks into it.

521
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:35,720
Hands raised behind his head,
looks into my eyes.

522
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,500
Okay.

523
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:43,310
Oh, Khaki, look. And when I look
at him, it reminds me of a story.

524
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:47,390
So I sit him down and sometimes bosses
have to practice what is called tough

525
00:35:47,391 --> 00:35:49,160
love.
And I tell him a story.

526
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:54,620
Now that story is from the year 1989
when two wonderful cricketers made their

527
00:35:54,621 --> 00:35:58,460
debut for India. One of them retired
recently as the god of cricket.

528
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:03,020
The other one,
nobody remembers when he retired.

529
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,960
His name is of course what you said.

530
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:09,830
We're not commonly now for those
who love cricket and who know,

531
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,060
and there are many in India,

532
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:16,330
you would notice that
98919901990 (992) 199-0345 years.

533
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:22,250
Who had the higher batting average.

534
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:28,400
We not commonly match after match in all
formats of the game and in all kinds of

535
00:36:29,691 --> 00:36:32,720
games. He was calling more than
than the record consistently.

536
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,610
That's how you get a
higher batting average.

537
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:38,450
And if you go back and listen
to commentary and export
and what they used to say,

538
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:43,200
you know, this guy commonly had a finer
batting technique. He had final shots,

539
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:47,930
election and a wider range of shorts.
But he had one problem,

540
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:53,520
attitude.

541
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:58,520
And in life we underestimate
hardwork and we overestimate talent,

542
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,510
but we underestimate what hard work.
And I could,

543
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,570
I could see a story unfolding here.
They was talent here.

544
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:09,600
Batting average was high,
but it came with something else.

545
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,750
And I got reminded of that story.

546
00:37:12,751 --> 00:37:15,990
So I shared that story with him and I
added some more bits stored. And I said,

547
00:37:15,991 --> 00:37:19,760
you know what, you know, after
many years after this, you know,

548
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,000
after 10 years later,

549
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,900
there was a guy who grew up watching 10
deluca play and he made his debut for

550
00:37:24,901 --> 00:37:29,780
India and his name is William the say
well and he went on to do what Endoka

551
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:34,860
always dreamt of but could
never do, not once, but twice,

552
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:38,280
which is why he's called Sultan of molten.
He scored those tuples centuries,

553
00:37:38,281 --> 00:37:40,620
not in India,
but in conditions which are difficult,

554
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:45,390
which are tailored for Bolos and
tend to always dreamt of that.

555
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:49,350
But he could never, but you
know what? And then, you know,

556
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:52,500
you Raj did something that tend to always
wanted to do but could never achieve.

557
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:54,390
Right.
Six sixes.

558
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:57,930
But if there was one thing that sets apart
then the worker from all the players,

559
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:59,430
it was as hunger for the game.

560
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:04,970
It was his passion for the game and the
fact that that many years later when he,

561
00:38:05,191 --> 00:38:08,610
he was considered the god of
cricket and he had nothing to prove.

562
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:13,790
Even then he would go to the nets
half an hour before everybody else.

563
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:19,260
He would put an much more
hard work and, and, and,

564
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:24,540
and good stories like this happen
when talent meets hard work.

565
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:27,030
I told that story to my friend,

566
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:31,770
to my colleague who was working with me
and seven years have passed since then

567
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,390
and in seven years there are people
who used to report to you, uh,

568
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:37,330
do you have a different
relationship after with them?

569
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:39,940
Seven years later they become your
contemporaries. They become friends.

570
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,640
I have moved on. I do my own
thing. He does his own thing.

571
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:46,900
But I am happy to report to you
that he continues to be a 10 car.

572
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:51,880
And there are many reasons for that.
First is his own innate talent. Second,

573
00:38:51,881 --> 00:38:54,970
you go to be at the right
place at the right time, but,

574
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:59,560
but he still credits that conversation
as a, as a, as a life changing moment.

575
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:00,970
And he says that,
you know,

576
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:05,710
I have now combined a work ethic
with my talent and that makes all the

577
00:39:05,711 --> 00:39:06,490
difference.

578
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:11,290
So where can we apply stories and
where we are in all walks of life.

579
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,620
When we say business, you know,
business is not just about pitching.

580
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,210
It's not just about fundraising.

581
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:19,690
It's not just about telling the
story of our product, you know,

582
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:23,350
businesses also nurturing talent.
Business is also building a team.

583
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,120
Businesses also setting a vision.

584
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:30,250
And we under leverage stories and
storytelling in all walks of life.

585
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:34,750
When we don't use stories like this and
we don't use and we don't tell stories,

586
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:39,200
uh, where we can. So
when you go out, uh, uh,

587
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:42,990
from here and say, how do I build
a bank of my own stories around?

588
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,860
That's something that we can,
we should all aim for, right?

589
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:47,320
How can I build a bank of
my own stories that again,

590
00:39:47,321 --> 00:39:49,870
use for various situations
for various context.

591
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:53,360
There are three sources really
that you can look into, uh,

592
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:57,340
using which you can build your bank of
stories. The first one is your own life.

593
00:39:57,341 --> 00:40:00,340
Reflect on your own life,
on in, on your own journeys.

594
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:03,550
And your life is rich with stories.

595
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:08,320
So if you could give you a couple of
cues when you look back at your life,

596
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:10,870
because we must,
and we must reflect on our lives.

597
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:15,700
Leaders are reflective practitioners.
They reflect on their lives.

598
00:40:15,701 --> 00:40:16,960
They reflect on their journeys,

599
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:20,170
on their strengths and their weaknesses
and their draw lessons from there.

600
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:22,780
So reflect on your lives.
Ask yourself the question,

601
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:24,820
what is the proudest moment of my life?

602
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,400
Go back to that and see
what made that happen.

603
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:35,590
And there is something there. Look at
that. But also ask yourself the question,

604
00:40:35,591 --> 00:40:37,060
what are the biggest failure in your life?

605
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:41,440
And we've all failed at something
or the other spectacularly.

606
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:46,840
And what is the lesson we can derive
from there? And that's a story.

607
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:50,500
And you would say, hey, why would
I share that story with anyone?

608
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:54,610
But look around and leaders don't hesitate
to share failure stories. In fact,

609
00:40:54,611 --> 00:40:57,460
leaders share failure stories

610
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:02,680
because if you don't share your
failure story in a business,

611
00:41:02,681 --> 00:41:06,370
if you don't add Google, if you
don't learn from our failure stories,

612
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:09,940
those failures will repeat themselves.
So I say this,

613
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:13,730
that a failure stories don't go viral.
Failures go violent.

614
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,420
It's better that stories go viral and we
can all learn from the stories so that

615
00:41:19,421 --> 00:41:23,350
failures don't repeat. So you know,
your own life is a rich source of story.

616
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:28,330
The second is there are stories in your
organization and their stories, you know,

617
00:41:28,331 --> 00:41:30,670
in this company that,
that, that are there.

618
00:41:30,671 --> 00:41:32,690
But we look around and there
are enough stories, you know,

619
00:41:32,691 --> 00:41:36,810
stories of products that have succeeded
like anything, uh, stories of per,

620
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:40,170
of projects that were Abingdon. What can
we learn from those stories? They're,

621
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,620
they're better stories
sometimes too to look,

622
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:46,130
look at and learn from
stories of projects, uh,

623
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:51,131
that could not see Dale flight stories
of projects that didn't go as planned.

624
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:58,100
They were not Abingdon, they were
launched into the market but didn't work.

625
00:41:58,370 --> 00:41:59,720
What can we learn from a customer?

626
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:04,610
What can we learn from a project that
worked beautifully for Emory approach

627
00:42:04,611 --> 00:42:05,301
project?
Actually,

628
00:42:05,301 --> 00:42:08,720
we can break into milestones and we must
have those meetings after the project

629
00:42:08,721 --> 00:42:11,450
is complete. To look at those
three or four milestones and say,

630
00:42:11,451 --> 00:42:12,470
what are the stories we can learn?

631
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:15,890
And then look at life all around
you because life all around you.

632
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:19,580
We are swimming and breathing stories.
Like I use a story from sport.

633
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:21,890
It's all around us.

634
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:25,880
All the story from my theology or we
can learn from other people's stories.

635
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:28,970
So these are the three sources of
stories and reflect on your journey.

636
00:42:28,971 --> 00:42:32,780
Reflect on your stories and
see which story you can,

637
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:36,680
you can tell and build into
your bank of stories. Uh,

638
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,400
and I say there's that the best
stories come to you when you listen.

639
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,520
Great storytellers are
not just great orators.

640
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:45,680
They're not just people
with great vocabularies.

641
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:50,540
You become a good storyteller when you
listen because when you listen you will

642
00:42:50,541 --> 00:42:52,370
get your stories.
On that note,

643
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:56,570
I'm happy to share a story with you and
many years ago when television was a new

644
00:42:56,571 --> 00:42:57,350
idea,

645
00:42:57,350 --> 00:43:01,940
there was this guy who used to go from
place to place selling TVs and he would

646
00:43:01,941 --> 00:43:03,040
go to this,
you don't,

647
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,320
to up to a place that had not heard of
television and he would sell the concept

648
00:43:06,321 --> 00:43:10,910
called TV to them. One day he reached a
village where you saw a strange sight.

649
00:43:10,911 --> 00:43:11,780
He saw that,
you know,

650
00:43:11,781 --> 00:43:15,920
every evening people gather around a
fire in the evening after they come back

651
00:43:15,921 --> 00:43:19,760
from work and they share stories
with each other. He said, Hey,

652
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:23,690
you guys love listening to stories,
right? And you guys love sharing stories.

653
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:27,650
You guys will love this box.
It tells you a lot of stories.

654
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:32,750
Everybody loved that idea and every
house in that village bought a TV.

655
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:37,940
It was his best sale in months.
So far. He was so happy.

656
00:43:37,941 --> 00:43:41,030
He had met his quota for the, for
the, for the next three months.

657
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:46,150
He went on holiday and then he went on
to other places and a few months passed

658
00:43:47,211 --> 00:43:48,044
and he was,

659
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:52,010
he was coming back and he was passing
by the same village and he said,

660
00:43:52,011 --> 00:43:56,030
I must visit this village. These people
were so nice. They bought so many TVs.

661
00:43:56,031 --> 00:44:00,680
I met my sales target for three months,
so he stopped by to pay them a visit,

662
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:03,860
but he was met with a strange sight.

663
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,830
He saw all the TVS lying,

664
00:44:06,831 --> 00:44:11,540
stacked one on top of the
other gathering dust. He said,

665
00:44:11,541 --> 00:44:13,760
let me wait here and figure
out what's happening. So He's,

666
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:15,920
he waited in the village in the evening,

667
00:44:15,921 --> 00:44:20,330
everybody came back from work and as
usual they gathered around the fire and

668
00:44:20,331 --> 00:44:24,100
started telling stories to each other and
he went at that point of time and said,

669
00:44:24,101 --> 00:44:26,030
Hey, what happened? Remember me?

670
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:31,120
You bought all those TVs
where the gathering dust
and the village elders spoke

671
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:37,440
and he said, Beta. I know
initially these boxes,

672
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:38,640
they were wonderful.

673
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:44,060
They told us a lot of stories from here
and they're from places near and far and

674
00:44:45,661 --> 00:44:50,220
stories about about off places and things
that we had never visited before and

675
00:44:50,221 --> 00:44:52,740
it was wonderful.
But there's one big problem.

676
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,380
It doesn't listen to us stories

677
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:02,820
and a lot of communication has become
like that today where people are just full

678
00:45:02,821 --> 00:45:05,460
of their stories and they
want to tell their stories.

679
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:10,140
But we have no time to listen to other
people's stories. But great leaders,

680
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:15,650
great marketers and innovators are able
to lead market and innovate because they

681
00:45:19,121 --> 00:45:23,280
listen to people's stories.
Not just business leaders
but also political leader.

682
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:27,840
That's how we solve problems and that's
how conflicts are resolved in the world.

683
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:32,160
Not just by telling stories but by
listening to other people's stories.

684
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:37,340
So see what stories you can listen to
and how they lead you to your ideas.

685
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:40,950
And then once you build
that idea into a product,

686
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:45,180
see how we can go and tell the
story of that product. On that note,

687
00:45:45,181 --> 00:45:49,530
I'll end with a story and then we'll
open up for questions if you have any.

688
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,760
A long time ago.
There was an old man,

689
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,320
this old man had a long white
flowing beard and he had a nice,

690
00:45:58,321 --> 00:46:02,340
interesting jacket with wonderful designs
and lots of pockets and wherever the

691
00:46:02,341 --> 00:46:05,940
old man went, people would call out to
him, reach out to him and say, hey, hey,

692
00:46:05,941 --> 00:46:09,510
hey all mine, why don't you come
and spend some time with us?

693
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:13,020
Everybody loved the old man.
They said, hey, old man,

694
00:46:13,021 --> 00:46:16,050
come and spend some time with us,
have some tea and cake with us.

695
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:19,080
I have some wine and cheese with us.
Everybody loved the old guy.

696
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:24,180
At the same time in the world,
there was a lady, wherever she went,

697
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:27,540
people shut their doors and windows.
Nobody liked the lady.

698
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:31,200
The lady was very upset.
She goes to the old man and says,

699
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:36,090
why is it that wherever you go, you
are welcome. But I'm turned away.

700
00:46:36,091 --> 00:46:41,040
Who are you? The old man, he destructors
hold the shoulders. He smiled and said,

701
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:45,320
I am story. Who are you?
And she said, I am truck.

702
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:50,460
You see you. Nobody likes
the truth. But she said, oh,

703
00:46:50,461 --> 00:46:52,200
I'm going to make it easier for people.

704
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:56,280
So she removed her clothes and she
hoped that people would now welcome her,

705
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:58,290
but nobody likes the naked truth.

706
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:04,650
But the old man had the wisdom to
know that the world needs the truth.

707
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:08,970
So he, he spoke to her and he said,
lady, why don't you come along with me?

708
00:47:08,971 --> 00:47:12,000
There's much more hospitality
than I need for myself.

709
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:16,080
There's much more a wine and cheese that
I need for myself as much more tea and

710
00:47:16,081 --> 00:47:18,150
cake that I need for myself.
I can share with you,

711
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:19,440
why don't you come along with me?

712
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:23,640
And that's exactly what truth did
towards jumped into stories pocket.

713
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:27,630
And from that day, my friends that
has said that, wherever story goes,

714
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:29,570
you can find tooth

715
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:33,713
data.

716
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:40,390
The day does that.

717
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,650
What does that fact rapid in the
story and where will that story goes?

718
00:47:44,651 --> 00:47:46,870
You'll find that truth.
On that note,

719
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:51,310
I close and I hope your story
takes you to interesting places.

720
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:53,980
Don't hesitate to share your story.
Listen,

721
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:58,990
share and gloved and male story
take you to wonderful places.

722
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:00,790
Because like I said,

723
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:05,080
wonderful stories happen to
people who tell them, well,

724
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:09,470
this is the point where I say,

725
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,940
I'm happy to take questions if you
have and happier if you have none.

726
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:17,540
Open House.
Yes sir.

727
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:22,423
Can you just stand?

728
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:29,060
I have lots of them. Uh,
but the uh, you know,

729
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:34,360
uh, and there are many failures,
uh, that we've all had.

730
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:41,620
Uh, one of the failures that I had, uh,

731
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:46,770
when I started the farm and I had never
been an entrepreneur before and you

732
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:50,130
know, had worked in, you
know, as a salaried employee,

733
00:48:50,131 --> 00:48:54,240
you'd be know and we have no
entrepreneurial born gene, uh,

734
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:58,950
in the family. My parents were teachers.
All of my cousins are below, uh,

735
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:03,550
either teachers or doctors or employees.
And when I started off,

736
00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:04,890
uh,

737
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:09,040
I really didn't know how to
build that business and I,

738
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:11,700
that's why I started story wireless.

739
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:15,070
I decided that I'll work from office.

740
00:49:15,071 --> 00:49:19,450
So I hired an office space and all I
used to do was go to office and set an

741
00:49:19,451 --> 00:49:20,284
operate from there.

742
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:24,070
But there was no business was coming
in and I realized that this is not how

743
00:49:24,071 --> 00:49:24,700
business works.

744
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:27,940
I was expecting business to come and
just because in my mind I thought our

745
00:49:27,941 --> 00:49:31,240
business has, and then I have to
figure out a lot of things on how to,

746
00:49:31,241 --> 00:49:33,610
we still don't do business
development in the traditional sense.

747
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:38,590
All our business comes in, uh,
and, and knocks at our door.

748
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:42,460
But how to get them to knock at our
door is, is a big lesson that I learned.

749
00:49:42,461 --> 00:49:45,910
I had no idea how to do that. And there
are really two ways of building business.

750
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,970
If you look at all methods
of building business,

751
00:49:48,971 --> 00:49:50,320
you can put them into two buckets.

752
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:53,620
The first bucket is you go
and knock on somebody's door.

753
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:57,340
The second bucket is you get
people to knock at your door.

754
00:49:58,330 --> 00:50:02,800
And I failed at this
miserably and I learned that.

755
00:50:02,801 --> 00:50:04,300
So first year,
if I,

756
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:08,600
if I go and look at the first year of
business that we did at story wireless

757
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,810
for the first nine months,
our billing was zero.

758
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:16,570
And I loaned her the hardware.

759
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:20,200
But now that I learned how to get people
to knock at your door and sometimes

760
00:50:20,201 --> 00:50:22,600
video is good because you know,
if I can reflect on it,

761
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:26,410
if you can develop on it and see
what made you fail and learn from it,

762
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:30,710
then it's good.
Thanks and wonderful question.

763
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:37,003
Uh,

764
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:41,240
us what need more precise with our means,

765
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:44,250
which is generally going to
try and to get an approval.

766
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,440
Most of the times we'll look for stories.
Your mind,

767
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:50,070
is there a good friends to
clean the principles that are,

768
00:50:50,071 --> 00:50:53,760
maybe there's a modification to the
principals district over here and you're

769
00:50:53,761 --> 00:50:56,730
trying to prove
anything.

770
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:02,470
Yup. I think the principles remain
same. The way you apply them, you know,

771
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:05,170
becomes a sharper lens. And, and one,

772
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:09,270
one thing that you would add to this
list of principles is what I call a Wifi.

773
00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:14,250
The wifi is a simple principle.
Doubleu IIF, why Watson it for you?

774
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:18,090
That's a very important principle
because you know somebody's going to get,

775
00:51:18,091 --> 00:51:20,970
give you an extension, not because
there's something in it for you,

776
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:23,880
because there's something at the end of
that extension period that's going to

777
00:51:23,881 --> 00:51:28,410
come back to me, right? So the VP
principle is something that you know,

778
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:33,300
gets added on when we go from these macro
to the micro nuances of everyday work.

779
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:36,180
And you add the Wifi principle
when you asked for an extension,

780
00:51:36,181 --> 00:51:37,620
I'm not asking something for myself.

781
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,930
There's something which is coming
back to you at the end of this.

782
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:42,600
If you don't give it to me, it may
not come back to you. You know,

783
00:51:42,601 --> 00:51:43,800
right now I'm not in a position.

784
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:47,940
And when we walk them through that
and get them to see things from our

785
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:52,380
perspective by to the transport, uh, that,

786
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:56,040
that we are supposed to
do as storytellers, then
they will get that picture.

787
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,190
There's a second one which you didn't ask,
but you know,

788
00:51:59,310 --> 00:52:02,370
we do a lot of work with
numbers and data and, and,

789
00:52:02,371 --> 00:52:06,420
and when you apply these principles,
how do you apply them to numbers and data?

790
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:08,280
Uh,
that's,

791
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:13,140
that's perhaps another talk for
about 15 minutes or 20 minutes.

792
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:17,790
There are three or four
specific principles that help
us bring numbers and data

793
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:22,380
to life. There's somebody from
Google who's done wonderful work,

794
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:27,600
uh, Google, uh, in other market where we
would, where she's written a book as well.

795
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,640
She's no longer with Google,
uh,

796
00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:32,640
but she's written a book on how to
tell stories using numbers and data.

797
00:52:32,641 --> 00:52:34,320
And that's a good reference
point to get started.

798
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,390
But the principles are fairly simple.

799
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:38,973
Okay.

800
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:40,860
Uh,
the name will come back to me in a bit,

801
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:58,940
speak louder than thousand words. We've
all heard that before. Uh, but you know,

802
00:52:58,941 --> 00:53:01,040
we, uh, when I speak of pitchers,

803
00:53:01,041 --> 00:53:04,280
I don't just mean pictures in
the sense that we'll use to,

804
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:06,800
we used to think of them. Of
course. They're very powerful.

805
00:53:06,801 --> 00:53:09,770
I can tell you a story
about how Ratan Tata, uh,

806
00:53:09,771 --> 00:53:12,300
when he briefed the team four, nine, oh,

807
00:53:12,301 --> 00:53:14,960
which is one of the biggest disruptions
that happened in the automotive world,

808
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:19,240
uh, before Google and
Tesla came along. Uh, uh,

809
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,700
that journey was triggered
with a presentation that
use one slide and one photo

810
00:53:22,701 --> 00:53:25,950
in much line.
And that photo was that he saw,

811
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:30,110
he saw a family of four on a scooter.
I'm Hamare do.

812
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,790
And all he did was he came back,

813
00:53:32,791 --> 00:53:37,440
he sketched that on a piece of paper
and he's, he's, you know, he says,

814
00:53:37,441 --> 00:53:39,630
I'm not great at sketching,
but he's gets that. And He,

815
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:41,970
and he do a roof on top of that scooter.

816
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:44,880
And he gave it to his secretary and he
said, can you scan that? And he's this,

817
00:53:44,881 --> 00:53:47,160
can that image and put
that into the presentation.

818
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:51,060
The Nana wasn't called an I know Nana
wasn't born. It wasn't even conceived of.

819
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:56,070
He put that photograph on the slide
and call the top management deck CFO,

820
00:53:56,220 --> 00:54:00,480
head of manufacturing, head of
marketing, a head of design.

821
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:05,750
And with that one slide he explained
the target audience for whom they were

822
00:54:05,911 --> 00:54:09,690
building a product. He explained
the conflict. You know,

823
00:54:09,691 --> 00:54:12,750
these are people who are exposed to
elements, people who are exposed to rains,

824
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:17,180
people who are exposed to beggars at a,
and all kinds of things at uh,

825
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:19,950
traffic lights. Right? So
he explained the conflict,

826
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:24,300
but through that slide he also said, what
is the, what are the target audience?

827
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:27,180
And when you say the target audience,
he also explained to that side,

828
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:28,740
what is the price constraint?

829
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:34,570
We are not making a car four car
upgraders we are making a car for four

830
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:38,700
upgraders who are going to buy a car
for the first time scooter upgraders two

831
00:54:38,701 --> 00:54:41,190
car.
And that has a price target.

832
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:44,850
And that price target
too that he explained the
materials problem because they

833
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,350
were not to do, to achieve that. You know,

834
00:54:46,351 --> 00:54:49,650
they will have to be some innovation in
terms of materials and metallurgy and

835
00:54:49,651 --> 00:54:52,810
how you fuse glass with
metal and all of that. Uh,

836
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:56,250
so he spoke to the head of design,
head of manufacturing, head of finance,

837
00:54:56,370 --> 00:55:00,990
head of marketing, all of that to one
slide. Now that's a powerful example, but,

838
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,630
but I don't mean visuals
only in that sense.

839
00:55:03,631 --> 00:55:05,160
That's one part of your visual vocabulary.

840
00:55:05,161 --> 00:55:08,190
The second part of visual
vocabulary is data visualization.

841
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:13,680
How do you bring your data alive for
any two sets of data on x and y axes?

842
00:55:14,370 --> 00:55:17,460
Today there are 20
visualizations that are possible.

843
00:55:17,461 --> 00:55:21,210
You can bring it alive and graph
a versus graph B. Typically,

844
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:25,260
we don't explore those 20 visualization
to say which one is the best to

845
00:55:25,261 --> 00:55:28,910
communicate the Wifi,
which one is the simplest.

846
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:32,990
We don't put up four slides for four
different charts and say which one

847
00:55:32,991 --> 00:55:35,960
communicates. There's the
boost. We don't do that.

848
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:41,720
Typically we just go ahead with what
comes to us intuitively. And, and, and,

849
00:55:41,721 --> 00:55:44,330
and developing that vocabulary
takes some time. But you know,

850
00:55:44,331 --> 00:55:47,960
he just a function of doing something
again and again and you get better at it.

851
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:52,680
So that's, that's on
visual vocabulary. Uh,

852
00:55:52,681 --> 00:55:53,880
and there was another question from there.

853
00:55:53,881 --> 00:55:57,540
That's the last question we'll
take and then we'll stop. Uh, yes.

854
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:09,580
Well, uh, my mother, uh, you
know, when I was growing up,

855
00:56:10,370 --> 00:56:14,390
we had a lot of stories,
uh, about partition. Uh,

856
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:19,330
we had a lot of stories. I was brought
up by a single parent, uh, about loss,

857
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:24,640
uh, off things and family.
Uh, I heard a lot of stories.

858
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,310
She was a teacher,
so I had a lot of stories about,

859
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:30,910
about how we should look at life.
Uh,

860
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:35,010
and she was a teacher in the
purest sense. No tuitions, uh,

861
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,510
uh, she believes, yeah. Then the,

862
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:41,240
that the best education is that you can
give during the class, not afterwards.

863
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:44,840
And if you're not doing that, then you're
not doing a good job as a teacher. So,

864
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:49,820
you know, all, all the good things that
we learn from teachers. I know she was my,

865
00:56:50,570 --> 00:56:51,650
she was my first teacher.

866
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:55,880
The mothers are typically
your first teachers at home.

867
00:56:56,090 --> 00:57:00,190
I have a lot of stories from her. Uh,
in terms of business storytelling. Uh,

868
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:04,810
there's this wonderful guy I worked with
for 10 years. Uh, his name is Santos Dsi.

869
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:07,910
Uh, he's written a wonderful book. He
writes a column in the Times of India,

870
00:57:07,911 --> 00:57:12,110
every Monday, a Citi, Citi
Bank bank. That's the guy. Uh,

871
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:15,050
I think he's a fantastic storyteller.

872
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,100
I've had a wonderful working
relationship with them.

873
00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:20,360
And then it's really rare that you
work with somebody for 10 years.

874
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:23,060
I have learned a lot
by seeing him at work.

875
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:26,240
[inaudible] is a wonderful
storyteller and tell you why,

876
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:31,280
to me great stories or truth well told.
And when I say truth,

877
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:35,000
well told you have to live that truth.
Embody that truth in your life.

878
00:57:35,510 --> 00:57:37,970
When he told us people fly economy,

879
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:40,130
yeah,

880
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:42,980
that's not messaging.
You have to live that truth yourself.

881
00:57:43,170 --> 00:57:47,930
You have to fly con me. That story
has to be evident in your life, right?

882
00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:52,560
So he lived his story and he lived
life by the story that he told.

883
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:55,520
When you can live your life
by the stories that you tell,

884
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:57,050
you're a fantastic storyteller.

885
00:58:01,290 --> 00:58:02,640
Thank you for having me.

886
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:11,810
Eventually, you know, time runs out
for everything, including life. Uh,

887
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:13,960
but that doesn't mean that, you
know, questions have to end here.

888
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:18,360
That's my email id. I'd love to hear from
you if you have more questions. Uh, uh,

889
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,340
send them in. I'm, I usually
respond to mail within 48 hours.

890
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:24,400
Have a nice evening ahead.

891
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:28,620
Yeah.
