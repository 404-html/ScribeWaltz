1
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:06,471
So Lou,

2
00:00:06,471 --> 00:00:11,471
maybe tell us about your journey in early
Korea in corporate and why you mix a

3
00:00:12,531 --> 00:00:17,330
decision to jump. So yeah. So, hi
everyone. I'm so happy to be here.

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,000
Um, last time I was here, I was in my
role as a mentor for Google Launchpad,

5
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,440
so I'm very excited to be back,
um,

6
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:28,880
to give you a little bit of background
about my past and professional life.

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,690
Um, so as shelter and I'm
trying to ease and um,

8
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,480
and when you grow up as a Chinese child,
you have a lot of expectations, you know,

9
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:41,210
from your family at that you
need to fulfill, to have,
um, you know, a good life,

10
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:46,220
um, or to be deemed successful. So my
parents always wanted to meet to Amino,

11
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:51,020
be go either into business or into
law or into, uh, into medicine.

12
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,360
Right. And, um, so I chose business
and the business called in Germany.

13
00:00:56,361 --> 00:00:58,580
So I was born in China and
then grew up in Germany,

14
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,010
but all my education in Germany
went to business school.

15
00:01:01,011 --> 00:01:06,011
I'm in Germany on star with Mckinsey
in Munich almost 10 years ago,

16
00:01:06,651 --> 00:01:08,960
nine years ago,
Asian genes.

17
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:16,170
And, um, and yeah, so I started
with working with Mckinsey,
then moved onto drunk,

18
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,560
um, P and g and, um,

19
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,320
work in Switzerland in brand
management and marketing.

20
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:26,090
And I've done that for about five,
four or five years in total.

21
00:01:26,091 --> 00:01:30,500
And then I sort of jumped,
uh, and uh, you know,

22
00:01:30,501 --> 00:01:34,670
just kind of became my own
person, if that makes sense. Um,

23
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,020
kind of embarked on this part on the,
of,

24
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,940
of being an entrepreneur and I'm trying
to find out what I want to do on my own.

25
00:01:40,941 --> 00:01:42,350
And the reason for that,
um,

26
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,040
to lots of the question actually is I
don't think you ever actually leave a

27
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:50,810
company. I think you leave
a manager think about that.

28
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:56,470
Um, and in my case, you know,
it was kind of, um, you know, I,

29
00:01:56,471 --> 00:01:59,180
I had difficulties with a
buzzer was reporting to. Um,

30
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:02,420
I also saw that he had difficulty,
so boss that he was reporting to.

31
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,840
So if you can all think about the whole
sort of reporting chain, it just doesn't,

32
00:02:05,841 --> 00:02:09,770
but it basically work out and he was like,
oh my God, this is a dead end. And, uh,

33
00:02:09,771 --> 00:02:10,520
you know,
I was,

34
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,520
it was not possible basically for me
to maneuver in any way in that sort of

35
00:02:15,651 --> 00:02:16,370
situation.

36
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,640
And I just basically had to leave the
company to kind of like find something new

37
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,560
and I as I thought, okay, I'm,
you know, I need to remove myself.

38
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,060
I'll just situation too.

39
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:30,070
I want to join another corporate or do I
take the opportunity to do something on

40
00:02:30,201 --> 00:02:33,620
my own. And uh, that
was five years ago, um,

41
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:37,100
and I decided to do something on my
own because I'm one of these people who

42
00:02:37,101 --> 00:02:41,480
think I can do things better
than other papers and the, yeah.

43
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,910
So I'm back on, on that journey. Yeah.

44
00:02:43,911 --> 00:02:48,740
Do you ever wish you could like
maybe quit earlier or like Lucy said,

45
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,140
exactly. Good timing for you
to do so. I think it was the,

46
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,250
it was the right time, I think.
I don't think there's ever, like,

47
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,160
I suppose I'm the best time to leave
a job. Right. You feel it. I mean,

48
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:03,700
you know, when you offer
straight it enough and in my
case, you know, you'll do it,

49
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:08,320
or if there's a big enough other
opportunity, um, that lures you in,

50
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:12,430
then you'll do it. Right. I think, um,
every decision that you know, people make,

51
00:03:12,431 --> 00:03:15,220
then, you know, it's, it's kind of
like if it's comes from the heart,

52
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:17,740
it's kind of like you're
fully like behind it,

53
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,860
then it is the the right time for you.
Right.

54
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:23,770
And for me it was definitely the
right time. I don't think, um,

55
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:28,540
I should have done it earlier or later.
So I don't regret that.

56
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:32,050
I sort of trumped, um, you
know, five years ago. Um,

57
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:35,770
I think what I would say though
is because I was in Switzerland,

58
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,830
I was actually in Germany as an expert
and then I'll move back to Switzerland

59
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:39,963
and it was,

60
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,410
I was not really part of the
entrepreneurial ecosystem
because there was none.

61
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,410
Um, I think knowing that, you know,

62
00:03:47,411 --> 00:03:49,840
sort of being in London and
having so many things around you,

63
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:53,560
I think it's definitely helpful to immerse
herself even while you're employed in

64
00:03:53,561 --> 00:03:57,010
these activities. I mean we, you know, run
a lot of things also over the weekends,

65
00:03:57,011 --> 00:04:01,090
events and all of that. So I think
that's one thing I would have. Um,

66
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,870
I wished I would have had, but I
didn't hide it, I think at the time.

67
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:07,810
So there was no choice.
Cool. And after you create,

68
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,610
do naturally directly go
to entrepreneurship or you
take some time to figure out

69
00:04:12,611 --> 00:04:15,640
what you want to do. And how
long did that take? So, I mean,

70
00:04:15,641 --> 00:04:18,310
I left with the vision to
do something on my own.

71
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:21,640
I didn't know what I want to
do. Um, I just, I suppose,

72
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:24,760
wanted to do something I love, which is
my strength and, uh, do something that,

73
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,770
you know, I'm passionate
about and I love. Right.

74
00:04:26,771 --> 00:04:29,980
And I think that's what a lot of people
think about when this of, you know,

75
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:33,640
quit a job. And, um, and then it's
about actually sort of finding,

76
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:38,590
finding out whether the idea that you
have is a viable business or can be a

77
00:04:38,591 --> 00:04:41,890
viable business. And it's also a
business that you want to actually build.

78
00:04:41,891 --> 00:04:44,410
Because, you know, if you're
working for a big company,

79
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:48,370
you have all the infrastructure, you
know, that, that you can dream of, right?

80
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,240
I mean,
you know,

81
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:53,530
buildings and food and the assistants
and telephones and all of these things

82
00:04:53,531 --> 00:04:57,310
that you have to take off
yourself and your work for
you, for yourself. Right? And,

83
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,050
and people find out that you know,
you,

84
00:04:59,051 --> 00:05:02,650
you like certain things or you are
better at certain things than others.

85
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,770
And uh,
so before I started blooming founders,

86
00:05:05,771 --> 00:05:10,771
I had two other companies which I run by
myself also almost as a one woman show.

87
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,100
And I learned through that process.
I took that for about three years,

88
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,220
was two and a half years,
um,

89
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:23,280
that I don't want to build a company
that just has me as one person,

90
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,640
right? Because obviously you can trade
your time for money and then you know,

91
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:31,720
you can just kind of consult
on in a capacity and you know,

92
00:05:31,721 --> 00:05:35,050
you can pay your rent, you can pay
your expenses. And that's kind of it.

93
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:39,280
But I just realized by doing that, that
after a while that I had, you know,

94
00:05:39,281 --> 00:05:42,880
the ambition or this, you know,
I wasn't satisfied myself,

95
00:05:42,881 --> 00:05:47,881
so I wanted to build something bigger
and more sustainable with more impact and

96
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:53,110
uh, that I couldn't have known in
the beginning. It's kind of, I think,

97
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,680
you know, if you're, you know,

98
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:58,790
taking the leap and then trying
to find out what you want to do,

99
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,820
I think it's a very, very natural
that you're doing different things,

100
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:04,910
trying different projects and find out
what works for you and what doesn't work

101
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:08,410
for you. Um, yeah, so it takes time. Okay.

102
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:13,980
And how does a book idea, Kamala, before
you answer, I just wanted to ask, um,

103
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,080
outings and question,

104
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:20,230
how many of you guys do right hand writing
letters to anyone around the world?

105
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,730
Just hands out of your,
she'll still do that

106
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,750
to families. To friends? Yeah. Nice. Um,

107
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,270
we'll keep a journal Journal,

108
00:06:31,271 --> 00:06:34,760
like how many people write
to themselves a bit more.

109
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:38,570
I wonder like do they write to me
in English or in your mother tongue?

110
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,190
Like native language? It's quite
intimate to write a letter to someone.

111
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,700
So how does the idea come around for you?

112
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,590
So the book idea is kind of,

113
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:52,180
it was one of the first project I
released for those of under my new company

114
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,630
blooming founders. I started completely,
I mean, you know, sort of from scratch,

115
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:01,460
the idea was to kind of
build an infrastructure for
female founders because as I

116
00:07:01,461 --> 00:07:03,080
was out there doing stuff on my own,

117
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:05,910
I realized that a lot of other women
are out there doing stuff on the,

118
00:07:05,911 --> 00:07:09,560
on their own. And then if you're in the
startup ecosystem, you'll see no women.

119
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:13,510
So you kind of like cried to square up
like what's happening here. Right. And,

120
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,970
and it seems to me that there's a
lot of women around, but you know,

121
00:07:16,971 --> 00:07:20,390
there's no infrastructure that they,
they go to apparently.

122
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:25,570
And I didn't know why that was
happening. So I started, um, uh,

123
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:29,430
you know, running events, bringing women
together that are entrepreneurial, uh,

124
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,940
inviting female founders,
speakers and you know,

125
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:35,650
sort of doing talks and it's exactly
what, what you are doing, um,

126
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:38,030
with 90% women and the other.
Then I actually,

127
00:07:38,031 --> 00:07:41,510
I'm so glad that we have a lot
of guys in here. I'm really,

128
00:07:41,511 --> 00:07:44,640
really good because obviously, you know,
the title was there a female founders,

129
00:07:44,641 --> 00:07:49,520
so you know, wasn't
expected. So yay guys. Um,

130
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:53,060
so coming back to, to the, the,
the, the story. Um, so yeah,

131
00:07:53,061 --> 00:07:57,440
so I started doing events and at this
event you obviously network and after,

132
00:07:57,441 --> 00:08:01,180
after the event and um,
you find out over time that you know,

133
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,320
that there are no role models,

134
00:08:03,321 --> 00:08:08,321
are very little few role models that
women have in entrepreneurship that the

135
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:12,650
media talks about the typical
sort of people such as Elon mass,

136
00:08:12,651 --> 00:08:15,070
such as Mark Zuckerberg,
such as, you know,

137
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,170
Larry Page and all of these
people are all great people,

138
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:22,860
but there are not us. Like
it's just different, you know,

139
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,310
it's not the same.
And um,

140
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:29,840
and this book came about from my view of,

141
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,150
I think there's so many
amazing women out there,

142
00:08:32,151 --> 00:08:35,360
cause I've had them speak
at my events that, you know,

143
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:38,600
we didn't need to share more content
and we also need to share more authentic

144
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:42,710
content. Um, not me going
out and interviewing people,

145
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:46,550
which I could have done, but another train
journal, I don't even know what to ask.

146
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:51,020
Basically. I can answer
questions, but you know, um,

147
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,380
so that's why I came up with the idea
of writing a letter because I think it's

148
00:08:55,381 --> 00:08:59,800
kind of, it's quite a powerful tool.
Yeah. Um, and also it digs out, you know,

149
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:04,440
pass it insights from those entrepreneurs
that they probably would have never

150
00:09:04,441 --> 00:09:08,280
been prompted by a journalist.
Right. Because who knows
what's in your head. Right.

151
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:12,060
So, yeah. So that's the long
story to how this came about.

152
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,470
And when you collecting all this success,

153
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,000
six different letters
from the female founders,

154
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,240
is there any particular one like you,

155
00:09:21,241 --> 00:09:23,550
like most impress you
the most or something?

156
00:09:23,551 --> 00:09:26,880
You never expect it as a question?
Ask a lot.

157
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:31,200
So there are 66 letter in that
book, so there's quite a few, um,

158
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:32,910
amazing women.
And so they have that,

159
00:09:32,911 --> 00:09:37,830
that got featured and I have several
favorites was different reasons.

160
00:09:37,831 --> 00:09:42,510
And I think, you know, people that
are just super practical and a,

161
00:09:42,511 --> 00:09:45,690
and just kind of like, you know, just when
you read this, you go, oh my God, you the,

162
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,710
of course, you know, like should
I should do this, you know,

163
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:52,320
and then people that are a
bit more reflective and uh,

164
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,300
and it takes a bit longer to process
basically. And sometimes, you know,

165
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,780
I mean even I had to like read,

166
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:00,510
I mean I had to read cause
I edited the whole thing,

167
00:10:00,511 --> 00:10:04,830
but I had to read letters several times
to, and I wanna understand what, what,

168
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,210
you know, what's behind. And,
uh, so yes, I mean I do have my,

169
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,370
my favorite letters, um, for
different reasons I think. And um,

170
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,530
if you probably sort of,

171
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,710
I mean I can probably say like
the first one of each chapter,

172
00:10:19,711 --> 00:10:24,500
I have three larger sections in the book.
Probably the first one that I put is,

173
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,950
was kind of like one of the favorites.

174
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:30,360
And the last one is quite powerful
as well actually. Yeah. Cool.

175
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:33,840
Can't wait to read the whole book. I
think you guys probably thinking the same.

176
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:38,550
Um, and when you, when
you funding your business,

177
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:43,380
do you find this at wise give you,
um, good reason to hold down to, uh,

178
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,970
have you ever experienced
some of the failures or, um,

179
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:51,780
time and how do you cope with the yeah,
I think that his business reality, right?

180
00:10:51,781 --> 00:10:55,080
I mean, if anybody thinks that, you
know, when you started your own business,

181
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,920
there's going to be eight to be like,
forget it. He's not going to happen.

182
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:04,080
So I mean, there's naturally up and downs
and, um, and then, you know, I mean,

183
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:08,880
I think sort of rooting
all of these articles and
letters. I think there's just,

184
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,490
you know, a lot of things that, that
is very real. And I think, you know,

185
00:11:12,491 --> 00:11:14,910
just one of the things,
I mean there's just springs to mind,

186
00:11:14,911 --> 00:11:17,760
but don't work with idiots. Yeah.
I mean, nobody tells you that,

187
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:22,480
but don't work with idiots. Very
simple. And, and it's, you know,

188
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,880
I say it's simple,
but it's actually not,

189
00:11:23,881 --> 00:11:26,520
because sometimes you aren't in situations
where you have to work with people

190
00:11:26,521 --> 00:11:30,060
that you actually don't like, for
example. And then, you know, it's,

191
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,830
it can drag a lot of energy and time out
of view. Um, and sometimes, you know,

192
00:11:34,831 --> 00:11:38,340
like the boldest move you can actually
make this actually stop working with

193
00:11:38,341 --> 00:11:42,420
these people, even if you have
to say no to money. Right. Um,

194
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:46,650
and cash flow is obviously
important, um, always. Um,

195
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,650
but sometimes it's just very deliberating
not, not to work with certain people.

196
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,720
Um, and, uh,

197
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,690
and I know that from the community and
obviously I produced the book for the

198
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,100
blooming founders community.

199
00:11:57,101 --> 00:12:00,280
I know that some people have it next to
their bedside table and then, you know,

200
00:12:00,281 --> 00:12:03,550
when they have like a shitty day, then
you know, oh, can I swear actually,

201
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:07,510
I don't know.
I'm the one they had like a bad day.

202
00:12:07,511 --> 00:12:10,690
They will sort of dip into the book and
then they would sort of be motivated

203
00:12:10,691 --> 00:12:15,160
again and said, etc. Um,
because you know, life happens.

204
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,740
That's true. Um, so when you,

205
00:12:17,741 --> 00:12:22,450
on your entrepreneurial journey,
there's, do you have mentors?

206
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,370
Do you have like good mentor that mentor?

207
00:12:24,371 --> 00:12:29,120
And how do you know at that time that's
a, it was for you. How do you know it?

208
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:31,840
So I think, I believe, I
mean, if you don't know,

209
00:12:31,841 --> 00:12:35,340
I think it's good to just type this into
a lot of a pin, different opinions. Um,

210
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:38,740
and then you had to just make yourself
like make up your mind yourself.

211
00:12:38,741 --> 00:12:42,730
Basically you have what you listened
to and, and just aligned with your gut.

212
00:12:42,731 --> 00:12:46,000
Like who do you trust most? Right? And you
know, cause most of the time you asked,

213
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:46,541
I mean,

214
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:50,260
don't listen to people who tell you
something and you actually find out that

215
00:12:50,261 --> 00:12:52,300
I've never done it
themselves. Right? I mean,

216
00:12:52,301 --> 00:12:57,050
we know too many of those people and
there's a lot of mentors and advisors also

217
00:12:57,051 --> 00:13:00,520
in the startup world that have never
done anything themselves, but then they,

218
00:13:00,521 --> 00:13:05,410
you know, are going around and
advising people. Right. And, um,

219
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:10,930
um, so that, be careful about, um,
and over time I think, you know,

220
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,770
the good mentors and advisors, they would
actually sort of follow up with you,

221
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:18,670
um, because they like you and
they really want to support you.

222
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:21,430
So with most of my current mentors,

223
00:13:21,431 --> 00:13:25,420
I wouldn't even call them mentors because
we almost became friends. Right? I mean,

224
00:13:25,421 --> 00:13:29,770
I have everyone on whatsapp and if I
have any questions basically, right.

225
00:13:29,771 --> 00:13:32,560
I just basically ping them a
message and then, you know,

226
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,900
I see what they say and then
I think, oh, this makes sense.

227
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:39,670
This doesn't make sense. Or, you
know, and then I just move on. Cool.

228
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:44,580
Um, I think I raised a research or
another interview date. There's,

229
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:49,240
in UK there's around 75%
of the female founder.

230
00:13:49,241 --> 00:13:53,440
They're also solo founders, so they don't
have cofounder and all by themselves.

231
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:54,663
Um,

232
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:59,940
what do you think can be done to change
the reality or what caused that and what

233
00:14:00,431 --> 00:14:01,264
things we can do?

234
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,770
So I think the reason expands is probably
not that easy to explain. I mean,

235
00:14:05,771 --> 00:14:08,500
there's multitudes of, of of things.
I mean there's research, for example,

236
00:14:08,501 --> 00:14:13,501
that women in business and in general
have a smaller network but a deeper

237
00:14:14,111 --> 00:14:17,620
network and men and business have a
water network and more shallow network,

238
00:14:17,621 --> 00:14:19,630
which means that they know the space,
the more people.

239
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:24,630
And then societal lead also men tend
to not shy away from is picking up the

240
00:14:26,081 --> 00:14:29,350
phone and call up a mate to ask them
a favor or to ask him to do something.

241
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:33,760
Whereas women tend not to
do that basically because
they're aware it's risky and

242
00:14:33,761 --> 00:14:37,240
I don't really want to drag another friend
into like the whole thing before they

243
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:41,620
are 100% certain. It's perfect and
it's totally, you know, you know,

244
00:14:41,621 --> 00:14:46,540
safe to do, which obviously is never
is. And um, yeah, so I think, you know,

245
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,780
a lot of women in the community
to me as you know, um,

246
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:55,000
our solo founders because
they choose that path of x,

247
00:14:55,001 --> 00:14:59,300
y that reason could be because they were
frustrated in the previous job because

248
00:14:59,301 --> 00:15:02,300
they're really passionate about,
you know, this idea that they have.

249
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:06,320
But they are,
they at that time when they had the idea,

250
00:15:06,321 --> 00:15:11,240
there was nobody else around that was
similarly passionate or that they knew for

251
00:15:11,241 --> 00:15:14,390
long enough to kind of be a
cofounder. Yeah. But then, you know,

252
00:15:14,391 --> 00:15:17,890
sort of people venture out and then they
try to find a cofounding team and that

253
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,310
becomes really difficult as well because
you don't obviously know the people and

254
00:15:22,311 --> 00:15:27,260
then, you know, people might take
advantage of you and all of these things.

255
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:32,261
So I think it's a multitude of reasons
why women tend to build businesses on

256
00:15:34,881 --> 00:15:39,560
their own. Um, set this though,
you know, I mean, luckily
we still have, um, you know,

257
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,510
women founding teams,

258
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:45,380
the no mixed teams as well
that built great businesses.

259
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:48,800
But I think the overall sort
of landscape is, unfortunately,

260
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:52,850
I'm still that way and I hope through
the, you know, the work that we do.

261
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:55,820
So we recently opened,
um, the physical space,

262
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:58,280
a physical work and events
space called Bloom's London.

263
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:01,640
So it's a coworking space slash
event space slash members club.

264
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:05,180
And I think the members club element
comes through bringing the community

265
00:16:05,181 --> 00:16:10,160
together. Right. I'm connecting you
with other women, um, that do, you know,

266
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,330
I see similar things in business
but have different businesses, um,

267
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,580
and you can collaborate and then,
you know,

268
00:16:16,581 --> 00:16:21,030
you can form teams that
might not be sitting on the
one company but at least are

269
00:16:21,031 --> 00:16:23,150
sort of like, you know,
associated in a, in a way.

270
00:16:23,151 --> 00:16:24,500
So you're not working on your own.

271
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,330
So maybe slash lay outside the
topic, you know, incorporate,

272
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:33,410
we're always talking about what life
balance. We have yoga, we have lunch here.

273
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,810
Once you become an entrepreneur and
you used to be in this environment,

274
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,050
how do you adjust yourself and
how do you keep the balance?

275
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,950
I think balance is another
interesting question. I should,

276
00:16:44,951 --> 00:16:47,360
I think balance is a personal choice.
Um,

277
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:52,450
I think everybody has needs to get to
know their own bodies better and you know,

278
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,990
understand are you a morning person?
Are you a night person? Are you,

279
00:16:56,991 --> 00:17:01,610
what personality are you normal,
regular, working hours person. Um,

280
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,360
and what do you need in your
life basically? Right? So
when I left the corporate,

281
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,480
um, what I've done and I could
have wiped out my schedule,

282
00:17:08,481 --> 00:17:12,350
like nine to five or whatever and also
Monday to Friday cause I had seven days

283
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,820
in the week. And, um, and I'm not sure
if you, you probably know like this, I'm

284
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,970
sure what it was, but
you know, like this, um,

285
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:24,590
there's this story about this professor
in a university and he comes up with

286
00:17:24,591 --> 00:17:28,310
like these two vases and like stones and
sand and then he talks to the students

287
00:17:28,311 --> 00:17:31,730
about, I think it's about time management
or something. And you put in like,

288
00:17:31,731 --> 00:17:34,010
you know, the stones and
the days and then I'm sorry,

289
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:37,130
the sand into the vase and then the
stones and it doesn't fit basically,

290
00:17:37,131 --> 00:17:40,680
that have overflows. And then he
puts the stones first and then, um,

291
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:44,090
the sand around it and then
everything's fits perfectly.

292
00:17:44,091 --> 00:17:46,160
And I think that was the analogy around,
you know,

293
00:17:46,161 --> 00:17:48,440
making sure you put the
priority. Like, you know,

294
00:17:48,441 --> 00:17:53,280
like you will the priorities in check
and you know, your ducks in a row.

295
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:57,600
But I think that's what I've pretty
much done with my schedule with my time.

296
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,920
So I wiped everything out and I say, okay,
I need to sleep like seven hours a day.

297
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,480
So where do I plug that in?

298
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:06,450
I actually tend to sleep between
one and eight for example.

299
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:11,370
And I work the best actually between 10
and one cause that's like my quiet time.

300
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:16,140
Um, I proud of that in
then. You know, friends,

301
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:20,580
I see them for brunch or drinks or
whatever, like to call my mom, you know,

302
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,020
all of these things basically that.
Um, but somehow actually I read this,

303
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:27,840
I had a really simple lives.
I don't have that many stones to Putin,

304
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,480
which as a result, the rest
basically it was basic, you know,

305
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,810
sand for me and my businesses
stand basically. Right.

306
00:18:36,811 --> 00:18:41,310
It's kind of everything else that,
that I create in my life. And, um,

307
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,650
and that's my definition
of work life balance,

308
00:18:43,651 --> 00:18:46,800
because if there's anything
in a stolen coming right,

309
00:18:46,801 --> 00:18:48,300
I mean I would visit to make,

310
00:18:48,301 --> 00:18:52,590
to make that stone sort of work somehow
and just remove the sound a little bit.

311
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:56,220
Right. Um, yeah. So that's good.

312
00:18:56,530 --> 00:19:01,290
Oh yeah. I'll ask one more question
and I'll open up to the floor.

313
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:05,310
The Googlers are really good with
questions. Just be prepared. Um,

314
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:10,140
so what advice would you give to
funders out there? It doesn't matter,

315
00:19:10,141 --> 00:19:13,750
male or female. What do you do
say to, I would actually say like,

316
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:17,190
the advice that you find in this book
is applicable to everybody, right?

317
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:21,750
I mean it just comes from a
female perspective because
that person happens to be

318
00:19:21,751 --> 00:19:24,930
a woman. Um, but, uh,

319
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,620
I think my general advice is to do it,

320
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:31,750
to explore whether
entrepreneurship is for you. Um,

321
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,890
there's literally nothing to lose.
I mean, if you think, I mean,

322
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:37,560
maybe it was a bit of money,
fine. I mean, you can, you know,

323
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,070
dawn another company and
or money again, right? Um,

324
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,260
but you know,

325
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:47,970
like the time is not lost because you
learn so much and it's so different

326
00:19:47,971 --> 00:19:50,250
actually to how corporate life works.

327
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,920
And you also get to know
yourself actually a lot better.

328
00:19:52,921 --> 00:19:56,710
So I think entrepreneurship, you know,
is a really good way to get, you know,

329
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:00,480
like too for personal development.
And, um, and you know,

330
00:20:00,481 --> 00:20:04,110
some people succeed,
great, some people don't,

331
00:20:04,111 --> 00:20:07,320
but then they realize actually, you
know, I don't have to build a business.

332
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,700
I'm actually much more happier.

333
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:12,570
Cause sometimes you don't know what you
have until you actually get rid of it

334
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,340
and like loser basically.
Right.

335
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:19,410
And some people actually I know are
very happy but in a job and still do,

336
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,920
you know what they did on the side as
a hobby basically. But then at least,

337
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:26,280
you know, you feel a lot more
comfortable and at ease that, you know,

338
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:30,750
this is how I want to design my life now.
Right. I mean it's not a constant, um,

339
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:36,330
state I would say. Yeah,
exactly. Oh yeah. Great.

340
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:39,510
So now over up to the floor,
if you have questions,

341
00:20:39,511 --> 00:20:43,050
just raise your hand and I'll give you
a microphone. So we'll start from there.

342
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:48,280
Tell me about the process
of writing the book, uh,

343
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,570
in terms of selecting the,
the, the, the founder's Eh,

344
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,500
how you pitch it,

345
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:56,770
how you convinced them to separate a time
to write these really intimate later.

346
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,820
You gave them a deadline. Did you have
to do much chasing? Tell us a bit.

347
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:01,910
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

348
00:21:01,911 --> 00:21:06,350
So it took me about nine months from
having the idea to actually holding the

349
00:21:06,351 --> 00:21:09,650
book in my and my hands. So it's,
it's self published through Amazon.

350
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:13,760
Everybody can self publish
a book. Um, and uh,

351
00:21:13,761 --> 00:21:18,470
so took me in total nine month and, um,
I started with the women that I know,

352
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,860
the new, uh, that I have
invited to speak at my events.

353
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:26,360
And I think the criteria was that
they had to be, you know, um,

354
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:30,080
they must have achieved something
interesting, basically insignificant.

355
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:35,000
So I had like, they had to be in business
for at least three years and a ideally,

356
00:21:35,001 --> 00:21:35,331
you know,

357
00:21:35,331 --> 00:21:40,130
there's many like employees or race
that much funding or have generated this

358
00:21:40,131 --> 00:21:42,820
much revenue. So all
of the 66, altogether,

359
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:47,750
they've generated $1 billion
in revenue. Right. And some,

360
00:21:47,751 --> 00:21:50,970
obviously more than others,
but you know, and uh, yeah.

361
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:55,010
So I leverage my own personal
network. Then I have, um,

362
00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:00,020
ask them basically to kind of refer me to
other women because, you know, it's, uh,

363
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:00,450
you know,

364
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:04,040
it's a small group of four or five
pills or then people tend to know other

365
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:08,750
people. Um, I have also,
um, reached out through,

366
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:13,310
you know, the Google network,
like the accelerator networks,

367
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,310
a startup weekend.

368
00:22:14,311 --> 00:22:17,060
So I volunteer for something or we can
organize or weekends and so we can,

369
00:22:17,061 --> 00:22:22,061
as around the globe and that I utilized
after I have pretty much gotten like,

370
00:22:22,281 --> 00:22:22,431
you know,

371
00:22:22,431 --> 00:22:27,170
20 people like in around London and the
u s which I provide the first people you

372
00:22:27,171 --> 00:22:29,960
get because it's kind of like, you
know, the, the density is there,

373
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:33,560
but I really wanted to have a global
perspective. Do you have people from,

374
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:37,070
you know, New Zealand,
China, you know, and um,

375
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,860
Columbia and Mexico and, and, and things.

376
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:43,900
So for that I had to use sort of like
top to other networks and started working

377
00:22:43,901 --> 00:22:48,720
with amazing. That works.
So, um, you know, everybody's
like so helpful and you know,

378
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,870
helping you to connect. And, uh,

379
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:55,550
also my business school friends because
they are everywhere in the world now.

380
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,960
So from near Dubai to Indonesia to like
everyone's a bit like a high, you know,

381
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:04,430
and um, and so that's how I
have reached out. I think the,

382
00:23:04,431 --> 00:23:06,680
I also tried linkedin
and just like Linkedin,

383
00:23:06,681 --> 00:23:10,750
like connections and messages
that was like the least effective,

384
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,570
but I called a couple
third that, um, yeah.

385
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:16,240
And how we'll approach
them was actually I,

386
00:23:16,241 --> 00:23:20,390
so I actually wrote a letter
myself as a example. Right.

387
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:24,860
And I gave them quiet,
um, specific. So the f um,

388
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:26,390
I suppose directions,
right?

389
00:23:26,391 --> 00:23:29,420
So it started with DFMO founder cause
that's the title of the book and

390
00:23:29,421 --> 00:23:30,770
everything.
Start with the female founder.

391
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,700
It has to be between 500
and a thousand, not, sorry,

392
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,830
800 and 1,500 words. So it also
communicates, it's not too long.

393
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:43,910
Yeah. You're not asking him to write
like a book, but just a letter.

394
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:48,200
And, um, and, and basically
just think about, you know,

395
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,060
if you were to sit down
and write a letter,

396
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,450
what would you advise to your
younger self or, you know,

397
00:23:53,451 --> 00:23:56,660
your best friend who was starting
a business and, and, and,

398
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,090
or the future generation
of female founders. Right.

399
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:04,220
And I think that idea has resonated a
lot with the people that contributed,

400
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:07,700
that everybody was just so happy to
do it. And they were like, oh my God,

401
00:24:07,701 --> 00:24:10,820
I always wanted to do that. It's like,
good that you're giving me the chance,

402
00:24:10,821 --> 00:24:11,654
you know?
And,

403
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:16,780
and I got actually a lot of gratitude
from people because people were like,

404
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,681
actually,
you know,

405
00:24:18,681 --> 00:24:23,030
thank you for helping me to find my
voice and my story and to tell my story

406
00:24:23,031 --> 00:24:26,390
because I've never done that
before because I was never
asked because that comes

407
00:24:26,391 --> 00:24:31,220
with it over Israel problem because
they were never ask. Right. Um,

408
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:35,100
so yeah. So I think somehow, I think
the idea just resonates it. Um,

409
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:39,590
pretty much everybody had a positive
response. Um, probably hotter people.

410
00:24:39,591 --> 00:24:44,330
I've contacted well conduct around
like 150 people. Um, so it's lovely.

411
00:24:44,331 --> 00:24:48,350
I would love to contribute, but I'm so
super busy that I just don't have time.

412
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,740
But you know, let me know
when it's out. And, um,

413
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,860
I would love to support and spreading
the word or something. Um, yeah.

414
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:01,070
Cool. So just go, do they also post it to
you like writing and stamp? No, no, no.

415
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:05,810
Oh yeah. So Google box guys. Yeah. So,

416
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,060
um, yeah, no, it's to be
honest, like the, the actual,

417
00:25:08,061 --> 00:25:11,210
my work was really just project
management cause he was just, you know,

418
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,810
you quit your hit list, you contact
them, you see what they say, right.

419
00:25:14,811 --> 00:25:16,940
Does everything in excel or Google sheets.

420
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,780
And then literally I would just ask
people to send me a Google doc. Right.

421
00:25:20,781 --> 00:25:21,614
And then we would,

422
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:26,010
I would edit it in the Google doc with
them and every letter before we had like,

423
00:25:26,011 --> 00:25:30,690
you know, between three to
five, sort of like rounds of,

424
00:25:30,691 --> 00:25:35,000
of um, feedback and then, um, and
that's it. Right. Just sign off.

425
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:39,670
That's the text.
You copy it further and that's not good.

426
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:45,220
Thanks. Thanks for sharing your
story. Um, so you mentioned that, uh,

427
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,240
the letters are from sort of
a global base. Yes. So you,

428
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:52,210
you spoke to people and had contributions
from all over the world. Um,

429
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:57,570
what proportion of the letters were
from sort of the US versus Europe versus

430
00:25:57,571 --> 00:26:01,500
Asia in general?
And did you notice any trends,

431
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:05,880
like themes of different
types of challenges that
people faced in North America

432
00:26:05,881 --> 00:26:08,790
versus what perhaps they faced
here or, or in Apac? Okay,

433
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:13,290
so I think around, I forgot
the numbers, to be honest. Uh,

434
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:18,150
around 2020 people are
actually from the UK.

435
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:22,650
Another like 15 or so
are from the u s so like,

436
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:26,580
probably half of the book
is kind of UK, u s. Um,

437
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,670
and then the rest is kind of
like across the globe. Right.

438
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:33,240
And at some one I would just literally
keen on having somebody in Africa,

439
00:26:33,241 --> 00:26:37,560
for example. Um, and yeah,

440
00:26:37,561 --> 00:26:40,520
and I think in terms of the
advice that the people, I mean,

441
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:43,980
I also had like entrepreneurs
[inaudible] stuff in Sierra Leone,

442
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:48,600
but we're actually Americans, for example.
Right. So it's a bit, you know, um,

443
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:50,130
but I think in terms of advice,

444
00:26:50,131 --> 00:26:53,520
I think it really depends more on the
type of business and the industry that

445
00:26:53,521 --> 00:26:58,450
they were in. Then the actual
country. I do see business,

446
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,450
you know, in the, in the
agents that have like sphere,

447
00:27:00,451 --> 00:27:04,590
there is more cultural
expectations, um, around, uh,

448
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:08,340
around topic of entrepreneurship because
it's not something that women do to be

449
00:27:08,341 --> 00:27:12,170
honest. Um, and uh, and then in, in terms,

450
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:14,190
and it's funny cause I think the,

451
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:18,360
the girl from Latin America within
lady actually, she's a scientist,

452
00:27:18,361 --> 00:27:21,550
she's like heavy, heavy
like science stuff. Um,

453
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:26,220
she kind of was, um, was
interesting because she's like,

454
00:27:26,221 --> 00:27:27,870
she doing as like super serious thing.

455
00:27:27,871 --> 00:27:31,170
And then like her letter was kind of
like really bubbly, like, you know,

456
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:33,870
so that's what I felt that you
and the way that she was writing,

457
00:27:33,871 --> 00:27:37,740
that's the other Latin American sort
of flavor came out in a little bit. Um,

458
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:40,790
but that's just kind of like, you know,
for, from an editing perspective, um,

459
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,230
from a content perspective,

460
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:48,530
I would say I was surprised to see that
probably only like five to maximum 10%

461
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:52,720
of what people talk
about is actually gender.

462
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:57,280
Genderized is actually sort of about like,
oh, as a female founder, Dah, Dah, Dah,

463
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,530
Dah, Dah, Dah. Like most of the things
are really just super, you know,

464
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:03,120
applicable across everything.
So I think,

465
00:28:03,121 --> 00:28:06,700
and I found that quite
interesting because, you know,
I didn't give them a bit,

466
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,000
a more specific brief and then I shared
with you just now and people were not,

467
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:17,100
you know, um, oh my God,
I'm a female founder, I'm so
discriminated and you know,

468
00:28:17,101 --> 00:28:21,360
the word is so horrible, you know,
I mean, you obviously have that,

469
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,160
but in the grand scheme of things,

470
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:25,800
I think probably also people just don't
want to share that back to the future

471
00:28:25,801 --> 00:28:30,570
generation. Right. I think,
you know, we, we, we want to
be more positive, um, about,

472
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:34,010
about entrepreneurship. Yeah. Yeah.

473
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,970
As you,
as you've mentioned that we as as women,

474
00:28:37,971 --> 00:28:41,310
we don't have as many role
models in terms of CEOs. Uh,

475
00:28:41,311 --> 00:28:42,770
there are female out there.

476
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:46,700
I was just wondering if there were any
common topics in the book and the letters,

477
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,540
um,

478
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:51,560
about women feeling a bit
like the imposter syndrome
and Google sometimes they

479
00:28:51,561 --> 00:28:55,400
talk about, oh my, I'm not sure if I
should be here if I deserve to be here.

480
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:59,570
So I'm just wondering with women being
CEOs if there they talked about anything

481
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,940
about,
I cannot believe I'm a CEO

482
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:06,470
or things like that they did.
There they do. And I think, um,

483
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:07,520
what did come out,

484
00:29:07,521 --> 00:29:12,521
I think what makes a difference at women
wrote those letters is a little bit of

485
00:29:12,921 --> 00:29:15,040
that, but a lot of about, um,

486
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,340
taking care of yourself kind of thing
and being true to yourself and not,

487
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,120
you know, trying to do
something just because the rest
of the world wants you to,

488
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:27,950
to do it right. So for example, I'm in
a typical startup acceleration phase.

489
00:29:27,951 --> 00:29:31,310
As you know, you, you, you
know, you start a startup, you
get like, see, like, you know,

490
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:34,370
you go through an accelerator,
you get your seed funding,

491
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:39,020
you get your series a and B in
another and so forth, right? And, um,

492
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:43,660
and it requires a certain of business
to do that and actually sort of perform

493
00:29:43,661 --> 00:29:44,920
against all of these metrics,

494
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:49,090
but it might not be the best business and
it might not be the best miss this for

495
00:29:49,091 --> 00:29:53,200
you as well. Right? So
people pivot, right? And then
sometime it's kind of like,

496
00:29:53,201 --> 00:29:53,411
you know,

497
00:29:53,411 --> 00:29:57,670
am I doing the wrong thing of having
graduated from a Texas accelerator for

498
00:29:57,671 --> 00:30:02,290
example, and now pivoting into
an agency for example, right?

499
00:30:02,291 --> 00:30:05,260
That might be super profitable because
we were really good at what we're doing,

500
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:09,970
but isn't the high growth tech business
that people thought that we were doing

501
00:30:09,971 --> 00:30:13,990
in the beginning. Right. And
I think letting go and, and,
and sort of like, you know,

502
00:30:13,991 --> 00:30:18,430
sort of that type of
attachment. Um, you can, uh,

503
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,750
like read a little bit through, through
the book and, and also then, you know,

504
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:25,870
attached to like, it's, it's, you know,
it's very stressful obviously, um,

505
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:30,340
to just be okay with yourself to say,
okay,

506
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:31,893
you know,

507
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:36,430
I am in that game or I am in a different
game and I'm totally fine with being in

508
00:30:36,431 --> 00:30:41,210
a different game. Right. And, and to the
south, the imposter syndrome thing. Um,

509
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:45,800
so that's actually in the first letter
written by a lady called Alex. Uh,

510
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:49,990
Alex on a deep latch from
hospital commentary exited
hustle couple of years ago

511
00:30:49,991 --> 00:30:53,870
and now she's building her second
startup hub bill path. And um,

512
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,091
she has like,

513
00:30:55,091 --> 00:30:59,560
one of her tips for that is when you
sort of have a important meeting,

514
00:30:59,561 --> 00:31:02,950
important presentation,
you go to the bathroom,

515
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:07,750
you look into the mirror and you say,
I am the shit to yourself,

516
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:11,830
right? And then you go back
up and then it's all good.

517
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:17,140
So things like that, you know. Cool.

518
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:20,350
So what is the next
step for you from there?

519
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:24,700
So you know what the book was
literally something, I mean,

520
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:27,640
I didn't have any motives behind the
book to be honest. Right? I mean,

521
00:31:27,641 --> 00:31:28,930
I published it because I've,

522
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:32,770
I felt the content was needed and then
I was engaging with the community at the

523
00:31:32,771 --> 00:31:33,850
time.
So for me,

524
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:36,360
I'm obviously super happy to promote the
book all the time because I think it's,

525
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:41,170
it's valuable content, um,
to share. But, um, you know,

526
00:31:41,171 --> 00:31:43,150
I'm not Simon Sinek basically.
Right? There was like, no,

527
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:46,600
like gigantic other thing that is
kind of like coming behind the book is

528
00:31:46,601 --> 00:31:51,040
literally just kind of like, you know,
for the universe really. And, uh,

529
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:54,730
so my business is around building this
infrastructure for female founders. Right.

530
00:31:54,731 --> 00:31:57,220
And the book is obviously one
element is one product that you can,

531
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:01,630
that you can get. And, and
the other product that, the,

532
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:05,290
the thing that I want to
scale is, um, you know,

533
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:09,430
this online to offline
sort of infrastructure that
includes the online community

534
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:14,260
where you can make connections and, um,
you know, share knowledge and experiences.

535
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:19,450
Plus then sort of seeing everybody in
real life in those coworking spaces that

536
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:23,830
I'm creating. Right. So, so that's
kind of like, you know, sort of the,

537
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,190
the business that I'm
looking to build and a,

538
00:32:27,191 --> 00:32:30,420
at the moment we have the
first one in all street. Um,

539
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:34,390
and we're looking to kind of, you know,
then grow that and open more spaces.

540
00:32:34,391 --> 00:32:36,850
And in west London,
um,

541
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:40,160
I'm actually thinking
about Bali because why not?

542
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:45,800
Who doesn't want to work in
Bali and other locations. Yeah.

543
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:52,390
We're going to do one more
question and then, yeah. Cool.

544
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:58,670
Hi Lou. Thank you for joining.
This is truly amazing.

545
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:01,790
It's something that I would dream to
publish, but I'm glad you beat me to it.

546
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:06,830
The question I have for you is for there
anyone or any founders that you reached

547
00:33:06,831 --> 00:33:08,720
out to where you thought,
you know,

548
00:33:08,721 --> 00:33:12,350
they might never respond and when they
did you were kind of nervous or like,

549
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:14,450
oh my God,
they actually responded

550
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,530
like a Sheryl Sandberg or,
yeah, it doesn't matter.

551
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:23,760
I try to [inaudible] stole sandbar
but didn't go far enough I suppose.

552
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:28,890
Um, I think, I don't know,

553
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:32,160
it's a difficult question
to answer because

554
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:33,890
yeah,

555
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:35,360
I though positive,

556
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:39,350
honestly thing that every woman who has
achieved something almost has a moral

557
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:42,440
obligation to do that.
So therefore, you know,

558
00:33:42,441 --> 00:33:46,550
I think that when people responded
positively, I was like, yes, you got it.

559
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:52,030
Awesome. Let's do this. Right.
Like I wasn't me, like, hold
on, call. She accepted it.

560
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:56,600
This is so amazing. You
know, it's, I, it's fine. You
know, I mean it's, it's, um,

561
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:00,890
I think, um, yeah, because
I know in that way,

562
00:34:00,891 --> 00:34:04,810
I mean I felt a bit and title,
does that make sense? And the,

563
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,760
in a non sort of like, oh no, I think
just got to do this kind of thing.

564
00:34:07,761 --> 00:34:10,550
But I actually genuinely think that that,
you know,

565
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:15,200
successful people have a moral obligation
to, to share their knowledge with,

566
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:17,420
with the future generation.

567
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:22,690
So I was generally happy that they
got it and they didn't know they were

568
00:34:22,971 --> 00:34:27,590
supporting me on, on that
journey. And, um, and I think, um,

569
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:30,620
I was also kind of, I think what I was
surprised about is actually the, the,

570
00:34:30,621 --> 00:34:32,360
the surrounding support,
right.

571
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:36,740
So one thing I forgot to
mention is actually I also
had a nomination process to

572
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,410
find interesting,
um,

573
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:43,070
women and a lot of people actually use
that actually because sometimes you don't

574
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:45,560
know the woman yourself,
but you know,

575
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,650
their previous pa or the
marketing manager or you know,

576
00:34:48,651 --> 00:34:51,230
is now like a female founder herself.
And then she knows me.

577
00:34:51,231 --> 00:34:54,800
So she would sort of like,
you know, suggest her previous
boss and, and, and, and,

578
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:59,120
and stuff like that. So that I
actually felt, um, it was really nice,

579
00:34:59,121 --> 00:35:03,200
but that got me, was like, oh, sweet,
exciting. I didn't know you were doing,

580
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:06,950
you know, so, so, yeah. Cool. Great.

581
00:35:06,951 --> 00:35:11,600
So thank you Lou leaf of sharing the
experience and the book and thank you

582
00:35:11,601 --> 00:35:14,780
everyone for coming and all the good
question. I hope you guys enjoy the book.

583
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:18,860
Feel free to maybe ask a Luli
afterwards for a few questions.

584
00:35:18,861 --> 00:35:22,190
Sign the book if you won. So,
yeah, see you guys next time.

585
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:23,460
Thanks.
