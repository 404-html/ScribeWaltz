1
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:10,690
I'm really excited to welcome
my dear friend, a mentor
now, like align to Google.

2
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,130
So happy to be here. My God, it's

3
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:19,840
uh, Nellie's really, I truly
a force to be reckoned with.

4
00:00:19,841 --> 00:00:22,480
She's one of the first Latina
producers in Hollywood,

5
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,920
former president of
entertainment at the [inaudible].

6
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,750
She is the Latina Tyler Perry.

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,040
She's got a day and a
really excited today.

8
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:36,040
She's a media mogul and on
a mission to empower others.

9
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:38,380
And so I want to take
a chance if it works,

10
00:00:38,381 --> 00:00:42,160
we're going to play a little sizzle reel
that will just tell us more about her

11
00:00:42,161 --> 00:00:47,160
journey. So really important for
us to show that because again,

12
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,720
I would not be able to do a
Nellie's journey justice, uh,

13
00:00:51,721 --> 00:00:56,040
in terms of all that you've accomplished.
So, uh, that collection of your stories,

14
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,360
absolutely amazing.

15
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,550
And what we're here to talk and to talk
about today is self made. So it's a,

16
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,570
her entrepreneurship manifesto that
is a New York Times best seller. Um,

17
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,220
so really applaud you for that because
there are how many Latinos that are

18
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,000
bestsellers

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,840
for Latinas histories and three
of them are dead celebrities.

20
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,300
And I think we have to understand that
the New York Times is a big and be having

21
00:01:21,301 --> 00:01:25,530
a New York Times bestseller is very
hard to do a, you have to sell x amount,

22
00:01:25,531 --> 00:01:27,420
you know, so many books.
It's a lot of books.

23
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,520
And so we have to be able to buy things
in mass together to reach those numbers.

24
00:01:32,521 --> 00:01:32,790
Right.

25
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,080
For me it was like climbing
Mount Kilimanjaro and very
important to me because

26
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,370
how thought leaders are made in
America are through the New York Times

27
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,210
bestseller.

28
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:47,210
I have to say that the day that I met you
and Indiana who I love her from Google

29
00:01:47,431 --> 00:01:48,850
as well.
Um,

30
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,700
we had an event together with women of
Silicon Valley with Sheryl Sandberg.

31
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,630
And then I had you ladies
because I was so proud of you.

32
00:01:57,631 --> 00:02:00,180
I said I felt like a
proud mother to see you.

33
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:03,010
How beautiful and smart and I was just,

34
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:07,250
I mean he laid it to have you and that's
the day that I decided to write self

35
00:02:07,251 --> 00:02:10,680
made. Wow. Because Sheryl Sandberg and I,

36
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,450
she had asked me to do an event.

37
00:02:12,451 --> 00:02:16,290
She knew that I have a big constituency
of Latina multicultural women.

38
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,660
She wanted to do an event for lean in.

39
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,900
And I had a very long talk with
her before and I said, Cheryl,

40
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,520
I'm happy to do this event with you,

41
00:02:23,521 --> 00:02:28,260
but you have to understand that the book
is not that relatable to multicultural

42
00:02:28,261 --> 00:02:32,370
women. So many of us have had
paths that are not linear. Right.

43
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,270
And she was, she was wonderful. And
you know, we had, you were there,

44
00:02:36,271 --> 00:02:40,140
we had a very feisty conversation
about it and I'm a big fan of hers.

45
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:44,430
But that day I thought to myself
as she was speaking, I thought,

46
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:45,900
who's going to tell our stories?

47
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,850
Who's going to tell the stories of women
like us that are immigrants or the kids

48
00:02:50,851 --> 00:02:55,851
of immigrants or who have had detours
or women that are Muslim or African

49
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,880
American or Asian who really come to
this country and reinvent themselves and

50
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:04,660
are emerging in countries around the
world. And I heard in my ear, you do it,

51
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,890
you do it. And then of course sometimes
our low self esteem shows up and goes,

52
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:12,640
can't take it. I skipped the
way it is. What do you think
you are? And then I said,

53
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,560
if you don't do it,
who's going to do it?

54
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,300
And I and I did it and I'm very
proud that I've spent a year,

55
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,480
140 cities around the country meeting all
kinds of women and really uniting with

56
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:29,110
not just all multicultural women,
go with white women realizing that,

57
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:33,400
and we now know after the whole election
that this is an incredible year for all

58
00:03:33,401 --> 00:03:38,320
of us and that we need to talk
about this issue. A lot of power,

59
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,240
power that we don't even know we have now.
Tell us what is self made?

60
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:45,790
What does it mean to be self made?
So self made?

61
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:49,780
It's so wonderful to be in a tech company
and talk about self made because it

62
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:53,080
doesn't mean you're going to leave your
job and go be an entrepreneur tomorrow.

63
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,950
It also doesn't mean that especially
all of you in Silicon Valley,

64
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:00,910
that one of you is going to go off
and be the next Zuckerberg. You know,

65
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:03,520
these are one in a million situations.

66
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,640
But the good news is sub meters a mindset.

67
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:12,130
It begins by thinking like
an owner in what you do now.

68
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,660
You're not going to leave your job.

69
00:04:13,661 --> 00:04:16,990
You're going to think every
day that you're in business
school working for other

70
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:20,440
people, using other people's money and
sitting there every day and saying,

71
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,020
if this were my company,
what would I do?

72
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,820
Would I spend this money and make sure
that you let your bosses know how you

73
00:04:27,821 --> 00:04:28,600
feel.

74
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,370
You're practicing being an a founder
and an owner and if they don't listen to

75
00:04:33,371 --> 00:04:34,204
you,
that's fine,

76
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,410
but you have to every day come
into work not thinking victimized,

77
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:39,760
thinking like an owner.

78
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:44,170
The future for all of us is to
think and behave like owners.

79
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:49,710
Then we have to think that self made
is a mindset and it's a mindset of

80
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,340
understanding that the United States
works on a premise that most of us don't

81
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:58,120
know. The premise is that to
make it to the end of your life,

82
00:04:58,121 --> 00:05:01,630
you have to make money while you sleep.
Which one?

83
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:05,640
One of my billionaire bosses and
mentors told me that I was like, you're,

84
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,020
it sounds like a foreign language.
I didn't even know what that meant.

85
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:13,450
That meant that the money
you make at whatever job you
do, whether you work here,

86
00:05:13,451 --> 00:05:14,980
whether you're a doctor or a lawyer,

87
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,070
if you just count on the money
you make and the money you save,

88
00:05:18,071 --> 00:05:19,900
you're not going to make
it to the end of your life.

89
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:23,740
So entrepreneurship isn't just
becoming a founder or a maker,

90
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,920
it's also being someone that makes money,
saves money.

91
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:31,480
Sometimes you have to do it by starting
a side hustle and that money you save,

92
00:05:31,481 --> 00:05:35,830
you have to invest in like me real estate,
which we'll talk about.

93
00:05:35,831 --> 00:05:40,510
That's why I said don't buy shoes by
buildings or invested in stock or invested

94
00:05:40,511 --> 00:05:44,470
in buying an existing business and let
other people run it while you have a job

95
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,140
or supplier diversity where you understand
that there's a lot of contracts in

96
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:55,141
corporations and in the government that
are ear marked for women particularly

97
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:59,180
and multicultural specifically.
And guys,

98
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:02,600
if you want to make money partner with
a woman and a multicultural woman and

99
00:06:02,601 --> 00:06:05,330
you'll do better that we understand that.

100
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:08,000
Whether you're an entrepreneur
that leaves your company or not,

101
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,770
you must think entrepreneurial
entrepreneurially from
this moment on in your

102
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:16,310
life to make it tell us,
tell us about it,

103
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:20,240
Nelly at age 12 where did this come from?

104
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:23,900
When did you become self made? When did
you get this entrepreneurial spirit?

105
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:29,020
I think for me it all began in the
seventh grade. I think for so many of us,

106
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,520
sometimes our greatness comes from pain.
I was the kid of immigrants.

107
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:37,900
We had no money. My parents came from
communist Cuba. They lost everything,

108
00:06:37,901 --> 00:06:42,250
including their degrees. They had to
start all over. I became the hero child.

109
00:06:42,251 --> 00:06:44,890
I had to help them translate for them,
do everything.

110
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:49,580
And in the seventh grade we were having
a lot of money financially for our

111
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,650
struggles.
Financially.

112
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,610
I was an all girl Catholic school and uh,

113
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,120
basically I would overhear my parents
saying, what are we going to do?

114
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:02,950
What are we going to do? My father and
my mother would say, Cameron was, I said,

115
00:07:02,951 --> 00:07:05,440
and my dad say, don't
worry, Jesus will help us.

116
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,640
And I realized that I had
to go help my parents out.

117
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:14,470
And a lady down the street,
an older Jewish lady sold
Avon. And she's like, honey,

118
00:07:14,471 --> 00:07:17,560
why don't you sell Avon and you
get some free lipstick? I go,

119
00:07:17,561 --> 00:07:20,950
I got to cut a better deal.
And I went and said to her,

120
00:07:20,951 --> 00:07:22,750
I will sell Avon in school,

121
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:27,040
but I needed to be 50 50
and I started making money,

122
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:31,720
200 bucks a week selling Avon,
paying down my,

123
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,910
you know, my, my entire tuition.

124
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:38,680
And then having the nuns sent home a
letter to my parents so my dad wouldn't be

125
00:07:38,681 --> 00:07:42,400
upset that if I was paying
down the tuition and I
brought it home and my mother

126
00:07:42,401 --> 00:07:46,840
goes, what does it say? And my father
goes, your daughter is a genius.

127
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,980
And Jesus helped us after all.

128
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:55,020
And I think that was the beginning of
the Aha that if there's a problem we can

129
00:07:55,151 --> 00:07:58,210
fix it. There's no point in
being a victim. We fix it.

130
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:03,870
And I think that life is a series of
those issues that maybe for some someone

131
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:08,260
else is a catastrophe.
And for me it was like the beginning,

132
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,570
the beginning blocks of my,

133
00:08:10,571 --> 00:08:15,100
you know when I'm Beyonce talks
about her persona, Sasha fierce.

134
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:19,720
I mean there is, I am like a Latina
immigrant from New Jersey who's kind of,

135
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:24,010
you know how sometimes self esteem
issues show up and I don't feel good.

136
00:08:24,011 --> 00:08:26,780
And then,
and then I created a persona and I'm,

137
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:31,240
I got my own version of Sasha fierce
going on. I'm like, I'm a beast.

138
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,600
And it happened brick by brick step by
step learning that no one else is smarter

139
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:42,250
than us, that it's a matter
of being louder and braver.

140
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,920
This is not a country of wimpy people.

141
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,990
This is not a country of not understanding
the constitution and the First

142
00:08:49,991 --> 00:08:54,991
Amendment and not understanding that
you have rights and that we're all very

143
00:08:55,441 --> 00:08:58,530
much part of this country and our
voice needs to be heard. I mean,

144
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:03,150
don't you love seeing a Latina
on mainstream TV defending women,

145
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,840
multicultural women and Latinas?
Why do we feel like we can't do that?

146
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,560
Why do we marginalize ourselves in small
situations when in fact we have all the

147
00:09:12,811 --> 00:09:17,370
power in the world. Latinas
in this country are the
number one emerging market.

148
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,840
That means we are the number one
consumers in America together with African

149
00:09:21,841 --> 00:09:26,610
American women, Asian women, Middle
Eastern women. If we unite together,

150
00:09:26,611 --> 00:09:29,730
there is no company that
can survive without us.

151
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:35,630
So how do we not put that information
inside our bodies and become empowered and

152
00:09:36,871 --> 00:09:40,710
know that we have all the
power in the world? We take
ownership, we are self made.

153
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,250
That's right. That's right.
It's a mindset shift.

154
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:47,310
Now, there was a moment in
your journey when you were,

155
00:09:47,311 --> 00:09:52,260
you were working for a corporation and
you realized at that moment that you were

156
00:09:52,261 --> 00:09:53,400
acting like an owner,

157
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:56,070
but you really weren't enough.
Can you tell us?

158
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,870
So I got into television,
um, very early on.

159
00:10:00,871 --> 00:10:05,160
I was lucky because I wrote an article
to 17 magazine about why you should never

160
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:07,230
send your kid to all girl Catholic school.

161
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:12,000
And they published it and it was a
biggest guy on the low and my family.

162
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,050
And as a result, um, 17
magazine offered me a guest,

163
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,890
the youngest guest editors ship
in their history. Um, so again,

164
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,650
that's when I learned it doesn't
pay to be wimpy, speak up.

165
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:26,850
And I got into 17 magazine,
which led me to television,

166
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:31,790
which in my wildest dreams I would
never have done. And very early on, um,

167
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,750
I met, I, I, you know,

168
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:38,751
in television I was interviewing a lot
of people and I met a gentleman who was a

169
00:10:38,941 --> 00:10:42,510
very big producer in Hollywood and he's
like, are you Latino? What are you?

170
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:44,400
And I said, yeah, I am. And he said,

171
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:48,060
I just bought the first
Spanish TV station in America.

172
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,020
And he's like, why don't you come
and work for me? And I go, excuse me,

173
00:10:52,021 --> 00:10:53,340
I work for CBS.

174
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:57,180
Why do I want to work for some
Rinky Dinky Spanish TV station?

175
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,890
And he's like, I'm rich. Are
you rich? He goes, young lady,

176
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:06,240
what would it mean to be employee one
of a business that's going to be a

177
00:11:06,241 --> 00:11:09,420
multibillion dollar business?
And I was like, oh my God,

178
00:11:09,421 --> 00:11:11,400
that's how he sounds a
little smarter than me.

179
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:17,060
And I think that was my first attempt at
not really thinking anymore about what

180
00:11:17,821 --> 00:11:18,810
is my career path,

181
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:23,550
but who are the people that I'm going
to follow that are smarter than me.

182
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:28,830
I went in at 22 years of age,
ran, I was the general manager,

183
00:11:28,831 --> 00:11:32,730
the youngest general manager in the
country of the first Latino TV station,

184
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:35,970
which is now that I'm on now, but back
then it was an independent station.

185
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:41,010
I killed myself. I thought like
an owner. I work 24 hours a day.

186
00:11:41,011 --> 00:11:44,700
I had no personal life and three years
later I walk into work and they had sold

187
00:11:44,701 --> 00:11:49,290
the company and I went to see my boss
and I said, how could you do this to me?

188
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,380
This is my baby.
And he's like,

189
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,670
and I'm crying and bawling everything
they tell you not to do and he's like,

190
00:11:54,671 --> 00:11:59,500
stop young lady. Those are my
chips. If you want to play,

191
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:01,270
go get your own chips.

192
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:06,790
And that is the moment I had to
mourn that I was losing my baby.

193
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,220
And then I said I have
to start my own business.

194
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:14,910
And so I started a business at 25 making
TV shows or that's what I thought I was

195
00:12:15,371 --> 00:12:18,850
going to do.
And for four years I did not make a penny.

196
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:24,430
So I did the, I would tell you the
opposite. Do not leave your job.

197
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,670
Don't just go bootstrapping without
knowing what you're going to do.

198
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,220
I have a whole formula for you.
But I did that.

199
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,450
And can you imagine that Latino parents
put a five on to find the hottest band?

200
00:12:34,451 --> 00:12:35,860
You're losing your logs.

201
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:41,890
And four years later I
was like praying to God,

202
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:46,360
Dear God, what if I bought to throw me
a bone? Everybody thinks I'm a loser.

203
00:12:46,361 --> 00:12:50,530
It was not cool to be an entrepreneur.
Then my all my friends were like, dude,

204
00:12:50,531 --> 00:12:54,310
can you get a job? What's your
problem? And in the fourth year,

205
00:12:54,311 --> 00:12:59,200
I got invited to a chamber
of commerce event and I went,

206
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:02,050
and I always say in life, if you
show up, maybe something happens,

207
00:13:02,051 --> 00:13:06,130
maybe nothing happens, but if you don't
show up, nothing happens. Guaranteed.

208
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:10,390
I went and I started asking people
what's wrong with my business plan?

209
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:15,930
And they said immediately they were
like, your business plan's wrong. Wow.

210
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,880
There is no pipeline for your content.

211
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:23,920
There's only one station you need to go
build the pipeline in the distribution.

212
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:29,130
So I switched my business
plan to launching TV channels
around the world for big

213
00:13:29,381 --> 00:13:32,410
companies.
So it was supplier diversity in a way.

214
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:36,700
So I basically went to work with Fox,

215
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,610
HBO, Espn, Sony,

216
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:42,850
and I would take their brand
and launch it in Latin America.

217
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,150
They would find that it was my business.
So if it's screwed up,

218
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,330
they could get rid of me easily.
It was my own business.

219
00:13:49,331 --> 00:13:53,590
And then I launched it separately
and I launched 10 channels that way.

220
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:59,040
And then the original TV station that I
ran was bought by an American insurance

221
00:14:00,161 --> 00:14:03,370
company and they had bought a bunch of
stations and they didn't know how to run

222
00:14:03,371 --> 00:14:07,390
a Latino network. So it went
into bankruptcy. Sony bought it.

223
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:10,240
Sony was my client.
I had launched,

224
00:14:10,241 --> 00:14:14,740
their channels are abroad and I was
the only Latina that they knew that had

225
00:14:14,741 --> 00:14:19,090
fiscal responsibility for large
entities of theirs abroad.

226
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,420
And so they basically
offered to buy my business.

227
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,890
And offered me the presidency
of entertainment, which
is running the network.

228
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,020
That's the creative job in a network.
Um,

229
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:33,490
and so I ran Telemundo for four years
and I went back into corporate life.

230
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:38,730
So I understand very much becoming self
made as an intra entrepreneur and as an

231
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:46,000
entrepreneur outside of a corporation
and both ways is very important because

232
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:49,780
only in a corporation do you
learn how to scale something? Yes,

233
00:14:49,781 --> 00:14:52,430
I think we're all learning that.
I think even myself,

234
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,330
I've, I've, uh,

235
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:57,560
myself and Eliana who's here have coined
ourselves as like the entrepreneurs

236
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,580
creating and seeing opportunities
where they don't exist. Now tell me,

237
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,310
so you mentioned your mom at one point,

238
00:15:04,311 --> 00:15:08,060
are you and your parents were saying on
the way you need to get a husband and

239
00:15:08,061 --> 00:15:10,130
you mentioned in your book that there was,

240
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,340
there's no such thing as prince
charming or princess charming.

241
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:17,920
Well I think that's,
it is a bigger idea then then.

242
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,570
Then even how I say it,

243
00:15:19,571 --> 00:15:23,500
I say there is no prince charming and I
don't mean that against guys or anything.

244
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,990
I think there's no prince
charming for any of us.

245
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:31,410
I think the idea that a mate or a boss
or a corporation or a government or a

246
00:15:34,661 --> 00:15:37,840
president is here to save us is false.

247
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:40,870
I think that when you
work for other people,

248
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,840
you think often think whether
you're a man or a woman,

249
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:48,160
my boss is going to see how great I am
and give me the big promotion and your

250
00:15:48,161 --> 00:15:51,610
boss has their own problems in their
personal life and in their business life

251
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,550
and sometimes the company you work for,

252
00:15:54,551 --> 00:15:56,440
I mean you guys are
lucky that you're like,

253
00:15:56,441 --> 00:16:00,790
I was in an emerging field at the time
and you're all in an emerging field,

254
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:05,050
but companies go through ups and downs
and they really are not worried about you

255
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,730
and so it's not.

256
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:11,710
It's really about changing your mindset
from a victim and thinking that any job

257
00:16:11,711 --> 00:16:13,480
is good or bad to,

258
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:17,620
I have to make whatever job I
have under whatever circumstances,

259
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,910
a lesson, a learning lesson to
this puzzle that is my life.

260
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,470
That little by little,

261
00:16:23,471 --> 00:16:27,730
all the puzzle pieces are going to
make sense because you are on a journey

262
00:16:27,731 --> 00:16:28,960
that's going to take you somewhere.

263
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:32,290
We're all the puzzle pieces
are going to come in handy.

264
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,440
Now,
speaking of changing mindsets,

265
00:16:34,441 --> 00:16:39,441
so one thing that I really related to it
in your book was how the notion and of

266
00:16:39,451 --> 00:16:43,050
our relationship with fear and failure,
especially as the Latino community,

267
00:16:43,051 --> 00:16:45,510
I think we oftentimes
are more risk adverse.

268
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:49,860
So what can you say in terms of kind
of what you've written in your book,

269
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,660
advice to us to change

270
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:55,000
mindset? So I think, you
know, I think my book,

271
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:58,930
I really wanted Latinos to see
a Latina and not just Latinos,

272
00:16:58,931 --> 00:17:03,460
everybody to see that a woman of color
with speaking about money and power,

273
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:08,920
very important and that, and then a Latina
woman would say in a book, I want to,

274
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:12,610
I always want it to be a millionaire
and not from a place of greed because in

275
00:17:12,611 --> 00:17:15,820
our culture it's being rich
in every way that matters.

276
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:20,920
But from a place of knowing my power and
knowing that it's possible and knowing

277
00:17:20,921 --> 00:17:25,270
that that's why we came here. But what
gets in the way of that for all of us,

278
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,180
at least for me,
fear and fear of failure,

279
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,490
it happens every day of my life,
still every day of my life.

280
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:37,510
So what I say in the book is that
to make it to the end of your life,

281
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:41,320
you have to change your relationship
to fear and failure. And for me,

282
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:46,120
I've had to turn fear and failure
into my best friends. You know,

283
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:51,120
fear shows up every day and it's a
real thing. It's a feeling and the,

284
00:17:51,121 --> 00:17:55,410
and what comes up for all of us, which
is human, is runaway, runaway. Go Away,

285
00:17:55,411 --> 00:17:56,970
don't do it.
And for me,

286
00:17:56,971 --> 00:18:00,690
and all of you in the tech
world know that a brain,

287
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,640
just like a computer can be rewired.
You have to rewire your brain.

288
00:18:05,641 --> 00:18:10,200
You have to tell yourself, I
tell myself every day, okay,
fear shows up. My color, I,

289
00:18:10,201 --> 00:18:15,000
Shashi, and I go, okay, you're
telling me I have to do it, do it,

290
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,510
do it, do it. Anyway. When
my book was coming out,

291
00:18:18,511 --> 00:18:23,160
my dream was to have Susie Orman write
the foreword to my book as a woman of

292
00:18:23,161 --> 00:18:23,431
Color,

293
00:18:23,431 --> 00:18:27,630
the only person I had ever year as a
woman talk about money with Susie Orman.

294
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:32,500
I was obsessed with her and I wrote her
this magical email. I barely knew her.

295
00:18:32,501 --> 00:18:35,160
I met her three times,
but she wasn't my friend or anything.

296
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:40,400
I wrote her a magical email and I was
ready to send it and I and my low self

297
00:18:40,471 --> 00:18:43,040
esteem showed up. Kids will
pick it, I get the ladders.

298
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,690
Who Do you think you are like as
soon as he doesn't have time for you.

299
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,040
And I was like,
do it anyway because I've wired my brain.

300
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:53,670
I say it to myself every day. Do it
anyway, do it anyway, do it anyway.

301
00:18:53,671 --> 00:18:58,590
And I went back
and five minutes later Susie said,

302
00:18:58,591 --> 00:19:03,390
yes, I'll do it. Now that doesn't always
happen, but if you don't do it anyway,

303
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:08,310
maybe 50% chance it'll happen.
50% it won't. But you got
to keep doing it anyway.

304
00:19:08,311 --> 00:19:10,020
And then my other thing was,
you know,

305
00:19:10,021 --> 00:19:13,560
in our culture failing is like the worst,

306
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:16,830
which we know in silicon
valley it's like high five.

307
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:21,690
We felt right I five next because you're
around the corner from the answer.

308
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:26,070
But we're not raised like that. So my
other biggest fear was fear of failure.

309
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,600
And I have failed. If I
showed you my failure tape,
we'd all be crying right now.

310
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:35,730
I have failed thousands and thousands of
times to win three times in your life.

311
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,030
You better be failing thousands of times
or you're not going to win three times.

312
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:42,270
And that's all anybody remembers.
So what,

313
00:19:42,271 --> 00:19:46,380
how did I rewire my brain around failure
when I failed so many times in my

314
00:19:46,381 --> 00:19:49,050
personal life and my business
life and my finances fail?

315
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,790
I've had to say to myself, okay,
cry it out, cry it out, go mourn,

316
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:58,050
and they get back on the horse, get back
on the horse, get back on the horse.

317
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,270
Because if I don't pull myself out of it,

318
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:05,100
around the corner from my greatest
failures had been my greatest successes.

319
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,230
And if I didn't wait,
it wouldn't have happened.

320
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,500
So that's very important.

321
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:13,900
Yeah, I think oftentimes I've even
faced that where it's, I call it,

322
00:20:13,901 --> 00:20:18,340
I call it the imposter syndrome and that
we bring with us like in our everyday

323
00:20:18,341 --> 00:20:22,960
lives, US questioning if we should be
here. And especially in the tech industry,

324
00:20:22,961 --> 00:20:27,280
there's this large conversation that we
all hear everyday around diversity and

325
00:20:27,281 --> 00:20:30,520
the lack of diversity.
And so us killing the imposter syndrome.

326
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:35,350
And I've also said like, I leave that
girl at the door, let's talk about that

327
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:40,630
diversity and imposter syndrome because
I feel like the diversity is such a hot

328
00:20:40,631 --> 00:20:45,340
potato and I think we need to blow
it up because diversity to me,

329
00:20:45,341 --> 00:20:47,680
the way we've, oh, and
especially I'm than you.

330
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:50,500
So I grew up in a whole
other world of diversity.

331
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:55,890
I think diversity means somebody is
doing us a favor and I think we need to

332
00:20:56,351 --> 00:20:58,330
like, like, like blow that thing up.

333
00:20:58,331 --> 00:21:03,331
Because the truth of the matter is when
multicultural people are about to become

334
00:21:03,671 --> 00:21:08,620
the majority in this country and
very by the year 2022 number two,

335
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:12,790
when multicultural women are the
number one consumer in America,

336
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:16,360
the answer is we're doing
everybody else a favor.

337
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:19,240
And if the company doesn't
look like all of us,

338
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:24,510
it will sooner or later fail because that
means you have no relationship to your

339
00:21:25,211 --> 00:21:29,080
customer, the number one
customer in the world period.

340
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,450
So you really have to take that in.

341
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,470
So somehow we've told ourselves
a story about diversity below,

342
00:21:35,471 --> 00:21:39,430
not wear it up because we are lucky.

343
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:42,610
They are lucky to have
us because we represent.

344
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:46,990
Then there are a number one customer.
So let's not ever think that again.

345
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,260
I love it.
Now how is it that you and your book,

346
00:21:50,261 --> 00:21:53,200
you talk about you and in
order for you to be chosen,

347
00:21:53,201 --> 00:21:55,600
you have to choose yourself
first. That's right. How do you,

348
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:56,700
how do you go about that?
Tell us.

349
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,320
Well, if I ask a man, you know, as
someone who worked in television,

350
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,760
cause worked in television for many years,

351
00:22:01,761 --> 00:22:06,761
I cast a lot of people and let's say I'm
casting a cooking show and I go up to a

352
00:22:07,641 --> 00:22:10,620
man and I say, well what do you do? Oh,
I'm a chef, I've been a chef for them.

353
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,760
I'm an award winning chef and maybe
they just started six months ago.

354
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:19,420
If I say that to a woman, uh,
you guys go, Oh, you know,

355
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:22,580
I'm a real, I kind of can cook really
well. I go, well, are you a shot for,

356
00:22:22,581 --> 00:22:25,460
are not a chef Tom?
If you don't declare yourself,

357
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,790
how am I supposed to give you
a, you know, an opportunity?

358
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:31,370
I think that we have to forget.

359
00:22:31,371 --> 00:22:36,371
Humility is a beautiful thing except
at work you really have to declare

360
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:41,930
yourself. You have to say,
you have to know who you are,
know what you're good at,

361
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:47,200
and say it and call it out and raise
your hand and show up at events and speak

362
00:22:47,361 --> 00:22:50,990
up. That's where Cheryl's right.
You have to lean in, right.

363
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:55,400
And I think to not understand that
we live in a world of loud people.

364
00:22:55,401 --> 00:22:56,840
This is a loud country.

365
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:02,090
It does not pay to be [inaudible] and
all that and that's why I tell everybody,

366
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,880
I'm going to just tell you right now,
I could never,

367
00:23:04,881 --> 00:23:09,881
as a Latina from New Jersey and my
grant with my humble parents have raised

368
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:14,360
millions of dollars from my businesses.
If I didn't go and take acting lessons,

369
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:19,430
I recommend everybody take acting lessons.
It's Super Fun.

370
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:24,440
It's a great way to meet people that
you want to date and it's going to serve

371
00:23:24,441 --> 00:23:29,390
you very well in life because
I'm super introverted.

372
00:23:29,391 --> 00:23:33,260
You would never know that,
right? Super, super introverted,

373
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:36,260
but I've had to cultivate an extra,
you know my,

374
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:41,440
my Sasha fierce side and I think that
you do it by pretending you're someone

375
00:23:42,201 --> 00:23:44,990
else in a character. You
know, every time I've raised,

376
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:48,920
I made believe I was my old
Jewish bosses that were like,

377
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,080
if you don't give me the money,
someone else is going to,

378
00:23:51,081 --> 00:23:54,890
you're going to miss the opportunity.
I can even get into their voice and I,

379
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:58,970
when I spoke inside their body,
I would get money. I go, man,

380
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:00,020
this stuff works.

381
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,670
So I want you all to think that we
can't all be good at everything.

382
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:09,530
Cultivate these sides of us.
In order for me to sell TV shows,

383
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:10,730
even though I was an introvert,

384
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:14,570
I had to go and pitch the show
and make people excited about,

385
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,360
I had to cultivate a sales persona.
Huh.

386
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,990
Now going to, so it's noisy.
You mentioned noisy earlier,

387
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:27,310
which brings me to another point.
You said you to make an immigrant,

388
00:24:27,311 --> 00:24:28,121
you're a role model,

389
00:24:28,121 --> 00:24:32,470
which I think is a really interesting
point because in today's political world

390
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,540
to say that I think is,
it's a strong statement.

391
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:39,400
It's a statement that I
think is beautiful, but maybe
some other people may have.

392
00:24:39,401 --> 00:24:40,234
Yeah.

393
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,120
Well I think,

394
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,920
I think everything that I am
is because I'm an immigrant.

395
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,770
I think it's my superpower. It's my, it's,

396
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:54,130
it is my secret sauce because
immigrants of which, you know,

397
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:58,160
80% of CEOS in America, immigrants, by
the way. So that should tell us something.

398
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:03,230
I think that immigrants come to this
country and are super patriotic.

399
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:08,060
We've come from a place where something
bad has happened and we are grateful to

400
00:25:08,061 --> 00:25:12,770
be here and we are hard working.
We're willing to do whatever it takes.

401
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:17,120
We're willing to still bootstrap.
Yeah. And do whatever it takes.

402
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:19,190
And on top of that,

403
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:23,720
we have an incredible value system that
I don't think people realize, you know,

404
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:28,160
uh, the other day I spoke at the FBI, I've
spoken at the military, you know, I'm a,

405
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:31,700
you know, you wouldn't think that
of that Latina Latino immigrant.

406
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:36,530
I cry at the American flag.
I cry when I'm around the military.

407
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,810
I loved being at the FBI the other day.

408
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:43,100
I am proud to be an American
in this country. And I have,

409
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:46,820
my mother always said to me,
you have the best of both worlds.

410
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,050
You get to be Latina and passionate
and colorful and eat Latin food.

411
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:55,700
And you get to be fully American. And I
think that says it all. So when my book,

412
00:25:55,701 --> 00:26:00,500
I wrote an entire chapter,
think like an immigrant and follow,

413
00:26:00,501 --> 00:26:03,020
make an immigrant.
You're a role model.

414
00:26:03,021 --> 00:26:08,021
You will not go wrong because immigrants
are leading the life and the and

415
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:11,600
they're holding the values
that we've lost in this country

416
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:17,020
and talk to us about. So I majored
in finance, um, as an Undergrad.

417
00:26:17,021 --> 00:26:20,010
So I've always been really intrigued
because I felt like growing up,

418
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,640
coming from an impoverished background,

419
00:26:21,641 --> 00:26:24,070
I wanted to make sure that I
understood how to manage money.

420
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,230
That was like my important thing.
We don't have a lot of it.

421
00:26:26,231 --> 00:26:28,950
Let me ensure that I manage it well.
Um,

422
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:33,010
and in your book you talk about the
hidden money in America and in your home.

423
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,720
That was eyeopening.

424
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:39,180
Yeah. Thank you. I think that's,
that's the big secret in the book.

425
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:43,140
I think first of all,
I always say math doesn't lie.

426
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:48,390
You know, I am very blessed because
I've always been pretty good at math,

427
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:52,020
but I didn't really like it.
And when I went to work at channel 47,

428
00:26:52,021 --> 00:26:56,790
I realized I couldn't read financial
statements and I hired a math tutor and I

429
00:26:56,791 --> 00:26:59,250
realized that it was,
I was very good at math,

430
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:01,500
but I had been taught math incorrectly.

431
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:05,520
And so I say that because so
many of us are afraid of math.

432
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:10,730
Math is super creative and
fun and I believe that why
I've been successful in my

433
00:27:11,401 --> 00:27:16,401
TV life is because I've had a real math
head because math is very important.

434
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:23,520
Um, in the book I talk about the hidden
money in America because this is one of

435
00:27:23,521 --> 00:27:26,160
those things in this
country that we don't know.

436
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:31,370
There are so many opportunities that your
taxpayer dollars offer you and yet it

437
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:33,690
doesn't get marketed to us.

438
00:27:33,691 --> 00:27:38,691
So we don't know that there is billions
of dollars in the federal government,

439
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,690
in the small business administration
and the Department of Commerce,

440
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:47,280
there's it and the Department of Commerce
that we could apply for and then start

441
00:27:47,281 --> 00:27:49,890
a business tomorrow with
their it that they funded.

442
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:53,640
There is money for not
just to fund your business,

443
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:57,720
but also to buy a building,
you know, to buy a building.

444
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,570
Every entrepreneur should at some
point try to buy the building.

445
00:28:00,571 --> 00:28:03,660
Their businesses in the building will
be worth more than your business.

446
00:28:03,661 --> 00:28:07,260
Eventually,
this real estate that Google is in,

447
00:28:07,261 --> 00:28:09,780
eventually it will be worth
more than Google. I promise you.

448
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,630
So there's so much money there.

449
00:28:12,631 --> 00:28:17,631
There's so much money in supplier
diversity in every corporation in America,

450
00:28:17,851 --> 00:28:21,930
and that means contracts that are
designated for women and minority owned

451
00:28:21,931 --> 00:28:25,950
businesses first. Now, if we don't
apply, other people can apply,

452
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,420
but why are we not applying when there's
a million nonprofits in America that

453
00:28:30,421 --> 00:28:35,100
help you fill out the paperwork and
teach you how to do it? There are grants.

454
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,650
People talk about how there's
no money to start a business.

455
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
There's so much money in grants at every
nonprofit in America for starting up

456
00:28:44,101 --> 00:28:46,050
businesses that we don't even know about.

457
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:51,720
And so there was all this money that
everybody says there's no money out there,

458
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:55,830
but it's just that the, the information
hasn't gotten to you. So what happens?

459
00:28:56,310 --> 00:29:01,310
A lot of white guys in corporations find
out about this money because they have

460
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:06,530
consultants in Washington and they go
find a woman or a minority to front a

461
00:29:07,681 --> 00:29:12,480
company and they go get the money. Why
are the rest of us not doing that? Again,

462
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,070
lack of knowledge,

463
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:18,660
lack of understanding the system of this
country where we have to make money.

464
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,030
While we sleep,
right,

465
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:25,570
I'm still working on it and that we all
the becoming self made and even being

466
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:32,391
millionaires is not some elite thing that
is only the lady that started spanx or

467
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:36,990
Zuckerberg or these one of a kind unicorn.

468
00:29:36,991 --> 00:29:40,620
People know if I,
that started as an intern,

469
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,700
went to an assistant, worked my way
up, made no money for a long time,

470
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:50,701
started really making money at 32
invested every lived beneath my means.

471
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:56,260
Even at 32 when I started making money,
I didn't go buy a lavish car or a house.

472
00:29:56,590 --> 00:30:01,590
I started buying commercial real estate
using the tax laws of this country.

473
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:05,500
$5,000 flip the buildings
kept flipping the buildings.

474
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:07,240
10 31 exchange,

475
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:13,080
which is a thing in this country that
allows you not to pay tax on your earnings

476
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:18,240
if you keep flipping the money forward
and buying more real estate and buy 45 I

477
00:30:19,091 --> 00:30:23,170
work because I want to and not because
I have to, which means I could retire.

478
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,550
Now retiring is very different
if you live in Bentonville,

479
00:30:27,551 --> 00:30:29,650
Arkansas than if you
live in San Francisco.

480
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:35,080
But all of us can do it.
Not from a place of grandiosity,

481
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:39,880
not from a place of being a founder,
not from a place of being an inventor,

482
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,570
but like a turtle like me.
One step at a time.

483
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:47,710
Deciding you're going to do three
things a year, every Sunday,

484
00:30:47,711 --> 00:30:51,910
three things every week to get to
the three things a year, every day.

485
00:30:51,911 --> 00:30:55,930
Three things to get to the three
things of the week, like a turtle.

486
00:30:55,931 --> 00:31:00,550
Slowly you win the race,
so don't buy shoes by building.

487
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:01,450
Absolutely.

488
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:06,720
Do not go for instant gratification
because you're sad or you feel bad or

489
00:31:06,911 --> 00:31:08,530
whatever.
No,

490
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:12,190
because you're going to get
over that purchase in a week.

491
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:17,230
Have a big dream. I wrote down when
I was 20 I want to own a house,

492
00:31:17,231 --> 00:31:21,580
not own a mortgage on a house,
own a building on a business,

493
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,720
have a house in my,
in my country of origin,

494
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:29,350
which it's not going to be cute bus.
It was going to be Miami and I have it.

495
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:34,860
I want to retire by 65 I got to my
number at 45 without being j Lo,

496
00:31:34,931 --> 00:31:39,910
Beyonce, an athlete or Mark Zuckerberg,
none of the above. And I still made it.

497
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:43,960
So what is everybody else's problem?
If I can do it,

498
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:48,700
all of you can, should and will
do it. It's only a matter of time.

499
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,650
That's right.
So tell me,

500
00:31:50,651 --> 00:31:54,910
did you have a mentor in terms of
real estate or, great question.

501
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,920
Well,
I'll tell you this,

502
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:01,060
this is in my book to everybody thinks
a lot of people come up to me and they

503
00:32:01,061 --> 00:32:03,070
say, can you be my
mentor? I go, me, I'm on.

504
00:32:03,071 --> 00:32:05,380
I don't have enough hours in the
day to be everybody's mentor.

505
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,140
I'll tell you this,
I have Atlanta mentors,

506
00:32:08,141 --> 00:32:10,780
but not one of my mentors
knows they were my mentor.

507
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:15,370
So when I found people that
I thought were super smart,

508
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,970
I would stay late and hang out with them.
I'd volunteer,

509
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:23,650
I'd read everything about them,
everything I would go to,

510
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:28,510
every event they spoke at, I would write
down everything they said and what I do.

511
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,970
And I really think this works.
You know,

512
00:32:30,971 --> 00:32:34,000
for those of you that are very young
listening that are in your twenties go to

513
00:32:34,001 --> 00:32:37,150
50 cars to you that's old age
to those of us that are older,

514
00:32:37,151 --> 00:32:42,151
go to 80 85 start looking at people that
are the oldest you think they can be

515
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
and start making a composite person of
everything you love about somebody there.

516
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,720
You know,
we're all human.

517
00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:54,270
We have good sides and Beth and you can't
find one perfect person and that's why

518
00:32:54,271 --> 00:32:56,240
people get disappointed because they
think they're going to find everything on.

519
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:59,740
One person forgot about it.
You see this person over here and you go,

520
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:03,350
I like the way they've dealt with money.
I liked how they live in old age.

521
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:06,350
I like this person,
how they deal with family.

522
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:11,560
I like this person's spirituality and
make a composite and make a picture of it

523
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:17,290
and write down everything you want and
go to 85 or two 50 of you're in your 20s

524
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,850
and work your way backwards.

525
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:25,390
I did it to 50 and I saw all these people
that I want it to be and I got to 50

526
00:33:26,181 --> 00:33:29,720
and now I'm thinking about 85 or 90 or
even a hundred cause I plan to live a

527
00:33:29,721 --> 00:33:33,530
very long time.
All right now to,

528
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:38,510
so three pieces of advice in terms of
making money in our sleep. Oh, easy.

529
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:42,680
Number one, do not leave
your job. Number two,

530
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:48,140
lower your overhead. I have to give
you more than three. Number three,

531
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:53,330
start a side hustle one hour a week
and you're not cheating on your company

532
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:54,170
because if you're not doing this,

533
00:33:54,171 --> 00:33:55,850
you're not bringing anything
back to your company.

534
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,450
You need to be out there doing
the shared economy. So ladies,

535
00:33:59,451 --> 00:34:02,150
clean out your closets
that Kingston yet I drives,

536
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:07,100
whatever you don't want one hour a
week south, something in your house,

537
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:10,280
start there and put that money away.

538
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:13,610
Everyone should have a compound
interest account in the bank.

539
00:34:13,611 --> 00:34:18,110
I always tell if you're 20 something
and you put $5 a day away in a compound

540
00:34:18,111 --> 00:34:21,740
interest, you will be a millionaire
by 50 so let's just start there.

541
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:27,890
One hour a week, side hustle, put
the money away, lower year over it.

542
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:28,920
Start.
It's,

543
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:33,380
it's really fun to watch money grow
when you have two years of money,

544
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:35,090
say two years of salary.

545
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:38,840
One one of those years is for a rainy day.

546
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:41,210
The other one is your investment fund.

547
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:45,710
I want you to think what you don't all
have to be entrepreneurs that create

548
00:34:45,711 --> 00:34:48,590
businesses. What are you going
to invest in real estate?

549
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:53,870
I mean immediately especially, I mean,
how much is real estate gone up here?

550
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,560
Crazy. Okay? If not,

551
00:34:57,561 --> 00:35:00,020
look at a little business
down your street.

552
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:03,230
Some old person that's going to retire
and their kids don't want the business.

553
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,600
Pick something that already exists.

554
00:35:05,601 --> 00:35:10,601
Don't invent something that is for
the one 1.111 percentile franchises.

555
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,380
Do you know what the number one franchise
in America is right now? Tutoring,

556
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:20,120
buying a franchise is like if
I had to do my life over again,

557
00:35:20,121 --> 00:35:24,410
I'd buy 20 franchises,
I'm gonna make my kid of different sorts.

558
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:28,100
But if food, Yoga, tutoring, whatever,

559
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,890
I mean they give you the color by number,
how to do it,

560
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,430
why does everything have to be so hard?
You saved some money,

561
00:35:34,431 --> 00:35:37,070
put it in and the thing
makes money while you sleep.

562
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,870
So there are many,
many,

563
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:44,220
many ways to become self
made and we all must do it.

564
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:46,410
Even if you work in a corporation,

565
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:50,790
you have to be an entrepreneur and
you have to be cultivating your

566
00:35:50,791 --> 00:35:53,580
entrepreneurial self made life.

567
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:59,080
Looking back, uh, what are, and I
think I know the answer to this,

568
00:35:59,081 --> 00:36:02,260
but what is your most
proudest moment looking back?

569
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,730
Well two things.
Obviously my son that I gave birth to,

570
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:08,680
which I don't even know how
I did that cause you know,

571
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:09,760
I didn't know what I was doing,

572
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,560
but my parents are very happy about that
and I have four step kids. So I'm very,

573
00:36:14,561 --> 00:36:17,290
and I wish if I had to do my life over
again, I think I'd have more kids.

574
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,230
Cause I cause I,
cause I think that's a great part of life.

575
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:25,560
And then my other do realize that when
my time clock was ticking so hard that

576
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:28,240
no,
but I realize it now.

577
00:36:28,241 --> 00:36:31,030
I realized it in the last few
weeks because my son is leaving,

578
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,220
this is his senior year in high school.
And I'm like,

579
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:36,630
why didn't I have a few more
waiting behind this is to me, no,

580
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:40,390
I left home and love my mother. They're
crying. What if I bought, don't leave.

581
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:43,210
And I left. And now I feel
like man, Karma is a bitch.

582
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:49,200
But my other proudest moment is that
I started in television and I started

583
00:36:49,841 --> 00:36:53,590
college and I dropped out because
I got so many jobs in television.

584
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:57,100
And you know,
really at that time an emerging field,

585
00:36:57,310 --> 00:37:02,110
my life experience was really valuable.
But I always wanted to go back to school.

586
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:06,780
And I really felt as I got older,
like there was real gaps. Um,

587
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,790
not just in my education because
my business education was,

588
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:13,500
I had gotten it in other ways,
but my emotional intelligence, uh,

589
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:17,290
and my ability to read people and my
ability to do other things. And so my,

590
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:20,500
my second proudest moment is that
I took a four year sabbatical,

591
00:37:20,501 --> 00:37:23,410
which for a type a workaholic
is very hard to do.

592
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:28,210
So that I only did it when I felt like
I had enough money, you know, to do it.

593
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:31,690
And I went back to school and I got
a master's and doctorate in clinical

594
00:37:31,691 --> 00:37:35,050
psychology, which I'm very proud of
so that I can be all your shrinks.

595
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:40,120
And I don't think I would have written
this book had I not done that because I

596
00:37:40,121 --> 00:37:43,810
had to go back to school. My first
professor said, you write like a rapper.

597
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,940
And I was like,
because you know,

598
00:37:45,941 --> 00:37:49,210
I was in TV where they were like pithy
little marketing things that I wrote and

599
00:37:49,211 --> 00:37:51,700
he's like, here's Strunk and white,
learn to write all over again. And I go,

600
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,020
I love this.

601
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,280
And I ended up writing 97 papers
and a thesis and a dissertation.

602
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,480
And I don't think I would've had the
discipline to go back and write this book,

603
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:04,320
which I had done after going to school.
Okay.

604
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,720
And tell us what's on the horizon.
What's next?

605
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:11,430
Well, I have been on a, as
I said, 130 city book tour.

606
00:38:11,431 --> 00:38:16,050
I first need arrest and I think my
priority for the rest of the year,

607
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:20,190
it has to be the rest of the year and
into next early next year is first of all

608
00:38:20,191 --> 00:38:23,190
to analyze what I've learned on the road.

609
00:38:23,191 --> 00:38:26,610
I've met so many men and women,
I've heard,

610
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:30,150
I feel like I've been Hillary Clinton
for a year, you know, city by city,

611
00:38:30,151 --> 00:38:32,280
by city meeting all kinds of people.

612
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:35,620
And I really want to analyze that
and figure out what to do with that

613
00:38:35,621 --> 00:38:39,730
information, like a good entrepreneur.
But also I want to focus on my son.

614
00:38:39,731 --> 00:38:44,680
It's his last year of high school and
I really want to be there for him and

615
00:38:44,681 --> 00:38:46,530
really help them out.
And,

616
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:51,640
and then I'm very open to all new things
because I think the number one thing

617
00:38:51,641 --> 00:38:55,960
that I would say is important for all
of us is to evolve and grow every day.

618
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:56,621
You know,

619
00:38:56,621 --> 00:39:01,240
there's so much that I know now and so
much that I've mastered and yet so much

620
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,253
that I don't know.

621
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:06,220
And I think that we all have to wake
up every day understanding that we know

622
00:39:06,221 --> 00:39:07,054
nothing at all.

623
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:12,100
And I think when you think like that
magical things happen to you and you're

624
00:39:12,101 --> 00:39:15,640
open to new ideas,
new possibilities.

625
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:20,890
And I'm right now sitting on two years
and a book where I did so much research

626
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:25,750
of knowledge that I have to now spend
the time to take all that, you know,

627
00:39:25,751 --> 00:39:29,320
research and development that I've done
and figure out what do I do with that

628
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:31,180
and any advice,

629
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:35,230
we're for the Latinos here at Google
and just in the tech industry.

630
00:39:35,231 --> 00:39:38,080
I know you're going to be meeting
hundreds of more Latino's.

631
00:39:38,081 --> 00:39:41,800
What do you think that we
should be thinking of and
what can we be doing more of?

632
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:44,150
Well, I think, I mean
I've said this before,

633
00:39:44,151 --> 00:39:46,460
but you all have to be louder and braver.

634
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:52,420
It kills me to have everything that's
happened this year and to have my African

635
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:57,650
American friends say, why are you
Latino so quiet? Why do you take it?

636
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,880
And I,
and I understand why we take it,

637
00:40:00,881 --> 00:40:04,880
cause that's how we were raised and it's
our parents baggage. They're afraid,

638
00:40:04,881 --> 00:40:09,881
but it's your all of your jobs to
not carry that baggage with you.

639
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,590
You have to know there's
nothing to be afraid of.

640
00:40:12,591 --> 00:40:16,460
No one's going to do anything to you.
It's all BS. Nothing's going to happen.

641
00:40:16,461 --> 00:40:17,420
On the contrary.

642
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:22,730
And I think that the best advice I can
give you is sometimes I understand that

643
00:40:22,731 --> 00:40:23,481
we may,
you know,

644
00:40:23,481 --> 00:40:27,140
although I believe the answer for all
of us is uniting with all the other

645
00:40:27,141 --> 00:40:31,880
multiculturals and learning from each
other because we all have different traits

646
00:40:31,881 --> 00:40:32,870
and different skills.

647
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:37,550
I understand that sometimes let's say our
voice can't be the voice of an African

648
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:41,660
American sister who was very empowered
and very strong. Maybe that's not us,

649
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,000
but what you can,
one of our super,

650
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:47,000
super powers is we're
very vulnerable people.

651
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:52,310
And so sometimes when someone says
something in front of you and it's really

652
00:40:52,311 --> 00:40:55,380
like not cool, sometimes they
don't even mean it. It's just they,

653
00:40:55,400 --> 00:41:00,380
it's their learned wiring and behavior.
You have to say something like, excuse me,

654
00:41:00,381 --> 00:41:03,110
what did you just say?
You just stabbed me in the heart.

655
00:41:03,111 --> 00:41:06,950
That was so painful to hear.
That is so,

656
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:11,750
that is so hurtful. And that's just
as strong as saying, excuse me.

657
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,920
There's many ways to
skin the cat and be loud.

658
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:21,560
Maybe it's not always being loud.
Maybe it's being honest and vulnerable,

659
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,510
but we have to speak up.

660
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:28,670
I don't allow people to say things
about my culture, not in public.

661
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:29,503
And by the way,

662
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:32,870
you don't think I was afraid to go on
Fox News knowing that they were going to,

663
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:38,730
I broke out in hives, but I did it anyway
and I didn't die. You know, there was a,

664
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,230
there was, I said a few things and
about immigrants and they, you know,

665
00:41:42,231 --> 00:41:45,520
I on social media, people were
like trolling me like crazy. I,

666
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:49,280
so what the next day it's over.
You're not going to die.

667
00:41:49,281 --> 00:41:50,330
Nothing's going to happen,

668
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:54,440
but you're going to gain character and
there's something that no one can take

669
00:41:54,441 --> 00:41:57,830
away from you when you speak
on behalf of your family.

670
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:04,490
That's beautiful. Um, I want to make
sure that you get any last remarks,

671
00:42:04,491 --> 00:42:08,420
but I also want to see if anyone here and
the audience has questions for Nellie.

672
00:42:08,421 --> 00:42:12,980
This has been my, uh, magic moment
at Google having you here. It's been,

673
00:42:12,981 --> 00:42:15,210
it's been awhile. We've been planning
this. What? I'm really, yeah,

674
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,990
they're so proud of all of you. I
in Ileana. I'm so proud of you too.

675
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:23,340
Love you guys. Um, yeah. So
I'm wanna hear questions.

676
00:42:23,341 --> 00:42:27,920
Don't you guys want to know
about Donald Trump? Okay.

677
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:31,650
So I'll just tell you a quick celebrity
apprentice story cause I think you'll

678
00:42:31,651 --> 00:42:35,520
enjoy it. So I, you know,
when I ran Tele Mondo,

679
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:40,640
we sold it and NBC gave me a
very big deal to produce shows.

680
00:42:41,071 --> 00:42:44,220
So I produced about 700 shows
in English and Spanish. I,

681
00:42:44,221 --> 00:42:47,490
that's why I say I'm Tyler Perry Latina.
Um,

682
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,190
and I get a call one day
from NBC and they said,

683
00:42:50,191 --> 00:42:52,980
we want you to be on celebrity
apprentice. And I was like, well,

684
00:42:52,981 --> 00:42:57,890
I produce reality shows. I'm not in them.
And they said, no, we really think, uh,

685
00:42:57,930 --> 00:42:58,950
the president of NBC said,

686
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:02,580
I really think you would be great
because Donald Trump is tough.

687
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:05,760
And we think if we put a
Latina actress or something,

688
00:43:05,761 --> 00:43:08,580
he might really insult
them. And you know, you're,

689
00:43:08,581 --> 00:43:13,470
you've worked for six billionaires and
you've had them as clients and there are

690
00:43:13,471 --> 00:43:17,340
a lot worse than Donald Trump and take
it, you can take it. And the truth is,

691
00:43:17,341 --> 00:43:21,420
I've had to take it, you guys, I've worked
in Hollywood, I have been yelled at,

692
00:43:21,421 --> 00:43:22,254
screamed at,

693
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:26,460
I've had people be very disrespectful
and I had to like not take it personally

694
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:30,390
and put people in their place.
I had to go into my other persona.

695
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:34,530
So I said, right. And they go, we're not
asking. You were kind of telling you.

696
00:43:34,531 --> 00:43:36,510
And I was like, but I'm not
a celebrity. They're like,

697
00:43:36,511 --> 00:43:41,340
why don't you just say thank you for
millions of dollars of publicity for your

698
00:43:41,341 --> 00:43:43,230
personal brand? And I was
like, okay, thank you.

699
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,100
And I went on celebrity apprentice
and in the first episode,

700
00:43:47,101 --> 00:43:48,240
Donald Trump yelled at me.

701
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:51,870
And in the first episode I did what I
would've done with any of them have you

702
00:43:51,871 --> 00:43:55,320
saw me on the show. I would very
respectfully, because I didn't do it like,

703
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:57,330
you know, as they say in Spanish
and I go to, I'll say that, no,

704
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:01,650
I would do it very like, I'm
sorry, but no, I don't agree
with, you know, we're not,

705
00:44:01,651 --> 00:44:02,250
you know.

706
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:06,810
And we got into these very
feisty conversations and
after the first episode when

707
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:10,130
we were off camera, he said to me, Oh, I,

708
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:13,920
it's so great that you yelled back
at me how great. Keep doing it.

709
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:15,120
We're going to get a lot of ratings.

710
00:44:15,121 --> 00:44:18,270
Latino's are love you because they don't
like me and it'll be great that you're

711
00:44:18,271 --> 00:44:21,960
yelling at me. And um, and that
tells you a lot about him. You know,

712
00:44:21,961 --> 00:44:24,270
like he loves to argue for sport.

713
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:27,210
And he was very into the ratings.

714
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:31,920
And very much the value of his property.
But I actually,

715
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:36,600
um, had a great time on
celebrity apprentice because
I was partnered up with Gene

716
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:40,530
Simmons from kiss. And you know, when
he's not being the guy from kiss,

717
00:44:40,531 --> 00:44:44,760
he's like a Jewish dad. He was very
lovely. And one day he says to me, Golan,

718
00:44:44,761 --> 00:44:46,320
you're,
you're such a smart girl,

719
00:44:46,321 --> 00:44:50,790
but I feel like you're always climbing
a mountain the hardest possible way.

720
00:44:50,791 --> 00:44:54,300
Like you're, you're struggling like
an immigrant that just arrived.

721
00:44:54,301 --> 00:44:55,650
And I thought it was like he,

722
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:58,920
he was like stabbing me in the
heart because I thought that's true.

723
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,330
Sometimes there's Latinos.

724
00:45:00,331 --> 00:45:03,570
We don't even know how to enjoy
the journey if it's not hard,

725
00:45:03,571 --> 00:45:04,740
if we're not struggling,

726
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:07,440
if it's not climbing a mountain
the hardest possible way.

727
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:12,090
And so I've given a lot of thought to
that and I think what I need to work on

728
00:45:12,091 --> 00:45:16,920
the rest of my life, because God
knows I'm not a baked cake, uh, is,

729
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:17,700
you know,

730
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:22,700
achieving things with ease
versus struggling so much
having to suffer so much to

731
00:45:24,151 --> 00:45:24,984
make things happen.

732
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:27,390
The quick question on
curricular real estate,

733
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:32,810
what's the biggest lesson learned or
like the hardest thing that you had,

734
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:33,673
like figure it out?

735
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:37,140
Well, I think, you know, I did,

736
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:42,180
I did find mentors in real
estate as well. Um, my,

737
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:46,380
I have a mentor in real estate,
her name is Elaine and she's 75 years old.

738
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:49,950
And one of those people that I met
that I just thought she was brilliant,

739
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:54,951
she was developing real estate and I
started taking her to dinner and to this

740
00:45:55,830 --> 00:46:00,090
day she is my mentor. I don't buy a
building without her. Um, I mean at all.

741
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:01,770
If she doesn't, okay. The building,

742
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,520
it doesn't happen because as she has
taught me very well in real estate,

743
00:46:05,521 --> 00:46:09,600
it's all math. And I have to
tell you something in my TV life,

744
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:10,860
the reason I've made,

745
00:46:10,861 --> 00:46:13,980
so I've made five times the money
in real estate than in my TV life.

746
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:17,730
And I think it's because my TV
life is creative and emotional.

747
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:21,630
Sometimes I've made bad judgment calls
because I fall in love with the show.

748
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:25,290
I don't fall in love with buildings.
If the math doesn't work,

749
00:46:25,291 --> 00:46:27,510
you don't buy the building period.

750
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:33,320
So there's something about mission and
money having something in your life that

751
00:46:33,421 --> 00:46:37,860
you love and that's, there's nothing wrong
with that. But why? Until you're rich.

752
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:39,510
As the,
as my boss told me,

753
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:43,800
the money part has to take precedence
because you only, you have,

754
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:45,390
oh so many years of life,

755
00:46:45,391 --> 00:46:48,960
force of energy where if you're
doing five things at once,

756
00:46:48,961 --> 00:46:52,950
I don't feel sorry for you because you
have a lot of energy later in your life.

757
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:57,750
You're not going to want to do that. So
to me, yes, you have to find mentors.

758
00:46:57,751 --> 00:47:02,751
You have to go go to events like this
because if that's something that interests

759
00:47:03,151 --> 00:47:07,230
you, that is, that is a
path that works linearly,

760
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:08,490
slowly,

761
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,720
all the tax incentives and all
the tax laws are in your favor.

762
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:17,280
Hence Donald Trump. When he says,
I don't pay very many taxes,

763
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:19,290
he's not lying.
That part is true.

764
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:24,470
All of us can pay lesser taxes if we
follow the tax laws and invest in things

765
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:27,600
that give us all kinds of benefits.

766
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:34,750
Your new role, someone in the last
five years? Well, I'll tell you my,

767
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:38,830
my, my role model that I, that I
think about most often. I have a few,

768
00:47:38,831 --> 00:47:43,831
but I love Gloria Steinem because I love
Gloria Steinem at 85 she is beautiful.

769
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:50,580
She is really deep and profound and like
peaceful and yet she's still doing her

770
00:47:52,181 --> 00:47:54,130
work. She still shows up
and speaks and all that.

771
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:59,580
I also had a professor in
school who was 80 at the time,

772
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:04,830
82 so she's now 85 who had gone back to
school at 50 after raising five kids had

773
00:48:06,551 --> 00:48:11,551
become the world's foremost expert on
Sigmund Freud has written six books on

774
00:48:11,801 --> 00:48:16,801
Sigmund Freud and now she travels all
over the world lecturing in her expertise,

775
00:48:16,961 --> 00:48:17,830
which is sigma for it.

776
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:22,120
And at 82 she looked like she
was 50 and I thought to myself,

777
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:27,070
and then she really inspired me in
school to find what is my True Path.

778
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:28,840
There's a lot of TV producers,

779
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:33,880
but what I thought that I offer the world
uniquely is from a multicultural voice.

780
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:39,240
I really walk the walk of
an entrepreneurial person
of a self made woman.

781
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:40,690
I've done,

782
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:45,400
I've sacrificed what you need to sacrifice
to get to my age and be self made and

783
00:48:45,401 --> 00:48:50,401
be sad and I felt like it is my duty
and when I saw Sheryl it concretely was

784
00:48:51,551 --> 00:48:52,384
clear to me.

785
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:57,690
It's my duty to pass that on obviously
first to my Latinas because I love you

786
00:48:58,001 --> 00:48:59,410
guys and I want you all to succeed.

787
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:05,100
Then then two other multicultural women
and men and then to to all young people

788
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:09,820
because I don't want everyone to think
that you have to be that one of a kind

789
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:14,800
unicorn person that makes it big
when all of us can do it. As I said,

790
00:49:14,801 --> 00:49:15,634
like a turtle.

791
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:17,760
I know we're going to be doing
a book signing after this,

792
00:49:17,761 --> 00:49:21,420
but I want to thank you again
for Nelly Golan for being here.

793
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:25,740
Joining us for talks at
Google in collaboration with
all our Google's Hispanic,

794
00:49:25,741 --> 00:49:29,700
Google or network and talking about self
main New York Times bestselling book,

795
00:49:29,701 --> 00:49:32,840
becoming empowered,
self reliant and enrich and everything

796
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:36,470
rich in every way. That's the
key. And why are we doing this?

797
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:41,680
To pass the torch to the next generation
of a mindset that is self reliant,

798
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:43,790
that thinks like owners,

799
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:48,680
that multicultural people particularly
think like owners and everything.

800
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,020
We do. Thank you. Thank you.
