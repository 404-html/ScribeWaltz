1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,770
So thank you for coming today. What, um,

2
00:00:08,771 --> 00:00:13,660
what I loved most and the book is how
authentic and how vulnerable you were,

3
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,360
which I feel like when someone's
writing about their life,

4
00:00:16,361 --> 00:00:21,361
they don't always want to write about
the scary or sad or other parts of it.

5
00:00:21,431 --> 00:00:25,750
And I liked that you win fair
with us in the book. So what,

6
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:30,250
why did you decide to take that kind of
route and not make it be all like roses

7
00:00:30,251 --> 00:00:33,190
and fairy tales?
Roses and fairy tales,

8
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,550
not real life and it's boring.
Um,

9
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:42,100
it was scary to make the decision to be
so open and vulnerable, but I just felt,

10
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,730
I feel like it's the
only way people relate.

11
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:50,790
And it's something I discovered a long
time ago on a spin bike and I started to

12
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:55,300
talk about personal things up there. I
wouldn't make it subjective. I would,

13
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,890
I would say things in a way that it would
apply to everybody and everyone would

14
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:05,070
immediately relate to what I was saying
and get a lot out of it and know that

15
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,530
all the challenges that we face every day,
we're not alone,

16
00:01:08,531 --> 00:01:10,390
that we're all facing
them kind of together.

17
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,360
What made you ready to write the memoir?

18
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:18,520
So a lot of people throughout
the years always would say to me,

19
00:01:18,521 --> 00:01:20,470
he knew they would hear my
story and they would say,

20
00:01:20,471 --> 00:01:23,100
you really need to write a book. And
I would just say, Oh yeah, you know,

21
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,850
never thinking would ever happen.

22
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:29,920
And it really just took one person who
said the same thing and then I said,

23
00:01:29,921 --> 00:01:33,280
yeah, yeah. And kind of dismissed
it. And he said, no, no,

24
00:01:33,281 --> 00:01:37,090
you really need to write a book and I'm
going to introduce you to a literary

25
00:01:37,091 --> 00:01:38,110
agent,
you know,

26
00:01:38,111 --> 00:01:43,111
and basically help pulled me and held
my hand and took me to meet this couple.

27
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,290
And they are literary agents and I sat
in their living room and they said,

28
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:48,880
tell me your story.
And I did.

29
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,600
And by the time I got home I
had a contract in my inbox.

30
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,530
So that's how it happened. And what
made you, the way you wrote it?

31
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:00,100
I really liked it. You, you'd shared
personal things and you offer,

32
00:02:00,101 --> 00:02:03,130
made it about how you started two
businesses and all the lessons that you

33
00:02:03,131 --> 00:02:06,550
learned in it and then you split
it into three parts. What made you,

34
00:02:06,551 --> 00:02:10,120
which were a reinvention,
rejuvenation and rewards.

35
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:14,080
Why did you decide to break it into these
parts and kind of make it a personal

36
00:02:14,081 --> 00:02:17,650
thing and also throw in the business
aspect and lessons that you learned?

37
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,440
I think that,
well first of all,

38
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:25,441
the reinvention piece is a
huge part of the story and um,

39
00:02:25,781 --> 00:02:30,781
which is why I devoted a whole section
to it because I have had a lot of

40
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,010
roadblocks along the way.
It was not an easy ride by any means,

41
00:02:36,011 --> 00:02:40,330
um, to get to being the cofounder
of both businesses. But, um,

42
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:45,600
I wanted people to know and understand
and be inspired because no matter where

43
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:51,520
we are in life, we do all have the ability
to reinvent ourselves if we want to.

44
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:56,350
And I started soul cycle when I was 48
and I started fly with them when I was

45
00:02:56,351 --> 00:02:58,480
52.
So you know,

46
00:02:58,481 --> 00:03:02,350
a lot of people shocked at that and they
can't even imagine starting a business

47
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:03,101
at those ages.

48
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:07,660
But I wanted to tell the story and let
people know that anything's possible.

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,620
Um,

50
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:13,620
so rejuvenation came from
just that starting over again,

51
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:18,580
starting over again after you've
been burned or hurt or, um,

52
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:23,850
blindsided and knowing that you can
pick yourself up and start again.

53
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,250
Um, what was the last part?
Reward for words? Yes. I mean,

54
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:31,480
obviously for me it was just about,
as I say in the subtitle of the book,

55
00:03:31,481 --> 00:03:35,950
it was just about kind of reaping
rewards from this career that,

56
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,530
uh,
I made for myself.

57
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:43,660
Never ever fathoming that
I would be here today.

58
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,120
Um, never went to business school, had,

59
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:50,470
didn't have a clue about how to run
a business. Um, and really it just,

60
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,890
it literally all came out
of following my passion.

61
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,510
And you started as a dancer.
I did. And then from there,

62
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,810
something difficult happen in life,
which everyone should read the book.

63
00:04:01,811 --> 00:04:02,960
I'm not going to give everything away.

64
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,840
You went through something difficult and
that's kind of how you found spin. Yes.

65
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,610
Um,
I,

66
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,360
it's interesting because no matter
what you do in life and you know,

67
00:04:13,361 --> 00:04:18,361
whether you were a musician or a dancer
or anything growing up and no matter

68
00:04:18,911 --> 00:04:21,360
what path your career takes,
it's,

69
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:26,380
it's so interesting in retrospect
what you bring to your career that you

70
00:04:26,651 --> 00:04:30,070
might've learned when you were
eight years old. And so for me with,

71
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,170
we were talking about
this today with dancing,

72
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:37,240
I was constantly in a dance
class and I saw how, um,

73
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,090
gratifying it was if
the dance teacher said,

74
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:45,540
great job Ruth are like beautiful Ruth
and that could just make my entire day.

75
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,590
And that's just an example of something
that I brought to the spin class because

76
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:55,360
as I said, we were talking about, um,
if someone says, great job charity,

77
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,410
that's all you need and it gives you
almost a high for the rest of the day.

78
00:04:59,411 --> 00:05:04,411
And so that was just one small component
of this product that came to be where

79
00:05:05,831 --> 00:05:09,490
at the end of the day people felt better
about themselves after 45 minutes.

80
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:13,570
So how does your method
different than the,

81
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:17,260
when you started taking spin at,
I was at a Ribeye, the river club.

82
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,520
So is your method kind of the instructor
that you fell in love with their,

83
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,400
they're really motivated you
and kept you coming back or yes.

84
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,120
You're kind of your own on top of,

85
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,400
well it started with the method of the
instructor who became my guru. And um,

86
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,330
we were also talking about that phenomenon
where you go to an exercise class and

87
00:05:34,331 --> 00:05:37,450
you just really become
obsessed with one instructor.

88
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:41,050
And then I did with this particular
instructor in two years in,

89
00:05:41,051 --> 00:05:44,590
he got up in front of the class one day
and he announced that he was moving to

90
00:05:44,591 --> 00:05:45,730
Florida and I was like,

91
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,980
how am I going even continue with my life?
And um,

92
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,270
that was the moment when I decided I,

93
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:56,800
I was just going to start teaching
because I didn't like any of the other

94
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:57,561
instructors.

95
00:05:57,561 --> 00:06:02,450
And I had a background obviously in dance
and I had taught some group exercise

96
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:04,940
before that. So, um, I,

97
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,630
so I started teaching and then my five
years of teaching and Reebok is when I

98
00:06:08,631 --> 00:06:13,631
really kind of honed my method and
added on to what he taught me and really

99
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,230
spent the time observing what
people liked, what they didn't like,

100
00:06:18,231 --> 00:06:20,150
what they took to what motivated them.

101
00:06:20,151 --> 00:06:24,170
And those were really the
formative years of my class.

102
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:29,330
And then from there you formed full
cycle I did with Elizabeth and Julie.

103
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,760
And how long did that take from the
thought of you guys wanting to have a spin

104
00:06:35,761 --> 00:06:36,541
class over your own?

105
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:40,400
Cause you noticed that people that
were going into rework to take spin,

106
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:43,920
we're only taking spin exactly that
you wanted to kind of, you guys,

107
00:06:43,921 --> 00:06:48,160
I feel like we're the pioneers
of this boutique fitness. Yes.

108
00:06:48,161 --> 00:06:50,940
That you wanted to start this
from like when you thought of it,

109
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,590
how long did it take
to come off the ground?

110
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:56,690
So, um, the fall of 2005,

111
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:01,370
Elizabeth, uh, approached me. She
was a writer in my class and said,

112
00:07:01,371 --> 00:07:06,371
I want to open up a dedicated boutique
fitness studio that only has spin and are

113
00:07:08,121 --> 00:07:11,660
you interested? I know nothing
about spin. I would love it to be,

114
00:07:11,661 --> 00:07:15,950
I would love you to be the face of the
business and have it be all about your

115
00:07:15,951 --> 00:07:19,340
method and the way you teach. And
what do you think? And I mean,

116
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,660
within a nanosecond I was like,
I'm in. Um, it was a dream of mine.

117
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:28,220
I didn't have the, the, um,
capital to fund it. She did.

118
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,400
And, um, so that was in the fall.

119
00:07:31,401 --> 00:07:35,570
And then eventually Julie, who
was also a writer, my class

120
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,680
was always interested in opening,
has been in business.

121
00:07:39,681 --> 00:07:41,390
And she and I used to talk
about it all the time,

122
00:07:41,391 --> 00:07:43,880
but neither one of us had the budget,
the money to do it.

123
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,760
So I am a very loyal person.

124
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:50,600
And I felt bad that it was Elizabeth
and I, and there was Julie.

125
00:07:50,601 --> 00:07:55,601
So I introduced Julie to
Elizabeth thinking she'd be
a great third partner and

126
00:07:55,761 --> 00:07:59,520
they headed off, hit it off. And
in answer to your question, um,

127
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,820
we started really formulating our,

128
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:06,880
our ideas in probably December and we
opened our doors in April of 2006 so not

129
00:08:09,081 --> 00:08:09,630
that long.

130
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,480
Yeah. Yeah. And then it builds Romana men,

131
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:16,860
then there was a dissolution
of partnership. Correct.

132
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:21,420
And you still taught there for a
couple of years after and then you were

133
00:08:21,421 --> 00:08:24,870
approached by two other writers.
Yes.

134
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:29,540
And then fly will was kind of born,
which I'm very happy about. Thank you.

135
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:33,630
I flywheel. So how did that, you know,

136
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:38,040
leaving soul cycle to
go found a competitor?

137
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:39,623
How did that happen?

138
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:43,570
So, uh, with the way things
went down at soul cycle,

139
00:08:43,571 --> 00:08:48,430
I was very ready to leave. And um, I met,

140
00:08:48,431 --> 00:08:52,900
as you said, one of my future cofounders
who was in my class, excuse me,

141
00:08:52,901 --> 00:08:57,050
the other one didn't he never class,
but he was his partner.

142
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:02,070
They were both in private equity and
basically they saw this business in soul

143
00:09:02,911 --> 00:09:07,911
cycle and saw the frogs of people coming
in and sat and crunched the numbers one

144
00:09:08,641 --> 00:09:12,570
day and said surreal business
and wanted to get in on it.

145
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:15,360
And so Jay, one of them, um,

146
00:09:15,361 --> 00:09:19,290
he is the one that came up with the idea
of attaching a little computer screen

147
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,630
to all the bikes where
you can be accountable,

148
00:09:21,631 --> 00:09:24,870
where you could know where your resistance
should be, what your speech should be.

149
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,470
And they found me and
presented this idea to me.

150
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:33,500
And initially I was a little
dubious because I thought,

151
00:09:33,901 --> 00:09:37,740
you know, so much of my ride was
about riding, closing your eyes,

152
00:09:37,741 --> 00:09:40,800
going inside,
tapping into what was going on,

153
00:09:40,801 --> 00:09:45,210
tapping into the song on the playlist, a
memory, whatever it was. And I thought,

154
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:47,310
well, now if we have
numbers, I don't know,

155
00:09:47,311 --> 00:09:51,330
it's distracting and then we
can't really do the mind thing.

156
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,740
And so I wasn't really sure. And
they said, well, just, just try it.

157
00:09:55,741 --> 00:09:58,890
Go into a room by yourself with
the bike and see what you think.

158
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,970
And that's what I did.
And within 15 minutes I was like,

159
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,820
this is genius.
And um,

160
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:10,650
the other thing that was so exciting about
it was it just became such an obvious

161
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:14,930
differentiator between what was
to become flywheel and soul cycle.

162
00:10:14,931 --> 00:10:18,690
So here we were starting
second in the market,

163
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:23,580
but it was such a different product that
I absolutely knew there would be room

164
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:27,210
for it. So how was it trying to, I guess,

165
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,710
change your teaching method because
soul cycle is so different? Um,

166
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:37,940
was it more difficult when you had to
add in metrics and teach by numbers and

167
00:10:37,941 --> 00:10:39,530
did that affect how you taught at all?

168
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:43,690
It definitely changed the class
that I had started at soul cycle,

169
00:10:43,691 --> 00:10:46,900
but I was able to still
incorporate some mind,

170
00:10:46,901 --> 00:10:51,010
body connection stuff with the metrics.

171
00:10:51,011 --> 00:10:56,011
And I so quickly realized that it
was such a game changer in terms of,

172
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,820
as I said,
being accountable.

173
00:10:57,821 --> 00:11:02,500
And then what happened was I started
seeing the results in people's bodies in

174
00:11:02,501 --> 00:11:06,640
there, um, joy and
gratification that they,

175
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:11,680
they got from this kind of class with
these kind of, um, realtime results.

176
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:16,510
And so I was a fan, you
know, from the get go.

177
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,130
I read an article that said the difference
between people that ride at soul

178
00:11:20,131 --> 00:11:22,740
cycle and fly wheel are that,
um,

179
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,350
five will people are masochists.

180
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:32,280
I me, I know some masochistic, I should,

181
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:37,340
I feel it's very type a it out to your
board is definitely why I'm a huge fan of

182
00:11:40,981 --> 00:11:41,814
it.

183
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:47,040
So how do you pick your playlist or is
it just like your mood or is it based on

184
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,680
the numbers we get in
class or how do you decide

185
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,030
it's so instinctual.

186
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:57,460
A music always has always been
a really huge part of my life,

187
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:01,870
especially being a dancer.
Um, growing up, you know,

188
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:06,250
I don't know, music was my escape. I
had a kind of very difficult mother,

189
00:12:06,251 --> 00:12:10,810
which I talk about in the book.
And, uh, when things got tough,

190
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,970
I would go on my room and listen to music.

191
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,710
And I ended up really learning a lot
about all different kinds of genres of

192
00:12:17,711 --> 00:12:18,880
music,
um,

193
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:22,720
through my father and the music that was
always played in my household growing

194
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:24,220
up and dancing obviously.

195
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:29,580
And so making the playlist was such a
huge part of my enjoyment in what I do.

196
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:37,600
It's just I spend an enormous amount of
time making my playlist too much time.

197
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,310
Um, but I love it. And
so very mood driven. Um,

198
00:12:42,311 --> 00:12:46,060
I would typically make a playlist for my
class the night before and then I would

199
00:12:46,061 --> 00:12:49,210
wake up in the morning and leave myself
time because I would completely change

200
00:12:49,211 --> 00:12:53,110
it the next morning. So again,
way too much time spent on it,

201
00:12:53,111 --> 00:12:55,360
but it ended up,
you know,

202
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:59,980
bringing very successful playlists
that people really liked. And um,

203
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,290
making them eclectic was
really important too.

204
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,930
So hopefully there was something
for everyone in the class.

205
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,500
So now you had,

206
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:12,690
then you had flywheel and you and David
and Jay were cranking along and it

207
00:13:12,761 --> 00:13:14,470
started to become successful.

208
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:19,770
And then Lou Frankford became a
series B investor and three Theo.

209
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,720
Okay.
Um,

210
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:27,960
how did that change the dynamics of
when it was the startups to then kind of

211
00:13:28,751 --> 00:13:31,810
becoming a bigger brand?
How did that change?

212
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:36,250
Did it change how you taught or the
dynamics of the relationships within that

213
00:13:36,251 --> 00:13:40,690
you had with the instructors? Or in
general, cause I know when Google,

214
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:45,730
obviously I've heard people talk about
when they were here before it became

215
00:13:45,731 --> 00:13:49,600
public, the difference in the culture
and when you become this giant company,

216
00:13:49,601 --> 00:13:50,680
which fly will not list.

217
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,280
Yes, huge change. Um,

218
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:57,480
Lou initially became a strategic
investors. Seriously. Um,

219
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,830
and when that happened,

220
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:03,600
the change wasn't felt that
obviously because we were all there.

221
00:14:03,601 --> 00:14:07,380
David and Jay were there and we were
still, Lou had input on decisions,

222
00:14:07,381 --> 00:14:10,050
but we were still making
most of the decisions.

223
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:15,230
It wasn't until 2014 when Lou and his
family acquired the business that things

224
00:14:16,351 --> 00:14:19,470
really changed. So, you know,
within the first two months,

225
00:14:19,471 --> 00:14:21,330
my two co founders were out.

226
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:26,130
And that in itself was a
huge adjustment for me. And,

227
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,990
um, it changed, the culture
changed drastically. And you know,

228
00:14:30,991 --> 00:14:32,640
suddenly,
I mean,

229
00:14:32,641 --> 00:14:37,200
my original office that I shared
with Jay wasn't electrical closet.

230
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:41,160
And, um, I mean we couldn't even back up
our chairs without hitting each other,

231
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:46,450
but it didn't matter. We didn't
care. Um, and then this happened, um,

232
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:51,120
the company was acquired and suddenly
we're in offices that are a city block.

233
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,800
And the whole culture changed in that
it just became much more corporate.

234
00:14:57,001 --> 00:15:01,640
So I suddenly was in this environment
where I didn't even understand the

235
00:15:01,641 --> 00:15:04,670
language. It was kind of like, um,

236
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:08,360
I'd be at a meeting and they'd
ask us to turn in our, um,

237
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:13,460
hold on our strategic operative
initiatives and I'd be like,

238
00:15:13,461 --> 00:15:16,040
what? Like I had no idea
what they're talking about.

239
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:20,330
And then someone whisper to me, it just
means what's your plan? And then I felt,

240
00:15:20,331 --> 00:15:25,040
well, why don't they say that? Like I
didn't, it was just such a shock for me.

241
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:29,410
And, um, and it was a real
growing experience, um,

242
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,680
which we talked about too.

243
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,990
So what, um, what was it like,

244
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,340
I guess when after Lou took over,

245
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:45,080
you did talk about in the book that,
I'm trying to frame this correctly,

246
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:48,710
um, now that you were trying to be
forced into a different position,

247
00:15:48,711 --> 00:15:53,330
but the expectations of what
your role were to be had changed.

248
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,330
Yes.
And where you really enjoyed teaching,

249
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:59,960
you are now kind of pushing this business
role and that didn't really make you

250
00:15:59,961 --> 00:16:00,794
happy.

251
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,760
Correct. Um, I found the whole,

252
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:08,500
I found all the changes to be intimidating
because it was just so out of my

253
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:12,270
comfort zone. And right
from the Gecko. Um,

254
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:17,400
Lou kind of wanted to mold me in a very
different way and suddenly my days were

255
00:16:18,401 --> 00:16:23,401
spent in meetings after meetings
and a lot of talking and,

256
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:29,230
you know, ideas, but, but ideas that
weren't necessarily being executed,

257
00:16:29,231 --> 00:16:33,880
but we would just keep having more
meetings. And I went into this business,

258
00:16:33,881 --> 00:16:38,860
it exactly for the exact reason that I
didn't want to be sitting in a meeting

259
00:16:38,861 --> 00:16:43,210
all day. And so it just became
really difficult. And, um,

260
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,540
I just stood up one day and I said,
this isn't working for me.

261
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:51,160
And I had no idea how they were gonna
react, but clearly they needed me.

262
00:16:51,161 --> 00:16:54,820
So they were open to what
I had to say. And, um,

263
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:59,770
through that process, I really ended
up going back to what I did best,

264
00:16:59,771 --> 00:17:03,760
which was being in charge of
everything that went on in the,

265
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:07,570
in the four walls of the studio
and, you know, training instructors,

266
00:17:07,571 --> 00:17:09,490
teaching classes,
um,

267
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,230
being back in charge of the method
and kind of all things creative.

268
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,730
And that's,
that was my happy place.

269
00:17:15,731 --> 00:17:18,880
So I did through a series
of events get back there.

270
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:23,650
So the other kind of focus on the book
that I really liked was you again talked

271
00:17:23,651 --> 00:17:25,240
about a lot of personal things,

272
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,230
the relationship that you had
with your mother and your father.

273
00:17:29,231 --> 00:17:33,250
That was kind of a triangle, this triangle
theme I noticed a lot in the book.

274
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,650
So it goes from your
mother to your father,

275
00:17:35,651 --> 00:17:38,740
then with your husband and Felipe,

276
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:42,130
then Julie and Elizabeth.

277
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:44,410
Then David and Jay keep going.

278
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:50,050
And your twin daughters and their friends.
Is this,

279
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:52,620
um, have you noticed this a lot? Like,

280
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,890
and when you're attracted
to certain situations,

281
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:57,840
if there's some kind of trio that happens,

282
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:03,240
apparently that is what
happens. And um, you know,

283
00:18:03,241 --> 00:18:04,100
as I also talk to

284
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:04,791
about in the book,

285
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:09,791
I started therapy long time
ago when I was 35 and I'm 60,

286
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:16,250
I'll be 61 in March. Um, so
I've had a lot of years in,

287
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:21,310
in terms of learning about myself and I
certainly am more aware than ever of the

288
00:18:23,931 --> 00:18:26,900
triangles and really hope
I don't have any more.

289
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:31,150
I really hope so.
What I'm,

290
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:35,050
what I really enjoyed is
you, um, definitely were not,

291
00:18:35,051 --> 00:18:40,051
you were not afraid to talk
about uncomfortable things
and how you reinvented

292
00:18:41,111 --> 00:18:45,010
yourself. And it really how at any
age you can do that. If you're happy,

293
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,140
you're unhappy with something,
you can change it.

294
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,890
And if you're passionate about something,
if you follow that,

295
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,360
things will just kind of fall into place.

296
00:18:52,361 --> 00:18:55,110
Which I felt like it
happened a lot with you. Um,

297
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:59,980
do you have any advice for other
entrepreneurs who are looking to start a

298
00:18:59,981 --> 00:19:00,814
business?

299
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:04,550
I do. I think, you know,
we all want to do that now.

300
00:19:04,551 --> 00:19:08,240
We all want to be entrepreneurs and
come up with the next great idea.

301
00:19:08,241 --> 00:19:10,330
And you know,

302
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:14,930
this concept of finding your passion is,
is spoken about a lot.

303
00:19:14,931 --> 00:19:19,931
And I think I always like to tell people
that you just don't sit down one day

304
00:19:20,331 --> 00:19:22,130
and find your passion it.
Um,

305
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,130
and sometimes it comes to
you when you least expect it.

306
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,880
And after I gave up dancing,
which had been my passion my whole life,

307
00:19:28,881 --> 00:19:30,050
starting from age eight,

308
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:34,070
I never in a million years thought I
would ever be passionate about something

309
00:19:34,071 --> 00:19:34,820
else.

310
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:39,820
And the reason why I found
spin was really because,

311
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:41,410
um,

312
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:46,410
through a lot of years I just tried to
be open to all kinds of experiences and a

313
00:19:47,091 --> 00:19:50,900
lot of those experiences more negative
and didn't work for me. You know,

314
00:19:50,901 --> 00:19:55,580
I tried to work in an office and, uh, as
an office manager at a catering company,

315
00:19:55,581 --> 00:19:56,900
cause I was interested in food.

316
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:00,200
I did that after I gave up dancing cause
I had no idea what I was going to do.

317
00:20:00,201 --> 00:20:04,160
And you know what? I hated
it. And I learned that I
don't want to sit at a desk.

318
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:08,540
So that was informative. Um, after I,

319
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:13,140
as I was going through the
trauma of my divorce, I, um,

320
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:18,220
that's when I found spinning and I decided
one day again to just head into that

321
00:20:18,531 --> 00:20:22,970
kind of intimidating feelings,
Spin Room at the gym I belong to,

322
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,250
um, after several weeks of walking back
and forth. And should I or shouldn't I?

323
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:32,810
And one day, I don't know, something in
me said, oh, just go in there and try it.

324
00:20:32,811 --> 00:20:37,610
And I did. And that was when I found
spinning. But there was a lot in between.

325
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:42,611
And so I just think it's important to
have faith and know that you will find it

326
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,120
and uh,
it might not happen when you expect it to.

327
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,930
So you

328
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:53,880
recently left flywheel and very recently,

329
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,620
which I saw in December.

330
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:59,550
What are you most
excited to get into next?

331
00:20:59,551 --> 00:21:01,050
Or is it just kind of open ended?

332
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:06,530
Big Breath? Um, so I'm in
my noncompete period now,

333
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:11,240
so I can't really talk about what's next
and I don't know definitively what it

334
00:21:11,241 --> 00:21:13,070
is I'm trying to.

335
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:18,430
Right now my process is about having
actually lots of meetings with different

336
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:21,830
kinds of people and um,

337
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:27,080
figuring out what people want,
what's people still desire,

338
00:21:27,081 --> 00:21:31,010
you know, we're in this age of
everything going digital obviously,

339
00:21:31,011 --> 00:21:33,860
and people working out by
themselves in their home,

340
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:37,250
which is really kind of the opposite of,
of what I've always done.

341
00:21:37,251 --> 00:21:42,050
And so I'm getting, you know, a lot of
gathering a lot of information about,

342
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,471
you know,

343
00:21:42,471 --> 00:21:47,471
how much of a desire is there still a
for the group experience and working out

344
00:21:47,661 --> 00:21:51,110
together in building a
community, um, you know,

345
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,910
studying trends right now and,

346
00:21:53,911 --> 00:21:58,220
and letting that kind of helped
me get to that next decision.

347
00:21:58,221 --> 00:22:01,040
So I really don't know yet, but, um,

348
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:06,410
it will be in fitness of course, cause
that's what I do best. And uh, we'll see.

349
00:22:06,411 --> 00:22:07,244
It's exciting.

350
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,460
Um, touching on that a little bit
about working at, at home, um,

351
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:16,310
I read in the book that the owner or
the person that kind of invented Peloton

352
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:16,920
yes.

353
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:21,920
Approached you guys about partnering and
was it Lou that didn't want to go for

354
00:22:22,761 --> 00:22:27,380
it? It was wow. I mean, Miss, yes.

355
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:28,403
Right.
Yeah.

356
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,710
Specifically said if we're
going to get into that business,

357
00:22:32,711 --> 00:22:37,610
we'll do it ourselves. Um, and
that's, that was his belief. So yes.

358
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:41,800
Do what, what are your feelings on
the working out alone or, you know,

359
00:22:41,801 --> 00:22:44,770
having the interactive class as
opposed to being in the room? I mean,

360
00:22:44,771 --> 00:22:46,660
I know how I feel about it. Yeah. Um,

361
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:47,521
look,

362
00:22:47,521 --> 00:22:52,200
I feel like obviously it was
great opportunity for John and,

363
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:54,990
um,
he's done incredibly well.

364
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:58,170
The company's valued at 4 billion.

365
00:22:58,171 --> 00:23:01,560
I think at this they're adding treading.
I just thought I'd have a treadmill.

366
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:04,710
Yeah. And opponents as well. So, um,

367
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:09,090
obviously there's a market
for it and a need for it. Um,

368
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:14,210
I still firmly believe that there are
enough people out there who want the group

369
00:23:14,671 --> 00:23:17,250
experience.
And truthfully,

370
00:23:17,251 --> 00:23:22,251
so much of the success of both soul cycle
and fly wheel was the building of this

371
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:24,210
exceptional community.

372
00:23:24,211 --> 00:23:28,890
And the community obviously consists
of people sharing in this experience

373
00:23:28,891 --> 00:23:31,710
together and personally,
and I could be wrong.

374
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:36,711
I just feel that in this day and age of
so much disconnection and working out

375
00:23:38,821 --> 00:23:42,420
alone or being on our
phones all day, I, I,

376
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:45,920
I feel like human connection
will never really out of style.

377
00:23:45,921 --> 00:23:49,820
And I think it's always a need,
an innate need for us. And

378
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,360
I feel for that reason there
will always be a market and uh,

379
00:23:55,790 --> 00:24:00,500
enough people out there who want to kind
of go back to that and they feel that,

380
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:01,761
I'm just going to say it,

381
00:24:01,761 --> 00:24:06,761
I feel like in this huge expansion that
occurred for flywheel and soul cycle,

382
00:24:06,801 --> 00:24:08,480
I think a lot of that got lost.

383
00:24:08,481 --> 00:24:11,780
A lot of the community and that
high touch customer service.

384
00:24:11,781 --> 00:24:15,830
And so I kind of feel like there
is a need to bring it back.

385
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:20,500
And I do think that things go in full
circles. So I'm thinking a lot about that.

386
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:20,600
Yeah.

387
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,920
Yeah. I definitely think that there's a
lot more energy that you get when you're

388
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:29,480
physically in the class and working
out at home. I just personally for me,

389
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:34,070
if, if I'm more accountable
when I have people around me,

390
00:24:34,071 --> 00:24:36,410
then it's just me by myself.
Um,

391
00:24:36,411 --> 00:24:41,240
and I think a great instructor
also motivates you when
you're physically looking

392
00:24:41,241 --> 00:24:43,550
at them and they call out your
name like we talked about.

393
00:24:43,551 --> 00:24:46,250
It motivates you to push
even more to really,

394
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:50,120
really getting the
uncomfortable place. Um, right.

395
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:53,990
Because it's the connection you have
with the instructor and you will go very

396
00:24:53,991 --> 00:24:58,970
far for that one instructor. Yes.
It's amazing. It's amazing that,

397
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,540
um,

398
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:04,540
I feel your brand or brands because soul
cycle like that I know really popular

399
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:10,220
instructors or classes we'll book up
the second that it opens and people will

400
00:25:10,221 --> 00:25:14,750
pay extra to have the early
bookings for that reason. And um,

401
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:19,760
I feel like flywheels this a
different kind of experience. Um,

402
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:22,310
and I,
um,

403
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:27,800
it's more motivating to me when I have a
really good instructor I think keeps me

404
00:25:27,801 --> 00:25:31,790
accountable physically in class
and I would by myself at home.

405
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:36,830
I agree. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm
just some fun stuff now. Um,

406
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:39,790
and the book you talk about,
you know,

407
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:44,010
being able to travel more
after your children were
older and you guys have trips

408
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:47,120
that you take together and
how much you love to eat,

409
00:25:47,121 --> 00:25:50,780
which is also why you enjoy,
you know, working out so much.

410
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:54,680
What is been kind of your,
obviously I'm really into food.

411
00:25:54,681 --> 00:25:55,580
We talked about this as well.

412
00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:00,380
What has been your most favorite
kind of food experience?

413
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:05,620
Um,
I mean,

414
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:10,720
I'm not sure there was this a specific
one, but because my partner and I,

415
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,790
we're both equally into
to eating good food.

416
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,430
Literally every business
trip we would take,

417
00:26:15,431 --> 00:26:19,840
the first thing we would do is check out
the best restaurants in whatever city

418
00:26:19,841 --> 00:26:22,150
we went to. So, so it was great.

419
00:26:22,151 --> 00:26:26,620
So I had great dining experiences
in every city I went to. Um,

420
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:27,671
yeah,

421
00:26:27,671 --> 00:26:32,260
I mean the whole premise of flywheel
because of he and I was all about working

422
00:26:32,261 --> 00:26:33,094
hard,

423
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:38,310
playing hard and we were never
about deprivation or you know,

424
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,090
cut out this,
cut out that from your diet.

425
00:26:41,091 --> 00:26:43,770
It was all about kind of
eating whatever you want,

426
00:26:43,771 --> 00:26:48,510
drinking and just working out hard on
the fly wheel bike the next day you can't

427
00:26:48,511 --> 00:26:52,230
account. And that was our
mantra. So yeah. So it was just,

428
00:26:52,231 --> 00:26:54,480
I mean it was one of the reasons
why traveling with so much fun,

429
00:26:54,481 --> 00:26:57,540
it's because we got to experience so
many different kinds of restaurants.

430
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:00,400
Um,
when you guys are,

431
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:04,780
when you were a part of flywheel stow
and you were looking for instructors,

432
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,680
was there some kind of personality trait
or like what struck you about who you

433
00:27:08,681 --> 00:27:10,930
want it to bring in to teach?

434
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:15,710
We certainly hired instructors
who like to work hard and um,

435
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:20,630
motivate that way by being,
as we said, um, aspirational.

436
00:27:20,631 --> 00:27:23,180
That was our word.
When we were looking for an instructor,

437
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:26,540
they had to be aspirational,
whether it was, um,

438
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:31,540
because of their own physical prowess or,
um,

439
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:35,390
a certain x factor that was so
important that is so important in every

440
00:27:35,391 --> 00:27:36,224
instructor.

441
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:41,180
And that was actually a part of the
personality that was really hard to train.

442
00:27:41,181 --> 00:27:45,170
They kind of either had to have
it or they weren't hireable.

443
00:27:45,171 --> 00:27:46,790
So again,

444
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:50,810
some dynamic in their personality
that could draw a rider in, you know,

445
00:27:50,811 --> 00:27:53,510
on top of their physical strength.

446
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:59,810
Um, now I know that fly will recently,
maybe in the past couple of years added,

447
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:03,380
um, they give us previously called
fly beats. Now it's called tempo.

448
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:07,580
And that is similar ish to soul cycle,

449
00:28:07,581 --> 00:28:12,180
but it just has a little more
resistance than soul cycle tests. Um,

450
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,160
was there,

451
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:18,160
is that kind of the reason you added that
and for people who were more drawn to

452
00:28:18,201 --> 00:28:21,990
that kind of method but also
wanted the metrics to go with it.

453
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:27,800
So that was a really interesting
learning lesson. And the reason is yes,

454
00:28:27,801 --> 00:28:31,760
we decided to add it because it
was more about a rhythm ride,

455
00:28:31,761 --> 00:28:36,440
which is how the soul cycle ride is based.
And we thought,

456
00:28:36,441 --> 00:28:41,010
well we should add it and then we can
cast our net wider and hopefully drawn

457
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:44,870
some of those writers who specifically
like that kind of ride. Um,

458
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:50,080
what I realized in retrospect was I kind
of regretted it because I feel like do

459
00:28:51,531 --> 00:28:55,750
what you do well and really represent the,
um,

460
00:28:55,970 --> 00:29:00,970
specialness of your product and your
ride and don't feel that you have to get

461
00:29:02,301 --> 00:29:05,260
everyone there. There are enough
people out there, you know,

462
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:09,510
especially in big urban cities,
New York, obviously. Um,

463
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:14,690
there are enough people out there to
fill your rooms and why not just really

464
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:19,130
stick to what you do best.
And, um, and it just, yeah,

465
00:29:19,131 --> 00:29:23,780
it started to kind of dilute the product
and I wasn't really crazy about the

466
00:29:23,781 --> 00:29:24,890
idea to be honest with you.

467
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:30,550
How did you decide which locations
you would add it in to try it out?

468
00:29:30,551 --> 00:29:31,390
Just the bigger city.

469
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:33,800
Our initial,
uh,

470
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:38,430
way of identifying locations was
just open next to a whole foods.

471
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:42,160
It really was,
that was her formula open

472
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,810
next to whole foods and it always works.
Um,

473
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,980
we did mostly choose urban areas.

474
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:55,990
We did, however, um, what we would
do is we'd find an urban area,

475
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,370
a spot next to a whole
foods. And then, um,

476
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:03,340
we would open in a suburb close to the,

477
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,130
the initial,
um,

478
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:10,170
studio so that we could farm out our
instructors and they could actually teach

479
00:30:10,181 --> 00:30:14,830
at both locations. And it was a great
way to utilize our instructor team.

480
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:19,510
So we did add suburban locations as well.
They,

481
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:24,430
there were exceptions, but,
um, they, some did really well.

482
00:30:24,431 --> 00:30:27,910
Some didn't. Um, we just
found the formula of,

483
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:31,460
we found it much safer to
open in urban areas, um,

484
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,360
more than suburban areas. And, um,

485
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:38,260
I think that in urban for some
reason in some suburban areas,

486
00:30:38,261 --> 00:30:40,570
even if they were wealthy areas,

487
00:30:40,571 --> 00:30:44,230
people didn't want to spend money
as much as they do in, in the city.

488
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:48,160
And that was an interesting
learning experience as well.

489
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:50,290
I was just going to say
when I just thought of this,

490
00:30:50,291 --> 00:30:53,080
when we opened in Scarsdale for example,
you know,

491
00:30:53,081 --> 00:30:54,610
I didn't think about the fact that,

492
00:30:54,611 --> 00:30:58,780
and I learned this from our Scarsdale
writers. Um, they would say to me,

493
00:30:58,781 --> 00:31:01,420
we don't want to Pay New York prices.
That's why we moved to Scarsdale.

494
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:06,690
And it was like, oh, that makes sense.
Um, they would complain all the time.

495
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,230
What,
um,

496
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:14,760
what has been your most
favorite experience that
you've been able to do because

497
00:31:14,761 --> 00:31:19,740
of flywheel or in soul cycle? Like
something that you'd wear, like wow,

498
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:22,560
I can't believe this is
happening. Writing the book. Yeah.

499
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:26,630
I never in a million years
thought I would ever be an author,

500
00:31:26,631 --> 00:31:28,280
but ironically,

501
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:32,290
and this kind of is consistent
with staying open to things. Um,

502
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:33,740
when I was going through,

503
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,910
I went through my divorce and I was really
a fish out of water and have no idea

504
00:31:37,911 --> 00:31:39,140
what I was going to do in my life.

505
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:44,590
And I decided to take a course in
memoir writing completely randomly.

506
00:31:45,141 --> 00:31:48,860
Um, I knew that I always liked to write
but just thought, oh, that'll be fun.

507
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:49,640
And so it's,

508
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,690
I never again in a million years thought
I would ever write a book or a memoir,

509
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,900
but it was just maybe that
was foreshadowing. I Dunno.

510
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:02,050
Thank you so much for coming. You're
welcome. Thank you for that early set.

511
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,790
Such a great time talking with you today.

512
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:07,900
I'm going to open it up for questions
now if you want to walk up to the

513
00:32:07,901 --> 00:32:08,830
microphones.

514
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:15,220
Thank you so much for coming. Huge. Yeah,

515
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:21,300
I'd love to hear more about
the relationship dynamics
of your cofounders at soul

516
00:32:21,301 --> 00:32:24,240
cycle cause it sounds like
you were approached by Juan
and that had brought the

517
00:32:24,241 --> 00:32:28,320
other one in and then sort of you
wound up out of the mix and having uh,

518
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:31,890
founded a startup where we had a
cofounder breakup. I'm over time.

519
00:32:31,891 --> 00:32:33,750
I'm just interested to learn,
like how did you,

520
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,710
what were the things that you were,

521
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:37,950
what went wrong and sort of what were
the things you were looking for the next

522
00:32:37,951 --> 00:32:40,070
time when you started
the flywheel and maybe

523
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:41,360
even moving on now,

524
00:32:41,361 --> 00:32:43,730
like what are some of the things that
are top of line as you think about your

525
00:32:43,731 --> 00:32:44,564
next venture?

526
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:49,560
Great question. I have to be a little
careful about what exactly happened,

527
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:55,200
uh, on that day at soul
cycle. But, um, in retrospect,

528
00:32:55,860 --> 00:33:00,860
I've really learned a lot about the
dynamic that the three of us had and the

529
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:03,570
mistakes that were made on my part.

530
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:08,490
And it's been such a growing experience
for me learning through these mistakes

531
00:33:08,491 --> 00:33:11,490
and as I talk about in the book,
um,

532
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:16,890
and his charities so aptly pointed
out the whole triangle thing,

533
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,460
which started with my parents,
um,

534
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:24,070
really was replicated in that
business partnership. Um,

535
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:29,180
and I ended up being comfortable in a
role that unfortunately was comfortable

536
00:33:31,921 --> 00:33:36,050
for me, which was a role of
kind of taking the back seat,

537
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:40,640
kind of being overpowered, being, um,

538
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:44,220
what felt like bullied.
Um,

539
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,750
and

540
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:52,400
quite frankly, not being strong
enough at various points of the,

541
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:57,890
of my time. It's all cycle, not being
strong enough to stand up for myself. And,

542
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,753
um,

543
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:02,980
ultimately it worked against me and um,

544
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:08,600
I certainly had a lot of
learning experiences to bring
to my next partnership at

545
00:34:08,601 --> 00:34:11,330
flywheel. That was
drastically different. Um,

546
00:34:11,331 --> 00:34:14,630
so as I talk about that
question in the book, it's,

547
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:19,740
it's really about self awareness and
doing the work to get to know yourself

548
00:34:20,661 --> 00:34:21,710
however that plays,

549
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:26,750
however that workplace out and not
repeating patterns and not making the same

550
00:34:26,901 --> 00:34:27,734
mistakes.

551
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,990
Hi there.
Hi.

552
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:37,080
Another huge fan you got me through
like my pregnancy and every and the last

553
00:34:38,141 --> 00:34:42,100
eight. Awesome. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you so much. You're welcome.

554
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:46,900
And I travel a lot for work
and I oftentimes find myself
booking hotels that are

555
00:34:46,901 --> 00:34:51,901
closer to fly occasions because I know
that even in the change of my routine,

556
00:34:52,541 --> 00:34:55,570
I still get the experience
I want in cardio.

557
00:34:55,571 --> 00:34:59,590
And you still feel like New York and
the energy you need for the day. Um,

558
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:03,820
can you talk a little bit about how
the expansion strategy worked with also

559
00:35:03,821 --> 00:35:07,510
making sure that you had the same
culture and energy and type of trainers?

560
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:10,850
They do differ a bit
occasions. Yes. Asian. Um,

561
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:14,350
but how you keep the consistency of the
brand with such a massive expansion.

562
00:35:14,351 --> 00:35:15,160
Yeah,

563
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:19,240
so I'm not going to lie. It's, and
you actually just pointed it out when,

564
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:24,700
when the expansion got to a certain
point and it was really big.

565
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:26,440
It was hard.

566
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:31,470
It's hard to maintain the culture
and up until a certain point,

567
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:32,440
um,

568
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:37,440
we were able to maintain it and I
really feel that change happened.

569
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,620
Um,

570
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:45,420
when we were taking over and when we
were acquired at that point we had 22

571
00:35:45,421 --> 00:35:50,370
studios, which still a lot.
Um, and I always say this,

572
00:35:50,371 --> 00:35:53,730
it's not rocket science.
My partner and I, Jay, um,

573
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:57,450
our third partner kind of stayed in the
background and did more a real estate

574
00:35:57,451 --> 00:35:58,081
and finance.

575
00:35:58,081 --> 00:36:03,081
But Jay and I were in the forefront and
I was the face and Jay was in operations

576
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:06,630
and really ran the business.
And as simple as this sounds,

577
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:11,631
Jay and I were both are both
very nice people and um,

578
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,550
we have unfortunately we both had this
quality where we really need to be liked

579
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:21,480
by everybody, which is not
always a really great quality,

580
00:36:21,481 --> 00:36:22,830
but we both had it.

581
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:27,830
And so there's such a trickle down
phenomenon that happens from the top.

582
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:33,380
And as a result we just amassed
this amazing group of people.

583
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:39,300
And it also had a lot to do with
how we treated our employees and we,

584
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:42,900
we considered our employees to
be as important as our customers.

585
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:45,570
And it didn't matter what your role was,

586
00:36:45,571 --> 00:36:50,250
it didn't matter if you were
mopping floors or your a senior VP.

587
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:54,780
Um, everybody was treated the same.
And I think that because of that,

588
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:59,220
we just ended up, you
know, really great, nice,

589
00:36:59,221 --> 00:37:02,880
wonderful people gravitated to us
and want it to work with us. And,

590
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,570
and that's why we would always call
it the fly family, the fly fam,

591
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:10,530
because we all really felt like a family.
But no question.

592
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,900
As we expanded and they
expand expansion continued.

593
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,710
That's what I talked about before where,
um,

594
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:21,360
that specialness kind of,
you know, was compromised.

595
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,120
I also love studying all
things fitness trends.

596
00:37:25,121 --> 00:37:26,950
So love that your internet as well.

597
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:31,630
What are some of the studios or concepts
or things that you're really looking at

598
00:37:31,631 --> 00:37:35,470
that are doing it right right now and
as you're thinking about your future,

599
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,990
what insights do you think you
would want to take from them?

600
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:43,510
So it's interesting because when I hear
about other successful boutique fitness

601
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:47,240
businesses,
we were talking about rumble for example,

602
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:52,010
the ones that I hear a lot of
excitement about our, again,

603
00:37:52,011 --> 00:37:56,390
the ones where people are,
are gravitating toward the community.

604
00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:00,050
And so I've heard that a lot about rumble.
And um,

605
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,850
there was actually a
really interesting article,

606
00:38:01,851 --> 00:38:06,680
I don't know if you guys saw that
came out recently. Inbox. And she,

607
00:38:06,681 --> 00:38:09,980
the writer talked about,
um,

608
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,450
this concept of expansion and how,
um,

609
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:17,010
she talks a lot about flywheel
and soul cycle and um,

610
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:22,220
talk to about her opinion was that they
kind of lost their focus and identity

611
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:27,430
and she spent a lot of time talking about
boutique and how the smaller studios

612
00:38:27,741 --> 00:38:32,720
that are coming up now are actually
doing better and people are going back to

613
00:38:32,721 --> 00:38:33,081
that.

614
00:38:33,081 --> 00:38:37,390
And so I found that really interesting
terms of trends and things going full

615
00:38:37,391 --> 00:38:39,240
circle. But, um,

616
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:44,770
I hear a lot about rumble boxing seems
to really be taking, taking on. Um,

617
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,720
I do feel that,
you know,

618
00:38:46,721 --> 00:38:50,940
things have changed so much since the
days of soul cycle starting and flywheel

619
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:55,720
starting. Um, and I'm about to
lose my train of thought. Um,

620
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:59,620
I know. And so what's
been happening, again,

621
00:38:59,621 --> 00:39:04,150
the whole full circle thing is a lot of
these boutique businesses that started

622
00:39:04,151 --> 00:39:05,110
boutique started out as,

623
00:39:05,111 --> 00:39:10,060
but boutique have now expanded
their modalities and um, you know,

624
00:39:10,061 --> 00:39:14,020
a flywheel or soul cycle started adding
a lot of different kinds of classes.

625
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:18,580
And now we see a lot of these studios
with five different offerings. And,

626
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:22,150
and in a sense that feels
to me like, oh, so the,

627
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:27,210
the what started out as a very dedicated
boutique business has now actually

628
00:39:27,701 --> 00:39:31,360
morphed into the big box gym, which
is how we started in the first place.

629
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:35,400
So if I were to start again,
um,

630
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:39,910
spoiler alert. Um, and I don't, you
know, I haven't committed to anything,

631
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:43,760
but I think that if I did
start a brick and mortar,

632
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:48,460
if I did do another brick and mortar,
it would never be about one offering,

633
00:39:48,461 --> 00:39:53,260
which is what it could be about initially.
But I probably have too.

634
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:57,790
And that would be it. I wouldn't want
to make it any bigger than that. And,

635
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,530
um,
as I said before,

636
00:39:59,531 --> 00:40:04,531
I think that the community aspect and
that connecting with people is never going

637
00:40:04,961 --> 00:40:07,760
to fall out of favor.
You're welcome,

638
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:11,020
but said right.

639
00:40:11,021 --> 00:40:14,650
I thought it was interesting and it made
me look really good, so I liked that.

640
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:21,000
Hi. Hi. First of all, thank you for making
an android APP. Finally. That was awesome.

641
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,790
You're welcome. Um, I have two questions.

642
00:40:23,791 --> 00:40:26,730
One is what is your personal fitness
routine? Are you still spinning?

643
00:40:26,731 --> 00:40:29,910
Do you teach? And my
second question is, um,

644
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:34,350
there's a lot of new trends in terms of
virtual reality where bikes are actually

645
00:40:34,351 --> 00:40:36,840
moving in the rooms or music videos.

646
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:40,320
Do you think those are all
gimmicks or are they actually, uh,

647
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,290
contributing something to the,

648
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:47,380
and so it's hard to answer that
without my own personal, uh, opinion.

649
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:52,330
I, you know, for myself, I,
they do seem gimmicky to me.

650
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:57,160
It's just my opinion. Um, I,
you know, I left, as I said,

651
00:40:57,161 --> 00:40:59,080
I left flywheel December 31st,

652
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:03,670
but up until December 31st I was
teaching six to seven classes a week.

653
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:07,210
Um,
I can't ever imagine not teaching.

654
00:41:07,211 --> 00:41:11,740
It's just what I do and I
love it and it never gets old.

655
00:41:11,741 --> 00:41:14,920
And sourcing to charity.
I've been teaching on,

656
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:19,210
I've been on a bike for
21 years. Um, sadly,

657
00:41:19,211 --> 00:41:22,930
I hate to even talk about this,
but I am a nursing,

658
00:41:22,931 --> 00:41:25,840
a back injury right now.
So a lower back injury.

659
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:29,080
So for the first time in 2021 years,

660
00:41:29,081 --> 00:41:33,710
I'm off the bike and I'm not doing
anything except going to physical therapy.

661
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:35,270
So,
um,

662
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:39,710
it'll be interesting to see if anything
changes being off the bike. I mean,

663
00:41:39,711 --> 00:41:43,430
I think one of the reasons why I've been
such an advocate for spending is that

664
00:41:43,431 --> 00:41:47,870
it's actually so safe and it's low impact
and people can do it at any age and

665
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:50,650
you know, so whatever's going
on in my back, you know,

666
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:55,040
maybe it's a overuse and just
long term kind of situation.

667
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:56,330
Hopefully it'll get better soon.

668
00:41:56,630 --> 00:42:01,310
But at the same time I am an advocate
to mixing it up and not just doing,

669
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,970
doing one modality.
Um,

670
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:09,210
I was doing SLT for a while and I
enjoyed that. It's so challenging. Um,

671
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,610
and then of late,

672
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:15,470
I've been incorporating Pilati into my
routine because I think politics is so

673
00:42:15,471 --> 00:42:18,690
challenging, but really
effective. I want to ask about

674
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,990
the book, which is your newest baby. And
what I'm fascinated by is obviously you,

675
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:24,950
you've left an amazing legacy,

676
00:42:24,951 --> 00:42:29,630
but also as a business woman who's done
very well as you were thinking about the

677
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:33,050
book and all the many things you can
write about and I'm sure you had an eye on

678
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:35,630
kind of the business aspect of
what is the most interesting,

679
00:42:35,631 --> 00:42:38,330
how do you get the most viewers
and readers and whatnot?

680
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,620
How did you decide what to cover in the
book and what to emphasize on and how to

681
00:42:42,621 --> 00:42:43,454
position it?

682
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,720
The beginning,
I'm sorry,

683
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:52,750
the genesis of the book really happened
by me just sitting down and starting to

684
00:42:55,131 --> 00:42:58,850
write personal anecdotes.
That's how I started it. Um,

685
00:42:58,851 --> 00:43:02,690
I worked with a collaborator because I
really didn't know how to start and she

686
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:04,250
posed that to me.
She said,

687
00:43:04,251 --> 00:43:09,251
what about sitting down and writing
10 stories that come to mind,

688
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:13,310
uh, through the course of your life?
And, and so that's how I started.

689
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:16,790
And so it really started,
I think from a personal place.

690
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:22,090
And then I was quickly able to draw
lessons from personal experiences,

691
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:27,950
lessons that I learned in life and,
and then applied them to business.

692
00:43:27,951 --> 00:43:31,940
So that's kind of how that theme happened.
And it really,

693
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:36,710
you know,
came the whole idea to do it that way.

694
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:41,570
Just happened really organically
and really easily. And again,

695
00:43:41,571 --> 00:43:42,201
it made,

696
00:43:42,201 --> 00:43:47,201
it was very consistent with me because
I am all about not being afraid of

697
00:43:48,831 --> 00:43:52,640
sharing personal stories and
that's how I connect with people.

698
00:43:52,641 --> 00:43:57,350
So it just made sense. More organic
versus like a market research. Absolutely.

699
00:43:57,470 --> 00:44:02,390
Much more organic, which again made sense
for me since no business experience.

700
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:05,920
And I don't have another question. I just
want to say you look amazing. Thank you.

701
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:06,773
Oh,

702
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,410
I have to say I was a little disappointed
because usually it comes out in my

703
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:17,510
talks that I'm 60 and it usually
gets a huge response. Guys were like,

704
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:20,750
yeah, whatever. So thank you.

705
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,550
Are there any more questions?
I'll hear air.

706
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:29,000
I'm also nursing an injury and I'm
of daytime runner, so I said, oh,

707
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:32,280
how terrible that and
disruptive in your life.

708
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:37,280
[inaudible] and PG. So sand.
But, um, I wanted to like,

709
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:41,940
learn a little bit more
about the marketing aspect
of the flywheel brand. Um,

710
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,550
I'm an ad sales here at Google and
I always think it's interesting,

711
00:44:44,551 --> 00:44:47,820
especially in a super competitive
environment like fitness,

712
00:44:47,821 --> 00:44:52,821
especially with the rise of social media
and just all of the community aspects

713
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:53,431
of it.

714
00:44:53,431 --> 00:44:58,230
But how do you still make paid advertising
and paid marketing really work for

715
00:44:58,231 --> 00:45:01,710
your brand and actually drive results?
So I'd love to hear more about that.

716
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:03,300
Sure. So, um,

717
00:45:03,301 --> 00:45:07,140
we never advertised ever this business,

718
00:45:07,141 --> 00:45:11,970
so word of mouth, um, we never
needed two things have changed now.

719
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:16,860
Um, and it's interesting,
uh, marketing and branding.

720
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:20,610
When we, I remember specifically
when we started flywheel,

721
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:24,990
we really had no idea what our
brand was going to look like.

722
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:28,140
And people would say, well, what's your
brand? And my partner and I would say,

723
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,340
I don't, we don't know. Um,

724
00:45:30,341 --> 00:45:35,310
and we just started the business and
the brand came to us and you know,

725
00:45:35,311 --> 00:45:40,200
through kind of trial and error. And it
was just a way to figure out who we were.

726
00:45:40,201 --> 00:45:45,201
And then we actually hired a marketing
team to work with us about a year in and

727
00:45:48,271 --> 00:45:53,040
they were the ones who came up with the
idea of never coast. And I, we love that.

728
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:56,640
And so that really became
a game changer for us.

729
00:45:56,641 --> 00:45:59,160
And that was something we could really,
um,

730
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:03,690
hang on to and build
a marketing plan from.

731
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:05,753
Yeah.

732
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:11,810
I have a question about like the pricing
and how you came up with that because

733
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:13,040
soul cycle,
uh,

734
00:46:13,041 --> 00:46:16,660
to me it seems like one of the first
kind of boutique or the most well known

735
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:21,130
early boutique places and like I was
wondering how you guys came up with like

736
00:46:21,131 --> 00:46:24,970
the pricing strategy and having no
memberships and stuff like this at a gym.

737
00:46:24,971 --> 00:46:27,330
And then if you like if
it was like a conscious,

738
00:46:27,331 --> 00:46:30,310
this isn't a change of mind
when going to fly wheel.

739
00:46:30,311 --> 00:46:33,200
I'm just basically wondering like how did
you know that people are going to want

740
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:37,450
to pay like this type of money
to do a boutique fitness class?

741
00:46:37,451 --> 00:46:40,030
Cause it doesn't really seem like
people were doing that before.

742
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:44,720
Purely ripped it off from
cell cycle. We did. I mean,

743
00:46:44,721 --> 00:46:45,700
we just used,

744
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:50,740
looked at their model as to how
they priced and replicated it.

745
00:46:51,321 --> 00:46:55,280
We knew that they were getting it because
the business was booming at that point

746
00:46:55,281 --> 00:46:59,750
when I left. And, um, and so
that's how we did it. However,

747
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:05,240
over time we changed, um, our, our, um,

748
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:10,360
strategy because they became in through
their pricing even more elitist.

749
00:47:12,231 --> 00:47:14,540
And we really wanted to
move away from that. I mean,

750
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:19,550
they offered their supersoul for
$70 for 45 minutes spin class.

751
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:23,000
And we see that just wasn't us,
it wasn't our identity.

752
00:47:23,001 --> 00:47:25,760
And we really wanted to,
um,

753
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:31,150
build a business that was
about inclusiveness and soul
cycle to us seemed like a

754
00:47:32,381 --> 00:47:36,250
business that was about
exclusiveness. So that, um,

755
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:40,810
was very important in how
we went about our pricing.

756
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:45,160
I personally was not in charge
of that part of the business,

757
00:47:45,161 --> 00:47:49,210
so I can't speak with too
much detail about it, but, um,

758
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:52,660
I know that the membership idea
really took off for us and was,

759
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:56,350
and people love the membership because
they could really get in a lot of classes

760
00:47:56,351 --> 00:47:59,890
for a lot less money. Well,
thank you. You're welcome.

761
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:04,760
What I do love is that you give
this Ben shoes for free rental,

762
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:09,150
whereas soul cycle, I think it was like
three or $4. Yeah. And water. Yeah.

763
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,240
For one as well.
Yeah.

764
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:12,460
Which is great because you don't have
to bring anything with you, which is it

765
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:12,961
amazing.

766
00:48:12,961 --> 00:48:16,290
And that was another way in which we
started the business and figure it out.

767
00:48:16,291 --> 00:48:19,140
Things was obviously I was
coming from soul cycle.

768
00:48:19,141 --> 00:48:24,141
And so what better way than for
me to look back on soul cycle and,

769
00:48:25,101 --> 00:48:29,310
and know what worked and what didn't
work and the things that worked we,

770
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:31,920
we kept and the things that didn't work,
we changed.

771
00:48:31,921 --> 00:48:36,870
And one of the things I knew from the
rider experience was they would come to

772
00:48:36,871 --> 00:48:38,370
take class and then,
oh,

773
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:41,280
they'd have to take out their wallet
again to pay for water or take out their

774
00:48:41,281 --> 00:48:44,280
wallet to pay for shoes.
And they really kind of resented it.

775
00:48:44,281 --> 00:48:48,090
So that was just one example of how we
thought we're going to do away with that.

776
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,550
And one last question.
Okay, good. Last question.

777
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:56,950
So we have spins to you on the 14th floor.
I saw it once.

778
00:48:56,951 --> 00:49:01,120
You're back gets back in order.
Are the chances you come and teach us?

779
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:06,500
I was actually thinking about that.
I really, we can help organize.

780
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:11,990
Oh yeah, I'll do it. No,

781
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,390
I'm actually wondering if like

782
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:17,120
that would interfere with my
noncompete. But I mean, come on

783
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:20,240
Tony, while anybody, okay, I'm here.

784
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:24,780
I'm not at work cause I never got to
take your class. I would love to do it.

785
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:25,890
Thank you for inviting me.

786
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:30,090
I'm Ruth will be upstairs
to sign books after,

787
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:32,160
so if everyone wants to Q upstairs,

788
00:49:32,161 --> 00:49:36,180
