1
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:10,870
I'm really delighted to be here and
uh, hope we can have a dialogue, uh,

2
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:15,630
after I speak a little bit about my
book. Um, so yeah, far from scaring you,

3
00:00:15,631 --> 00:00:20,631
I think I want to reassure you initially
that creating a is really something

4
00:00:20,731 --> 00:00:23,670
that we all do every day of our lives.

5
00:00:23,671 --> 00:00:27,720
It's one of the most fundamental
biological processes. And to frame that,

6
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,140
it's pretty clear that there's hardly
a condition and the course of your day

7
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,320
that you encounter that's
fully predictable or predicted,

8
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:41,670
you encounter it and you act in
a fundamentally creative way.

9
00:00:41,671 --> 00:00:43,050
You go right there,
you go left.

10
00:00:43,051 --> 00:00:46,860
And that may be a trivial
creative act or a consequential,

11
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:50,070
a trivia creative act.
But in any case,

12
00:00:50,071 --> 00:00:53,070
it matters to you in the moment that
you do it or you wouldn't have done it.

13
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:58,490
Occasionally those creative acts lead
to creative things and those created

14
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:04,101
things may be anything from
a well articulated sentence
to a pure wet to a book.

15
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,370
And those things matter to you when you
create them or you wouldn't create them.

16
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:14,030
Now it has turned out to be in our
interest to create not only for ourselves,

17
00:01:15,181 --> 00:01:16,950
things that matter,

18
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,540
but also things that matter
for many of those around us.

19
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:26,310
The clan and the wellbeing of the clan
tends to correlate with our own personal

20
00:01:26,311 --> 00:01:28,020
wellbeing.
And therefore over time,

21
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:31,650
our biology has pushed us to think
about creating things that matter,

22
00:01:31,651 --> 00:01:36,651
not just to ourselves right now but to
others and for a fairly long period of

23
00:01:37,111 --> 00:01:40,770
time. And so if you look over the course
of human history at created things,

24
00:01:40,771 --> 00:01:44,390
whether it's an equation or a wheel,
uh,

25
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,480
these things have tended to, uh,
involve of course, collaboration,

26
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,800
a discussion,

27
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:53,910
kind of figuring out what matters to
the clan and pooling of resources. And,

28
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,420
and when we finally made something,
we've tended to make it to last,

29
00:01:57,421 --> 00:02:01,500
not just for the moment when we created
it for some relatively long period of

30
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:05,170
time. And therefore villages
and pyramids and shoes, uh,

31
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,640
tended for most of history
to last quite a long time.

32
00:02:08,641 --> 00:02:13,641
Fast forward to where we are today and
we're in a moment that in a way is the

33
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,550
pinnacle achievement of human creativity.

34
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,350
And if you read Steven Pinker's
recent book, clearly, uh,

35
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,970
by most indicators,

36
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:27,720
the human condition is better off today
by human creativity than it ever has

37
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:28,320
been.

38
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:33,150
But one of the uniquenesses of our
moment is that the created things that

39
00:02:33,151 --> 00:02:35,550
surround us are remarkably short lived.

40
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,330
And the reason for that is a multiple,

41
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:44,010
firstly among the things that we have a
limited supply of his time and therefore

42
00:02:44,011 --> 00:02:49,011
in all of history when we have and
have had a chance to create something a

43
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:52,950
tomorrow versus creating something that
matters to us the day after tomorrow,

44
00:02:52,951 --> 00:02:56,160
we sort of focus on tomorrow time matters.

45
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,670
And over the last 300 years,
and especially over the last 30 years,

46
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:04,210
the power of science and technology has
made it possible to create things of

47
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:07,300
mass utility really rapidly.

48
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:11,920
And it's led to this increasing focus
on creating things over a really short

49
00:03:11,921 --> 00:03:12,521
period of time.

50
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:17,080
And that's skewed our perception of what
creativity is and really led me to the

51
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:19,210
writing of this book. It's
also created, of course,

52
00:03:19,211 --> 00:03:23,830
this situation a highlighted by the
United Nations and their identification of

53
00:03:23,831 --> 00:03:28,831
the 17 sustainable development goals
of a world that is in a risk of,

54
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,510
uh, no sustainability and
therefore many today are focusing,

55
00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:39,511
whether it's on feeding the planet or
saving life in the sea or preserving the

56
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:44,701
environment in some way on creating
over a long period of time.

57
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,990
Now I'd like to just talk
for a little bit about, uh,

58
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:53,080
creating and this concept of learning.

59
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:58,470
If you think about the sort of
canonical, uh, creator environment, uh,

60
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:02,560
you probably think about a
scientific lab, which is indeed, uh,

61
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:07,570
responsible for much of the,
created a world around us today.

62
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:11,020
And if you think about what
happens in a scientific lab,

63
00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:13,390
you probably have in mind the
scientific method. And indeed,

64
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:16,300
the scientific method is one of the
things that goes on in a science lab.

65
00:04:16,301 --> 00:04:20,260
We tend to focus on phenomena
whose laws we understand. Uh,

66
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:25,261
we frame those phenomena in conditions
that are really well specified and we

67
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:30,580
apply the scientific method and we observe
and to do so. And we make discoveries.

68
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,200
However, in pioneering work, uh,

69
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:38,050
in science and engineering
and other domains,

70
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:43,060
we tend to have either not perfect
understanding of the phenomena nor perfect

71
00:04:43,061 --> 00:04:44,890
understanding of the
conditions that frame them.

72
00:04:44,891 --> 00:04:49,540
And as much as analysis and
deduction matters in the science lab,

73
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,020
actually intuition and
imagination matters too.

74
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:57,850
And therefore the scientific process and
science labs or an engineering labs and

75
00:04:57,851 --> 00:05:02,851
labs generally is a combination of the
classical scientific method and what I

76
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:07,630
call an artistic method.
It blends this induction deduction,

77
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,900
a comfort with uncertainty and ability
to frame a problem and move on into a

78
00:05:13,121 --> 00:05:16,690
single process that over the last 10 or
15 years I've been talking about as an

79
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,200
art science process. Now,
if you take the metaphor,

80
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:24,280
the science lab and you apply it to
your lives here at Google or to your

81
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:25,150
personal lives,

82
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:30,660
this balance of art and science still
holds and there's probably a lot more art

83
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:35,710
that, uh, is involved in science. And
you can take any example. An example,

84
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:37,180
for example,
of losing your watch.

85
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,880
You make a hypothesis that you're
watching is under your bed.

86
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,910
You then test your hypothesis
by looking for, you're watching,

87
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:46,240
you make a discovery and so on and so
forth. And that's generally how we, uh,

88
00:05:46,241 --> 00:05:47,800
encounter,
um,

89
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:53,010
opportunity and a need in our lives
and by this balance of art and science.

90
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:57,220
Now in my book, I talk about, um,

91
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:02,740
this notion of an aesthetic work or
aesthetics and a lot of thinking over the

92
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:08,850
last century, particularly
around aesthetics as being, uh,

93
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,040
closely coupled with a kind
of mindful way of living.

94
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,620
And if you look at the most
mindful of experiments,

95
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:20,150
the works that come from those, whether
it's a scientific article or a relief,

96
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,580
um,
can be thought of as aesthetic works.

97
00:06:22,581 --> 00:06:26,660
And I'd like to talk about aesthetics were
aesthetic works just for a little bit.

98
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:31,150
If you look over the course of history
at, uh, things that we've made, um,

99
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,810
through experimental processes,

100
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:37,070
whether they're books or plays or,

101
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,010
uh, reliefs, uh,

102
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:44,050
they have generally invited a reaction
from the public of observation,

103
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,350
uh, and learning. Uh, and, uh,

104
00:06:48,351 --> 00:06:52,280
that has led to how we structure
our universities, our museums,

105
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:56,720
and even our companies and
stores. If you look, however,

106
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:01,810
at the last 30 years or so at cultural
works and a works of technology indeed.

107
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,900
Um,
as you produce here at Google,

108
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:09,110
they invite a very different
kind of public experience.

109
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:13,700
This here is an image from Olafur.
Eliasson is 2004,

110
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:16,850
a weather project at the Tate modern.
Uh,

111
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:21,350
a kind of son was created and the, um, uh,

112
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:26,150
Tate modern and, uh, people were
invited to observe. And of course,

113
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,450
nobody had any idea how people
would observe an x to the,

114
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,720
ended up laying on their backs and
they ended up making formations.

115
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:34,580
There's a whole story about how
the weather project was a lived,

116
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:38,960
but they became part of the,
uh, the, uh, the cultural work.

117
00:07:38,961 --> 00:07:43,790
And that's indeed what's
happened in technology in media.

118
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:48,290
If you look at something
like a smart phone, uh,

119
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:51,260
as which invites me to
engage in my engagement,

120
00:07:51,261 --> 00:07:52,970
changes the phone in a certain way,

121
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,030
just as Google has changed
by me using Google.

122
00:07:56,031 --> 00:08:00,160
And so there's this increasing
participation of the public, uh,

123
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:03,620
with the creator and we're all
kind of creating a together.

124
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:08,440
And I say all of that just to say
that the notion of learning, um,

125
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,170
indeed,

126
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:14,170
even of commerce as being one of a
producer and a consumer is going away and

127
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:22,180
it's actually has a radical impact and
how we think about learning at Harvard

128
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,200
University and ultimately,
um, probably doing business.

129
00:08:27,201 --> 00:08:31,550
And so I've been focused over
the last 15 years on the, uh,

130
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,190
synonymous nature of, uh, learning, uh,

131
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,100
about tomorrow and creating tomorrow.
And, uh, particularly focusing on,

132
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,590
among other things a little kids. My book
begins with a story about a little kid.

133
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,880
Uh, if you think about the ultimate
pioneers, um, they are little kids, right?

134
00:08:49,881 --> 00:08:54,620
They're encountering conditions that are
radically new and they are learning at

135
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:58,960
an rate. And if all is, uh,

136
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,080
particularly supportive,
they're having fun.

137
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,810
And so this is something that I come
back to very frequently with being

138
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:08,040
motivated, not for a commercial purpose
or for making a name for themselves,

139
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:11,820
but they're just sort of
fascinated, super curious and, uh,

140
00:09:11,821 --> 00:09:15,690
and they're learning now, particularly
in my book, I focus on pioneers,

141
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,230
pioneering creators who are creating
of a very long period of time.

142
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,580
And actually in quite risky
and uncertain conditions.

143
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:28,850
And I focus on the emotive and cognitive
dimensions that lead to not only

144
00:09:31,831 --> 00:09:36,780
successful pioneering, creating,
but also a deep pleasure.

145
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,750
And to give you just a little insight,

146
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:43,380
one of the creators who I spent time with,
David [inaudible],

147
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,440
who's one of the great
marine photographers of our
time and invented the split

148
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:56,790
screen or the split Lens for
photographing above and below water.

149
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:01,860
And I was talking to David about the
quality's important in a buddy, uh, in,

150
00:10:01,861 --> 00:10:04,410
in diving deep into the ocean.
And just to point out,

151
00:10:04,411 --> 00:10:08,720
as I'll mention more here in
the last part of my talk, uh,

152
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,380
when we pioneer, uh, we tend
to pioneer best not alone. Uh,

153
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,000
and now we're not
clearly not in a village,

154
00:10:15,001 --> 00:10:18,290
but we tend to have a team of buddy and,
uh,

155
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,360
who's thinking of our interest and we are
thinking of her interest in that tends

156
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:27,000
to maximize or optimize our survival.

157
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,990
And it's obviously true in diving
in the ocean. I asked Dave,

158
00:10:29,991 --> 00:10:31,830
but what are the qualities that
matter most to you? And he said, well,

159
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:34,440
the second most important probably,
which was interesting, uh,

160
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,570
that he started with that
was that they'd be kind,

161
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:40,620
and it's kind of nothing worse than
diving with somebody and kind of risking

162
00:10:40,621 --> 00:10:44,190
your life with somebody who
is just fundamentally not
kind. And, uh, so I said,

163
00:10:44,191 --> 00:10:47,130
well, what's the first most important,
uh, quality? And he said, well,

164
00:10:47,131 --> 00:10:50,940
they need to be passionately curious.
And so obviously at a frontier,

165
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:55,920
if you're not a waking up and
motivated to, uh, explore that,

166
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:59,100
nobody will be right. So this
passionate curiosity, empathy,

167
00:10:59,101 --> 00:11:03,890
these are the kinds of emotive and
cognitive interventions that I focus on in

168
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:08,760
the book. And I look at creators like
Ferran Adria, the chef of El Bulli,

169
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,810
uh, which closed down in 2011, arguably
the greatest chef living today.

170
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:18,050
And I look at their creative
process from great scientist,

171
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,090
uh, living today to great
inventors, uh, to artists.

172
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,070
And I show that all of them follow
a very similar, uh, process.

173
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,150
Uh, they may, uh, all do
really well economically.

174
00:11:30,151 --> 00:11:33,240
They made create a amazingly
successful companies,

175
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:38,370
or it amazingly successful
a music theater. Uh,

176
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:43,110
and yet, uh, what's driving
them is something else actually,

177
00:11:43,111 --> 00:11:48,090
and it's related to the reward,
uh, system, uh, of our brains.

178
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:51,330
And you are all probably aware of,
but just to remind you,

179
00:11:51,331 --> 00:11:54,200
there are three fundamental
processes, um, uh,

180
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,800
motivate us through the reward
system. One is a wanting process. Um,

181
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:02,710
one is a reinforcement learning
process and one is a liking process.

182
00:12:02,711 --> 00:12:07,711
And an illustration of this very
simply would be Anna Karenina.

183
00:12:08,351 --> 00:12:13,351
Let's say I'm a told to for my class or
for some other reason want to read a Leo

184
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:19,200
Tolstoy's Anna Karenina. There's some,
uh, pleasure actually and wanting, uh,

185
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:22,120
anything and particularly wanting
to read Anna Karenina. I read it.

186
00:12:22,121 --> 00:12:25,660
So there's this reinforcement
learning. I began to like, uh,

187
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,970
Anna Karenina and finally
having finished the book,

188
00:12:27,971 --> 00:12:31,810
I really like it so much that I talk
to my wife about Anna Karenina and we

189
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:36,490
exchange ideas. And when I go to read my
next book of Leo Tolstoy War and peace,

190
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:39,520
uh, I have been informed through
that conversation with my wife.

191
00:12:39,521 --> 00:12:44,470
And that kind of cycle of how we learn
is really the cycle of how we create.

192
00:12:44,471 --> 00:12:49,471
And so in Ferran Adria as case from the
ideating to the experimenting to the

193
00:12:49,661 --> 00:12:54,400
serving of a, an amazing dish, this cycle,

194
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:55,060
um,

195
00:12:55,060 --> 00:13:00,060
in all of the creator lives that
I describe a is fundamental,

196
00:13:00,281 --> 00:13:04,240
not only to learning the kinds of
dimensions that I mentioned, the empathy,

197
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,370
the passion and others that
I'll mention in just a minute,

198
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:10,510
but also creating value that
they bring to the public.

199
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:15,780
There's a conversation much like
what happens with the Internet and,

200
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:19,720
uh,
and everyone learns and then they go back.

201
00:13:19,721 --> 00:13:23,890
And not only is that a formative
for the creative thing,

202
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,860
this new thing that the
world has never seen before,

203
00:13:26,861 --> 00:13:29,860
which goes through this cycle of
communication with the public,

204
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:34,630
but it's actually deeply pleasurable.
So in my book,

205
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:38,710
I highlight these emotive
and cognitive dimensions,

206
00:13:38,711 --> 00:13:43,711
which are pretty contrasted to the emotive
and cognitive dimensions that we tend

207
00:13:44,051 --> 00:13:47,380
to celebrate and culture
and, and maybe, um,

208
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,070
inculcate in our businesses
and our business schools.

209
00:13:51,071 --> 00:13:53,860
And so it's clear that in,
uh,

210
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:58,600
the success of a Google or the
success of a, even my book,

211
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:02,020
uh,
both sets of qualities are important.

212
00:14:02,021 --> 00:14:04,900
There are times where we're at battle.
Uh,

213
00:14:04,901 --> 00:14:09,901
and there are times where
we are discovering and the
qualities that lead to the

214
00:14:10,481 --> 00:14:15,481
successful warrior are pretty defiantly
not the qualities that lead to the

215
00:14:15,701 --> 00:14:20,260
successful pioneer. And one of the
challenges in writing a book or,

216
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:24,580
um, uh, bringing great value to, uh,

217
00:14:24,581 --> 00:14:28,660
to the world in a company like Google
is how do you balance these two?

218
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,660
In my book, I am focusing mostly
on this patch of blue and,

219
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:37,140
and a and read, uh, and this, the,

220
00:14:37,141 --> 00:14:41,440
the cycle of creating that allows for
these qualities to be learned and we

221
00:14:41,441 --> 00:14:44,860
learned and, and ultimately
shared. Now, if I ask you, uh,

222
00:14:44,861 --> 00:14:47,740
what are the qualities and the neighbors
you'd like to live with? I can imagine,

223
00:14:47,741 --> 00:14:52,250
which, I'm sorry. I hope I can imagine
which a set of qualities they are.

224
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:57,050
And one of the points in my book
is while we are interested today,

225
00:14:57,051 --> 00:15:00,470
obviously in creating things that mattered
to many over a very long period of

226
00:15:00,471 --> 00:15:05,120
time, this future that we're
all looking for is really, uh,

227
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,980
starts today, right? And it's,

228
00:15:06,981 --> 00:15:11,360
and it's as much as it relates to this
thing that you're mattering, it makes,

229
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,310
it relates even more fundamentally
to how you ate this thing, right?

230
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:20,540
And so this a way of living,
uh,

231
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:25,340
uh, passionate curiosity, empathy
and tuition in a sense of humility,

232
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:30,190
all of which I described more
fundamentally in the book is, is, uh,

233
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,920
is critical, I believe, to
introduce into our schools,

234
00:15:33,921 --> 00:15:38,630
into our companies and into interculture.
And indeed in my book,

235
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:40,910
uh,
I talk about how that's happening.

236
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:44,810
So the last part of my book,
uh,

237
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:47,090
emphasizes the grassroots
Creator Movement,

238
00:15:47,091 --> 00:15:50,580
which I identify as beginning around
the time of the first tweet, uh,

239
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,350
the first maker Faire make magazine,
uh,

240
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:59,250
over the last 10, 15 years as
you've thrived here at Google, uh,

241
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,520
the world has radically changed,
as we all know.

242
00:16:01,521 --> 00:16:05,720
But one of the things that's most striking
to me is that over a short period of

243
00:16:05,721 --> 00:16:06,290
time,

244
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:11,270
much of the planet has now placed itself
in a position of creatively expressing

245
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:13,430
itself in a way that
never happened before.

246
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,590
And expressing itself in ways that endure.

247
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:21,670
Much of this creation may be viewed by
many as trivial or not interesting or

248
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:26,410
even, um, profoundly irritating. Uh,

249
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,190
but it is fundamentally and in
many cases not to make money,

250
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,020
not to make a name,
although that happens,

251
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:38,290
but to express oneself and express
an experience that one has had,

252
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:44,800
that aesthetic creation
is I think fundamental to
creating the world that we all

253
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:49,430
wish to live in. And indeed, it's
starting to re, uh, structure how we,

254
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,390
uh, how we, how we run companies. Uh,

255
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,070
the kinds of environments that
companies are thriving in.

256
00:16:55,071 --> 00:16:58,490
And it's quite reflected by
your own, uh, your own campus.

257
00:16:58,491 --> 00:17:01,400
And so I've been very involved.
I've opened a restaurant in, in,

258
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:04,130
in Cambridge and have my
students making things.

259
00:17:04,131 --> 00:17:07,250
And so I'm really interested in
this grassroots create a movement.

260
00:17:07,251 --> 00:17:11,000
And one of the things that fascinates
me and I talk about in the book is that

261
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:15,770
we're seeing this self
association that creators, um,

262
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,500
grassroots creators, um, make and uh,

263
00:17:19,501 --> 00:17:22,970
these happen online obviously,
but they also happen in a,

264
00:17:22,971 --> 00:17:25,220
in physical environments.

265
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:29,120
And these could be habitat for humanity
kinds of gatherings where they could be

266
00:17:29,121 --> 00:17:33,110
weekend food, making a gatherings.
These could happen in classes,

267
00:17:33,111 --> 00:17:34,220
lots of maker activities.

268
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:39,221
But these are often self associations
of creators who want to create together,

269
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,560
maybe write fiction together.

270
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:47,920
And they come together really very
frequently for the pleasure of creating

271
00:17:48,381 --> 00:17:49,214
together.

272
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:54,050
And they learn as I write in the
book these same qualities, uh,

273
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:57,100
these aesthetic dimensions
of creating that are, um,

274
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:01,980
not only fundamental to creating a over
a very long period of time but having

275
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:05,340
fun and,
and a personal self satisfaction.

276
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:10,700
So I'm going to end really
quickly here by talking about a,

277
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:15,060
uh, to, uh, innovation,

278
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,373
um,

279
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,090
activities that I've been very engaged
with over these 15 years as I've been

280
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,900
learning myself and
creating environments that

281
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:29,880
foster this kind of learning.
And, uh, one of these, um,

282
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:33,310
relates to my work in Africa
in the early two thousands.

283
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,850
I was one of the first grand challenge,
um,

284
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,560
gates grand challenge grantees and
was focused on a inhaled vaccines and

285
00:18:40,561 --> 00:18:43,960
antibiotics for a tuberculosis set up,
a not for profit and South African.

286
00:18:43,961 --> 00:18:46,640
I became struck by the
middle two thousands.

287
00:18:46,641 --> 00:18:50,010
There was relative affluence coming to
Africa by these mounds of trash that

288
00:18:50,011 --> 00:18:53,760
we're growing outside of the cities and
this sort of importation of diseases

289
00:18:53,761 --> 00:18:54,780
that we thought.
Until then,

290
00:18:54,781 --> 00:18:59,730
we're fundamentally developed world
diseases like cardiac and depression and

291
00:18:59,731 --> 00:19:04,410
other kinds of illnesses. And shifted
my work for many other reasons,

292
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:08,550
to food and to, uh,
to, uh, ultimately, uh,

293
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:13,380
for a significant amount of my
creative time to food packaging.

294
00:19:13,381 --> 00:19:14,970
And I came up with this idea that well,

295
00:19:14,971 --> 00:19:19,500
we really should make a packaging like
nature makes packaging and the ultimate

296
00:19:19,501 --> 00:19:21,900
water bottle is the coconut and a,

297
00:19:21,901 --> 00:19:24,300
and so I began to reflect
on how that would be done.

298
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:29,510
Now this was for many years a curated
in a cultural context where we did an

299
00:19:31,231 --> 00:19:33,210
exhibition in Paris at the level of 12,

300
00:19:33,211 --> 00:19:35,790
this cultural center
that I opened in 2007.

301
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:40,860
And a invited the public to,
uh, eat water bottles. And,

302
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:45,830
uh, for, uh, two or three years.
This, uh, kind of Wiki food, uh,

303
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:50,870
was a cultural experiment and we
set up an underground restaurant in,

304
00:19:52,151 --> 00:19:53,670
in Paris and a,

305
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:58,400
this led to accompany a eventually
and to products, um, uh, that, uh,

306
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:02,430
sell particular on the east coast and
ultimately to this product of which I have

307
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:05,660
some here, which you can now
make any fruit in the form, uh,

308
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:08,670
or any food really in the form of grapes,
uh,

309
00:20:08,671 --> 00:20:12,720
and a and the product that is now launched
and that you can taste or a fruit,

310
00:20:12,721 --> 00:20:16,680
kids are not eating fruit anymore because
the trend is going down because fruit,

311
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:20,940
um, you sort of complicated to, uh, eat
and parents are concerned about skins,

312
00:20:20,941 --> 00:20:25,650
but you can remake fruit, uh, with
these edible, um, packages if you will,

313
00:20:25,651 --> 00:20:29,220
or skins. Uh, and this
work now through, um,

314
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:34,470
uh, a number of collaborators
is, is moving to, uh,

315
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,760
a, uh, an effort in Africa,
particularly in Sierra Leone, uh,

316
00:20:38,761 --> 00:20:42,810
to develop a local food forums,
uh, that are environmentally

317
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:49,180
sustainable and that are highly,
uh,

318
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:53,110
in fact, derived by, by micro nutrients.

319
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:58,060
So what began as an idea in Africa moved
through a cultural environment for a

320
00:20:58,061 --> 00:21:02,650
time that might've been an in determinant,
certainly was, uh, in the process,

321
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:04,990
became a company,
a venture backed company,

322
00:21:04,991 --> 00:21:08,380
and is now coming back to Africa all
through a process that kind of needed to

323
00:21:08,381 --> 00:21:12,860
have this open ended, uh, and um, uh,

324
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:16,390
driving force that was other
than pure commercial interests.

325
00:21:16,391 --> 00:21:19,870
Now just finish by saying that I've
also been interested in since my first

326
00:21:19,871 --> 00:21:22,420
company, uh, related to
inhaled insulin and, uh,

327
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:27,370
delivering health and wellness to the
air and have become fascinated since the

328
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:32,020
Nobel prize in 2004 with
the revolution happening in,

329
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:35,320
uh, in, in mill factory biology. Uh,

330
00:21:35,321 --> 00:21:39,700
the largest sub class of the human
genome is the olfactory receptor subclass

331
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:42,640
olfactory receptors and not just in
your nose there throughout your body.

332
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,350
And so this is amazing conversation that's
going on since soreally inside of you

333
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:52,350
that we understand now is fundamentally
related to olfaction and clearly, uh,

334
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:57,100
plays a major role in metabolic health
and neurologic health and getting that

335
00:21:57,101 --> 00:22:01,900
right. Um, uh, we believe
is partly related to,

336
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,790
um, uh, writing.

337
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:07,930
Some of the metabolic and neurologic
dysfunction that's happened here over the

338
00:22:07,931 --> 00:22:09,370
last 30 or 40 years.

339
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:14,371
And so we've developed a platform for
digitizing scent and began to work and

340
00:22:14,951 --> 00:22:19,090
collaborate with Questlove and thinking
about synesthesia and, and, uh,

341
00:22:19,091 --> 00:22:23,440
how these kinds of, um,
experiences can, uh,

342
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:28,490
improve, uh, wellbeing and, and, uh,
experience with, um, even of, uh,

343
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:31,900
music, uh, and ultimately
come into work environments,

344
00:22:31,901 --> 00:22:36,570
looking how sensory design can improve
the workspace. And finally, um,

345
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:40,720
we're coming out with
our first real, um, uh,

346
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:44,260
mass market product here this year,
uh, which I can share with you,

347
00:22:44,261 --> 00:22:48,670
which is a way of, uh,
creating flavor images, um,

348
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:53,320
either autonomously or over any food
you can kind of color any food with a

349
00:22:53,321 --> 00:22:58,321
flavor of chocolate or
popcorn or a or rum.

350
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:02,380
And, uh, and then in consuming that
food, your brain tells you that.

351
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,430
That's just what I've had.

352
00:23:03,431 --> 00:23:07,690
And so it's a really interesting way
to address some of the food addiction

353
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:11,370
issues that we're dealing with
today. So once again, this, uh,

354
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,960
project began it blue sky actually
with some of my students, uh,

355
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,670
developed in a cultural environment for
a long period of time and finally, uh,

356
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:23,740
through commercial forces is
moving into the marketplace.

357
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:29,160
So I'd like to just end by saying that
these sorts of culture lab environments

358
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:34,090
that began to show up in Europe and
the middle two thousands are now

359
00:23:34,091 --> 00:23:37,960
increasingly I'm showing
up in companies like yours.

360
00:23:37,961 --> 00:23:42,370
I view what I know of Google and
uh, in part does a culture lab. Uh,

361
00:23:42,371 --> 00:23:46,370
we moved the level of cultural
lab to Cambridge in 2014

362
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:50,900
and began the world frontiers forum and
the World Frontiers Forum as a gathering

363
00:23:50,901 --> 00:23:52,580
of leaders from around the world.

364
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:57,350
We bring them to experience 15 frontiers
of tomorrow from contemporary art to

365
00:23:57,351 --> 00:24:01,040
biology, significant collaboration
with the United Nations.

366
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:05,810
And we try to hatch every year a
project that can scale rapidly and the

367
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:10,310
developing world and address one or
more of the sustainable development

368
00:24:10,311 --> 00:24:10,821
challenges.

369
00:24:10,821 --> 00:24:15,530
And so this gets back to this notion
of how do you capture the energy of the

370
00:24:15,531 --> 00:24:17,540
grassroots creative movement and,

371
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:22,780
and help guide it towards sustainability
of the human condition in the long

372
00:24:23,031 --> 00:24:27,170
time. That has always been
our biological self interest.

373
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,760
Thank you very much.

374
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:34,210
[inaudible]

375
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,950
and not sure how we do
questions and answers,

376
00:24:36,951 --> 00:24:39,830
but I'd really love to talk with you.

377
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:42,010
I'm curious what your thoughts are.

378
00:24:42,011 --> 00:24:46,480
If you've looked at this difference in
the creative space between people who are

379
00:24:46,481 --> 00:24:49,660
kind of like the visionaries
and how this idea like, oh,

380
00:24:49,661 --> 00:24:50,980
this product would be really cool.

381
00:24:50,981 --> 00:24:54,730
And then they assemble a team of people
to get that done versus the creatives

382
00:24:54,731 --> 00:24:59,050
who are more on the side of
like the actual people who
are building the products

383
00:24:59,051 --> 00:25:02,590
and creating the technologies and kind
of like what the different qualities of

384
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,480
people on those different
sides of the equation.

385
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:10,040
Yeah, absolutely. And you know, if you,

386
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:12,590
I find always helpful too.

387
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:17,620
So the question for those of you who
didn't hear that clearly is how do you

388
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,320
combine the visionary with the,

389
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:27,920
the creatives who are bringing
vision to, um, to practice.

390
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,001
And a,

391
00:25:29,001 --> 00:25:32,630
I think implicitly you're suggesting
that as I kind of did that they're really

392
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:35,570
different qualities that lead
to success here in sexist here.

393
00:25:35,571 --> 00:25:38,090
And often those cultures
don't really mix very well.

394
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:42,530
And of course this has been
true throughout history and um,

395
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,030
and uh,
um,

396
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:48,320
I think today in the highly
specialized world that we live in,

397
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:53,090
uh, and the way we educate,
um, and organize ourselves,

398
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:56,620
the barriers between those two,
um,

399
00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:00,170
sort of cultures are greater.
Um,

400
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:04,140
I think that very successful,
uh,

401
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,280
cultural innovation
environments and I view

402
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:13,730
Silicon Valley would be an
example of such an environment.

403
00:26:13,731 --> 00:26:17,270
Boston maybe for biotech, New
York, maybe for Broadway theater,

404
00:26:17,271 --> 00:26:19,610
the tend to create

405
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,360
sub cultures.

406
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:26,900
And I think that generally
you have a learning culture.

407
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,150
We're visionaries often sort of thrive.

408
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:33,260
You have an experimental culture where
people can fail and get paid for it

409
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:34,243
actually.

410
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:38,780
And you have a environment where people
produce and that any of those are sort

411
00:26:38,781 --> 00:26:43,060
of relatively easy and you find them
in many, many places. It's very hard.

412
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:47,550
How hard would it create a culture where
ideas and people move between them and

413
00:26:47,551 --> 00:26:51,060
where there's a trust that
allows that to happen.

414
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:55,640
And that is the sort of Pixie dust of,
um,

415
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,920
creating tomorrow. And again,
it's something that I talk
more about in the book.

416
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:03,740
I think that to be a little
bit more concrete, uh,

417
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:08,840
partly because of the nature of the
world that we are living in today. Um,

418
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,280
and, and, and, and, and, and frankly, uh,

419
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:16,980
the risky nature of the world we're
living in today probably has a lot more to

420
00:27:16,981 --> 00:27:19,530
do with our evolutionary conditions.

421
00:27:19,531 --> 00:27:23,720
Then the world of big offices
and kind of shore paychecks.

422
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:29,160
Um,
we can sort of,

423
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:30,953
uh,

424
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,833
okay,

425
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:39,230
thrive less well with the luxury of
considering myself a pure visionary or

426
00:27:39,631 --> 00:27:44,150
considering myself a pure,
yeah. Applied kind of, um, uh,

427
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:48,590
a creator and we're
needing, um, all of us to,

428
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:49,903
uh,

429
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:55,860
tolerate and thrive in the
conditions of pioneering, um, uh,

430
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:58,730
vision, uh, as well as, uh,

431
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:05,050
being engaged in the complexity of sharing
that vision with others and learning

432
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:07,963
from others.

433
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:13,970
So the ivory tower is, is under, um,

434
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,590
I don't know if it ever really existed,

435
00:28:15,591 --> 00:28:19,330
but it's very hard to
rationalize today and, uh, and,

436
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:23,860
and I think honestly it's very hard
to be a visionary and not be, um,

437
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:29,040
engaged in what you're describing as
that creative sort of exchange with the

438
00:28:29,261 --> 00:28:30,730
public.
It used to be,

439
00:28:30,731 --> 00:28:35,290
we understood better what people
needed and I think increasingly we need

440
00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:36,970
everyone to show,
to tell us that.

441
00:28:36,971 --> 00:28:41,560
So I'm hopeful that those two
cultures are coming together and a,

442
00:28:41,561 --> 00:28:45,660
and in any case, I think environments
need to do a lot to just help, uh,

443
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:48,070
both sides. Um, communicate.

444
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,570
Hi. Um, so I agree with you there.

445
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:57,850
There's a lot of exciting
empowerment and personal creativity,

446
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:02,470
but at the same time I see
increasing trends toward, um,

447
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:05,860
short term rewarding short term gains,
um,

448
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,680
shorter and shorter products
like product life cycles,

449
00:29:08,681 --> 00:29:12,280
which is where we get these piles of
trash and, and so, and so how does,

450
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:14,080
how do we start to shift?
Yup.

451
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:14,920
Okay.

452
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,710
Towards our culture valuing
longer term contributions. Yeah.

453
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:21,920
That seems like a real challenge
to this. Yeah, no, absolutely.

454
00:29:21,921 --> 00:29:25,130
And as was true in the
Italian renaissance,

455
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:30,020
any sort of renaissance period, um, on
the one hand we like to talk about, um,

456
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,350
the heroes of the renaissance. But it was
a very tough time to be living things.

457
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,060
Everything was got to,

458
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:40,060
gave vague and all of the institutions
were pointing us in the wrong direction.

459
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:45,260
And that's even more profoundly true
today. And so it's hard to look at, um,

460
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:51,030
anything almost in the
media, uh, and uh, uh, if,

461
00:29:51,031 --> 00:29:54,640
if nowhere else, and not
realize that, uh, the,

462
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:57,900
the qualities that I'm highlighting,
um,

463
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:00,460
and that I believe are really critical
to creating a world we all want to live

464
00:30:00,461 --> 00:30:02,440
in, are not, um,

465
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:06,310
very frequently the qualities that are
being propagated in our institutions.

466
00:30:06,311 --> 00:30:11,311
I think one of the things that I'm saying
for sure is that those qualities of

467
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:14,920
short termism are not sustainable.
Right?

468
00:30:14,921 --> 00:30:19,840
And so I'm personally less interested in
spending my energy and figuring out how

469
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:22,210
do I kind of wake people up to,
and just,

470
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:25,750
there are a lot of people
who are awakened and,

471
00:30:25,751 --> 00:30:30,320
and I think that in the
spirit of the pioneer, um,

472
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:34,840
I prefer to be with those pioneers making
tomorrow. And just assuming that the,

473
00:30:34,841 --> 00:30:37,810
uh, those who, you know, the, the
unsustainable activity here, we'll,

474
00:30:37,811 --> 00:30:38,920
we'll stop at some point.

475
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,620
I had a similar question to gold on,
on his,

476
00:30:42,621 --> 00:30:46,120
about a short term thinking long
term thinking. We have a lot of, uh,

477
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,130
many institutions including
the government in the u s ray,

478
00:30:49,131 --> 00:30:53,030
you elect officials every four years.
Companies like Google,

479
00:30:53,031 --> 00:30:57,080
you have a annual quarterly performance
reviews and things like that.

480
00:30:57,081 --> 00:31:00,740
You have to show some
progress towards a goal. Uh,

481
00:31:00,741 --> 00:31:05,720
how do you bridge that gap between
sort of needing to show some short term

482
00:31:05,721 --> 00:31:06,171
progress,

483
00:31:06,171 --> 00:31:11,171
short term goals in the long term
kind of solving longterm problems?

484
00:31:11,781 --> 00:31:16,580
Like asteroids hitting hurts.
Yeah, 20 years from now, 50 years.

485
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:21,560
So the great question, and I, um,

486
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:24,900
as I also write about in the book,
um,

487
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:29,450
and maybe did not emphasize
enough here, I am not, um,

488
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:33,560
I don't believe personally that the
value that a Harvard University brings to

489
00:31:33,561 --> 00:31:35,150
the world or a Google brings to the world,

490
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:40,420
both institutions being under extreme
pressure to deliver value today.

491
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:46,190
Um, and, uh, this semester or
this quarter, uh, and both,

492
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:49,810
however, being highly invested in, um,

493
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:51,720
yeah,

494
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,590
the future of 30 years from
now. Uh, so there's, uh, uh,

495
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:59,100
the big question, which is
what you've just asked, well,

496
00:31:59,101 --> 00:32:03,450
how do you balance the fact that we do
have students showing up the semester?

497
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,520
They really do need to take a class.

498
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:09,300
And maybe it's true that we
need to rethink education
completely, but meanwhile,

499
00:32:09,301 --> 00:32:10,021
you've got students,

500
00:32:10,021 --> 00:32:12,180
you've got to teach today and you can't
tell them what we're figure if you get

501
00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:15,180
out. Right. And so that's
Kinda the issue. Um,

502
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:20,490
so I think what defacto is happening,
uh,

503
00:32:20,491 --> 00:32:24,990
and it explains my role at
Harvard University. Um, and,

504
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:29,610
and, uh, I think, um, from my
understanding of Google and, and,

505
00:32:29,611 --> 00:32:34,090
and a lot of the, uh, sort
of California tech, um, uh,

506
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,000
technology scene,

507
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:41,900
sort of enlightened leadership that is
giving space to whether it's giving all

508
00:32:41,901 --> 00:32:46,830
of you time to think out of
the box or letting you, um,

509
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:51,650
sort of create a company
and move off campus and,

510
00:32:51,651 --> 00:32:56,000
and sort of creating these sort of
experimental sandboxes where, uh,

511
00:32:56,210 --> 00:33:00,650
we can dream about the future. Um,
and that itself is relatively simple.

512
00:33:00,651 --> 00:33:03,410
What's difficult actually is
how to create that sandbox.

513
00:33:03,411 --> 00:33:06,830
We're not only do you go off
and sort of think long term,

514
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:09,590
but what you do matters to me back here.

515
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:13,190
So that's the bigger issue is how do I
stay in touch and not lose sight of you?

516
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:16,520
Wow. How do I keep carrying? And that is
really an enlightened leadership issue.

517
00:33:16,521 --> 00:33:21,380
And I, I think getting back to this
point that I tried to make earlier, um,

518
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:26,560
the good thing about where we're at right
now is that it's so urgent that we pay

519
00:33:28,701 --> 00:33:33,701
attention to the longer term future that
we kind of just can't afford to send

520
00:33:34,401 --> 00:33:37,460
you off to think about the
future and then forget about you.

521
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:40,490
And so I think that there's
clearly an awakening,

522
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:45,080
a happening today that I am hopeful,
um, will lead to more of that.

523
00:33:45,081 --> 00:33:48,710
But it is a complicated a balance,
um,

524
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:51,530
that I think all of us in
a way strike in our lives.

525
00:33:51,531 --> 00:33:54,470
And if you think back childhood,
I have kids now 15,

526
00:33:54,471 --> 00:33:59,410
17 and 19 and there I've learned so
much from them and I still do. Um, uh,

527
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:04,720
but if you think back on the qualities
that made you survive adolescence,

528
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:12,560
um, where you needed at the
same time to be profound,

529
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,780
the moment at local and at the
same time yet to think about,

530
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:19,280
I'm going to call us and I got to go.
And you had to kind to think,

531
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:21,860
and you were in this sort of,
that's,

532
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,650
that's really what life is about.
Right.

533
00:34:24,651 --> 00:34:28,570
And I think that there's been too much
now for too long where we kind of assumed

534
00:34:28,571 --> 00:34:32,390
that we'll that ended and then you kind
of, and then this w it's, it's, it's,

535
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,520
we need to balance all those things.
For sure.

536
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:38,750
I just want you to hear your
thoughts on AI in creativity.

537
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:43,490
I think with artificial intelligence
today we tend to kind of see more and more

538
00:34:43,491 --> 00:34:47,060
of things that we are already thinking
and people that other people were

539
00:34:47,061 --> 00:34:47,660
thinking.

540
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:52,660
But how you go outside the box
and how you see AI playing a role.

541
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:53,843
Belinda?
Yeah.

542
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:58,460
Well, again, the question of it, this
is another big, big question. And,

543
00:34:58,461 --> 00:35:03,390
and uh, I think my innocence will
help simplify the answer. Um,

544
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,753
so

545
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:10,490
let me just first say that one of the
things I write about in the book and that

546
00:35:10,491 --> 00:35:14,780
I, I, I'm experienced every semester with
my students is this first day where I'm,

547
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:19,070
uh, you know, presenting
the concept of the class.

548
00:35:19,071 --> 00:35:22,790
You've got to create something that
matters. And, and, and I in one year,

549
00:35:22,791 --> 00:35:26,180
and I write about this in the book as
student asks this question and this gets

550
00:35:26,181 --> 00:35:30,350
asked every year in one form or another,
what if I don't have an idea? You know,

551
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:31,603
and uh,

552
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:35,850
that the compliment to that is the
student who says d and then the next day,

553
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:39,060
but I found it online. Everybody
knows this is like out there already.

554
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:42,980
And my point to both of those,
uh,

555
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:46,710
young people is, is the same that, um,

556
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:50,340
if you were getting to
artificial intelligence,

557
00:35:50,341 --> 00:35:55,341
I just want to finish this little thought
that I think what makes you matter,

558
00:35:56,750 --> 00:36:01,500
uh,
no more than me in a certain way,

559
00:36:01,501 --> 00:36:05,430
is that you own your
experience and I don't.

560
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:09,660
And that experience tells
you something about now, uh,

561
00:36:09,661 --> 00:36:12,630
and about the needs and opportunities
now that only, you know,

562
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:15,570
and if from that you observe,

563
00:36:15,571 --> 00:36:19,260
you're mindful enough to kind of
just notice and you have an idea,

564
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,280
I want that is coming from this intuition,

565
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:25,830
a lot of observations that you
could even articulate. And so, yeah,

566
00:36:25,831 --> 00:36:29,400
we all want to create a wheel.
And then he said, well my God,

567
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:32,160
people have created wheels for a
long time. But I will say to you,

568
00:36:32,161 --> 00:36:35,610
but forget about what people are great
and why the hell did you say wheel?

569
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:37,380
What is that mean for you?

570
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:41,670
And as you dig into it and you dig
into that Big Bank of knowledge,

571
00:36:41,671 --> 00:36:46,590
which is intuition, uh, you will
have created something unique.

572
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:51,870
The a wheel. So I say all of that to
say that I think two things about it,

573
00:36:51,871 --> 00:36:55,960
artificial intelligence from my
really distant perspective, one, um,

574
00:36:56,010 --> 00:37:00,500
the obvious thing that really what's
happening is the national and artificial s

575
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:02,550
kind of merging and we're all,
because it's kind of,

576
00:37:02,551 --> 00:37:05,220
we're going to be difficult to really
separate between the two and already is

577
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,220
right. The whole notion of consciousness
as being something that's biological,

578
00:37:08,221 --> 00:37:11,970
it's crazy. It's clearly distributed. And
so clearly there's this merger going on.

579
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:17,310
I'm not fairly, so a big
issue in that is, is learning,

580
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,580
learning to adapt to this
drafted that we don't all learn.

581
00:37:20,581 --> 00:37:25,020
So that's a huge issue. Um,
I think the second thing,

582
00:37:25,021 --> 00:37:28,680
and this gets to thriving and
humanity and the long term,

583
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:34,010
I think that my intuition is that what
is happening here with the advance of

584
00:37:34,471 --> 00:37:37,950
artificial intelligence is
what makes us human most human,

585
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:42,080
which is not probably the calculus
that I learned when we, well,

586
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:43,890
when I was like 20 years of age.

587
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:49,110
But it's actually that intuitive
bank of knowledge of my moment,

588
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,420
right? I own that. And I
own that in a way that, um,

589
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:58,320
no computer, however smart who
wasn't there can now. Right.

590
00:37:58,321 --> 00:38:02,760
And so being able to mine that, uh,
and you know, it's, as, you know,

591
00:38:02,761 --> 00:38:06,570
as we're advancing so rapidly towards
the future of artificial intelligence and

592
00:38:06,571 --> 00:38:07,260
present,

593
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:12,260
we're discovering that biology is like
a black hole in terms of the complexity

594
00:38:13,531 --> 00:38:17,730
and, and a sophistication
and a, you know, so I, my,

595
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,560
my guess is that there will be
a, a coexistence, uh, again,

596
00:38:22,561 --> 00:38:26,430
not without pain. Uh, and, and I think
there are a lot of issues, as I say,

597
00:38:26,431 --> 00:38:31,230
I'm related to equity and how we,
how we manage this. Okay. I'm,

598
00:38:31,231 --> 00:38:36,000
I'm trying to really hard to resist the
temptation to just Mander and ramble. Um,

599
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,020
I'm going to try to make this
as short as I possibly can,

600
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:42,790
but it sort of piggybacks off of Tom's
comment, and I don't know your name,

601
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:46,870
but the comment you had after, um,
and something you said about, uh,

602
00:38:46,871 --> 00:38:50,710
the Italian renaissance.
I recently read the,

603
00:38:50,711 --> 00:38:52,600
the new biography of Leonardo Da Vinci.

604
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:57,790
And one of the things that struck me was,
and this was according to the author,

605
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:02,850
like how often that he had a patron who
just gave him so much leeway and so much

606
00:39:04,721 --> 00:39:05,171
time,

607
00:39:05,171 --> 00:39:09,130
and then he spent the time just doing
whatever he wanted or moving on and not

608
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:13,560
procrastinating. And, um, you know, he,

609
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:17,260
he left angry patron after angry patron.
Um,

610
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:22,290
but that freedom that he
had to do whatever he want
led to two or three amazing

611
00:39:23,231 --> 00:39:26,500
masterpieces and a lot of sort of half,
you know,

612
00:39:26,501 --> 00:39:29,730
a lot of half finished
stuff, a lot of, um,

613
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:36,190
exploration and, uh, as, as, um,

614
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:40,270
the other two commenters alluded to now.

615
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:45,280
And as you said now, like we're so
goal oriented and so quarterly goal,

616
00:39:45,281 --> 00:39:50,281
yearly goal focused that I know you
said in response to both of those,

617
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:54,250
the policy is not like, I guess the focus
of what you're thinking on with this,

618
00:39:54,251 --> 00:39:58,900
but it does seem like a natural,
like next step to,

619
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:01,570
to seem like how can we unlock
more potential from people?

620
00:40:01,571 --> 00:40:03,910
There are a lot of creative people.
How do we unlock that?

621
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,300
I respond to that. Yes. Okay, cool. So
that's it. Now, you know, I, I read that,

622
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:14,380
in fact, I, I go more
into this in the book. Uh,

623
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,200
take Leonardo, um, as you say, the, the,
the Patriot and what I call activator was,

624
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:23,860
uh, played a big role. Patrons
look different today. It's true.

625
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:26,770
We have the Larry Pages
and we have the bill gates.

626
00:40:26,771 --> 00:40:31,770
But the radical change in patronage,
a few wells that's gone grassroots.

627
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:36,040
And so those are kind of, but, but
activators, um, are everywhere.

628
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:40,630
But the activators matter. Um,
and uh, the second thing is this,

629
00:40:40,631 --> 00:40:42,910
what I called culture lab in Florence.

630
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:46,540
He was super lucky to have been born in
Florence, but he was born in Florence,

631
00:40:46,541 --> 00:40:46,760
right?

632
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:51,760
So there's all this stuff going on and
experimentation was being invited and,

633
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:57,210
and there was a culture that could look
at the experiment of the Duomo and call

634
00:40:59,741 --> 00:41:01,300
it beautiful,
right?

635
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:05,980
And so there was this
ability to see the new, uh,

636
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:09,670
as, as, as potentially being very
beautiful. And so it invited.

637
00:41:09,671 --> 00:41:13,300
So there's a culture, uh, that mattered.

638
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:16,060
And finally,

639
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:21,330
Leonardo would be a real sort of model
of the kind of dimensions that I'm,

640
00:41:22,531 --> 00:41:25,900
I'm sort of referring to.
And so we do need this, um,

641
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:29,470
environment that,
uh,

642
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,620
includes people willing to bet on you.
Um,

643
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:35,680
and,

644
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:40,430
and to particularly bet on your ability
to realize the dream that matters to

645
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:42,040
more than you.
Uh,

646
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:46,730
we do need you to be surrounded
by those who can appreciate it.

647
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,470
Um, and, and, uh, and we, we,
we, we do fundamentally need,

648
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:55,670
um, you tried. So I
think that while again,

649
00:41:55,671 --> 00:41:58,130
getting back to the earlier point,
uh,

650
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:03,310
we are in and you are here at Google and
I am to the extent that I'm at Harvard

651
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:09,530
in environments where
you see a lot of the, uh,

652
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:13,370
kind of the success of the last 20,
30 and maybe more years,

653
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:18,880
kind of an an inertial wave that
we're part of that may be a little bit

654
00:42:20,301 --> 00:42:23,460
overwhelming, particularly we try to
move away from it sort of my role.

655
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:26,390
It just got to give good
care of Gulag. But, um,

656
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:31,790
that fortunately that is not the
whole of human experience right now.

657
00:42:31,791 --> 00:42:33,350
And I think that all I can say,

658
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:38,380
which is kind of how I
manage my relationship with
Harvard University for Super

659
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,910
Delighted and lucky that
Harvard is still, um, um,

660
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:44,470
calls me one of their faculty members.
Uh,

661
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,710
but I spent a lot of time away and I spend
a lot of time in my own space. And, uh,

662
00:42:48,711 --> 00:42:50,180
I think that,
um,

663
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:55,100
depending upon who you are and the
kind of pioneering you want to do, uh,

664
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:58,190
an enlightened, um, organization,

665
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:01,220
I'm sure Google should
give you that space. Now.

666
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:06,400
It's just important to understand that
Leonardo let a really risky life be any,

667
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:09,470
he was gonna not happy a lot of the time.
And he was kind of,

668
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,870
I didn't feel he was getting credit.
He had a lot of stuff.

669
00:43:11,871 --> 00:43:16,340
And so being out alone is, there's a lot
of these had realized that, you know,

670
00:43:16,341 --> 00:43:18,200
hanging by your fingernails is it,

671
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:21,470
it looks great when you then kind
of got to the top of Mount Everest,

672
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:25,750
but you're mostly hanging from his
fingernails and, and you've got to me,

673
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,110
I personally feel that that's, we
need to, I'll do more of that. Um, uh,

674
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:34,500
so, uh, that was a rambling
response to your rambling question.

675
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:38,030
Well, I have a very directed
short followup. Sorry.

676
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,820
What are some of the interventions,

677
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,570
I guess specifically you mentioned the
foundation that went to Cambridge and

678
00:43:44,571 --> 00:43:45,530
then, you know, I know in your,

679
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:49,550
I'm sure in your development of insulin
that you had opportunities or things

680
00:43:49,551 --> 00:43:53,900
that unlocked that ability for you. Yup.
Um, and so I was just wondering like,

681
00:43:53,901 --> 00:43:55,790
without getting too much
into the weeds of policy,

682
00:43:55,791 --> 00:43:58,910
like what are specific things you've seen
besides what you've already mentioned

683
00:43:58,911 --> 00:44:00,570
that, that have worked for, you know,

684
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:03,860
people who maybe otherwise would
not have had the opportunity?

685
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,020
Um, well, let me say that

686
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:14,590
in, um, in, in,

687
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:19,530
in my case, um, and I get,
I write quite, you know,

688
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:23,140
I write about it in the book. Can I also
point this out and other creator lives?

689
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:24,603
Um,

690
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:30,580
I have found that in pursuing,

691
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:35,760
um, my dreams to the extent that my
dreams mattered more than just to me,

692
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:36,721
uh,

693
00:44:36,721 --> 00:44:41,721
I have very frequently come to the edge
where this could be the it and I always

694
00:44:43,501 --> 00:44:46,910
found, uh, someone, uh,

695
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:50,820
who came and helped.
And this notion of activator,

696
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:54,270
which obviously in the
Italian renaissance, there's
some really famous ones,

697
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:55,560
but they're everywhere right now.

698
00:44:55,860 --> 00:45:00,860
And one of the great joys
of my own creative life is
the discovery that I'm not

699
00:45:01,501 --> 00:45:06,330
alone, and that there's this kind
of network. Uh, and, and so that's,

700
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:09,810
and, and, and so in the
inhaled insulin case,

701
00:45:09,811 --> 00:45:13,430
I was a theoretical guide,
written a couple textbooks.

702
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,190
I had five people in the world had
read and published this article.

703
00:45:17,191 --> 00:45:19,680
And I had a series of people,
um,

704
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:23,070
if venture capitalists I mentioned who
was more than a venture capitalist who

705
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:26,010
played a really big role in my life,
but many, many, many, many people.

706
00:45:26,011 --> 00:45:30,150
So is there a recipe? Um,
I don't know. I mean, I,

707
00:45:30,151 --> 00:45:34,800
I have lived for many years in Paris and
have had lots of conversations with, um,

708
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:37,860
the French government
and academia in France.

709
00:45:37,861 --> 00:45:42,030
But how do we create like Harvard in,
in, you know, pair? Is it an endowment?

710
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:45,420
Is that what we need? You
know? And so my big point,

711
00:45:45,421 --> 00:45:50,220
and maybe this is the most concrete
thing I can say, there are,

712
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:54,580
there's an amazing education in, in
France and in many ways and, and, uh,

713
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:58,320
really just such bright people
and such a rich culture.

714
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:02,940
But one thing that is,
um, that's not thrive, uh,

715
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:07,350
they're speaking really generally
is as a student. Uh, when I, uh,

716
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:09,810
leave a university,
there's,

717
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:14,760
there's not a possibility to take a
big risk. And, and, and, and, and, and,

718
00:46:14,761 --> 00:46:19,430
and do really, really well. I'm really
quickly, I mean it's more of a, uh,

719
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:23,760
a climb the ladder kind of phenomenon.
And I think that the,

720
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:28,970
um, the, the creating
of opportunities, um,

721
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:33,630
for the dreamers is, is the, the most
important thing that we can possibly do.

722
00:46:33,631 --> 00:46:34,440
And I think it's,

723
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:38,640
it is a challenge for a big successful
organizations to create those because

724
00:46:38,641 --> 00:46:43,470
it's hard to measure the value of the
little experiment in the context of the

725
00:46:43,471 --> 00:46:48,320
big, big mission. Uh,
but, but that betting,

726
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:52,470
and maybe I'll, I'll finish by
just saying that in a, I was just,

727
00:46:52,471 --> 00:46:56,220
just in Atlanta speaking to some people
and, and, and the question was, well,

728
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:59,990
what can we most do to like
do our kids, you know, and to,

729
00:46:59,991 --> 00:47:03,120
to help them create a world
that they want to live in.

730
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:07,480
And I'm kind of create what matters in
my point to them against the point I made

731
00:47:07,481 --> 00:47:10,980
in the book is that the best thing
we can do, I think to our kids is,

732
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:13,380
is help them see that they matter,
right?

733
00:47:13,381 --> 00:47:17,520
And so I think that you can't create a,
anything that matters if,

734
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:22,140
if you don't feel you matter
first. And so that, uh,

735
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:26,880
mattering for me has generally been
people from my dad to lots of people,

736
00:47:26,881 --> 00:47:29,740
my wife, lots of people who've
kind of bet on me in a certain way.

737
00:47:29,741 --> 00:47:32,860
And so you matter. And so
that's, that's the, uh,

738
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:38,080
maybe the easy answer. What
does it mean to matter? Uh,

739
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:41,800
what does it mean to matter? Well,
as I say a, it's a little bit,

740
00:47:41,801 --> 00:47:46,180
and I say more in the book, almost
anything matters at some moment, right?

741
00:47:46,181 --> 00:47:49,060
Every drop matters at some moment,
right? And so that everything matters.

742
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:53,110
So it's a provocation.
But what it means in the title of my book,

743
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:55,270
these are things that matter,
not just to you,

744
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,970
but to many and for a long period of time.

745
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:02,650
And so a way to translate that a little
bit before even that if you dig into,

746
00:48:02,651 --> 00:48:07,450
it's kind of, but they matter so
much that people want them to endure,

747
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:09,840
right?
And so they will help them endure.

748
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:12,370
It's like what you want of your
kid when your kid leaves home,

749
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,660
you want the kid to thrive,
right? You want every,

750
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:19,090
and that's not just your girl being,
you know, really entrepreneurial,

751
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:23,140
but people wanting her, you know, some
people wanting her in the room, people.

752
00:48:23,141 --> 00:48:24,630
And so,
uh,

753
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:28,870
creating something that
matters is creating something
that's alive and that sort

754
00:48:28,871 --> 00:48:30,100
of has a right to live.
