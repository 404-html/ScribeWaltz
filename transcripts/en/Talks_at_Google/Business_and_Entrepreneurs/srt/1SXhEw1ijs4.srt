1
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,170
Good afternoon everybody.

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:12,400
So thank you very much for coming to
this session today where we have the

3
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:16,740
pleasure of having Tomas Sharon to give
us a presentation on the death of the

4
00:00:16,741 --> 00:00:21,450
research reports. So, um, but
uh, as we get started, uh, peace,

5
00:00:21,451 --> 00:00:25,350
remember to turn off your cell
phones and all buzzing devices.

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,090
Um, so for many of you guys here
who already know Tomer, well,

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,170
welcome back to Google. For those of
you guys who don't know Tomer well,

8
00:00:34,171 --> 00:00:37,800
he used to be a senior user
experience researcher here at Google.

9
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,670
I'm looking on the fourth floor of this
building. That's when I got to know him.

10
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:46,650
Um, so toma today is a thought leader and
a few of our user experience design and

11
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:47,850
research,
uh,

12
00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:52,851
working as a vice president
and head forward hit off
user experience as we work,

13
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:58,350
which is this, a startup that has
thousands of locations worldwide, uh,

14
00:00:58,351 --> 00:01:02,400
in which, uh, Tomer leads this team
that designs work and living spaces,

15
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,810
communities and services around
the world as we work. So, uh,

16
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,880
there's also a desk at a back of the
room where are copies of the most recent

17
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:16,590
book written by Tomo is on sale.
So he's the author of two books,

18
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,060
validating products, ideas, true
lean user research that is on sale.

19
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,020
Uh, also the author of a less
reasons book, uh, is our research,

20
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:27,420
which I've read and enjoyed a lot.
Uh,

21
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:31,770
and both books have a socon actually
helped to increase the adoption of user

22
00:01:31,771 --> 00:01:35,460
experience research among
product teams were white.

23
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,560
Um, yeah, so, uh, this is how we're
going to do a two day session.

24
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,970
So first we would have [inaudible] up
here giving a presentation for about 20

25
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:49,020
minutes and then we would
transition to a file chats,

26
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:53,520
a discussion format between me and him.
I have some prepared questions for him,

27
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,790
I hope will be the same questions that
you guys have for his presentation.

28
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,470
And then after that we would open up a
session to Q and a from the audience.

29
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,600
Is that okay? Okay, great. And then
memory gets to audience Q. And. A.

30
00:02:06,601 --> 00:02:10,980
I would just request that
everybody stepped up to the
mics on the both sides of

31
00:02:10,981 --> 00:02:11,580
the room.

32
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,450
So that's all the questions that you raise
can be heard by the rest of the room.

33
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:19,700
It can also be recorded. Uh, yeah. And uh,

34
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:24,000
and we'll leave enough time so that you
guys can check out copies of his books

35
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:28,680
at a desk later, which comes with
a Google subsidized price. Okay.

36
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:30,570
So with that, uh, well welcome Toma.

37
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,300
Thank you Matt. It's great to be back and
it's great to see some familiar faces.

38
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,600
So when I joined,

39
00:02:42,601 --> 00:02:46,320
we work about close to two
years ago I asked this question,

40
00:02:46,321 --> 00:02:51,150
how do you decide what to work on?
And the answer to the question,

41
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,780
the answer that I got is pretty
much on our walls and our,

42
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:59,100
and our people's t-shirt's
do what you love. Um,

43
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,130
what we're trying

44
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:05,130
to do right from the guests from the get
go as we work is try and come up with

45
00:03:05,261 --> 00:03:08,800
something that helps people
understand that passion.

46
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:14,370
Do what you love is not necessarily
the only way to decide what to work on.

47
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:19,630
So we added, we created this diagram
and we added human needs and ability.

48
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,480
So let me explain.
Passion is do what you love.

49
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,800
You think a product of
feature is really cool,

50
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,280
you're really passionate about
doing that. Uh, so you just do it.

51
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,580
That's how many companies
decide what to work on.

52
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,630
We also added ability.
Can you even do that,

53
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,830
that thing that you want to do and um,

54
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,600
and let's say that passion and ability,

55
00:03:43,601 --> 00:03:47,550
sometimes you see a lot of companies
decide based on the ability as well. Uh,

56
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:52,210
and then what we wanted to add that
was completely missing at we work was

57
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,070
considering human needs.

58
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:59,080
Do people actually need that
thing that you're thinking of?

59
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,420
And it has to be what you see here.

60
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:04,510
It has to be a combination of all three
because if it's only a combination

61
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:09,430
between passion and need, then it's
fantasy. You can't, it's a flying car.

62
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:10,390
You can't really,

63
00:04:10,391 --> 00:04:14,800
you can't really do it if
it's a combination between
need and ability that is

64
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:19,480
just work nine to five. There's no
passion there. And, uh, forgive me,

65
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,231
art lovers,

66
00:04:20,231 --> 00:04:24,420
but if it's a combination between the
ability and passion than it's arth, uh,

67
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:28,300
it's not really needed, but it's
there. We're doing that anyway.

68
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,720
So this is, this is how, uh,

69
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,240
how we started a couple of
words about we work, uh,

70
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,890
we work as a company on a mission.

71
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,950
This is the company mission to create
a world where people work to make your

72
00:04:38,951 --> 00:04:43,150
life not just a living.
Um, these are current,

73
00:04:43,151 --> 00:04:45,320
we work cities.
Um,

74
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:51,060
I think we are in a 50 cities at the
moment with the over 160 locations and,

75
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,360
uh,
and we're growing,

76
00:04:55,361 --> 00:05:00,280
we're opening a about 10 between
10 and 20 buildings once,

77
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,210
um, once every month. Um, we worked,

78
00:05:04,211 --> 00:05:08,860
building we work is, is selling its
customers. We call them members, um,

79
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:12,580
space,
community and services.

80
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,090
So our spaces are known to be really,
really beautiful,

81
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:21,310
a really warm environment that
invites people to collaborate.

82
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:24,880
We have a lot of events that are going on,
uh,

83
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,760
throughout the day and
over a weekend sometimes.

84
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,180
And we also provide our
members with a lot of services,

85
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,740
a lot of digital products to support
meaningful connections between our members

86
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,600
and also, um, uh, apps
and so on and so forth.

87
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,580
Uh, to connect them services include
a health insurance if they want.

88
00:05:45,581 --> 00:05:49,870
And, and probably hundreds of
other, uh, different services.

89
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,480
This is my group's mission design,

90
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:56,440
delightful experiences for our members
through data informed human understanding.

91
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,900
And here's the challenge with we work. So
think about let's say, uh, I don't know,

92
00:06:02,901 --> 00:06:07,340
Steve Jobs. Um, he had
a relatively easy job.

93
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:11,540
If he wanted to understand the
user experience of apple products,

94
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,430
he could have said for most of them,

95
00:06:13,431 --> 00:06:16,070
bring me all of Apple's products
to the table in front of me.

96
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,480
I want to touch them. I want to feel
them. I want to give you feedback.

97
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,280
This guy, this is our cofounder
and CEO, Adam Newman. Uh,

98
00:06:25,281 --> 00:06:29,360
he can't do that because our
buildings are everywhere. Uh,

99
00:06:29,361 --> 00:06:33,020
we're opening in more and more far
away locations and it's really,

100
00:06:33,021 --> 00:06:36,200
really hard to understand
what is the user experience,

101
00:06:36,201 --> 00:06:38,270
what is our members experience?

102
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:44,150
So from here,
I jumped to the research that we do.

103
00:06:44,151 --> 00:06:48,650
And here are three problems
that we see with research,

104
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,580
uh, in companies, uh, happens here too,

105
00:06:52,581 --> 00:06:55,160
happens in probably every
company that does research.

106
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,550
So first is bad memory.

107
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,660
We have bad research memory.
Um,

108
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,780
let me know if this scenario sounds
familiar. Other researchers here,

109
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:09,200
I know there are some. So researchers,
you don't have to say yes,

110
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,400
but smile if it's true.
Um,

111
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:17,960
you want to do a research activity,
some kind of study and then you just,

112
00:07:17,961 --> 00:07:20,570
before you start planning,
you thinking to yourself, hmm,

113
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,990
maybe somebody else did it already.
So let me ask.

114
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:28,280
So you send an email to all of
the researchers in your group,

115
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,040
maybe in your product area,

116
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,810
may be all researchers at
Google. And then, uh, you ask,

117
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:39,980
did somebody do research about x?
Whatever it is that you're interested in.

118
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:44,900
And sure enough, by the end of
the day you get responses. Um,

119
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:49,190
I remember back in the day, it could go
up to 10 responses from people who say,

120
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:53,510
yes, we worked on something exactly
like that couple of years ago.

121
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,350
You don't get 10 responses for people
who completely forgot they did it maybe

122
00:07:57,351 --> 00:08:02,120
five years ago. And then,
um, you're a nice person.

123
00:08:02,121 --> 00:08:06,230
So you summarize everything you read,
you sent back to everybody.

124
00:08:06,231 --> 00:08:09,920
I see some smiles. So we know
it's true, it's still true. Um,

125
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:14,300
and then you decide to do this study
anyway because yours is a little bit

126
00:08:14,301 --> 00:08:16,610
different than you want to learn
something a little bit different.

127
00:08:16,611 --> 00:08:21,350
So you decide to do that anyway.
So we have bad research memories.

128
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:26,750
The second problem
is silos.

129
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,560
Researchers are not the only ones
who are doing research in a company.

130
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,940
Marketing is doing research.
Product managers,

131
00:08:34,941 --> 00:08:36,590
whether they call it research or not,

132
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:41,600
they are talking with a lot of users
all the time and so on and so forth.

133
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:46,100
If you have a, if you have a call
center, they don't do research,

134
00:08:46,101 --> 00:08:50,720
but sometimes they issue reports about
the top 10 problems that they're facing,

135
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,140
uh, that, that people are calling
them about. This is also a,

136
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,440
a silo where this data is saved.

137
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:03,420
So a lot of departments are doing
research. Everybody's happy to share,

138
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:08,130
but there's no one place to
make sense out of all of that.

139
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:10,470
Okay.

140
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,970
And my pet peeve reports,
um, I'm pretty sure,

141
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:18,270
although I, I, I remember some
exceptions here at goodwill.

142
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:23,060
I'm pretty sure that there's not one
person on the face of this earth that's

143
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,990
wakes up in the morning saying, I'm
going to read a report today. Um,

144
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:33,470
and being a researcher for many years,
I don't even like to write them. And uh,

145
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:38,510
I think reports are not what I called
the atomic unit of a research insight.

146
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,071
Again,

147
00:09:41,071 --> 00:09:46,071
researchers would tell you that you go
into a research study study and you have

148
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,330
a short list of questions you want to
answer. Those are the research questions.

149
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:56,480
And then research is life.
You look at life and life, uh,

150
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:00,700
looks at you back and say, I have
more answers. Then, uh, your question.

151
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:03,810
So you find out more than
what you intended to find.

152
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,820
And then there's the report. So you are,
as a researcher, you have a dilemma.

153
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:13,910
Should I report answers to the research
questions that we were interested in a

154
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:18,780
or should I report that? Plus a lot
of other information that I found.

155
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,060
Uh,
there's no rule about that.

156
00:10:21,061 --> 00:10:24,210
So any researcher does whatever
they think is right. Uh,

157
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:27,990
in any case reports on not really atomic,

158
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:33,050
there's a report that might include a
piece of information that has nothing to

159
00:10:33,151 --> 00:10:36,540
do with the reason for running this,
a specific research study.

160
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,980
And yet it's an important insight
that might serve people in the future,

161
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,080
but it's buried in the region.

162
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:43,963
Fourth,

163
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,390
so I'm, I'm aware of this, these
problems for many years. And, uh,

164
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,870
as soon as I joined we work and was
asked to start a group from scratch,

165
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,720
there was not a lot of research
going on there at the time. Um,

166
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,800
I thought this is an opportunity to
maybe solve all these problems with this

167
00:11:04,961 --> 00:11:07,900
system that we called Polaris.
So,

168
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:09,363
okay.

169
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,650
Polaris is a way for,
um,

170
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,610
I call it democratize the user experience.
Uh,

171
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,300
I published a medium post about
that and somebody responded saying,

172
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:25,290
you're not really democratizing, why do
you call it democratizing user expensive?

173
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:29,070
You just, it's just a
research archive. So, yes,

174
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:33,810
it is a research archive,
but uh, this, uh,

175
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,450
that research archive is the,
uh,

176
00:11:36,451 --> 00:11:39,960
the output democracy for user
experience is the outcome.

177
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,980
And that's really important.
What's happening with
Polaris is very interesting.

178
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,380
Um,
first of all,

179
00:11:46,381 --> 00:11:51,240
Polaris is a system that gathers
all of the research that, uh,

180
00:11:51,241 --> 00:11:55,750
that is being done at we work.
And it gathers that in a different,

181
00:11:55,751 --> 00:11:59,470
very different atomic unit than a report.
I'll get to that in a second.

182
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,770
In any case, Polaris is helping, um,

183
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,500
anyone that we work who
is designing anything,

184
00:12:05,501 --> 00:12:10,090
who's building anything was affecting
the member experience to prioritize their

185
00:12:10,091 --> 00:12:14,080
work. And I'll give you an
example for that very shortly, um,

186
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:18,460
to educate themselves. I know, um,

187
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:23,380
that teams at,
we work as teams here and again,

188
00:12:23,381 --> 00:12:27,160
researchers would, would know what I'm
talking about are not waiting for anyone.

189
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:32,220
They're not waiting for a researcher
or for report or for a study to end to

190
00:12:32,681 --> 00:12:35,110
decide what to do or to
decide what to work on.

191
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:40,300
That said they are happy to learn and
educate themselves about what they decided

192
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,134
to do already.

193
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:46,420
So Polaris is a system that helps educate
these teams about what they're working

194
00:12:46,421 --> 00:12:48,700
on.
And lastly,

195
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:52,390
if by any chance there's a
team was looking for a project,

196
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:57,730
Polaris can help allocate or assign
teams with different projects.

197
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,870
All right, when I talked about the
atomic unit of a research insight,

198
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:09,590
this is, this is it a, we call
it a research nugget. And uh,

199
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,680
we just celebrated a,
a little while ago, uh,

200
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:17,650
5,000 nuggets entered to Polaris
in a chicken nugget meal. Um,

201
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:23,100
so what's the nugget and I get is a
tagged observations supported by evidence

202
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:27,010
tagged observation,
supported by evidence.

203
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,350
I'll explain observation.

204
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:34,270
So observation is something that
we learned during the study.

205
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:37,630
We saw something,
we understood something,

206
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:42,940
we understood why it happened. This is
an observation. So we just type it down.

207
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,100
This is what we found and this
is what explains it. Evidence.

208
00:13:48,101 --> 00:13:50,230
There has to be,
there's no nugget.

209
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:53,860
Nothing enters Polaris without evidence.

210
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,870
It's not about the opinion of anyone.

211
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,460
There has to be evidence proof that
the observation that true is true.

212
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:05,770
That could be, um, a short video
clip. It could be 10 seconds.

213
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:09,400
It could be a minute, something
like that. It could be a photo,

214
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:13,870
it could be a screenshot of an email,
it could be a document,

215
00:14:13,871 --> 00:14:15,640
it can be whatever it is,
whatever media.

216
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:20,910
But proof and evidence that what we said
in the observation is a actually what

217
00:14:23,021 --> 00:14:27,770
happened. And lastly, and
that's what makes Polaris, um,

218
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:32,050
useful in special is a series of tags.

219
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:37,080
The first thing we did when we designed
Polaris was created a long taxonomy of

220
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:42,160
tags. How we tag things, how we tag
nuggets, uh, within that system.

221
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:46,390
So these could be, um,
tags that are pretty, uh,

222
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,070
pretty much demographic.
Uh,

223
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:52,520
so which city and name of the location,
uh,

224
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:55,430
the size of the company and so on that,

225
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,830
that the person is representing
and so on and so forth.

226
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,580
But there are also tags that
relate to the experience.

227
00:15:01,581 --> 00:15:06,581
So is this observation of
positive one neutral or negative?

228
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:10,700
Is this, um, what is
the magnitude of that?

229
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:15,590
What is the frequency and
so on and so forth. Um,

230
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:19,810
I call them the three Cs. Three
things that people can, uh,

231
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:24,770
can do in Polaris when they go into the
system. They can create the nuggets.

232
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:29,810
All right? They can search for different
nuggets under different topics and,

233
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:33,740
and um,
and create playlists from these nuggets.

234
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:38,480
They can. And this is how it looks
like. So you see, uh, an interview here.

235
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,230
So we just decide on the
clip, uh, what is the,

236
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,510
what is the length and the minute, the
second that it starts and ends, uh,

237
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,570
and that would be the evidence.
If that's a,

238
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:53,790
an interview you see a middle left to see,
uh,

239
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:57,350
an empty box for typing
down the observation, uh,

240
00:15:57,351 --> 00:16:01,820
and under right and bottom left
you see some of the tags, uh,

241
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:06,800
that we're using. Um, we tagged
by journey, we tanked by emotions,

242
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:11,210
objects and the experience
metrics that I just described.

243
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,390
And then, uh, you can also cure it.

244
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:19,220
You can add and create a playlist
and nuggets to playlists. Um,

245
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:24,020
and you can share these with
other people at we work.

246
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:29,590
Uh, this is how I played
us a look. Looks like, um,

247
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,130
you might suspect they worked
here for awhile. Um, so, uh,

248
00:16:34,131 --> 00:16:37,940
what you see, uh,
obviously the video is, uh,

249
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,810
the evidence just below it. You see other
members squatting, blah, blah, blah.

250
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,700
That's the observation and some of
the tags on the right hand side,

251
00:16:46,701 --> 00:16:51,260
on the bottom right hand side and
on the right is the playlist itself,

252
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:55,750
the different nuggets that
compile and create the playlist.

253
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,030
You can see that you have nine
nuggets there that will take you five,

254
00:16:59,031 --> 00:17:01,670
about five minutes to watch and so on.

255
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,240
People can consume,
um,

256
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:10,190
consumed these nuggets and playlists.

257
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:14,780
I compared that to a
healthy food at first. Uh,

258
00:17:14,781 --> 00:17:19,520
they don't really like it, but it's
good for them. So they have to, um,

259
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:23,870
and in time they understand that this
is useful and they use it more and more.

260
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:28,660
We see very interesting,
um, usage scenarios, uh,

261
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:33,260
tracking what's happening behind the
scenes. Um, we see people who are,

262
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:38,540
let's say there's a designer,
interior designer that designed, um,

263
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,060
a conference room at we work.

264
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:45,620
So that person is looking for a
feedback about conference room. Uh,

265
00:17:45,621 --> 00:17:48,860
we see people in building, in a
building. We saw somebody in a,

266
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:54,170
in Chicago watching all 200 nuggets
related to that building in Chicago.

267
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:58,650
Uh, and so on and so forth. We've
seen teams are making decisions,

268
00:17:58,651 --> 00:18:02,940
roadmap decisions about their products
based on what they find in Polaris.

269
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,030
I want to give you an example for that.
Um,

270
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:12,030
so to become a, we work member,
uh, you usually take a tour.

271
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,460
If you take a tour, you go through the
building you were interested in, uh,

272
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:19,350
they show you different things and then
you decide if you want to join or not.

273
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,160
Uh, we also serve coffee and we work. Uh,

274
00:18:23,161 --> 00:18:28,161
so let's say you are the general manager
of we work in Europe and you want to

275
00:18:30,781 --> 00:18:34,980
see, um, do you want to
get feedback about tours?

276
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,860
You want to understand the
situation about tours and coffee,

277
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:42,690
what's more important? You
search for negative, um,

278
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:46,710
tours in Amsterdam or
sorry, in Europe. Um,

279
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:51,600
and then you might get a dish
results 72 nuggets in the playlist.

280
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,380
And when you search for
coffee negative in Europe,

281
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:59,920
you get three nuggets. That
alone, without even watching the,

282
00:18:59,921 --> 00:19:00,660
the playlists,

283
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:05,660
that alone tells you that there might
be a bigger challenge there with tours

284
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:12,070
rather than coffee. So your
focus should be on, on, uh,

285
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,950
understanding what's happening with tours.

286
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:16,300
Okay.

287
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,010
I want to show you a quick

288
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,190
video of how it looks
like and sounds like. So,

289
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,130
uh,
we also serve be year.

290
00:19:27,131 --> 00:19:29,740
So here's some feedback about beer.

291
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,430
Oops.
Okay.

292
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,370
So you first,

293
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:45,160
this is how you start the search. You
search, these are, we call them props.

294
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,000
So beer is a prop. Uh, you search,

295
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,710
you select a location.

296
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:58,690
If you're interested in some other
filters, you apply them. If not,

297
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,010
you move on and you get the results as a,
as a playlist,

298
00:20:03,011 --> 00:20:03,970
you can save it.

299
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:08,180
Okay.

300
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:12,530
I have a very creative,
a name for this very creative description

301
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,083
and

302
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,180
let's listen to a couple
of, uh, of nuggets

303
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:33,810
having other than a [inaudible] over here.

304
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:38,410
[inaudible] that to me,
I'm no art,

305
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,553
but

306
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,180
not everybody likes beer though.

307
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:45,310
Yeah.

308
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,290
Or the fact of having beer in an office.

309
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:54,510
It was noisy and they, I think,
you know, not everybody's twice.

310
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,540
If I'm having people come
off and, you know, yeah, it's
a cool face everyday, but,

311
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:03,740
you know, having kids drink
beer and all that crap is fine,

312
00:21:03,741 --> 00:21:08,450
but I think there's a whole nother niche
for a little bit more sophisticated. Uh,

313
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:12,320
minorities or people in Ad Tech,
right?

314
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,850
So this is how it looks
like and sounds like.

315
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:20,910
I obviously pick the audio not to
expose the identity of those people.

316
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:25,870
Um, you can also watch a list,
um, a playlist as a list,

317
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:30,760
not just as a,
as a videos or photos and

318
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:32,723
of course,

319
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,640
no, no, no.

320
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,450
Sorry about that.

321
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:46,883
Okay.

322
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:52,610
All right. Um, and to sum it up,

323
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:55,730
this is division for Polaris
because this is not the end. What,

324
00:21:55,731 --> 00:22:00,140
what Polaris before I show you that
what Belarus is doing is tell you,

325
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,630
uh, tell us we work employees, uh,

326
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,170
why things aren't happening.

327
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:09,260
Our vision is also to provide
a system that tells us,

328
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:11,150
that explains what is happening.

329
00:22:11,151 --> 00:22:16,151
So we want to provide a score
for everything at we work
a quantitative score and

330
00:22:18,051 --> 00:22:22,340
then from that score lead to a
Polaris playlists. So for example,

331
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:27,320
beer, um, let's say beer
is scoring a worldwide,

332
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:30,770
there was a,
the score is 44% out of 100.

333
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:35,180
And you want to understand as the person
who's responsible for beer, do we work?

334
00:22:35,181 --> 00:22:38,660
You want to understand
why the score is so low.

335
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,940
Then you can get, um,
get to Polaris and see a,

336
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:47,570
a playlist of people talking
about, um, about beer.

337
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:52,490
The way we do that is by collecting,
for example, satisfaction feedback,

338
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:57,110
uh, through these little devices
that we created on the top left.

339
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:01,400
And we put them everywhere
in the building, um,

340
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:05,690
through surveys and through an
APP. We call this the APP, uh,

341
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:09,770
through an APP that our
teams in the buildings, uh,

342
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,720
pull out and ask people to rate different
things that are happening around them.

343
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:17,560
So this is,
uh,

344
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:22,590
how people can understand both what is
happening and then understand why it's

345
00:23:23,031 --> 00:23:27,890
happening. Uh, I couldn't help it,
but, uh, if, if you're interested,

346
00:23:27,891 --> 00:23:32,690
this is a, this is another research
project that we completed it,

347
00:23:32,691 --> 00:23:33,141
we work,

348
00:23:33,141 --> 00:23:37,970
we found that a lot of people don't
show up to tours because they,

349
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:42,210
uh, can't find the entrance to the
building. So this is how we, uh,

350
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:46,430
how we solved it.
So you can read about it there and I think

351
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:51,080
we are done. Yeah. Slide, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

352
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:56,030
Bottom this deck, if you're
interested. And second to last,

353
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,860
if you want to start it on your own,

354
00:23:57,861 --> 00:24:01,580
just check it out and see if there's
something that you can do. We created a,

355
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,850
an air table template,
uh,

356
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:08,540
for Polaris for designing your
own Polaris. So feel free to,

357
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:13,310
um, to use it. Um, I think that's it.

358
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:14,863
Thank you.

359
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,730
Okay. Hey, great.

360
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:23,960
Thank you so much for taking the
time to explain this. And, uh,

361
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:29,420
I was not expecting to have place that
we could use to starts putting together

362
00:24:29,521 --> 00:24:34,440
something like this together. So, um,
well, so some questions for you. So,

363
00:24:34,441 --> 00:24:36,030
uh, if we had to think about, you know,

364
00:24:36,031 --> 00:24:38,440
pull that reason and all
these processes from the con,

365
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,950
the producers and false starts,
uh,

366
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,530
it seems to me that there's
a bit of this assymetry.

367
00:24:43,531 --> 00:24:47,010
Where are the people who are trying to
put all these nuggets into the system or

368
00:24:47,011 --> 00:24:50,700
the guys are putting in all the hard
work so that the consumers could actually

369
00:24:50,701 --> 00:24:55,680
benefit from this. So, um, so
I mean, so in your experience,

370
00:24:55,681 --> 00:24:57,300
what have been some of the, you know, the,

371
00:24:57,301 --> 00:25:01,410
the socon more successful ways to
actually incentivize more people in your

372
00:25:01,411 --> 00:25:04,980
organization to create a
and archive these nuggets?

373
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:10,610
So at this point I would say we are
kind of a control freaks about, uh,

374
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:11,281
what's going on,

375
00:25:11,281 --> 00:25:16,020
what goes in a Polaris
outside the UX team.

376
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:20,770
Not a lot of people can, can
add nuggets to Polaris. Uh,

377
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:22,110
there are exceptions though.

378
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:27,170
The exceptions are a team that asked
us specifically to train them on.

379
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,380
It's actually a,

380
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:32,430
it's kind of a hidden way of training
teams on how to do their own research.

381
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:35,280
They want to add things to
Polaris and we say, you know what,

382
00:25:35,281 --> 00:25:38,610
let's train you on how to do research.
You'll do research.

383
00:25:38,611 --> 00:25:42,900
And then we're also training on how to
add nuggets to the system. And then,

384
00:25:42,901 --> 00:25:46,530
and then they do that. So we, so
far trained to, uh, different teams.

385
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:49,020
Sometimes there's a person that is,
you know,

386
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,200
an individual that's interested
personally in, in doing that,

387
00:25:52,201 --> 00:25:56,720
we train them as well. But
not everyone is, is, uh,

388
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:59,620
has access to do that. Okay,
great. That's interesting.

389
00:25:59,621 --> 00:26:02,190
And that actually leads me to
the next question. Uh, you know,

390
00:26:02,191 --> 00:26:05,340
because you were talking about all
these things about observations versus

391
00:26:05,341 --> 00:26:10,140
evidence. Yeah. Well, I mean, what does it
actually take to train someone, you know,

392
00:26:10,141 --> 00:26:11,460
to, to actually, uh,

393
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:16,020
so called Freeman and does something that
is acceptable as a piece of evidence.

394
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:21,890
Uh, we have conversations with the Ux
team about many things related to Polaris

395
00:26:21,891 --> 00:26:25,650
specifically about that as well.
It really depends.

396
00:26:25,651 --> 00:26:26,940
If you don't say anything,

397
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:31,710
some people would write
down and observation and
then choose as evidence the

398
00:26:31,711 --> 00:26:36,420
exact same words that the person in the
interview is saying, for example. Um,

399
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:41,190
so we asked them and train them to kind
of add some more context by extending

400
00:26:41,191 --> 00:26:45,300
the time that they, uh, as evidence. Uh,

401
00:26:45,301 --> 00:26:48,030
sometimes it's not just a recording,

402
00:26:48,031 --> 00:26:51,810
sometimes it's a photo and support that
with a photo that better explains or

403
00:26:51,811 --> 00:26:56,700
provides evidence to what you were
just saying. Um, it's not easy.

404
00:26:56,850 --> 00:27:00,420
Um, we have a lot of
conversations about the quality,

405
00:27:00,421 --> 00:27:03,960
what qualifies as a great nugget.
And so on. We also have a term,

406
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:07,470
a kind of internal Tammy,
you don't see it in the system.

407
00:27:07,471 --> 00:27:08,910
We call it the golden nugget.

408
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:14,160
A golden nugget is a nugget that is so
special that you learned something really

409
00:27:16,891 --> 00:27:18,990
important from it.
It's really actionable.

410
00:27:18,991 --> 00:27:21,840
It's something that we say it's like
a headbanger. It's like, Oh man,

411
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:25,950
we have to do something about that.
Um, how many percent of your nuggets?

412
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:30,480
Golden Nuggets. Oh, very few.
Very, very few. Okay. Yeah.

413
00:27:30,481 --> 00:27:31,910
So I was wondering,
you know, because yeah,

414
00:27:31,911 --> 00:27:36,240
it's that he's a sudden trash whole
data piece of evidence needs to meet.

415
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:39,570
So, um, so with those
situations when, you know,

416
00:27:39,571 --> 00:27:44,571
there might be t employees who actually
disagree about the evidence that go into

417
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:49,080
nuggets or sometimes the fact that
the evidence might be okay in itself,

418
00:27:49,081 --> 00:27:52,560
but it's not relevant to the observation.
So what are you guys,

419
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,890
what I'm going to say didn't happen yet.
We didn't implement this,

420
00:27:55,891 --> 00:27:58,860
but this is something
that we're working on. Um,

421
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:04,500
as we train new people and
adding a nuggets and evidence to,

422
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:08,580
to Polaris, uh, we want to
great different roles of people.

423
00:28:08,581 --> 00:28:12,630
And then if you are a kind of a Newbie,
a nugget Isare we call it,

424
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,370
then,
uh,

425
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:19,820
then somebody will have to review and
approve your maybe first 100 nuggets.

426
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:24,180
So there's another eye that looks
at things. It's not just you.

427
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:29,310
So we hope to somehow compensate for
things that don't count as evidence for

428
00:28:29,311 --> 00:28:32,460
example. Okay. Yeah. And
then, well, as you mentioned,

429
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:35,760
in order to know how good is the most
atomic units of research findings,

430
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:39,540
but sometimes our consumers
don't really once, uh, two,

431
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:43,050
two cats finding at that
level of granularity,

432
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:47,040
they want something like a higher level
team that integrates and synthesizes

433
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:51,610
many different nuggets. So do
you guys provide any support
for that? Right now? Uh,

434
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,320
we create,
we also create and curate playlists.

435
00:28:55,710 --> 00:29:00,660
So these are UX create a curated playlist
and we shared them with teams so we

436
00:29:00,661 --> 00:29:05,280
can do their work. We have a way to,
it's like, in a way, it's like a report,

437
00:29:05,281 --> 00:29:09,330
but it's a playlist with, uh,
maybe a few more words about it,

438
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:11,490
some analysis into what is it that you're,

439
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:15,960
you're seeing in the playlist
and so on. So we do that. Um,

440
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:21,150
and, and sometimes we train others
to do that as well. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

441
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:24,630
So now switching over to the
consumer side of things. Um,

442
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,500
so what have you guys found to be the
types and characteristics of research

443
00:29:28,501 --> 00:29:32,290
nuggets that were more
useful to consumers? So I,

444
00:29:32,291 --> 00:29:36,540
I touched a little bit
earlier. Um, sometimes nuggets,

445
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:40,000
and these are the nuggets is
that people who enter them, um,

446
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,260
they just in an observation that
just describe what happened. Uh,

447
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,140
that's not true. Not
really useful. So, uh,

448
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:53,320
the person said that beer is having
beer in an office is not a good idea.

449
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:58,030
That's not enough. As, as a nugget,

450
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:03,070
we want to understand why or they held
a me maybe describe something more

451
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,930
meaningful.
Um,

452
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:10,710
the members said that they're taking
meetings in a coffee shop rather than in

453
00:30:11,111 --> 00:30:14,140
our conference rooms.
Interesting. But still,

454
00:30:14,141 --> 00:30:17,380
it's not a nugget because
we don't understand why. Um,

455
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:22,840
and if they add the why, for example,
they do that because we work as too noisy.

456
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:28,360
Then we have something that
we can do something about.
So, uh, this is meaningful.

457
00:30:28,361 --> 00:30:31,630
This is something that hints
that there's a problem there.

458
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:35,800
And we know what the problem is and if
we search for noise and certainly if it's

459
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:39,760
tagged by noise and conference rooms,
and if we search for that,

460
00:30:39,761 --> 00:30:43,900
for lifts like that in Polaris and
see, I don't know, 120 nuggets,

461
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:47,830
we know we have a problem there that
we need to do something about. Uh,

462
00:30:47,831 --> 00:30:51,040
so these nuggets must be,
um,

463
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:54,460
kind of a unit and atomic unit
and it's not an atomic unit if,

464
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:58,360
if it doesn't have that,
why? Okay. Got It. Yeah.

465
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,830
So some product questions now because man,
uh,

466
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
understanding an impression about Polaris
when watching our presentation is that

467
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:10,510
there's always a pension in computing
systems between poo and push mechanisms.

468
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:15,560
Uh, Polaris seems to be something
that's more pool driven.
Yep. Uh, and you know, if,

469
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:16,451
well,

470
00:31:16,451 --> 00:31:20,470
what might be some opportunities to think
about supporting more push mechanisms.

471
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:23,260
So currently we have a
manual push mechanism.

472
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,050
We push lists to people.

473
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:30,820
We heard you've been working
on ordering beer for, we work.

474
00:31:30,821 --> 00:31:33,280
Here's a playlist of, of people, uh,

475
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:37,810
members from all of the world talking
about beer. Uh, that's very manual.

476
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:42,430
Um, one other thing that that's
a feature can have an on our,

477
00:31:42,431 --> 00:31:45,820
on our roadmap, um, is uh,

478
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:50,970
updating you as somebody who either showed
some kind of interest in a playlist.

479
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:55,360
Either you created it or
it was shared with you. Um,

480
00:31:56,050 --> 00:32:00,880
each time there's a new nugget that is
being added to the list and it's being

481
00:32:00,881 --> 00:32:05,230
added automatically because of the tags,
you'll get a notification about that.

482
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:09,010
And then we hope that this will
encourage people to try it out more.

483
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:12,550
That's a great ideal. You know, as soon
as you were talking about tagging, um,

484
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,780
I was wondering when you guys
were designing Polaris, uh,

485
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:17,080
besides attacking approach,

486
00:32:17,081 --> 00:32:21,610
were there any other considerations
that you guys considered for other

487
00:32:21,611 --> 00:32:26,260
approaches to organizing
the nuggets? Uh, no,

488
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:31,120
not really. Um, the only
thing we were not sure of, we,

489
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:34,120
it was very clear for us
that this was an investment.

490
00:32:34,121 --> 00:32:39,121
So we wanted to be sure that this is
working before we kind of make that

491
00:32:39,441 --> 00:32:44,120
investment. So we created that template
that I shared. We created everything, uh,

492
00:32:44,121 --> 00:32:46,580
with air table,
um,

493
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:51,140
stored everything on the video recordings,
on Youtube store,

494
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:55,190
audio recordings on soundcloud.
And that was our system.

495
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:00,650
Um, as soon as we saw the reaction
to it, um, we decided, okay,

496
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:05,050
this is worthwhile. And then
we invested the time in, um,

497
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,230
changing all of that to a system
that we can control and okay.

498
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:11,760
That makes total sense to me.
Um,

499
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:16,430
well what are some of the challenges to
scaling something that Polaris and what

500
00:33:16,431 --> 00:33:19,310
are you guys doing about that?
Um,

501
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:22,610
so I would say there are two
challenges that are kind of related.

502
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:26,890
One is that it needs to be something that,

503
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:30,500
that people like we work are aware of.
Cause if they're not aware of it,

504
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,120
obviously they're not going to use it.

505
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:36,560
And the other challenge is once they
are aware and they search for something,

506
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,230
they have to see.
I don't know if you noticed the dates,

507
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:42,200
they have to see nuggets
that are relatively new.

508
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,500
Otherwise they think it's an old,
uh,

509
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,730
database of information and they're
not going to do anything about it.

510
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:53,690
Although we all know that sometimes,
uh,

511
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:56,960
even if you found something a year or
two ago, it doesn't mean that it's old.

512
00:33:56,961 --> 00:33:59,720
It doesn't, it doesn't mean that it's
not true, but that's how people treat it.

513
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:03,440
So we, our challenge is
to keep it fresh. Um,

514
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:08,510
and these are the challenges
because to keep it fresh,

515
00:34:08,511 --> 00:34:13,490
it means that more people need to
do research and nuggetize that, um,

516
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:18,470
more and more. And that's something
that we don't always have time to do.

517
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:22,070
And awareness is, is
again, always a challenge.

518
00:34:22,071 --> 00:34:26,060
We need to push and talk about it
and mentioned it in every meeting.

519
00:34:26,061 --> 00:34:29,810
When somebody asks us a question, we
shouldn't just answer, we should say.

520
00:34:29,811 --> 00:34:32,240
And that's what we try and do
and remember ourselves to do.

521
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:35,060
Have you checked out Polaris?
Do you know what the virus is?

522
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,450
Maybe show them and then they start
using it on their own? Yeah, I mean,

523
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:41,200
do you guys have, I
mean, at a system level,

524
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:45,860
you actually have a way to
designate certain of those
nuggets as golden nuggets.

525
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:50,890
So that it stuff, it's just
a jargon between, yeah.

526
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:55,160
Um, so what are some of the considerations
around personally identifiable

527
00:34:55,161 --> 00:34:57,980
information? I mean, I saw that
you guys had to, uh, you know,

528
00:34:57,981 --> 00:35:02,740
just blackout the faces and that's, that's
only for the presentation. But yeah,

529
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,880
uh, that's a, that's a challenge. I mean,

530
00:35:04,881 --> 00:35:09,560
we covered the identity of the
person itself. So the member,

531
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:12,950
the company name is not it,
it's,

532
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:17,450
it's a kind of a encrypted throats code.
And uh,

533
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:21,890
the same for the person's name. We
don't even add it to the system. Um,

534
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:27,170
that said, if you are, our people in the
buildings are called community teams.

535
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:31,700
If you're a community manager and you see
a video of a member from your building,

536
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:36,170
you would know them. Even though you have
a thousand members, you would know them.

537
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:40,050
So are always concerned with
people taking it the wrong way,

538
00:35:40,051 --> 00:35:43,530
especially if the feedback or
the nugget is talking about you,

539
00:35:43,531 --> 00:35:47,970
the community manager.
So we ask the people we talk with,

540
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:52,230
not to mention names. So just
say, so we say, for example,

541
00:35:52,231 --> 00:35:56,460
if you have feedback about,
uh, your community manager,

542
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:01,380
use that term. My community
managers don't use a name. Um,

543
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:04,640
they don't always follow instructions,
but we tried.

544
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:09,140
You guys do about evidence if they don't
follow instructions. Uh, so it's, it's,

545
00:36:09,141 --> 00:36:13,770
it's something we have to cut and, and,
and, and not include. Cause that's a,

546
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,990
we don't want people to use it as,
you know,

547
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,640
I saw you saying something bad about
me. Why are you doing that? Um,

548
00:36:20,641 --> 00:36:24,570
that's always a challenge. But at
least the name and the company name,

549
00:36:24,571 --> 00:36:28,770
they're not included in Polaris. They
can, they can see that. Okay. Yeah.

550
00:36:28,771 --> 00:36:32,730
So going I think to more broader
organizational wide issues. I mean,

551
00:36:32,731 --> 00:36:36,360
what do you see as some of the necessary
conditions that need to be in place for

552
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:40,230
organizations to actually adopt your
ideas around Polaris effectively?

553
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:44,340
Um, honestly, uh,

554
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,890
I, I, I couldn't care less. I mean,

555
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:52,590
it's really,
honestly,

556
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,210
I'll tell you that when I described
Polaris to important people that we work,

557
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:00,630
I was asked not to do it before we did it.
Um,

558
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,550
this is something that, uh, I'm
sure other researchers here are,

559
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,890
um, not foreign to the problems
that I described. A, this is,

560
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,110
these are problems that are
happening for many years.

561
00:37:13,111 --> 00:37:17,820
In many companies and it was very clear
to us that this is something that we

562
00:37:17,821 --> 00:37:18,870
work with benefit from.

563
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:24,360
So if the company is doing research
or is beginning to do research,

564
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:28,980
it's relevant. Other considerations,
I think everything is solvable.

565
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:31,440
We have challenges with
making people aware of it,

566
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:34,560
but that's something we need to deal with.
This is what the company needs.

567
00:37:34,561 --> 00:37:39,300
This is the healthy food they needed,
although it's not tasty at first. Okay.

568
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,413
Well,

569
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,430
so do you know of any other organizations
that have already adopted your ideas

570
00:37:44,431 --> 00:37:47,340
around Polaris? Uh,
since we made it public,

571
00:37:47,341 --> 00:37:51,960
a lot of companies contacted us. Uh, I
don't really know if they implemented it,

572
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:56,820
but um, all of Google's
competitors, uh, kept in touch.

573
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,980
I have no idea if, if they do anything
about it, but there's interest,

574
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:03,600
I don't really know. Wow. Okay.

575
00:38:03,601 --> 00:38:07,230
And I think that as a way to encourage
us to try to adopt some of these ideas.

576
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:12,000
I'll be honest, I tried here, but,
uh, I didn't get a lot of traction.

577
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:16,140
Um,
I think what you see here is a,

578
00:38:16,141 --> 00:38:17,430
and we talked about it earlier,

579
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:21,150
you see research archives and these
research archives that you see here,

580
00:38:21,151 --> 00:38:25,950
our archives that you can just
upload your report and uh,

581
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:30,800
maybe tagging, I can't
remember. Oh, sure. Um,

582
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:35,590
I think it's not enough. It's not,
it's not atomic enough. And, um,

583
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,870
and when you're tagging your not and
you're thinking about the entire study of

584
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,060
thinking about the entire report,

585
00:38:40,061 --> 00:38:44,110
the reports are long include many things
and the insights as I described earlier

586
00:38:44,111 --> 00:38:46,910
and so on. So I would say, uh,

587
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:52,030
no you don't have it and um,
maybe it's an opportunity. Okay.

588
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:53,561
Well,
uh,

589
00:38:53,561 --> 00:38:56,740
so we have 15 minutes left and I just
wanted to make sure that members of the

590
00:38:56,741 --> 00:38:59,110
audience get to ask any
questions that you guys have.

591
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:02,440
So we have mice on the two
ends of the room. Free,

592
00:39:02,441 --> 00:39:05,830
free to just step out and ask her
questions so that the rest of the room can

593
00:39:05,831 --> 00:39:06,790
hear your questions.

594
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:08,883
Okay.

595
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,260
I'm in an organization that loves research
reports and I'd love to know a little

596
00:39:14,261 --> 00:39:16,450
bit besides just developing a tool,

597
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:20,220
how you weaned people off
of their dependency on it.

598
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,760
Why, why do they love the reports?
I'm sure they don't have reports.

599
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:25,550
They love the research because it's known.
Yeah.

600
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,190
There like familiar so familiar
way that they're used to.

601
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:32,170
You're talking about the researchers
or, or uh, the consumers of research,

602
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:35,300
consumers of research, internal,
internal clients of research.

603
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,013
I,
I,

604
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:40,500
to me the biggest insult as a researcher
is when people read the report and they

605
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:42,790
say, hmm, interesting. Um,

606
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:46,930
I want it to be actionable and um,

607
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:51,120
I think that if you track and
see, I'm not gonna, I'm gonna,

608
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:53,380
I'm not gonna you know,
really you hear,

609
00:39:53,381 --> 00:39:56,860
but are they doing anything with
these risk research reports?

610
00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:01,660
If the answer is no or not really or
not, you know, what you expected, then,

611
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:05,620
uh, I would say don't listen
to what they say about reports,

612
00:40:05,621 --> 00:40:09,550
look at their behavior as you
know, and uh, treat them as users.

613
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:13,670
This is a design challenge and see
what you can do about it. Well,

614
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:18,280
Iris is not the only answer, I'm sure.
Uh, it's just one possible answer.

615
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,130
If reports worked for them and
you're happy and they're happy,

616
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:23,080
don't find them off of that.

617
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,513
Okay.

618
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:30,620
Take some air for your presentation
I think is super interesting.

619
00:40:30,621 --> 00:40:32,480
And of course as a researcher,

620
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:37,840
I'm always looking for any tool that can
help us not only capture feedback but

621
00:40:39,021 --> 00:40:41,510
also communicate it with my stakeholders.

622
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:46,400
I noticed one of the images that
you had or you have a device,

623
00:40:46,401 --> 00:40:50,450
a physical device, one of the phone
rooms. Yeah. So two questions.

624
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:54,830
One is, um, how does it work?

625
00:40:54,831 --> 00:40:58,010
How is this connected
to Polaris and second,

626
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:02,480
why using a physical device instead
of sending a survey to your,

627
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:04,670
um,
to the consumer?

628
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:09,640
Very, very, very good question.
So, um, the product that is,

629
00:41:09,641 --> 00:41:13,660
we work is, has many, many details, many,

630
00:41:13,661 --> 00:41:18,310
many things that create it. Um, we think
it's hundreds of hundreds of things.

631
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:22,330
It's the beer and it's the,
the chairs and it's the, the,

632
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:26,830
the wallpaper and the events and the
community team and so many other things.

633
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,230
It doesn't make any sense to ask
about 500 things. In a survey,

634
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,330
uh, nobody would complete it. Um,

635
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:39,770
that's one reason we don't
solely use surveys for, uh,

636
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,280
for these, uh, quantitative
measurements. Um,

637
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:48,340
we also know that especially for
physical things and objects and spaces,

638
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:53,870
the best way to collect
feedback is there in context.

639
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:58,740
So imagine a, a conference room.
So you booked a conference room.

640
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,680
Let's say the next time
you book a conference room,

641
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:04,440
you have a popup question on
your screen that asks you, uh,

642
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:08,690
how has your recent experience with
the conference room you just, um,

643
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:12,950
you used maybe five days
ago. Uh, we have that,

644
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:17,000
but we learned from
members that in many cases,

645
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:21,980
first they don't remember
how was the experience. Uh,

646
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:26,270
and two, they, uh, the person
who is booking the room,

647
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:31,490
it's not necessarily the person who is
using it. So the feedback is very biased.

648
00:42:31,491 --> 00:42:34,580
So in context is the best
because we know you're there,

649
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:39,320
we know you just use the room, give us
your feedback. And that's it. That said,

650
00:42:39,321 --> 00:42:41,140
it's not connected to Polaris.
Uh,

651
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:46,240
this is a different system that gathers
all this data about a scoring different

652
00:42:46,461 --> 00:42:47,630
spaces and other things.

653
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:51,590
And then you get a score for different
things and locations and regions.

654
00:42:51,591 --> 00:42:53,480
And so on.
From there,

655
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:58,540
we take that and we link that with a
relevant Polaris or we would that's not

656
00:42:58,941 --> 00:43:03,560
connected yet. That's the vision. Connect
that to a Polaris playlist, as I said.

657
00:43:03,561 --> 00:43:08,561
So if you see the data about beer is
flowing to and creating that score in a

658
00:43:10,731 --> 00:43:14,240
dashboard somewhere,
uh, and then that score,

659
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:19,270
you'll have a link next to it that we'll
connect you to a playlist about beer in

660
00:43:19,491 --> 00:43:24,380
Polaris. And these devices are based
on, we created them. It's uh, these are,

661
00:43:24,381 --> 00:43:27,740
uh, Amazon dash buttons and the
casing is something we designed.

662
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:31,930
Okay.
Uh,

663
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:37,090
so one of the things that
reports sometimes we'll do
is give you the background

664
00:43:37,161 --> 00:43:40,820
of the research that happens and
action items that happen afterwards.

665
00:43:40,821 --> 00:43:45,620
How do you see your tool taking into
account when significant change or impact

666
00:43:45,621 --> 00:43:48,170
has already come from
the nuggets that exist?

667
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:50,340
So that's says democracy.
I'm talking about,

668
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:53,310
I'm almost eliminating the
researcher from the equation here.

669
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:58,220
I want the person who is watching the,
creating the playlist,

670
00:43:58,221 --> 00:44:01,470
watching it and deciding what to do next.

671
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:06,300
I want them to create that for themselves.
They decide,

672
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:08,400
they know what happened before,

673
00:44:08,401 --> 00:44:12,060
they know about the background and they
know what they can learn from what they

674
00:44:12,061 --> 00:44:16,150
just saw. The researcher is
there to help them. I want my,

675
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:20,520
my idea is that everyone's a researcher.
I want everyone to do that.

676
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:24,180
Currently we're kind of in
a transition mode where, uh,

677
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:29,280
researchers and other Ux people are
contributing or adding nuggets to Polaris.

678
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:33,620
But as the consumer of
it, let's say a, um,

679
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:36,690
that's equated to what's happening here
at product manager or an engineering

680
00:44:36,691 --> 00:44:40,710
team or, or whoever is deciding,
uh, something about a product.

681
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:46,110
I see them as the ones that
almost write these for themselves.

682
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:47,670
It doesn't have to be in writing,

683
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:52,320
has to be an understanding that they
have what they know, what this, uh,

684
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:53,760
what this can help them with,

685
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:57,930
what decisions they can take based on
that and so on. There's no, that's,

686
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:02,460
that's exactly what the democracy I
talked about. Um, it's not, uh, you know,

687
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:06,050
at least when we use Polaris,
the way I'm describing it, uh,

688
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:09,790
those decisions are not in the hands of,
um,

689
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,720
researchers to write in a report.

690
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,320
This is in the hands of consumers,

691
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:19,470
people who are actually designing
what to do with the products.

692
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:22,540
One quick followup I guess.
Yeah.

693
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:27,550
You prevent duplicate research from
happening around her at the same time.

694
00:45:28,791 --> 00:45:31,430
So say if a community manager in Chicago,

695
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:36,660
it goes through some nuggets and on
beer and decides to take action based on

696
00:45:37,491 --> 00:45:40,850
those nuggets. And then a community
manager here does the same thing.

697
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:45,510
Does it duplicate the work or do you
think they're just building on top of each

698
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,353
other?

699
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:52,090
So when it comes to what we call
consumables, beer, coffee, and so on,

700
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:56,680
it's not that every building is deciding.
Not always. Every building is deciding,

701
00:45:56,681 --> 00:46:01,440
deciding what to buy. It's
being centralized. So it's
not really about them. Uh,

702
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:06,160
but if two different people decide
to improve the member experience,

703
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:08,920
that's a good thing. That didn't
happen before. So that's a good thing.

704
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:13,270
I don't see that as a problem. Consistency
is not necessarily a must always.

705
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:19,580
Hi. I actually had a similar question and
just to follow up some curious, are Ken,

706
00:46:19,581 --> 00:46:22,970
those community managers actually
track that so they're aware of what's

707
00:46:22,971 --> 00:46:27,230
happening and what's track
what the outcomes are,

708
00:46:27,231 --> 00:46:29,300
actions taken based on the nuggets?

709
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:31,970
Uh, not in Polaris. No.

710
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:36,660
So you can't necessarily see how
someone else, no, you're fine.

711
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:38,330
Do you think that's important or no?

712
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:43,180
Um, I think we work as a lot
of systems in place for, uh,

713
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:44,480
for doing that.
We're not trying,

714
00:46:44,481 --> 00:46:47,570
I think it's important that we're
not trying to solve that with,

715
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:50,180
with Polaris we thought about kind of,

716
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:55,130
we thought about adding a feature which
was there for maybe two minutes and then

717
00:46:55,131 --> 00:46:59,810
we removed that of kind of allowing
people who use a certain playlist that

718
00:46:59,811 --> 00:47:04,580
indicates a certain problem to raise
their hand digitally in the system as

719
00:47:04,581 --> 00:47:08,570
people want to be a part of a
team that solves the problem. Um,

720
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:12,350
but then we were afraid that Polaris
is going to be become a kind of a,

721
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:15,320
instead of a research tool, it's
going to be a project management tool.

722
00:47:15,321 --> 00:47:17,610
So we stop there.
Okay.

723
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:18,783
Okay.

724
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:21,770
Okay. Hi, uh,

725
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:26,520
so any evidence on how this has changed,
uh,

726
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:28,940
research reports that we work?
Is it dead?

727
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:30,123
It changed resource

728
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:33,380
reports because we just don't
write them. Yeah. I'm curious how,

729
00:47:33,381 --> 00:47:35,380
how has that changed the culture?

730
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:39,310
It's for, you know, anything
that happens in my group,

731
00:47:39,311 --> 00:47:43,210
we don't write research reports. It's
really, really hard for some people,

732
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,000
but we're overcoming that.
Um,

733
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:50,500
and instead of writing a research
report that if we really have the urge,

734
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:54,280
we just create a playlist and then,
uh,

735
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:58,120
if we want to add things that
we would have added to a report,

736
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:02,680
we added as a feature
request for Polaris and, and,

737
00:48:02,681 --> 00:48:07,450
and we make that happen if
it's really, really needed.
Um, that makes us, you know,

738
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:12,190
we ask ourselves very hard
questions sometimes. Uh, what
is evidence? For example,

739
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:15,760
do we really need, so
there was one request, uh,

740
00:48:15,761 --> 00:48:18,460
to add multiple files as evidence.

741
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:23,470
Do we really need three photos that show
the same thing from different angles?

742
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:28,690
Not always a, do we need a photo
combined with an audio file?

743
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:33,120
Maybe. Um, and so on. But yeah, for a,

744
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:34,920
yeah.

745
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:38,400
Anything related to my group, we don't,
we don't write research reports. Uh,

746
00:48:38,401 --> 00:48:42,210
the hardest thing by the way is by,
you know, when we share that with,

747
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:47,010
uh, executives that are
used to reading reports,

748
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:51,610
uh, it's sometimes a process and
education is involved in, you know,

749
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:55,950
communicating that this is a report, this
playlist, this is the report. That's it.

750
00:48:57,510 --> 00:48:58,343
Okay.

751
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:02,120
Just a followup question. Yep. So, um,

752
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:07,240
in terms of decision making
and how do you prevent,

753
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:09,090
um,
product manager,

754
00:49:09,091 --> 00:49:14,091
sort of decision makers to take what
users said at what the community says at

755
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:21,070
face value without like photo there,
um,

756
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:24,730
analysis or maybe without checking the
golden nuggets and you were imagining.

757
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:27,450
So,
uh,

758
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:32,460
I'm sure you know that what users say
that is the solution to their problem is

759
00:49:34,131 --> 00:49:38,840
in many cases not the solution
to the problem. So we,

760
00:49:38,841 --> 00:49:43,700
you exercise know that. So we don't even
include that in, in, uh, in the nuggets.

761
00:49:43,701 --> 00:49:47,840
So they won't see that.
Um, it is a process.

762
00:49:47,841 --> 00:49:49,850
This is why we work with these teams.

763
00:49:49,851 --> 00:49:54,851
It is a process to teach people and mentor
people on how to make sense out of a

764
00:49:55,941 --> 00:49:59,240
playlist. And, uh, I should say, I mean,

765
00:49:59,241 --> 00:50:04,040
even for a very basic, um,
I dunno, usability tests,

766
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:09,320
if you put people in a room or watch
videos, whatever, who are not researchers,

767
00:50:09,321 --> 00:50:11,960
not your Xers,
never seen a usability test.

768
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:14,780
They see videos of people
using their product.

769
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:20,650
After an hour of watching
these day, we'll have, uh,

770
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:24,820
enough information to come
up with decisions on what
to change in the product.

771
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:29,870
And these will be very good decisions
and in 99% of the cases. So I'm not,

772
00:50:29,871 --> 00:50:33,140
I'm not concerned about that
at all. Okay. My last question,

773
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:38,850
you have researchers make or do you
have researchers making the editorial

774
00:50:38,851 --> 00:50:40,260
decisions about what's worth putting in?

775
00:50:40,261 --> 00:50:42,300
So if you have a steady three out of five,

776
00:50:42,301 --> 00:50:45,840
four and a five for one
and a five run into this,

777
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:50,160
do you pick one that's representative
and put that in as a problem and flag it?

778
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:52,590
Do you put all three in combined?
What does that look like?

779
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:58,810
Most of the nuggets that go into Polaris
or not of not coming from studies,

780
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:03,460
they're coming with ongoing conversations
and interviews we have with members

781
00:51:03,461 --> 00:51:05,320
mostly with, um, uh,

782
00:51:05,321 --> 00:51:09,580
we call them graduating members with
members and decided to leave us. Um,

783
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,850
we, we think not because they're
pissed at us necessarily.

784
00:51:12,851 --> 00:51:14,950
We think this is a good time,
uh,

785
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:18,640
for us to talk with them because they
understand what's worked well at we work

786
00:51:18,641 --> 00:51:22,720
and what works not so well. It's
we work. So this is not a study.

787
00:51:22,721 --> 00:51:27,070
This is something we do all
the time and it's, it's,

788
00:51:27,090 --> 00:51:29,440
it's almost never a one at a five,
two out of five,

789
00:51:29,441 --> 00:51:33,550
three out of five thing that
comes to play when you search for,

790
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:36,190
uh,
for nuggets and create playlists.

791
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:40,780
So that's the example I gave with
the tours and, and, and coffee. Um,

792
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:44,530
you see three nuggets.
That's your three. That's it.

793
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:47,740
That's evidence that the only three
nuggets about bad coffee, I don't know,

794
00:51:48,130 --> 00:51:51,960
then probably it's not
a problem. Um, and, um,

795
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:55,450
it's very rarely that
we, I mean, not rarely,

796
00:51:55,451 --> 00:52:00,451
but we sometimes do these studies and
then we just don't take it as one of the

797
00:52:00,491 --> 00:52:03,490
five. They had a fight. We just look at,

798
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,250
let's say an interview or
observation or whatever it is,

799
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:11,200
and we just derived these nuggets and
that's it. And then they go into Polaris,

800
00:52:11,201 --> 00:52:15,010
into the ether, and then anyone can
search and create whatever they want,

801
00:52:15,011 --> 00:52:19,180
but then, hmm, okay. Yeah. I just
want to antibiotic treatment.

802
00:52:19,181 --> 00:52:20,130
It's been 40 hours.

803
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:24,010
So that does enough time for interested
folks who checkouts copies of his book

804
00:52:24,011 --> 00:52:25,960
behind. So we bet, uh,

805
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:28,720
please join me in thanking [inaudible]
once again for joining us today.

806
00:52:29,290 --> 00:52:29,570
Excellent.
