1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,920
Thank you so much.
Thank you David.

2
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:11,560
And for those of you don't know,
David,

3
00:00:11,561 --> 00:00:14,380
David is really one of the
pioneers of executive coaching,

4
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:18,460
really one of the people who I think have
written so thoughtfully and inspiring

5
00:00:18,461 --> 00:00:22,090
ways about where we can
find a life that matters.

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,660
And that's what's so terrific to have
an opportunity to talk with all of you

7
00:00:25,661 --> 00:00:30,040
about today. Here at Google. I feel like
I've been in a Google office every week.

8
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:34,840
I was just in Singapore and London and
New York and I'm on my way to Joburg when

9
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:39,610
this is the front desk at Burg,
uh, Google. It's how's it jumbo?

10
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:44,380
And so I feel so welcome when I come
here and I love coming to Google because

11
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:48,880
it's a particularly point in time for
me because I started on a passion play

12
00:00:48,881 --> 00:00:53,410
about 20 years ago where
I was in a late night.

13
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,530
Nightcap will admit it was
one o'clock in the morning.

14
00:00:56,531 --> 00:01:00,910
We were in Switzerland and we
were jet lagged and exhausted.

15
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,110
And I was talking to a couple of famous
Googlers. It was Larry and Sergey.

16
00:01:05,111 --> 00:01:08,740
They were at the World Economic Forum
and we were all just gushing about having

17
00:01:08,741 --> 00:01:11,710
met someone iconic in our lives
that we never thought we would need.

18
00:01:11,711 --> 00:01:15,640
It was one of his last public appearances.
It was Nelson Mandela,

19
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:21,160
and we're thinking about how this guy
should have been the most angry man in

20
00:01:21,161 --> 00:01:23,950
Africa and yeah.
What did he do with his life?

21
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:29,670
He decided to reinvent a life
that mattered for millions
in rethinking the way

22
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,690
that he could have impact and a
sense of belonging for a culture,

23
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,140
and that set me on a path that
would be life changing for me.

24
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:42,130
I had been building businesses most
of my career as an entrepreneur and I

25
00:01:42,131 --> 00:01:45,640
decided that I wanted to pursue this
question of how to create a life that

26
00:01:45,641 --> 00:01:47,410
matter.
Could we find the DNA?

27
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:52,440
Could we find some ingredients by
interviewing enough successful,

28
00:01:52,481 --> 00:01:56,500
high achieving people around the planet
and could we unlock some of those

29
00:01:56,501 --> 00:01:58,540
secrets?
Please come and sit down.

30
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:02,440
I'm loving the opportunity also to be on
live streaming and for those of you who

31
00:02:02,441 --> 00:02:05,530
did get books and didn't get books,
I'll make sure that you get free copies.

32
00:02:05,531 --> 00:02:10,120
So just ping me through the Google
network and for those that I might see in

33
00:02:10,121 --> 00:02:12,220
other cities,
please let me know if you're interested.

34
00:02:12,221 --> 00:02:16,060
I'd love to share with you
a little research that we
learned about how to create

35
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,360
a life that matters and so here's
where I want to go. With that,

36
00:02:19,361 --> 00:02:22,660
I want to start with just a little piece
of archival footage here of just the

37
00:02:22,661 --> 00:02:26,980
first 60 seconds of the first interview
we did starting in 1998 and I'm going to

38
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:30,700
bring you to present and then share with
you eight of the principals out of the

39
00:02:30,701 --> 00:02:34,090
36 that we learned and the eight that
I've picked is big because they are the

40
00:02:34,091 --> 00:02:37,990
most, I think, hidden from
our souls and from the public.

41
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,700
They are the ones that
aren't talked about,

42
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:43,690
the ones that have the biggest impact.
And let me share with you, herb Kelleher,

43
00:02:43,691 --> 00:02:47,380
kind of a famously happy guy who
seems to create a life that matters,

44
00:02:47,381 --> 00:02:49,570
even though he's really just
running a discount airline.

45
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,890
Oh,
so what job are we going to get it?

46
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,900
And you can't really screw up.

47
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,530
Hey,
how are you?

48
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:21,690
So it was amazing to be able
to meet people like herb,

49
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,960
who in a sadly on unusual way,

50
00:03:24,961 --> 00:03:27,960
when you meet CEOs aren't
necessarily the most happy people.

51
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,480
And when you talked to him,

52
00:03:30,481 --> 00:03:32,670
you could see how that filters
through the organization.

53
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:35,640
How many of you've ever been on
southwest airlines? Of course. Yeah,

54
00:03:35,641 --> 00:03:36,620
we've all had to do that.
You,

55
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,490
I was kinda coming here on southwest
airlines and I had the typical safety talk

56
00:03:41,491 --> 00:03:44,820
that you get on southwest. Now these
people can't be paid all that much.

57
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,570
Not In money at least. But why is it
that they're just a little happier?

58
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,740
A little bit more engaged, maybe a
little insane. Have you noticed this?

59
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:56,190
We were like rolling out on the runway
and the flight attendant was giving us

60
00:03:56,191 --> 00:03:59,730
the safety talk. You know, nobody's
listening. We're all reading our devices.

61
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,280
Can you starts to pretend
to be angry. He says, guys,

62
00:04:02,281 --> 00:04:07,020
if this plane falls out of the sky,
would you like to know the documentation?

63
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,690
You can hear the thud. You know,
people are dropping everything.

64
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,930
What's this guy up to us? It's
okay. Here's what's going to happen.

65
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,480
If there's a change in cabin pressure
or there's a crisis in the year and

66
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:18,690
they're going to be the little yellow
masks that pop out of the ceiling.

67
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:23,250
Now folks, those are oxygen
masks. Now don't start to ask,

68
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,350
why is my mask smaller than his mask?

69
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,250
Why is my mask inconveniencing the
meeting that I'm supposed to hold? No,

70
00:04:29,251 --> 00:04:33,210
grab of the mask, put it on yourself
first and then put it on your child.

71
00:04:33,211 --> 00:04:34,560
And if you have more than one child,

72
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,340
you might want to stop and consider
which one really has the most potential.

73
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,650
And that's what I want to talk about here
because this is how when you talked to

74
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:46,800
her, when we did that
interview, he was, he drank a,

75
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:51,870
I think a full scotch. Uh, the, the bottle
was empty by the time we were talking.

76
00:04:51,871 --> 00:04:53,580
Two hours didn't seem
to affect him in bed.

77
00:04:53,581 --> 00:04:57,480
He went through two packs of cigarettes,
was blowing this, the it off screen.

78
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,220
He said,
you know,

79
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:04,230
mark and people will not decide and choose
explicitly and intentionally to live

80
00:05:04,231 --> 00:05:07,380
a life that matters. We have to take
a moment and recalibrate. You know,

81
00:05:07,381 --> 00:05:08,580
we're not Nelson Mandela.

82
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,150
There's probably many times during your
life when you redefine what success

83
00:05:12,151 --> 00:05:14,610
means and what that
definition of success is.

84
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:18,090
So let's look at the factors that
we discovered in this research.

85
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,750
And one of them had to do with the fact
that in a world that's so volatile and

86
00:05:21,751 --> 00:05:25,320
changing, we're all on this mission
to find a sense of belonging,

87
00:05:25,321 --> 00:05:27,860
to create a life that matters.
And the,

88
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,560
the primary principle that seemed to
flow through all of these came out of a

89
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:36,120
research project as I mentioned.
And the project started with bill to last.

90
00:05:36,121 --> 00:05:38,100
I don't know if you've ever
heard of bill to last. You know,

91
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,570
it was one of those great books,

92
00:05:39,571 --> 00:05:42,780
one of the many books that was a
bestseller and half of it was true.

93
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,350
And I had the opportunity to be a part
of the research team at Stanford that was

94
00:05:46,351 --> 00:05:46,951
working on this,

95
00:05:46,951 --> 00:05:50,400
but part of that slave labor that was
doing all of the conjoint analysis and

96
00:05:50,401 --> 00:05:54,300
Jerry when it Wharton joined us,
Howard Moskowitz at Harvard,

97
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,370
Benita Thompson led the research.
She's a behavioral psychologist.

98
00:05:58,371 --> 00:06:03,260
We work with Jim Collins and we then
went on a survey of people who we thought

99
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:05,420
had an impact for 20 years or more.
In other words,

100
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:09,350
the cohort that we went after were not
people who are one hit wonders or short

101
00:06:09,351 --> 00:06:10,340
term success stories.

102
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:14,150
We're talking about people who had
impact for at least two decades.

103
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:18,380
These were people who had been living
a life that matters and they might be

104
00:06:18,381 --> 00:06:21,260
celebrities, they might
not be. Many of them were.

105
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:23,690
I did have a very eclectic experience.

106
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,990
It started with Nelson Mandela had
the opportunity to meet Maya Angelou.

107
00:06:26,991 --> 00:06:28,460
I did many programs with her.

108
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:33,670
The Dalai Lama met the famous Googlers
and the folks at Microsoft from the very

109
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:34,221
early days.

110
00:06:34,221 --> 00:06:38,450
That just shows how you know this is going
back to 1998 when when Larry bought a

111
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,310
youtube and was talking about that at the,

112
00:06:40,311 --> 00:06:45,311
at the forum and into the present day
and the adventure ended up finding these

113
00:06:45,591 --> 00:06:46,281
criteria,

114
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:51,281
36 criteria in 2000 interviews that
we did and then we did a survey in 110

115
00:06:52,701 --> 00:06:57,701
nations to try to force rank what were
these criteria on the definition of

116
00:06:57,981 --> 00:07:02,690
success and what we found was that one
of the great core competencies of people

117
00:07:02,691 --> 00:07:07,691
like yourself who have achieved is that
you start to work at putting your demons

118
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:12,410
in a place where you can perhaps
harvest the energy from them.

119
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:17,620
That it's a bit about mastering fear
and ambition and let me share with you a

120
00:07:17,631 --> 00:07:18,830
little bit what I mean about that.

121
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:24,440
What we found was that people who have
been able to find a connection with a

122
00:07:24,441 --> 00:07:27,590
life that matters tend
to be great at failure.

123
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:33,430
Winners lose often and they lose more
often than losers because losers are

124
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:38,570
usually trying to avoid the risk
of making mistakes that winners,

125
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:43,780
people who have impact year in and year
at are usually experts at learning,

126
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:49,370
at iteration, at being able to
profit from failure and from change.

127
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,450
And I don't know about you guys,

128
00:07:50,451 --> 00:07:53,030
I've kind of often feel
this way in all of my work.

129
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:57,110
I always have way too much more to
do than I possibly can and short it.

130
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,350
Short cuts kind of never
apply when we do this.

131
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:03,020
So here's the first principle at work.

132
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,160
We found that anyone who had really swung
for the fences in high achievement had

133
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:12,161
also failed big time and they were experts
at trying to harvest their failures.

134
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:17,480
Let me give you just one exercise that
we can all apply in how we would rethink

135
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:20,750
any sort of disaster that we've
ever been in. So Richard Branson,

136
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:23,420
who was one of the early
sponsors of this book,

137
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,790
had a tragedy occur where he had been
collecting 30 years of his notes in the

138
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:32,870
family home on Necker island.
And it burned down four
years ago. Quite famously,

139
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,090
a bolt of lightning came through the roof.

140
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:40,130
He had been sleeping on the beach and
the house was filled with people and his

141
00:08:40,131 --> 00:08:44,030
90 year old bum eve was able to escort
actually everybody out of the house when

142
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:47,890
this big explosion occurred and she's
still bragging about it to this day,

143
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:52,340
eve is, and he said, I learned
something really profound that day.

144
00:08:52,341 --> 00:08:54,710
Obviously I was really worried
about people being hurt,

145
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,830
but then I realized how helpless I was in
that disaster. I was down on the beach,

146
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,210
he was starting to run to do the rescue
and he realized he wasn't fully clothed,

147
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,940
he was barefoot.
He ran straight into a cactus.

148
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:10,320
It wasn't a pleasant experience for him
and he realized something that informed

149
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:15,330
30 years of his work that had gone up in
smoke and that is that if you did want

150
00:09:15,331 --> 00:09:19,170
to restart a life or a
career or a business,

151
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,090
do you think you would do that in
exactly the same blueprint that you had

152
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,970
leading up to that point of disaster?
In other words,

153
00:09:26,971 --> 00:09:31,200
one of the greatest ways to think about
looking forward in your life is to

154
00:09:31,201 --> 00:09:32,940
restart the old life.
In other words,

155
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,470
would you have the same blueprint
for that House that you rebuild?

156
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,370
Would you have that same work plan
for your career or would you do things

157
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:42,090
differently?

158
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:46,950
Would you think about every aspect or
process of your work or career in the same

159
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:47,400
way?

160
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,690
I don't think so that one of the best
ways we can think about our goal setting

161
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:54,600
every year as it is to say, what if I
were to start over? What would I do here?

162
00:09:54,601 --> 00:09:55,230
Friendly?

163
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,700
How can I avoid just paving
the cow path as they say?

164
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,810
Would it be the same team?

165
00:10:00,811 --> 00:10:04,830
Whereas really truly the value
creation in our life and work.

166
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:05,821
Think about that.

167
00:10:05,821 --> 00:10:09,300
Restart when you're doing your goal
setting rather than just thinking about

168
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:12,030
incrementing yourself into the
next thing you work on. Now,

169
00:10:12,031 --> 00:10:14,220
I'm going to give you some
more tools to unpack this,

170
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,130
but I wanted to start there because
a lot of the work that we do,

171
00:10:17,131 --> 00:10:20,970
and it's a lot of the effort that we put
into the work that we do ends up being

172
00:10:20,971 --> 00:10:21,804
through inertia,

173
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:27,180
and I hate this quote with Edison
talking about failure. You know,

174
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,750
10,000 ways that it didn't work,
but the truth of the matter is that when,

175
00:10:31,751 --> 00:10:36,520
when we make effort and we are feeling
like we're having a setback or re

176
00:10:36,521 --> 00:10:37,830
humiliated from that effort,

177
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:42,810
the the truth of the matter is that the
people who are continuing to have impact

178
00:10:42,811 --> 00:10:46,500
continue to do that and learn from that
experience rather than allow themselves

179
00:10:46,501 --> 00:10:51,180
to be weighed under the pressures of it,
that that whenever he gets criticized,

180
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,690
he thinks about the experience
he has like this virgin,

181
00:10:54,691 --> 00:10:55,950
we have more experience in our,

182
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:00,870
Our name would suggest
that it's about iteration.

183
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:04,000
It's about the capacity to be
able to fail and move on this.

184
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:08,160
That's the second principle that we
learned from this group of high achievers

185
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,370
like yourself was that is
there anyone in this room has,

186
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,730
who's ever wanted to do
something important in their
life or work where others

187
00:11:14,731 --> 00:11:17,910
didn't approve of them?
Of course,

188
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:22,860
we've all had or continue to have
constantly what we call the silent scream.

189
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:28,410
What is it in your life or work that
others who love you, want to protect,

190
00:11:28,411 --> 00:11:33,210
you are trying to suppress or would hope
that you'd make something of yourself

191
00:11:33,211 --> 00:11:35,910
so that you take another
path in your life and work.

192
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:39,000
This ends up being a very
common pattern for all of us,

193
00:11:39,001 --> 00:11:40,800
and usually we tolerate it.
In fact,

194
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:44,460
we ended up fueling it because we do
the second piece of the silent scream.

195
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:45,960
The first piece ends up being,

196
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:50,490
we're allowing others to perhaps deny
that part of our life that we care about.

197
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,770
And then secondly, we will
often hide that passion. Well,

198
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,510
that's kind of our secret.

199
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,840
It's what we don't want other people
to trash because it's something that we

200
00:11:58,841 --> 00:12:00,640
love and something that we treasure.

201
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,530
And then the irony of all
this is that quite frankly,

202
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,180
people who love you can see right through
the ceiling like silent scream, right?

203
00:12:10,181 --> 00:12:15,181
The truth of the matter is it oozes out
around all the edges that when we do

204
00:12:15,311 --> 00:12:17,380
coaching with high
achievers like yourself,

205
00:12:17,381 --> 00:12:22,330
we find all the time that there's that
silent scream that's worth being aware of.

206
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:27,070
It's worth trying to build a plan
of safety around that silent scream.

207
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:31,780
We're going to talk more about how to
develop a safe way to pursue your silent

208
00:12:31,781 --> 00:12:35,830
scream, but here's a glimpse at how
we found this cohort around the world.

209
00:12:35,831 --> 00:12:37,870
In 110 nations started to deal with this.

210
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:42,040
We didn't find any person who is
doing something extraordinarily well,

211
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,170
who didn't have a portfolio passions.

212
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:48,760
There isn't just one thing to do with
our lives that usually there was a main

213
00:12:48,761 --> 00:12:51,040
expertise that was driven by an obsession,

214
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,950
but there was always a
portfolio of passions,

215
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:58,450
other parts of that silent scream
that you tap that feeds you,

216
00:12:58,451 --> 00:13:02,350
that restore you, that allow
you to recover, that allow
you to become resilient,

217
00:13:02,351 --> 00:13:06,250
that allow you to in a sense create a
more rich and full life that matters.

218
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,600
There's an obsession,

219
00:13:07,601 --> 00:13:12,340
I think now with expertise and being very
precise about just what one area that

220
00:13:12,341 --> 00:13:16,810
we focus on and what we found is that
people who've had endearing lives of

221
00:13:16,811 --> 00:13:21,460
creativity and contribution have a silent
scream that contributes to a portfolio

222
00:13:21,461 --> 00:13:22,870
of passions and it's about,

223
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:27,520
it's about putting a spotlight on
what those are for you and your life.

224
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:32,080
The third area that I found a bit
ironic is that that people who are high

225
00:13:32,081 --> 00:13:37,081
achieving have a paradoxical
pumpkin combination of both
Hubris and humility and

226
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:40,630
other was Hubris. You have to have
people like my friend Gail Devers,

227
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,730
she went to four Olympics.
Now,

228
00:13:42,731 --> 00:13:47,230
this woman on the fourth Olympic got a
gold medal and she lamented the fact that

229
00:13:47,231 --> 00:13:51,340
she hadn't broken the world
record said seriously gale,

230
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:55,870
I mean four Olympics. And what we
found was that on the one hand,

231
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:00,900
she has this enormous Hubris to believe
that she can do so well at something and

232
00:14:01,121 --> 00:14:04,810
the humility to realize that I always
want to get better and that nothing that I

233
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:08,320
achieved can't be done without.
And through the efforts of others,

234
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:13,060
that it's a combination of Hubris and
humility that drives people to have high

235
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:14,190
impact.
Uh,

236
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,860
we talked to Sally fields early on
in the interviews that we were doing.

237
00:14:17,861 --> 00:14:21,270
She's one of the few women who've worked
for 40 years on stage and screen Emmy

238
00:14:21,271 --> 00:14:25,090
and an academy award winning actress
started out in meaningless roles,

239
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:28,930
ended up doing very meaningful
high contribution work.

240
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,760
Listen to how she describes her journey.

241
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:34,380
The only thing that you have power
over is to get good at what you do.

242
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:38,820
That's all there is. That's all there is.
There ain't no more. And the only time,

243
00:14:38,821 --> 00:14:41,960
the only way you become a
leader or any such, you know,

244
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,440
highfalutin terminology, a role
model and leader, uh, you know,

245
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:49,020
give back is to have something to
give back. You see, the only reason,

246
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:51,740
the only way you have something to
give back, it's go do something,

247
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,630
get off your rear end and go do something.
And that doesn't mean I'm going to go,

248
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:01,550
you know,
build a housing for the underprivileged.

249
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,820
That's good too. But go
become a doctor, a lawyer,

250
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:08,210
an Indian chief goal and worked your tail
off and achieve something for yourself.

251
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,400
Some specific thing,

252
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:13,370
but be excellent at what that is.

253
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:18,610
That's the only way that you can be a
leader who wakes up one day and says,

254
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:23,390
hmm, should I go to school or
shall I be a leader? Let's see,

255
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:26,720
what shall I do today?
I think I'm going to go out and lead it.

256
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:33,130
It's a non thing as a non thing that
happens by accident after you've pursued

257
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:40,601
and struggled and kicked yourself around
the block 400 gazillion times and one

258
00:15:41,961 --> 00:15:43,670
day you look at and you
say, okay, I've done that.

259
00:15:43,671 --> 00:15:46,880
I've done that and people are turning
to you and saying, lead us. You know?

260
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,273
Huh.

261
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:51,970
On more than one occasion,

262
00:15:51,971 --> 00:15:56,140
I was delighted to have been really put
in my place when I ask questions like,

263
00:15:56,141 --> 00:15:59,260
so how did you find that leadership
journey as a woman on Hollywood?

264
00:15:59,261 --> 00:16:03,730
And she said, are you nuts? That's not
how we go about a journey that matters.

265
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:05,740
It's not about you.

266
00:16:05,741 --> 00:16:10,540
It's about each of us individually
finding that silent scream and reaching in

267
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:15,541
and having the humility and the Hubris
to make choices about moving towards that

268
00:16:16,211 --> 00:16:20,350
mission. And if it's ever not
a struggle, then good for you.

269
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:24,460
But what the people who are feeling,
they're silent, scream, feeding them.

270
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:29,350
And so being a very powerful combination
of Hubris and humility. I think about,

271
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:32,380
I met Steve Jobs in high school.
I was a freshman, he was a senior.

272
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:37,000
There was a summer at homestead high
school where we met each other in a place,

273
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,790
well, I shouldn't even tell you, but I
was in the principal's office with him

274
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:46,060
and I will tell you why we were there so
long or had such an opportunity to bond.

275
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,960
But I will tell you that
it was interesting to,

276
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:53,020
to hear him talk about his dreams and
at that time where I was in my life,

277
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,910
all that was was frightening to me.

278
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:59,140
To hear his hubris and his sense
of ambition and creativity.

279
00:16:59,141 --> 00:17:00,670
There's no way I was going to chase him.

280
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,250
This is not a story of me spending time
in that garage and becoming a business

281
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,920
building and there was no way I could
possibly surrender at that point to the

282
00:17:08,921 --> 00:17:13,000
seduction of what he already had, which
was clarity about that silent scream.

283
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:18,400
Later, I would have the privilege of
meeting him as Steve To oh, because I,

284
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,810
at that point in my career,

285
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:25,340
and by 1999 I was chairman of a company
that invented this little thing. Um,

286
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:30,220
anyone know what that is? Yeah. An MP.
Three player. Right, exactly. Like what?

287
00:17:30,221 --> 00:17:34,000
I'm very proud of the fact that while
other technology has all turned over in

288
00:17:34,001 --> 00:17:37,270
the last 25 years, nobody would think
that was still be on your device.

289
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:40,450
But it's on pretty much everybody's
device today. Still the MP three player,

290
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,920
the audio is chairman of that.

291
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:46,970
The little startup company and it was
giving a speech at Stanford and Steve Jobs

292
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:52,170
was going through his resurrection and
he came up to the front. He said, mark,

293
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:52,890
you're an idiot.

294
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:56,490
This is a geeky piece of crap and we're
going to crush it in about two years.

295
00:17:56,491 --> 00:18:01,020
You want to come work for
me? What a recruiting this
is. This was Steve to Datto.

296
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,800
Don't let that attitude
ever be an excuse to,

297
00:18:04,801 --> 00:18:07,860
I don't know how many leaders tell me,
well Steve behaved that way. I said,

298
00:18:07,861 --> 00:18:12,450
well there's an outlier once we disrupt
for different industries and maybe we

299
00:18:12,451 --> 00:18:14,640
have the privilege of being
that kind of personality.

300
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,420
But even he had started to recognize
that it wasn't about him anymore.

301
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:23,100
He was going to have to recruit a players
from so many different fields and it

302
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:26,430
was always about staying hungry and
staying foolish enough that this time he

303
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:29,700
wasn't going to lose this as company
again. But it's interesting to see,

304
00:18:29,701 --> 00:18:32,310
and I say this with the grace and
love respect cause because I had an

305
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:36,190
opportunity to work with him over a
three year period, he, he'd come a lot,

306
00:18:36,191 --> 00:18:40,080
a long way as a leader. But when you
think about what was it just last week,

307
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:44,010
apple became the most valuable company
in the world, broke uh, $1 trillion.

308
00:18:44,011 --> 00:18:46,470
They had already been the most
valuable company in the world,

309
00:18:46,471 --> 00:18:50,850
but it wasn't until 2011 in his passing
that the company went on to become the

310
00:18:50,851 --> 00:18:52,200
most valuable in the world.

311
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:57,210
And it was interesting
how he is transformation
certainly contributed to the

312
00:18:57,211 --> 00:19:00,480
inertia in that company, but he didn't
turn all of his wounds into wisdom.

313
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:05,570
This guy did chuck Schwab
being fiercely independent,

314
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,350
having this Hubris,

315
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:11,040
but then also being set
by back by dyslexia.

316
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:12,870
When I met him,

317
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:16,950
he talked about how there was no way
that he could have built a company if it

318
00:19:16,951 --> 00:19:20,790
hadn't been by finding people who
had the strengths that he lacked.

319
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,410
And it turns out at
Stanford Business School,

320
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:26,340
he ended up being one of the people who
most quickly scaled a business out of

321
00:19:26,341 --> 00:19:28,860
business school because he never thought
he was the smartest guy in the room.

322
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:35,070
He always chose to recruit a team around
him that could do the things that he

323
00:19:35,071 --> 00:19:39,180
couldn't. He put his life's
work, his silent scream,

324
00:19:39,181 --> 00:19:40,350
turned it into passions,

325
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:44,820
and then instantly recruited a team to
that dream who else could contribute to

326
00:19:44,821 --> 00:19:49,230
that dream and those sets of passions in
ways that they owned and ways that they

327
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:52,860
could make a unique contribution
of their own independent impact.

328
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:56,010
Listen to how chuck talks about this.
This is another piece of archival.

329
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:59,360
How'd you go about coping when you were,
you went on to college and,

330
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:02,500
and started your career?
How did it all through college?

331
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,210
I got to call eyes by
the, uh, you know, uh,

332
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:11,010
by a lot of luck and uh, sometimes
I think even mirrors, uh,

333
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:15,150
because I flunked English a a
couple of times at Stanford and a,

334
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,350
it was a very debilitating,

335
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:22,410
depressing thing for me to do that cause
I was thought it was pretty bright and

336
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,040
I didn't realize how incompetent
I was in the skill of writing.

337
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:29,710
In some respects.

338
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:34,240
The positive side of this learning issue
thing was probably my early recognition

339
00:20:34,241 --> 00:20:38,670
that I wasn't strong in every,
every component of, uh, of,

340
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:40,990
you know, reading, writing,

341
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:44,500
all those kinds of things that I needed
to have other people who could help me

342
00:20:44,501 --> 00:20:47,890
out in different parts of the
business that it was developing.

343
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:52,630
A lot of people who are brilliant, we'll
say, and who are brilliant entrepreneurs,

344
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:57,460
think they can do everything and they
don't develop the team that they need to

345
00:20:57,461 --> 00:21:00,670
have in order to accomplish that various
levels that you're going to reach in

346
00:21:00,671 --> 00:21:02,920
your growth curve as a successful company.

347
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:07,810
And so at every level this Schwab has
moved to. I've been able to, I think,

348
00:21:07,811 --> 00:21:12,811
recognize my strengths and my deficits
and build up around me with great people

349
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,930
in the deficit area.

350
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:22,530
And I think that probably has been maybe
the one single most important benefit

351
00:21:22,931 --> 00:21:25,600
that I achieved or received from uh,

352
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:29,300
having this learning issue
early on in my life. Uh,

353
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,510
so it's a little perverse
in some respects,

354
00:21:31,511 --> 00:21:34,450
but at least that's the
way I rationalize it.

355
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:37,900
Best bosses I ever had spent
12 years working at his side,

356
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,020
really informed the way I decide now.

357
00:21:41,021 --> 00:21:45,130
Whenever I think about what I want
to do next, I always think about who

358
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,760
don't. Just think what think, who.

359
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:52,810
Think about the community of
people who might share that value,

360
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,340
might be able to contribute to it in
ways that would be profound for them as

361
00:21:57,341 --> 00:22:00,040
well in their own unique characteristics.

362
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:03,280
This works as well in organizations as
it does with your individual passions.

363
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:08,260
Always recruit a team to
that dream that you have.

364
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:11,620
And he did this in a such a
beautiful way and with dyslexia. Now,

365
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:15,040
here's one of the leaders who was
really changing the way we think about

366
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,890
learning. He's got a wonderful
foundation called all kinds of mines,

367
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:21,820
finding geniuses everywhere with every
type of learning that's out there.

368
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:24,640
I suffered a disability early in my life.

369
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,030
An eyesight disability would
read it profoundly difficult
for me to read even up

370
00:22:28,031 --> 00:22:28,900
until middle school.

371
00:22:28,901 --> 00:22:32,230
So whenever I'm introduced as a New
York Times bestselling author, author,

372
00:22:32,231 --> 00:22:35,230
I always kind of go, you're
talking about me, David. Um,

373
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,470
because that was always my struggle.
I could tell stories as well.

374
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:42,610
But that eyesight issue made it
difficult with motor skills and certain

375
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:45,660
cognitive processes until I
got through adolescence and I,

376
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:48,730
and it was one of the things that called
me to the work that I do today in terms

377
00:22:48,731 --> 00:22:49,780
of executive coaching,

378
00:22:49,781 --> 00:22:53,530
because I always felt that everyone
had their own form of genius,

379
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:57,640
that maybe there are a and B players. But
truthfully, it's more about a alignment,

380
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:01,360
finding the things that we were profoundly
gifted at and be able to contribute

381
00:23:01,361 --> 00:23:05,860
that with other people around us.
Turning your wounds into wisdom.

382
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,360
Principle number five, that's
important. And I'd love for you to,

383
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,860
to ask yourself this
question if you could today,

384
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:16,360
the people who have life life's
filled with happiness and joy,

385
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:21,630
people who have lives that are filled
with meaning take a moment each day or

386
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:26,080
each week and shine a spotlight on
who and what in their life and work is

387
00:23:26,081 --> 00:23:26,914
working.

388
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:31,390
And one of the takeaways I'd love for
you to do when you leave here today is to

389
00:23:31,391 --> 00:23:35,500
think of somebody to think I've got Karen
May hear people development at Google

390
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:39,370
who's encouraged me to do this work and
and encouraged me to go around the world

391
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,920
with Googlers to think about this.
I have,

392
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:44,500
David is a dear friend now who's
developed these last couple of years.

393
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:45,530
You'll be getting a note.

394
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:49,070
I still have every note that Chuck
Schwab and Steve Jobs ever wrote me.

395
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,390
I'll never throw that away.

396
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:54,720
Just think about the last night that
you wrote to somebody, right? One,

397
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:55,970
send that email.

398
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:59,390
It doesn't take that much effort to
thank someone and it makes a profound

399
00:23:59,391 --> 00:24:02,870
difference and cognitively and
emotionally and how it touches you.

400
00:24:02,871 --> 00:24:05,330
Some people call that gratitude,
but that sounds Corny to me.

401
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:08,150
I'm really talking about who
and what works in your life.

402
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:10,430
It was really a Richard Branson who's,

403
00:24:10,431 --> 00:24:14,390
who's continued to support this work
for my coauthor Bonita Thompson and my

404
00:24:14,391 --> 00:24:16,910
daughter who's kind of
a half Gugler. Uh, the,

405
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:21,410
the work that she did at an internship
here at 18 changed her life.

406
00:24:21,411 --> 00:24:24,740
I want to thank you guys at Google for
having such a profound impact on my

407
00:24:24,741 --> 00:24:26,960
daughter because she's now a stem major.

408
00:24:26,961 --> 00:24:29,060
She went from being a
political science major,

409
00:24:29,061 --> 00:24:33,890
which she was planning to go to school
and she's now Berkeley math and she's

410
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:36,020
pursuing a Haas a degree next.

411
00:24:36,021 --> 00:24:39,200
So thank you for the contribution
you made to her life.

412
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:43,220
See how good that feels to be able
to say something like that. The,

413
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,520
the principle of having a place that's
safe to tinker came up over and over

414
00:24:48,531 --> 00:24:52,640
again. It all 110 nations, no matter
who we talked to as achievers,

415
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,590
there was always a safe
place for a garage.

416
00:24:54,591 --> 00:24:57,320
And I called this in a garage because
if you think about silicon valley were

417
00:24:57,321 --> 00:25:00,230
filled with garages, which don't
have cars. I don't know about you,

418
00:25:00,231 --> 00:25:04,100
but when I was growing up, I never
visited a garage that had a car in it.

419
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:07,970
What would you, what would you put a
car? Unless you're inventing a car,

420
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,560
why would you put a car in a garage?

421
00:25:09,561 --> 00:25:14,030
This was a safe place to tinker and create
a new dream or build something or do

422
00:25:14,031 --> 00:25:17,180
that craft project. And you know, if it
wasn't good enough to show the world,

423
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:21,080
nobody can get to know.
It wasn't good enough to leave the garage.

424
00:25:21,081 --> 00:25:25,050
It didn't leave the garage. And so what's
interesting in organizations and in,

425
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:28,280
in the businesses that I've helped
build and in the lives that I've helped

426
00:25:28,281 --> 00:25:32,030
support, you need a place to tinker.
Where's your garage? It's amazing.

427
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:34,670
Just across the bay at Pixar,
I work with Jim Morris over there.

428
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:39,110
It's amazing to see how they have safe
places to tinker on massively expensive

429
00:25:39,111 --> 00:25:43,100
creative projects like films at Pixar is,
you know, if you read Ed Catmull's book,

430
00:25:43,101 --> 00:25:46,400
I think one of the very best leadership
books around and thinking about creating

431
00:25:46,401 --> 00:25:50,840
a life that matters is to read creativity
inc because he talks about that place

432
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:53,090
where you brainstorm and
it's completely safe.

433
00:25:53,091 --> 00:25:56,720
This is a brainstorming room and
you never criticize anybody eyes,

434
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:01,610
anybody's ideas in that brainstorming
room, you plus it up, you add to it.

435
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,560
If you're going to be critical,
you're out of there.

436
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:06,770
You've got to be able to
build on pylon in a new way.

437
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:10,730
So where is your community of or your
mastermind for the dream that you want to

438
00:26:10,731 --> 00:26:11,330
follow?

439
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:15,440
Is there a safe place to do that and have
people come and pile on ideas and then

440
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:17,870
it, at least at Pixar, they realize
they have to run a business.

441
00:26:17,871 --> 00:26:20,300
So then they take it to
another room to say, okay,

442
00:26:20,301 --> 00:26:23,840
now we're going to deconstruct the
crime here. Set priorities, which are,

443
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:26,390
that's miserable. I hate
setting priorities. You know,

444
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:30,470
no entrepreneur wants to decide which
goes in which stays and what's done now

445
00:26:30,471 --> 00:26:31,520
and what's done next.

446
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,190
And then they have a third room
where they operationalize things.

447
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:38,540
That's the business school that has to
be practiced in order to run a business.

448
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:42,290
So try to think about a sense of place.
We're all as humans,

449
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:46,530
the environment does when we do this
at Google in terms of having creative

450
00:26:46,531 --> 00:26:47,790
spaces.
But remember,

451
00:26:47,791 --> 00:26:51,210
if you can have a place that you
designate that's safe to create,

452
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:55,890
safe to incubate, and safe to
deliver, that's really important.

453
00:26:55,891 --> 00:26:57,630
We've found it coming
up over and over again.

454
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:01,050
Another principle that we found in,

455
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,750
in this cohort of the high
achievers was that they,

456
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:06,660
like we talked earlier
about the silent scream.

457
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:10,680
Anyone here have a secret
fear that they've run across?

458
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:14,820
We all have different phobias and
fears that we've had to face. Um,

459
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:19,060
can I give you a stupid one for me?
Uh, and I guess it's pretty safe to,

460
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:22,020
to tell this crowd about just being,
having a,

461
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,320
a fear of heights and roller
coasters. I still, even to this day,

462
00:27:25,321 --> 00:27:28,170
never been on a rollercoaster and
not have any consequences at least,

463
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,030
and this was hard when I became a daddy,

464
00:27:30,031 --> 00:27:33,270
because I would walk my daughter to the
matter horn at Disney and I hear the

465
00:27:33,271 --> 00:27:35,850
screams of delight and I heard
her screams of the light. She,

466
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,820
she looked like this little one here
and we'd walk closer and closer,

467
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,440
the melting down pat feeling
my hands getting sweaty and,

468
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:47,850
and by the time we got just up to deliver
her and put her on the ride, I'd say,

469
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,610
Daddy's got to take a call.
Mommy's gonna ride with you.

470
00:27:50,611 --> 00:27:52,050
And that's what we do every time.
You know,

471
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:55,560
it was just like she saw it through that.
She shot through that very quickly.

472
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:56,881
Well,

473
00:27:56,881 --> 00:27:59,830
one of the things that I'm embarrassed
to say that I didn't really discover it

474
00:27:59,831 --> 00:28:04,350
until this year and understanding in this
data that I've been collecting for 20

475
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:09,330
years, and it was around this idea that
often people who are high achievers,

476
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:11,280
they may or may not face a fear down,

477
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:16,710
but they almost never think about it
as being a potential source of joy.

478
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,840
If we could prepare for it,

479
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:22,470
what if there was some way that we could
somehow prepare for this difficulty in

480
00:28:22,471 --> 00:28:26,520
our life in a way that there just might
be some shred of joy that comes from it.

481
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:30,570
That might to be an unlocked for me and
there ended up being one for me in this

482
00:28:30,571 --> 00:28:34,770
particular case. I decided that yes.
Okay. I was going to be ambitious here.

483
00:28:34,771 --> 00:28:36,750
I was going to toughen up.
I was going to face,

484
00:28:36,751 --> 00:28:39,600
my fear is going to take a
group of, of my clients, uh,

485
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:43,500
it was the founder of Pinterest,
the CEO of of HP and the staff.

486
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:48,530
We rented a zero g plane and we went up
in the so called vomit comments and what

487
00:28:49,081 --> 00:28:54,081
they do is they rent 10 miles by 100
miles of the stratosphere and they do 15

488
00:28:55,021 --> 00:28:59,910
parabolas and you know down you're doing
three g's and up. You're doing well,

489
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:04,410
zero g and I, it was some macho
thing in me that said, oh,

490
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:05,880
I just have to do this, you know, for,

491
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:09,930
forget the roller coasters
are the skydiving. I'm going
to prepare for this now.

492
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:11,970
I'm 20 years older than
everybody who's on the plane.

493
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:15,240
So I trained rigorously for this.
I started studying.

494
00:29:15,241 --> 00:29:18,570
Why is it that you get nauseous, mark?
Why do you get Vertigo? It's interesting.

495
00:29:18,571 --> 00:29:22,650
I'd never leaned into my fear.
I'd never studied how was,

496
00:29:22,651 --> 00:29:26,250
what do we know about people who have
fear of heights? Why do I have this fear?

497
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:29,490
How could I address this fear?
I guess I could go to therapy,

498
00:29:29,491 --> 00:29:32,880
but then that was be just a cycle.
I wasn't really coaching myself.

499
00:29:32,881 --> 00:29:37,620
I wasn't a very good student.
So I s I deconstructed this fear.

500
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:40,770
Now I'm not saying I conquered it.
I don't think that's true.

501
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,850
I think what you do is
you actually manage it,

502
00:29:42,851 --> 00:29:44,920
but I never thought
that I might harvest it.

503
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:48,550
So I ended up going up in the
vomit comet because you know,

504
00:29:48,551 --> 00:29:51,490
and I was thinking this all along, it was
thinking about the roller coaster ride.

505
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,650
I'm not going to be like
Ryan was in that movie,

506
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:57,070
but I was going to try to
find a way to go into zero g.

507
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,980
Well that was fun.
I would do that every day of the week.

508
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:17,480
Something that apps that was,
that was doing something.

509
00:30:17,481 --> 00:30:21,500
I can't imagine anything more frightening
than to deal with looking out into the

510
00:30:21,501 --> 00:30:24,680
stratosphere and looking from dark
to light and plunging like that.

511
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:26,610
I stayed on the course.
I,

512
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:29,420
I stayed very disciplined
about what they asked me to do,

513
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:32,450
but I never expected to enjoy it.

514
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:33,810
Okay.

515
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:38,810
What fears do we have in our life that
are holding us back that there might be

516
00:30:39,001 --> 00:30:44,001
just the shred of an unlock that we are
worthy of leaning into and learning more

517
00:30:44,281 --> 00:30:44,610
about?

518
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:47,430
That's something I'd never thought I
would explore for myself before and I,

519
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:48,690
I would see it.

520
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:53,690
I observed it and I've been hearing
people tell me this for 20 years and never

521
00:30:53,701 --> 00:30:56,670
internalized it until this year
or found a way to exercise it.

522
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:58,830
You learn throughout life.

523
00:30:58,831 --> 00:31:03,831
I'm hitting my 60th birthday here and
finding a new joy that I missed that last

524
00:31:04,141 --> 00:31:06,420
60 years.
Now I'm feeling greedy.

525
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,480
What else have I missed about what makes
life special and what makes life so

526
00:31:11,641 --> 00:31:12,720
rich and creative?

527
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,620
And this is what is unique about this
cohort of people that I've found who

528
00:31:16,621 --> 00:31:20,610
continued to reevaluate how to create a
life that matters and look at success.

529
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:24,480
So let's deconstruct that one level
further here. In the final piece,

530
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,010
I want to ask you folks,

531
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:29,700
if a loved one came to you not knowing
anything about what you do for a living

532
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:34,950
but their loved ones, it could be
a child or a parent and asked you,

533
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:38,910
what's your definition of success?
What would, what would you tell them?

534
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,240
Just at the highest level, what would be
your definition of success? Anyone here?

535
00:31:42,241 --> 00:31:46,260
There's no right answer anyway. David,

536
00:31:46,261 --> 00:31:47,850
what would be your definition of success?

537
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,550
I Love, love me and are better
human beings because of that.

538
00:31:57,270 --> 00:32:00,030
Is that a lovely definition of success?
Give him a round of applause.

539
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:03,030
That's beautiful.
That's beautiful.

540
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:07,500
That the community that I care about is
better off because we're together and

541
00:32:07,501 --> 00:32:09,420
that you contributed to that community.
Anyone else?

542
00:32:09,421 --> 00:32:11,640
What would be another
definition of success? Yes.

543
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,333
Fulfillment

544
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:23,410
and being able to do some of those
passions that maybe we talked about.

545
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:26,050
Maybe if you were a silent screams,
give him a round of applause.

546
00:32:26,051 --> 00:32:30,310
That's a great definition that you could
find another part of your life that you

547
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:32,860
yes.
Happiness.

548
00:32:32,861 --> 00:32:36,460
What a concept that to come with success
and that we'd be dividends of both of

549
00:32:36,461 --> 00:32:39,530
these others. That's a great to give
her a round of applause. Success.

550
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,340
Any other definitions of success?

551
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,633
Okay.

552
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:49,670
Anything else that comes
to mind? She dropped. She,

553
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:52,150
she was doing her hair back there.
So you won the bid.

554
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:53,290
What would be your definition?

555
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:57,640
Um, well it's not my definition,
but a definition associated with

556
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:00,683
pain.

557
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:05,040
Yes, exactly. So this is an
interesting point that will make,

558
00:33:05,041 --> 00:33:09,690
so if you looked up the definition
of success in the dictionary,

559
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,720
which actually didn't occur to me to
do 20 years ago when we started the

560
00:33:12,721 --> 00:33:17,160
research, but our warden
team said like, if you could,

561
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,380
we're going to publish this book
with Prentice Hall. You know,

562
00:33:19,381 --> 00:33:22,080
we got to do the research,
look in the dictionary.

563
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,800
That was the definition in the dictionary.
But that's it.

564
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:31,140
The definition that we heard from people
who had high impact in their lives and

565
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:36,380
had developed lives that truly matter
for them and others didn't have wealth,

566
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:39,570
fame or goals actually on the list.

567
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:42,870
So what we teach our kids
or feel conflicted about,

568
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:47,730
one of the reasons the silent screen is
so profound is because we have a double

569
00:33:47,731 --> 00:33:50,970
standard on how we define success
in every language. By the way,

570
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,250
if you can find another one,
I'll send you a nice bonus.

571
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,000
If you can find a way that deaf,

572
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:57,060
the definition of success is
to find anywhere else. It's,

573
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,300
it's a punishing evil
definition of success, frankly,

574
00:34:00,301 --> 00:34:05,010
because it's not how successful people
who've had lives that matter long periods

575
00:34:05,011 --> 00:34:08,370
of time define success. In
fact, the definition of success,

576
00:34:08,371 --> 00:34:10,860
I shouldn't be surprised.
And I hear this, a Google,

577
00:34:10,861 --> 00:34:13,830
wherever I go in the world and
I'm now asking people live in,

578
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:19,110
in meetings like this, 10 15,000 people,
they define success, the success,

579
00:34:19,111 --> 00:34:20,700
the same way that you did in this room.

580
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:23,520
And it ends up being characterized
this way. And the and,

581
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:27,030
and the thing I want to say about
this is also for you to notice.

582
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:31,410
You should never assume that you know
somebody's definition of success.

583
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:33,510
There's more than one definition.

584
00:34:33,511 --> 00:34:37,170
I'm not sure that your definition of
success might have been the same even five

585
00:34:37,171 --> 00:34:41,520
years ago. The check in to find out what
a person's definition of success is.

586
00:34:41,521 --> 00:34:45,270
You might be profoundly
touched by how they frame it.

587
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:49,680
If knowing that about David or knowing
that about how you sense this connection

588
00:34:49,681 --> 00:34:52,950
with your passions makes a difference
in your relationship with that person.

589
00:34:52,951 --> 00:34:55,830
How they define that success.
There's not just waited one to do it.

590
00:34:56,220 --> 00:35:00,780
What we found was that there's three
categories of the definition of success.

591
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:04,380
All three of these were present in
everyone who'd had impact for 20 years or

592
00:35:04,381 --> 00:35:07,590
more.
They had a sense of a purpose or a cause,

593
00:35:07,591 --> 00:35:11,040
something that they were associated
with that was greater than themselves,

594
00:35:11,041 --> 00:35:12,960
but that they believed in,
that they cared about.

595
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:17,130
They had a sense of
passions and connection.

596
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:20,790
They had a sense of the who they wanted
to be with through their purpose,

597
00:35:20,791 --> 00:35:24,060
but also through their
hobbyists and through their
passions and through the work

598
00:35:24,061 --> 00:35:24,930
that they wanted to do.

599
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:29,100
And then they also had a a way of
actually wanting to deliver on the goods.

600
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,260
I mean it's one thing
to be purpose driven,

601
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,740
but it's hard to really earn the right
to do that unless you can deliver on some

602
00:35:34,741 --> 00:35:39,120
of your promises that if this what we'd
call the genius of the end rather than

603
00:35:39,121 --> 00:35:42,420
material, any of the your that that
when you're feeling out of balance,

604
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,390
it's not just because you can't do
enough of the one thing that you love.

605
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,990
It's because we're often not doing things
that we can see connected to something

606
00:35:48,991 --> 00:35:51,090
bigger than us or a
community bigger than us.

607
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:54,060
And that also feeds our passions.

608
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:56,670
The passions are about things
that we would do on our own.

609
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:57,900
They're not about winning.

610
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:02,200
There are about doing something we
believe in that we want to refine this.

611
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:07,080
Something that we want to be a part of
performance has to do with our ability to

612
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:08,810
deliver on those things.
And,

613
00:36:08,811 --> 00:36:13,260
and what I'd love to do right now is just
serve you a set of definitions around

614
00:36:13,261 --> 00:36:15,450
passion.
So you can mind this a little deeper.

615
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:18,780
So what we found is that there are
really six dimensions of passion.

616
00:36:18,781 --> 00:36:21,870
And the reason I have my Angela and Warren
Buffet up here is because when I went

617
00:36:21,871 --> 00:36:26,430
to visit Maya Angelo, she talked about
how most of us don't live our lives,

618
00:36:26,431 --> 00:36:28,020
feelings,
all three of these,

619
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:31,880
that it's easy to maybe focus on one
but not the other two. That wouldn't,

620
00:36:31,881 --> 00:36:35,130
we're feeling out of balance. It's
because we haven't decided, wait, okay,

621
00:36:35,131 --> 00:36:38,310
so how is this connected to something
bigger than me or longer term?

622
00:36:38,311 --> 00:36:41,040
Some people might even call
this a legacy and you know,

623
00:36:41,041 --> 00:36:43,280
could this could be a community,
it could, it doesn't have to.

624
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,930
It could be a company,
it could be a customer,

625
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,420
just something bigger than ourselves.
Passions are for you.

626
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,390
Performance is how we deliver an express.
All of those.

627
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,820
So let's go through purpose,
passion, and performance.

628
00:36:53,821 --> 00:36:55,170
But one thing about Warren Buffet,

629
00:36:55,171 --> 00:37:00,171
Warren Buffet won't accept a job inquiry
from an individual unless they qualify

630
00:37:00,511 --> 00:37:01,920
for all three of these.
He says,

631
00:37:01,921 --> 00:37:05,070
a lot of people will have a sense of
how they've served to a business or a

632
00:37:05,071 --> 00:37:06,090
purpose in the past.

633
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:10,410
They'll express maybe how they've
delivered in terms of performance,

634
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,240
but when it comes to passion,

635
00:37:12,241 --> 00:37:16,320
most people put that off and don't
integrate that in with their work.

636
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,850
That that passion is not something you
should put off to another time and needs

637
00:37:19,851 --> 00:37:21,690
to be a part of your everyday work.

638
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:26,580
He said that that passion to put off
your passions is a little bit like saving

639
00:37:26,581 --> 00:37:30,180
up sex for old age.
It's a really bad idea.

640
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,420
We should be living full out right now.
And I said,

641
00:37:33,421 --> 00:37:36,270
good for you wore and I want to
be that way. When I made a right,

642
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:41,750
the oracle of Omaha says that we should
be living full out and so should the Po,

643
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:45,270
the Po. So there's the Poe, the
poet, and she expresses her life.

644
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:50,100
So let's look quickly at passion.
Passion. We found this portfolio.

645
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,630
Passions. We talked about, you can,

646
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:56,010
you can look at this set of passions
in the sense that one of the ways to

647
00:37:56,011 --> 00:37:59,160
evaluate whether you're doing something
you're passionate about is that you will

648
00:37:59,161 --> 00:38:02,100
lose sense of time.
Mikael, Chez Mal, Holly,

649
00:38:02,101 --> 00:38:06,220
the social scientist would call
experts in their field where they,

650
00:38:06,221 --> 00:38:07,950
the were artists are chemists and say,

651
00:38:07,951 --> 00:38:10,500
how long have you been working on
the project? Don't look at a watch.

652
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:14,310
They could never say your
unconscious competence.

653
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:17,220
You will lose that when you're in
the flow, ever been in the flow.

654
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:20,250
You're doing something else and it
starts to contribute to answering the

655
00:38:20,251 --> 00:38:23,820
question. As soon as you let go of the
problem you're running, you're reading,

656
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:27,930
you're doing your favorite knitting,
then it starts to flow for you.

657
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,800
So think when you watch the flow,
that's usually an indication of passion.

658
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:36,010
We tend to have a bias when it comes
to defining failure. Generally,

659
00:38:36,011 --> 00:38:38,740
when you're doing something you're
passionate about, it's not a failure.

660
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:41,080
It's a learning.
We redefine it.

661
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:44,980
I used to run and play
music in high school.

662
00:38:44,981 --> 00:38:48,310
I don't run anymore because I wasn't
that good at it. So I failed at that,

663
00:38:48,311 --> 00:38:50,470
but I'm still playing the horn even
though I wasn't that good at it.

664
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:53,950
But I'm learning, I'm getting
better and better. Um, I,

665
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:55,810
I'm still trying to be creative that way.

666
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,710
We tend to be proactive and do the
things we're passionate about first.

667
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:02,260
We like to think we're objective,
but we have decision by us.

668
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:05,560
The things that get at the top of the
list are generally the ones that we feel

669
00:39:05,561 --> 00:39:06,670
the most passionate about.

670
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:10,320
I'm thinking over this because
I'm not a behavioral psychologist.

671
00:39:10,321 --> 00:39:12,460
I really wanted to look at
how the behavioral data,

672
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:16,360
what we did a forced ranking and we
asked people in this conjoint analysis to

673
00:39:16,361 --> 00:39:19,750
determine what they really cared about
this is these were the dimensions of

674
00:39:19,751 --> 00:39:23,290
passion. That passion is something
you'd secretly do for free.

675
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,720
Now I know we're at Google is a business,

676
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:28,720
but we're all hopefully driven
not just by the clock, right?

677
00:39:28,721 --> 00:39:33,520
We are driven with doing something some
aspect of the day. I mean life is short,

678
00:39:33,521 --> 00:39:35,440
but some days are very long,
right?

679
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:38,920
Not Everything we do is something
we love and it's not what I'm really

680
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:39,880
proselytizing hear.

681
00:39:39,881 --> 00:39:43,240
What I'm saying is that there needs to
be some aspect of the work we do that

682
00:39:43,241 --> 00:39:46,330
feeds us even with out
traditional compensation.

683
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:48,820
You bore people when you're passionate,

684
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:53,440
so you go to a party and you know
somebody asks me about my daughter,

685
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:56,230
please don't make this mistake.
I will not shut up.

686
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,320
You'll be looking at me saying,
I'm so happy for you, mark,

687
00:39:59,321 --> 00:40:01,750
and they're looking at their watch.
They feel the aging process.

688
00:40:01,751 --> 00:40:03,610
They don't know how to get
out of the conversation.

689
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,560
Mark is still geeking over it.

690
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:11,230
You're not politically correct or socially
conscious entirely when you're in a

691
00:40:11,231 --> 00:40:13,990
state of passion, when you're, when
you're living your passion. Now,

692
00:40:13,991 --> 00:40:18,970
this is an important way to deconstruct
relationships because it's good to know

693
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:19,781
what's flipping.

694
00:40:19,781 --> 00:40:24,070
Somebody switched so that you can either
feed that for them or help align them

695
00:40:24,071 --> 00:40:27,970
with that on a project or help associate
with them. If you share that passion,

696
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:29,590
this is another dimension of it.

697
00:40:29,591 --> 00:40:33,130
You definitely bore people when you're
passionate about something and it's also

698
00:40:33,131 --> 00:40:36,430
something that you would hope that in
history that you'd like to be remembered

699
00:40:36,431 --> 00:40:38,500
for. It usually is the
kind of thing that I, Gosh,

700
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:41,740
I'd love to say that the passions
that I've been living in,

701
00:40:41,741 --> 00:40:46,060
the purpose I'm feeling could somehow be
remembered that somehow would be a part

702
00:40:46,061 --> 00:40:50,500
of my legacy that could somehow
maybe make a difference. Um,

703
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,500
and it would be make a life worth living.

704
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:58,450
I do some that do spend some
considerable time up at Nike.

705
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,750
And what's the slogan at
Nike that's most famous,

706
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:06,220
which you'll have to have a slogan
like that. Everybody in any language,

707
00:41:06,221 --> 00:41:09,970
it always comes back, just do it in
English. Why is that so compelling?

708
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:15,390
Kind of cuts through the clutter and the
bullshit of our lives and the pressure

709
00:41:15,391 --> 00:41:18,820
and the denial that comes from other
people about what we really want to do.

710
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:22,060
We just want to do it,
but we don't want to just do anything.

711
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,610
I want to do something that matters.

712
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:27,160
I love the current positioning
that they have right now.

713
00:41:27,161 --> 00:41:29,590
They talk about trying to
find your inner athlete,

714
00:41:29,591 --> 00:41:32,200
whether you are an athlete or not,
and to play, to be remembered.

715
00:41:32,201 --> 00:41:36,290
I think what we'd all to feel is
that somehow the impact and the,

716
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,560
and the creativity and the
meaning that we found in our life

717
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:45,080
would mean that we had played in to be
remembered that we were writing our own

718
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:45,923
future.

719
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:51,120
That that would be perhaps the most
profound way to think about our lives. Um,

720
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:53,570
I'd like it all just
stand up for a moment.

721
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,540
I asked you the definition of success
and I just want to make a closing

722
00:41:58,210 --> 00:42:00,560
request of you all and then
we'll do some Q. And. A.

723
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:06,170
I asked you a moment ago
your definition of success

724
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:11,210
and you were processing this and
hoping I wasn't going to call on you.

725
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:13,910
And as you were doing that,

726
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:18,140
I'd like to now invite you to think about
the fact that the success that you've

727
00:42:18,141 --> 00:42:20,720
achieved is not entirely yours.

728
00:42:20,721 --> 00:42:23,060
It's also because there's
a contribution from others,

729
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,360
that there's other people in your life
and your work that have helped make you

730
00:42:26,361 --> 00:42:29,990
successful. Isn't that right?
It's not just about you.

731
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:33,200
So could you try to picture
in your mind for a moment,

732
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:38,230
someone in your life or work who's
somehow contributing to the success that

733
00:42:38,391 --> 00:42:41,720
you've enjoyed in your life? Can you,
can you get that picture in your mind?

734
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:46,700
If that person was trying somehow to
get through Google security and is now

735
00:42:46,701 --> 00:42:48,500
being arrested at the front door,

736
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:52,340
do you think you could make a noise so
loud to alert them all that they should

737
00:42:52,341 --> 00:42:53,810
let him,
he or she in,

738
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:58,580
do you think you could make a noise so
loud in this room that you could indicate

739
00:42:58,581 --> 00:43:01,850
how much you love this person? One, two,
three. I'm then on the count of three,

740
00:43:01,851 --> 00:43:04,240
you're going to give me a noise so loud
that you're going to have them released

741
00:43:04,241 --> 00:43:09,150
from security. One, two,
three go. Okay, very nice.

742
00:43:09,151 --> 00:43:12,540
Please sit down. That's great. That's
great. They're letting them through now.

743
00:43:12,541 --> 00:43:13,800
Could you check on that?
Yeah.

744
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:19,460
I wish I'd had somebody there at this
morning when I was trying to get in. Um,

745
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:24,840
the reason I did that is because there's
so few times in our life and work that

746
00:43:24,841 --> 00:43:28,410
we really show that level of gratitude
to the people that mean the most to us.

747
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:32,730
Would you promise me one thing that when
you leave here today that you could let

748
00:43:32,731 --> 00:43:37,140
those few people who qualified for you
at that mental list of success know that

749
00:43:37,141 --> 00:43:40,980
you gave them a shout out today? As
corny as that may be, that that'll,

750
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:43,530
that'll make your day better.
That'll make you feel profoundly better.

751
00:43:43,531 --> 00:43:47,100
And it's what the most creative high
impact people do. Thank you so much.

752
00:43:47,101 --> 00:43:48,600
I'd love to take questions.
Thank you.

753
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,350
Hi Mark. Thanks. Sure. Yeah.

754
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:00,590
There's the three p's and I feel like
certain ones come easier to me than others

755
00:44:00,591 --> 00:44:02,510
and damn straight.
Yeah.

756
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:07,010
So like getting stuff done or
performance. Yeah, sure. Yeah.

757
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:12,030
Um, does the passion and
then there's the purpose.

758
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:16,730
A purpose one. Yeah. I
can serve through it.

759
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:20,660
That's not natural.
How does it get to come to you?

760
00:44:20,661 --> 00:44:24,130
Is it really a thought process
or it's like really centering.

761
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:28,370
It comes from the heart. The, have you
heard of people struggling with that?

762
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:29,700
Yes,
absolutely.

763
00:44:29,701 --> 00:44:34,590
And I think we have reaffirm kind of
what we believe in and reevaluate that

764
00:44:34,591 --> 00:44:37,710
probably at many different points
in our life and in our career.

765
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:40,650
But what we found is that
the process that, that,

766
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:43,500
that many people go through is to try to,
to,

767
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:47,910
to get a sense of what their purpose
might be by looking at their career over

768
00:44:47,911 --> 00:44:52,050
time and seeing what are the proudest
moments that you have in your personal

769
00:44:52,051 --> 00:44:54,420
life. What were the proudest
moments that you have?

770
00:44:54,421 --> 00:44:56,940
What were the ones that give you
the most energy on reflection?

771
00:44:57,150 --> 00:44:59,610
Lay it out in a timeline.
Um,

772
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:03,990
and one of the ways that you can observe
that list is to start to deconstruct

773
00:45:03,991 --> 00:45:08,520
would be the three or five reasons in
terms of purpose of that work that you

774
00:45:08,521 --> 00:45:12,480
were doing. Frame it that way
that it gave you that response.

775
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:16,140
Let's start with what
gives you a sense of pride.

776
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:20,700
Now I'm grossly oversimplifying a much
deeper process that we can talk about,

777
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:25,110
but the idea is to say that are those
areas of your life that you're the

778
00:45:25,111 --> 00:45:27,720
proudest about kind of feeding
a sense of purpose in any way.

779
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:32,190
They may also be feeding a sense of
passion and some of the things that you'd

780
00:45:32,191 --> 00:45:33,810
just like to do for your own sake.

781
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:37,590
And it helps separate it from a moment
from achievement because usually when you

782
00:45:37,591 --> 00:45:39,420
answer those questions
of proud of most moments,

783
00:45:39,421 --> 00:45:42,060
you've probably already tick
the box for performance.

784
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:44,340
We're especially in Western society,

785
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:48,300
very much trained towards outcomes and
achievement and we are programmed for

786
00:45:48,301 --> 00:45:49,770
that.
That's part of the silent scream.

787
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:52,260
If there's something that we love
that's not achievement oriented,

788
00:45:52,261 --> 00:45:55,020
that's probably in the silent scream
category. It's one of those hard,

789
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:59,880
hard things to resurrect into your
active portfolio passions that you have.

790
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:05,720
It's very easy to define success.
Looking back, so like, uh,

791
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:06,300
I don't know,

792
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:09,190
like if laddie started out with the
mission of organizing the world's

793
00:46:09,191 --> 00:46:11,800
information, I was like a book.
It started out with you know,

794
00:46:11,801 --> 00:46:15,760
organizing with lake kind of run the world
vision is history of the past, right?

795
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:20,710
Yeah, so looking forward like how
do you define your mission or lake?

796
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:22,300
How do you know what you
are passionate about?

797
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:25,270
Because honestly I don't know what
I'm passionate about at this point.

798
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:30,170
You know it's because of a lot of inertia
that we often lose track of what we

799
00:46:30,171 --> 00:46:34,100
feel that are most most passionate about.
Which is why I would love to,

800
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:36,920
I'll I can send to you and you'll also
find in the book or if he didn't get a

801
00:46:36,921 --> 00:46:38,450
copy of the book we can send that to you.

802
00:46:38,451 --> 00:46:43,010
I'd be happy to send that free the
criteria around passion because you can

803
00:46:43,011 --> 00:46:46,580
explore some of those areas that speak
to use those areas that you find that you

804
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:49,880
are talking about a little
bit too long with a loved one.

805
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:54,230
The the category of areas where you find
yourself spending time when you're not

806
00:46:54,231 --> 00:46:57,890
working. Is there something you're
naturally being gravitated to? What?

807
00:46:57,990 --> 00:47:02,090
What are those areas that you are not
putting a spotlight on now because they're

808
00:47:02,091 --> 00:47:04,010
not achievement oriented
or outcome oriented.

809
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:07,010
Is there anything that you particularly
look forward to in the work that you're

810
00:47:07,011 --> 00:47:10,790
doing right now?
What aspect of it do you hate?

811
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:13,460
What aspect do you love about that?

812
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:17,000
I often go through a process where it's
more interesting to look at what you

813
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:21,050
hate and see why you hate it and
you think that's a really dumb idea.

814
00:47:21,051 --> 00:47:25,100
Why would we look at the things that we
consider a failure and hate the most?

815
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:28,310
Because what's shocking is if you
share that with three other people,

816
00:47:28,311 --> 00:47:29,710
they may not agree you as being,

817
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:31,420
that's the worst thing
that ever happened to them.

818
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:35,560
What's so shocking in the work that I do
among high achievers is that I'll just

819
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:38,710
assume that the things that people love
or this and the things that they hate

820
00:47:38,711 --> 00:47:43,420
her, that, and I'm wrong every
single time that a person might say,

821
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:46,540
gosh, well what I hate about
this is that, that, uh,

822
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:51,250
nobody knows that I did the work and I'm
not getting recognition. And, and uh,

823
00:47:51,251 --> 00:47:53,860
so I don't feel significant here
unless I have a speaking part.

824
00:47:53,890 --> 00:47:56,470
And the next person over who's
a high achiever will say,

825
00:47:56,770 --> 00:48:00,370
what I hate most about this is I have to
get up every time and speak about this.

826
00:48:00,371 --> 00:48:02,260
I can't stand being in front of a crowd.

827
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:06,400
So to deconstruct what it is
that's that you hate so much,

828
00:48:06,401 --> 00:48:09,490
and I call this kind of
ballast the things that are,

829
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:11,320
if you were to look at the
high points in your life,

830
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:13,780
the proudest moments and the
worst moments in your life,

831
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:17,800
and just spend an extra moment looking
at why you hate the things you hate.

832
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:21,340
There's probably, uh, if
you flip that into energy,

833
00:48:21,341 --> 00:48:23,650
if you flip that into why
it's holding you down,

834
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:27,730
you'll get the insight into something
that could be really miraculous in your

835
00:48:27,731 --> 00:48:32,410
life. So my, my wife, who is my
coauthor on all of this work,

836
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:35,980
uh, her brother died when he
was 21, he was already taking,

837
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:39,040
he was already bicycling
over to NASA savant a genius.

838
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:45,070
And you might ask three people, obviously
the loss of a brother when you're 18,

839
00:48:45,071 --> 00:48:49,750
and he's 21 particularly would be
so profoundly impacting your life.

840
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:54,700
And you'll almost find as many reasons
in this room why that's a bad thing as

841
00:48:54,701 --> 00:48:57,310
there are people in this room.
But for her,

842
00:48:57,370 --> 00:49:01,150
the greatest loss was the lack of
contribution that he would have.

843
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:05,110
The rural lost a genius.
That's probably not the first thing.

844
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,370
The next three people would say.

845
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,950
So what did that do to inform what she
cherishes and believes that I'm going to

846
00:49:11,951 --> 00:49:14,470
spend my life?
I realized that's what I care about.

847
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:17,470
I'm projecting it on all the
other important people in my life.

848
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:22,390
So she spends her life trying to create
a life that matters for others. For me,

849
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:26,410
I was held back because of a developmental
disability. I never know a suit,

850
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:30,520
a person's intelligence or capacity until
we actually worked together to try to

851
00:49:30,521 --> 00:49:35,080
unlock what that is because everybody
has a certain form of genius and the most

852
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:38,680
key part of innovation is to try
to unlock that particular genius.

853
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,320
I have endless patients for
that because if I didn't,

854
00:49:41,321 --> 00:49:46,300
I wouldn't believe in myself. It's a, it's
a personal projection of that passion.

855
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:47,400
Yeah.

856
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:51,520
Thank you for this affair.
An inspirational talk. Um,

857
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:55,890
so the common definition of success
is a bit money, fortune and fame,

858
00:49:55,891 --> 00:49:56,750
power and all that.

859
00:49:56,751 --> 00:50:00,360
And then I can tell if I'm going to
talk like you and your friends probably

860
00:50:00,361 --> 00:50:04,910
enjoyed a lot of that. My meanwhile,
we're all losers. We're just, yeah.

861
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:05,530
By meanwhile,

862
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:09,180
do you agree that I'm in [inaudible]
people just don't have those majority by

863
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:10,410
just common people. Yes. You know,

864
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:14,430
my sound was it goes to homestead
high and I tried to east by him, Hey,

865
00:50:14,431 --> 00:50:18,530
look at this Steve Job,
Great Java. He said, dad,

866
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:22,290
he was just an exception.
I'm a normal kid. Yes,

867
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:27,290
that makes sense. So it's a fair,
it's a fair point, right? Yeah.

868
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:32,470
Do you think not fall common people he
saw seen point of the fan debt sacked

869
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:37,700
Sachi and can pan farm from just
doing normal things just be 10,

870
00:50:37,791 --> 00:50:41,840
10. We see. Why don't we,
we got absolutely just for
a paying job at Google.

871
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,990
That's what happened. Yeah. Yeah.

872
00:50:44,991 --> 00:50:47,920
You're definitely a very
normal underprivileged Gugler

873
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:51,680
because

874
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,513
do you know they're just,

875
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:57,530
that sets the bar a certain place that
is maybe a little also privileged. Um,

876
00:50:57,890 --> 00:50:58,790
the point of all this,

877
00:50:58,791 --> 00:51:02,090
it really is that it's for each and every
one of us to find their, our purpose,

878
00:51:02,091 --> 00:51:03,140
our passion and performance.

879
00:51:03,141 --> 00:51:06,020
The only reason I used to famous
examples is because you know them.

880
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:10,310
And because I was shocked
at how inadequate each and
every one of them were to

881
00:51:10,311 --> 00:51:12,260
the task that they were faced with.
And yes,

882
00:51:12,261 --> 00:51:14,300
maybe they're the long
tail or the Unicorn,

883
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:19,430
but each and every one of us or a unicorn
that that that really we should be

884
00:51:19,431 --> 00:51:20,091
looking at.

885
00:51:20,091 --> 00:51:22,730
The standard that we're
setting the standard that
you're setting at Google from

886
00:51:22,731 --> 00:51:26,480
your son is that he lived
a life that matters to him.

887
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:32,180
Nobody else can make that decision
for him. And that's the silent scream.

888
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:37,360
So your job is to say not to talk about
Steve Jobs because he's actually a

889
00:51:37,881 --> 00:51:38,990
terrible role model,

890
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:45,430
is to talk about what's so special about
him that he lays up at night thinking

891
00:51:46,521 --> 00:51:49,850
about that. He's afraid to talk to
you about that you could empower.

892
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:53,360
So he could be lighting
up the sky with that work.

893
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:57,950
It may not be politically correct.
He may not become a doctor or a lawyer,

894
00:51:58,130 --> 00:52:02,150
but he might end up being the best
creator. You might be the best inventor.

895
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:03,710
What could you feed?

896
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:07,730
Jane Goodall would lose the daughter
at four eight she was four years old.

897
00:52:07,731 --> 00:52:08,760
She'd wander off and,

898
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:11,720
and she'd looked for hours for a daughter
and daughter would be found there.

899
00:52:11,721 --> 00:52:15,350
She was looking at the lizards and
she was looking at the bugs. Well,

900
00:52:15,351 --> 00:52:19,010
that wasn't a politically
correct profession in a
family that had all doctors

901
00:52:19,011 --> 00:52:22,490
and lawyers and she became jade
Goodall. So there's a, there's a,

902
00:52:22,491 --> 00:52:25,880
there's a shred of a place of,
of joy and contribution and,

903
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:30,200
and that's what we as parents
are so challenged to. Yes.

904
00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:33,780
Um, there was a quote earlier
is something about, um,

905
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:38,200
winners and losers and winners
lose more than losers. Yeah.

906
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:42,960
I was just wondering how would you justify
your losers? It's, it's not a fair,

907
00:52:42,961 --> 00:52:46,290
I'm glad you pointed it out because I'd
be supremely disappointed if I didn't

908
00:52:46,291 --> 00:52:49,530
get called on that. So thank you.
Give her a big round of applause.

909
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:53,070
So if there's any great exception,
I think

910
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:56,490
by the way this is presented,
you'd never talk about winners and losers.

911
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,700
The reason I did that though
is for a very specific reason,

912
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:03,150
and that is that if
you talk to people who,

913
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:07,380
if you didn't know that they had had
some celebrity or, or additional success,

914
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:11,490
you'd find that they spent more airtime
talking on their failures than their

915
00:53:11,491 --> 00:53:12,324
successes.

916
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:17,830
That they were learning from iterating
towards an outcome that they will,

917
00:53:17,831 --> 00:53:21,000
to seeking. The point I was really
trying to make there is that we,

918
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:24,420
we fail more often than we succeed if
we're really trying hard at something we

919
00:53:24,421 --> 00:53:26,670
care about and that's okay.
In fact,

920
00:53:26,671 --> 00:53:30,180
that's the only way to
fail forward to success.

921
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:36,320
Usually 10 times more losses than
wins for people who were trying to do

922
00:53:36,511 --> 00:53:37,680
something meaningful.
Yeah.

923
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:41,710
If you feel like you don't
have a silent scream,

924
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:46,120
is it better to a hope
it comes organically, uh,

925
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:50,080
be cultivate one that
you want to have or see.

926
00:53:50,081 --> 00:53:52,600
Just kind of give up on
the idea that you matter.

927
00:53:55,270 --> 00:53:57,520
It sounds like a standard
Google bubble test.

928
00:53:57,521 --> 00:54:00,460
Isn't there a d all of the
above or none of the above?

929
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:07,050
Um, the, this, it doesn't have
to be so much a silent scream.

930
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:10,020
I mean the good news might
be do you enjoy your work

931
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:15,450
moderately, moderately. I
enjoy everything moderately.

932
00:54:15,451 --> 00:54:17,640
So like there's not like a peak or a low.

933
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:21,660
Okay. So it's a matter of starting to
notice whether there's peaks or Lowe's.

934
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:25,720
It's starting to notice the things that
really irritate you the most because

935
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:28,120
there might be the germ of something
you really care about there.

936
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:32,410
So I have good friends who you know,
are just offended if they see bad code.

937
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:37,060
Um, I see. I have friends who are
offended if they see a bad ad written.

938
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:40,510
These are things are insights into maybe
she should be spending some more time

939
00:54:40,511 --> 00:54:41,890
doing copywriting on ads.

940
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:46,150
And that's not something you've ever
been offered in your life most likely.

941
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:51,010
It's so amazing to me being a late parent
and having my daughter go to a grade

942
00:54:51,011 --> 00:54:53,430
school like Berkeley. But it's
interesting asking the kids don't,

943
00:54:53,431 --> 00:54:56,410
what do you want to do and why do you
keep changing your mind? It's because dad,

944
00:54:56,411 --> 00:54:58,390
we never got asked a choice.

945
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:02,530
We were never offered an opportunity
to test new ideas out. Right.

946
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:05,950
That's not what you're really allowed
to do. Pass the AP test, right?

947
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:10,240
Get the performance done. So things
do end up getting kind of mediocre.

948
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:13,600
Like I like everything kind of moderately
well cause I did get A's in those

949
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:17,140
classes. But you really haven't
been offered this opportunity.

950
00:55:17,141 --> 00:55:20,170
Now to step back for a moment and look
at the things that are your highs and

951
00:55:20,171 --> 00:55:22,540
your lows,
you'll start to see some of them.

952
00:55:22,870 --> 00:55:25,780
And if you do some more
reading about the passion test,

953
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:29,680
you're going to find that some of those
areas do activate you more than others.

954
00:55:29,681 --> 00:55:31,720
Some are,
you're better at some of those.

955
00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:36,040
Speak to you more and that that might
be a way to start to find a way to lean

956
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:39,130
into those, those ideas. All
right. Thank you everybody.

957
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:41,450
Appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you.
