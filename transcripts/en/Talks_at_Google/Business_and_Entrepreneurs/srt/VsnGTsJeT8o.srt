1
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,940
Thank you. Uh, my name is again, Josh,

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:12,190
his tail and I run accessible to
pan and it's a website day, dies,

3
00:00:12,191 --> 00:00:14,240
shares the accessibility features of uh,

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,320
living in Japan with people who
are interested in visiting a,

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,750
they'd have a disability. I didn't
grow up in a height Roppongi hills,

6
00:00:21,751 --> 00:00:25,930
but a instead of when I looked out my
window, this is what I saw. And um,

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,260
this is the view from my bedroom.
I live in a small,

8
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:32,370
small town outside of Oxbridge and it
was as her ex as I've Toronto called

9
00:00:32,371 --> 00:00:37,260
experts. And, uh, it was me, my
sisters, my parents, and about 20 sheep.

10
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,920
Um, so that's why I like spending
most of my time looking at

11
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,090
now I have what's called cerebral palsy.
And a,

12
00:00:45,091 --> 00:00:48,690
it's a very fancy way of saying
that I have brain damage. Uh,

13
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,090
there's two types of, uh, ways
to describe brain damage. And uh,

14
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,370
after your brain is filling this
developing and you may have an accident or

15
00:00:56,371 --> 00:00:57,204
something like that,

16
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,300
then that'd be regular type of brain
damage through palsy happens when your

17
00:01:00,301 --> 00:01:04,450
brain is still developing. So when you're
very young and because of that, uh,

18
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,750
as you develop, your body
will develop differently. Um,

19
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,220
and it can have a wide
variety. Um, for example,

20
00:01:11,221 --> 00:01:14,910
some people can just have a little bit
of a trouble moving their arms around and

21
00:01:14,911 --> 00:01:18,570
other people can be completely after
the stay in bed all the time. I'm,

22
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,200
I'm somewhat in the middle, I'm
classified as severe. Um, but for me,

23
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,310
the way it affects me is my arms and
my legs. So they're physically healthy,

24
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,570
but the signals from our brain don't
properly get conveyed to move the muscles

25
00:01:30,571 --> 00:01:34,350
the way I want. And because it happened
when I was young, when I developed a,

26
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:38,490
for example, my hands, um, the muscles
of the bottom were always tight.

27
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,270
And so as I grew bigger, because it was
tight, my hands started to bend down.

28
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:45,480
So when you look at pictures, when I was
a kid, my hands were much more street.

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,040
And so that's where one of
the main differences between
regular brain damage and

30
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:50,874
cerebral palsy.

31
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,640
So would that mean for my daily life?
Well,

32
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,120
I have to have somebody who it's called
a helper and maybe an English would be

33
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:02,100
more commonly called a
personal care assistant.

34
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,790
So today I'm here with the highest son,

35
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:07,320
so I'm very thankful for his
assistance every day of my life. Um,

36
00:02:07,321 --> 00:02:10,110
so what happens is I, uh,
people with disabilities,

37
00:02:10,111 --> 00:02:13,800
you can get evaluated by the city
they're living in and they get a certain

38
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:17,860
number of hours that they can
use in their daily life. Um,

39
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,880
and then you get a contract with different
companies in your local area and make

40
00:02:23,861 --> 00:02:26,130
schedules for your daily routine.

41
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,160
So my helpers help me from the
first thing in the morning.

42
00:02:29,161 --> 00:02:30,450
So the first person I see in the morning,

43
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,410
last person I see at night is my
helper and a not so romantic, but um,

44
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,690
so, um, but uh, yeah, so
they helped me get up in the
morning and to have a shower,

45
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,970
get dressed, et cetera.
I get ready for work.

46
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,450
And then after work they help me maybe
with some shopping or with, um, uh,

47
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,270
cooking or cleaning around the house.

48
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,160
And then the nights they
helped me get into bed.

49
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,690
And do it all again the next
day for when I go out. Um,

50
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,470
my day life requires a lot of
planning. Uh, planning ahead. Um,

51
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:01,690
not something can just jump on a train
and go meet somebody somewhere. Um,

52
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,420
I need to think of, for example, if I have
that night, I have a helper scheduled,

53
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,030
I have to be back before the helper comes.
Uh,

54
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:10,150
we're also have to pay the cancellation
fee or it may not be able to get into

55
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:13,360
bed. Um, when I think
about transportation,

56
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:15,980
I always have to leave extra time and he,
uh,

57
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,050
transfer usually probably takes about
20 minutes longer than it says on the

58
00:03:20,051 --> 00:03:21,810
Google maps. So, um,

59
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,210
I'd say those things into account when
I'm going out with friends as well.

60
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:27,100
I need to think about restaurants.
Um,

61
00:03:27,101 --> 00:03:29,680
it can be a very big challenge
to find a place to eat.

62
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,040
It's a very simple task for most people,
but for me,

63
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,450
because of my electric wheelchair,

64
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:36,880
it's very difficult to get
into many restaurants, uh,

65
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,650
particularly in Japan where there tend
to be very small. Um, and there's a,

66
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,990
I love Japan, but I don't like,
again, con because it's a,

67
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:50,590
it's a step that you know, keeps me
out. So it can be discouraging at times.

68
00:03:50,591 --> 00:03:55,090
I'm trying to go, maybe you want to eat
ramen and, um, so you're out with friends.

69
00:03:55,091 --> 00:03:58,030
You want to go get Ramen, you find
a lot of delicious looking places,

70
00:03:58,031 --> 00:03:59,980
but you can't get into any of them.
Uh,

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,200
and then you end up having to go to a
family restaurant or something like that.

72
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:02,740
And then,

73
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:07,360
so planning ahead is very important so
you can figure out what is available for

74
00:04:07,361 --> 00:04:11,800
you.
So with all those extra requirements,

75
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:15,280
why would I come to Japan? Um, and
what was talked about earlier. Um,

76
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:19,060
I took a class in Japanese in high
school and my Japanese teacher,

77
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:22,240
he really loves Japan and that was
infectious. And so I thought, oh,

78
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:24,700
I wanted to try going.
And, uh, my parents,

79
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,920
they always encouraged
me to follow my dreams.

80
00:04:26,921 --> 00:04:29,590
They always said that even
though you have a disability, um,

81
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:33,940
you can do what other people can do to
a certain degree or as the same as them.

82
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:38,590
Um, it may just take a bit more time
or do things a little bit differently,

83
00:04:38,591 --> 00:04:40,720
but you should always follow your dreams.

84
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:45,370
Now they say they regret that because I
moved to Japan now and never go home. Um,

85
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,930
but, but when the first time I came there
was really little to no information on

86
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:53,590
accessibility in Japan. Um, now
Google was around at that point and,

87
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:57,940
but if there's nothing to find, then
your search results are zero. Um, so,

88
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:02,530
uh, through lot of phone calls
and very, very vague, um,

89
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,200
books and stuff or
decide to take the risk.

90
00:05:05,201 --> 00:05:09,520
And I came to Japan with my dad for a
couple of weeks back in the year 2000.

91
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:13,710
And, um, I was really surprised
to find how to spell Japan was a,

92
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,440
it was different than my expectations,
I think. And, um, I realized that hey,

93
00:05:17,441 --> 00:05:18,490
this is a place I could live.

94
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:22,390
And so after finishing university I
decided that I wanted to come and move to

95
00:05:22,391 --> 00:05:27,160
Japan. When I did that, there was a
real requirement for a lot of logistics.

96
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,770
As I said,
I need helpers in Canada.

97
00:05:29,771 --> 00:05:32,080
The government provides the
helpers in Japan as well.

98
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:35,330
The government provides a
helpers, but in the interim, um,

99
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,410
I need to bring somebody with me to take
care of me until I could get into the

100
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:39,244
system.

101
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:43,060
So I had to come with someone for about
six months until I was able to fully in.

102
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,180
And, um, as well as
finding a place to live,

103
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,310
it can be very difficult
to find an apartment.

104
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,270
It's accessible to wheelchair
users. Um, so yeah, again,

105
00:05:52,271 --> 00:05:54,800
a lot of planning and to
overcoming logistics. Uh,

106
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:58,460
but I got here and I've been here
for 10 years now and as mentioned,

107
00:05:58,461 --> 00:06:01,100
I became a Japanese
citizen last year and a,

108
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:03,560
so I'm actually no longer Canadian
citizen because I had to give up my

109
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:07,610
citizenship. But, um, but here I am to
stay for good. Whether you like it or not.

110
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:10,730
Uh,

111
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:13,730
the company I work at right now is called
as elite group and one of their court,

112
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,310
um, principals is giving back to the, uh,

113
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:20,690
going back to the society and your local
community. And uh, I feel the same way.

114
00:06:20,691 --> 00:06:21,524
And,
um,

115
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:25,550
so I wanted to use the experiences I had
as a person with a disability does come

116
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,700
from another country and,
uh,

117
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:31,460
probably very few people
like that in Japan at the
moment. So I thought I should,

118
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:35,440
uh, use what I have to give back.
Um, so that brought me to the,

119
00:06:35,441 --> 00:06:38,570
the need that a lot of people face.
I think that,

120
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,640
well it's true with those stairs here.
Um,

121
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,040
of course it started personal when I just
wanted to go out with friends or if I

122
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,950
wanted to go on vacation
in Japan, uh, just the,

123
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,240
the challenge of finding
the right information, uh,

124
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:54,950
because you don't want to go on a vacation
and then find out that you can't get

125
00:06:54,951 --> 00:06:59,720
into your hotel because I'd
be very traumatic. Um, so
in doing a lot of research,

126
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:03,320
um,
I thought I was able to read Japanese now,

127
00:07:03,321 --> 00:07:05,850
so I was looking at things in Japanese.
I realize there's still,

128
00:07:05,851 --> 00:07:09,300
it wasn't much information in English,
uh, for people with disabilities. And, um,

129
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,300
just as an example here,

130
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:16,980
you're of course going to go to a tourist
sites when you're coming here. And, uh,

131
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,560
if you look at this website,
um,

132
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:23,810
you look at the information
that's available in English
and as very basic things

133
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:27,440
like the regular hours days close,
which is a very useful information for,

134
00:07:27,441 --> 00:07:29,870
I'm just your average
visitor. Uh, but you know,

135
00:07:29,871 --> 00:07:33,140
you don't know anything about it if you're
in a wheelchair, uh, what's available.

136
00:07:33,141 --> 00:07:33,411
You know,

137
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:36,830
if you go all the way out there are going
to be able to actually enjoy the place.

138
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,640
But if you look on the Japanese site,
uh, they have a lot of information to,

139
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:41,421
for example,
it came,

140
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:45,620
how far can you go up the castle or their
wheelchairs available friends or their

141
00:07:45,621 --> 00:07:49,310
wheelchair toilets available,
where are they? Um, so all
that information is there,

142
00:07:49,311 --> 00:07:52,850
but it's available only in
Japanese. Um, so for most people,

143
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:56,530
they're not going to necessarily go
and look and translate the webpage,

144
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:01,370
a website, uh, because if you're not in
English, then there's nothing there. So,

145
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,630
so there's a real difference between the
English and Japanese versions of places

146
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:10,970
as well for your hotels, this website
and they have a, the universal twin,

147
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:11,660
um,

148
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:16,660
that sort of another side side notice
that the phrasing in Japan and in North

149
00:08:16,971 --> 00:08:20,590
America or Europe or wherever it is
quite different. So Universal Twain,

150
00:08:20,591 --> 00:08:23,760
if you said that at some data, I have
no idea what you're talking about. Um,

151
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:28,010
or a barrier freak NOI,
you would know what that means in,

152
00:08:28,011 --> 00:08:31,340
in mostly English speaking countries.
Most people search for accessible.

153
00:08:31,341 --> 00:08:33,920
So even if it was written
in as barrier free,

154
00:08:33,921 --> 00:08:37,940
that's not likely going to click for
somebody who doesn't know the terminology.

155
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,190
And then again on the same site,

156
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:43,370
if you look at the English page of the
rooms didn't nonetheless the universal

157
00:08:43,371 --> 00:08:47,320
twin being available. Now,
there's probably a practical
reason to this and that,

158
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,620
um,
they need,

159
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:52,070
they can't use the booking system to
book accessible rooms for the most part

160
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,570
because they want to ensure that,
uh,

161
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,910
it's people who are actually have
disabilities that are using it.

162
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:00,060
So generally you need to have some sort
of communication with the hotel to book

163
00:09:00,061 --> 00:09:03,980
your room. Um, and so maybe the
hotel made a decision that, um,

164
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:08,740
we don't have enough English staff to
be able to handle those requests. Um,

165
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,800
or they might have come to the idea that,
oh no,

166
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,700
we are just going to be
coming visiting anyways.

167
00:09:13,701 --> 00:09:16,290
So there's no point in
translating this webpage as well.

168
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:21,180
So as realizing that there's a lot of
challenges that people who want to come

169
00:09:21,181 --> 00:09:23,100
just for vacation, um, have,

170
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:28,110
so that led me to the journey of a
starting to accessible to Penn. I,

171
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:29,640
I like this picture.
My mom took it.

172
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:34,370
I didn't know [inaudible] I wish she had
a better phone log. So better pictures.

173
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,700
So my mission statement for,
um,

174
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:42,210
accessible Japan is to provide as much
information as possible on accessibility

175
00:09:42,211 --> 00:09:43,020
in Japan.

176
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:46,620
So travelers with disabilities can make
informed decisions based on their needs

177
00:09:46,621 --> 00:09:48,270
so they can enjoy Japan to its fullest.

178
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,570
So the end result is I want people
to enjoy Japan. I love Japan.

179
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,530
That's why I've moved here and that's
where I want to stay here forever. Um,

180
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,900
and I want people to enjoy the,
his van as well,

181
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,410
but a lot of people dispersed when
they're looking for places to go.

182
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:02,790
If there's not the information there,

183
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:05,820
they don't want necessarily spend all
the money to come over here if they don't

184
00:10:05,821 --> 00:10:07,890
know what they're going to come into.
Um,

185
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,790
so I tried to get as much
information as possible and uh,

186
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:14,430
there are so many different
types of disabilities.

187
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,320
I can't say displace successful.

188
00:10:16,321 --> 00:10:19,290
This place is not acceptable because
that's not something I can decide for

189
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:20,310
everybody.
Um,

190
00:10:20,311 --> 00:10:23,790
so what I do is I tried to provide as
much information as possible and then they

191
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:27,080
can make decisions based
on their own needs and uh,

192
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:30,600
whether they go to those
places are not so accessible.

193
00:10:30,601 --> 00:10:34,410
Japan has been constantly pivoting
and updating, evolving. Um,

194
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,610
I like to take credit for
all of the ideas, but, um,

195
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:42,030
a lot of them come from interacting
with people who have contacted me. Um,

196
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:46,950
for example, I have a page on, um,
bringing your guide dog to Japan.

197
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,070
That's not something I've ever considered
a, but somebody asked me a question,

198
00:10:50,071 --> 00:10:52,560
well, what's the system like
for bringing guy, Doctor Japan?

199
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:57,050
And because of that idea that that
were part of the webpage was born. Um,

200
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:58,440
so it's constantly been changing.

201
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,630
At first it was just basic
information on how to get around me,

202
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,020
be on a train or um,

203
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:09,590
what it's like to try to find a hotel or
just sort of very general ideas and as

204
00:11:10,321 --> 00:11:11,610
well as a blog.

205
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,240
And they use the blog to introduce
different parts of Japan to people,

206
00:11:17,851 --> 00:11:22,380
for example, um, how to find a
restaurant if you have a wheelchair or,

207
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:26,810
um, even parts of Japanese culture.
So there's the anime there,

208
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:31,530
a silent voice in the character
from that, uh, story. She has a,

209
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,050
she's deaf,
so she has trouble communicating.

210
00:11:34,051 --> 00:11:37,560
And so that's sort of part of the story
and in general about human communication.

211
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,200
So somebody wrote a review for that
side, put that on there as well. So,

212
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,460
and then of course, I have a
youtube channel as well. Uh,

213
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:48,360
I use youtube different than a lot of
people use and that I look at people's

214
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,230
reviews of places and don't really listen
to what they're saying by constantly

215
00:11:52,231 --> 00:11:56,260
looking at the ground, see if their
steps or if there's any barriers. Um,

216
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,300
so because of that I realized,
Oh, I thought I should,

217
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:02,320
I probably should have some videos as
well because it speaks much more than a

218
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:07,120
few pictures or my comments.
So I try to provide as much information,

219
00:12:07,121 --> 00:12:11,470
the videos as well.
And again,

220
00:12:11,471 --> 00:12:12,281
going back to the hotel,

221
00:12:12,281 --> 00:12:16,120
so I created a searchable database
of hotels with accessible rooms.

222
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,240
If you go to places like rock
10 or other travel sites,

223
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:22,960
you have a little checkbox in the extra
information where you can check off is

224
00:12:22,961 --> 00:12:24,370
accessible or not.
Uh,

225
00:12:24,371 --> 00:12:27,640
but usually that just says that there is
an accessible room you still up to you

226
00:12:27,641 --> 00:12:29,080
to go and research everything.

227
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:34,240
So I tried to correlate
all the information I could
get and put it into the

228
00:12:34,241 --> 00:12:37,130
database.
So I got that either through the,

229
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,830
where the variation is available on the
websites or contacting the hotels with

230
00:12:41,831 --> 00:12:46,180
surveys and asking. And as well as getting
people to put their own reviews on. Um,

231
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,710
and a lot of those things
include, uh, toilets.

232
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,950
This will come up a couple of times.
So I hope you use the toilets, um,

233
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,560
is something everybody needs to do.
And um,

234
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:59,430
it's something that's very important if
you're going to be spending the mind to

235
00:12:59,431 --> 00:13:03,370
state place. And I'm in places
like Europe or in North America,

236
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,480
there are very strict rules about when
an accessible room is like they have, um,

237
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:11,830
maybe what angles, uh, the walls are
at, how you can approach the toilet,

238
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,220
how much space is between the beds, et
cetera. And it's all very well dictated.

239
00:13:15,221 --> 00:13:19,900
So you can in general with insurance,
rent a room and a, you know,

240
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:22,180
you're going to be okay.
We're in Japan is,

241
00:13:22,181 --> 00:13:25,180
tends to be more general
guidelines of what's accessible.

242
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:30,010
So you can find two places to hotels
with a quote unquote accessible rooms and

243
00:13:30,011 --> 00:13:33,220
one will have maybe some handlebars
next to the toilet. And that's it.

244
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:36,250
That's the only difference from
a regular room. And other places,

245
00:13:36,251 --> 00:13:39,940
we'll have these huge sprawling rooms
with the toilet that's covered in white

246
00:13:39,941 --> 00:13:42,880
tiles and looks like a hospital with all
these equipment that you've never seen

247
00:13:42,881 --> 00:13:46,000
before. Um, so it can be quite a variety.

248
00:13:46,001 --> 00:13:50,710
So I tried to show that I'm on the reviews
of the hotels as well. Uh, bathrooms,

249
00:13:50,711 --> 00:13:54,580
of course the showers are difficult at
times because people can necessarily get

250
00:13:54,581 --> 00:13:55,414
into the bathtub.

251
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:59,170
A lot of the places in North America will
have a roll in shower so you can drive

252
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:03,880
your wheelchair right into
the shower area. Uh, but a
lot of places in Japan, very,

253
00:14:03,881 --> 00:14:05,500
very few have those.
Um,

254
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:10,360
so I had a little life hack is that you
can, you can see on the ground there,

255
00:14:10,361 --> 00:14:14,290
there's actually a drain on the floor. Um,
so as long as you don't tell the staff,

256
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:19,291
you can put the chair next to the bathroom
in the bathtub and shower there as

257
00:14:19,571 --> 00:14:21,640
well as just information on
what the rooms look like. So,

258
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:26,020
not all of them have that
kind of integration, but as
much as I can get as well,

259
00:14:26,021 --> 00:14:27,970
of course people want to see
things when they come to Japan.

260
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:31,390
So I write reviews of attractions.
Um, because I live in Tokyo,

261
00:14:31,391 --> 00:14:35,050
most of the interactions tend to be in
Tokyo area by of some others as well.

262
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,770
So they have general information,
like a irregular Japan Guide,

263
00:14:38,771 --> 00:14:40,300
whoever would have some
background information,

264
00:14:40,301 --> 00:14:43,030
how to get there with the
hours are et Cetera, um,

265
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:46,240
by going to other details
as well. Uh, for example,

266
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,990
if they say they have an elevator,
um,

267
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,650
I tried to try it out and see what
it's like. So you're on the website,

268
00:14:51,651 --> 00:14:52,760
it says there's an elevator,

269
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:55,350
but I wouldn't be able to use this one
by myself cause there's not enough room

270
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,420
to turn around or push the buttons.
But again,

271
00:14:57,421 --> 00:14:59,480
it's just that doesn't mean
that you can't go there.

272
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:03,770
It's just you should know that in advance.
Uh, as well as maybe for the gardens,

273
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:07,610
the routes that are available
for accessible travel. Um,

274
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:12,770
some have like this is a Dq
van, I think. And it has, um,

275
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,620
equate sense of coverage of the grounds.
Uh,

276
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,810
but some places they only happened maybe
about a quarter of the places actually

277
00:15:20,811 --> 00:15:23,180
accessible. So you, if
you're gonna be going there,

278
00:15:23,181 --> 00:15:25,910
you might not to want to
intentionally go into that area

279
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:30,860
and just the little things that
may occur along your path, uh,

280
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,150
such as these steps.

281
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:37,280
And of course toilets if there's only one
more minute of quiet. So bear with me.

282
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,680
Um, so yeah, when you're going out,

283
00:15:39,681 --> 00:15:42,320
you didn't say essential things
mean most people don't think about.

284
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:45,980
But if you're going to be traveling around
and you need to use the toilet in the

285
00:15:45,981 --> 00:15:48,380
pinch, you want it to know
that something's available.

286
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,660
So this helps people go and just
sort of rest assured that, you know,

287
00:15:50,661 --> 00:15:55,150
there is something there and I don't
need to worry about it too much. Uh,

288
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,140
the next thing is I did a,
um,

289
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:02,030
general glossary and a phrase
book for Japanese to English. Um,

290
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,720
and again, that was started because
someone asked me some questions,

291
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,520
how do you say this or this?
So I translated that,

292
00:16:07,521 --> 00:16:08,690
that I'll wash it by page on that.

293
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:11,900
And actually lonely planet contacted
me and they're going to use this as the

294
00:16:11,901 --> 00:16:15,050
basis for their, um,
accessible travel guides.

295
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,370
Okay.

296
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:19,740
And tourists. I, I'm not
a person who likes tour.

297
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:24,540
It's normally like to go on my own path
but never go. We're interested in tours.

298
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:28,100
And so I was able to work with a
couple of different companies to, uh,

299
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,570
consult on accessible tours in Japan.

300
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,080
This company is called the inside
Japan tours and they serve,

301
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,410
offer a complete package,

302
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:37,680
but there's a couple of other ones I would
work with that have a, does day tours.

303
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,370
And um, and so yeah, they,

304
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:44,080
it gives them a chance to experience what
it's like to go around and give it to

305
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:47,580
her. So we went to a couple of different,
uh, tourist locations in Tokyo.

306
00:16:47,581 --> 00:16:50,430
We rode the train together because it's
one thing just to sort of read something

307
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:53,490
in the website. This is how it works
as opposed to actually experience it.

308
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:57,090
And within a couple of months
of actually having this tour,

309
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,580
they had their first disabled as guests.

310
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:04,020
And so they're able to give that
present to around Japan because of the

311
00:17:04,021 --> 00:17:07,120
consulting.
And I'm,

312
00:17:07,121 --> 00:17:09,830
I'm writing an accessible
Japan and we your number one,

313
00:17:09,831 --> 00:17:11,690
but this is number two here on the screen.

314
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,040
A lot of people actually
request a wheelchairs or
other mental medical equipment

315
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:19,250
in it pinches, uh, for most people
they take their wheelchair with them.

316
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:22,160
But there's been times where
I've been contacted by somebody,

317
00:17:22,161 --> 00:17:24,470
maybe they broke their leg two
weeks before their vacation.

318
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,380
I need to rent a
wheelchair, you know, or um,

319
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,870
I'm going with my grandmother
and she can't walk very far.

320
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,300
And do you know what plays,
I can rent the wheels wheelchair,

321
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:35,570
I don't want to buy one just for
coming in Japan. So, uh, I attend,

322
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:39,620
tend to work with a rental companies
for providing most of those.

323
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:43,320
I subcontracted them. Um,
but yeah, for in a pinch,

324
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,930
this one can fold it up and it's a bag
and I can send it by you been to anywhere

325
00:17:47,931 --> 00:17:50,100
in the country within a day or so.

326
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:55,220
And then of course, people want to
take something with them sometimes, um,

327
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,700
to carry all the information. And it's
even if they have a phone with them,

328
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:02,730
they don't want to use the data or
something to search on the website.

329
00:18:02,731 --> 00:18:07,440
So I made the accessible Japan
travel guide for Tokyo and uh, you,

330
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,760
it's available right now if you want to
buy it on that truths and look at that.

331
00:18:11,761 --> 00:18:16,620
It's got five stars.
And recently I started the uh,

332
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,330
a forum for the website.

333
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:23,640
A lot of the interactions with guests
or with a different people have been,

334
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:28,200
um, very important questions that,
you know, if you're just doing email,

335
00:18:28,201 --> 00:18:31,350
it's sort of one on one and only people
that are involved that email can see the

336
00:18:31,351 --> 00:18:32,184
information.

337
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,880
But a lot of the questions I think could
be very helpful to other people as well.

338
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:40,300
Uh, so in a forum kind of base then
it's searchable. People can find it. Um,

339
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:42,660
when they're looking for things as well.

340
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,140
If there's something I want to put some
information on that doesn't necessarily

341
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,430
require a four page,

342
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:52,530
just having a little bit of a way to add
quick information has been a very big

343
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:57,210
help. And A, I've been growing steadily
compared to last year. I pretty much,

344
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,930
it's pretty much doubled in
access, um, just in the last year.

345
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,550
So that is very exciting,

346
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,290
except the more exciting thing is the
communication with people who are using

347
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:10,860
the website. And, uh, recently I
was contacted by someone who said,

348
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,680
your site has really encouraged
me to take my daughter to Japan.

349
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:16,410
She has cerebral palsy and
cannot walk very long distances,

350
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,540
so she needs a wheelchair
to usually get around.

351
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:23,490
We were planning a trip for next year.
And so when I talked with this person,

352
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,520
uh, his daughter loves anime,
so her dream is to go to Ikea,

353
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,670
Alberta and a knock on Broadway.

354
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,270
And so use asking about Nahko Broadway
and actually I'm not an enemy and so I'd

355
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:38,100
never heard of it. And so, but I took the
opportunity to add that to the website,

356
00:19:38,101 --> 00:19:40,770
so I went and did a review of it.
Um,

357
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,650
but that was a real encouragement to me
that because that's the whole purpose of

358
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:47,250
this website is to encourage people
to come to Japan and enjoy it.

359
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:51,120
And to have someone actually say
that, you know, because of this,

360
00:19:51,121 --> 00:19:54,540
I had the courage to bring
my daughter here. So,

361
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,303
okay,

362
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:00,740
so accessible. Japan and Google
have a very strong relationship.

363
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:05,630
I think the first thing is that our
shared goals and Google's of course,

364
00:20:05,631 --> 00:20:08,300
is to organize the world's information
and make it universally accessible and

365
00:20:08,301 --> 00:20:12,530
useful. And I think that's very
common goal that we have as well. Um,

366
00:20:12,531 --> 00:20:15,290
I'm sort of maybe a microcosm
of that and that, uh,

367
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:20,090
I'm using a very niche information,
uh,

368
00:20:20,091 --> 00:20:21,210
that not a lot of people use bites.

369
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,900
So put it in one place and make it
accessible and useful to people.

370
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:26,663
Let's see.

371
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,830
Uh, in my day to day use, of course,
Google search is probably the,

372
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:34,660
the biggest thing. I use a in a
two way kind of communications.

373
00:20:34,661 --> 00:20:38,280
So people find, um, bunch of
bands or Google search, uh,

374
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:42,710
because of the nature of the website being
a preparation for traveling somewhere,

375
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:48,070
it tends that people only use it until
they go Japan and then after that they

376
00:20:48,611 --> 00:20:51,850
don't really return. So the majority
of my visitors are new visitors.

377
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:55,820
So through Google search they're able to
find the website. And then for myself,

378
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,270
because I can't go to every place that,
um,

379
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:02,170
I need to go to or just to answer
random questions that come up, I'm,

380
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,910
I'm constantly googling
things. So I'm very, very, very
grateful for for your work.

381
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,710
And you can definitely put me at the top
of the rankings if you went intent. Um,

382
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:15,070
Google analytics and something
else I use quite frequently. Um,

383
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,490
and I'm actually slightly addicted
to it. Uh, have it on my phone.

384
00:21:18,491 --> 00:21:21,410
I'm constantly checking how many visitors
I get to, how many visitors to get to.

385
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,510
Um, and it, but more importantly,
it helps me to focus, um,

386
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,150
through looking at the
statistics. I can see, okay,

387
00:21:28,151 --> 00:21:30,370
well this area of the
website isn't very popular.

388
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:34,180
People aren't using it very much,
but this area is gay. A lot of hits.

389
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,960
So people have definitely interested
in this area. So I should put my,

390
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,450
because I have limited amount
of time and um, they need to,

391
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:45,250
I can focus on this so I can put my effort
into places where people can benefit

392
00:21:45,251 --> 00:21:50,080
the most. Google maps of courses,
uh, essential for the, uh,

393
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,730
hotel searches as well as for me
for looking up information and uh,

394
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:58,950
routes for people. And of course,
uh, servers aren't free. So, um,

395
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:03,200
Google adsense helps offset some of
the costs for running the website.

396
00:22:03,201 --> 00:22:04,720
So I'm very thankful for that.

397
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,190
And then sort of in closing and started
to have some general disability in

398
00:22:09,191 --> 00:22:12,850
Google, um, working together
and the essentials of that.

399
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:19,360
So I think it's important to have a
wide variety of input on products.

400
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:23,290
Um, so it's either customers or people
who are working for the company,

401
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:27,460
they can input to those things and you
can find some unexpected things you've

402
00:22:27,461 --> 00:22:31,270
heard probably many times about somebody
invented some product they thought was

403
00:22:31,271 --> 00:22:35,050
going to go off and sell really well,
but it doesn't.

404
00:22:35,051 --> 00:22:37,570
But then they had some
unexpected use cases for it.

405
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:42,120
And that ended up turning into be some
huge different world changing ivs.

406
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:46,480
So I encourage you to look for unexpected
use cases and a lot of people with

407
00:22:46,481 --> 00:22:50,140
disabilities have them.
For example, a street view,

408
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,800
most people maybe would use it for
when they're driving to look for, okay,

409
00:22:53,801 --> 00:22:54,700
I'll get you to turn here.

410
00:22:54,701 --> 00:22:57,390
This is the landmark I'm looking
for or probably the most,

411
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:00,160
most people look at use Google and like,
hey look,

412
00:23:00,161 --> 00:23:02,710
there's my house and get excited when
they see their car parked in front of

413
00:23:02,711 --> 00:23:05,890
something or their dog
or something. Um, for me,

414
00:23:05,891 --> 00:23:10,420
I use it all the time to do quick
accessibility spot checks. So I can,

415
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,490
if someone asked me a quick question,
I can go in,

416
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:15,460
look at it and street view and I
can give a rough idea of, you know,

417
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:18,730
what kind of barriers they might face.
If there's steps or something like that.

418
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,620
I use it on my own life as well.

419
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,750
And I'm looking for maybe like
a restaurant or something.

420
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,930
If there's no information
available on the website, I can uh,

421
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,870
go to the street view and I can
see, oh, oh, that's in the basement.

422
00:23:28,871 --> 00:23:31,960
I can't get in there. Or, oh, it's on the
first floor, I can get it, no problem.

423
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:37,120
And not need to worry about anymore a
remote desktop. As I mentioned before,

424
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:41,320
I, um, I have my helpers help
me and when I get into bed,

425
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,840
I'm not necessarily ready to sleep yet
and I still have some things I wanted to

426
00:23:43,841 --> 00:23:46,700
do, but because of the
schedules is from, um,

427
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:51,020
I can use Google chrome remote desktop
from my phone to keep working on my

428
00:23:51,021 --> 00:23:54,830
computer. So that's a unexpected thing.
I think probably for most people.

429
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:57,640
And I think a big thing coming
up is Google home and, uh,

430
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:00,620
the smart speaker and a
Iot devices in general,

431
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,800
I think it's going to be a very big game
changer for people with disabilities.

432
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:06,500
Uh, most of the commercials
except or about, you know,

433
00:24:06,501 --> 00:24:09,470
families getting up in the morning and
saying, you know, hey, turn on the TV.

434
00:24:09,471 --> 00:24:13,040
And everybody that gets excited about
that. But I think more important is that,

435
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:13,221
you know,

436
00:24:13,221 --> 00:24:17,390
somebody who can't move and can't use
their arms and legs very well can use that

437
00:24:17,391 --> 00:24:20,590
and they can live a more
fulfilling life without, uh,

438
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,090
as much need for other
people to help them out. Um,

439
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,870
I've dropped the remote control on my
TV at times when there's been no help

440
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,640
around it. I can't pick it up.
And, uh, thanks to my Chromecast,

441
00:24:31,641 --> 00:24:34,970
I can watch something else on TV
without having to worry about that.

442
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,120
So look for those unexpected use cases.

443
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:43,340
And since I have your undivided attention,
um, everybody, a dream list with me for,

444
00:24:43,341 --> 00:24:45,980
um,
for some Google products and mostly maps,

445
00:24:45,981 --> 00:24:49,730
I think because it has the biggest
impact for a lot of people's lives or at

446
00:24:49,731 --> 00:24:53,330
least for mine anyways,
uh, accessible exits. Uh,

447
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,990
right now I think I'm uh,
maps,

448
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,510
it will show you where the exits
are for train stations and subways,

449
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,920
but not necessarily which one
has the elevator edit. Um,

450
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,090
and I spent numerous,
um,

451
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,500
I mean it's of my day trying
to find which place has a,

452
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:11,870
an actual exit and that
doesn't come up sometimes.

453
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:16,160
And if it had that could really make
things a lot easier and smooth for

454
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,790
transfers or just going out and about,
um,

455
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:24,410
as well as a toilet. So this
is the last time I promise. Um,

456
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:27,950
there was an app that I used
to use called a check a toilet.

457
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:30,980
It's a Japanese sort of
crowdsourced a application.

458
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,380
And so people would use
the maps API and they'd,

459
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:37,710
they'd put pens down for where
they're accessible toilets and um,

460
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:42,230
they could share pictures and um,
information on them.

461
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,960
But because nobody's really
been updating it, it's sort of,

462
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:48,200
it's been depreciated so you
can't actually use it anymore. Um,

463
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:53,500
so it can be included into Google maps
somehow there where the nearest toilet,

464
00:25:53,521 --> 00:25:55,340
sorry.
Cause that it could help a lot of people.

465
00:25:55,341 --> 00:25:59,660
I think there's lost Twitter
thing, I promise. Um,

466
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:03,410
and accessible route option as well. Uh,
right now you can choose things like, um,

467
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:08,270
minimize transfers or minimize walking
distance if there is an option for

468
00:26:08,271 --> 00:26:10,130
accessible route a number of times.

469
00:26:10,131 --> 00:26:12,980
If he choose the walking path
and you come to a busy street,

470
00:26:12,981 --> 00:26:14,930
it'll go over the bridge
to cross the street.

471
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:17,660
And that's the path that
you're usually shown,

472
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:21,090
but of course that doesn't work for me.
So sometimes they're following the map,

473
00:26:21,091 --> 00:26:23,780
but all of a sudden, oh, there's a bunch
of steps I can't get over the other side.

474
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:27,530
So having some sort of accessible
route would be fantastic.

475
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,000
Accessible hotel rooms, whether
they have them or not. Um,

476
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,860
when you lit search and maps,
you know,

477
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:38,360
you choose a hotel and on the left hand
side it will show you a, for example,

478
00:26:38,361 --> 00:26:42,770
what the price ranges or the website,
the phone number, et cetera. And, uh,

479
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:47,670
lately I thank you very much for adding
accessible stations on for the train

480
00:26:47,671 --> 00:26:51,240
stations knows that if you have the
same thing for accessible hotels.

481
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:55,330
So I've had just an extra line that said,
accessible room available. Yes or no.

482
00:26:55,780 --> 00:27:00,120
That could definitely help a lot of
people searching for hotels and indoor

483
00:27:00,121 --> 00:27:00,591
mapping of course.

484
00:27:00,591 --> 00:27:04,830
And I'm sure it's something Google's
working on and could help for finding your

485
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:07,950
way around finding elevators
instead the stairs.

486
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:11,250
Cause a lot of times elevators are
buried way deep into different areas

487
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:17,970
and maybe possibly a bug bounties
for, uh, accessibility. Um,

488
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:19,950
if,
I'm not sure if you know,

489
00:27:19,951 --> 00:27:22,590
but in Japan there are a lot
of places called workshops.

490
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:25,680
So for people with different
disabilities that can't get regular jobs,

491
00:27:25,681 --> 00:27:30,300
maybe they work in these special workshops
where they'll maybe sort of bottle

492
00:27:30,301 --> 00:27:32,940
caps or they'll put
chopsticks into the holders,

493
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:37,050
etc. And it sort of a way to have people
with intellectual disabilities have a

494
00:27:37,051 --> 00:27:40,050
job. If they could maybe maybe
work team up with Google,

495
00:27:40,051 --> 00:27:44,520
it can be a good CSR opportunity to
maybe go and check the information that's

496
00:27:44,521 --> 00:27:48,690
been added to the local guides,
but whether it places accessible or not,

497
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:55,240
and it's finally, it's rumored that
accessibility benefits many, uh,

498
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,340
everybody maybe thinks that, oh, well it's
for a certain group of people, but, uh,

499
00:27:59,341 --> 00:27:59,611
you know,

500
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:02,760
if we all live along and if everybody's
going to become disabled in some way,

501
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:07,830
whether it's your eyesight gets bore or
your knees go out and you can't walk as

502
00:28:07,831 --> 00:28:12,060
far. And, um, I think
it's to be thought of,

503
00:28:12,061 --> 00:28:15,840
not as special money used on this
group, but as opposed to, um,

504
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,430
investment in your future. And that's why
accessibility is very important. Today.

505
00:28:20,431 --> 00:28:25,431
I was on the way and I transferred at
Morty Sta and in front of me in the

506
00:28:25,441 --> 00:28:25,741
elevator,

507
00:28:25,741 --> 00:28:29,970
there's an elderly couple and there's a
couple of mothers with baby strollers,

508
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,010
and there's people with injuries.

509
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:35,250
And those people are all using things
that were quote unquote designed for

510
00:28:35,251 --> 00:28:36,150
people with disabilities.

511
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:39,780
So it's important to remember that
accessibility is for everyone.

512
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,380
It's also for the person
delivering Pacu Been, uh,

513
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:45,420
they also appreciate the
slopes and the elevators.

514
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:50,580
And then finally,
a real dream request is,

515
00:28:50,581 --> 00:28:52,890
I know that you guys are trying to
get as much information on mapping,

516
00:28:52,891 --> 00:28:55,680
so if you need another Google car,
let me know.

517
00:28:55,681 --> 00:28:59,570
You can stop it on the back part and I
will gladly Gore ever. You want me to?

518
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:00,960
All right.
Thank you very much.

519
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:06,140
[inaudible].
