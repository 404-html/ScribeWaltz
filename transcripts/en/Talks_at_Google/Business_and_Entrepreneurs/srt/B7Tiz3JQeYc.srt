1
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:10,933
Thank you so much.

2
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:15,550
Sure. Dave. Uh, I'm not the man
of the hour though. These two are,

3
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,580
we have, uh, the founder
of ripple, Chris Larson,

4
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:22,120
and we have it's current CTO,
Stefan Thomas. Uh, we're very,

5
00:00:22,121 --> 00:00:24,730
very excited to have them.
This is going to be an awesome talk.

6
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:29,470
A little kind of brief intro. Chris
got his MBA from Stanford. He started,

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,540
he alone, which is a kind
of a mortgage lender, a,

8
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,940
it was actually the first platform to
freely give out fico credit scores to its

9
00:00:36,941 --> 00:00:39,400
users. Uh, he started prosper,

10
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:44,490
which is actually the first p to p peer
to peer lending marketplace in the u s

11
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:49,660
uh, and famously he cofounded ripple
labs, which is a subject of today's talk.

12
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:54,300
They're really excited to have Chris
here. Stefan Thomas is a Cto, uh,

13
00:00:54,301 --> 00:00:57,600
of ripple labs. Uh, he was the CTO of, uh,

14
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,750
numerous tech companies like e
load and tech bear. He founded, uh,

15
00:01:01,751 --> 00:01:05,620
we use coins which created this
kind of bit coin primer video,

16
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:10,330
which amassed 8 million views and was a
primer for a lot of people to just learn

17
00:01:10,331 --> 00:01:13,670
about kind of the basics of bitcoin.
And that kind of blew up on the web.

18
00:01:13,671 --> 00:01:17,320
So I'd check that out. Um, and
he's a board of directors. Uh,

19
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,820
he's on the board of directors,
sorry,

20
00:01:18,821 --> 00:01:22,210
at the js foundation and
he's a current CTO of ripple.

21
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,150
Ripple is, uh, describes itself as
the only enterprise solution, um,

22
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,980
uh, for blockchain. Uh, it allows
institutions to send money globally,

23
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,990
uh, and a fast, frictionless and
cheaper way. Uh, and it's broad.

24
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:42,640
It's kind of broader. Uh, eventual aim
is to create an, an Internet of value,

25
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,310
which I'm really excited to talk
to both of these guys about.

26
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,900
A so without further ado, please, uh,
give, give a hand for Chris and Stefan

27
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,100
[inaudible].

28
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,680
Awesome guys. Um, so, uh,

29
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,010
can you guys just give us kind of a
brief bio, uh, in, in your own words, uh,

30
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:06,580
your career and how you came to found
ripple labs and then get involved.

31
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,240
Great. A habit to you at, first of all,

32
00:02:08,241 --> 00:02:11,900
thanks for having us and thanks
for not making a Bart Simpson joke.

33
00:02:11,901 --> 00:02:15,380
I appreciate that. So, uh,
yeah, as you mentioned,

34
00:02:15,381 --> 00:02:18,440
we've been in Fintech for
about 20 years now, um,

35
00:02:18,441 --> 00:02:20,720
with kind of two startups previously.

36
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,240
He loaner prosper kind of
the common thread there.

37
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,090
Those were focused on the consumer ripple.

38
00:02:26,091 --> 00:02:28,610
Obviously it's focused on enterprise
and there's some learnings that I,

39
00:02:28,611 --> 00:02:31,130
that I had from that I'll share later.

40
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,190
But the idea there was using the
internet to democratize finance. Um,

41
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,510
I think we did a lot of good there.
Um,

42
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:42,020
but we were always limited by just a
fundamental lack of infrastructure in

43
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:46,420
Fintech. So kind of in my view, Fintech,
it really hasn't even started. Um,

44
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:51,050
it has sort of been a stepchild
of the internet boom, um,

45
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:56,080
because fintech really has to involve
both data and money and so far you've only

46
00:02:57,051 --> 00:03:01,690
had the ability to move data.
So there really both a lot of excitement,

47
00:03:01,691 --> 00:03:05,960
a lot of frustration that we couldn't
go further at the same time. Um,

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,400
it was always keeping an eye on what
was going on with virtual currencies.

49
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,570
And you know, Bitcoin, obviously
it was a real breakthrough,

50
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:15,490
but there've been a lot of
attempts over the years.

51
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:18,520
And so we were watching things
like, uh, Lyndon dollars,

52
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:23,350
which was currency and you know, uh,
that kind of existed in the early days.

53
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:25,990
Second life.
Phil Rossdale kind of an amazing guy.

54
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:28,900
He's still the coolest guy in
Crypto, right? Um, you know,

55
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:30,340
things like Vermont dollars,

56
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:33,430
kind of this idea of local
currencies in a very small community.

57
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:37,750
Super interesting. Um, obviously
beans and floors, which were too big,

58
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:41,940
well funded projects during the
first.com boom. That sort of, you know,

59
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,150
failed spectacularly,
but it just seemed like it was a matter,

60
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:49,990
a matter of time before you'd have
a global, a digital asset with no,

61
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:54,120
you know, kind of government
backing and no counterparty. Um,

62
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:58,810
as far as ripple itself, that route is
actually go back to about Oh four. Um,

63
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,950
there was, uh, something called the
ripple project created by a Ryan Fugger,

64
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,120
a Canadian,
a gentleman,

65
00:04:05,121 --> 00:04:10,121
and he was just really a neat guy and
he tried really to kind of give birth to

66
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:15,930
this idea of a peer to
peer. Um, platform for,

67
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:20,500
uh, people exchanging their own credit
and essentially their own currency.

68
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:24,670
Every person would have their own
currency. Super interesting concept. Um,

69
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:29,700
that was a big part of what influenced
us kind of fast forward to 2011 and there

70
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:33,970
was these three geniuses that
got together. Um, Arthur Breteau,

71
00:04:33,971 --> 00:04:37,070
Jed McCaleb and David Schwartz.
Um,

72
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,000
and this is of course after bitcoin
was created a couple of years earlier.

73
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:42,370
They were fascinated by what bitcoin did,

74
00:04:42,371 --> 00:04:46,180
but they were frustrated by the enormous
waste of energy that is sort of at the

75
00:04:46,181 --> 00:04:49,720
heart of mining. That's a core
part of, of, uh, of bitcoin.

76
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:54,070
So they set out to build a more efficient
consensus algorithm and they came up

77
00:04:54,071 --> 00:04:55,880
with something really beautiful.
Um,

78
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,230
they also were inspired by what Ryan
figurehead head down at the ripple project

79
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:04,620
and kind of also brought in that idea of
kind of pathfinding algorithms so that

80
00:05:04,661 --> 00:05:09,661
anything of value can be exchanged
along with that digital asset to really,

81
00:05:09,731 --> 00:05:13,480
I think that was kind of the, the, the,
the birth point of this Internet of value,

82
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,630
the intellectual protocol, which we'll
show in a little bit. Um, actually has,

83
00:05:17,631 --> 00:05:21,830
it's almost like an overlay protocol over
blockchains but then also traditional

84
00:05:21,831 --> 00:05:25,610
financial systems and that allows you
to innovate in different parts of the

85
00:05:25,611 --> 00:05:29,390
network independently instead of having
the sort of central governance model

86
00:05:29,391 --> 00:05:32,630
where everyone has to agree to any,
any rule changes that are happening.

87
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:34,760
I think this is like a critical point.

88
00:05:34,761 --> 00:05:38,840
I think we came to the realization that
a blockchain was not going to be the

89
00:05:38,841 --> 00:05:43,280
solution to the biggest problem we think
the world has right now in this whole

90
00:05:43,281 --> 00:05:48,280
Fintech area, which is there is no
Internet of value. Um, and why block,

91
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:48,530
you know,

92
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,980
and a lot of people talking
about bitcoin's going to be
a new protocol for money.

93
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:55,450
Well, just it's really a
database, right? So it,

94
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,300
a single database or a single network
cannot be the network of networks.

95
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:03,490
And so that was kind of the big flaw and
that's what led to, I think, you know,

96
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:07,790
Stefan having this kind of Aha moment
of need for something like Ilp,

97
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,510
which was a dangerous moment for,
it was scary at first.

98
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:14,160
It was like we were trying, we were out
there promoting this acid, like Xrp,

99
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,670
like telling everyone, hey, you should
put all your balances on this ledger.

100
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,960
You should do all your transactions
through this one system. Um,

101
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,320
and we knew the friction from that.
But then again,

102
00:06:23,321 --> 00:06:25,390
like stepping back from that
and suddenly saying like, oh,

103
00:06:25,391 --> 00:06:29,370
they're going to be many systems was
very scary. And so we actually, uh,

104
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:33,790
waited almost a year to publish the
white paper until we had, um, you know,

105
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:38,200
in our minds of result of strategy around
what's extra p his role in this new

106
00:06:38,201 --> 00:06:42,910
world and how do we make sure that our
technologies are still needed and it's

107
00:06:42,911 --> 00:06:45,850
still necessary and can,
can benefit this new world.

108
00:06:45,851 --> 00:06:49,240
Like how do we re architect everything
to serve this new world? Um,

109
00:06:49,241 --> 00:06:52,390
so I think we're still in the process
of like rolling out all of the different

110
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:57,160
pieces. Um, but it was that sort of
one year period from, I would say, um,

111
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,180
you know,

112
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:02,650
mid 2014 when we first had
that realization to October,

113
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,390
2015 when the white paper
for intellectual came out,

114
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,180
where we tried to kind of
put all the pieces in place
for it because we have rip,

115
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,420
it always was different from big

116
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,700
going in that you could put
anything of value in it, right?

117
00:07:11,701 --> 00:07:15,210
So this idea of kind of,
we'd call it IOUs or balances,

118
00:07:15,211 --> 00:07:19,560
but really being value agnostic
and that then being the engine for,

119
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:22,630
for the exchange of that thing of value.
Um,

120
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,610
but having the combination of IOP
with Xrp, we think that's the,

121
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,830
that's kind of the,
the killer formula.

122
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,840
No, you can have any type of
failure like any currency,

123
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,410
but also any type of ledger. So like
anything from a centralized ledger to

124
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,090
chain, et cetera. And if we look
at kind of stepping way back,

125
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:41,240
kind of the macro problem that we
think in the world has this lack of an

126
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:43,600
Internet of value. Um, you know,

127
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:46,940
you kind of argue that this gets to the
heart of the problem with globalization,

128
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,070
which is obviously under a
lot of stress today, right?

129
00:07:49,071 --> 00:07:51,740
It's kind of not working for a
lot of people and we kind of,

130
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,150
we don't think of it as like, well,
globalization's bad. We think of it.

131
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:58,430
Globalization is actually incomplete.
Until you have an Internet of value,

132
00:07:58,431 --> 00:08:00,020
you really can't have true globalization.

133
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:04,040
You sort of need these three core
interoperability technologies working

134
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:08,780
altogether. You need interoperability
of data, of goods and money, right?

135
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:12,680
So the world today, of course has
interoperability of data. You know,

136
00:08:12,681 --> 00:08:15,200
it's completely transformed the
world over the last 20 years.

137
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,460
It has interoperability and goods through,
you know,

138
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:21,530
a simple thing called the shipping
container, which you know,

139
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:26,060
before that was in vantage shipping stuff
was incredibly inefficient and labor

140
00:08:26,061 --> 00:08:29,420
intensive stuff would arrive at one point
I had to be ripped apart and reshipped

141
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,750
and with a shipping container, you
know, your shipped to train the truck,

142
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:36,710
any port in the world, you have
interoperability goods since the 1950s.

143
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,410
That's Sorta what an Internet of value is.

144
00:08:39,411 --> 00:08:43,640
It's like the shipping
container for value. And again,
that can't be a blockchain.

145
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:47,000
And blockchain is like a single
shipping company that will, you know,

146
00:08:47,001 --> 00:08:49,850
you'll max out that shipping company and
you'll have a dependency on that one.

147
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:53,750
Shipping Company, shipping container, you
can create endless shipping containers.

148
00:08:53,751 --> 00:08:57,110
It has no effect on any other
shipping containers that deployed.

149
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,120
That's sort of what Ilp is almost
the ultimate decentralization.

150
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,400
So that's kind of what we're,
how we're thinking about it

151
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:05,010
or the technique people in the
audience as a stateless protocol.

152
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:09,540
So you can literally just run it over
different systems so it doesn't keep any

153
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:10,374
balances,
et cetera.

154
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,070
And then we think we're really good
things happen when the world finally has a

155
00:09:13,071 --> 00:09:17,460
full kind of globalization platform.
Um,

156
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,640
but this has to happen. And, and again,

157
00:09:19,641 --> 00:09:22,740
what w what does this meeting now that
we don't have it right now? It means, uh,

158
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,930
you know, we all know, send him 50 bucks
to Europe is kind of impossible, right?

159
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,340
Yeah. Um, we know,

160
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,640
I think the example of the air bnb host
in Tanzania who should be making 29

161
00:09:35,031 --> 00:09:39,170
bucks to on a rental. And by the end
of the day is nine bucks is showing up.

162
00:09:39,171 --> 00:09:42,050
This is an actual example,
right? Um, so that's a,

163
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,490
that's a problem with relatively big
amounts of value. Think about, uh,

164
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,780
the 2 billion people in
the developing world. They,

165
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,100
the gates foundation would say they
need to be able to send 50 cents, uh,

166
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:56,450
to be real participants in the global
economy. Take that even further.

167
00:09:56,451 --> 00:10:01,451
If you think about all the connected
devices and applications that probably

168
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:04,910
should be empowered to sand value,
that might need to be, you know,

169
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,720
a thousandth of a penny a,

170
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,600
that's just not possible until you
had this internet or value in place.

171
00:10:10,601 --> 00:10:13,370
So the world is being held back by
this and we think that's the true

172
00:10:13,371 --> 00:10:15,500
breakthrough that this whole,

173
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:18,380
whatever you want to call this
industry really is all about.

174
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,490
There are some detractors of,

175
00:10:21,491 --> 00:10:26,030
of ripple that say it's kind of the
centralized block chain or the enterprise

176
00:10:26,031 --> 00:10:28,640
blockchain. Uh, you know,

177
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:32,690
a lot of bitcoin loyalists and bitcoin
in general might have come out of kind of

178
00:10:32,691 --> 00:10:32,930
a,

179
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:37,930
an anarchist or a cipher punk kind
of movement early on as part of that.

180
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,220
Uh, um, and uh, and so that, that's
kind of the general criticism.

181
00:10:43,221 --> 00:10:46,190
So I wanted to give you guys a chance
to respond to that and then I'll combine

182
00:10:46,191 --> 00:10:47,290
the second question because Stefan,

183
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,680
as an awesome presentation he's going
to give the second question is we are

184
00:10:51,681 --> 00:10:55,370
living in a crazy kind of environment
in terms of crypto currency.

185
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,990
Just speculation on, on the price
of, of, of Tokens and blockchains.

186
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,220
Uh, what do you guys think? We're
in 1999 right now. Is this the, the,

187
00:11:05,221 --> 00:11:09,110
the uh, you know, kind of a.com bubble
that we're experiencing? Um, so yeah,

188
00:11:09,111 --> 00:11:09,944
those two.
Yeah,

189
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,270
I'll take the first one. You
can. Sure. Um, so first of all,

190
00:11:14,271 --> 00:11:15,920
the enterprise part I
take as a compliment.

191
00:11:15,921 --> 00:11:19,070
I think that's precisely what we're
trying to do is we're trying to build the

192
00:11:19,071 --> 00:11:23,540
first blockchain that can actually be
used for real, you know, real use cases.

193
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:26,990
You know, like when you think
of any distributed system,

194
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,520
we need to take a
distributed systems class.

195
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,780
The first thing your
professor will tell you,

196
00:11:29,781 --> 00:11:32,400
it's like your distributed system is still
only going to be as good as the nodes

197
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:34,760
that runs on.
And so if you think of bitcoin miners,

198
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:38,240
they're only incentivized to basically
hash as efficiently as possible.

199
00:11:38,241 --> 00:11:41,750
They're not incentivized to provide
physical security for the data centers.

200
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:45,830
They're not incentivized to make decisions
in the interest of the network. Um,

201
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:46,390
so the,
the,

202
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:50,550
they have a very pure incentive to just
hash as much as possible get paid, um,

203
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:53,530
rinse and repeat.
In the case of ripples,

204
00:11:53,531 --> 00:11:57,340
since the validators are chosen by
the users. If a validater for example,

205
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:00,220
votes against a block size
increase or something like that,

206
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:02,390
if there were an issue in, in ripple, um,

207
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:07,130
then you would eventually find that
users would no longer add that validated

208
00:12:07,131 --> 00:12:10,120
should that list. And so that validated
would slowly lose influence. Um,

209
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:14,840
and so it's not as much of a system
that's like tailored to users like bitcoin

210
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:18,910
is where, you know, anyone can just run a
node and it just auto configures itself,

211
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,870
um, connects to the network. You do have
to do that validators selection manually.

212
00:12:22,871 --> 00:12:25,630
You have to think about, you
know, politically speaking, like,

213
00:12:25,631 --> 00:12:28,810
which validators do you want to
empower with your note, et Cetera. Um,

214
00:12:28,811 --> 00:12:32,830
so it is more targeted at like, you know,
actively being managed by companies,

215
00:12:32,831 --> 00:12:34,240
things like that,
things of that nature.

216
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,810
But I think the reason that that makes a
lot of senses because when you actually

217
00:12:37,811 --> 00:12:41,310
go out there and to the market, um, you
know, the, the evil people, you know,

218
00:12:41,311 --> 00:12:45,700
you mentioned I'm an anarchist,
you know, so I, I really
want to, uh, empower people,

219
00:12:45,701 --> 00:12:49,870
right? But the people that
you got to fight or not the,
like all the banks there,

220
00:12:49,871 --> 00:12:54,220
there a few, you know, very, very
powerful players in the market that,

221
00:12:54,221 --> 00:12:55,690
that sort of take a
little bit off the top.

222
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,600
And those are the people that you want
to bypass. And then everyone else,

223
00:12:58,601 --> 00:13:01,720
like there's a lot of small banks and
regional banks and so on that we've talked

224
00:13:01,721 --> 00:13:05,230
to that are really trying to
provide better user experience.

225
00:13:05,231 --> 00:13:07,360
You're really trying to
provide lower fees, et cetera.

226
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,660
Those are the companies that we want to
work with and empower and it's not just

227
00:13:10,661 --> 00:13:14,320
banks, it's payment providers, mobile
money providers, um, and so on.

228
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,050
So that's kind of where that
different approach comes from.

229
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:18,640
And on the centralization point,

230
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:20,980
I would kind of say that there are
a lot of different definitions of

231
00:13:20,981 --> 00:13:22,450
centralization and you know,

232
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:25,360
we're sort of going down the list of
meeting more and more of them as we

233
00:13:25,361 --> 00:13:26,690
progress.
Um,

234
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:31,630
one of the ones that we don't meet yet
is that we still run a majority of the

235
00:13:31,631 --> 00:13:34,870
trusted validators. Um, but
that's something that we're,

236
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:38,460
this year going to start
rolling out in terms of, um,

237
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,990
we have already got a lot of
third party validators running,

238
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,700
so people are going to start
trusting in this year. Um,

239
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,230
and so this just one more step
to kind of go in that direction.

240
00:13:47,231 --> 00:13:51,550
And I think if I compare it to where we
were with Bitcoin, like with Bitcoin,

241
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,910
we had some level of decentralization.
Again, meeting some of the definitions,

242
00:13:54,911 --> 00:13:57,610
but not all. For instance,
there's no geographic diversity.

243
00:13:57,611 --> 00:14:00,370
It's very concentrated in China right now.
Um,

244
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,940
but we didn't have a very good roadmap
in order to how to overcome that because

245
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:06,720
the, the system is really, um, you know,

246
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:08,890
it's just sort of the incessant
centers are set up in a, in a,

247
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,890
I would now say bad way.
Um,

248
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:13,900
whereas with ripple we have
the incentives are in order.

249
00:14:13,901 --> 00:14:17,390
And so it's just a matter of like, you
know, validators having the riot, the,

250
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:17,711
you know,

251
00:14:17,711 --> 00:14:20,860
amount of operational histories of people
who actually start trusting them and

252
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:24,100
us having enough confidence in the
software to actually, um, you know,

253
00:14:24,101 --> 00:14:28,720
continuously let go of more and more of
the reigns here. So I think it's, uh, uh,

254
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,171
for ripple,

255
00:14:29,171 --> 00:14:32,830
it's a clearer roadmap to get to a
very high level of decentralization.

256
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:37,850
So bottom line in decentralization
is there's kind of a bright line,

257
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:43,000
you know, if rebel did not exist with
the network, continue to function. Yes.

258
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,930
So that's kind of that, you know,
hard line of which side you're on.

259
00:14:46,931 --> 00:14:49,520
And then I think it's
definitely point variety.

260
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,890
We can agree deviations from there.
And then

261
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,800
a second I think on what's going on in
the market today. So obviously, you know,

262
00:14:56,801 --> 00:14:59,630
it really interesting, you know,
the time in, in, in the space,

263
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:04,010
clearly there is a lot of UB
speculative interest that's going on.

264
00:15:04,011 --> 00:15:08,580
And I kind of break that into
kind of two parts. Um, one, uh,

265
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:13,400
is there's clearly a lot of, of almost
like crypto day trading going on.

266
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:17,150
It's almost like the days of the early
Internet with all the, the day trading.

267
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,261
And I think it'd be probably,

268
00:15:18,261 --> 00:15:22,930
if you look back on most people that
were day trading back in 2000, um,

269
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,270
I bet it didn't work out that well for,
for people that were doing that.

270
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:29,440
People shouldn't do that. You
could lose all the, you know,

271
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:32,780
you can lose everything. Um,
it's, it's just not a good plan.

272
00:15:32,781 --> 00:15:36,260
People should not be putting the
retirement money to work day trading

273
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:40,530
cryptocurrencies. And then I think there's
a lot of skepticism that you, you know,

274
00:15:40,531 --> 00:15:44,930
you see out there, uh, Nathaniel popper,
for example, the New York Times, you know,

275
00:15:44,931 --> 00:15:49,070
he writes, uh, uh, about
that, uh, skeptically and
he's right to be skeptical.

276
00:15:49,071 --> 00:15:51,770
So we think, you know, that people
should be very careful with that.

277
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:54,890
But there's a second part of speculation
I think is being now increasingly

278
00:15:54,891 --> 00:15:58,100
driven by institutions.
So institutions, funds,

279
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,430
we would call it the Wall Street
tidal wave is sorta coming, uh,

280
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,800
coming into play here.

281
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:08,060
And I think what's going on there is that
a very sophisticated people are saying,

282
00:16:08,061 --> 00:16:09,950
investors are saying,
look,

283
00:16:09,951 --> 00:16:13,790
there's some meaningful percentage of
this is in fact a second internet and this

284
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:17,210
internet or value can be as
transfer transformational.

285
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:21,500
That's a longer term sort of call
that that's going to happen. Um,

286
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:24,110
so I'd say that's more
constructive speculation.

287
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:27,920
And I think those institutions
and those kinds of professionals,

288
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:31,820
they've seen what's happened in
this last, uh, 20 years of the net.

289
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:37,150
The great promise, the overhype,
uh, the, the, you know,

290
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,170
the total bubble,
the crash,

291
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,100
and then kind of fast forward 20 years
where we are today. If you look back,

292
00:16:43,101 --> 00:16:46,760
you'd probably say probably
the early promise was probably,

293
00:16:46,761 --> 00:16:51,380
it was probably under hyped given the
impact that all of this has had on human

294
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,250
existence. So that's a more
constructive, uh, view.

295
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,830
I think they use cases for industries,

296
00:16:57,831 --> 00:17:02,831
enterprise payment providers and
other things that is coming on board.

297
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:03,861
Um,

298
00:17:03,861 --> 00:17:08,410
so I suspect that sort of ratio of sort
of hopefully the longterm specularity of

299
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,050
injury, you know,
activity and the use case,

300
00:17:11,051 --> 00:17:14,260
it starts to look more like what you see
in normal markets because this thing's

301
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,980
gonna actually work pretty
constructively together.

302
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:21,250
When was the last point in that I think
interesting is in the first internet

303
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,030
that kind of started with institutions,

304
00:17:23,031 --> 00:17:26,990
vcs and then Wall Street and then kind
of went on to sort of this day trader,

305
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:27,591
you know,

306
00:17:27,591 --> 00:17:30,590
dynamic that you saw this kind of the
reverse of that actually kind of started

307
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:34,190
with individuals and now the
institutional wave is coming on board.

308
00:17:34,191 --> 00:17:37,410
So that's a little bit different,
uh, you know, kind of flavor. Um,

309
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,740
but definitely think the world's
never seen anything like this before.

310
00:17:39,741 --> 00:17:42,080
So it's trying to grapple like what,
what are the metrics,

311
00:17:42,081 --> 00:17:44,810
what is it you compare to visa,
you gold?

312
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,650
Is that the first protocol that can
be monetized? Lots of new questions.

313
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,070
Awesome guys.

314
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,900
Really appreciate it. Stefan's
now going to give, uh,

315
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:56,220
an awesome presentation about what's in
store on the technical side for ripple.

316
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,230
And then Chris Christmas
going to stay here.

317
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,540
Someone's going to come back and we're
going to do a little Q and a with the

318
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:03,210
audience,
so take it away.

319
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,600
So what this is trying to illustrate is,
um,

320
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,780
if you deploy into ledger on some network,

321
00:18:08,781 --> 00:18:12,980
and we envisioned that there will probably
be sort of a global instance of it.

322
00:18:12,981 --> 00:18:16,080
Lists like the Internet
has a global instance. Um,

323
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,740
then you have these different nodes,
these,

324
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:22,460
these little blue notes here
and we call them connectors,

325
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:24,500
but they're basically like routers in Ip.

326
00:18:24,501 --> 00:18:26,960
So they basically taken
packets on one side.

327
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:30,740
They look at the destination
on the packet, they compare
it to the routing table,

328
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,860
and then they forward that
packet towards that destination.

329
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,010
Whenever you look at any kind
of blockchain presentation,

330
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,750
there's a pretty good chance you'll see
some kind of graphic that has, you know,

331
00:18:41,751 --> 00:18:46,630
nodes connected by lines. Um,
some kind of graph and, uh,

332
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:50,120
you know, you'll hear things like
bitcoin is the TCP Ip of money.

333
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,280
And when we hear that,

334
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:56,570
we cringe a little bit because if you
know anything about how TCP IP works and

335
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:57,740
how bitcoin works,

336
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,610
there are very different protocols
that do very different things in a very

337
00:19:01,611 --> 00:19:02,990
different way.
Um,

338
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:06,350
and so the challenge that we always have
when we talk about the interledger is

339
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:10,700
it is actually a lot like TCP Ip in and
then through this little presentation,

340
00:19:10,701 --> 00:19:15,020
I want to try to convince you as to
why I say that. Um, but, uh, you know,

341
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:18,830
people already have usually like seeing
some kind of blockchain presentation had

342
00:19:18,831 --> 00:19:21,140
already looks a lot like this, um, but,

343
00:19:21,141 --> 00:19:25,510
but is a little bit more superficial
in terms of the similarities. Um,

344
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,520
and so if I want to send a
packet into this network,

345
00:19:28,521 --> 00:19:33,080
I just send it to whichever connected
I'm connected to and it should find its

346
00:19:33,081 --> 00:19:36,740
way to whatever receiver receiver
I've put on it. So in that way,

347
00:19:36,741 --> 00:19:40,130
it's a lot like two CPIP.
Now you might say, okay,

348
00:19:40,131 --> 00:19:44,600
so you were routing these packets, but
how does actual money really move? Um,

349
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,880
so the way that that works is
that once you have sort of a,

350
00:19:47,881 --> 00:19:49,790
a path and you're sending these packets,

351
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:55,370
each link is responsible for
its own settlement. Um, so
what we tend to do is, um,

352
00:19:55,371 --> 00:19:58,700
if you have two connectors that have,
um,

353
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:00,740
a peering relationship with each other,

354
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:04,370
they're going to have this like pay
packet traffic going back and forth.

355
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,770
And so they're going to look at those
packets and then they're going to

356
00:20:06,771 --> 00:20:10,370
eventually settle. Um, and
for the core of the network,

357
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,740
it makes the most sense to
settle through a digital asset.

358
00:20:12,741 --> 00:20:16,640
And the reason for that is that they
are very easy to move internationally

359
00:20:16,641 --> 00:20:21,350
across borders and you have very low
costs in terms of when you move them.

360
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,650
Um, and since you are going to have a
lot of inbound and outbound traffic,

361
00:20:24,651 --> 00:20:29,180
it's makes sense to stay in that digital
asset, to do all of your settlements. Um,

362
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:31,640
but of course the majority of,
of people,

363
00:20:31,641 --> 00:20:35,690
users out there don't actually have
easy access to digital assets yet. Um,

364
00:20:35,691 --> 00:20:37,640
and so you do need some kind of a,

365
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:40,940
some form of support for
traditional payment systems.

366
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:45,080
And the interesting thing is that all
these settlement networks really do is,

367
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:49,240
you know, move payments across
or like move money. And so, um,

368
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:52,270
that's something that is supported
by all the legacy payment networks.

369
00:20:52,271 --> 00:20:52,651
So we will,

370
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:56,260
we can actually do is we can just
aggregate to a greater degree so we wait a

371
00:20:56,261 --> 00:21:00,490
little bit longer before we settle. Um,
and then we send a one big payment across.

372
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,950
You see that kind of at the
beginning here with the sender,

373
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:07,120
a down there and the receiver
and upright, um, where those,

374
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,270
those settlements are happening a little
less frequently and there are a little

375
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,280
bit bigger and to probably
a little bit more expensive,

376
00:21:12,281 --> 00:21:15,670
but they can settle lots and lots
of these individual packets. Um,

377
00:21:15,671 --> 00:21:17,050
and so with this architecture,

378
00:21:17,051 --> 00:21:19,900
what that means is that from
an end to end perspective,

379
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:24,400
we can send a packet at incredibly
low latency. We can send it,

380
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,940
I'm an incredibly low incremental cost.

381
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,950
And so that's really what makes
it feel a lot like the internet.

382
00:21:29,951 --> 00:21:33,700
You can really just connect to lots of
different services and pay for lots of

383
00:21:33,701 --> 00:21:36,970
different things without accumulating
a lot of fees while doing that.

384
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:39,630
And then sure, it has a settlement
eventually. And you know,

385
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,210
hopefully these a last mile sort of
settlements will get more efficient.

386
00:21:43,211 --> 00:21:47,620
Just like internet connectivity. It
went from you know, 56 k modems, uh,

387
00:21:47,621 --> 00:21:50,830
all the way up to what we have
now where I have a Google fiber.

388
00:21:50,831 --> 00:21:55,300
So very happy with that.
Um,

389
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,800
so yeah,

390
00:21:56,801 --> 00:22:01,000
here's a little chart of like the
actual architecture and again,

391
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:03,240
if you're familiar with TCP Ip,
you know,

392
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:07,480
they draw the same kind of picture with
the four layers, um, which is, you know,

393
00:22:07,481 --> 00:22:08,980
sometimes called the
Internet architecture.

394
00:22:08,981 --> 00:22:11,890
It's a little bit less detailed
than the Osi architecture,

395
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,090
but I won't bore you with that.

396
00:22:13,091 --> 00:22:16,240
It's just a reference for the
people that didn't know that. Um,

397
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:21,070
so the four layers actually work a lot
similar to the very similarly to the four

398
00:22:21,071 --> 00:22:22,300
layers and TCP Ip.

399
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:25,930
So I just want to go through those four
and kind of give you a sense of how this

400
00:22:25,931 --> 00:22:27,270
all works together.
Um,

401
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:31,000
the way you should think about the
interledger layer is that's essentially an

402
00:22:31,001 --> 00:22:32,020
abstraction layer.

403
00:22:32,021 --> 00:22:35,710
So that's basically the thing that you
have all the different ways of moving

404
00:22:35,711 --> 00:22:36,580
money below it.

405
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:39,970
And then you have all the different use
cases for moving money above it and it

406
00:22:39,971 --> 00:22:42,910
kind of brings them all together.
So in the case of the Internet,

407
00:22:42,911 --> 00:22:45,700
it would be the internet layer,
um,

408
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,000
has all the different ways of moving
information below it and all the different

409
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:50,440
use cases building on top of it.

410
00:22:50,441 --> 00:22:52,780
And so now you can have all
these different combinations.

411
00:22:52,781 --> 00:22:55,870
I can make a Skype call over my
Wifi, I can make a, you know,

412
00:22:55,871 --> 00:22:57,700
send an email over my satellite internet.

413
00:22:57,701 --> 00:23:01,750
So it really doesn't matter what use
case I'm using and which network I'm on,

414
00:23:01,751 --> 00:23:03,160
I can combine them in different ways.

415
00:23:03,161 --> 00:23:07,510
And so this is kind of doing the
same thing, uh, for money. Okay.

416
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,380
Now an application layer,
uh,

417
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:12,130
this would be sort of the
equivalent of like http SMTP.

418
00:23:12,131 --> 00:23:13,600
This is use case specific.

419
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:17,610
You would make different application layer
protocols for different use cases. Um,

420
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:22,310
so one that we've designed so far is
called a SPSP or a simple payments,

421
00:23:22,311 --> 00:23:23,820
separate set up protocol.
Um,

422
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:27,000
and basically all that does
is it defines what a internet,

423
00:23:27,001 --> 00:23:30,470
it sort of identify it looks like. So
think of that like an email address. Um,

424
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:34,750
and you could send to that
type of identifier if you
wanted to pay somebody as

425
00:23:34,751 --> 00:23:38,080
on a peer to peer basis or you
could build that into simple apps.

426
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,430
It's not super efficient.

427
00:23:39,431 --> 00:23:43,540
So it's kind of like HDP or it's sort
of the general purpose application layer

428
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:47,090
protocol. Um, you could make a much
more specialized ones. So for instance,

429
00:23:47,091 --> 00:23:51,710
we did an experiment where we built
payments into web torrent. Um,

430
00:23:51,711 --> 00:23:56,370
so basically to pay the uploaders,
um, but also the content creators, uh,

431
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:58,250
which I think is really
cool aspect of this.

432
00:23:58,251 --> 00:24:02,000
It's like it's efficient enough that you
can pay a lot of different parties in

433
00:24:02,001 --> 00:24:04,970
the flow of whatever app or interaction
that you're, you're part of.

434
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:06,470
And we'll see a demo of that in a bit.

435
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:11,150
But I think this is where I expect a lot
of variety is on the application layer.

436
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:15,570
Now we're talk about the transport layer.
So if you're familiar with TCPI,

437
00:24:15,571 --> 00:24:16,010
if he does this,

438
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:20,180
where you find your TCP and TCP is
really common to a lot of different

439
00:24:20,181 --> 00:24:22,040
application layer
protocols that build on it.

440
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,950
And it gives you some sort
of basic services, right?

441
00:24:24,951 --> 00:24:29,210
It gives you a sequencing of packets so
that your data comes out the right order.

442
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,150
Um, it gives you a retransmission
if a packet gets lost,

443
00:24:32,151 --> 00:24:33,950
it'll send it again and so on.

444
00:24:33,951 --> 00:24:37,430
And we have a transport layer
protocol called PSK too.

445
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,080
And it does a lot of the same things.

446
00:24:39,081 --> 00:24:42,200
It's a responsible for doing things
like if you send a large payment,

447
00:24:42,201 --> 00:24:44,660
it'll split it into smaller
chunks and then reassemble them.

448
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,860
It'll do things like retransmission
of payment packets, et cetera. Um,

449
00:24:48,861 --> 00:24:51,410
so again,
like I'm trying to really get across,

450
00:24:51,411 --> 00:24:55,610
like we're copying from the Internet
a lot and we have to um, give, uh,

451
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,600
give them a lot of credit,

452
00:24:56,601 --> 00:24:59,390
cause a lot of the things that they
do actually apply to money very well.

453
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,520
Now the interledger layer is,
um,

454
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,450
is kind of an interesting one because
that's where all the routing happens.

455
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:06,890
And when we first started out,

456
00:25:06,891 --> 00:25:09,800
I'll tell you one anecdote
about the design of this layer,

457
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:11,660
which is when we first started out,

458
00:25:11,661 --> 00:25:14,200
we assume that the writing would have
to be quite different because we're

459
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:17,970
talking about money after all, we're
not talking about information. Um,

460
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,850
and so we,
you know,

461
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:23,180
we knew about BGP and how it
works and so on what we thought,

462
00:25:23,181 --> 00:25:24,710
a lot of those things
wouldn't be applicable.

463
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:27,980
We want it to route by
the lowest cost path.

464
00:25:27,981 --> 00:25:31,160
We thought that that was the
most important thing was,
was to minimize the fees.

465
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:36,530
But as we actually building
it, we realized that, um,
if you optimize by fees,

466
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:40,160
what can happen is somebody in the
network just advertises a absurd, right?

467
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,300
So they just advertise,
hey,

468
00:25:41,301 --> 00:25:45,800
I can exchange $1 for 600 euros now
that suddenly the best path to take for

469
00:25:45,801 --> 00:25:47,840
absolutely every payment
in the entire network.

470
00:25:47,841 --> 00:25:50,480
Now what do you think is going to happen?
So that note's going to go down,

471
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,960
obviously that right was never real
to begin with. Um, and so you just,

472
00:25:53,961 --> 00:25:55,880
the whole thing just breaks down.
Um,

473
00:25:55,910 --> 00:26:00,910
and so one of the reasons for the way the
BGP is design is to make the length of

474
00:26:01,011 --> 00:26:02,750
the path one of the primary metrics.

475
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,590
And what that does is if someone
advertises some ridiculous metrics,

476
00:26:06,591 --> 00:26:09,770
you still only going to take down his
immediate neighborhood because for

477
00:26:09,771 --> 00:26:11,990
everyone else is still going
to look like a big detour,

478
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,690
a very long path that they
don't want to take. Um,

479
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:18,850
and so it turns out that even for money,
the length of the path,

480
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:21,650
it's a very good proxy for all the
other things you might be interested in.

481
00:26:21,651 --> 00:26:24,380
Like how reliable is it, what's
the latency, what's the fees?

482
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:27,530
Those are all lower or tend
to be lower for shorter paths.

483
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:31,580
And so we can do exactly what BGP does
in terms of routing by shortest path

484
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,420
first.

485
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:36,500
And then I'm using other metrics to kind
of tie break if passengers same length,

486
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,670
um, picking the best one. Um, and we
just basically add fee is another metric.

487
00:26:40,671 --> 00:26:43,040
Just like the incident has latency.
Um,

488
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,910
I already kind of talked a
little bit about the settlement.

489
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,240
The key thing to mention here is that
all we need from the settlement layers

490
00:26:48,241 --> 00:26:51,000
that it can transmit money.
It doesn't have to be very fast.

491
00:26:51,001 --> 00:26:55,320
It doesn't have to be very cheap. If it's
slower, we just settled less often. Um,

492
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:58,140
and just to give you some examples of
the kinds of things we've integrated with

493
00:26:58,141 --> 00:27:00,900
already, um, there's a
extra p patient plugin,

494
00:27:00,901 --> 00:27:03,150
so that's settling using the extra ledger.

495
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,250
Let's see it most efficient
at plugin right now.

496
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:08,250
That's one of the reasons that
we feel good about the strategy.

497
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:12,480
It's like we actually seeing in practice
that our own products score really well

498
00:27:12,481 --> 00:27:14,310
on these different metrics.

499
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,670
In terms of like what ledger would you
actually choose for settlement? Um,

500
00:27:17,671 --> 00:27:19,260
we've done a lightening integration,

501
00:27:19,261 --> 00:27:22,350
so we did a little test where we
actually connected the bitcoin lightening

502
00:27:22,351 --> 00:27:24,780
network and the light coin
lightening network together.

503
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,010
If you're not familiar with lighting,

504
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:30,660
it's basically a scalability overlay
network for, uh, currencies like bitcoin.

505
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,160
And then you could do something like Ach.
You can even do cash if you want, right?

506
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,790
So you can have a relationship with an
intellectual service provider where it

507
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:41,220
basically says like,
I give you cash up ahead of time,

508
00:27:41,221 --> 00:27:44,760
or you give me cash ahead of time and
then we can exchange packets up to that

509
00:27:44,761 --> 00:27:47,140
amount until we reached that
balance. And then, you know,

510
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,930
we have to settle up again.
Okay. Now with all that, um,

511
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:52,523
prefix,

512
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,920
I'm going to give you a bit of a live
demo and this is going to go fairly quick.

513
00:27:55,921 --> 00:27:59,690
So pay attention. Um, so, uh,

514
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:04,050
basically what we're going to show here
is, uh, the easy website maker. Okay.

515
00:28:04,051 --> 00:28:06,950
So easy website maker is an
APP that somebody put together,

516
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:08,370
just uploaded it to get hub.

517
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:12,780
And basically it allows you to create a
website from just having a little sketch.

518
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:16,500
And now obviously we didn't
build all the difficult parts,

519
00:28:16,501 --> 00:28:20,640
the AI parts of what that's what
you guys are for. Um, but, uh,

520
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:22,140
we did do all the payment stuff,

521
00:28:22,141 --> 00:28:24,150
so all the payments are actually
going through until ledger.

522
00:28:24,151 --> 00:28:26,040
There's actual payment
packets being exchanged.

523
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,680
And we tried to visualize that a little
bit later by having like a log of

524
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,910
packets. Um, and basically
what this APP does,

525
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:35,070
this I put in a sketch and it,

526
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:38,850
it goes to one vendor that's offering a,
an API,

527
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:43,080
a paid API that can turn
sketches into actual html.

528
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:47,430
And then it'll go pay another vendor
to actually package that into a docker

529
00:28:47,431 --> 00:28:50,310
container and upload it
somewhere. And then, um,

530
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:54,480
another vendor to host the actual live
website and then another vendor to buy a

531
00:28:54,481 --> 00:28:56,730
domain.
And finally we'll tip the developer.

532
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,440
So I'll go show you what that looks like.

533
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,500
So the first thing you need to
do is I need to pick my sketch.

534
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:05,200
So I'm just going to grab one here.
And so this is the sketch of my website.

535
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,450
There's probably a
little bit small to see,

536
00:29:06,451 --> 00:29:10,050
but it has like some tax and it has a
little chart and it has some more texts.

537
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,540
And just to be clear, again,
like the AI is mach. Dot.

538
00:29:12,541 --> 00:29:16,590
We didn't actually create the AI just for
the demo. That would be ridiculous. Um,

539
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:19,260
but uh, yeah, in the future,
this could very well be possible.

540
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:22,500
So now I'm going to say make my site
and now things are gonna happen very

541
00:29:22,501 --> 00:29:26,370
quickly. So it's going to upload
that sketch to that Ai, sorry. Done.

542
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:31,610
And now it's uploaded the finished html
to get back to a service that turns into

543
00:29:31,711 --> 00:29:34,290
the docker container.
And as you can see on the right,

544
00:29:34,291 --> 00:29:37,920
and I might do the demo twice as, so
you can see it again, I'm on the right,

545
00:29:37,921 --> 00:29:39,630
you saw the total amount paid.

546
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:43,080
This is in a XOP drops us would
be 1000000th of an extra p.

547
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:47,470
So a total paid would be 0.1 XRP um,
which is about,

548
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:51,760
what does that like 2 cents,
3 cents, sorry, two, $3.

549
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:56,610
Nobody sends point. What a,
sorry, 2010, that's like, yeah,

550
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,720
it's like 30 cents or
something, whatever. Um,

551
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:02,800
so you could see like the individual
packets and there's a couple of things

552
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:06,070
going on. Um, and I think
I will run through the demo
again just so you can see.

553
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,310
So first when we paid that Ai,
um,

554
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:13,270
we paid a sort of one lump sum amount
and then the packager is actually a

555
00:30:13,271 --> 00:30:15,310
streaming, uh, paid end points.

556
00:30:15,311 --> 00:30:19,390
So that's a paid end point where as we
sended data and we ask it to do things,

557
00:30:19,391 --> 00:30:23,530
we'll stream packets to it to keep it
paid. And if we ever don't keep up,

558
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:26,600
it'll like stop working
until we pay it more. Um,

559
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:31,210
and then we deployed it to a host and
bought a domain and then sent a tip to the

560
00:30:31,211 --> 00:30:31,940
developer.

561
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:35,440
And I can actually click this button
here and I look over here and as you can

562
00:30:35,441 --> 00:30:37,540
see, our website is now up
and I can actually show you,

563
00:30:37,541 --> 00:30:41,920
it's like all of this running locally,
but uh, we got a domain, et cetera. Right?

564
00:30:41,921 --> 00:30:46,600
It's like set it up. Um, so let's go
through a demo one more time just to,

565
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:49,900
so you can see kind of the, the streaming
payments part a little bit better.

566
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:55,300
So I'll pick the web, the same
website. So you're on a ride.

567
00:30:55,301 --> 00:30:58,990
You can see like total paid right now
is 500 drops. It's to pay for the AI.

568
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,360
Now we're streaming to
pay for the packager.

569
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:06,361
So does this going in 258 drop intervals
and then we have a large expense to

570
00:31:06,821 --> 00:31:09,640
host the website. Um, 9,000 drops.

571
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:14,500
That's over 9,002 to
actually buy the domain.

572
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,930
And then finally we tipped the
developer a thousand drops.

573
00:31:16,931 --> 00:31:18,580
And so if I make an APP like that,

574
00:31:18,581 --> 00:31:20,910
I have a built in business model
and I think that's really the,

575
00:31:20,911 --> 00:31:25,120
the key point to get across here is I
think this will have a huge impact on the

576
00:31:25,121 --> 00:31:28,420
web where think about if I
start a convenience store,

577
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,160
I don't need to think about
what my business model is.

578
00:31:30,161 --> 00:31:32,800
My business model is people pay
me when they come buy things.

579
00:31:32,801 --> 00:31:35,740
When I open a restaurant I don't think
about by business mom business model is

580
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,110
people pay for the food that
they eat on the Internet.

581
00:31:38,111 --> 00:31:41,500
We have this weird thing where like there
isn't a good way to charge people for

582
00:31:41,501 --> 00:31:44,080
using your website.
And so we build advertising,

583
00:31:44,081 --> 00:31:48,430
we build subscriptions and all kinds of
hacky work arounds for like how to get

584
00:31:48,431 --> 00:31:50,680
money out of people just
from visiting your website.

585
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:54,040
And I think this will present a
pretty efficient alternative, um,

586
00:31:54,041 --> 00:31:57,700
in the future where people can just pay
you for, for the, for using your site.

587
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:02,590
So that's it. And again,
back to this. Thank you.

588
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:03,860
Thank you.
Stir fry.

589
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,960
[inaudible]

590
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:12,290
now we'd like to open it up
to questions from you guys.

591
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:17,480
Does anybody have any questions? Thanks
for the presentation again. Um, yeah,

592
00:32:17,481 --> 00:32:21,710
so there's like a lot of different
coins that deal with payments,

593
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:26,090
like a repo light coin, stellar
for example, that I've heard of.

594
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,630
Uh, can you go like a little
bit over what's the different,

595
00:32:29,631 --> 00:32:32,840
like the basic differences between all
those different payment platforms and

596
00:32:32,841 --> 00:32:37,841
then also do you see like one payment
platform just dominating and we all just

597
00:32:38,301 --> 00:32:41,450
use one of them?
Or can these somehow like live in harmony,

598
00:32:41,451 --> 00:32:43,280
kind of like USD and euros and whatnot?

599
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,940
Yeah, maybe I'll do good.
So on the second part, um,

600
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:49,740
I think it's going to shape out a lot.

601
00:32:49,741 --> 00:32:52,770
Like what you're seeing with a
few currencies. I mean, you know,

602
00:32:52,771 --> 00:32:57,480
the world kind of has four majors, maybe
five majors, and then there's kind of a,

603
00:32:57,481 --> 00:33:00,540
you know, um, everything else. Um,

604
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:04,380
and I think that probably plays
out here simply because, um,

605
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,410
particularly with this sort of
Wall Street wave that's coming,

606
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:12,310
a lot of those institutions, they're not
buying how many, 2000 different, you know,

607
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:14,610
kind of coins and imply
platforms out there.

608
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,600
There's sort of grab and I don't know,

609
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:21,420
top 10 or five or it's some
smaller number and you know,

610
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:26,130
in currencies, liquidity begets
liquidity. All of this is about, uh,

611
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,680
how much liquidity, uh,
is kind of, you know,

612
00:33:28,681 --> 00:33:32,520
kind of supporting these
platforms and these and these, uh,

613
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:34,740
these currencies or commodities,
wherever you want to call them.

614
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:37,500
There's still a lot of debate
on what they actually are.

615
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:40,370
So I suspect that's going to accelerate.
And you and,

616
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:44,750
and that liquidity then it attracts more
use cases. Like for example, ripple.

617
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:47,940
The company focuses on the
enterprise use case. But you know,

618
00:33:47,941 --> 00:33:52,890
we see these things we see Xrp is, is
very much a general global digital asset.

619
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:55,890
Without a counterparty. So, uh, you know,

620
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:00,780
you'll see more and more use cases
popping up from different angles and that

621
00:34:00,781 --> 00:34:02,520
just kind of drives more liquidity.

622
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:06,250
So I think that's probably the way
it might be, how it pans out. But

623
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:10,740
yeah, I think the reason we developed
into ledger and the reason we built an

624
00:34:10,741 --> 00:34:13,950
interoperability protocol was
because of that exact realization.

625
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:16,890
It wasn't going to be
everyone using one system.

626
00:34:16,891 --> 00:34:18,570
There was going to be a
number of different systems.

627
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:22,530
And actually behind that as another
realization, which is, you know,

628
00:34:22,531 --> 00:34:26,400
my goal has always been, you know,
to solve the problem of, you know,

629
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:29,760
friction and payments. Right? And so, um,

630
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:33,780
I realized that the centralization wasn't
necessarily the solution because you

631
00:34:33,781 --> 00:34:35,370
see a paypal,
they come out,

632
00:34:35,371 --> 00:34:38,080
they have free then eventually to
check up their fees when they have an

633
00:34:38,081 --> 00:34:41,190
established market position. But then
you see bitcoin doing the same thing,

634
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:45,540
not necessarily with us as much slit of
agency, but it still happens that way.

635
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:49,650
And so what you got to think
about is right now when
you're on a payment network,

636
00:34:49,651 --> 00:34:53,430
you can only send money to the
people on the same network. Um,

637
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:57,990
and that's kind of like pre Internet
online services where you could have like

638
00:34:57,991 --> 00:35:01,410
compuserve and you can email anyone
on compuserve and you can, you know,

639
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,150
use any services that are uncomfy served,

640
00:35:03,151 --> 00:35:06,440
but you can't access any services
that are on genie. Right?

641
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:11,190
And so compuserve has this like moat, they
have a defensibility around the reach.

642
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:15,000
And so that's really what you got to
commoditize what you got to attack.

643
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,380
And so with payments,

644
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:19,530
it's still that way today where like
if you're on the same payment network,

645
00:35:19,531 --> 00:35:22,980
you can pay each other. If you're on
different networks, you can't. Um,

646
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:25,950
if you want to pay from your paypal
account to a mobile money account in

647
00:35:25,951 --> 00:35:28,050
Tanzania, you're screwed. You can't, um,

648
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:32,670
yet I can totally go on my mobile phone
in Tanzania and open any website in the

649
00:35:32,671 --> 00:35:34,890
world, right? So we need that
kind of interoperability.

650
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,160
And that's really what creates a
competition that drives the cost. Um,

651
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:42,300
the reason we think that Xrp is going to
have a role in this system is because,

652
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,600
um, we've been doing, I mean, not to
toot our own horn too much, but like we,

653
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:49,770
we've been doing really well in
terms of like the performance and the

654
00:35:49,771 --> 00:35:51,210
characteristics of the protocol.

655
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:55,200
So I think a lot of people will choose
to use Xrp if there is sort of a lot of

656
00:35:55,201 --> 00:35:59,160
competition was like right now you use
bitcoin even though it's expensive,

657
00:35:59,161 --> 00:36:01,510
you use bitcoin even though it's slow.
Um,

658
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,530
I think if there's a lot of competition,
people will pick the most efficient,

659
00:36:04,531 --> 00:36:05,760
which would be extra p right now.

660
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,930
You know,
that as well.

661
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:11,860
It's kind of in an environment where a
lot of the volume I think is speculative.

662
00:36:11,861 --> 00:36:16,861
I actually think that kind of use case
has a greater tolerance for costs.

663
00:36:18,311 --> 00:36:20,720
Speed kind of doesn't
really care. Right. Um,

664
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:23,710
whereas as you started getting into kind
of these use cases where you need like,

665
00:36:23,711 --> 00:36:28,180
you know, millions of some kind of
unit, um, that matters a ton, right?

666
00:36:28,181 --> 00:36:33,181
So as the kind of the ratio of a real
use cases to speculative volume changes,

667
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:39,850
I think that dynamic becomes
more important. True. I'm
sorry. Next question. Cool.

668
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,400
Thanks.
Thank you.

669
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:45,300
Uh, Hey, uh, thanks so much for
coming. Uh, my question is around,

670
00:36:45,301 --> 00:36:50,220
so if you're talking about that Xrp
and cryptos are the Internet of money,

671
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:54,710
the big difference between money and
data is that money's regulated and banks

672
00:36:54,711 --> 00:36:55,680
certainly,
you know,

673
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:59,430
if they were the like the equivalent
of running the phone lines before,

674
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:02,100
I have a pretty big incentive to uh,

675
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,790
innovative and sort of get ahead
of a change that that is coming.

676
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:10,110
So you could see them easily upgrading
the swift protocol to be able to move

677
00:37:10,111 --> 00:37:11,730
money internationally a lot quicker.

678
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:16,910
And so I'm curious how you
guys see specifically XRP
living in a more regulated

679
00:37:17,731 --> 00:37:19,110
space. I think, you know,

680
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:22,050
the crypto sort of took the world by
storm and governments are going to

681
00:37:22,051 --> 00:37:23,820
certainly respond the next year or two.

682
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:28,950
So why do you think that Xrp is going
to be able to live in a much more

683
00:37:28,951 --> 00:37:32,700
regulated industry than data
is? Uh, especially because like,

684
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:36,000
you could see banks upgrading swift
to be able to support, you know,

685
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:40,890
maybe like submitted transactions instead
of, uh, transactions that take days.

686
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:46,050
I want to like quickly question
some of the premises in there. Um,

687
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:50,370
so I think a lot of the people in the
room I think are very young and so we grew

688
00:37:50,371 --> 00:37:52,620
up after the deregulation of data.

689
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:56,820
And so like the Internet came out and a
lot of the laws that were around before

690
00:37:56,821 --> 00:38:00,120
then, copyright law, you
know, cryptography laws, uh,

691
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:04,320
export restrictions around algorithms
and things of that nature, you know,

692
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:08,400
actually got removed and are safe harbors
got created because the internet kind

693
00:38:08,401 --> 00:38:11,040
of post the technology that was
on the one hand, very useful.

694
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:15,000
And on the other hand, kind of an
illegal gray area. So I think that um,

695
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,740
the technology,
this if you use it,

696
00:38:16,741 --> 00:38:20,490
it just feels so incredible useful that
it's hard to imagine how regulations

697
00:38:20,491 --> 00:38:22,800
wouldn't be built around it.
Um,

698
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:27,180
I think that there's
definitely an opportunity for
people to be thoughtful and

699
00:38:27,181 --> 00:38:31,380
intelligent about how to, how they
approach the technology in the meantime.

700
00:38:31,381 --> 00:38:34,210
Like you want to be
compliant, you want to do, uh,

701
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:37,990
everything that you can to kind of, you
know, stay within the letter of the law.

702
00:38:37,991 --> 00:38:42,430
But there are going to be a ambiguity
is in terms of like just the law is not

703
00:38:42,431 --> 00:38:46,270
written for these kinds of use cases.
So, um, I think that's one thing.

704
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,570
And then as far as like extra Pto,
I think I'll hand it off to Chris.

705
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:54,610
Yeah, I mean you're raising a, obviously
a key part in has, as I mentioned before,

706
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,120
the Internet of value is
kind of equal parts, uh,

707
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:00,760
capital technology and compliance
compliance is hugely important.

708
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:01,780
And the reason is simple.

709
00:39:01,781 --> 00:39:04,810
I think it's just because governments
sorta want to have a monopoly.

710
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,330
I think it's actually a more,
a question of, you know,

711
00:39:09,331 --> 00:39:14,080
data is powerful but money's
more powerful, right? Um,
you know, data can show you,

712
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:18,550
um, you know, a life saving medicine that
your family might need it, can't buy it.

713
00:39:18,551 --> 00:39:21,490
Money can buy it. On the
flip side, um, you know,

714
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,660
data can encourage a terrorist
to do something awful. Um,

715
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:27,930
money can buy the weapons, right?
So the stakes are higher. Um,

716
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:31,510
which I think actually this is going
to have maybe a more profound effect on

717
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:35,920
earth, good and bad. So regulators have
got to be there every step of the way.

718
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:40,270
This fantasy that somehow this is
going to bypass governments and bypass

719
00:39:40,271 --> 00:39:44,160
compliance. You know what, that's just,
that's just bs. And you know what?

720
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:46,450
Nobody wants that.
Nobody wants that.

721
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:51,190
That is a champagne problem with a bunch
of rich young people that can sit there

722
00:39:51,191 --> 00:39:54,310
behind their computer screens and like
block out a lot of bad things that can

723
00:39:54,311 --> 00:39:57,640
happen. So it just can't go that way. Um,

724
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:01,420
and so I think we're trying to think about
that. Try to be pragmatic about that.

725
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,130
Cause that's the only way
we're going to have impact.

726
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,430
And if you look at people that are
trying to support what's going on in the

727
00:40:06,431 --> 00:40:10,540
developing world, um, they
are very much wanting to work.

728
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,010
They're not trying to go around,

729
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,380
they're trying to work within the system
because they know that's how you're

730
00:40:14,381 --> 00:40:18,730
going to have impact. Um, so that's,
that's kind of the way we see it.

731
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,400
Your question about swift
by the way. Um, the,

732
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:25,810
the problem with that point of view
is swift only deals with the data.

733
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:29,590
They have a correspondent banking partner
that deals with the value and that's

734
00:40:29,591 --> 00:40:33,970
off any sense of an Internet of value.
The whole point here is that, uh,

735
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,690
something like interledger and Xrp
can eliminate the correspondent,

736
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:40,990
which is actually where all the juices,
right? That's where all the waste is.

737
00:40:40,991 --> 00:40:44,110
That's where the sediment risk is.
That's where the failures are.

738
00:40:44,111 --> 00:40:47,830
That's where the time is.
So swift actually doesn't have the,

739
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:53,390
the combination of capabilities to do
what you're saying. Right. Cool. Sorry.

740
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:54,310
So thank you for the question.

741
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:57,990
Uh,

742
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:02,880
that's a pretty cool demo and I just want
to learn a little bit of a behind the

743
00:41:02,881 --> 00:41:07,310
scene that, for example, the
Ai, how the full building an AI,

744
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:12,240
how the money goes to the
Ai Chat Bot. Okay. Um,

745
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:16,410
so we built a protocol that
kind of takes intellect,

746
00:41:16,411 --> 00:41:19,520
juror on the one side and
takes HDP on the other side.

747
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,800
And essentially you're making rest calls.

748
00:41:21,801 --> 00:41:25,790
So you're making API calls to these back
ends and the first time you make the

749
00:41:25,791 --> 00:41:29,240
call, they all respond with
four oh two payment required,

750
00:41:29,241 --> 00:41:33,920
which is a sort of an error code. An HTP
two was already, we were like, great.

751
00:41:33,921 --> 00:41:36,200
That works for our use case.
And um,

752
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,680
basically it sends you back a header to
tells you all the information that you

753
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:43,190
need to know to make intelligent
payments to that exact, um,

754
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:46,480
and point or like the Api server
that runs that end point. Um,

755
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:51,020
and so that server will be listening for
intellectual packets in addition to the

756
00:41:51,021 --> 00:41:55,880
http requests. Um, and so when
you start paying, um, yeah,

757
00:41:55,881 --> 00:42:00,881
it'll go back into that same receiver
and then the receiver will then a credit

758
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:02,570
year, what we call like a token. Um,

759
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:06,260
and then the next time you make a request
that has in the header your token.

760
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,590
And so the receiver will know that you've
actually funded that with some packets

761
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:12,940
and then you will, you can proceed
through the, through the program. Um,

762
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,470
the streaming version of
the demo to you saw a,

763
00:42:15,471 --> 00:42:18,350
that's a little bit more complicated.
That's probably goes bill beyond,

764
00:42:18,351 --> 00:42:22,490
but we can maybe catch up about it
later. Um, and then, uh, one, uh,

765
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:24,920
one thing that's also interesting
is that one of the services,

766
00:42:24,921 --> 00:42:29,810
which is the thing that builds a static
site into a docker container actually

767
00:42:29,811 --> 00:42:33,410
itself pays another Api, right? So
you have another API behind that.

768
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,770
And so one of the things that's really
cool is with these streaming payments,

769
00:42:36,771 --> 00:42:40,120
we can actually have sort of
an API that takes in money, um,

770
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:43,960
in an immediately spends it assets trying
to process that request and then maybe

771
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:47,340
sends a little bit as profit to the
developer and then returns the results.

772
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:49,490
So this is a lot of cool
stuff you can do with it.

773
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:51,480
Great.
Thanks.

774
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:56,160
Thank you guys for coming to speak today.

775
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:59,730
I'm kind of curious to learn
more about how you might, uh,

776
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:05,010
prevent money laundering and, uh,
companies that participate in,

777
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:09,750
uh, you know, um, uh, you know,
like the payday loan type,

778
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:14,460
uh, companies from coming on the
system that exploit people financially.

779
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:19,040
Um, I'm interested to learn more
about that, that sort of thing. Yeah.

780
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:24,640
So, I mean, I think we, um, we
really try to focus on, you know,

781
00:43:24,641 --> 00:43:26,030
kind of the bottom of the payment stack.

782
00:43:26,031 --> 00:43:29,310
So kind of on the
infrastructure part of it. Um,

783
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:34,060
and are we going a reason for that is
that a lot of the things that prevent bad

784
00:43:34,061 --> 00:43:38,140
things from happening or kind of top
of the stack and a lot of that actually

785
00:43:38,141 --> 00:43:40,590
doesn't need to be
reinvented. Right? And, uh,

786
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,840
the way we kind of think of it as like,
let's focus on what's really changing.

787
00:43:43,841 --> 00:43:45,550
And we think this is the interoperability.

788
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:49,290
It's the idea of a digital asset with
no counterparty that can be spending

789
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:53,110
anywhere in the world that's neutral.
So those are the things I think we can,

790
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:55,150
we can, uh, can change.

791
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:59,620
And then piggy back off of this is what
we like kind of the enterprise focus now

792
00:43:59,621 --> 00:44:02,890
is for that as that first
beachhead, um, you know,

793
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:06,380
piggyback off of what already exists for
hundreds of millions, uh, you know, uh,

794
00:44:06,381 --> 00:44:07,630
people.
Um,

795
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:11,920
the other thing I would say is that if
this Internet of value becomes a reality,

796
00:44:11,921 --> 00:44:14,740
I think, you know, the prevention
of things like payday lending,

797
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:19,900
obviously it has to be regulated.
That's a big part of that at every level.

798
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:23,470
But the other big thing to what
Stefan mentioned before is sort of the

799
00:44:23,471 --> 00:44:27,040
commoditization of reach.
Um, if you have that,

800
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:30,700
you suddenly now every market
has way more competitors, uh,

801
00:44:30,701 --> 00:44:31,560
for financial products.

802
00:44:31,561 --> 00:44:34,320
And it was something we saw at prosper
and Isla and we got frustrated with

803
00:44:34,321 --> 00:44:36,840
because we were kind of us in one lane.
You couldn't,

804
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:40,680
you couldn't transport it
to another market because
you were in another network.

805
00:44:40,681 --> 00:44:40,920
Right.

806
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:45,920
That this future vision I think is
that the world is one big financial

807
00:44:46,621 --> 00:44:50,160
supermarket and you know,
everybody's competing in every market.

808
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:54,570
I think that goes a long way, but you
still need all the other, you know,

809
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:59,190
kind of regulatory components. Uh,
pretty much existing at some may go away,

810
00:44:59,191 --> 00:45:01,050
but I'd say probably most of them don't.

811
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:02,420
I don't know what you want to add to that,
but

812
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:06,200
yeah, I think like with, with
uh, you know, you mentioned
the anti money laundering,

813
00:45:06,201 --> 00:45:09,020
I think there's sort of a long list
of things that are actually completely

814
00:45:09,021 --> 00:45:13,070
separate issues, right? There's
sort of consumer risk. There is, um,

815
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:18,020
any money laundering there is, um,
uh, yeah antiterrorism finance,

816
00:45:18,021 --> 00:45:19,310
like there's all kinds
of different things.

817
00:45:19,311 --> 00:45:21,920
So you have to think about when
you're building a, a payment system.

818
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,980
And so if you have a stack like this,

819
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:27,410
they'll fit in different parts
of the stack. Like for instance,

820
00:45:27,411 --> 00:45:30,350
consumer protection that would
fit in the application layer.

821
00:45:30,351 --> 00:45:33,710
So if you're building an application
where consumers are sending money,

822
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:34,970
you have to think about,
you know,

823
00:45:34,971 --> 00:45:38,810
how to protect those consumers
from sending it to the
wrong people. If you have,

824
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:41,030
if you're thinking about
risk or counterparty risk,

825
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:45,330
that would fit in the sort of the ledger
layer, right? So you have a counterparty,

826
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:47,120
they settle with you
on a certain schedule.

827
00:45:47,121 --> 00:45:49,620
How do you make sure they
actually settle with you? Um,

828
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:53,280
so there are a myriad of
things to think about. Um,

829
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:57,050
I think that it's kind of a losery for
us to come up with all the solutions.

830
00:45:57,051 --> 00:46:00,620
I think we're trying to be thoughtful
in terms of like getting it to a point

831
00:46:00,621 --> 00:46:02,400
where we can start
experimenting with it and,

832
00:46:02,401 --> 00:46:04,180
and kind of get more experienced with it.
Um,

833
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:08,120
but that's gonna require
sort of a commercialization
of the technology to really

834
00:46:08,121 --> 00:46:12,350
think about, you know, all
of those use cases. Um, and
I would also highlight that,

835
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,930
um, you know, ripple has a
commercial, um, uh, you know,

836
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:21,390
stack and commercial feature set, and that
is very much like Chris said, you know,

837
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,110
writing within the existing
regulatory framework.

838
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:26,120
And then we have the open protocols,

839
00:46:26,121 --> 00:46:27,950
which are maybe a little
bit more forward looking.

840
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:30,380
And I think some of those
questions are more difficult there.

841
00:46:30,381 --> 00:46:33,800
So what you saw us present today
is the more forward looking stuff.

842
00:46:33,801 --> 00:46:35,630
So I think some of those
questions are still open there.

843
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:40,750
Great. Thank you very much. Thank you. Hi.

844
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,570
Thanks for the presentation.
Um,

845
00:46:44,290 --> 00:46:48,580
so since the tech is currency agnostic,

846
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:50,620
um,
why,

847
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:56,010
what would be the incentive to choose XRP
over fear or any other cryptocurrency?

848
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:57,793
Hmm.

849
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:58,130
Um,

850
00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:02,440
so this is where it almost love to like
ask my colleague up on stage cause um,

851
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:02,841
you know,

852
00:47:02,841 --> 00:47:06,020
we have our team who was actually
trying to integrate with these different

853
00:47:06,021 --> 00:47:07,610
digital assets and you know,

854
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:12,130
different payment systems
and it's just a like a,

855
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:17,120
like an many orders of magnitude of
difference between extra and let's say

856
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:18,160
bitcoin.
Um,

857
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:21,740
and still several orders of magnitude
between extra p in something like light

858
00:47:21,741 --> 00:47:25,670
coin, which is known as a more
efficient, so acid and like, um,

859
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:29,140
it's just a pleasure to work with.
And part of it is it,

860
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,940
it's been designed for that,
right?

861
00:47:30,941 --> 00:47:34,960
Like it's been designed to be used as the
settlement acid in, into ledger and so,

862
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:39,210
uh, has a lot of functionality
like payment channels
built in a certain way, um,

863
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:44,080
that are incredibly efficient for
this particular use case. And so,

864
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,910
um,
I think the big answer,

865
00:47:45,911 --> 00:47:48,910
the main answer is right now
it's just the best thing to use.

866
00:47:48,911 --> 00:47:51,760
Like we talked to people, Hey,
let's, uh, set up a connector. Well,

867
00:47:51,761 --> 00:47:52,541
what do we peer with?

868
00:47:52,541 --> 00:47:56,040
While we could use light coin but what
we could use extra p but x people just to

869
00:47:56,041 --> 00:48:00,410
be cheaper. So let's use XRP.
Um, and so I think as much, uh,

870
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,890
to the extent that like these connectors
are going to be competing with each

871
00:48:02,891 --> 00:48:05,950
other and they're trying to
think about their margins,

872
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:08,720
experiential is going to look like
a very good option for them. Yeah.

873
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:09,460
In this world

874
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:13,780
you'll just, you'll need some
digital asset that is super fast,

875
00:48:13,781 --> 00:48:18,760
super cheap, endlessly scalable, um, that
will serve the world very well, right.

876
00:48:18,761 --> 00:48:22,780
Better than let's say using a
dollar or using a euro, right.

877
00:48:22,781 --> 00:48:24,790
Something that is a
neutral to any network.

878
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:28,670
So we're absolutely confident
that some digital asset, uh,

879
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:31,660
will be a key part of
this Internet of value.

880
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:34,150
But we think that sort of fast co,
you know,

881
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:38,290
cost and scalability are going to be those
key things and that's what's going to

882
00:48:38,291 --> 00:48:40,420
drive the liquidity that's going
to make these things really useful.

883
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:43,010
Yeah.
Like extra p is not static either.

884
00:48:43,011 --> 00:48:46,480
It's like we're constantly thinking
about how to help improve it. Um,

885
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:49,680
there's a community out there. It's
thinking about how to improve it. So, um,

886
00:48:49,790 --> 00:48:53,480
you can expect that it will get better as
well as, as, um, you know, time goes on.

887
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:59,620
Final question. Hi. So I was still, uh,

888
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:04,930
in the very beginning of your presentation
about how you think except piece

889
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:07,850
better over bitcoin in a sense
that bitcoin is a lot slower,

890
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,300
a lot more expensive, but um,
but is there for a reason, right?

891
00:49:11,301 --> 00:49:15,920
Cause it requires like at least six
confirmation across the network in Warren

892
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,170
Person's action to happen and,

893
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:20,210
and that is their invoice would
address the double spending problem.

894
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:22,490
So I was just curious,
like in your own words,

895
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:25,730
how does that Xrp addressed it that
will spend problem if it's just a

896
00:49:25,731 --> 00:49:28,260
confirmation between the
two notes. Yeah. Yeah. Um,

897
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:32,280
so if you're not technical please, you
know, do something else for a little bit.

898
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:36,950
Um, cause there's no way to answer that
question without getting into some of the

899
00:49:36,951 --> 00:49:40,380
technologies. So, um, bitcoin
users or consensus process,

900
00:49:40,381 --> 00:49:44,220
which is essentially based around the
assumption that a majority of hashing

901
00:49:44,221 --> 00:49:48,720
power will never be held by a, you know,
a coordinated, malicious attacker. Um,

902
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:52,560
and so if you're watching what the
majority of hashing power is doing,

903
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:57,150
you'll tend to be on a state of the
network that is reasonable and it doesn't

904
00:49:57,151 --> 00:50:00,200
contain, you know, reverse the
transactions and so on. Um,

905
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:04,530
however the protocol as such does
allow rollbacks, right? So you can,

906
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:07,050
if somebody else presents you
with a chain that's longer,

907
00:50:07,051 --> 00:50:08,550
it has more hashing power behind it,

908
00:50:08,551 --> 00:50:10,770
you will roll back your
transactions and switched to that.

909
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:14,820
And I know that because I was one of the
first person people to implement a full

910
00:50:14,821 --> 00:50:17,820
node bitcoin re implementation
from scratch. Um,

911
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,910
so I wrote that code and it's very
complex and knowing code to write.

912
00:50:20,911 --> 00:50:25,440
So I will remember that forever. Um, on
the ripple side, such code does not exist.

913
00:50:25,441 --> 00:50:28,820
There's no way to roll back network.
Now how is that possible? Well,

914
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:32,210
the way that ripple works is,
um, as I mentioned before,

915
00:50:32,211 --> 00:50:34,560
the user select these validators.
Um,

916
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:37,710
and then we essentially
use that input as a, um,

917
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:41,960
as an input to sort of an algorithm
where we look at the graph of what people

918
00:50:41,961 --> 00:50:46,961
selected and then we run a consensus
on validators that are central to that

919
00:50:47,241 --> 00:50:50,510
graph or like that are highly
trusted within that graph.

920
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,550
And so it's sort of this two step process.

921
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:55,910
And what that means is that when the
first step is complete and you'd try,

922
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:59,000
you've identified which
validators you're looking for, um,

923
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:03,740
you don't have to worry about there being
like more hashing power just over the

924
00:51:03,741 --> 00:51:04,310
horizon.

925
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:07,880
Like once you hear from the validators
that you've identified it as being the

926
00:51:07,881 --> 00:51:12,290
ones that are validating or like the
ones that you, you're listening to, um,

927
00:51:12,291 --> 00:51:15,380
then you don't have to worry about
some other validate are coming in later

928
00:51:15,381 --> 00:51:18,170
saying like, no, actually we decided
this. You just didn't hear about it yet.

929
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:22,990
And so there's no need to roll back or
to, um, to rewrite history. One smell.

930
00:51:22,991 --> 00:51:26,120
It does have committed to a decision.
They can't change their minds essentially.

931
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:29,570
Um, and so that has a couple of, um,

932
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:32,570
impacts where like a couple of ways that
the protocol is different because of

933
00:51:32,571 --> 00:51:35,270
that. Number one, you only have
to wait for one confirmation.

934
00:51:35,271 --> 00:51:38,870
You wouldn't wait for
multiple confirmations because
values can change their

935
00:51:38,871 --> 00:51:42,740
mind. You can't roll back. So there's
no probabilistic aspect to it. Um,

936
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,610
number two is, uh, we can, um,

937
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:49,760
process or we can create blocks on the
cadence so we can create blocks and like

938
00:51:49,761 --> 00:51:54,530
a, a fixed interval as opposed to a random
interval like bitcoin where, you know,

939
00:51:54,531 --> 00:51:56,690
blocks can come out very close together.
They could,

940
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:59,960
there could be no block for a long time
because we know which validators they're

941
00:51:59,961 --> 00:52:04,280
supposed to generate blocks
they can generate them on
that cadence. Um, and then,

942
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:05,750
uh,
finally

943
00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:07,960
I think that'll cover everything.
Yeah,

944
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:12,350
yeah. Whatever it is, there's
a really good talk on, um,

945
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:15,070
why shouldn't call it real good,
but there's a talk by myself

946
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:16,210
on consensus.

947
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:18,200
Um,

948
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:21,250
but you can find out from the consensus
thousand 17 conference where I go into a

949
00:52:21,251 --> 00:52:24,060
little bit more detail and I'm also
happy to talk to you afterwards,

950
00:52:24,061 --> 00:52:26,550
but that's kind of the high
level quick description.

951
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:30,650
Cool
guys,

952
00:52:30,651 --> 00:52:32,080
thank you so much for coming.
Uh,

953
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:35,240
do you have any final statements or do
you want to tell people how they can get

954
00:52:35,241 --> 00:52:37,040
involved in the rebel community at all?

955
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:41,270
Yeah, so for interledger
there's intellectual.org, um,

956
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:43,480
which at the time of recording
this horribly out of date,

957
00:52:43,481 --> 00:52:46,930
but hopefully by next week
should be showing you all
the latest, greatest stuff.

958
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:50,230
Um, there's a community group at
the w three c called Di intellect,

959
00:52:50,231 --> 00:52:53,530
your community group that's open
to anyone to just register. Uh,

960
00:52:53,531 --> 00:52:56,020
we have a mailing list where we discuss,
you know,

961
00:52:56,021 --> 00:53:00,550
how these protocols work together. Um,
all the code for the demos and everything.

962
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:05,350
Um, you can find that on github.com/intel
Ledger and slash into ledger js.

963
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:10,420
Um, and then for ripple ripple.com if
you're a bank, you know, let us know.

964
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:14,050
Reach out if your payment provider and
we've maybe if worked for Google payments

965
00:53:14,051 --> 00:53:17,950
or anything like that, let
us know. And then, um, for,

966
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:21,640
there's another project which we didn't
really mention today. Um, but that's also,

967
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:24,550
uh, was also using the demo in the
background, which is called Codea.

968
00:53:24,551 --> 00:53:28,380
So that's basically the hosting a
system that's paid within to ledger,

969
00:53:28,381 --> 00:53:30,810
and we uploaded the website to it.
Um,

970
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:33,270
there's a lot of cool use cases around
hosting if you're thinking about

971
00:53:33,271 --> 00:53:36,660
serverless hosting, et cetera. So if you
enter that, there's codis.org as well.

972
00:53:36,661 --> 00:53:41,250
C O d I s.org. Awesome. Chris,
Stefan, thank you so much for coming.

973
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:42,084
Really appreciate it.

974
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:46,610
[inaudible].
