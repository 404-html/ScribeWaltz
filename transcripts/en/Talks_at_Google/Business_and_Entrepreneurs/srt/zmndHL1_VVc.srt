1
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:11,540
Hello everyone. Thank you for
having me here. So before I start,

2
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,130
just curious, how many of you are working
on AI stuff? Okay, raise your hand.

3
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,323
Oh,
a lot.

4
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:26,470
So today my topic is AI startup
ecosystem in the US and China.

5
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:33,010
I will provide some comparative
perspectives on the two ecosystems.

6
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:39,710
Okay. So many of you have noticed
that AI startups grow rapidly.

7
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:41,500
Okay.

8
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,530
So if you look at Ai Unicorns,
Unicorns,

9
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:49,550
meaning startups have over 1
billion valuations, there are 20,

10
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,500
32 Ai Unicorns in by 2018.

11
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,650
So this is a report here by CB insights.

12
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:02,910
This is about 10% of the whole Unicorn
club and that this percentage is

13
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,400
continued growing.

14
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,450
Now that there's 17 companies from us,
10 from China.

15
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,440
So it looks like us has
more AI unit concern China.

16
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:19,420
But if we look at this figure,
um,

17
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,840
we look at top five
most funded Ai Unicorns.

18
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:28,290
Actually China has rate and the most
too well founded Ai Unicorns are from

19
00:01:30,581 --> 00:01:35,500
China. Maybe you are not familiar
with some of the companies.

20
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,900
I will provide you a little
bit quick background.

21
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:39,590
Okay.

22
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:44,150
The first well funded company
is caught by dams. Actually.

23
00:01:44,151 --> 00:01:49,151
They have a big office in Culver
city by dance raised three billing.

24
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:54,890
It's a Chinese company. It has a number
of products, but the two main products,

25
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,850
one is total,
which is AI powered new zap.

26
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,710
It has over 500 million
monthly active users.

27
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,160
The second one, which is probably
more popular called Tick Tock,

28
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:13,820
they have over 500 million
monthly active users globally.

29
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,170
This is a AI powered,
a short video sharing app.

30
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:22,100
If you haven't use it,
please have a try.

31
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,200
Okay.

32
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,580
Now the second well funded Ai
Company is called a sense time.

33
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,190
The company raised 2.6 billion
in folks on computer vision.

34
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:39,910
Now since time has over 700 enterprise
customers and the strategic partners

35
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:42,643
globally,

36
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,900
it has applications over
more than 10 industries.

37
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:53,630
The main technology or product and
have since time is facial recognition.

38
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,730
There's facial recognition. Service
is serving over 400 million people.

39
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,033
Yeah,

40
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,020
so the fifth well found,
the company is called a ubi tech.

41
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,490
It's another Chinese company.

42
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,840
This company is building
their service robotics, right?

43
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:14,400
This looks human like robotics
are produced by UV tech.

44
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,360
There's a lot of robotics,

45
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,190
so the revenue in 2018 is
actually over 300 million.

46
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:26,580
So the Saudis robots very well and their
sales increased over 500 times within

47
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,463
four years.

48
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,160
Okay.

49
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:38,160
If we look at the two other companies
from the U s they are auto autonomous

50
00:03:38,571 --> 00:03:41,840
driving companies,
neuro and Argo Ai,

51
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:46,220
they both raised a billing
euro is a little bit different.

52
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,960
They are building this self
driving car for food delivery.

53
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,200
Well it can also deliver
other stuff later on.

54
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,670
Argo AI is more like standard
self driving car company.

55
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,200
They build in self driving cars.

56
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,670
We notice that these five top,
most well funded AI companies,

57
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:13,010
they are all funded within a few years
and there are so many other unicorns they

58
00:04:13,761 --> 00:04:15,020
grow so rapidly.

59
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:20,380
So the question I want to ask is why are
these AI startups growing so rapidly?

60
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,850
There are a couple of reasons.
First,

61
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,450
there's continuous progress
in data processing,

62
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:34,340
computing power and the algorithms.
If we look at this two fingers,

63
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,760
this is some statistics
on image net dataset.

64
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,500
I think many of you should know that.
Um,

65
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:46,190
if we look at as the classification
accuracy, image net Dataset,

66
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:51,330
the accuracy continuous to
improve, right? In 2014, um,

67
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:56,500
and actually after 2014 it beats humans
and now it continuous to improve.

68
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:03,370
Another very interesting observation
is that in the past a year or two,

69
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:07,820
the training time and the image net to
building this machine learning models

70
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,910
actually jobs dramatically right,

71
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:15,050
sounds to all these parallel
computing cloud computing.

72
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:21,890
Now the second reason for the rapid
growth of AI companies is a significant

73
00:05:21,891 --> 00:05:23,510
growth of venture capital into Ai.

74
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,500
So this figure shows the global
AI investments year by year.

75
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:34,610
We can see that the trend is that VC
money is growing year by year into Ai.

76
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,070
And in 2008,

77
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:43,120
the VC money total actually
is 70% up compared to 2017.

78
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:50,690
Now this curve actually
shows the number of deals.

79
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,470
So interestingly,
in 2018,

80
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:59,770
the number of deals that raised money
is actually a fewer than that in 2017

81
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,590
and we are observed a large
loans but fewer teachers,

82
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,870
fewer deals, meaning fewer
companies. Actually raised money.

83
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,090
So why is that?

84
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:21,570
Why given that so much money is into
AI but money are concentrated on deals,

85
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,980
larger, um, is fewer deals.

86
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:32,440
There are a couple of reasons but the
main point is that in some AI fields,

87
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,130
the bigger guest speaker,
basically big companies,

88
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,310
big startups are easier to
attract them more money.

89
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,770
So there are a couple of reasons.

90
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:47,220
So one is the data network effect because
these Ai Unicorns tended to collect

91
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:52,620
more and more data and these data actually
provide a company more advances in

92
00:06:52,931 --> 00:06:55,330
technology.
Secondary,

93
00:06:55,331 --> 00:07:00,331
these Ai Unicorns are easier to
attract a more AI talents and you know,

94
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:02,890
more I'd talents means right,

95
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,040
you have more power in terms
of technology development.

96
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:11,740
Suddenly these Ai Unicorns are
easier to expand to more territories.

97
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:16,390
Tick talk, as I said, the
core product of by dense,

98
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:20,560
they are actually expanded to the US,
Asia and Europe.

99
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,760
Now they have over 500 million
monthly active users globally.

100
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:32,040
The first reason is that these bigger AI
startups can expand to more industries

101
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,260
easier.
Since time as an example,

102
00:07:35,261 --> 00:07:38,260
they already covers over 10 industries.

103
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:45,910
No. A natural question to ask is,
well, there'll be more capital into AI,

104
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:50,710
probably. Yes. If you
look at the US VC market,

105
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,640
2018 is actually a record breaking year.

106
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:00,540
So this shows the total venture capital
money raised by US startups in 2018.

107
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:04,300
Right?

108
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:09,280
The amount is significantly larger
than 2017 and the years before.

109
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:10,910
Okay.

110
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:15,910
So it looks like this is great timing
for us AI startups because there's a lot

111
00:08:15,981 --> 00:08:17,810
of money in the market.

112
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:24,570
What about China in
southern 17 2017 actually,

113
00:08:24,911 --> 00:08:29,170
the, the AI funding, the VC
money in China exceeds the u s

114
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:31,321
right.

115
00:08:31,321 --> 00:08:36,321
The total fund in China is about 48%
of the total AI funding globally.

116
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:41,880
Well, you as has only 78, sorry, 38

117
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,980
but things are getting changing.
Uh, so if you look at this figure,

118
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:49,850
right,

119
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:54,850
starting from 2018 so the number of deals
and also the amount of venture capital

120
00:08:56,341 --> 00:08:59,610
money in China is decreasing.
So in China,

121
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,480
startups and the VC's are
facing so called Capitol winter.

122
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,340
Why is that? Uh, there's multiple reasons.

123
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,580
One reason is the
slowing economy of China.

124
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,880
And secondary also because of the
flooring share price of the tech giants,

125
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,090
people are afraid of the market. Uh,
there could be some other reasons,

126
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,310
but the main point is that in China,
the VC market, it's different.

127
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:31,320
It's getting changing. And this may
challenge the Chinese are Unicorns.

128
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:39,170
This other reason for the raptor growth
of Ai Unicorns is the thriving industry

129
00:09:39,171 --> 00:09:42,300
applications nowadays you can see AI,

130
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,030
unicorns are solving big problems in
almost each industry. You can imagine,

131
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:50,000
uh,
I will go to these details later,

132
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:56,020
but these massive application drives
the rapid growth of Ai Unicorns.

133
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,053
No.

134
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,180
Let's ask a second important question.

135
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:09,540
Why do some AI companies grow so rapidly
in one country but not in the other?

136
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:14,080
We notice like companies like
by dance like sense time,

137
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:19,530
they are big in China but not in the
u s right in the u s this autonomous

138
00:10:20,141 --> 00:10:24,610
driving startups raised a lot
of money but now seem in China.

139
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,380
So why is that?

140
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:34,490
So to answer this question,
actually we have four key observations.

141
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:38,990
So first for I and D
USA is a head of China

142
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,690
second that it for manufacturing.
China has its own advantages.

143
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:51,140
So delay for B,
two B industries us is stronger.

144
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:55,850
So what is B two B B Two B
stands for business to business.

145
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,400
Meaning the customers are enterprises.

146
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,200
Well for B two C and B
Two g China is stronger.

147
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:08,650
B Two c stands for business to
consumer or the customers or consumers.

148
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,290
B Two g g stands for government.

149
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:17,590
Many you are serving government hell for
B two C and B Two g China is stronger.

150
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:24,130
The force of the observation is that
Chinese unicorns actually I adopting some

151
00:11:25,581 --> 00:11:27,440
unique growth strategies.

152
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:31,160
So I will come to this
observations one by one.

153
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:37,520
First R and D USA is a
huddle ahead of China. Now,

154
00:11:37,521 --> 00:11:40,820
if we look at Ai Talents,
right?

155
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,710
So if we look at that,

156
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,640
the talents in or AI companies,

157
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:51,080
u s as about 1.5 x of the talent,

158
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:56,110
the number of talents in China, uh, the
difference is not significant, right?

159
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:59,320
But if we look at the
number of top AI talent,

160
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:04,710
u s has much more advantage that the
top AI talent in the u s is 5.3 times of

161
00:12:08,081 --> 00:12:12,350
the number in China, right? All
these AI talents are very important.

162
00:12:12,351 --> 00:12:16,390
The for int for developing
this disruptive technologies.

163
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:23,410
Another example is two, looking at
the autonomous driving technology.

164
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,440
This is sort of integrated AI technology
because you are building a complex

165
00:12:28,661 --> 00:12:33,460
system. This is a figure is
very interesting. It's report,

166
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,610
it's published by DMV in 2018.

167
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:41,260
It shows a miles per this engagement.
What does it mean?

168
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:46,261
It means how many miles can have a self
driving car drive until a human gets

169
00:12:47,171 --> 00:12:50,860
involved. So we can see that. Uh,

170
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:55,810
the first one is Waymo develop a
by Google. Waymo is obvious today,

171
00:12:55,811 --> 00:13:00,220
the top one in terms of the test,
right? But this is in Tucson,

172
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:04,300
the 18. Uh, for now,
Google is absolute leader.

173
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,430
Uh,
in this chart you s has 16 companies.

174
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:10,540
China has four,

175
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:16,170
looks like us self driving cost companies
are much more than China and other

176
00:13:16,331 --> 00:13:20,650
countries. Neuro Aurora,
I also doing well, right?

177
00:13:20,651 --> 00:13:24,940
You notice that the top five
companies are from the U s we need,

178
00:13:24,941 --> 00:13:26,920
they are ahead of China.
Uh,

179
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:30,550
interestingly in euro and Arora
I founded by x school goes.

180
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:35,140
So Waymo is a leader in
self driving car technology.

181
00:13:35,141 --> 00:13:40,141
It has built a large pool of talents way
more actually develop the technology 10

182
00:13:40,691 --> 00:13:43,330
years ago. Right? So, uh,

183
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:48,390
and the larger pool of talent developer
by Waymo actually helped other self

184
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,140
driving costs to boot Dell technologies.
So,

185
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:56,020
so Google made a big impact in this space.

186
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,291
No.

187
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:04,291
The second observation is
that manufacturing in China
has its unique advantages.

188
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,700
Why is that?
Um,

189
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:12,590
because there's relatively low cost of
Labor's and not raw materials. In China,

190
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:17,180
manufacturing infrastructure,
uh, mature, uh, highways,

191
00:14:17,181 --> 00:14:19,910
roads and paths in China
are well developed.

192
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:25,370
So the litters detailed division of tasks.
So the pipeline of manufacturing,

193
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:30,010
it's very mature. Examples of the, uh,

194
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,780
examples are UV tech,
robotics.

195
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:37,930
They can produce this kind of robotics
in fairly cheaper price than anywhere

196
00:14:38,241 --> 00:14:41,780
else.
Show me is another great example.

197
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:46,990
Show me beauty ecosystem of smart
devices in relatively cheaper price.

198
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:52,160
So the takeaway for the u s startups

199
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:56,750
is that you can leverage this
manufacturing advantages in China.

200
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:02,330
Uh, good examples are lime and birth,
right? They are building this scooters,

201
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,180
which you can see a lot in Santa Monica.
Uh,

202
00:15:05,181 --> 00:15:10,181
actually these scooters are mainly
developed in China and these companies can

203
00:15:10,521 --> 00:15:13,250
cover the cost just whizzing 20 days.

204
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:17,060
Touring is one example.

205
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,150
The company we invested
doing security robots,

206
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,360
it can patrol indoors and outdoors
because the hardware are manufactured in

207
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:30,800
China.
It's 80% cheaper than it's us competitors.

208
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,930
So companies here,

209
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:37,730
she'll try and to leverage the
hardware cost advantage in China.

210
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:43,860
So the third observation
is really important.

211
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,640
So in B two B space,
US startups are stronger.

212
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,810
We're in B two C and B two cheap
Chinese startups are stronger.

213
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,420
Yeah.

214
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:59,420
So we actually calculated the average
founding of the top three startup in each

215
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,280
industry.
Well Ai is applying to,

216
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:09,020
so the first part is the industry is
that US startups raise much more capital

217
00:16:09,901 --> 00:16:13,410
then those in China.
And for the second part,

218
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:17,220
these are industries where
Chinese startups raise more money.

219
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,540
And if we dig into these two parts,

220
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:24,390
we find that these industries are more B,

221
00:16:24,391 --> 00:16:28,500
two B industries where your
customers are typically enterprises.

222
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:34,140
Where the second part your customers
are more like consumers and also

223
00:16:34,141 --> 00:16:34,974
government.

224
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,413
Okay,

225
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:43,780
so let's explain why is that in the u
s B2B ecosystem is well established.

226
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:52,220
That means AI startups can
get access to data easier.

227
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:58,300
You see all kinds of Saas model based
companies are very well developed in the u

228
00:16:58,431 --> 00:17:03,431
s and also AI has a clear
values to enterprises because
AI can help enterprises

229
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,990
to lower the cost to
improve the efficiency.

230
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,350
That's why in the US a lot of enterprises,

231
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:17,300
I try AI technologist to help them.
What about China?

232
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,640
China is different.
In China,

233
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:24,360
US B2B ecosystem is not well established.
The trust,

234
00:17:24,361 --> 00:17:26,120
that ecosystem,
the trust,

235
00:17:26,121 --> 00:17:31,121
the system is not as well as developed
in the u s also because of the low cost

236
00:17:33,171 --> 00:17:34,460
of human labors,

237
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,360
enterprises in China tend to hire more
people instead of trying to using AI to

238
00:17:41,301 --> 00:17:44,270
lower the cost or improve the efficiency.

239
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,410
And also in China,

240
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:52,140
B2c has a higher gross and more data.

241
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:56,880
So startups doing B2C space
can access data much easier.

242
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:03,140
And in China you will see that the mobile
internet users are growing very fast.

243
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:05,710
Okay.

244
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:10,710
The last reason is BTG has a higher
revenue and the more data in China.

245
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,850
So in China,

246
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:16,810
Chinese government is highly
supportive of AI startups.

247
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:20,110
They give a lot of data to
start ups like since time.

248
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,570
So by working with government,

249
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:27,840
these big Ai Unicorns can access more
data and they can also get big contracts

250
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:34,750
from Chinese governments. So this were
drives the high gross of these companies.

251
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:42,510
I want to just talk a little bit
about B two c space in China. Well,

252
00:18:42,511 --> 00:18:44,880
you can access much more data,
right?

253
00:18:44,881 --> 00:18:48,030
If you look at this curve in China,

254
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:53,150
there's three times active mobile devices
than the u s and the number of food.

255
00:18:54,221 --> 00:18:59,221
The delivery orders is much more like 10
times in the u s but this is in 2017 I

256
00:19:00,451 --> 00:19:04,830
think today us has more food delivery,
right? You see like door dash,

257
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,500
Postmates or kind of delivering companies.

258
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:13,070
And also the mobile payments in China
is 50 times than the u s so you can get

259
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:19,860
access to these consumer
based data fairly easily.

260
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:23,550
And you know, AI is building
on data. So this is the key.

261
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,170
Okay,

262
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,670
let me give you some example.

263
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,480
One example in B2b industry is
a robotics process automation.

264
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:33,181
Well,

265
00:19:33,181 --> 00:19:38,181
AI can automating large
amount of repetitive works,

266
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:43,200
right? Um, the typical example is Ui pass.

267
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,410
This company raised about 500 million.

268
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:50,070
Their revenue grow from a
million to a hundred million.

269
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:52,230
We seeing only 21 months.

270
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:56,760
You can see that the USS Enterprise are
paying a lot of money for these type of

271
00:19:56,761 --> 00:20:01,761
company and it has over 2000
enterprise customers globally.

272
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:06,123
Okay?

273
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:11,820
So another B Two B space,
uh, is cybersecurity, right?

274
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:16,850
US enterprises paying a lot of money for
a cybersecurity companies to using AI

275
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:21,960
to help them to detect
and defend these attacks.

276
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:26,640
One company Stripe, uh, crowd strike,

277
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,780
they raised over around four,
500 million.

278
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:36,380
They actually analyze a trillion
events per week and it prevent,

279
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:42,720
uh, about 30 southern purchase
per year. Very significant.

280
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,470
Another example is agriculture.
Well,

281
00:20:47,471 --> 00:20:52,471
the company plenty they can do over
like 300 times crop year old than

282
00:20:55,811 --> 00:20:59,500
traditional farms and
only using 1% of water.

283
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:04,330
So you can see AI plays a significant
role here in terms of improving the

284
00:21:04,331 --> 00:21:05,164
efficiency.

285
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,170
Okay,

286
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,640
that's,
rob has some example.

287
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:13,410
The B two c space where I'll try new
startups is stronger in entertainment is

288
00:21:13,411 --> 00:21:17,100
one example.
You can use AI to do personalization.

289
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:22,430
Using Ai to do intelligent recommendation
by dance is a good example.

290
00:21:22,561 --> 00:21:27,250
As I mentioned,
another industry,

291
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,150
uh, service robotics,
companies like UV tech, uh,

292
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,570
producing this, all kinds of, uh,

293
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:38,320
robotics to solve people to
interact with people. Well,

294
00:21:38,321 --> 00:21:42,850
AI plays an important role of perceiving
the environment and interact with

295
00:21:42,851 --> 00:21:43,684
people.

296
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,520
A good example of Btg is
the physical security space.

297
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:52,010
Well,

298
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:57,010
Chinese government is highly supportive
and give big contracts to startups.

299
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:01,160
Uh,
let's look at some number in China.

300
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,520
117 million security cameras are deployed
and you can expect 400 million more.

301
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:13,780
So there's way more number of security
cameras standing us since time is the

302
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,180
leader in the space.

303
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:22,270
But you also notice other competitors
from China facetime cloud walk R or raised

304
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:29,190
big amount of money. So the
B two g space in China, uh,

305
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,910
it actually attracts a lot of capital.

306
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,180
I also want to mention that B,
two B space in China is booming,

307
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,660
although you see that us
is stronger in B two B,

308
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:46,550
but now Chinese companies are paying
more attention to the space. Why is that?

309
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:51,580
Because the labor costs is increasing
because of the aging population.

310
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,300
Now, enterprises in China, I
pay more attention to cost.

311
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:01,820
Secondly, the far the high
growth of Internet mobile,

312
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:06,620
mobile Internet users are, the
close rate is diminishing. Now,

313
00:23:06,621 --> 00:23:11,240
Chinese companies are looking at the
B to B two B space more because you

314
00:23:11,241 --> 00:23:15,440
couldn't have such big roles
in B, two c anymore, right?

315
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:20,370
For most field. Oh, we're
going to say you some example.

316
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,360
For example,
a you'd be tech,

317
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:27,570
the our buting intelligent inspection
robots that can patrol and find safety

318
00:23:29,021 --> 00:23:32,620
risks.
Since time it's also doing remote sensing.

319
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:37,300
They work on satellite data.
They attract the insights of the data.

320
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,750
Then can apply to
industries like agriculture.

321
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:43,423
Okay.

322
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:48,440
Now the takeaway for the u s is that
if you are doing something in B two B

323
00:23:48,441 --> 00:23:53,240
space, it's huge opportunity
to expand that to China market.

324
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,210
Well example is database.

325
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,270
Visser is a US company backed by sequoia.
Uh,

326
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:07,380
they actually serving a lot of
customers in the u s but also in China.

327
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,090
You can see customers like Alibaba,

328
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,590
Jingdong and some other social apps,
social apps in China,

329
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:19,390
right? Say they started in the u s
but now they expand heavily in China.

330
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:26,080
Another takeaway is that if you are
working on B two C or B two g space,

331
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:31,710
actually you can learn a lot from China's
practice because Chinese startups have

332
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:36,760
tried really hard in these spaces
because B, two B is tougher, right?

333
00:24:36,761 --> 00:24:38,110
They try to hard in B,

334
00:24:38,111 --> 00:24:43,111
two C and B Two g and they have explored
various possibilities in these spaces.

335
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:49,730
That's real. Has some
example. Facial recognition.

336
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:55,990
You can see that facial recognition
technologies in China have been applied to

337
00:24:58,251 --> 00:25:02,960
every industry. You can imagine,
right from uh, education,

338
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:06,830
finance, house, Kale,
entertainment, all tall security,

339
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:11,720
many industries right here.
You can imagine it's way,

340
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,580
way more ahead of us.

341
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:19,410
And that was an interesting example is
the license plate recognition, right?

342
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:23,880
You're going to sing you this as an easier
computer vision task to recognize the

343
00:25:23,881 --> 00:25:26,790
license plate on your car.
Now in China,

344
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,370
many shopping malls have the systems,

345
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,110
this systems where recognize your license
plate when you get into the parking

346
00:25:34,111 --> 00:25:35,820
structure and then we will get out.

347
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:40,530
It will automatically count how much
time you spent and you will pay for it.

348
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,800
Uh, no ticket needed, right?

349
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:48,730
And it improves the whole
traffic flow significantly. Um,

350
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,780
so these systems are
probably using China now,

351
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:56,990
but it's still early in the u s so for
startups in the US it's good to look at

352
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:02,370
some applications in China. Maybe some
of them you can apply to the u s two.

353
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:08,910
Um, another example is the
physical security space.

354
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:13,050
I mentioned this company, we invested,
they are doing security robots.

355
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:16,740
They actually learned a lot
from the PTG space in China.

356
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:22,370
These security robots will patrol
in office spaces during off hours.

357
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:28,260
Um, they would do human detection.
They will not do facial recognition,

358
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:33,120
um, because people will have
less concern about their privacy,

359
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:38,630
but they will detect humans and
see if there's some safety risks.

360
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:43,950
They will also collaborate with the
security guards in the u s so that if

361
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,540
there's some risk discovered,

362
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:50,160
the robot will collaborate with
Scott's to resolve these risks.

363
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:53,853
Okay.

364
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:58,260
Now the force observation we
have is that Chinese Unicorns,

365
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:01,720
I adopt some unique growth strategies.

366
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:06,950
One strategy is the horizontal expansion.
Right?

367
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,590
In China there are some Unicorns,
a pride,

368
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,720
a core AI technologies
to multiple industries.

369
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,880
Since time is one example.

370
00:27:15,881 --> 00:27:20,881
They applying their computer vision
technology to over 10 industries and also

371
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:27,900
saves time sets up its corporate VC to
invest into other strategic partners.

372
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,710
They invest companies doing
entertainment company is doing Ai,

373
00:27:32,711 --> 00:27:35,980
was healthcare company swinging
AI with smarter cities.

374
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:41,520
So since time is actually doing this
horizontal expansion to speed up its whole

375
00:27:43,101 --> 00:27:44,920
grows,
right?

376
00:27:44,921 --> 00:27:48,250
There's a number of other AI union
comes in China doing similar stuff.

377
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:54,120
Well we notice that for most Ai Unicorns
in the u s they are mainly focusing on

378
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:59,350
a vertical because they think it's
more capital efficient, right?

379
00:27:59,351 --> 00:28:04,351
We think the horizontal expansion can
be applied to some USA I startups too,

380
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:05,740
but not all of them.

381
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:07,623
Yeah.

382
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:12,540
The second interesting strategy in China
is called multiple revenue streams.

383
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:16,500
Uh,
AI startups in the U in China,

384
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:20,640
they will provide freemium
models for early adopters.

385
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,030
Okay.

386
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:24,430
But how they make money,
right? If this is free,

387
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,190
they can get revenues from other streams.
That's real cat,

388
00:28:28,191 --> 00:28:32,230
this license plate recognition
system as an example. So in China,

389
00:28:32,231 --> 00:28:35,950
when's these companies? Butte,
these systems, it's hard to,

390
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:40,640
for them to sell to this shopping mall
owners. Right? Because shopping on there,

391
00:28:40,641 --> 00:28:45,520
I don't want to pay much for that. They
say, oh, I don't need you to pay Etsy.

392
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:49,090
I would give it for you,
give it to you for free.

393
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:54,530
But in exchange,
let me put some ads in the entrance.

394
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:59,300
Now they sell the ads advertisements
to other companies to make money.

395
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:00,913
By doing so,

396
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:05,810
it covers their cost by later on where
more and more shopping was half their

397
00:29:05,811 --> 00:29:10,070
systems. It's easier for them to
see all to many other shopping was.

398
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:14,540
So actually this is similar to
the [inaudible] gross strategy.

399
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:18,950
Well like Google provide free
services for consumers, right?

400
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:21,230
So that the adoption can be much faster.

401
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:26,710
So Chinese UNICORNS actually applying
this interesting growth strategy in B two

402
00:29:26,981 --> 00:29:31,070
c space to be B because B
two B in China is so hard.

403
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:36,340
They need to sync clever ways to getting
into the B two c space to accelerate

404
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,793
adoption.

405
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,190
So they

406
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:46,390
try these kinds of growth strategies.
As I said,

407
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:50,860
B two C B two B is tougher. In China,
it's the customer adoption is slow.

408
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:55,780
So they need to expand to multiple
industries as soon as possible.

409
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:00,940
Secondly, there's squirrels,
pressure from investors in China.

410
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:05,130
So in China,
investors used to seek B2C grows,

411
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:09,400
which is more like explanation,
exponent, exponential growth.

412
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,200
We're in B two B space is harder.

413
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,440
So you needed to expand to multiple
industries to achieve faster grows and

414
00:30:17,651 --> 00:30:22,240
suddenly there's high pressure from
the fierce competition in China, right?

415
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:27,600
So since time is actually competing with
these companies in a lot of industries,

416
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:32,350
right? These companies all
raised huge amount of money.

417
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,570
So the competition is really high.

418
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:39,900
So these companies will try to get
into different industries faster than

419
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,190
competitors.

420
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:49,640
Now the takeaway for us startups is
that for some startups you can try

421
00:30:49,641 --> 00:30:51,830
horizontal expansion,
right?

422
00:30:51,831 --> 00:30:56,831
If you have a core technology and this
technology can be applied to multiple

423
00:30:56,961 --> 00:31:00,020
industries,
you may try this kind of growth strategy.

424
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:04,130
Some examples like self
driving technology,

425
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:07,790
we can apply to auto retail security.

426
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:11,150
If you do security robots,
supply chain management,

427
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:15,050
if you can do robots in warehouses,
right?

428
00:31:15,051 --> 00:31:19,760
For robotic process automation
and also for fraud detection,

429
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:25,180
you can try a similar strategy because
it can be applied to many industries.

430
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:31,820
Secondly, the takeaway on
the multiple revenue streams,

431
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:37,060
I think a U S B Two B startups can
think of as a revenue stream than just a

432
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:40,190
customer.
Subscribe your services.

433
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:44,540
This actually can speed up
the customer adoption, right?

434
00:31:44,541 --> 00:31:46,820
If you apply this strategy in the US,

435
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,420
maybe you can go much faster
than your competitors.

436
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:57,780
So lastly, I want to talk about
some opportunities for us startups.

437
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:02,550
So first, uh, you can get into
more markets as I mentioned,

438
00:32:02,551 --> 00:32:07,440
the China and other emerging markets.
So secondly,

439
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:11,920
you as startups can learn from
China's practices, especially in B,

440
00:32:11,921 --> 00:32:15,750
two C and PTG spaces.
Southerly,

441
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:20,070
it's interesting too looking at
industries with less competition.

442
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:25,200
So there are more opportunities for
people to start new AI startups.

443
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:29,310
Forsley a company is true,
the leverage,

444
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:32,310
some new tech trends in AI.

445
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:39,040
Um, so for the third opportunity, uh,

446
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,890
startups can step into
industries with less competition.

447
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:45,410
So we probably the numbers,

448
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:49,940
we find that for certain industries
there's high capital concentration,

449
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,780
meaning startups already
raised large rounds of capital.

450
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:58,550
So the competition can be high. But
for new startups, it's good to look,

451
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:03,470
look at some industries with less
competition. For example, education,

452
00:33:03,471 --> 00:33:08,060
travel, energy, retail space,
tech, aquaculture materials,

453
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,050
and many others.

454
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:14,530
So in this space is no company actually
raised huge around huge round of

455
00:33:15,831 --> 00:33:19,700
capital.
So it's easier for startups to getting to,

456
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:20,960
there's less competition.

457
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:24,980
So maybe it's good to pay
attention to these industries.

458
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:31,750
So the first opportunity is to look
at the new technology trends in Ai.

459
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:35,470
I briefly summarize into three categories.

460
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:40,650
Why is for data processing a Iot Ai
plus Iot edge computing five g these

461
00:33:43,211 --> 00:33:48,211
technology or allow more
real time processing of large
number of large volume of

462
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:53,890
data? A second, the catch
query is computing power.

463
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:59,290
For example, tensor processing unit
GPU, right? It's powered by Google.

464
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:04,680
I think it's a good technology to leverage
to speed up the whole AI computation.

465
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,920
Quantum computing is on the way.
Um,

466
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:12,990
we may still need it to wait a few years
before it's gets more better developed,

467
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:16,210
but it's promising there.

468
00:34:16,211 --> 00:34:20,590
So the category is a new
optimism's again is one example.

469
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:25,210
You can use it to generate
very real fake images.

470
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:26,231
For example,

471
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:31,231
some companies are using again to generate
faked training data for AI systems,

472
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:34,060
right?
You don't need to get a lot of data.

473
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,780
Now you can use the sis algorithm
to generate a more training data.

474
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:43,150
Some companies are thinking of applying
again to do some creation work.

475
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,310
Uh,
transfer learning.

476
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:49,540
When you apply your AI technology
from one industry to others,

477
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:53,950
you can transfer some knowledge you
already learned in wine industry, right?

478
00:34:53,951 --> 00:34:58,540
If you also expand your system
from one country to others,

479
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,710
transfer learning can be also helpful.
Uh,

480
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:07,420
federated running, you
can do collaborative
collaborative machine learning,

481
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:10,450
right? Without centralize
the training data, right?

482
00:35:10,451 --> 00:35:14,800
You can do more like distributed
computing when training a larger system.

483
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,100
Okay.
To summarize today,

484
00:35:20,101 --> 00:35:24,330
I shared with you four key observations.
First,

485
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:28,530
R and D, USAA is ahead of China. Secondly,

486
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:29,970
for manufacturing,

487
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:34,620
China has some advantages
that u s company can leverage.

488
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:38,760
So that a, B, two C, B two
B us is ahead of China,

489
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,780
but in B two C and B to g,
uh,

490
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,730
Chinese car companies
are actually very strong.

491
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:49,140
So it's good for B two B
companies here to expand to China.

492
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:51,460
And also for B,
two C and B,

493
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:56,470
two g industries US startups
can learn from China's success.

494
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,280
The fourth episode,
Asian is Chinese UNICORNS.

495
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:05,270
I adopt unique growth strategies.
I think for most startups in Europe,

496
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,270
in the US,

497
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:11,310
maybe you could learn something from
China's growth strategies so that you can

498
00:36:11,311 --> 00:36:15,040
get faster customer adoption.
Uh,

499
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:19,680
the opportunity is for the u s
companies first go into more markets.

500
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:24,720
Secondly, uh, you can learn
from China's practices. Thirdly,

501
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,210
getting into industries
with less competition.

502
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:33,110
I think there's a huge amount of
opportunities for AI startups to do right?

503
00:36:35,251 --> 00:36:39,390
You can solve big problems in these
industries with less competition.

504
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:44,970
Lastly, pay attention to this new tech
trends and you can leverage some of the

505
00:36:44,971 --> 00:36:49,560
technology to beauty your
Unicom right in the future.

506
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,133
Thank you everyone.

507
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:56,060
[inaudible].
