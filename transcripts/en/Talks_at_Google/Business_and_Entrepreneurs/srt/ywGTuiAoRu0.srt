1
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:11,010
I'm sorry is Marcus Collins and I am
beyond excited to be with you guys.

2
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,270
A little bit more about me. I've a
professor at the Ross School of business.

3
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,350
How about teaches marketing,

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,350
farming go blues and absolutely a warm
audience right now but that's actually

5
00:00:21,991 --> 00:00:22,824
the side kick.

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,390
The full gig cause I work at an
advertising agency called donor based in

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,560
Southfield Eagle.
I work in advertising.

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,790
I'm not necessarily an appetizer by trade.
I was an engineer Undergrad,

9
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,960
ended up leaving engineering
because it wasn't that fun for me.

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,330
No offense to engineers in the room.

11
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,900
They went to the music business before
realizing as are getting a few sucks.

12
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,500
So I came back to school and figure it
all out and then went out to go work at

13
00:00:46,501 --> 00:00:47,334
apple,

14
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:52,770
Beyonce in the advertising industry and
right now in the space I'm working in is

15
00:00:52,771 --> 00:00:57,300
this notion of customer connections
that is understanding the Bobby media

16
00:00:57,301 --> 00:01:01,890
landscape. That is the technology that
we use is shit's data about ourselves,

17
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:03,210
which you guys know very,
very well.

18
00:01:03,211 --> 00:01:06,000
Obviously understanding
the behavioral sciences.

19
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:10,050
It is the causality based theory that
God's the behavior that we take one and

20
00:01:10,051 --> 00:01:12,360
lastly having a very close
proximity to culture.

21
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,570
Now I thought about coming to visit you
guys to speak with you today. Is that,

22
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,860
what did you tell Google?

23
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,390
What do you talk about it the folks at
Google and figure I talked to you about a

24
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:23,580
very simple concrete

25
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,420
concept perspective.

26
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,730
Now I love perspective because we've
talked about a lot and we all have one but

27
00:01:32,731 --> 00:01:36,780
really kind of boils down to this for
me that things aren't the way they are.

28
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,890
These are the way that we are.

29
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,910
That is the way we see the world ought to
be informed how we behave in the world,

30
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,870
the lens that we have. I would just
see the world influences the behaviors.

31
00:01:45,871 --> 00:01:49,100
Got me to take all that and the beautiful
part about this is that we can look at

32
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:53,490
the exact same thing for two told him
perspectives is e two totally different

33
00:01:53,491 --> 00:01:54,140
things.

34
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:58,200
Here's a way to tangibilize this tape for
us is my guards Georgia whitetail deer.

35
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:00,480
I guess she's the best and
even when she's like this,

36
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,570
Georgia is a fish,
like she loves to swim.

37
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,150
I take full credit for this.
My wife's over there

38
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,170
because,
but she was an infant.

39
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:18,210
We took to the whole idea of one of
these doctors check. There she goes.

40
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,510
She gets some air time

41
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:29,130
on the perfect. Yeah, no.

42
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,630
Here's how I saw it.
This is my perspective and I saw that.

43
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,770
I know George in the air just a little
bit. Nothing alarming. Just a little bit.

44
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,650
Droid maybe she started a little
bit higher and why? Why is

45
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,600
kill your child

46
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,950
so all the matter of perspective,

47
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,890
the way you said the world wants me
informs how you behave in the world.

48
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,660
Now I talked to you about perspective,

49
00:02:51,661 --> 00:02:56,661
particularly about cultural now called
just one of those words that we use often

50
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,580
we talk about it and with
the media and celebrities,

51
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:04,030
like that's culture or if you're your
company you saying we have a foosball

52
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:07,770
table in the office. We have a great
culture here. We absorbed summer Fridays.

53
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,710
I have a great culture, but those
things are bipods and culture. Culture.

54
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:14,020
I make me buy it from the
perspective of anthropology.

55
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,720
Anthropologists describe
culture base look for things.

56
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:21,820
The other beliefs that we hold,
they all of the artifacts that we died,

57
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:26,740
the rituals, the social norms that we
hear too in the language that we use,

58
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:27,603
the lexicon,

59
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,480
the dialect and when these four themes
are adopted him on the plot as a people

60
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,330
is there to represent their culture,
right?

61
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,710
Getting tons of different ways and
that best in their nationality,

62
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,330
ethnicity definitely the religious they
subscribe to and oftentimes the passion

63
00:03:43,331 --> 00:03:44,770
points that they hold dear.

64
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:50,070
Right and we use iconography to describe
and to project the cultures that we are

65
00:03:51,911 --> 00:03:56,911
part of the cultures that we ascribe too
much like a peacock spreads is weeks to

66
00:03:57,041 --> 00:04:01,180
meet. We do the exact same thing when it
comes to the brands that we hold dear.

67
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,200
Now Look, you guys are smart.
Obviously you said you like look is,

68
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:08,620
this is totally obvious but the obvious
use isn't top use until someone points

69
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:13,180
it out to, for instance, say someone's
going to get some headphones, headphones.

70
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,800
I go into target.

71
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,010
There's a long line of handball is
all the headphones look the same.

72
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,900
They all kind of have
the same sort of shape.

73
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,840
Which one are people most
likely to buy? Beads, right?

74
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,160
That just met,
but we know.

75
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,020
We know there's because beats is
the Silhouette America, right?

76
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,270
People need to listen to music using
beats assistance artifact that we wear

77
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:39,220
around our neck to say,
this is who I am.

78
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,300
These are the cultures that I subscribe
to. Now the beats bear the bowls. Yeah.

79
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,260
Yes.
It wasn't a die hard.

80
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,960
I want you to know is beats bear to Jbl.
They're my clients.

81
00:04:51,961 --> 00:04:53,220
Like definitely say no.

82
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,840
Right? In fact, a couple of years ago,

83
00:04:56,841 --> 00:04:59,420
someone dissected a pair of beats
by dre headphones and power.

84
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:04,240
Don't take $70 to make a beats by dre
headphones. They will see their delight.

85
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,360
It's no wonder then

86
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,090
why they dominate the market.

87
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,760
It's not because of the value propositions
of the products is because of the

88
00:05:16,761 --> 00:05:20,630
brands prox that needs a culture because
culture sidesteps all the conventional

89
00:05:20,631 --> 00:05:22,490
wisdoms that we know of or think about,

90
00:05:22,491 --> 00:05:26,060
we think about marketing is more
powerful than my razor sharper.

91
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,080
My battery last longer, my car
goes faster, it has more body,

92
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,990
my dealer would get too late.
Right?

93
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:37,230
It's more powerful than all those themes
because culture is associated with your

94
00:05:37,231 --> 00:05:38,064
identity,

95
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,290
the way we see ourselves and
how we want to be seen as big.

96
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,110
He once said,
if you don't know

97
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,830
what this is, Chris, a
little bit tiles, right? Uh,

98
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:52,800
what did they call it?

99
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,620
And we know that

100
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,780
Ms. Harding be introduced that language
to us in her record. Hold on, go.

101
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,110
Right, which wouldn't number one on
billboard I killed, murdered, I'll be war.

102
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,380
Right? That would be a burden on
billboard when Cardi B with number one,

103
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:19,550
the black yellow,

104
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:24,730
she also saw a 217% increase in search
traffic for crystal blue of the times,

105
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:31,030
which was equate to about four point
$5 million of media about the culture

106
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:37,380
drives covers. And if you don't know, no,

107
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:43,140
he has no, this is Jordan, right?
It's okay. You should stop yourself.

108
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,990
Store brand story.
But what else does it called jump man.

109
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,940
Jump Man. And he hit 2016 full
jumped over John [inaudible].

110
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,060
Yeah, man, it's way into the
culture back here. By the way,

111
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,420
let me translate this for you.

112
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:06,010
Adidas boot for beating number three,
shoe manufacturer,

113
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:11,040
sneaker manufacturer in the country
and over to brand Jordan in 2012 right?

114
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,150
Kevin, number two and a lot of us is
tribute to what they call the easy effect,

115
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,120
kind of knit the easy's
and just dominate things.

116
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:22,120
It was also attributed to for
rail in Stan Smith, right?

117
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:26,010
And just actually Q 12 Adidas,

118
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,750
Nike execute 12 cells.
This isn't the first time we've seen this.

119
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,580
We also saw it with run DMC.

120
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,650
The impact on culture drives commerce.

121
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:41,580
You guys know this guy, right? Of course
you don't just got the most evil rapper

122
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:47,250
best tossing myself, right? You can't
go anywhere without hearing a drink.

123
00:07:47,251 --> 00:07:52,251
Predator drank is the guy and we know
that Drake is very closely connected to

124
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:57,980
his beloved city of Toronto and just
recently in fact somebody acquainted the

125
00:07:58,861 --> 00:08:02,940
value of Drake on the
economic power of tomato.

126
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,060
That tricks talking 5% of the economy.

127
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:11,460
It's wrong because there's the six
barbershop cause the sixth restaurant does

128
00:08:11,461 --> 00:08:15,000
the sixth Nelson Law and all of this
language that was introduced by trade that

129
00:08:15,001 --> 00:08:19,650
is ridiculously powerful,
unreal, powerful.

130
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:24,120
This what culture does.
This is the impact of culture.

131
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,030
The beliefs that we hold,
the artifacts that we've done,

132
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,790
the behaviors we take on and
the language that we use.

133
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,490
This is culture with a capital c
is this is just good pop potion.

134
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:37,950
Dog Argue that American culture is hip
hop culture like the evils of hip hop is.

135
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:42,600
I came from nothing to something and I'm
stunned knowing you is exact what I'm,

136
00:08:42,601 --> 00:08:46,920
every culture is pull us up by
bootstraps now starting on you,

137
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,353
right,

138
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,080
which is no wonder why hip hop music is
the number one most custom Java in the

139
00:08:52,081 --> 00:08:55,770
country. When we talk about cultural meat
culture with a capital C for instance,

140
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,560
go back to 2000 feet right in
the middle of financial crisis,

141
00:08:58,561 --> 00:09:03,561
2008 and you had an uprising of people
who felt like capitalism was a very,

142
00:09:05,881 --> 00:09:09,060
very bad thing, so much so that
they wanted to be counterculture.

143
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:13,080
We're going to be completely antithetical
to the capitalistic culture that we

144
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:16,950
lived in and we call these
people affectionately hipsters.

145
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:21,600
My hip was all about pushing
against what we know of capitalism,

146
00:09:21,601 --> 00:09:26,550
pushing against what we know of adorning
ourselves with material so we can

147
00:09:26,551 --> 00:09:31,380
express ourselves freely. They dawn,
uh, artifacts that were irreverent.

148
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,920
There are ironic in some cases,
you guys bought cars,

149
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,320
they bought ridiculous bikes
and the whole nine, right?

150
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:41,280
We're fixed rate the whole night.
What was the drink of choice for hipsters,

151
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:45,660
adult beverage stream choice. Pbr. Pbr.

152
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,720
Right now why can we are cause is and
the brand is all about your military

153
00:09:52,351 --> 00:09:56,820
museum. They're all about individual
expression that eat those up.

154
00:09:56,821 --> 00:10:00,510
The brand was completely connected
to what the hipster community,

155
00:10:00,511 --> 00:10:02,280
the hipster culture was all about.

156
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:07,170
They found a uniting force based on
the conviction that they both share and

157
00:10:07,171 --> 00:10:09,840
everyone who consider themselves
a hipster, we're drinking PBR.

158
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,410
Now you can look at that and say,
wow, that's it. It's pretty good.

159
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:13,244
It's pretty interesting.

160
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:18,210
But the impact on [inaudible] business
was through the roof hockey stick growth

161
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:22,770
at the time of the uprising
of this culture that we
all call hipsters. So much.

162
00:10:22,771 --> 00:10:26,880
So attorney PBR until $1 billion business,
which is ridiculous.

163
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,310
And you can say that by, but what
would the rest of the market doing?

164
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,990
Let's tell you what the
rest of our was doing.

165
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:35,950
Everyone else was either
declining or flat lining. Well,

166
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:40,350
PBI was murdered. You
don't know. I didn't know.

167
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:45,410
We also know this when we
think about proposing, but
we propose with the diamond,

168
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:50,090
right? And why do both of
the diamond, I'm sorry,

169
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,470
but it was the diamond question mark.

170
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:56,270
Diamond diamond lasts forever.
And who told us that?

171
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,790
The beers. Yes. Beer say
diamonds are forever.

172
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,760
So if you love her,
do you love your loved one?

173
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:08,240
You're going to get a diamond and you
know you've been up close with a ruby.

174
00:11:08,241 --> 00:11:09,290
She's like,
you're going to get up

175
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:17,420
close with the diamond because diamond's
last forever because diamonds are

176
00:11:17,421 --> 00:11:18,080
forever.

177
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,830
So much so that as much as long as you
have that person save up three months of

178
00:11:21,831 --> 00:11:26,600
your salary to show the love, then
this rock that lasts forever. Well,

179
00:11:26,601 --> 00:11:29,720
I'll tell you why the beers tells you
that to last forever because the resale

180
00:11:29,721 --> 00:11:31,430
value for time is actually pretty awful.

181
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:36,920
And they have a monopoly on of
seemingly monopoly on diamonds.

182
00:11:36,921 --> 00:11:40,900
So they constrict the supply,
it took their last rep or dope,

183
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:44,210
they'll resell it because
you'll see that this is bogus.

184
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,250
And as a result,

185
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:51,620
when this campaign hit the market in
the 1930s you started to propose the

186
00:11:51,621 --> 00:11:55,360
diamond and we see the same thing happen
in Japan and they rolled out the same

187
00:11:55,361 --> 00:11:56,194
campaign.

188
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,660
Brands have an impact on
culture and impacting commerce.

189
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,130
And if you don't know,

190
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:08,440
we also see this and think about smiles.
You ever wonder why?

191
00:12:08,441 --> 00:12:13,210
Back in the day people were mean mugging
and their photos and their portraits.

192
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,480
And then today we can't stop
smiling were all smiles, right?

193
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,290
The Kanye has some issues with this.

194
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,390
No one can say, well that's because
back in the day people's photos,

195
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:26,951
it was pictures.

196
00:12:26,951 --> 00:12:30,820
We're taking the portrait and took a
long time and you can't hold a smile.

197
00:12:30,821 --> 00:12:31,251
That law,

198
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:35,230
like their face gets 15 muskeg tea and
people kind of straight look the whole

199
00:12:35,231 --> 00:12:38,620
time.
But even with the advent of cameras,

200
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:43,510
people still to very grim
grimace looking photos.

201
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:47,140
This wasn't because of the technology,
this is because of the culture.

202
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:52,650
The belief at the time was that the idea
of smiling and photos are in portraits

203
00:12:52,901 --> 00:12:57,790
was child life was halfwit. You're
less thing. That was the belief,

204
00:12:57,791 --> 00:13:00,730
which is why the first federal,
all of the standing president,

205
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:05,540
they do like he belonged to a conference
on there. I'm completely not happening.

206
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:10,060
No Julie happening there and even at
the turn of the century where cameras

207
00:13:10,061 --> 00:13:12,820
became much more ubiquitous and
more people have access to them,

208
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,880
we still didn't smell very much in photos.

209
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:20,530
So if you are a camera company that
makes your business from people buying

210
00:13:20,531 --> 00:13:23,200
cameras and buying film and
take a lot for lots of pictures,

211
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,080
people think of taking
photos as a serious business.

212
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,810
They're not taking a lot of
photos in that situation for you.

213
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,990
So Eastman Kodak say, we
got to change this up, man.

214
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:36,340
We have to reposition how people think
about what photos are meant to be.

215
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,760
Say to just the idea of the Kodak moment,

216
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,800
taking the photos about capturing,
preserving these joyous moments.

217
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:48,250
It's about preserving these moments
that we have picked up love.

218
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:52,690
So much saw that we say, Jeez,
when we smile and take photos,

219
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:56,500
completely changed.
Not only the belief but the behavior.

220
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:00,520
And fortunately when this rolled
out the turn of the century,

221
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:04,250
it measured very close to their line up
very closely with a study that was done

222
00:14:04,251 --> 00:14:05,860
in one year were polls,
well,

223
00:14:05,861 --> 00:14:10,861
it's up your photos over a century's time
and measure the curvatures of faces in

224
00:14:10,901 --> 00:14:15,100
the fellows to see how often or how much
people were smiling and we saw more and

225
00:14:15,101 --> 00:14:17,830
more, we smile. This is what we do.

226
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,240
Which is why that guy now looks like a,

227
00:14:21,241 --> 00:14:26,230
this kind of gun and the results of
it was massive for coatings business.

228
00:14:26,231 --> 00:14:31,000
Almost $6 billion collected
was 2005 unfortunately,

229
00:14:31,001 --> 00:14:34,180
they miss a cultural shift
shift kind of play themselves.

230
00:14:34,181 --> 00:14:39,010
You know how that ended up right? That's
a good, right? So why does this matter?

231
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:42,580
Why does any of this matter?
I tell you why it matters.

232
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:46,370
It matters because France who could
culture are more successful than those who

233
00:14:46,371 --> 00:14:49,570
follow. That is branching,
push culture forward.

234
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:53,650
Brands who contribute the
culture almost [inaudible] file,

235
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,540
they can ship it to the beliefs,
the artifacts, but dawn,

236
00:14:56,541 --> 00:15:00,980
the lames were taking on behaviors.
We take on the brands who lead that,

237
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:04,220
push it forward and people use those
brands that communicates with develop

238
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:08,750
themselves. Whether it's
apple, Nike, whole foods,

239
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:12,470
Starbucks, people get tattoos of
a Harley Davidson on your body.

240
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,710
You'll see my but I was not
in his tattoo on her body.

241
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:21,520
We use these brands to communicate our
identity and we understand the impact of

242
00:15:22,341 --> 00:15:23,660
culture on commerce.

243
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,980
We can then superimpose it with what we
know of human behavior and this is what

244
00:15:27,981 --> 00:15:29,240
we're imposed that well,

245
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:34,270
we know of people's behavior based on
the shedding of data to take on and allow

246
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:38,700
us to better connect with consumers.
We know who the ability off.

247
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,710
Here's a few examples of this in action.

248
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:46,370
So Netflix is one of our clients at donor.
And Netflix came to us and say, Hey,

249
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:50,270
you want a lost into season five
of house of cards. It's, you know,

250
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:53,000
it's got a lot of momentum happening.
Things are going well. Listen,

251
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:54,500
this is in the middle of the most,

252
00:15:55,250 --> 00:16:00,250
the most divisive drama field election
cycle we probably have ever seen,

253
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,460
at least in our lifetime.

254
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,770
So how might we be a
part of this cultural,

255
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:09,560
how might we be a part
of the conversation?

256
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,980
So we took on the assignment and we say,
well, what coal be could we lean into?

257
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,700
What can we take advantage of? And the
first thing we thought about was, well,

258
00:16:16,701 --> 00:16:20,630
the actual logo,
the shell upside down,

259
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:25,100
what and what does it upside down?
One flag signaling distress.

260
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,090
Exactly right.

261
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:31,660
Culturally we know that upside down
flag means trouble's a brewing help.

262
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:37,960
So we thought what more opportune time
then to launch the teaser for the season

263
00:16:40,071 --> 00:16:44,270
five, a house of cards, a new season.

264
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,620
Then here.

265
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:51,610
So during the inauguration
of president Trump, uh,

266
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,180
we launched this little ticket.

267
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,110
I don't have

268
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,670
liberty and justice.

269
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,020
So zero media behind it,
which I know it's not heard,

270
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,680
these guys behind it.

271
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:32,850
We saw 100,000 shares per hour for the
first 18 hours of launching this thing.

272
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,140
Not because it was so radical,

273
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:39,620
but because it had a place
in contribute to the culture,

274
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,470
which allowed people to communicate
how they feel, which is ridiculous.

275
00:17:43,471 --> 00:17:46,160
Really powerful.
Now you can look at how the car to say,

276
00:17:46,161 --> 00:17:48,770
let's party culture development.
That's a cheap as a cheat code.

277
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:53,290
This is something that's not as
culture development. Hopital I,

278
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,780
he's will populate. Yes. Thank you.

279
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,540
So potbelly potbelly for those who
don't know what didn't say yes,

280
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:03,300
papa as a sandwich shop,
right? They sell sandwiches.

281
00:18:03,301 --> 00:18:07,220
Zell toasted sandwiches
handed, uh, headed, uh,

282
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:12,450
milkshakes and daily big cookies.
Tm. Right? So that's, that's,

283
00:18:12,451 --> 00:18:14,840
that's pot belly. Now pop
Bella came, as I said,

284
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,860
we want to tell better
stories about the brand.

285
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,730
We want to move from being this kind of
like culty kind of iconic brand or coach

286
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:24,000
Kinda brings what iconic brand bring more
people in and so forth. We asked him,

287
00:18:24,001 --> 00:18:26,610
I was like, well, what do you
believe? Like, why do you exist?

288
00:18:26,611 --> 00:18:30,240
What's the North Star that guides
you? And they said, well, you know,

289
00:18:30,241 --> 00:18:33,690
we believe in fresh ingredients.
We believe that tastier sandwiches.

290
00:18:33,691 --> 00:18:36,780
Like I didn't know that's what you do.
Why do you do it? What's the belief?

291
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,260
Very sinus setting kind of
approach. You said, well you know,

292
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,880
they'll know after spending
some time with the CTL.

293
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:45,330
Was Biz town founder
promising? No, basically,

294
00:18:45,331 --> 00:18:47,880
I mean it sounds to me people
happy and make people happy.

295
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:52,040
Making these sandwiches.
That made me happy. So it was
happiness about, so we said,

296
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:55,350
well there it is, then you're not in
the business of making sandwiches.

297
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:59,220
In the business of happiness was,
we need to shift your perspective,

298
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:02,610
the way you see the world from being
in the sandwich business to be in the

299
00:19:02,611 --> 00:19:03,450
happiness business.

300
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,140
So we took their communications
and Turner for being good food.

301
00:19:07,141 --> 00:19:11,980
Good vibes to be just mine,
right? You'll just be to Belize.

302
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,210
We'd be,
the smiles were all about happiness.

303
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,660
So the question now became
so poor and we go after,

304
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,400
what do we target are these
guys don't have a lot of money,

305
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:24,180
they just don't write whatever currency
I have in my pocket right now is

306
00:19:24,181 --> 00:19:28,800
probably more than a marketing
budget now about 20 books right now.

307
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:32,040
A lot of money. So we thought, well let's
start with the people who love you most.

308
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:35,400
The people who are a part
of your email distribution,

309
00:19:35,401 --> 00:19:39,270
they are the most ravenous fans. They
love the brand. Who are those people?

310
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,570
Unfortunately for us, they had a list
of, they call them the sandwich board,

311
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:45,390
New People when they
sin rebates to the test,

312
00:19:45,391 --> 00:19:48,240
new products with them like
this is like their people.

313
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:52,620
So we said give us those email addresses
and we took those email addresses and

314
00:19:52,621 --> 00:19:56,790
we converted to the associating
Twitter handles and the idea was like,

315
00:19:56,791 --> 00:20:01,791
let's find out who these people are
beyond being hardcore sandwiched fans.

316
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:07,470
So with Crimson Hexagon, which is
a an AI consumer insight platform,

317
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:12,030
we built this prototype and networking
mapping tool that allow us to take those

318
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,740
email addresses or it's 200 handles,

319
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,610
don't them into the tool and see what
these people have in common. Right?

320
00:20:17,611 --> 00:20:21,240
So this is a rendering of it. So we take
these in all of these Twitter handles,

321
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:24,440
don't them into the tool and we started
seeing the connectivity between them,

322
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:29,400
the clusters that you see
our conversations not about
sandwiches or how these

323
00:20:29,401 --> 00:20:31,800
are happening in their life that are
happening in culture and things of that

324
00:20:31,801 --> 00:20:34,380
nature to get a better understanding
of who those people are.

325
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,110
And in doing this exercise
we saw four things,

326
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:41,700
four names that were disproportionate to
these people versus the rest of Twitter.

327
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,610
And here's the rarely are the first one.

328
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:48,720
There were hardcore sports fans and
truly believe that was very discriminated

329
00:20:48,721 --> 00:20:51,680
because I like a lot of people
like sports. So I was like, ah,

330
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,710
don't know we had any
right to be part of that.

331
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:58,760
Then we saw Christians and
he was like hardcore, like
Joel Olsen, happy Christmas.

332
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:02,530
What does break is a happy brand or
the client. I think we answered that.

333
00:21:02,531 --> 00:21:07,390
So we kept them. We saw some tech
start up, some Martech in particular,

334
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,030
the way it feel like what we had
any right to be here. Part of that.

335
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:13,320
But then we saw,
and we'll talk about music now again,

336
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:14,880
music is not very discriminating.

337
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,990
Everyone likes me is I haven't
haven't been somewhat in life.

338
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:21,330
We said I hate music because we need
that person. There are monster stay away.

339
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,930
Everyone likes music. So it's not
very discriminating on the surface,

340
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,930
but we look closer to the things
that are being shared. We saw it,

341
00:21:27,931 --> 00:21:29,630
they were sharing soundcloud files,

342
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:35,560
which is really small in
comparison to Spotify or youtube or

343
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,130
very,
very small.

344
00:21:42,131 --> 00:21:45,070
So that was up to for discriminating
get particularly sound cloud.

345
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,500
These aren't usually signed.
Ours.

346
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,360
Underground artists is a
way to discover you artists.

347
00:21:49,361 --> 00:21:53,470
So we felt that music is probably a good
avenue for us to get into the culture,

348
00:21:53,471 --> 00:21:57,730
particularly because we have live
musicians who play during lunch.

349
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,350
So now we got away in.

350
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:02,770
So we came up with some ideas with the
client and we pitched the idea is that we

351
00:22:02,771 --> 00:22:06,140
love that, that, that, that give you
some of that. And the idea was like,

352
00:22:06,141 --> 00:22:09,840
let's go test and stuff. Now usually
you get a focus group of people,

353
00:22:09,841 --> 00:22:12,560
let's look at the work and say I like
that and I'll buy that because I liked

354
00:22:12,561 --> 00:22:13,660
that work.
What's typically,

355
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,450
they're all lying because self
reported data is terribly flawed,

356
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:21,740
at least biased.
So instead of asking people,

357
00:22:21,741 --> 00:22:25,580
cause we didn't have money to get it
wrong, what does that to ask their bodies.

358
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,450
So you part of the Michigan states,

359
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:32,480
you advertise in a psychology lab and we
volume respondence to look at the work

360
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:36,620
that we were proposing in a
full Facebook like environment.

361
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:40,580
So he saw some regular content and
then the work that we're proposing.

362
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:44,480
So regular content in the work that we're
proposing and all of these respondents

363
00:22:44,481 --> 00:22:48,170
were there tracking or taking
their physiological response,

364
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,210
swept lambs,

365
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:55,330
heart cardio activity or
respiratory activity. Um,

366
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:58,890
eye tracking, zygomatic muscle, which
can smile muscle. And we were at Trinity,

367
00:22:58,891 --> 00:23:03,260
but we knew of the psychological drivers
to those physiological manifestations

368
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:06,770
and the work that performed the best.
That's the work we put in the market,

369
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:11,160
making great sandwiches that
make people really, really happy.

370
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:12,570
It's Papeles mission,

371
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:16,890
but how do you own that position in the
social sphere when your annual revenue

372
00:23:16,891 --> 00:23:18,870
is less than your competitor's ad budget?

373
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:24,800
We mounted data tech and genuine
happiness to feed smiles across the web.

374
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:30,180
First, we set our sights and arguably
the most unhappy place ever. Twitter,

375
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:35,130
there were a partnership with Crimson
Hexagon in AI powered consumer insights

376
00:23:35,131 --> 00:23:35,964
platform.

377
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:41,100
We identified a hundred sad tweets and
had pot belly musicians respond with a

378
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:45,120
hundred original happy songs in real time,
all during one lunch day.

379
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:49,910
Turn that frown upside down
when we learn Pollis fish died.

380
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,380
We entertained her with this.

381
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:56,560
Sorry to get about your fish at
mag moles fell out of a tree. Yeah,

382
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:01,160
it's sweet. I'm glad.
No matter the problem,

383
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:02,780
we had a happy response.

384
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:06,760
Just going to tell you
you all the very best.

385
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,800
He flooded Twitter with
smile songs and Twitter. Wow.

386
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,710
They smiled back with the
good vibes didn't end there.

387
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:17,480
We helped entire cities in need of
happiness by creating the smile scale.

388
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:22,100
A one of a kind algorithm that synthesizes
everything from weather and traffic

389
00:24:22,101 --> 00:24:26,660
data to results from major sporting
events and social media happenings across

390
00:24:26,661 --> 00:24:30,260
key cities than automatically
serves customized pieces of content.

391
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:36,260
If it's raining in Dallas, they get
this. If traffic is bad in Chicago,

392
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,580
they see this and if Detroit's
favorite baseball team loses,

393
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:45,590
we cheer them up with this. The results,
10 times more brand engagements,

394
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,480
20 times more Twitter followers.

395
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:51,470
Overall we spread happiness to
more than 16 million people.

396
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,930
That's a whole lot of smiles.

397
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:02,390
The more important part of this is
that with only $60,000 media spin,

398
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:07,820
we saw 2.8% increase a store
fabric for the stores that we did.

399
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:11,450
The smile scale occupations, which
is ridiculously powerful. Right?

400
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:15,890
It's crazy crazy. Taking what
we know of behavioral sciences,

401
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:20,600
applying them to what we normally welcome
to the landscape and finding a vehicle

402
00:25:20,601 --> 00:25:23,960
and access licensed to be
a part of culture. Now,

403
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:28,040
Netflix kind of sexy pop valley,
not so much, but sort of fun.

404
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:31,850
Let's get like really
brass tacks like CPG.

405
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:36,550
But this is not sexy by any stretch.
Let's Talk Pharma.

406
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:41,450
The Pharma, so far, my,

407
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:45,380
their apartment in fracture, right?
They Bacon. Awesome. Delicious.

408
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:51,080
Right now you're looking at an import
manufacturer like farmland. You say, well,

409
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:55,520
there's nothing cool about Pharma.
So soft farmland is a praying together.

410
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:58,970
They have no interaction whatsoever.

411
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:02,690
The hypebeast like supreme and
a port factual like format.

412
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,570
A lot of people don't know about what
would they have in common? Probably like,

413
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:06,583
I don't know.

414
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:10,790
So the question becomes
then what do you do?

415
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,280
Or what could be done?

416
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:18,050
Typically nothing until a brand
like supreme. Jack's your logo.

417
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:19,431
So supreme,

418
00:26:19,431 --> 00:26:24,320
notorious for taking other people's
Ip and conquest in it for their own.

419
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:28,740
Uh, they took the local compliance
and we saw this like what do they do?

420
00:26:28,741 --> 00:26:32,320
What do you think? It's illegal.
You can't do this, let's a brain.

421
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,640
But what they can, because they're
gonna do whatever you want to do.

422
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:38,960
And in those cases you have three choices.
You could either litigate,

423
00:26:38,961 --> 00:26:41,700
but as you'll see some assist you get us.
Ignore it most.

424
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:45,480
Most people do because suffering
doesn't care. Or third,

425
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:50,230
you could join it as we decide
to do the guys from Stock X.

426
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,110
Imitation is the highest form of flattery.

427
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:00,760
Then supreme is truly
a world class kiss ass.

428
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:04,760
The legendary street wear company has a
long history of borrowing designs from

429
00:27:04,761 --> 00:27:08,980
other brands and last week they added
another instinct classic. So their legacy,

430
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:12,160
the week one horizon has
dropped it without much fanfare,

431
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:16,960
despite bearing a striking resemblance
to the farm land bull to logo and

432
00:27:16,961 --> 00:27:18,580
Missouri based pork producer,

433
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:22,390
probably be least
hypebeast company on earth.

434
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:26,350
That wasn't until Friday when the ad
roll business giant took to Twitter and

435
00:27:26,351 --> 00:27:30,970
called out the apparent forgery causing
horizon at prices to immediately pop.

436
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
The hats went from $70 before the tweet
to as much as $100 after a 40% increase

437
00:27:38,021 --> 00:27:38,740
over night.

438
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:43,740
Proving once again that street where
loves a scandal and controversy is the

439
00:27:44,021 --> 00:27:46,270
cousin of hype turning off,
it'll be gay.

440
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:51,330
So we saw them Chakra, a logo
responding in sweet. And uh,

441
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:55,020
somewhat surprisingly like
Twitter crazy like Yo,

442
00:27:57,970 --> 00:27:59,800
lots of energy,
lots of excitement.

443
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:03,580
But we didn't stop there because we
knew that car you hit Supreme's I'll do

444
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:06,940
another drop the following week.
We just have to do our own drop.

445
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:12,180
That is farm land opened up an Instagram
handle and we traded a look book where

446
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,010
we don our

447
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:15,203
farmers.

448
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:22,050
Our farmers are out there doing
what they do decked out here.

449
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:25,750
Okay.

450
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:28,810
All right. As the trades were
saying, we out supreme supreme

451
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:33,000
just got picked up and culture
got picked up in the trades.

452
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:36,290
It's got pick up in the hype piece
still just amazing, amazing stuff.

453
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:38,490
This is good. See everybody the best, uh,

454
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:41,070
the best payback to base that
was done the last couple months.

455
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:46,140
But this is really where it's at. How did
we find what we know of human behavior?

456
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:50,310
We know the evolving media landscape
though we know of culture to connect with

457
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:51,900
people in a real meaningful way.

458
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:57,350
I think about my job ultimately is to
translate culture for brands and they

459
00:28:57,811 --> 00:29:02,490
translate brands for the culture
in such a way that they connect,

460
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,080
enroll meaningful ways.

461
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,600
And luckily I have a chance to do that
with some of the biggest brands in the

462
00:29:06,601 --> 00:29:11,160
world, which has been awesome. No, that's
me. But why does that matter for you?

463
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:14,400
I tell you what matters
for you because cultural,

464
00:29:14,401 --> 00:29:19,300
I was getting much closer to humanity
to connect with people in a really

465
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,180
meaningful way and what the literature
is showing us more and more the research

466
00:29:23,181 --> 00:29:27,290
is demonstrating that people care less
about the product benefits and care more

467
00:29:27,291 --> 00:29:32,100
about emotional connection. Our ability
to connect with humanity matters.

468
00:29:32,101 --> 00:29:35,610
Mormon, how Sarma right. Three
is how long our battery last,

469
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,220
how much body is in our sample.

470
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:43,150
People care about human connections
and also drives a cash register.

471
00:29:43,871 --> 00:29:48,610
We just pretty good but it's also
better to you individually as well.

472
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:51,250
I tell you what,
you know,

473
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:55,840
especially for people who
are just starting their
career or new meal fights in

474
00:29:55,841 --> 00:29:56,674
their career,

475
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:01,630
trying to figure it out were costly
to try to find a way to our game.

476
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,590
What's our strategic advantage at work
so I can rise up the ranks so I can be

477
00:30:05,591 --> 00:30:09,640
more successful and I would argue that
understanding cultural is a really

478
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:13,540
powerful way to do that because like
I know, I know you're surprised,

479
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,570
but I used to get in back
in the day [inaudible]

480
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:22,790
I was a songwriter for a living. I
released music. That's why I did.

481
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:27,800
I used to form opened up for what 12
jagged edge Gisa call like those days are

482
00:30:27,801 --> 00:30:28,634
behind me.

483
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,350
I have a three and a half
year old attorney for for
and 14 and it seems like I

484
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:36,140
am my wife and my daughter.
We live on a cul de sac

485
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:40,560
and sometimes we're matching outfits to
get forward them on to our sandwiches

486
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:45,020
are like really,
really hard to be a part of it culture.

487
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:47,550
But for a lot of you,
especially you,

488
00:30:47,551 --> 00:30:51,090
y'all know about Kodak did a good bit
of a pullback kilo. A lot of people,

489
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,840
articles, culture. If that
becomes your superpower,

490
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:58,230
that becomes your differentiator.
You think about your career,

491
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,330
how do you succeed in
the world of marketing?

492
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:04,910
You love it to culture because brands
will be cultural. The and follow.

493
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:09,690
You have that power right now, especially
those who are close to it. You know,

494
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,120
if like this guy,
you have all the tools available to you,

495
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:22,630
most of the culture,
stay close,

496
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:26,150
stay close to the
culture and stay curious.

497
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:31,690
This would be the differentiator that
helps your brands succeed by pushing the

498
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,420
contrary to the culture,
pushing it forward. Hope this
is helpful. Thanks so much

499
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:40,790
[inaudible].

500
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,010
Thanks for coming. I always tried
to get into your class and Ross,

501
00:31:45,011 --> 00:31:46,310
but I never had enough big toys.

502
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,780
I'm curious if you could get any examples
of brands and trying to be like the

503
00:31:52,781 --> 00:31:57,580
culture center, but then it
ends up backfiring. Um, and
it's a sort of the worst.

504
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:01,030
I mean unfortunately there
were more examples of that
and they are good examples.

505
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:06,750
Probably the most ubiquitous might've
been gov is a Pepsi to a cultural moment

506
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,630
and make it about people
to made about that.

507
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,530
And it turned to a meme that
was piled on their base. Right.

508
00:32:14,531 --> 00:32:18,280
And then really the issue there is
that they'll keep playing Pepsi.

509
00:32:18,281 --> 00:32:22,540
They weren't dog who is smart people.
Nda is from grade schools, right?

510
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,320
Smart people. It wasn't, they were
dominant as completely oblivious.

511
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:30,370
They just more closer to the culture.
They didn't understand the shared beliefs,

512
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:34,420
the artifacts, the social norms, the
unwritten rules, the legs that they use.

513
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:39,230
And it's the lack of understanding of
the nuances that gets you off step.

514
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:42,440
You don't understand the nuances,
that's when you play yourself.

515
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:45,230
So the idea is to stay very, very, very,

516
00:32:45,231 --> 00:32:48,980
very close to the culture and all
times requires from being a part of the

517
00:32:48,981 --> 00:32:51,240
culture as opposed to being a tourist.
Right.

518
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,930
That the day we used to call
it ethnographic studies, right.

519
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,370
But getting away way in.

520
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:56,973
Yep.

521
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:57,671
Marcus,

522
00:32:57,671 --> 00:33:01,860
I think I saw an example like a week ago
of something you're talking about with

523
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:02,703
blood disease.

524
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:07,270
You see the tweet that when he set out
to where they were kind of dogging the

525
00:33:07,271 --> 00:33:11,730
Nebraska coaches name is frost.
Um, and they said you have frosty,

526
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:15,190
which gives meeting white 40 nothing at
halftime and they put out a tweet during

527
00:33:15,191 --> 00:33:20,170
half time and I'm Mexican.
You know what's going viral?

528
00:33:20,171 --> 00:33:24,970
I see it on the national news,
I see it on ESPN, you know, um,

529
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:28,810
it's a good brass offense. We're not happy
because they said, hey, you know, we,

530
00:33:28,811 --> 00:33:29,081
you know,

531
00:33:29,081 --> 00:33:33,730
when these two and then Wendy's on
their official like Twitter handle said,

532
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:37,690
we're pretty sure that, you know,
the grass is, have a sense of humor.

533
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:39,850
Some of them were still on
the, and they said, well,

534
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:44,320
we based our period geodesic partners.
Yes, it was crazy. Again, wow,

535
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:45,910
we've got to talking about their food,

536
00:33:45,911 --> 00:33:48,040
but then all of a sudden
a lot of people are going,

537
00:33:48,041 --> 00:33:49,060
I'm going to go eat at Wendy's.

538
00:33:49,061 --> 00:33:53,470
I just love that they got the courage
to kind of get out there and caused some

539
00:33:53,471 --> 00:33:57,310
trouble. Think I winkies without
being very, very close to a business.

540
00:33:57,311 --> 00:34:01,000
I think Wendy's bigger or number three,
and this makes,

541
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:05,890
why not throw some shots and their
entire strategy at this point pretty much

542
00:34:05,891 --> 00:34:10,810
about the trolling everybody else.
We've got 12 and you don't get hurt.

543
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:15,190
Come on. [inaudible] at all.
And considering this is a
part of their needles now,

544
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:18,240
people don't make less
urine from the basket. Uh,

545
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:22,150
people have had pretty big skin becomes
that sort of thing, but they are,

546
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:25,150
they're hugging all the right nuance
of the culture they're part of.

547
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,550
And we see things getting shader,

548
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:30,460
we're going viral because people who
believe the same thing that Wendy's does,

549
00:34:30,461 --> 00:34:34,990
their take on things people share
also, right? It's all about community.

550
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:37,900
Community is another way of talking about
the cultures that were a part of it.

551
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:43,620
You see a lot of um,
how you around like Youtube,

552
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:46,060
collaboration's Instagram collaborations,

553
00:34:46,061 --> 00:34:49,270
these kinds of integrations
that brands are trying to do.

554
00:34:49,271 --> 00:34:53,710
I'd be curious to hear your thoughts
on on that and whether that's actually

555
00:34:53,711 --> 00:34:54,400
getting close to them

556
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,650
culture or if it's sort of counter so,

557
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:01,260
and so I like as far as like taking
advantage of a platform to do things

558
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:05,560
right or, or more like the collaborations
with the creators on those platforms.

559
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,760
So, so I, I'd say this, my
thinking about the technology,

560
00:35:08,761 --> 00:35:11,550
the technology and the
Zeros and ones if you will,

561
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:16,440
the Zeros and ones are the
facilitators of networks, right?

562
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:20,550
Things that normally be disparate are
now connected things to day to day.

563
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:23,460
That that goes from one node to the next.
Um,

564
00:35:23,461 --> 00:35:25,890
so same sort of thing.

565
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,600
And what we find when we extrapolate that,

566
00:35:28,601 --> 00:35:30,300
and I want to talk about
the network of things,

567
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:31,740
that network of people and things,

568
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:36,000
what some of the network of people
and people and things like Instagram,

569
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,420
Facebook,

570
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:40,760
social networking platforms are connecting
people who see the world similarly,

571
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,190
we're all my affiliate and we connected.
That is they share the same beliefs.

572
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:46,530
Social norms,
break written rules and rituals.

573
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:51,480
So think when brands partner with black
forms technologies who understand the

574
00:35:51,481 --> 00:35:54,690
dynamics of the network, the
dynamics of the culture, they,

575
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,700
they borrowed approximately,
right? They borrow.

576
00:35:57,701 --> 00:36:01,080
The people know the culture better than
Nate too, to get them closer to it.

577
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,730
That's massively powerful.

578
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:06,390
The idea though is that it's always
going to be an outsource skills as I have

579
00:36:06,391 --> 00:36:08,400
the capability of the brand,
right?

580
00:36:08,401 --> 00:36:11,970
Capabilities about repeatability and
reliability. Not to outsource that,

581
00:36:11,971 --> 00:36:13,140
that I really don't have it,

582
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,970
which is good because they get a chance
a couple of at bats to do something

583
00:36:17,971 --> 00:36:18,804
powerful.

584
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:22,590
But it's a challenge for them because
it's not really inside the eagles were the

585
00:36:22,591 --> 00:36:23,424
brand is all about.

586
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,333
Sure.

587
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:28,440
So if you're not a part of the culture
that you're trying to get close to and

588
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:31,650
you can run ethnography,
ethnographic studies. Yeah,

589
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:35,530
either tools they're available to us.
I mean,

590
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:37,250
I'm actually thinking of an advertiser,

591
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:40,960
a group that I work with
as aftermarket auto,

592
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:45,310
so it's exact opposite gender,
different age range,

593
00:36:45,311 --> 00:36:46,840
different lifestyle entirely,

594
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:51,010
but I want to get to know that a little
bit worried Smidley so it's good ideas

595
00:36:51,011 --> 00:36:52,300
for tools we can tap into.

596
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:53,880
Well,
I know one is called Google

597
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:00,390
did, which is why it's so important to
understand the evolving media landscape,

598
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:05,700
social listening, search
behavior, viewership behavior.

599
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:10,640
We get a sense it's a proxy to what people
do, what they believe, where they go.

600
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:13,350
They talk about what they believe.
We know what they were.

601
00:37:13,351 --> 00:37:15,330
We don't artifacts like dogs,
any pictures of them.

602
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:19,190
These things provide a proxy that we
normally would have to go move with the

603
00:37:19,191 --> 00:37:21,060
coal miners,
Noah coal miners do.

604
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:26,040
Instead we can see them from a
distance and a short sort of bursts.

605
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:30,250
Well a large representation of the
population that we can pull a sample world

606
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:32,980
stage. I'll say this is
the real thing. Right?

607
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:37,010
And it's not really defined by demography
is that defined by psychographics

608
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:41,370
either is defined by the beliefs that
we hold, the behaviors we strive to,

609
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:45,600
the language that we use in tech,
like search, like social listening.

610
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:49,590
Those needs provide a bird's eye view
as be normally wouldn't have access to

611
00:37:49,591 --> 00:37:50,940
without a ton of resources.

612
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:56,240
And I realized like my ex caliber of
sorts is Google trends it crimson hexagon,

613
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,750
I use it for everything to
bet on people. Right. I can't,

614
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,810
I have clients across a wide spectrum.

615
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:06,330
Google after different culture
have different networks.

616
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:10,770
So it requires me to be able
to cold switch between them
and I can't do all that.

617
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,870
Right.
I can't be that close to all of them.

618
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,300
So I can either use people work with it.

619
00:38:15,301 --> 00:38:19,010
They work the agency who are close to
the culture while you use some proxy via

620
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:19,873
the tech ops

621
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:24,470
with the social listening tools. Sorry, I
assume those are like paid subscription.

622
00:38:24,471 --> 00:38:26,630
So I'm more thinking, you know, we,

623
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:30,330
we know the wealth of Google tools
that we have at our disposal are there,

624
00:38:30,331 --> 00:38:34,140
are there free social norms? Dooley's
Twitter advanced search. Okay, cool.

625
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:38,460
Super free. Like it's not as
robust as using premise it or uh,

626
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:41,440
or hootsuite or something like that.
But it's free.

627
00:38:41,441 --> 00:38:44,170
It gives you a nice down and
dirty look at what's going on.

628
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:48,770
Super Representative of a sample
of people. Absolutely. Yeah.

629
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:50,420
My question is,
you know,

630
00:38:50,421 --> 00:38:53,620
like I know we'll have seen like the
Nike just do it campaign for example.

631
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:58,270
And so I guess my question is like when
making a decision to launch a campaign

632
00:38:58,271 --> 00:39:01,990
like that, when it might be considered
well and that might be considered,

633
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:06,020
some would consider it to be,
um, you know, culturally, um,

634
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:08,740
polarize this or how do
you, how do you go, what,

635
00:39:08,741 --> 00:39:13,120
how does a company make what decision
making built into that? So I get that,

636
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:17,410
well, it's got to conviction. What do you
believe, right. Simon Sinek would say,

637
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,130
why have you exists? People don't buy what
you do. They buy why you do it. Right.

638
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,420
What do you believe?

639
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:26,650
And I think the biggest opportunity for
brands aren't attacking to networks who

640
00:39:26,651 --> 00:39:29,890
share the same belief as the brand
because those are the brands we use to

641
00:39:29,891 --> 00:39:33,010
communicate. This is who I am,
this is how I see the world. Right?

642
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:38,040
And conviction by its very essence
requires saying no to things.

643
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:42,400
It required two and think that may be
dismissive to people grown into the

644
00:39:42,401 --> 00:39:44,710
world's way. You do. And the
fact that night she was like, no,

645
00:39:44,711 --> 00:39:47,830
we're standing with copper nick,
because he aligns to our belief system.

646
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,410
And if you don't rock with that,
then you don't rock with us.

647
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,440
And also people were burning
their Nike's and say,

648
00:39:52,441 --> 00:39:55,000
I'm never going to buy another pair
of Nike's. You're going to die.

649
00:39:55,001 --> 00:40:00,001
Nike or your company sucks for the
people who believe when Nike believes in

650
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:05,500
Stanley copy as well, what they say,
getting two pair, right? I want more.

651
00:40:05,501 --> 00:40:09,940
I'm a buy more because this theme is
representation of our belief. So you know,

652
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:14,560
it's difficult. It's,
it's, it is a simple idea,

653
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:19,660
but it's not easy.
And we often confuse simplicity and ease,

654
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:23,080
right? Like losing weight. This is
a simple idea. Don't eat so much,

655
00:40:23,081 --> 00:40:25,020
move more personably.

656
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,330
Anthony's right in.

657
00:40:28,331 --> 00:40:31,660
The same thing goes with convictions for
brands like what do you really believe?

658
00:40:31,661 --> 00:40:32,680
If you believe that,

659
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,820
we will stand up for that when
everyone else is sitting down,

660
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:37,270
when everyone else is,
it gets you where you stand up for it.

661
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:41,910
That is what conviction is all about
and the branch who have very clear as

662
00:40:41,911 --> 00:40:44,950
salient convictions. Now, little do
people know what they believe in.

663
00:40:44,951 --> 00:40:48,400
Therefore they use those brands but
all their actions or communication,

664
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:52,420
people that they hire,
those people come towards the brand.

665
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,400
I mean that's the idea.

666
00:40:54,401 --> 00:40:57,310
That branch should have conviction on
just where they communicate but also

667
00:40:57,311 --> 00:41:00,580
within the organization so that people
who are part of the organization,

668
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:04,630
they believe and they to preach the
Gospel and they to our democracy

669
00:41:04,631 --> 00:41:08,220
representations of the brand's conviction,
et Cetera,

670
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,800
did.
This is about the nuances of the culture.

671
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:21,980
Like it's a hard one to say.
Um,

672
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,220
we pay mind to the nuances.

673
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:27,430
We feel like it's a real thing
if people know the nuances.

674
00:41:27,431 --> 00:41:29,140
When someone is saying
there's appropriate like no,

675
00:41:29,141 --> 00:41:32,290
you don't understand because the
brain has always been a part of this.

676
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:34,270
Here are all the Demassio representations,

677
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,860
the evidence that shows this
brand's always been this way.

678
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,470
So then doing this is not a,
is that the new,

679
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:43,430
this is writing a lot of people always
been about, but you got to be about it.

680
00:41:43,431 --> 00:41:46,940
Like what did he say? Don't talk about
it. Be about it. Right. The same thing.

681
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:52,660
Okay. Um, so I'm really big
on like influencer marketing.

682
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:57,430
So like I know in the past sophomore
year with, we don't say, um, job to her,

683
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:02,260
um, little media formation
and she mentioned red
lobster and like, after that,

684
00:42:02,261 --> 00:42:06,040
like sales increased like people are
going to relapse to. And then like,

685
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:09,520
just like last week, Kylie
Jenner, she put on her snapchat,

686
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:10,970
she had milk for the first time

687
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:19,240
in her milk, just like posted
and like all these things.

688
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,070
So my question is,
is like,

689
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:25,720
should companies or brands like continue
to ride that wave and like use that

690
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:29,110
celebrity or influenced her
to, um, promote their brands,

691
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:33,160
like chat to tap into other influencer,
other culture?

692
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:37,310
I'll start this and I'll answer your
question with a step back and then we'll

693
00:42:37,311 --> 00:42:41,840
step into it. Is there first, it's like
unpacking this idea of influencers, right?

694
00:42:41,841 --> 00:42:44,210
So we think of like the Kylie Jenner's,

695
00:42:44,211 --> 00:42:48,710
the Beyonce is the Kanye is the broadest
influencers and they have influence,

696
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,910
but the lecturer described their influence
as ideological influence. That is,

697
00:42:52,911 --> 00:42:57,050
we look up that we aspire to that,
but we don't compare ourselves to it.

698
00:42:57,430 --> 00:43:02,090
Like we don't hear Connie likes
talking about where it has been. We,

699
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:05,310
and then we get our Toyota
like, I suck at life, takes all,

700
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:07,790
he has the most money in the guard,
paint our paycheck or I hate myself.

701
00:43:07,791 --> 00:43:10,460
You don't do that. We compare
ourselves to people who are like us,

702
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,940
people who were part of the same network
that we're part of our peers. Um,

703
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:17,810
so when I think about
influencers at that level,

704
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:22,700
like they're basically contextualized
medium, they're bright wattage media,

705
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:28,250
but those aren't, but they're, their
media isn't what makes behavior stick.

706
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:30,890
It's your people which
makes behavior stick.

707
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:34,460
One would say that culture moves forward.
The basis of, one simple question,

708
00:43:34,461 --> 00:43:37,550
do people like me do something like
this? The answer is yes, I do it.

709
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:40,670
The answer is no, I don't. It would
make a decision hundreds of times a day.

710
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:42,680
People like me do something like this,

711
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:45,800
so say I see Jay z where a
super cool hat and I'm like,

712
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:49,320
that's dope ass shoes a match it
I'm buying that happened, right?

713
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:53,420
I go by the hat and I go to lunch with
my friends and I sit at lunch and they're

714
00:43:53,421 --> 00:43:56,540
like, what are you wearing? Like
you're like, you're like an idiot.

715
00:43:56,541 --> 00:43:59,460
Take that hat off. What am I going
to do? I'll take that hat off.

716
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:02,720
Put it in the closet has never
seen the light of day. Right?

717
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:07,460
Our people are what makes the things
stick because our people are the people

718
00:44:07,461 --> 00:44:09,920
that we want to be connected to.
As Aristotle was saying,

719
00:44:09,921 --> 00:44:11,330
we're social animals by nature.

720
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,930
So do everything we can to connect
people who are just like us.

721
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:19,130
They scratch the same beliefs,
say social norms, same old rules,

722
00:44:19,131 --> 00:44:20,930
and they use the same language,
right?

723
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:25,280
So I think about how we leverage
influence in this way. Well,

724
00:44:25,281 --> 00:44:28,730
we leverage the media that they
provide for sure. Right? Well,

725
00:44:28,731 --> 00:44:31,440
we have to make sure that there
is some concurrence that is,

726
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:35,490
there's a lot of visibility that
people like me doing that thing, right?

727
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:40,390
Like Beyonce says he does any good
I take is to red lobster, right?

728
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:43,080
And it wasn't a bit like
meeting to the girls, all,

729
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:46,440
you better take me to red lobster,
right? People like me do this.

730
00:44:46,441 --> 00:44:48,770
And then I'm like, yeah, I'm gonna
do this as well. And it'd be,

731
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,470
it creates the cultural weight that
allows us to propagate across the network.

732
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:55,800
So the answer, the short
answer is yes, absolutely.

733
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:58,880
As long as it aligns to what
the brand's is all about. Well,

734
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:02,730
what's the most important is how do we
get it to propagate across the social web

735
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:05,070
to these networks of people,
these communities.

736
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:09,630
So that the behavior stick is difference
between like going viral and be

737
00:45:09,631 --> 00:45:13,980
culturally contains the names just spread
person to person, kind of Peter out.

738
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:16,410
But it spreads from person to person.
It takes hold culture,

739
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:19,740
unpacking our beliefs,
behaviors, artifacts, language,

740
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:23,230
which was doing my doctoral
research. Thank you. Yeah.

741
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:26,850
Good. Some very respected
brands. So I'm curious, um,

742
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:31,110
what is your main criteria before he
decided to say yes or no to a client or a

743
00:45:31,111 --> 00:45:31,944
project?

744
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:32,670
Uh,

745
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:37,670
so I don't make the calls on the scope
of work that the agency says is deemable,

746
00:45:39,091 --> 00:45:40,780
but for me to work on the products there,

747
00:45:40,781 --> 00:45:43,160
there's things that come into the
building that my teammates have.

748
00:45:43,161 --> 00:45:46,800
Sky You don't touch. Um, and unfortunately
I'm, I'm going to place my career.

749
00:45:46,801 --> 00:45:49,690
I can say no, not another festival
statements. Um, I tried to take it,

750
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:53,640
we'll see a wave. I don't
do the tobacco at all. Um,

751
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:58,290
and I try to stay away from alcohol
particularly because I'm consuming. Right.

752
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:02,020
And you know, I've worked with me,
I work was one of our clients. Um,

753
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:04,770
just the building. While
there may be some, uh,

754
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:08,910
somebody have issue with
Mcdonald's. I don't. Right. Um,

755
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:13,200
but if it has request for years,
for four years,

756
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:15,870
and I've never tasted the product at all,
right?

757
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:19,110
At that time I couldn't say dope bro.
Once my broker and say no today,

758
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:20,220
I'd say no thank you.

759
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:23,170
Just because this describes it
does it in a line to my beliefs.

760
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:26,630
There's a line to what
I like to do and me,

761
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:30,040
it'd be hard for me to sleep at night
telling people to consume more, some more,

762
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:33,360
some more tobacco completely against,
and therefore,

763
00:46:33,361 --> 00:46:36,990
I won't even tell us this
stuff. But again, it's just the,

764
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,330
I had a question about what you've done,

765
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,170
who you've been apart of
brands or they're going to be,

766
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:42,930
the competitor has totally crushed it.

767
00:46:42,931 --> 00:46:47,220
Like you're working Miller and QVR
sales are completely skyrocketing.

768
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:48,990
The move usually till it,

769
00:46:48,991 --> 00:46:52,860
right on their success or take
the complete opposite stance.

770
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:56,030
I think it depends on where the brand is.

771
00:46:56,660 --> 00:47:01,660
So if you're the market leader and
these guys are skyrocketing up,

772
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,930
you don't want to put the spotlight
on those guys. In most cases.

773
00:47:05,931 --> 00:47:09,560
It's kind of like that's
the, uh, that will be,

774
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:12,530
that's the conventional wisdom.
I think about it.

775
00:47:12,531 --> 00:47:16,460
Like are we Drake and push it to you?
We're beefing out this summer, right?

776
00:47:16,461 --> 00:47:20,780
Drink is like here, Pusha t is not as
high as far as the claim. Right? Um,

777
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:22,640
who's t throws jabs at Drake,

778
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:25,310
Drake response can push it
to use rubber sales go up.

779
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
So all times will be the market leader.
Your job is just to say that the,

780
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:32,110
if your job is to grow the
market rolling category,

781
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:34,630
someone throw shots at you
or someone's rising up,

782
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:37,960
just make sure that you keep the category
growing until they become too close to

783
00:47:37,961 --> 00:47:38,794
call.

784
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:43,270
In those cases you find ways to the
door of that sometimes acquisition.

785
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:46,600
Um, and then sometimes it's
finding ways to to blot.

786
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:51,150
Have you been a part of the branch
strategy that has successfully combat at a

787
00:47:51,151 --> 00:47:52,430
major spike in a competitor?

788
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:56,320
Um, I would say so. State
farm, right? So state farm,

789
00:47:57,310 --> 00:47:59,290
they are the market leader by far.

790
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:04,660
But you see a lot of market share being
acquired by particularly the Geicos in

791
00:48:04,661 --> 00:48:08,360
the world insurance progressive.
All state. So state farm,

792
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:12,790
like how do you keep the category growing,
which the category is sort of,

793
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:17,740
um, if it's sort of self
moving because it's obligatory.

794
00:48:17,741 --> 00:48:20,740
If you want to drive this country,
you need all of these rooms, right?

795
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,440
But how many people to get
on as soon to get it with us,

796
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:27,550
get a financial services and kid with
us while these other guys are coming to

797
00:48:27,551 --> 00:48:28,031
the market.

798
00:48:28,031 --> 00:48:33,031
So we found ways to use
culture to continue to boost
the brand and broaden the

799
00:48:33,131 --> 00:48:34,900
aperture of the category.

800
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:38,400
Particularly during the clip Paul
Campaign for state bar. Right?

801
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:41,160
So instead of talking about
how we're barely in state hub,

802
00:48:41,161 --> 00:48:42,760
we're better than Geico.

803
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:46,090
We just talked about how great the
state farm is that helping you with the

804
00:48:46,091 --> 00:48:50,800
magical age and like the neighbor state
farm, is there a shows up or personify?

805
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:54,850
What happens when you have
an agent? What's the only
clip, Paul? Right. Chris Ball.

806
00:48:54,851 --> 00:48:55,870
All Star,
state farm.

807
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:59,710
All of our all star point guard
who throws assist on the court,

808
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:02,650
Flip Paul All star state farm agent.
There was a system, real life,

809
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:07,750
all these things to manifest. What the
brand is all about so that we can grow,

810
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:10,160
grow as presence. Thank you. Got It.

811
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:15,960
So I'm kind of interested in
the brainstorming and then
zeroing in on what we're

812
00:49:15,961 --> 00:49:18,550
going to do process.
Uh,

813
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:23,400
the example of Potbelly's she just talked
about and um, you're gathering data,

814
00:49:23,401 --> 00:49:25,670
you're trying to understand what
the brand really wants to go to.

815
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:29,460
We're not just like sandwiches
but happiness. What does
brainstorming look like?

816
00:49:29,461 --> 00:49:31,940
And then how do you say, okay,
this is what we're going to go for.

817
00:49:31,941 --> 00:49:33,560
It cause going to watch a commercial.
I'm like,

818
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,830
I can't imagine someone in
the room being like, Hey,

819
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:36,770
this is what we're going to go.

820
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:41,130
I'm just wondering what it looks like to
brainstorm and then make that decision

821
00:49:41,131 --> 00:49:42,550
on kids is what we're
going to move forward.

822
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:47,510
Radical simplicity. Just get
radical, radical, radical simplicity.

823
00:49:47,511 --> 00:49:50,630
So brokers ask is brings is
what do we believe as a brain?

824
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,750
How do we see the world in the world
of I'm only behave in the world.

825
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:57,980
So what do we believe?
And once we realize what the why is,

826
00:49:57,981 --> 00:50:00,740
what the conviction of the brand is,
now we know who we're targeting.

827
00:50:00,741 --> 00:50:02,510
People who see the world way we do,
right?

828
00:50:02,511 --> 00:50:06,020
So now we know who we are and how they're
going after work or who we went after.

829
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:08,840
The next question is what
do we want them to do?

830
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:13,930
Cause Marketing's one of those words
that we use, uh, full of jargon.

831
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:15,930
Distractions, buzzwords,
right? Like, well,

832
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,350
it's marketing asked 10 people
get 20 different answers.

833
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:23,300
So I think about marketing as radically
splits in simplistic as possible. Uh,

834
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:27,050
old Oxford dictionary defines marketing
is going to market like parking is going

835
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:28,370
market the market.

836
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:32,870
Being people with the core of
marketing get people to adopt behavior.

837
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:36,920
So we know what we're all about as a
brand. We know who we're going after.

838
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:40,490
Now the question is what do we want
people to do? And all the messages,

839
00:50:40,491 --> 00:50:44,600
communications, campaigns,
uh, products, activations,

840
00:50:44,601 --> 00:50:49,340
they're all designed to get people
to move as simple as possible.

841
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:52,400
All the other things that we built on
and the implications and what not we can

842
00:50:52,401 --> 00:50:55,910
get into. But it all starts with
who are we? Who are we going after?

843
00:50:55,911 --> 00:51:00,110
What behavior within the table?
My pleasure. Thanks so much.

844
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:05,160
[inaudible].
