00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,630
Hi everybody. Welcome to Google
talks. Today's a very special day.

2
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:14,800
I want to introduce a great friend of
mine and somebody that I really look up to

3
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,650
in the tech space.
His name is Ardell Millhouse.

4
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:22,660
What makes him unique and very special
is he has led many hackathons in Rhode

5
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,410
Island, has been recognized by President
Obama and Congress, men and women.

6
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:27,723
Aside from that,

7
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,720
the beautiful thing is that he's helped
today lead many underprivileged and

8
00:00:31,721 --> 00:00:35,800
underserved markets for people that
are interested in becoming engineers.

9
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,300
Aside from that,

10
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:42,640
he's constantly challenging the status
quo and always making sure that many

11
00:00:42,641 --> 00:00:47,200
people are involved and challenged
every day in a very technological,

12
00:00:47,201 --> 00:00:48,190
digital age.

13
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:52,480
I'd love to welcome my dearest friend
and a leader in Tech and a serial

14
00:00:52,481 --> 00:00:56,680
entrepreneur are not mail house
course.

15
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,390
Thank you, Miranda. Thanks for having me.

16
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,530
It's been great to be here.
All right,

17
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:10,220
so good enough to noon everyone again.
My name is RNL Millhouse and

18
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,690
it's an interesting story and an
incident interesting journey that we're

19
00:01:14,691 --> 00:01:19,691
embarking upon and today we're going
to be talking about rebooting emerging

20
00:01:19,761 --> 00:01:20,930
domestic markets.

21
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,560
This concept was first spoken about about
three or four decades ago by a Harvard

22
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:32,230
University professor who talked about
taking urban centers and the ticking the

23
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:37,370
underserved workers in those communities,
training them,

24
00:01:37,371 --> 00:01:41,630
give them the right technical skills
or labor skills that they needed to

25
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:46,640
integrate into society here in America
wrote a really great book about it,

26
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:52,090
but the concept never really took off and
throughout my life as I grew up in the

27
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,850
story that I'm about to share,

28
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,550
I always thought about how can
we really make this happen?

29
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:01,880
How can we take it from the page in print
or on the stage as they often say in

30
00:02:01,881 --> 00:02:04,040
Broadway,
right from the page to the stage,

31
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:09,290
and I'm even writing a book about it,
rebooting emerging domestic markets,

32
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:14,000
rearchitecting the middleclass
innovation process in America, and

33
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:18,980
I'm an entrepreneur,
a software developer,

34
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,230
but I really think of myself
as a social change agent,

35
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,170
someone who is trying to
bring about change and impact.

36
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,920
Steve Jobs talked about of all the
things that he wanted to do in his life,

37
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,220
he simply wanted to make
a dent in the universe.

38
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,800
And it wasn't about the money,

39
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,920
it wasn't about the
creations or the accolades,

40
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,230
it was about making a significant change.

41
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,680
And so I created a company
called Intercity geeks
along with a couple of other

42
00:02:45,681 --> 00:02:46,070
gentlemen.

43
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:51,070
I'll be introducing them by name and
another organization called career devs

44
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,300
interested in Geeks.

45
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:58,300
Our goal is to simply fuel computer
science education and to drive innovation

46
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:04,450
driven entrepreneurship
throughout American cities
in both underserved and under

47
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:09,451
skilled markets are our main goal is
to impact 1 million plus people in our

48
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:11,314
pipeline.

49
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,780
The other is called career
devs and career dabs.

50
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:21,781
This launching rigorous computer science
academies along with Innovation Driven

51
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,510
Entrepreneurial incubators.
So while interested,

52
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:28,990
he geeks is the nonprofit arm career.
DEB's is the for profit arm.

53
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,800
How all this stuff comes together.

54
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,430
You really need to take a deep dive into
my story and it's a really interesting

55
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:40,750
story. I believe it starts off back in
Boston, Massachusetts, where I was born.

56
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,740
I was born to a single mother,

57
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:49,600
Dorothy Lee Millhouse and single mom,

58
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:54,630
which is really the prototypical urban
story that you hear for people of Color.

59
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,330
Right.
And my mother had four children.

60
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:03,760
Which one is me? Can you guys
guess? That's me right there.

61
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,920
Second oldest.

62
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:11,980
And what was interesting in Boston that
we went from a middle class neighborhood.

63
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,180
My mother ended up getting sick.

64
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:16,850
We moved from the middle
class neighborhood to a lower
income neighborhood APP.

65
00:04:16,851 --> 00:04:19,840
She,
after she took ill and

66
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:21,690
yeah,

67
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:25,290
wild Roxbury, which was a neighbor
that we moved to, was very, very tough.

68
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:28,560
There was gunfire,
drug needles.

69
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,810
I've had guns held to my head coming from
a school where people robbing me from

70
00:04:32,811 --> 00:04:35,550
money, I would get home. My
mother was like, oh, how was
your day, honey? Let me go.

71
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,380
Was fine. So a couple of
things were interesting. One,

72
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,590
we didn't know that we were
poor and we didn't know that.

73
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:48,000
I didn't know that we should be unhappy.
We were happy. We had a nice family. And,

74
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:52,260
but one day my mother, when
we were on welfare, food
stamps, section eight housing,

75
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,130
she took her housing certificate to the
housing authorities and said she wanted

76
00:04:56,131 --> 00:05:00,630
to move and they were asking her,
where do you want to move?

77
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:06,480
And she mentioned that she wanted
to move to Cape Cod. Right.

78
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:12,110
And it wasn't until we actually
moved to Cape Cod that I notice this,

79
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,470
that the urban lifestyle formula,
we had been living,

80
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,180
that there was a vicious perpetuating
cycle that repeats itself.

81
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,910
So in eighth grade we packed up,
we moved to Cape Cod,

82
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:31,230
and it was, you know, people go,

83
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,720
this is the place that people travel
to for, for, for vacations, right?

84
00:05:33,721 --> 00:05:38,340
From all around the world.
And I'm living there 365 days a year.

85
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,070
But I noticed another cycle,

86
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,910
a virtuous perpetuating cycle,

87
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,970
which was the opposite of what
was taking place in Boston.

88
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,140
And for the first time in my life,

89
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,510
something changed
my worldview

90
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:03,950
because
living in Boston and Cape Cod,

91
00:06:03,951 --> 00:06:07,040
the dichotomy was incredibly different.

92
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,141
On the Cape,

93
00:06:09,141 --> 00:06:13,850
I was taking courses such as Latin
or I learned one of my favorite jokes

94
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,440
[inaudible] suburby
where are your underwear?

95
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:23,240
We even had our, you know, a wrap
for Latin. Latin is a dead language.

96
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:28,190
It's dead as it can be. First it killed
the Romans and now it's killing me, right?

97
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,910
But Magnar chrome,
Cherry Tati Pula of vigor.

98
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,530
[inaudible] and so I'm learning
all these different things.

99
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,840
And when we moved to the Cape,

100
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:41,780
we didn't live in tenement buildings
that you found in the city.

101
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:45,200
We live right up the seventh hole
or the dentist pines golf course.

102
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,950
And I remember waking up one morning,

103
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:51,830
I saw these little white balls
in my yard and I said, mom,

104
00:06:51,831 --> 00:06:53,570
why are these balls keep
coming into our yard?

105
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,150
And what are those people out there
doing? What are they, why do they,

106
00:06:56,151 --> 00:06:59,930
are they farming? It looks like
they're trying to farm. What do they,

107
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:03,380
what are they planting? I couldn't
understand this. He says, no, honey,

108
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:07,280
they're playing golf. I
said, wow, what does golf and

109
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,850
I've learned about Camelot, the
Kennedys, they live 10 minutes from me.

110
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,580
The Kennedy compound, John F. Kennedy,
his family, everyone all right there,

111
00:07:19,581 --> 00:07:22,090
their lineage.
So I heard the stories.

112
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:27,050
I was regaled with all of the tales of
their fame and their wealth and it was

113
00:07:27,051 --> 00:07:30,470
just a different perspective of
learning about a former president,

114
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,450
but their family lives down the street.

115
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,410
This is the next stage
was kind of interesting.

116
00:07:38,411 --> 00:07:42,550
My first job in high school took place
at a place called Fred's Turkey house.

117
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:49,280
Now this is really impactful because while
I was, I started off as a dishwasher,

118
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:53,260
then a prep cook, then a line cook,
then a shelf, but at this restaurant,

119
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,750
the person that owned
his name was Fred Bloom,

120
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,600
one of my greatest mentors
and influencers in my life.

121
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,990
He had about four or five restaurants on
the Cape and there was a gentleman that

122
00:08:01,991 --> 00:08:06,280
went to Harvard University that graduated
in computer science who worked for him

123
00:08:06,281 --> 00:08:08,470
running all of the communications.
Jeff rule.

124
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:12,370
He was talking about trying
to learn me to the dark side,

125
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:16,330
which is computer science because aren't
alley cause you don't want to be a

126
00:08:16,331 --> 00:08:19,480
laborer sweating away in a kitchen
all your life. He goes, listen,

127
00:08:19,481 --> 00:08:22,420
you know you love playing around with
computers and making these video games in

128
00:08:22,421 --> 00:08:26,320
school. Stick with that. And so I said,
oh no. But then Fred said, hey listen,

129
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:30,070
go to Johnson Wales University.
Come back here and manage my restaurants.

130
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,070
So there was a light side and
the dark side tempting me.

131
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,230
Then in high school I took my
first computer program in class.

132
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:44,060
Pascal fell in love myself
and several of the students.

133
00:08:44,061 --> 00:08:45,380
We were always getting in trouble,

134
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:49,700
doing things with code that you shouldn't
be doing and then I got a job working

135
00:08:49,701 --> 00:08:54,110
for my high school making $12 an
hour as a junior. I was hooked.

136
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:58,050
I was making more than I was making in
the restaurant business and it was just

137
00:08:58,051 --> 00:08:58,884
phenomenal.

138
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,480
Something else interesting
that that happened on the
Cape was one of my teachers

139
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,660
was asking where I lived in Boston.
I said, oh I remember living.

140
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:10,200
We once lived on mass ave
Massachusetts avenue and she said, Oh,

141
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,620
you were right down the street
from MIT. I said, am I, what

142
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,990
am I who? She goes, no,
Mit Ivy League university.

143
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,660
Never heard of it.
She goes,

144
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:24,900
it was less than a
quarter mile from me and

145
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:31,550
that really bothered me that
MIT and Harvard were so close,

146
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,940
but they might as well be. They might as
well have been miles away, planets away,

147
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,290
different universe really

148
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,460
going to school on the Cape. Students
would pull up in the school and BMWs,

149
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:49,680
Mercedes or just brand new cars,
brand new Toyotas.

150
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,680
When our car, even though we lived
on the Cape, it was still a, uh,

151
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,500
we were still poor. We were using a
housing certificate to live on Cape Cod,

152
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:02,040
so sometimes dropping us off to school.

153
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:06,510
We had this station wagon that had Mitch
match wheels smoke coming out of the

154
00:10:06,511 --> 00:10:09,120
back of it and so I would beg my
mother like, mom, can you please just,

155
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:11,730
can you drop me off down
the street because honey,

156
00:10:11,731 --> 00:10:13,200
but it's still like a quarter mile walk.
I was like,

157
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:16,380
I was just embarrassed to pull
up in the school in that car.

158
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,073
Okay.

159
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,230
What was happening was that I
was experiencing culture shock.

160
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:32,210
I was seriously undergoing a sense
of disorientation in disbelief

161
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,870
about what I was seeing.
My middle school,

162
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,940
the cafeteria was more
reminiscent of what you have here

163
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,440
in Boston.
We didn't have the cafeteria.

164
00:10:46,441 --> 00:10:50,580
It was everything was make shift
and the food wasn't that great.

165
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:56,610
Periodically we would travel back and
forth to Boston and I began to see this

166
00:10:56,611 --> 00:11:01,611
divergence between my cousins
lives in my friends' lives,

167
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:07,590
my friends and their parents on the
Cape versus they're my friends and their

168
00:11:07,591 --> 00:11:09,780
parents in Boston.
As I was in Boston,

169
00:11:09,781 --> 00:11:13,470
I would notice that the adults were
talking about how hard things were,

170
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:19,080
that there were no opportunities. They
just lost a job. They couldn't get ahead.

171
00:11:19,081 --> 00:11:22,980
They, their electricity was being
turned off. This week on the Cape,

172
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,770
everything was happy and
everyone was doing fine.

173
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:30,470
And as we would go back and forth, it
was lights on, lights off, lights on,

174
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,860
life lights off.
And it was disconcerting.

175
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:40,440
And I didn't know, I said in Boston
and Cape Cod, 60 miles apart.

176
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:46,860
So it really, really, really
troubling back and forth. Cape Cod,

177
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,440
Boston,
Cape Cod to Boston.

178
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:59,490
And I remember the exact moment
that this thing happened.

179
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,980
I woke up one morning and I realized
that I had two worldviews because of my

180
00:12:04,981 --> 00:12:08,060
friends in Boston. They all, and
myself included, when I moved,

181
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,860
initially moved to Cape Cod,
I wanted to be a rapper,

182
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,570
basketball player or some
type of athlete or entertainer

183
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,890
where everyone in the Kate was talking
about where we going to school,

184
00:12:19,891 --> 00:12:21,330
what we're going to do without careers.

185
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:26,730
And so hearing two different worlds,

186
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,020
two different worldviews.

187
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:32,250
And I saw that one worldview was just
crumbling and the other was thriving.

188
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:36,900
So I left high school and I went to
college at Johnson Wales University,

189
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,820
computer science,
my,

190
00:12:38,821 --> 00:12:42,780
like my buddy cliff and at Johnson Wales,

191
00:12:42,781 --> 00:12:43,830
things really took off.

192
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:47,430
I was a computer lab assistant and
that's what I've learned about.

193
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,660
I learned about innovation.

194
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:53,310
I started taking some of the processes
that they had in place that took four or

195
00:12:53,311 --> 00:12:56,940
five days to change the computers over
at the end of each semester and I brought

196
00:12:56,941 --> 00:13:00,690
it down to a three hour process and my
bosses were freaking out. They were like,

197
00:13:00,691 --> 00:13:01,800
oh my goodness,
this is amazing.

198
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,560
And there were a lot of other
things that I did that really,

199
00:13:04,561 --> 00:13:08,820
really impacted the university.
Something really,

200
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:10,380
really bad happened though.
My freshman year,

201
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,840
my mother passed away all those
years of being sick on housing.

202
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:18,540
She passed away.
My younger brother and younger sister,

203
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:21,000
my older brother and myself, we had to
try to figure out what are we going to do?

204
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,970
My older brother said, you
stay in school, work hard,

205
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:25,260
send money home on the weekends.

206
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,420
And I did that until my sophomore year.

207
00:13:30,421 --> 00:13:34,350
I became a senior lab assistant at Johnson
Wales, which I receive free tuition,

208
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:40,070
which really saved me because the school
was sending me notices that you have no

209
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:42,330
money, you can't, you
can't stay in school.

210
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,810
And I graduate Johnson Wells and
something interesting happen.

211
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,760
The second job that I had

212
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,490
was in Boston and when I was on the Cape,
my mother would tell me all the time,

213
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:58,700
pay attention or know I brought you down
here so that you could pay attention to

214
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:04,131
find out how people are becoming
successful and family after family.

215
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,970
What does your father do? Oh,
he's in a technology again,

216
00:14:08,971 --> 00:14:12,630
there was Jeff at Fred's Turkey
house are now come to the dark side,

217
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,520
but every family seemed to have some
connection to some type of technical

218
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:21,960
organization working in Boston. So I
said, I'm gonna apply to a job in Boston.

219
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:27,150
I applied for this data,
telecommunications company,
walked into the company.

220
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,470
Another shock.

221
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:33,680
I walked in and I was the only person
of color within the entire organization

222
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:36,720
and I said, they're not going
to hire him, there's no way.

223
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:41,940
But I become really good at
what I do with technology,

224
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:46,770
computer science. So I got an offer
letter in the mail and it was for $80,000

225
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,410
and it was a second time.

226
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,630
I was a shock culture shock.
The company,

227
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:02,140
much like here at Google
cafeteria food chefs coming in,

228
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:03,770
massage therapist.

229
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,590
I didn't know that it
was leading up to this.

230
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:10,933
Okay.

231
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:14,830
$80,000 a year.
$15,000 annual bonus.

232
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:20,680
15,000 shares of stock. What is
stock stock? What's, what stock

233
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:24,070
is that like Campbell's stock?

234
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:27,580
I didn't know are they gonna send
me 15,000 cans of Campbell's doc?

235
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:29,410
I don't want that.

236
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,670
But it was culture shock round to

237
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,640
something else hit me.

238
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:42,280
I was no longer poor and it was
welcome to the middle class.

239
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:47,200
But I think as hard as
it was making it there,

240
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:50,020
if I had known that it was
going to be that difficult,

241
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:55,510
I probably would have given up. But
since I made it this far, I said,

242
00:15:55,511 --> 00:15:59,020
well why stop at the middle class?
Why not keep on going?

243
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:01,120
What's the next second exit having store?

244
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:07,030
So something interesting
started happening. My friends,

245
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:11,620
family and neighbors started noticing,
oh Arielle, it's a new clothes,

246
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:14,200
new car,
living in a nice house.

247
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,620
So people were peaking and then

248
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:21,040
people started knocking on my door.
Especially my friends.

249
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,120
I have a friend that was in the
marines and he came up to me, says,

250
00:16:26,121 --> 00:16:29,000
Arnelle listen, I just got an a marines
cause all I need to do is shoot a gun.

251
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:31,880
What do I do?
I got them involved in technology,

252
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:36,380
in and out to him.
His name is Jason,

253
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,110
he's African American and
another friend of mine,

254
00:16:39,111 --> 00:16:43,580
Rick Jamaican background, Hov, Cambodian,

255
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:48,830
Tim, Irish American, Dave English,

256
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:54,710
Osi Latino, Tim, Kevin, Derrick,
Sam, Charlie Lin, John, Mike will,

257
00:16:54,711 --> 00:16:57,170
Jeff, chuck, Devin,
[inaudible], rob, Kurt,

258
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:02,320
so many other people that
he started coming to me and
my friends to get involved

259
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:04,610
in technology,
people who were on welfare,

260
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:09,970
unemployed or severely underemployed
overall about 25 people

261
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,900
who now have an aggregate annual
income of over $2 million.

262
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:23,420
And if you look at the majority of those
people all got married, all own homes.

263
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:28,220
And so that cycle that my mother was
caught up in and that so many other people

264
00:17:28,221 --> 00:17:30,140
were caught in single mother,

265
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:35,240
no father in the household was now
being broken in so many people's lives.

266
00:17:35,241 --> 00:17:37,670
And so many children,
including myself,

267
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:43,450
my two amazing sons right here in
my amazing wife who I would not,

268
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,870
I would not be here without.
And

269
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,180
so I started thinking again,

270
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,430
how do we solve the
income inequality puzzle?

271
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,900
And the solution is simple.
We have to do it at scale.

272
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:06,090
And that's where I really began thinking
about the rebooting emerging domestic

273
00:18:06,091 --> 00:18:06,924
markets.

274
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,300
So I had my great moment of epiphany,
seeing it,

275
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:16,570
what all of my friends had attained.
And then over the past few years,

276
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:21,660
looking at all of the pain that this
country has been going through with the

277
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:28,180
battles between race and income
and the haves and have nots.

278
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,850
I said,
what I've done for my friends,

279
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,860
I simply need to do for the
rest of the country. That's
easy, right? No problem. So

280
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,030
I started a company
called Intercity Geeks.

281
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,410
It's a nonprofit and something
interesting happened.

282
00:18:44,411 --> 00:18:49,411
I put an ad up on Brown university's
website and this double major at my econ

283
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,500
brainiac named Rapides binkies applied.
I sit down with them,

284
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,240
blew me away with his intelligence.

285
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,820
He worked with me getting
the organization going.

286
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:04,630
And then I met another gentleman
and he's here today in the audience.

287
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,340
His name is cliff.

288
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:08,780
Yeah,

289
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,650
brainiac. You've seen like
the superman comics brainiac.

290
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:16,010
That's cliff right there and we'll
talk a little bit more about that,

291
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,750
but interested he geeks.

292
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:22,780
We started teaching at the middle school
level in providence and it got picked

293
00:19:23,751 --> 00:19:27,080
up in the news like, wow, this is
really cool. No one's done this before,

294
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:32,390
or at least not at the scale that we
were looking to to run our programs.

295
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:37,760
We were in channel 10 we're taking
students to hackathons at Brown university

296
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,440
and they were growing. They were
doing amazing things of themselves.

297
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:45,860
In the red shirt here you
can see my son Matthias,

298
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,870
he actually teaches with me now.

299
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:53,330
He's a lead instructor for elementary
school students. He's 14 years old,

300
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:57,410
eighth grader, actually
not 14 yet. In a few weeks

301
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,103
he's going to be,

302
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:06,620
but he's doing amazing things and
again that generational stronghold,

303
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,070
that generational change effect.
Having a father figure,

304
00:20:10,071 --> 00:20:15,071
a mother figure that's nurturing him
to help him grow in Elias is coming up

305
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:17,540
behind learning as well.

306
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:22,520
So we went from middle schools
to high schools teaching,

307
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:24,770
talking about how they can
get jobs in technology.

308
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:28,760
Seventy thousand seventy two thousand
dollars is the average of the PA jobs

309
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:33,620
paying and Rhode Island, the mayor
of providence contacted us and said,

310
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:36,920
hey, you're doing some great
things. What can we do together?

311
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:39,290
So we created a hackathon
for the city of Providence

312
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:43,280
and not just any hackathon,

313
00:20:43,281 --> 00:20:46,970
but we were also recognized
by President Obama for our,

314
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:51,010
it was on the White House
website August 4th, 2015

315
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,090
the culture shock is continuing to happen.

316
00:20:55,091 --> 00:20:58,330
I'm seeing the vision fulfilled
of what we're trying to do.

317
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:03,580
And for one of the hackathons that we did,
what we attempted to do,

318
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,370
we built a satellite communications array
to communicate with the astronauts and

319
00:21:09,371 --> 00:21:13,120
the International Space Station as
it flew overhead over Providence,

320
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:15,580
the astronauts with sleeping.

321
00:21:15,581 --> 00:21:20,140
But we did get a ping connection
signal with our device and,

322
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:23,560
but we've stressed to the students.
When we did this,

323
00:21:23,561 --> 00:21:25,390
we partnered with a group
from Brown University,

324
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:30,220
middle school students and high school
students who assembled the communications

325
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:33,730
array,
designed it and got it working.

326
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:38,380
This is the type of innovation that we
want to let students know as possible and

327
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:41,020
they're like, now they go out there
and they have the apps on their phone.

328
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,210
I've had, I get calls from
students all the time, Hey,

329
00:21:43,211 --> 00:21:46,240
I'm looking at the international
space station going overhead.

330
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:50,680
I'm following them on Twitter. Right,
and they're talking about engineering,

331
00:21:50,681 --> 00:21:52,000
they're talking about aeronautics.

332
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:55,780
These are the types of impacts and changes
that you want to be to make everyone

333
00:21:55,781 --> 00:22:00,530
can't move to Cape Cod. After that, the
governor of Rhode Island got in contact,

334
00:22:00,531 --> 00:22:03,550
have contact with us through her
innovation department and we created a

335
00:22:03,551 --> 00:22:04,570
hackathon for the state.

336
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:10,060
I also taught a Harvard computer science
class called CS 50 in Rhode Island.

337
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,790
Over 500 people applied.

338
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:17,820
We enrolled 150 and cs 50 is rooted
in the c programming language,

339
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,880
data structures, algorithms,
computational thinking,

340
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,550
strong,
strong rigor,

341
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:29,230
and it was during that course
and here's a snapshot of it.

342
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:34,000
That's my head there.
I'll give you that same view,

343
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:40,660
but during that class I met one student
that approached me halfway through.

344
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,900
Everyone was two or three
weeks behind in the,

345
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:45,460
except for one student who comes up to me
and says, I'm finished with the course.

346
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:50,560
I said, you can't be. That was
cliff. Toward the end of the class,

347
00:22:50,561 --> 00:22:55,561
Harvard had a global computer comp coding
competition and cliff's team was only

348
00:22:57,041 --> 00:23:02,041
one of 13 that finished with a perfect
score out of 630 something teams

349
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:07,180
worldwide. Perfect score. I was impressed.

350
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:12,620
We be in a hanging out a little bit and
cliff became my third geek crush that I

351
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:17,260
had in my life. The first was Jeff
rule from Fred's Turkey house.

352
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:20,200
The second was rapid lists and then cliff.

353
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:26,980
So from there we formed career Deb's
in career. DEB's is the for profit arm.

354
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:30,190
We're launching our computer science
training academy this summer.

355
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,970
Are we teaching people in Rhode
Island and New York in Boston?

356
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,260
Rigorous computer science.

357
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:40,000
We were just in Brooklyn two weeks ago.

358
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:45,300
We're coming back again in May and there
are 36 schools in the five boroughs.

359
00:23:46,161 --> 00:23:50,240
Had an interested in having career
debs do work there. Same in Boston,

360
00:23:50,241 --> 00:23:54,440
same in Rhode Island, so we're
expanding rapidly. In addition in our,

361
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,810
the way that we're going to do computer
science is different than a boot camp,

362
00:23:56,811 --> 00:24:01,811
so we don't call it a computer science
bootcamp because the students are really

363
00:24:02,031 --> 00:24:05,330
going to
two.

364
00:24:05,331 --> 00:24:07,580
Oftentimes when we see students
graduating from boot camps,

365
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:12,940
they can't do anything significant
when they complete the course,

366
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:18,670
so we want to make sure that there's
a lot of testing in a lot of rigor in

367
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:21,440
ideation at every stage.

368
00:24:21,441 --> 00:24:25,580
We want to make sure that
this is a creation portion
that they can reiterate and

369
00:24:25,581 --> 00:24:29,390
from recall,
do examples that they create.

370
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:34,340
S really, really important. Plus the
focus on data structures and algorithms,

371
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:39,440
which cliff is a Jedi knight over. That'd
be a cit since we were in a dark side,

372
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,133
probably see it.

373
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:45,080
The other thing that's interesting is
that I've had several entrepreneurial

374
00:24:45,081 --> 00:24:49,790
journeys over the years and a couple
of years ago I created a organization

375
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:50,810
called crowd signed

376
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:56,840
and I applied to one of the big
incubators and I thought, wow,

377
00:24:56,841 --> 00:24:59,180
they're going to love my idea,
and they rejected me.

378
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:02,540
I didn't have an understanding of metrics,
total address,

379
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:05,090
total adjustable market space.
I didn't. There were a lot,

380
00:25:05,091 --> 00:25:08,360
there were a lot of things that I didn't
understand, so I had to hit the books.

381
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,670
One of my friends said, oh, go up to MIT.

382
00:25:10,671 --> 00:25:15,260
They're having this course
on entrepreneurship. So I
went up there, registered,

383
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:19,790
sat in on it, learned a ton. It's like,
oh bill, all that. He has his great book.

384
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:23,660
You should check it out.
Disciplined entrepreneurship.

385
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,250
So I internalize that
and as I've done that,

386
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:30,740
several of the people
have come to me now saying

387
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:36,920
they want some entrepreneurial help
with their products the same way.

388
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:40,760
In the same way that I helped my
friends learning about computer science,

389
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:45,710
I'm now helping people learn about
entrepreneurship. So cliff and myself,

390
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:49,760
we're going to be also teaching
about entrepreneurship and

391
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:55,190
as creatives launches, two of the
companies that we're highlighting,

392
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,960
one is called common connect.

393
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:05,330
It allows you to connect with people as
you would with linkedin professionally,

394
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:11,130
but socially based upon your location.
How many times are you traveling?

395
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:16,340
You're walking past someone on eighth
or ninth or 16th that you could probably

396
00:26:17,401 --> 00:26:20,100
have a lot of synergy with,
but you don't know that person.

397
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,490
Now with common connecting your pocket
when you're passing that person you'll

398
00:26:23,491 --> 00:26:26,460
know and since you're in the same
vicinity you'll be able to connect.

399
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:28,890
Another one is called cross sign

400
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:36,080
informed analytics that helped drive
the market for unsigned artists.

401
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,080
So it's data driven,
analytic driven,

402
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:49,670
innovative IP behind both of
these companies that we're
launching and cliffs the

403
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:52,950
lead developer on both of those.
So what's our vision?

404
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:57,720
It's the same thing that happened with
my friends, but instead of people.

405
00:26:57,721 --> 00:27:00,240
Now we're also looking at corporations,

406
00:27:00,241 --> 00:27:04,230
companies difference being
not just starting a business,

407
00:27:04,231 --> 00:27:09,231
but what's a scalable innovation driven
I p portfolio driven incubator look like

408
00:27:14,311 --> 00:27:16,830
that's designed for the
under skilled in underserved.

409
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:20,490
Because I've been
convinced by bill all let

410
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:25,800
and people from Brown
university like Dan Warsh, Shea,

411
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:29,790
anyone can learn entrepreneurship in,

412
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:33,720
anyone can learn computer science if
they apply themselves long enough,

413
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:38,880
if they hack at it long enough. And so
our goal is to create this multiplier,

414
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,650
this network multiplier that will really
bring upon this error where we can

415
00:27:43,651 --> 00:27:46,890
reboot emerging domestic
markets here in this country.

416
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:51,480
And so over time stay tuned in.
Thank you.

417
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,273
Thanks.

418
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:05,060
If you are interested in getting
contact with us or following our story,

419
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:08,600
you can follow along on
city geeks.org Korea,

420
00:28:08,601 --> 00:28:12,500
devs.com and you can email
cliff myself as noted.

421
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,173
Thanks once again.

422
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,673
So

423
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,640
we're going to take a couple of questions.

424
00:28:20,641 --> 00:28:24,840
If anyone has any questions they can
feel free to ask them in or if you're

425
00:28:24,841 --> 00:28:29,760
interested in working for
us and leaving Google. Yes.

426
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,200
And we have microphones over that.

427
00:28:31,201 --> 00:28:33,990
So we're going to have each person
stand up at a microphone to ask their

428
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,833
questions.

429
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:39,700
Throughout all of the struggles that
you faced with to your friend, you know,

430
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:41,470
cities moving back and forth,

431
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:46,750
what kept you so motivated to continue
to go from the lower class to middle

432
00:28:46,751 --> 00:28:49,960
class to now being obviously
a very wealthy individual?

433
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:55,100
Oh, I don't know if I would say very
wealthy individual, but, uh, um,

434
00:28:55,420 --> 00:29:00,310
I took an Uber here this morning,
didn't have a chauffeur, but, um,

435
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:03,970
my motivation
was

436
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:11,390
interesting. So here's an
interesting story that from Cape Cod,

437
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,900
I remember once being out in the ocean
with some of my friends and one of my

438
00:29:14,901 --> 00:29:16,730
friends said, hey, let's
swim out to my father's boat.

439
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,320
It was that type of situation.

440
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,750
So we're swimming out to what we
thought was his father's boat.

441
00:29:20,751 --> 00:29:23,480
Then he told us he was joking, he
goes, this is my father's boat.

442
00:29:23,481 --> 00:29:25,550
It's that went out there
as much further away.

443
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,360
And so in that situation there

444
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,930
you just keep swimming
cause you have to swim.

445
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,080
And as I

446
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,760
made it one mile or pass one goal,

447
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:45,650
I just kept going and I kept swimming and,
and then once I,

448
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:49,060
like I said, because when I made it
to the middle class, that's okay,

449
00:29:49,061 --> 00:29:52,120
why did this now?
And even though it's hard work,

450
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:57,490
I'm going to keep going because I looked
back at a lot of my friends and family

451
00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:00,400
that were in Boston.
Everyone's working hard,

452
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:03,940
whether you're a lower class,
middle class or upper class,

453
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:08,200
everyone has a pretty hard life in terms
of the hours that you have to put in

454
00:30:08,201 --> 00:30:09,310
and different things of that nature.

455
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:13,870
So I'd rather work hard to bring about
success and also try to bring people

456
00:30:13,871 --> 00:30:17,890
along with me. So it's just, you know,
I've never really thought about why.

457
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,480
So to answer your question,
I don't know,

458
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:24,370
but it's just something you don't give up,
you just can't give up.

459
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:27,520
And I know that I had my younger
brother and sister and that was a great

460
00:30:27,521 --> 00:30:28,960
motivating factor for me as well.

461
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:34,890
And then once they were set at friends
and family that came along and you know,

462
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:40,990
you always see needs and I guess you see
needs and needs that need to be met and

463
00:30:41,921 --> 00:30:46,240
you go for it. Thank
you. Any other questions?

464
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:49,203
Yes.

465
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:53,400
All right. Thanks for checking your story.
I really appreciate it. Great. Thank you.

466
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:57,910
Talk about how the goal in a inner city
geeks is to help do help inner city

467
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:02,460
youth make the jump to middleclass
through technology jobs.

468
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,990
Have you considered looking into other
professions like law, medicine, finance,

469
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:10,270
and other professions for people who
may not find themselves very acute to

470
00:31:10,271 --> 00:31:11,104
technology?

471
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:15,500
Yes, and I believe that will be the
goal. But like with most things,

472
00:31:15,501 --> 00:31:19,130
when you're starting something, you
can only do one thing well, right?

473
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:22,580
You can only do one thing.
Well. And for instance,

474
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:25,850
Google started off doing just a search
engine and now you guys are doing a

475
00:31:25,851 --> 00:31:30,470
couple of things in addition to search,
right?

476
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:34,250
And so yes, but we do want to be able to
expand to bring more people into that.

477
00:31:34,251 --> 00:31:38,870
Cause not everyone's going
to be a programmer or a
network engineer. Right? Yeah.

478
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,100
Thank you.
Thank you.

479
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,970
Hey, so thank you for taking
the town and sharing your story.

480
00:31:44,971 --> 00:31:47,120
So what is success for
inner city geeks into?

481
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:48,700
What do you guys want
to accomplish over time?

482
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:55,320
So success for intercity geeks
and career Devs is pretty,

483
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:59,650
pretty large.
I always ask the question

484
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,960
in a seems, it seems crazy when I hear
it, when I hear the goal in my head,

485
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:09,890
it sounds crazy. But when
you think of John F. Kennedy
was standing up and saying,

486
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:14,440
[inaudible] in that New England accent,
we're going to,

487
00:32:14,441 --> 00:32:17,700
by the end of this decade, we're going
to put one man on the moon. Right?

488
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:24,240
Or you look at the accomplishments of
individuals and companies such as Google

489
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,670
self driving cars.

490
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:29,903
Oh,

491
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:35,580
the work that's being done with tensor
flow and machine learning and just all

492
00:32:35,801 --> 00:32:40,430
the advances that that's bringing out.
Bringing about my goal is to,

493
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:42,770
it's been talked about so much,

494
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:48,940
but I really believe that in America we
can set the example for having balanced

495
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,680
income equality.

496
00:32:55,490 --> 00:33:00,490
Not everyone is going to be a Jeff
Bezos or Larry Page or a Bill Gates,

497
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:02,810
but you don't,

498
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:07,810
you don't have to have large swaths of
our society that are living in squalor.

499
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,260
I believe that we can,

500
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:17,420
in the impact that people have that
are underserved and under skilled,

501
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:22,840
they can contribute to the might of the
American economic engine to make us an

502
00:33:24,021 --> 00:33:29,021
even stronger in greater country and
that's not just for urban markets,

503
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:34,700
but that's also for a suburban markets.
W the principal from my high school,

504
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:35,271
it says,
oh no,

505
00:33:35,271 --> 00:33:40,271
we need you to come here to the Cape
because we have those pockets of under

506
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,320
skilled people here.

507
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,750
And so it's not just an urban thing is
to start a black thing or a Latino thing

508
00:33:47,751 --> 00:33:51,020
or a a white thing. There are poor
people everywhere in this country,

509
00:33:51,021 --> 00:33:55,250
and that's my goal. My goal is to
create balanced income equality.

510
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,100
Well, thanks. Once again.

511
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:02,120
I really appreciate the opportunity
being here and we'll see you next time.

512
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:08,160
[inaudible].
