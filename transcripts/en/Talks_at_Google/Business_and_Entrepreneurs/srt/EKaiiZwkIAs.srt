17
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:15,890
Let's welcome our speak speaker.

18
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:24,000
Uh,
you had,

19
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,410
uh, you had an unusual, the beginning, uh,

20
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:34,780
often spending nearly 30 years in banking.
You came back to Pakistan,

21
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:38,810
just start a new venture at the age of 49.
Um,

22
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:43,530
what was easy and what was hard to
start something new at that age.

23
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:48,980
And how did you decide to
start a microfinance back
back in Boston after having

24
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,580
lived in different countries?

25
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,580
So I spent about 27 years,

26
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,670
but Citi group in about
eight different countries.

27
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,530
And my last assignment was actually out
of the Bible that was disposable for

28
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:05,730
Iraq during the sovereign debt
restructuring. So of that 27 years,

29
00:02:05,731 --> 00:02:08,700
I'd spent half my time in investment,

30
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,130
consumer banking and half
my diamond disc management.

31
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,630
I was 49 years old and I'd figured
out that pretty seven years,

32
00:02:15,631 --> 00:02:19,920
I'd only spent five years in Pakistan
launching the consumer banking Pakistan.

33
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:24,990
Otherwise I'd been outside Pakistan and
I felt it was time for me to go back and

34
00:02:24,991 --> 00:02:27,930
do something in Pakistan.
Pakistan had been kind to me.

35
00:02:27,931 --> 00:02:30,330
I got where I had because of my,
you know,

36
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:35,340
education in Pakistan and subsequently
in the u s but I want this tag of saying

37
00:02:35,341 --> 00:02:37,650
that I've done enough of city,
you know,

38
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:42,060
I had become relatively senior
in Citi bank making decent money,

39
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,890
but I wanted to go back and create
something in Pakistan, which would be,

40
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,520
I hoped I would be able
to change an industry.

41
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:55,050
It was very ambitious for a person who
had only worked five years in Pakistan

42
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,870
and had actually never
done microfinance before.

43
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:03,670
And reason I wanted to do microfinance
were two fold. One was simply capital.

44
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:08,300
If I want to do own a bank in Pakistan,
a commercial bank capital requirement,

45
00:03:08,301 --> 00:03:12,740
it was $100 million and a microfinance
capital requirement was 10 million donors.

46
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,301
As you can see,

47
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:17,260
that decision was an easy decision to
get into as far as capital department.

48
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:18,094
It was a good son,

49
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:23,610
but this huge financial exclusion in
Pakistan of our country right now have 200

50
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,633
million people.

51
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:28,810
Less than 6.7 million people
have access to formal credit.

52
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,130
So my view was that if we could
create a microfinance bank,

53
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:37,480
which could actually structural as this
process, do, you know, create a bag,

54
00:03:37,481 --> 00:03:39,970
which was done by professionals
as opposed to necessarily.

55
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:42,550
But it's not that the other
institution I'd run by professional,

56
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,720
but people who had cabinet,
Margaret Experience,

57
00:03:44,721 --> 00:03:48,100
people who are consumer experience,
people who are global experience.

58
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,000
You would have to learn microfinance
because all my knowledge of microfinance

59
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:56,560
was a book written by Doctor Eunice.
So I hadn't done microfinance before,

60
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,850
so that was a challenge.

61
00:03:57,851 --> 00:04:02,790
But I taught it we will be able to create
a world class institution using the 27

62
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:07,050
years of knowledge I had at city and the
capital had buildup at city, you know,

63
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,050
two options.

64
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:13,210
And was it the funny part is
that when I exited Citibank,

65
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,250
Citibank stark was $35 you know,
it came down to close to $2 afterwards.

66
00:04:18,251 --> 00:04:23,050
So there wasn't, you know, my
bar, it was, you know, uh, luck.

67
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:27,130
But right now I was reading the Citi
Bank stock is cynical of stock is back to

68
00:04:27,131 --> 00:04:29,260
2009 years.
It was at night.

69
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,800
It was a big decision in the sense
that I'd spent 27 years working for one

70
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:39,070
company, getting a salary in a very
comfortable environment. You know,

71
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:41,380
when you're getting a check every month,
you're getting a nice bonus.

72
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:45,040
Every year you get transported to a new
country and the company takes care of

73
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:49,450
you. It's a nice life and it's not boring
because you're moving from country to

74
00:04:49,451 --> 00:04:52,470
country. So the new market, so
you're always getting, you know,

75
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,410
a different experience. When
I was growing up, you know,

76
00:04:56,411 --> 00:04:58,380
like most Pakistani's at that stage,

77
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:02,890
my ambition was to become a
head of a multinational in
Pakistan because you know,

78
00:05:02,891 --> 00:05:06,670
it's a great job. You get a lot of perks,
make 1 million bucks and I'd be done.

79
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,440
You know, that was my initial ambition.
Uh, you know, I'd be happy camp.

80
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:16,360
I never had that stage taught at work
for myself or create a company for myself

81
00:05:16,361 --> 00:05:21,361
because that whole mindset that
I was to go find a multinational,

82
00:05:21,911 --> 00:05:23,020
do work for,
you know,

83
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:27,040
and get promoted and become a country
head or maybe a regional head.

84
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,190
So the first transition was that I
would be creating my own company and my

85
00:05:33,191 --> 00:05:36,130
family comes from a
middle class in Pakistan.

86
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,120
My father used to be in the Pakistan
Navy and then garden and the automotive

87
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:42,910
industry.
My mother was a high school principal.

88
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:47,440
There was no examples of any
entrepreneurship in my family.

89
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:52,420
So I was the first person to
actually move from a salary job into,

90
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,400
you know,
an entrepreneurship kind of thing.

91
00:05:54,401 --> 00:05:56,950
So that was the first
decision moving away,

92
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,860
the safety net of a nice
tax free job in Dubai,

93
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:06,020
coming back to Pakistan and you know,
putting my own capital at risk.

94
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:10,030
So out of the 10 million, you
know, I put in $6 million IFC,

95
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,870
we know $1 million,

96
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:15,260
and they would do local investors that
put in 3 million to get to the 10 million.

97
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:19,520
The second thing was I had never
worked in Pakistan beyond five years.

98
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,580
And actually I was a Pakistani,

99
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,320
used to go back every year to Pakistan
working in Pakistan, you know,

100
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,340
especially in the microfinance
environment would be very different.

101
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:33,020
So that was another challenge, uh, that,
uh, you know, I knew I would experience,

102
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,900
but I'm impulsive kind of person.

103
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,170
So once the bug bit me that
I was going to walk back,

104
00:06:39,171 --> 00:06:42,350
I actually didn't even paid for my bonus
that dia incidentally would've been

105
00:06:42,351 --> 00:06:46,010
half a million bucks because we had
just finished the sovereign debt,

106
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:49,820
destruction of Pakistan and the city bag
and made close to $120 million on that

107
00:06:49,821 --> 00:06:54,170
deal. It was a massive deed.
Uh, so I was country had Iraq,

108
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,890
but I, I couldn't wait so I
just given my resignation.

109
00:06:57,891 --> 00:07:01,150
So going to go back to Pakistan and
you know, my boss said, you know,

110
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,110
you're going to be going on for
abiding by, it was four months away.

111
00:07:03,111 --> 00:07:04,970
I didn't know. I can't
wait. I've got to go back.

112
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:08,550
And I just went back and
started talking about bank.

113
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,380
Well my current to prices tend
to estimate the demand side.

114
00:07:12,381 --> 00:07:16,970
Interest rates are typically higher
for microloans and recent randomized

115
00:07:16,971 --> 00:07:20,840
controlled trials show that direct
cash transfers that is cash without any

116
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:25,790
strings attached, has more impact
on poverty and livelihoods.

117
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,570
So how does tend in all bag,
uh,

118
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:32,990
ensure that micro loans side impactful
in upward mobility and breaking out of

119
00:07:32,991 --> 00:07:34,880
the poverty cycle for the communities.

120
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,040
I thought this is,
we want to be easy interview.

121
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:43,790
So there are two schools of thought and
both come up with scientific evidence.

122
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,880
One says in the controlled
group environment,

123
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:49,790
when you do microfinance lending,

124
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:52,130
it would a period of time we
actually show improvement.

125
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:57,350
And there's not an equal group of people
who actually demonstrate that. No,

126
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,330
you cannot isolate that improvement.
Whether it's uh, you know,

127
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,760
floor that had been
converted from you know,

128
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:10,910
mud to wood or a bathroom within put in
or kids are going to school or there's

129
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:16,060
less people getting sick because of the
incremental income that you have is not

130
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:18,800
necessarily due to the intervention
of the microfinance bank,

131
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:22,050
but they could be other sources
of income coming in and you put,

132
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,610
because money's fungible,
you can't necessarily isolate the impact.

133
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:30,530
Microfinance lending is ag.
So both exist and you know,

134
00:08:30,531 --> 00:08:34,970
both I've done by very prominent people
who've done ab testing and demonstrated

135
00:08:34,971 --> 00:08:37,370
that deer right in my 11 years,

136
00:08:37,371 --> 00:08:42,350
my sense was that I met enough customers
that we changed the lives that we know

137
00:08:42,351 --> 00:08:46,130
then dimension we had done had made
them actually better off than they were

138
00:08:46,131 --> 00:08:46,964
before.

139
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,490
The big risk in microfinance is that
over in depthness you get a customer,

140
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:55,950
do we actually take more money than he
or she can rebate and that's when the

141
00:08:55,951 --> 00:08:59,910
default, otherwise it typically the
rates of default and microfinance,

142
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:01,650
if you got the right underwriting,

143
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:06,730
I typically in the 1% the big challenge
in microfinance is not that your

144
00:09:08,071 --> 00:09:10,260
customer is going to default
because they don't have,

145
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:13,500
they haven't given you collateral.
It's your business model.

146
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,080
How do you take care of
the long tail customer?

147
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:20,610
Your Business Model takes into account
that you're going to sell as opposed to a

148
00:09:20,611 --> 00:09:23,280
bag of tea bags,
one sachet at the time.

149
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:27,600
So you have to build a business model
that incorporates it just selling one

150
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:30,780
sachet at a time.
And unless you can do that,

151
00:09:30,781 --> 00:09:33,930
and that's why large commercial banks are
not successful in microfinance because

152
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,900
their business model is
very different as you know,

153
00:09:36,901 --> 00:09:41,460
mandarin million dollars or $10
million or $200,000 of loan at a time.

154
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,760
But microfinance is one loan acquired at
a time for an average of maybe $350 or

155
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:52,260
$300 where the customer has
no finances, no, you know,

156
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,840
credit report of any kind.

157
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:59,760
And you're actually estimating the
ability to repay the debt service by human

158
00:09:59,761 --> 00:10:00,594
intervention.

159
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:05,460
And that's the reason the typically
microfinance rates a high,

160
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,670
it's not because microfinance
banks make a lot of money.

161
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,430
So if you look at globally,
what kind of, you know,

162
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:15,510
money microfinance banks make or
microfinance institutions make,

163
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:18,610
it's not a very high number.
You will send them,

164
00:10:18,611 --> 00:10:22,860
you'll find a microphone has magnetic
bank making $100 million of $50 million

165
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,530
income. It's rare, I would say,
you know, a good current, you know,

166
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:28,710
but 10 banks globally would do that.

167
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:34,250
The reason the rates are highest is the
cost of customer acquisition and the

168
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:39,760
cost of underwriting.
So if you look at an industry that's it,

169
00:10:39,761 --> 00:10:41,940
industry is 30% and you
said, well, you know,

170
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:46,170
you're going to be poor guy and you're
learning at 30% and that's not fair.

171
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,750
I mean, you're gouging. The
customer is already very poor.

172
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:52,320
So what service are you providing?
You've just maximizing your own returns.

173
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,500
But if you break and
peel that onion of 30%,

174
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:58,500
you find out that out of that 30%,

175
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,090
typically 15% is customer administration.
Why?

176
00:11:03,091 --> 00:11:05,130
Because there's no,
I mean,

177
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,620
very few microfinance banks
use scorecards for the Bowman.

178
00:11:07,621 --> 00:11:09,180
So everything is human intervention.

179
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:14,830
Tommy Bank at 2000 people by the time I
was exiting because you need to go and

180
00:11:16,321 --> 00:11:17,310
see the customer,

181
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,400
you need to figure it out at the
able to repay your debt or not.

182
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:25,080
So you have to go a couple of times to
figure out what their repayment ability

183
00:11:25,081 --> 00:11:25,914
is.

184
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,090
Because typically in developing country
that that level corruption is high

185
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:33,810
because these people are
not used to getting anything
done without paying money.

186
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:38,850
So if they need a passport, they need,
uh, you know, uh, a CAC card, which is,

187
00:11:38,851 --> 00:11:39,060
you know,

188
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,270
like identity because they're always
being some kind of money to touching

189
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:43,140
between.

190
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:47,280
So typically the imagery
immediately offering money
to your relationship manager

191
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,050
and that's something you,
you know,

192
00:11:49,051 --> 00:11:52,380
you want to avoid because you want to
have a culture where money's being taken.

193
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,100
So you have a separate person.

194
00:11:54,101 --> 00:11:58,450
We ain't gonna benefit ration process
when they go and recheck that the

195
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:02,260
customer's estimation of what you're
estimating the EPM and is correct.

196
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,690
When you have to talk to the neighbor
to see if this person living in is,

197
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:07,910
you know,
how has been a long time or what type of,

198
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,840
then you go to his place of work
and talk to his neighbor again.

199
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:15,010
So it's a very laborious people
intensive process. It commercial banks,

200
00:12:15,011 --> 00:12:20,011
customer administration is typically
around 2% 3% it microfinance banks is 15%

201
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:26,150
then you have pasta funds that typically
commercial banks have low cost to fire

202
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,110
because they have checking accounts
or they have savings accounts.

203
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:32,000
Typically microfinance banks
don't have checking card.

204
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:34,550
They can tell me the bank had one,
uh,

205
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:38,290
but most magnifier and banks and dependent
on going to the interbank market to

206
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:42,790
raise money because the customer's
view is if I have to borrow money,

207
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:45,820
I borrowed from microfinance bag,
but if I have to deposit money,

208
00:12:45,821 --> 00:12:49,710
I'll go to a commercial bank because
your money's safe. So if I'm to,

209
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,820
that's the kind of fat,
if you're willing to lend to me,

210
00:12:51,821 --> 00:12:56,030
you can't be all that
you know, uh, you know,

211
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,810
strong and by your capital.
Adequacy is concerned.

212
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,460
So it takes time for
microfinance banks to,

213
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:06,220
you use the cost of funds to typically
you borrowing 300 basis points over the

214
00:13:06,221 --> 00:13:10,420
money market rate. So let's save the money
market brain Pakistan was 6% typical.

215
00:13:10,421 --> 00:13:11,980
My girlfriend has borrowed,
we'll borrow it,

216
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:17,010
nine to 10% so 15% plus 10% like 25%
let's say the Ford is 1% so you're 26% if

217
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:22,990
your margin of one or 2% at
28 so the rates are high,

218
00:13:22,991 --> 00:13:27,760
but that's the decent
rates. If microfinance bag
start embracing technology,

219
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,730
you can bring the
administration countdown.

220
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:35,380
If every time you'd approving secondary
using score cards or artificial

221
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:38,200
intelligence to create algorithms,
we can forecast,

222
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:40,720
you know what your default
rate is going to be.

223
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:45,940
You can bring some of the administration
cost dunk. If you create, you know,

224
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:48,100
checking account or
mobile account program,

225
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:52,120
you can bring your cost of funding down.
So my timing,

226
00:13:52,121 --> 00:13:53,620
my ambition was to bring art.

227
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:58,670
[inaudible] was 28% trimming it down to
15% and credit card rates in Pakistan at

228
00:13:58,741 --> 00:14:03,700
30 32% so, you know, hopefully the new
management is looking towards that.

229
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,680
But that's the reason,
you know,

230
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:10,870
microfinance is rates range from 30% to
40% but they don't make that much money.

231
00:14:10,871 --> 00:14:13,490
It's because of the way this
whole business model is.

232
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:20,560
So tell it all that has created and
instituted a successful mobile payment

233
00:14:20,561 --> 00:14:25,561
system called easy besser and many have
tried to introduce mobile money in Asia,

234
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,760
but they've been right through successes.

235
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,360
How did go about creating
a new infrastructure and
network to enable the mobile

236
00:14:34,361 --> 00:14:37,990
money? What are the challenges you
faced and how did you overcome that?

237
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:39,270
So,

238
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:44,270
so the biggest challenge in creating a
mobile distribution network is behavior

239
00:14:45,671 --> 00:14:50,671
change or you got to realize that the
poor are willing to pay for services.

240
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:55,460
They don't want charity.
And their view of value for money is much,

241
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:59,780
much more acute than yours and mine.
So, you know, we spent some extra money,

242
00:14:59,781 --> 00:15:03,800
but they have a finite budget and they
have to work within that and they're

243
00:15:03,801 --> 00:15:06,110
willing to pay for value.
If you create value,

244
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,030
they now we're never
going to be pay for one,

245
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:11,930
but this is a behavior change requirement.
So when we looked at Pakistan,

246
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,250
you know, and, and we said, listen,

247
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,750
this financial exclusion that we
have is not limited to credit.

248
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:21,960
It's also limited to savings.
Since 1947 or Pakistan was created,

249
00:15:21,961 --> 00:15:23,510
it's could be 70 years.
You know,

250
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:28,660
this month the entire commercial
banking industry's only open close to 32

251
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:32,210
million bank accounts.
And if I take unique bank account,

252
00:15:32,211 --> 00:15:36,530
you're probably talking about 15 million
and the savings to GDP ration Pakistan

253
00:15:36,531 --> 00:15:41,510
is under 6% so we said there ought to
be a solution for savings as well and

254
00:15:41,511 --> 00:15:44,690
savings can generation get
generated when you start payments.

255
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:48,620
So how do we create a payment
culture, parks, a cash society,

256
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,150
and there's about three point 3 trillion
repeats of money floating in the system

257
00:15:53,151 --> 00:15:56,720
because everybody plays catch in
a country of 200 million people.

258
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,810
Unfortunately registered
taxpayers are about 1.2 million.

259
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:03,470
The bulk of the taxes are collected
or indirect places. So you know,

260
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,300
people don't have bank accounts,

261
00:16:05,301 --> 00:16:08,960
they want to keep money but
they use money all the time.

262
00:16:08,961 --> 00:16:13,220
Cash and cash is
expensive. Uh, you know a,

263
00:16:13,221 --> 00:16:16,670
there I depreciate in terms, you know
its physical form you need to carry,

264
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:21,200
it can get stolen. So if
you can do digital payments
many ways you're better off.

265
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:25,610
So we said, okay, we want to get
into the brightness banking business.

266
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,530
And again,

267
00:16:27,531 --> 00:16:32,531
the idea of easy Pesa didn't just come
to me and I went to Kenya to look at m

268
00:16:34,101 --> 00:16:35,470
Pesa.
I went to Philippines,

269
00:16:35,471 --> 00:16:40,010
need to look at g cash and I looked
at various applications and said and

270
00:16:40,011 --> 00:16:42,020
obviously telling,
nor was a partner at that time.

271
00:16:42,021 --> 00:16:43,700
So they had some insights as well.

272
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:49,540
And we said the easiest way to get
people to start using Brandis banking is

273
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,920
payment of utility bills.

274
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,710
Now you guys talk typically
pay through your phone maybe,

275
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:58,670
but in Pakistan every month,
other than the telco payments,

276
00:16:58,671 --> 00:17:02,720
30 million utility bills
are created core power, gas,

277
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,033
water,

278
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:08,700
and people typically go to
a bank getting online in a,

279
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:12,590
during banking hours, give up the
work time to make that payment.

280
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,660
And bags hate these people
because they can just the lobby.

281
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:19,550
So can again imagine they're not bank
customer that is coming to page to dibels

282
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:22,640
and the standing and the teller.
Why the bank customers on the side.

283
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,900
So the main mega as difficult as
possible for these guys to play. Uh,

284
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,540
but that was the only venue and we said,
okay,

285
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:34,550
if we can create a mechanism where we
just start accepting utility bills and

286
00:17:34,551 --> 00:17:37,700
make it easier compared to
what they're doing right now.

287
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,650
When you started behavior change,

288
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,220
12,700 banks in Pakistan,

289
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
9,080 ms where people never use ADM for
repayment bills or do you can 95% of you

290
00:17:50,351 --> 00:17:53,520
was just for cash withdrawals.
Does the typical, you know, psyche,

291
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:57,510
you can even make a interbank payment
through ATM when people don't,

292
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,090
they just use it for cash withdrawn.
That's likely go globally.

293
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:06,170
So we said Pakistan has now
let's say 90 million unique sims.

294
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,510
You know,
people would fall under 120 million,

295
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:17,550
same cards outstanding and
99% of those are prepared.

296
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,630
So it's not like postpaid account.

297
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:24,480
So here the most people actually buy
scratch cards or do a top up very

298
00:18:24,481 --> 00:18:28,260
frequently, you know, in the month
whenever they run out of same balance.

299
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,240
In order to accommodate that,

300
00:18:30,241 --> 00:18:35,241
the telcos had to set up a vast Asian
network where people could go and buy Sim

301
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:38,490
cards. It's like India, like Bangladesh
and most developing countries.

302
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:43,850
So the Telcos had set up agent network
multiple of what the bank branch network

303
00:18:44,251 --> 00:18:45,750
was.
So the Vision Board,

304
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:50,751
if you can create the change that 80
network into providing basic banking

305
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:54,780
service, like opening an account,
closing an account, making utility bill,

306
00:18:54,781 --> 00:18:59,070
making a transfer, then you would
actually create an alternative network,

307
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,230
which would be far more convenient for
the target market we were looking at,

308
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,510
because this network
is in the neighborhood,

309
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,740
it's open seven days a week is
open probably 14 hours a day.

310
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,140
The one that doesn't go to play golf,
you know,

311
00:19:13,141 --> 00:19:17,330
so it's something that's service oriented
because these agents are selling a

312
00:19:17,331 --> 00:19:20,580
whole bunch of other stuff
other than just a time.

313
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:26,690
So we basically started onboarding
telco agents for accepting utility bill

314
00:19:28,111 --> 00:19:32,580
payments. Now that was the behavior
change. When these customers go to a bank,

315
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,550
they see a bank brand disease,

316
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:38,940
you know the board of the bank and
they're comfortable that my payment when I

317
00:19:38,941 --> 00:19:39,361
make it,

318
00:19:39,361 --> 00:19:42,450
it's going to go through the drilling
company and my power won't be cut off.

319
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:44,730
So we're telling them,
hey guys would you know,

320
00:19:44,731 --> 00:19:49,140
go to the small shop the moment Bob
Store in your neighborhood and pay your

321
00:19:49,141 --> 00:19:53,030
utility bill and you're going to be okay.
And the guy says, hell no. You know,

322
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:57,330
if I can make this payment and this guy
shanks on tomorrow and my power gets cut

323
00:19:57,331 --> 00:20:00,480
off, who am I? Where's
my dress? Who do I go to?

324
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:05,940
So we tried to overcome that by
issuing a receipt by telling our bank.

325
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:10,200
So we said, listen, General Bank,
simply bank regulated entity.

326
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,520
If you power get cut off, you can take
the bank part of the central bank,

327
00:20:14,521 --> 00:20:18,480
the central bank will make you whole.
And the second policy we had what?

328
00:20:18,481 --> 00:20:23,070
Because the average payment was very
small and the aboriginal average payment

329
00:20:23,071 --> 00:20:27,690
for the common man was under 2000 rupees.
So our policy was never dispute.

330
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:32,250
Just make that payment.
So the power that never gets cut off,

331
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,070
even if you think the customer in
the wrong, just make that payment,

332
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:39,390
get that confidence level up.
So there's behavioral change takes place.

333
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:43,470
Two people start paying the utility
bills at the local mom and pop store as

334
00:20:43,471 --> 00:20:46,860
opposed to a bank. And that was, you know,

335
00:20:46,861 --> 00:20:49,780
the change we want to do it.
And a lot of campaigns,

336
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:54,460
we tried to literally beg
brand ambassadors standing
at this moment pop stores.

337
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:59,140
So you know, Trinity Bill,
it's interesting is here's
the receipt and you know,

338
00:20:59,141 --> 00:21:02,740
I want policy was no dispute,
just pay. And you know,

339
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,560
the time I left,
uh,

340
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:09,630
Tommy Bank was doing 10% of the
30 million bill pays three myths,

341
00:21:09,651 --> 00:21:14,190
3 million base would be bills were being
paid through us. And that customer,

342
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:18,970
Sally's for confidence of actually new
going to a woman pop store and bring a

343
00:21:18,971 --> 00:21:22,840
banking transaction started.
So that was the initial step.

344
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:27,010
The second step we said, you know,
it was an annual, you when you,

345
00:21:27,011 --> 00:21:31,360
if you're a startup, you make great
plans and many go to the ground.

346
00:21:31,361 --> 00:21:33,550
You sometimes find out that
those plans are, you know,

347
00:21:33,551 --> 00:21:36,490
are in the base of a basket
because you call it drunk,

348
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,470
but you have to figure out a way to pivot.

349
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:42,370
So we thought our biggest product was
going to be international remittance.

350
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:47,740
Pakistan gets $17 billion a year
from workers in the Middle East,

351
00:21:47,741 --> 00:21:52,000
in the UK and in the u s and we said,
you know,

352
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:57,190
bank branches, 12,700 closed on
a Sunday, half day on Saturday,

353
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:59,470
close long period on Friday for prayers.

354
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:03,910
We would be able to use
our agents across Pakistan,

355
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:07,240
60,000 agents and be able
to do this payment out.

356
00:22:07,241 --> 00:22:11,770
And then therefore the large payment
provider that flood to come to us because

357
00:22:11,771 --> 00:22:13,180
we would have said great distribution.

358
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:19,180
Well the only thing we miscalculated was
the average limiters size is $40,000.

359
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:20,530
Sorry,
40,000 rupees.

360
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:25,240
And the small agent doesn't have liquidity
to pay out five of these moments in a

361
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,180
day.
And all you need is if you,

362
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:32,140
if a Pakistan is go to ATM is not
working it's yard, no problem.

363
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:36,580
But if you go to withdraw cash from a
brother's Magni agent and there's no cash,

364
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:39,700
they said, oh, this guy's a fraud.
And the toll conference level,

365
00:22:39,701 --> 00:22:44,050
you've built up changes. So our
international image, this product failed.

366
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,510
But in the whole learning process,

367
00:22:46,511 --> 00:22:49,660
we are necessarily that there's a
huge component of domestic limiters,

368
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:54,760
$15 billion that paid domestically
in Pakistan and has gone through.

369
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,950
The way the money's transferred is
through some nickel hawala Hornby,

370
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,130
which is informal
payments through you know,

371
00:23:00,131 --> 00:23:03,510
money agents or to the
post office or you know,

372
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,400
people were into your home down and
you just give them the guys too.

373
00:23:06,401 --> 00:23:08,230
They give it to, you know,
your family back home.

374
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:13,120
And we said let's try domestic limiters
and domestic limiters with a phenomenal

375
00:23:13,121 --> 00:23:15,850
success. And as I said,
in our regional plan,

376
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:19,420
there was no domestic limiters
as a product. But that's when we,

377
00:23:19,421 --> 00:23:24,421
you start pivoting to when you were
original plan fails week and that's what

378
00:23:24,491 --> 00:23:29,380
actually achieved the biggest behavior
change and the industry we created that

379
00:23:29,381 --> 00:23:31,360
instead of going to informal channels,

380
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:35,950
you would go to an easy pesa agent
and say, I want to transfer money.

381
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,320
And he will say,
who do you want to transfer to?

382
00:23:38,321 --> 00:23:43,321
And in Pakistan there's a universal
identifier called a computerized national

383
00:23:43,361 --> 00:23:47,550
identity card. So it's a 16 digit
number. Everybody has, you know,

384
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,790
you just got can't live without anyone.
We didn't do anything,

385
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,550
so I would promise jobs
transferring money to you.

386
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:57,560
I would show them my CAC card. I would
give them yours, NFC card number.

387
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,900
If you're in a cell phone,
I'll give you a cell phone number.

388
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,550
I'd give my cell phone number and then
the agent would hand over his feature

389
00:24:04,551 --> 00:24:07,040
phone. Because remember you're
working on SMS at that time,

390
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:12,640
smart phones hadn't come in and he
would ask you to put in a pin number six

391
00:24:13,641 --> 00:24:17,000
digit. Now incidentally, in
90% of the spinning numbers
were one, two, three, four,

392
00:24:17,001 --> 00:24:19,770
five, six but ideally,
how we all came back

393
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:26,470
and within three minutes that money
was available at 60,000 agents and the

394
00:24:27,051 --> 00:24:29,780
beneficiary would go to the agent and say,
I have the money come.

395
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:32,090
And he would say, okay, show me your CIC.

396
00:24:32,091 --> 00:24:35,030
And they will physical should
have crs and say, okay.

397
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:37,760
They would give him the phone and say,
put in your pin.

398
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:42,220
But obviously if one two three four
five six for bill and the money would be

399
00:24:42,221 --> 00:24:45,260
drawn to,
it was a huge change from wedding,

400
00:24:45,261 --> 00:24:49,130
from the post office or informal services
and it was phenomenally successful.

401
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,070
So we got to the second stage,
you know,

402
00:24:52,071 --> 00:24:56,180
of what was getting people not get to
a comfort level after utility bills,

403
00:24:56,181 --> 00:24:59,220
just start making domestic remittances.
Uh,

404
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:03,440
the problem was that we went to the agent,
the agent said,

405
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,240
I'm not going to do this.
You know,

406
00:25:05,241 --> 00:25:09,620
I make a hundred percent margin on the
things I sell. This thing takes time.

407
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:14,000
You want me to add, you know, at
least 40 characters. But Damn,

408
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,020
I'm done with the trust zone.

409
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:18,650
We're going to add the CDIC number
from myself since I see number for you.

410
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:23,360
Just extend, there's 32 digits. I'm
going to add a 16 digit pin, 38 digits.

411
00:25:23,361 --> 00:25:26,540
It's gonna take time.
So they extracted the pound of flesh.

412
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:29,870
Then for every dollar we made,
they took 70 cents.

413
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:35,570
That's the price we paid for getting the
agent that worked to absorb or accept

414
00:25:35,571 --> 00:25:37,500
that as banging with miss 30 cents.

415
00:25:37,501 --> 00:25:41,570
We're left with the split between
the Telcor Tylenol and Tommy Bank.

416
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:47,080
So we had to then look at doing huge
volumes to be able to make money.

417
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:51,380
But the agents were very happy because
initially they were reluctant but then

418
00:25:51,381 --> 00:25:53,110
the style signing up.
But,

419
00:25:53,111 --> 00:25:56,810
but the end state was mobile wallet
because we are still learning to Bradley's

420
00:25:56,811 --> 00:26:00,260
bagging because we've got physical
interaction. You have to go to an agent.

421
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,730
It's like when I talked to him,

422
00:26:01,731 --> 00:26:06,710
you know I see an ad in the paper which
says Xyz Bank has opened a digital

423
00:26:06,711 --> 00:26:10,640
branch. You can walk into the branch
and there's no human intervention.

424
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,870
And I said to myself,

425
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:15,530
why in the hell would I want to get in
my car who travel for five minute miles

426
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,850
and then go to the branch and say,
wow, digital branch, you know,

427
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:22,010
this is the smart phone
is my digital branch.

428
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,990
I should be able to transact everything.

429
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:28,520
Boys sitting in my bed bed watching
season three of game of Thrones.

430
00:26:28,521 --> 00:26:32,090
And you know, the latest episode
and do my transactions. So you know,

431
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:35,380
it's just mind boggling for me
in or this digital brand content,

432
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,150
no human in dementia. Maybe it's you
know, busy street next to your office.

433
00:26:38,151 --> 00:26:41,570
But why would I even want to walk
any way to do my transactions?

434
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:43,740
So our next dog,

435
00:26:43,741 --> 00:26:48,741
it was creating mobile wallets that if
we could create mobile wallets instead of

436
00:26:49,051 --> 00:26:54,051
just physical activity and if the
customer was able to populate the mobile

437
00:26:54,841 --> 00:26:59,790
wallet, then you know, person to person
transactions, utility bill payments,

438
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:03,060
person to business transactions,
gtpb government,

439
00:27:03,061 --> 00:27:04,770
the person projections would take place.

440
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:07,980
And the three point 3 trillion
repeats floating in the system.

441
00:27:07,981 --> 00:27:12,981
We start coming into the magnet system
and we would have a secondary revenue

442
00:27:13,651 --> 00:27:16,940
stream, but we would have some
float on these mobile wallets.

443
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:18,540
Was it the transaction fee?

444
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:24,570
So initially we had a hurdle or how to
open these bank accounts because the

445
00:27:24,571 --> 00:27:29,571
central bank required a physical face to
face to open a bank account for Kyc and

446
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:32,310
anti money laundering.
Barbara says that to know your customer,

447
00:27:32,311 --> 00:27:36,390
you've got to see them.
Now that's a difficult call.

448
00:27:36,391 --> 00:27:40,380
That means I either the customer would
have to go to my branch and my brand and

449
00:27:40,381 --> 00:27:45,381
my network of agents would not be able
to open or they would have to take a

450
00:27:45,781 --> 00:27:50,140
photograph of the customer photograph
of the CIC with men, the deck,

451
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:54,600
the feature phone wouldn't work because
of pixel quality was too poor and the

452
00:27:54,601 --> 00:27:57,480
agent would have to have a smartphone
and who would fund that smartphone?

453
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:02,870
So our advantage of having a
large network Carney got me know,

454
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:08,480
uh, under leveraged as a consequence
of this requirement. But at zero,

455
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:11,550
sometimes things happen in the industry,
which don't happen because of view,

456
00:28:11,551 --> 00:28:12,780
but you get to benefit from.

457
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:18,410
So the Ministry of Interior decided that
every person with a cell phone had to

458
00:28:18,871 --> 00:28:22,680
be biometrically verified because there
were a lot of activities taking place.

459
00:28:22,681 --> 00:28:26,520
Sometime kidnapping, some time,
terrorist activity from cell force,

460
00:28:26,521 --> 00:28:27,430
they could learn defy.

461
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:32,550
So if I give myself my
identity card at the time,

462
00:28:32,551 --> 00:28:36,270
I'm making a transaction
to us, you know, uh,

463
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:40,410
Bradley's bagging the agent that brings
bang agent would take my Sinesi card and

464
00:28:40,411 --> 00:28:42,330
have five Muslims issue,
which I didn't know about it.

465
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:47,220
So the Pakistan Telecom Authority first
came up with a way that if you put in

466
00:28:47,221 --> 00:28:49,080
your senior as the card number,

467
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:51,660
you find out how many scenes
have been issued in your names.

468
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:56,010
And I didn't mind at 15 sims and I knew
that only three of those were mine and

469
00:28:56,011 --> 00:28:56,940
the rest.
But you know,

470
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:02,400
people using my energy for creating
a Sim card, you know, account,

471
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:07,050
uh, were Delco. They were paying
them on time, but above my same,

472
00:29:07,051 --> 00:29:08,700
and if tomorrow something happened,
you know,

473
00:29:08,701 --> 00:29:13,050
the agencies or I would be
responsible. So first, you know,

474
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:16,080
this whole tage took place
of political Simms went away,

475
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:18,930
but they still said is not working.

476
00:29:18,931 --> 00:29:22,830
So they said every sim has to
be biometrically verified too.

477
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,810
So if you hold the phone,

478
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:29,730
you would have to go into an agent
and be biomedically verified,

479
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,610
which would be verified by the
national entity. Based we have,

480
00:29:32,611 --> 00:29:35,850
which is called Nada.
And then your son would become active.

481
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,990
And if you wanted a same
immediately you couldn't get one.

482
00:29:39,991 --> 00:29:41,070
You'd have to get biometric,

483
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,290
you'd have to do the official address
and it'll be delivered to your home.

484
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:50,330
That took away like 35 million seems from
the telephone market in me, you know,

485
00:29:50,331 --> 00:29:52,000
the period of time in the Sim to place.

486
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:56,200
But then we had a very strong case and we
went to the central bank and said, Hey,

487
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:01,570
this sim is biometrically
verified by the central database.

488
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,090
Why am I required to see a customer?

489
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:09,390
Let's create bank accounts in line with
transactions and know your customer

490
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:13,180
risk. So let's say we have
some nick on 11 zero account.

491
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:17,320
This level zero gown says
you can do 50,000 rupees.

492
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:20,710
Every thousand rupees is $50
of transactions in a month.

493
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:23,670
That's good for 90% of Pakistanis.

494
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:28,690
Given the per capita income we have send
me back the loudest and the industry to

495
00:30:28,691 --> 00:30:30,700
do a remote account opening.

496
00:30:30,701 --> 00:30:34,240
So all you ever do is to send
an SMS to four of the banks,

497
00:30:34,241 --> 00:30:37,900
which are connected with telcos. And you
can open a wealth account. The store,

498
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,110
the first thing that came about
was the one minute account,

499
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,690
which actually doesn't exist in
many countries, including here.

500
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:47,500
You have to physically go into a
bank to open an account. In Pakistan,

501
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,980
you can open a level zero count
remotely under one minute.

502
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:56,560
So this hurdle of opening a mobile
account went away with dispute regulation.

503
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:01,410
And right now there are 27 million
mobile accounts in Pakistan over a three

504
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:05,740
period as opposed to the
2030 2 million bank accounts.

505
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:10,920
There's 1947 so branchless banking or
technology can actually make huge impact,

506
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:15,070
you know, when used properly and
it can change behavior of people.

507
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:20,080
So obviously nothing is easy.
So we have 27 million,

508
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:24,700
23 million mobile accounts.
But the next question you would ask me is,

509
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:26,800
that's great.
How many are active?

510
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:31,660
Because opening an account is easy
because I ran a sales campaign where the

511
00:31:31,661 --> 00:31:34,720
agent gets paid for every mobile
account and he has, you know,

512
00:31:34,721 --> 00:31:37,360
his grandmother and his dog
opening an account, you know,

513
00:31:37,361 --> 00:31:40,780
just because he wants to get to that
target will be going to pay him to opening

514
00:31:40,781 --> 00:31:41,614
a mobile account.

515
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:47,370
But less than 25% are active and active
is generally defined as one transaction

516
00:31:48,881 --> 00:31:51,700
in 30 days. That's the GSM made, you know,

517
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:54,430
definition of a mobile
account being active.

518
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:00,720
So we have yet to create the ecosystem
to have the customer can leave money in

519
00:32:02,411 --> 00:32:07,411
their mobile account so that this becomes
a source of revenue for the brothers

520
00:32:07,901 --> 00:32:12,220
bagging players. Because until
you get to a stage where I can,

521
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:16,420
so I was giving a mangrove getting great
tangent. I was giving a speech about,

522
00:32:16,421 --> 00:32:17,140
you know,

523
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:21,550
what I call digital Pakistan and I said
three things need to happen and if we do

524
00:32:21,551 --> 00:32:23,530
that, you know, will
get exponential growth.

525
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:27,340
The source was the one minute account
and that's actually taken place.

526
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:30,490
The second was the six orange purchase.

527
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:35,080
I should be able to buy six oranges
with digital cash as opposed to cash.

528
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:38,140
So if I'm in going to inbox then
you have a lot of hawkers you know,

529
00:32:38,141 --> 00:32:41,200
people with just small is if
I'm being a one done a butch,

530
00:32:41,201 --> 00:32:42,410
is it a paying him cash?

531
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:46,670
I should be able to pay with
digital cash and that acceptance,

532
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:49,900
a dig and players that you know that
merchant acquisition as in taking places

533
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:54,650
the end and when it does Sunday you'd
see a very high level of activity in

534
00:32:54,651 --> 00:32:58,790
mobile account. And the third thing was
the five click onboarding that you know,

535
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:02,060
if you're sitting in a religion you
wanted to become an ecommerce margin,

536
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,800
should be able to do in five clicks,

537
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:08,060
be able to set up the photograph of the
product, set up your payment mechanism,

538
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,660
set up your logistic mechanism and the
fifth grade you should become a motion.

539
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:16,580
Obviously that needs three g and four g
coverage, which is happening in Pakistan.

540
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:19,250
So those things, when you have
those kinds of things happening,

541
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:23,930
suddenly you see digital transactions
taking place. So that was the challenge.

542
00:33:23,931 --> 00:33:27,350
And I think we are halfway there.
So we've got the mobile accounts open.

543
00:33:27,351 --> 00:33:31,680
Now we have to make them active
startup investor.

544
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:37,160
What is your view on the current
technology and entrepreneurial scene in

545
00:33:37,161 --> 00:33:40,040
Pakistan?
So Pakistan,

546
00:33:40,041 --> 00:33:43,230
remember the country of 200
million people, you know,

547
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:46,490
that's a lot of European companies
combine and you won't get to 200 million

548
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:51,350
people. But a lot of, you know, the
Lens you see Pakistan from here is,

549
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:55,550
you know, there's blood in the street,
there's bomb blast, there's, you know,

550
00:33:55,551 --> 00:33:57,890
or the prime minister they
remove for corruption.

551
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:01,650
So negative news galleries easily.
And I've been trying,

552
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:06,530
I've been here what two days and I'd
met was turning 12 people already loaded

553
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,550
them vcs just talking about what's
happening in Pakistan because there's a

554
00:34:10,551 --> 00:34:13,730
counter narrative towards
run by CNN and Fox, you know,

555
00:34:13,731 --> 00:34:17,540
a lot of positive things happening.
So what's happened in last six,

556
00:34:17,541 --> 00:34:20,990
seven years in Pakistan is an
emerging middle class, for example,

557
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,800
that 30 million people in the emerging
middle cloud with purchasing power

558
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:29,330
because the inflation rate has been around
for four and a half percent salaries.

559
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:33,290
And growth will company growth rate has
been around eight to 10% so people has

560
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:37,310
been plummeting getting incremental income
and now you have 30 million people in

561
00:34:37,311 --> 00:34:39,800
one country which have purchasing power.

562
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,850
Right now there are 45 million
smartphones in Pakistan,

563
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:49,150
which is expected to go up to 80 million
by 2020 so remember the smartphone is,

564
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:51,770
you know, calling in, you
guys know this better than me.

565
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:56,440
Calling is just the 1% of a feature of
the smartphone is the biggest thing I

566
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:56,781
mentioned.

567
00:34:56,781 --> 00:35:01,610
I see this happen in our lifetime and
it's going to revolutionize many things.

568
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:06,140
If you have a smartphone I can do,
he helps with you.

569
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:09,950
I can do education with you,
I can do he and genuine with you.

570
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:13,300
I can do if an financial services within
a doc Watson of these initiatives where

571
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:18,450
you basically the world changes when you
have a smartphone by 2020 Pakistan is

572
00:35:18,861 --> 00:35:21,260
going to get 90% GSMs coverage,

573
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:25,430
three g and four g all over Pakistan,
just Sunday ruler.

574
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:30,170
Pakistan gets collected
with urban Pakistan and with
purchasing power increasing,

575
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:35,120
you've got a whole bunch of people who
can now be no box both ways they can buy

576
00:35:35,121 --> 00:35:38,550
things with the previous didn't have
access to or I have access to them.

577
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,820
I can run remote education program,
I can do,

578
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:46,380
he held consultations at clinics which
are better. Doctor is President Karachi,

579
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:50,610
but I'm in a remote distant
part of Pakistan and I can
do diagnostics and then I

580
00:35:50,611 --> 00:35:53,820
can use the payments to pay
the fee immediately happening.

581
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:58,890
And again use my iPharmacy who sent
the medicines out to those people.

582
00:35:58,891 --> 00:36:03,360
So Pakistan, I'm getting connected and
this is what I'm dong the vcs over here,

583
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:08,630
that he has a country which is staffed
for seed capital that two PE firms and

584
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:13,960
three vcs in Pakistan and the largest
angel investor in Pakistan, which is,

585
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:17,770
and I'm far from a high net
worth as far as Pakistan is,

586
00:36:17,771 --> 00:36:18,950
which family is a concern?

587
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:23,760
We just sitting on half a billion of
cash liquidity, half a billion dollars.

588
00:36:23,761 --> 00:36:28,050
Okay. And if I'm the largest investor is
a travesty because these guys, you know,

589
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:29,400
can invest a lot more.

590
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,010
But I viewed this major opportunity
because I think Pakistan is grossly

591
00:36:35,011 --> 00:36:37,740
undervalued with all these
things I'm talking about.

592
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:41,820
This big consumer vive is going to take
place and the valuation that will appear

593
00:36:41,821 --> 00:36:42,690
time go up,

594
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:47,310
the vcs and bugs outside Pakistan are
going to recognize Pakistan is a country

595
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,760
where they ought to come and invest once
they get over the Pakistan risk hurdle.

596
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:54,360
Okay. And then, you know
what valuations we have now,

597
00:36:54,361 --> 00:36:58,830
we're going to exponentially increase
and people who invest now are going to be

598
00:36:58,831 --> 00:37:00,060
able to write that benefit,

599
00:37:00,061 --> 00:37:04,340
detecting the initial risk and people
will get rewarded for being in Pakistan at

600
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:05,183
the right time.

601
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,140
Steve Question,

602
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:14,530
a question is that whether the regulatory
environment in Pakistan poses a huge

603
00:37:15,561 --> 00:37:19,220
challenge to,
to the startups and what can,

604
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,290
what is changing and uh,

605
00:37:21,291 --> 00:37:25,200
what can the startups do
to not fall into the dye?

606
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:30,130
So, you know, there's good news and
bad news. The good news. For example,

607
00:37:30,131 --> 00:37:33,010
if people are starting and
microfinance institution,

608
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:37,200
Pakistan's regulatory environment is
recognized by the economic intermittent

609
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:41,260
unit as number three in the world.
So that's very sorted out.

610
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:45,360
But if you're not in a microfinance world,

611
00:37:45,361 --> 00:37:50,361
then it's a challenge because the laws
are geared for the old economy is they're

612
00:37:52,451 --> 00:37:56,470
not geared for the new economy. So by
like if you look at neighboring India,

613
00:37:56,471 --> 00:38:00,340
they have started India where they've
taken five or six different things and

614
00:38:00,341 --> 00:38:02,050
said we've got to change these laws.

615
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,880
If you're going to make an entrepreneurial
culture happen in India, Pakistan,

616
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:10,480
recognize this, those things. For
example, if I want to register my company,

617
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:13,160
I ought to be able to do
it online and pain this,

618
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,940
then they should be a separate window.
So that window exists,

619
00:38:15,941 --> 00:38:19,390
but it's not very effective.
Right now. If I'm investing,

620
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,610
I should be able to do a
down round with Pakistan.

621
00:38:21,611 --> 00:38:22,950
Lord doesn't currently allowed.

622
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:27,160
I should be able to give employee options
that Pakistan Lord doesn't curl be

623
00:38:27,161 --> 00:38:31,390
recognizes. So we've identified all
the issues working with the security,

624
00:38:31,391 --> 00:38:34,660
the Gates Exchange Commission,
working with the tax regime.

625
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:39,070
Now to provide shelter for both invested
in investees because you don't want to

626
00:38:39,071 --> 00:38:40,600
have a lot of,
you know,

627
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:45,550
off that fed and you want to make
that invested. Actually, you know,

628
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:48,310
some prediction for that money
that gets written off initially.

629
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:53,210
So we are getting there in our day yet.
Uh, but it's recognized by the government.

630
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:57,100
Now that Pakistan has a largest
youth cohort in the world,

631
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:02,970
75% of people that are under 35 50% of
people are under 25 as these young people

632
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:04,924
graduate,

633
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:09,490
there's no way our current economy
can absorb them to regular employment.

634
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:14,430
So they hire has to be entrepreneurship
in order to make that entrepreneurship

635
00:39:14,431 --> 00:39:18,940
is, it can be a dividend or it can be a
bomb because if you don't have employment

636
00:39:18,941 --> 00:39:23,170
for the youth coming out, then they'll
get into what I call reverse ATM.

637
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:26,730
So when he's at a traffic light, as they
can have your phone, can I be a wallet?

638
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:29,800
Can I have anything else that would be
full? There'll be withdrawing from you.

639
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,890
None voluntarily. Okay. Because
you've got to give them employment.

640
00:39:32,891 --> 00:39:35,110
It has to be means for
them to sustain themselves.

641
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:38,650
So that's why the diamond
in the private sector.

642
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:41,680
And that's why I have so much passion
for depression because I think that's the

643
00:39:41,681 --> 00:39:45,970
future because Pakistan is such a young
population and I've worked with young

644
00:39:45,971 --> 00:39:50,380
people and they have far more brilliant
ideas I can even think of and the need

645
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,280
if you know, environment where people
can believe in them, mentor them,

646
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:57,880
help them grow and provide capital.
But I'm just one person.

647
00:39:57,881 --> 00:40:02,170
So maybe we need to have a whole slew
of people and support system from the

648
00:40:02,171 --> 00:40:04,720
government that makes this a much,

649
00:40:04,721 --> 00:40:08,800
much bigger player on a grander scale.
And we're getting there,

650
00:40:08,801 --> 00:40:13,720
but we're not there yet. So a followup
question on that note, uh, how,

651
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:16,950
what role are detective
incubators playing? And uh,

652
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,280
if you can name a few which
are playing actoral in,

653
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:22,750
so that 34 incubators,

654
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:27,010
accelerators and Pakistan and I would
say probably three years ago they were

655
00:40:27,011 --> 00:40:27,844
five.

656
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:32,880
So there's a mushrooming and understanding
that incubators and accelerators can

657
00:40:32,951 --> 00:40:36,820
play a role. Uh, there's plan x, you know,

658
00:40:36,821 --> 00:40:41,020
plan nine Nestio my incubate or Dell XC.
You know,

659
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:45,310
universities have incubators
as well, but the view, right,

660
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:49,930
the good news and bad news. Again,
the good news is that you know,

661
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:54,340
entrepreneurs who want to go into an
accelerator incubator program now are able

662
00:40:54,341 --> 00:40:57,520
to get mentorships. They will,
I will to get coworking space.

663
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:02,010
The bad news is there's only one
accelerator that actually pays you,

664
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:07,160
you know our values you and gives you
money and once you graduate they're not

665
00:41:07,751 --> 00:41:10,530
enough. Seed funds are, you
know, available over there.

666
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:14,980
Vcs that when you're graduating and your
initial capital is burned up to give

667
00:41:14,981 --> 00:41:15,814
you money.

668
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:20,020
So the risk we run sometimes is that
you're going to have default rates far

669
00:41:20,021 --> 00:41:25,021
higher than the natural 95% default grid
because there's not enough capital once

670
00:41:25,721 --> 00:41:26,554
you graduate.

671
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:30,400
And that's one of the things that I've
spending at least a bulk of my time on,

672
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,840
is getting people.

673
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:36,710
So the seed and vcs at this or when
people graduate have a great idea,

674
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:38,720
they don't die because of lack of capital.

675
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,720
They are to die because it's
an idea that can be scaled,

676
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:46,500
not because they didn't know capital and
great ideas. Just, you know, finish it off

677
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,750
for maybe one last question.

678
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:56,163
Mesmerized.

679
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:00,913
There you go.

680
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:06,160
How long do you think it would take
for beavers to change as far as like

681
00:42:06,161 --> 00:42:10,390
actually using digital while I
didn't do digital John's actions, uh,

682
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:13,210
orange, uh, thing that
you were talking about.

683
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:17,130
What are the constraints of the six audit?
If you know the banking business,

684
00:42:17,131 --> 00:42:21,540
then there's something called merchant
acquiring that if you use your credit

685
00:42:21,541 --> 00:42:25,530
card or a debit card at a merchant is
the point of sale machine pos machine

686
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:30,240
where he was just stripes your card
and you know, the payment gets made.

687
00:42:30,241 --> 00:42:33,660
It takes money from your credit card
and you know, visit to the supplier.

688
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:38,970
So the constraint Pakistan was the deck
costumers that Boston machine costs

689
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,880
about, you know, that's it. $30 $35.

690
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:46,290
And if I want to go to a real small shop,
here's the hook.

691
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,100
When tree is not equal to
the $30 risk I'm taking.

692
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:52,680
If I were to build 100,000 margins,

693
00:42:52,681 --> 00:42:56,910
I need $30 million of capital to put
a hundred thousand machines in please.

694
00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:01,320
But technology is a way of changing
things and now you have QR codes.

695
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:05,430
So look you are report now at
the merchant can be put in,

696
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:10,300
we are post machine is no longer required
and if the customer has a smart phone,

697
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:14,040
you just to text, you know, puts a skew
or a board and a payment can be made.

698
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:20,060
But the challenge is still remaining is
that why would typically the bid that

699
00:43:20,401 --> 00:43:24,510
the bank makes money is that there's
something going to much in Discount Rate

700
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:26,290
Mdr.
So if you started up a merger,

701
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,650
the merger is going to be
you one and a half percent,

702
00:43:28,651 --> 00:43:33,390
1% depending on where you are in the
word as fees for the facilitation that

703
00:43:33,391 --> 00:43:36,060
you're doing for increasing the sales.

704
00:43:36,061 --> 00:43:39,120
Because other than cash it wasn't going
to come in and use a credit card or a

705
00:43:39,121 --> 00:43:42,720
debit card.
But I'm mom and pop store to the Hawker.

706
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:46,970
Not going to give you 1% he says the
Dag, you very much. I liked Gash first.

707
00:43:46,971 --> 00:43:49,920
He would ask me not to take guys they
didn't want to charge me, you know,

708
00:43:49,921 --> 00:43:51,570
for not the gas doesn't work for me.

709
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:56,310
So this business model needs to be worked
out that if you create these margin

710
00:43:56,311 --> 00:44:01,311
that you make money from float as opposed
to transaction fee and the Pakistani

711
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:02,700
markers not there yet.

712
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:08,090
So while you are a board has
been established and people
like experimenting like

713
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:13,500
Fingernail, you know, but you are
bored or HBL or to the master God,

714
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:17,280
there's real inflection point is come
and they figured out the business model.

715
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,370
But I think we had Martin probably a
year to 18 months away before that gets

716
00:44:23,371 --> 00:44:26,790
correct. I'm going to dig a
shortage is about, so let's see.

717
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:32,220
Great. All right. So, uh, we have

718
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:36,070
one final question and maybe a minute
and a half for that pretty broad one.

719
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:41,420
What can companies like Google
and other bay area companies do,

720
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:45,390
um, in the, uh, in your opinion,
in the, uh, emerging markets?

721
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:50,630
I think, you know, one of the things, you
know, we would, a large players can do,

722
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:53,370
where do you honestly,
broad response to believe in Pakistan,

723
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,350
believe in the talent that exist
and use some of the, you know,

724
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:02,660
CSR and non CSR money in supporting that
and some of that you already mean done.

725
00:45:02,791 --> 00:45:06,340
Tall Dell Xc my accelerator
as a specialty for, we know,

726
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,570
data cloud funding from
Google for startups,

727
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:12,990
but they're got to a lot more of that,
take some investment dollars,

728
00:45:12,991 --> 00:45:16,680
put it in the infrastructure in Pakistan
because this is, like I said, you know,

729
00:45:16,681 --> 00:45:20,640
a touring a million people
country with a large youth cohort,

730
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:23,740
which will become Google
customers for life, you know, uh,

731
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:27,030
so there's lots of one investment
that needs to take place.

732
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,870
Then a lot more understanding the
precision of what the local dynamics are,

733
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:35,530
not just for Google, but for other people
in the bay area who want to access the,

734
00:45:35,531 --> 00:45:37,320
you know,
country of 200 million people.

735
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:44,850
[inaudible].
