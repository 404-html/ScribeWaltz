1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,010
Hi everyone. Thanks for joining
this authors at this lunch time. Uh,

2
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,700
I'm Yasmin Green. I, uh,

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,880
run research and development
for a group called Jigsaw,

4
00:00:16,881 --> 00:00:20,690
which is alphabet's technology incubator.
They can't geopolitics.

5
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:25,460
And I am delighted to welcome
Gwen de sacs to talk to us today.

6
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:29,060
Um, we're related, um,

7
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,330
where we've got to figure out like
the exact way to, to describe it,

8
00:00:32,331 --> 00:00:36,970
but Wendy's the sister of my,
uh, husband's cousin's wife, um,

9
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,430
there should be a short term,
short, short hand for that. Um,

10
00:00:40,431 --> 00:00:43,340
so if you guys are anything like me,

11
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:48,700
you feel some anxiety when you think
about the evolving nature of work and a

12
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:53,870
automation and globalization seem
like they're trends that, uh,

13
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,430
making more bleak,

14
00:00:55,431 --> 00:00:59,680
the prospects of us all being
gainfully employed in the future. Um,

15
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:04,730
and job security seems like
a kind of romantic notion,

16
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:07,760
um, from a past era. Um,

17
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,370
and yet we still want,
you know,

18
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:15,371
Yan Fridge for work that's a noshing
and stimulating and flexible.

19
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:20,480
And that brings us joy as
well as pays the bills. Um,

20
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:25,070
and, uh, sometimes we fantasize
about charting a new path, uh,

21
00:01:25,071 --> 00:01:28,730
but we're not even sure where we'd
start. Yeah. When it comes to that.

22
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:33,760
So when we love the advice of somebody
who has experience with every possible

23
00:01:35,571 --> 00:01:38,180
permutation of work life,
family,

24
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:43,660
and has reinvented themselves and captured
their insights in a book that will

25
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,080
help empower us and help us or thrive.

26
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,620
And that is Wendy Sachs.
That's the brilliance of Wendy.

27
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:56,290
And Wendy has a very diverse
and accomplished career, um,

28
00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:01,330
as a Emmy award winning producer
of a TV news on date night and BBC,

29
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:06,180
CNN, Fox and NBC, um,

30
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,960
is a critically acclaimed
author and journalist and has a,

31
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,810
um,
an eclectic career and politics in PR,

32
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:19,470
including holding the title of not
going to get this right. No, wait,

33
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,400
she can credit me Capitol Hill,
chief

34
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,750
press secretary,
Capitol Hill for a secretary.

35
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,230
I'm editor in chief and also,

36
00:02:30,231 --> 00:02:32,570
which I didn't get the full
one one from her about,

37
00:02:32,571 --> 00:02:37,310
but also a representative of
Barney the purple dinosaur.

38
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,420
So, um, anyway, without further ado, um,

39
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:44,240
it's a great joy to welcome Wendy
to share her insights with us today.

40
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,700
Yep.
Thanks so much.

41
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,990
Thank you for that warm introduction.
I'm,

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,820
I'm honored to be related to Yaz
even by some sort of cousin marriage.

43
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:00,130
I'm

44
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,180
talking about fearless.

45
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:05,260
I think that I don't know anyone who has
more fearless and Badass and this woman

46
00:03:05,261 --> 00:03:09,170
who's doing incredible
work here at Google. Um,

47
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:14,230
so I say that I've pivoted so much in
my career that I'm practically a wedding

48
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:19,450
and you know, not all of my pivots
have been intentional. I've been fired,

49
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:23,740
I've lost my job a couple
of times and you know,

50
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:28,060
because everything today has
an origin story, you know,
every brand, everything. Um,

51
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:33,150
my origin story of fearless
and free begins when I lost
my job in August of 2014

52
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:40,590
and um, I was working at a
advertising agency and you know,

53
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,330
sort of in mini tragedy to
lose your job and advertising.

54
00:03:43,331 --> 00:03:45,740
It happens all the time. Um, and they,

55
00:03:45,741 --> 00:03:49,210
they gave me some notice and I knew I
was going to be let go because I couldn't

56
00:03:49,211 --> 00:03:50,650
afford me anymore apparently.

57
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,440
And I started interviewing
all around New York City.

58
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:56,710
I started going to all of these, what I
would call the bright and shiny startups.

59
00:03:56,711 --> 00:03:59,140
I'm sure you work with many
of them here in New York.

60
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,970
And I was going around looking for
a job. My industry, media, you know,

61
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:06,520
had been completely disrupted by digital.

62
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,880
And I started really panicking because
at this point I'm over 40 and I'm in an

63
00:04:12,131 --> 00:04:16,510
industry that is, you know, overrun by
people now about 20 years younger than me.

64
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,350
And I thought if I don't get a job soon,
I'm not going to be relevant.

65
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,630
And of course, as we all
know, relevance is everything.

66
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:27,340
So I was interviewing at one shop and I
went in and of course it is, you know,

67
00:04:27,341 --> 00:04:31,930
a bearded millennial and that Flan all
like the total cliche sitting across from

68
00:04:31,931 --> 00:04:35,770
me. And I take out, start
taking out my resume,

69
00:04:35,771 --> 00:04:39,280
which is sort of lengthy at this,
at this point in my bio.

70
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,720
And I handed him right away. I knew
that there was trouble. Um, he said,

71
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,860
we don't take paper resumes around here,
we only want digital copies.

72
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:50,260
And I was like, oh, a feeling
embarrassed and shamed.

73
00:04:50,261 --> 00:04:54,550
And that clearly I was way too
old for this company. I shoved my,

74
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,690
my paper back in my bag and he opens up
his Mac book and he's looking over my

75
00:04:58,691 --> 00:05:02,500
resume and he sees that I
had worked on Capitol Hill.

76
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:05,050
I was a press secretary Oh,
while ago.

77
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,160
But I still kept it on my resume because
it was a position that I always felt

78
00:05:09,161 --> 00:05:10,660
very proud of.
You know,

79
00:05:10,661 --> 00:05:14,380
up until this point had given me
some gravitas and some credibility.

80
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:19,300
And like a lot I like to say is that
Capitol Hill was the Google of the gen x

81
00:05:19,301 --> 00:05:24,160
generation. It opened doors for us and
open big careers for many people. We all,

82
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:28,750
you know, many people I know started
there, went onto to big, big careers.

83
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:33,670
But here, you know that the man looking
at me sort of scoffed and said, you know,

84
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,700
around here we have good
relationships with the media.

85
00:05:36,701 --> 00:05:41,230
I wouldn't want you hanging up on any
reporters or anything. And I, you know,

86
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,980
completely startled by this. I
said, you know, jokingly, well,

87
00:05:44,981 --> 00:05:47,440
I'm not a character in
veep or the house of cards.

88
00:05:47,441 --> 00:05:49,270
I wasn't screaming at reporters,

89
00:05:49,271 --> 00:05:51,820
I was begging them to cover
my member of Congress.

90
00:05:51,821 --> 00:05:54,670
He was a freshman member from
accredited district in south Florida.

91
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,550
He didn't even laugh at any
of this. So after I, you know,

92
00:05:58,551 --> 00:06:00,260
started walking through the office,

93
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:05,120
holding onto my paper resume and
grabbing my coconut water and Kale chips.

94
00:06:05,121 --> 00:06:08,240
As I walked out,
I'm feeling sort of depressed.

95
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:12,680
I was walking down Fifth Avenue
and I thought to myself, you know,

96
00:06:12,681 --> 00:06:15,560
something's got to change.
Obviously I have, you know,

97
00:06:15,561 --> 00:06:19,400
I've done what I think has been, you
know, very interesting jobs in my career.

98
00:06:19,401 --> 00:06:23,510
I'm clearly qualified for these positions.
What am I doing wrong?

99
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,740
And I had this sort of epiphany and I
started looking towards silicon valley.

100
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:28,730
I was sort of always,
you know,

101
00:06:28,731 --> 00:06:31,250
obsessed with the tech world
the way that so many of us are.

102
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:36,290
And because that toll startup spirit
and tech world and Silicon Valley's

103
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:39,380
basically directing everything
we do today, as you know,

104
00:06:39,381 --> 00:06:44,381
better than anyone from how we shop to
how we get our news and our attainment,

105
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,580
how we target isis.
You know,

106
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:51,320
everything we do is coming
from the startup space,
silicon valley, the tech world.

107
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,580
So one of the,

108
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:56,690
one of the themes and one of the sort of
characteristics that sort of struck me

109
00:06:56,691 --> 00:06:57,441
at this time,

110
00:06:57,441 --> 00:07:01,100
and it was because I had seen this New
York magazine article about that whole

111
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:05,510
failure, failure fetish coming out of
Silicon Valley. And I thought, well,

112
00:07:05,511 --> 00:07:09,350
I understand failure. I've
failed a few times. Um,

113
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,000
but what is it about that whole failure
idea, that embracing of failure,

114
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:17,090
that's so, you know,
part of the DNA of the,

115
00:07:17,091 --> 00:07:21,800
of the tech world and why is it a badge
of honor for these boys and the hoodies

116
00:07:21,801 --> 00:07:23,840
who launched companies that blow up,

117
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,710
they're not going in climbing into
a hole and disappearing. No, I mean,

118
00:07:27,711 --> 00:07:28,521
from what I'm reading,

119
00:07:28,521 --> 00:07:32,690
they're getting rehired or they're
just pivoting on their business, right?

120
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:36,800
That the venture capitalists are investing
in the people and the talent behind

121
00:07:36,801 --> 00:07:40,980
the business, not necessarily the business
idea. And of course there's a, you know,

122
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:45,710
dozens of examples to point to. So I
just love that idea. And I thought,

123
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,530
what if women did that
in their own careers?

124
00:07:48,531 --> 00:07:53,531
What have women sort of own that concept
that we don't need to feel shamed if we

125
00:07:54,471 --> 00:07:56,780
lose a job?
And so many people do today,

126
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,740
what if we really sort of invested in
ourselves and leaned into our own skills

127
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:03,530
and realize we just need to pivot.
We need to iterate.

128
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,680
And what if we were okay
with that idea of failure?

129
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:10,370
So as I started sort of digging
into this concept of a failure,

130
00:08:10,371 --> 00:08:15,371
of course a cousin happy cousin to
failure is success and it Albert Einstein,

131
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:19,430
so many people have these great quotes
around failure. He says, you know,

132
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:23,300
failure is the pathway to
success. Something like
that. I'm paraphrasing that.

133
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,560
But you know, that's that idea. So I
started looking at confidence, right?

134
00:08:27,561 --> 00:08:32,120
So confidence is the foundation to,
to building anything,

135
00:08:32,121 --> 00:08:36,050
to taking risks. And it's all about
the risk taking. And of course,

136
00:08:36,051 --> 00:08:39,110
I'm sure you're all familiar with all
of the studies that show, you know,

137
00:08:39,111 --> 00:08:41,630
men are more willing to
take risks and women,

138
00:08:41,631 --> 00:08:44,900
we know men start more companies more.
It's startups in women.

139
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:46,250
They certainly get the financing,

140
00:08:46,251 --> 00:08:50,970
the venture capital backing that women
don't get, you know. So why is that? Um,

141
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,290
so as I started looking into some
of the research around confidence,

142
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,870
I was looking at Claire
Shipman and Katty Kay,

143
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,660
I don't know if anyone here is familiar
with their book, the Confidence Code,

144
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:04,980
which sort of became my Bible as I was
doing my own research on confidence and

145
00:09:04,981 --> 00:09:08,970
they found that there's this genetic
connection with confidence that there's

146
00:09:08,971 --> 00:09:10,010
actually,
you know,

147
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,830
there's a genetic component sort of like
you know who gets blue eyes or curly

148
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:18,440
hair and they did their own DNA testing
and they found very disappointing lay

149
00:09:18,441 --> 00:09:19,110
that they,

150
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:22,350
neither one of them carry that genetic
trade to actually create confidence.

151
00:09:22,351 --> 00:09:25,770
And of course this was incredibly
disheartening to them because you want to

152
00:09:25,771 --> 00:09:30,690
think that you are, you know,
genetically enabled to be confident.

153
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:34,650
But what they also found,
which of course is very empowering,

154
00:09:34,651 --> 00:09:36,630
is that we can build confidence.

155
00:09:36,631 --> 00:09:41,160
Confidence is a muscle like resilience
is a muscle that Sheryl Sandberg of

156
00:09:41,161 --> 00:09:44,760
course is recently talking about.
Confidence is also a muscle.

157
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:49,050
And the fastest way to become
confident is to take risks.

158
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:52,380
And women just chat generally
are more risk averse in,

159
00:09:52,381 --> 00:09:56,040
we're taught this at an early age,
we don't like to fail,

160
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,990
we don't like to get things wrong.

161
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,860
We don't like to take as many
chances in hysterics really early on.

162
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,570
So the more studies that I was uncovering
and looking at the writings of Carol

163
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:11,370
Dweck, who's a well known professor
and she wrote a book called Mindset,

164
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:16,700
she writes about that this starts at a
very early age with that whole idea of a

165
00:10:16,801 --> 00:10:19,260
growth mindset versus fixed mindset.

166
00:10:19,261 --> 00:10:24,261
The idea that we sort of only know what
we know is that fixed mindset that you

167
00:10:24,571 --> 00:10:27,840
know, you, you are good at
math and that is what you know,

168
00:10:27,841 --> 00:10:32,290
but you would not be good at perhaps art.
Um,

169
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,031
verse.

170
00:10:33,031 --> 00:10:36,450
That whole idea of a growth mindset that
you can develop your skills and you can

171
00:10:36,451 --> 00:10:39,990
turn into, you can sort of evolve
and you can iterate as you go. Well,

172
00:10:39,991 --> 00:10:41,400
this is really important,

173
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,210
not just in the parenting space
as it became recently adopted,

174
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:48,780
because there's that whole concept
that we're not supposed to tell her our

175
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:49,441
daughters at.

176
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:52,680
They're good at math because maybe
in fifth grade they're good at math,

177
00:10:52,681 --> 00:10:55,800
but by ninth grade when math gets
hard and they're not doing so well,

178
00:10:55,801 --> 00:10:59,250
they now take it personally and think,
I guess I'm just not so good at math.

179
00:10:59,251 --> 00:11:01,800
We're supposed to praise the journey.
So,

180
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:04,620
but this is also very true to ourselves.

181
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,030
If we can't accept the idea that we can
continue to evolve and grow while we're

182
00:11:09,031 --> 00:11:12,390
going to get stuck. So these
things were very interesting to me.

183
00:11:12,391 --> 00:11:16,890
This whole risk taking versus growth
mindset versus fixed mindset and how we

184
00:11:16,891 --> 00:11:19,680
think about ourselves and how you know,

185
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:22,830
our ability and our willingness
to really take risks.

186
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:27,810
But along with this whole confidence and
internal internalization of how we're

187
00:11:27,811 --> 00:11:30,870
feeling, it's also about
how we present to the world.

188
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,830
And so as I was writing this book,
the book is not a memoir,

189
00:11:34,831 --> 00:11:39,510
but it very much a personal journey for
me as I was exploring my own sort of,

190
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,790
you know, what was happening out
there in the workforce and how,

191
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:46,140
what I needed to change.
And it was also the election.

192
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,440
And so during the election of course
we saw how women are perceived.

193
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:56,020
Of course the person carrying the mantle
for all of us was Hillary Clinton.

194
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:01,420
And we saw that the way that she was
perceived to, you know, to the voters,

195
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:06,010
to the population, to the media was that
she came across as either too shrill,

196
00:12:06,011 --> 00:12:08,620
too on earth and authentic.
She wasn't warm enough.

197
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,340
She was judged to a different
standard. And there is this, you know,

198
00:12:12,341 --> 00:12:15,280
famous Jimmy Kimmel sketch that,
I don't know if any of you saw,

199
00:12:15,281 --> 00:12:19,420
but I write about in the book
and in this one sketch he sorted,

200
00:12:19,421 --> 00:12:22,930
this is like what they called
the mansplaning sketch. And she,

201
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:26,650
so Hillary's you standing behind a podium
and she's pretending that she's giving

202
00:12:26,651 --> 00:12:30,490
her stump speech and she starts out,
you know, a little bit loud. And He, Oh,

203
00:12:30,491 --> 00:12:33,910
you know, keep it down. Keep
it down. The voice, the voice,
it's a little too shrill,

204
00:12:33,911 --> 00:12:37,840
a little too loud. She drops it
down. You got to raise your voice.

205
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:41,740
You're sounding like a mouse up there.
And then she begins again and he's like,

206
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:44,980
you don't look for it. You got to
smile more. You've got to smile.

207
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:49,240
So she starts smiling. You look like a
Lakers, girls, what's with the smile?

208
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:53,080
You know, whatever she did and it went
on and on. And then he's like, you know,

209
00:12:53,081 --> 00:12:55,690
I can't put my finger on it.
I'm not sure. What is it?

210
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:59,620
What is it about you that's just
not right? I know you're not a man.

211
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:04,810
You're not a man. And that of course
was, you know, the ultimate, you know,

212
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:09,700
poking fun at exactly what was happening
and exactly how she was being perceived.

213
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,550
Um, and, and that of
course is the double bind.

214
00:13:12,551 --> 00:13:16,060
And I'm sure is everyone here
familiar with that double bind?

215
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:19,880
The women in leadership at the double
bind is the ultimate conundrum for women

216
00:13:19,881 --> 00:13:20,714
and leadership.

217
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:25,980
And that is that when women present
with more masculine characteristics that

218
00:13:26,141 --> 00:13:29,410
they are direct, are there, have a
loud voice or they come off, you know,

219
00:13:29,411 --> 00:13:33,120
very strong, they're not well
liked. There seem, you know,

220
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,600
people see them as abrasive or
they're bitches, they're not well,

221
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,710
they're not well liked.

222
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:43,390
But when women present with their
more feminine qualities that they are

223
00:13:43,391 --> 00:13:46,820
nurturing and it seemed to be warm,
engaging,

224
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:51,700
maybe their voice isn't so loud,
they're not thought to be strong leaders.

225
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,270
So that's the conundrum,
right? That is the double bind.

226
00:13:55,271 --> 00:13:58,720
And then of course we saw that
play out during the campaign.

227
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,990
Not to say that Hillary Clinton didn't
have, you know, other issues going on,

228
00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:05,440
but that was a big part of
it. So all of this, you know,

229
00:14:05,441 --> 00:14:08,440
is happening as I'm writing the book, the
campaign, I'm watching what's happening.

230
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,460
And by the way, you know, just to
compare and contrast, when you saw it,

231
00:14:12,461 --> 00:14:15,700
you knew this was not just a Democrat,
republican thing. You see Bernie Sanders,

232
00:14:15,701 --> 00:14:20,080
who's, you know, pounding the podium and
finger thrusting and he's messy and he's,

233
00:14:20,081 --> 00:14:24,550
you know, disheveled and he's loud
and he's angry. And people love that.

234
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,690
Right? People love that about Bernie.
There was no, you're too loud.

235
00:14:28,691 --> 00:14:32,230
You're too obnoxious. Your hair's
a mess. Fix your tie, you know,

236
00:14:32,231 --> 00:14:36,430
stop with the finger. No,
that was manly. It was alpha.

237
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:41,230
It was legitimate. It was authentic,
and people loved it. Women loved it.

238
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,800
So that's really, really, that
was very fascinating to me.

239
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,870
And I think at some level,

240
00:14:46,871 --> 00:14:50,500
I also had this sort of personal
association with all of this.

241
00:14:50,501 --> 00:14:55,010
Not that I'm anywhere near a Hillary
Clinton's level, um, or will be,

242
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:00,520
but I had been viewed in the workforce
at one particular job as being too

243
00:15:02,781 --> 00:15:03,614
abrasive.

244
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,420
I was told this in one of my job reviews
that I came across as a little bit too

245
00:15:08,421 --> 00:15:10,950
abrasive to tough.
Um,

246
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:16,030
what I thought was being direct other
people viewed and perceived as being the

247
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:19,430
word that's commonly associated
with women is abrasive.

248
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:24,680
And I was horrified. I was. So I felt so,

249
00:15:24,681 --> 00:15:29,450
um, I don't want to say ashamed,
but I felt so hurt actually.

250
00:15:29,451 --> 00:15:30,284
I mean,
I,

251
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,790
I didn't want people not to like me
because everyone wants to be liked.

252
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:39,740
And by the way, likability and the
workforce goes a really long way. Um,

253
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,140
so I didn't know what
to do about all of this.

254
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:46,400
And so at the same time that this was
all happening and I was feeling very sad

255
00:15:46,401 --> 00:15:48,650
about, you know, not being liked. Um,

256
00:15:48,651 --> 00:15:52,820
I wound up actually getting a new job and
I went to the advertising agency I had

257
00:15:52,821 --> 00:15:56,810
mentioned before and I started saying,
sorry a lot.

258
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:01,610
I was just dropping in. Sorry. Sorry.
Sorry. Where do I hang this report?

259
00:16:01,611 --> 00:16:05,660
Sorry. Opening the door. You know,
when I go into a room, sorry.

260
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:10,340
And I was adopting this, sorry, because
there was another colleague of mine who,

261
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,460
granted she was like blond in
puttied and dimpled and very sweet.

262
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,840
She would always say sorry.

263
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,740
And no one ever thought that she was a
bitch or that she was too direct or that

264
00:16:18,741 --> 00:16:20,330
she came across as abrasive.

265
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:25,510
So I thought I'm going to use this whole
sorry thing and it worked like a charm.

266
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:26,690
I'm telling you,

267
00:16:26,691 --> 00:16:31,670
I was with the like toughest
creative guys who are, you know,

268
00:16:31,671 --> 00:16:34,640
feeling all bold and, and
all, all that going on.

269
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:38,510
But no one thought I was being
too direct because I wasn't,

270
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,160
I had dialed it back.

271
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:44,960
And so interestingly at this time
at the agency where I was working,

272
00:16:44,961 --> 00:16:48,710
there was a Pantene commercial that came
out and I don't know if you remember,

273
00:16:48,711 --> 00:16:52,880
it was a few years ago and it got a lot
of recognition and it was a campaign

274
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:56,480
where they were showing it was for
Pantene and there were showing all these

275
00:16:56,481 --> 00:16:59,930
different circumstances
of women apologizing.

276
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:04,000
So in one scene you see a woman on
a subway and a man sits next hurt,

277
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:07,610
his legs are spread open and she's
doing this and she says, sorry.

278
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,820
And in another scene
you see a kitchen and,

279
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,340
and the woman is handing over a child,

280
00:17:13,341 --> 00:17:15,980
which looks like it's either to
her husband or partner or whoever.

281
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,910
As she handed the baby over, she
says, sorry, another instance,

282
00:17:19,911 --> 00:17:22,910
a woman in an office is opening up a door.

283
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,850
There's men sitting at the
table and she says, sorry.

284
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:30,050
And so it was a whole slew of Saris and
basically they were making fun of the

285
00:17:30,051 --> 00:17:32,480
fact that women are
apologizing all the time.

286
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:37,160
So now I'm feeling sorry for saying sorry.
And I quickly dropped my sorry.

287
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,550
And it was at the ad agency where I was
working at that they actually produce

288
00:17:40,551 --> 00:17:45,320
the ad. So it was just like total
sort of awakening of what's going on.

289
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,330
Um, and uh, during this time also,

290
00:17:47,331 --> 00:17:50,700
I'm sure you also heard of all of the
other shrinker words that people talk

291
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:52,950
about the justice and
the actually's and the,

292
00:17:52,951 --> 00:17:57,630
am I making sense and all the language
that really diminishes our power.

293
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,320
And Are you,
does anyone know Tammy Reese in this room?

294
00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:06,321
So Tammy Reese actually created a g
plugin that was going to be like these

295
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,320
spellcheck four, sorry. And
it got a lot of attention.

296
00:18:10,321 --> 00:18:13,290
I see some heads saying yes,
it got a lot of attention. And,

297
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:17,040
and I interviewed her for the book and
she talks about the fact that it wasn't

298
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,860
supposed to change the way
that we communicate entirely.

299
00:18:19,861 --> 00:18:22,950
Like saying you know like shame
on you for saying just, you know,

300
00:18:22,951 --> 00:18:26,580
because we think that sort of breezy
sometimes you want to say just in a

301
00:18:26,581 --> 00:18:27,930
sentence,
but her,

302
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:32,220
her feeling was she wanted to make women
aware of the language that they were

303
00:18:32,221 --> 00:18:36,960
using and how we are presenting to
the world because it is so incredibly

304
00:18:36,961 --> 00:18:38,460
important to how we present.

305
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:42,120
And so some of the suggestions that
when I started asking some experts like,

306
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,560
okay,
we use these Justin,

307
00:18:43,561 --> 00:18:47,730
the actually is because we don't want
to be seen as abrasive and to direct.

308
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,790
So we try to come across as a little,
a little softer,

309
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:55,250
but the suggestions are open in
your email, warm and in your email,

310
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:59,430
warm in the middle scrubbing.
He just actually is in my making sense.

311
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,970
And that's the smartest approach you do.
And you can do that in person too.

312
00:19:02,971 --> 00:19:04,320
When you walk into a meeting,

313
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:09,300
you can start with some small talk about
the weather or whatever and but then be

314
00:19:09,301 --> 00:19:13,980
direct, smile and warm, you're done like,

315
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:17,970
but there are no apologizing. And so
I thought that was really also very,

316
00:19:17,971 --> 00:19:18,691
very interesting.

317
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:23,400
What is it that women are doing that is
in an advertently effecting our power,

318
00:19:23,401 --> 00:19:28,260
diminishing our strength to the world.
So another theme that I also looked at,

319
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:32,930
um, when again looking towards Silicon
Valley for all of my answers, um,

320
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,940
I looked at that concept
of engineering serendipity.

321
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,470
Do you all know what that is?

322
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,710
I feel like this is a group that
engineering serendipity. So,

323
00:19:40,711 --> 00:19:45,010
so many of us think of serendipity
as a happy accident, right?

324
00:19:45,011 --> 00:19:48,420
She's good fortune somehow like
great things just happened.

325
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:52,050
But actually there is
strategy behind serendipity.

326
00:19:52,051 --> 00:19:54,270
We can make that magic happen.

327
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:58,800
And a few years ago at south by southwest,
it being a peak,

328
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,380
it actually became sort of
a theme of the conference.

329
00:20:01,381 --> 00:20:03,540
There was a bunch of sessions of,

330
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:08,541
with creative agencies and tech companies
all talking about this concept of

331
00:20:08,611 --> 00:20:10,080
engineering serendipity.

332
00:20:10,081 --> 00:20:15,060
We can create these amazing collisions
of creativity. And innovation. Um,

333
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:18,330
which to me was incredibly
eye opening. Like, oh,

334
00:20:18,331 --> 00:20:21,570
we can actually make these
things happen for us. Um,

335
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:26,220
so the one man in my book is a
guy named Mike and he's the only,

336
00:20:26,221 --> 00:20:28,320
he's the only dude in the book.
And um,

337
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:33,470
I call him the king of serendipity because
while we have worked together several

338
00:20:33,631 --> 00:20:33,871
times,

339
00:20:33,871 --> 00:20:37,950
so I've benefited from his own kingdom
of serendipity because he's hired me a

340
00:20:37,951 --> 00:20:38,784
few times.

341
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:42,720
He was always able to sort of maneuver
between a whole bunch of different things.

342
00:20:42,721 --> 00:20:46,710
He was working for Larry Ellison and
running some sort of startup company.

343
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:51,560
He also was writing screenplays. He's
also producing digital series. He,

344
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:55,390
he was able, and he started
out as a TV news journalist.

345
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:59,920
So he somehow was able to, you
know, zig zag between industries,

346
00:20:59,921 --> 00:21:04,450
make money, have three children and
to me like sort of live the dream.

347
00:21:04,451 --> 00:21:08,110
And I would look to him thinking,
how is he doing that? Well,

348
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:11,890
part of it I realized is that he is a guy.

349
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:16,120
So when he would invite me to go to, you
know, networking events, he'd say, Hey,

350
00:21:16,121 --> 00:21:19,770
you should come out for drinks. You know,
I'm meeting with this, you know, you know,

351
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:20,890
movie producer,

352
00:21:20,891 --> 00:21:24,040
he's in from La and we're talking
about this script that I just wrote.

353
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:27,670
I would say, you know, I got to catch
the train. I got to get home. And,

354
00:21:27,671 --> 00:21:30,760
but somehow he was able to
keep building his network,

355
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:35,620
keep expanding his boundaries,
and keep creating this magic for himself.

356
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,160
So when I was looking into this whole
concept of Engineering Serendipity,

357
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:42,370
I interviewed Mike and I said,
what is it? How did you do this?

358
00:21:42,371 --> 00:21:46,020
He actually had a formula for serendipity.
I couldn't believe it.

359
00:21:46,021 --> 00:21:49,600
He has a mathematical equation that I'm
not going to be able to remember right

360
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:52,990
now. It's in my book, but it's
about visibility, you know,

361
00:21:52,991 --> 00:21:55,630
sort of dividing by,
you know,

362
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,630
what you've done in the past
and where you're located in.

363
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,070
And it was like a whole formula to
creating this perfect magic for himself.

364
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:07,180
But what he was doing was something
that's actually been studied for many,

365
00:22:07,181 --> 00:22:07,871
many years.

366
00:22:07,871 --> 00:22:12,700
And it's about this idea that
you're opening boundaries
and as you are expanding

367
00:22:12,701 --> 00:22:15,610
your networks, you're creating
opportunities for yourself,

368
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,810
but you're also being seen.
You're also being visible in,

369
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,270
you're putting in the work, so it's
not just magically appearing for you.

370
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,180
You've actually done your homework,
you've started a project,

371
00:22:25,181 --> 00:22:28,600
you've done some research, you've,
you've, you know, created your side Gig.

372
00:22:28,601 --> 00:22:30,040
So you're doing something on the side.

373
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:33,400
So now you're actually sort of
getting there. You're, you're making,

374
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:37,240
you're taking the steps to get there and
now you're putting yourself in a place,

375
00:22:37,241 --> 00:22:40,960
whether it's a networking event or a
conference or some sort of meetup where

376
00:22:40,961 --> 00:22:42,370
you're meeting with the right people.

377
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:47,050
And then the key to all of it is that
you're seizing on the opportunity that

378
00:22:47,051 --> 00:22:48,250
you're ready for it.
You,

379
00:22:48,251 --> 00:22:53,251
you now have your eyes wide open and you
can see the opportunity and you seize

380
00:22:53,561 --> 00:22:56,350
the moment. You don't,
you're not held back by fear.

381
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:01,300
You're not held back by
feeling not confident. Um,
so I thought that was really,

382
00:23:01,301 --> 00:23:04,630
really fascinating. And by the way,
as I was exploring serendipity,

383
00:23:04,631 --> 00:23:07,840
I saw that it happens here at Google.
But you all must know about,

384
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:10,720
I mean this whole innovation
time off the 20% I don't know,

385
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,600
does anyone actually do
that? They take, okay,

386
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:18,690
that is brilliant and revolutionary and
that's another time where your company

387
00:23:19,391 --> 00:23:23,710
is saying to you, go explore,
go innovate, go be creative,

388
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,491
go take,

389
00:23:24,491 --> 00:23:28,960
have the head space to go
work on something because
we know that when you have

390
00:23:28,961 --> 00:23:33,130
the time and this sort
of mental space to do it,

391
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,620
great things are gonna happen.
And that is really,

392
00:23:35,621 --> 00:23:39,940
really similar to this whole notion of
serendipity and what has held a lot of

393
00:23:39,941 --> 00:23:43,660
women back. And I was actually
interviewing a guy who's
writing an entire book on

394
00:23:43,661 --> 00:23:44,530
Serendipity,

395
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:49,730
is he said that women don't
generally have the time to noodle.

396
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
We don't have the time to be creative.

397
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,960
When we're working a full time job and
we have a family and you're rushing to

398
00:23:56,961 --> 00:24:00,050
get home, pick up your child
from daycare or make a train,

399
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,270
you just don't have that time built in.

400
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:05,600
Whereas men just sort of
either create the time,

401
00:24:05,601 --> 00:24:09,560
aren't racing to get to the train or
relieve the babysitter from daycare or

402
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:13,100
their nanny this in the same
way and they have more time.

403
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:16,460
So I do think that there's
definitely sort of a gender divide,

404
00:24:16,461 --> 00:24:20,030
a bit of a gender gap in this area because
we tend to not have the time or not

405
00:24:20,031 --> 00:24:24,290
take it upon ourselves to
be able to engineer this,

406
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:27,350
this moment for ourselves.
A serendipity. Um,

407
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:30,980
the other issue that of
course I kept exploring,

408
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:35,210
which is part and parcel to everything in,
in the tech world today is networking,

409
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:39,500
right? So it's all about networking.
Everything we do today is networking.

410
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:45,150
You know, that does, that is, that is the
sort of foundation of how we connect. Um,

411
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,700
and it's all about the networks.

412
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,200
But one of the things that women
haven't really had until very recently,

413
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:55,040
our really strong female networks.
And I will tell you,

414
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,010
and I'm older than maybe a lot of
you are sitting here in the room,

415
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:02,370
but when I was coming up through
the ranks and I worked in media, um,

416
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:04,310
I had a lot of female bosses,

417
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:08,360
but I never felt as if I didn't feel
like it was an all out cat fight where we

418
00:25:08,361 --> 00:25:11,330
were like crawling over each other,
trying to like get to the top.

419
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:15,440
But I didn't feel like any of my bosses
or any of the women who I worked with,

420
00:25:15,441 --> 00:25:18,830
they were trying to lift me with them.
I didn't feel like they were raising me.

421
00:25:18,831 --> 00:25:21,950
I do feel like there was a smaller
piece of the pie at the top.

422
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:26,660
They wanted to hold onto it,
so they didn't sort of pull
me along in the process.

423
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:32,050
What I have really seen a huge change
in the past few years or the amount of

424
00:25:32,361 --> 00:25:36,350
female networks out there in all
different industries. Of course,

425
00:25:36,351 --> 00:25:38,060
you probably know about
the tech industry is,

426
00:25:38,061 --> 00:25:40,940
and there's so many here in New York and
there's so many in different, you know,

427
00:25:40,941 --> 00:25:43,790
from Nashville to Austin to San Francisco.

428
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,430
What I'm talking about a whole
bunch of different industries.

429
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:49,580
I have a friend who was actually,
she's an interior designer.

430
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:54,581
She was out and think Sun Valley a few
weekends ago with her female network of

431
00:25:54,771 --> 00:25:57,470
designers.
And of course they're using technology.

432
00:25:57,471 --> 00:26:02,450
They're using the whatsapp chats and all
of the in Facebook and different groups

433
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:06,980
to connect and to support each other.
This just didn't exist in the same way.

434
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:11,160
So I was, as I was really sort of
digging into female networks. Um,

435
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:16,240
of course I found the one that maybe some
of you know about tech lady Mafia Tech

436
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:19,610
Lady Mafia. So Amina sow, create
a tech lady mafia with a friend.

437
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:24,200
And the whole idea around, around
this network, not just, you know,

438
00:26:24,201 --> 00:26:26,390
let's connect and support each other.

439
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:29,300
But they actually have done
something really, really,

440
00:26:29,301 --> 00:26:33,560
I think unique and really empowering
for women and that they've codified this

441
00:26:33,561 --> 00:26:37,640
whole concept of asking
for something and offering.

442
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:42,080
So when you show up to a meetup for,
for Tech Lady Mafia,

443
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:47,470
it's that you might need something from
someone and you're also willing to give.

444
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,810
Because here's the thing we do.
Women do not like to ask for help.

445
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:56,550
We don't like to say, Hey, can you hook me
up with someone? Hey, can you, you know,

446
00:26:56,551 --> 00:26:58,320
I'm helping me.
I'm trying to design a website.

447
00:26:58,321 --> 00:27:01,500
I really don't know what I'm doing.
We don't really like to ask for help.

448
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,410
We tend to just sort of
take it all on ourselves.

449
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,700
But they've actually codified this
whole concept of asking and offering,

450
00:27:08,701 --> 00:27:13,250
which is really amazing to me. So that
was one of the networks that I found. Um,

451
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,071
but again,

452
00:27:14,071 --> 00:27:17,850
it's just sort of this whole sisterhood
that I feel like we're really feeling

453
00:27:17,851 --> 00:27:21,360
across the country right now,
particularly even after the election.

454
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,351
As a side note,

455
00:27:22,351 --> 00:27:26,010
I'm working on a project following
women who are running for office for the

456
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:31,011
first time and some of these candidates
have created their own political

457
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:36,420
networks of other women, which again,
completely sort of new and revolutionary,

458
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:40,050
which is really going to change the
whole landscape for women out there.

459
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,010
So to create, to create our serendipity,
we also have to have a strong network.

460
00:27:44,011 --> 00:27:46,050
We need to be able to lean into to women.

461
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:49,600
We also need to be able to grow our
networks because of course there's all of

462
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:52,410
these studies that show you
only know who you know, right?

463
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:57,240
So you're not going to really get jobs
or find other opportunities only by the

464
00:27:57,241 --> 00:28:00,450
network of people you know, you need
to keep expanding your boundaries.

465
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:03,450
So I thought this was pretty
fascinating too. And today,

466
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:07,830
as you all know in the tech space,
it's, you know, art meets technology,

467
00:28:07,831 --> 00:28:10,860
retail meets technology,
entertainment meets technology.

468
00:28:10,861 --> 00:28:13,020
There's all these intersections today.

469
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,740
And the more that we push out and
meet people who we don't yet know and

470
00:28:16,741 --> 00:28:19,380
experience industries that we
don't, who we don't, you know,

471
00:28:19,381 --> 00:28:24,310
or aren't familiar with, the more
opportunity we have for ourselves. Um,

472
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:29,130
and then the last or a theme that I
was really sort of into because it's so

473
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:33,750
obvious is branding, right?
How do we talk about ourselves?

474
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:36,810
How do we sort of share who we are?
Again,

475
00:28:36,811 --> 00:28:39,570
this is a concept that a lot of
women can be very squeamish about.

476
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,550
We don't like to brag about ourselves.

477
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,830
We don't like to boast
about what we've done.

478
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:47,800
And this really came to light when I was,
um,

479
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:52,880
I was speaking in Washington DC a
few weeks ago to a group of 50 female

480
00:28:52,921 --> 00:28:53,754
attorneys,

481
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:58,170
all of them unemployed because they had
all either worked at the White House for

482
00:28:58,171 --> 00:29:00,720
Obama or for the Justice
Department under Obama.

483
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:04,800
So we had 50 democratic women,
female attorneys,

484
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:08,130
all looking for a job.
And they said, you know,

485
00:29:08,131 --> 00:29:11,430
it was in November when when
Hillary lost the election,

486
00:29:11,431 --> 00:29:14,730
they knew they were going to need to
find a new job and they started writing

487
00:29:14,731 --> 00:29:18,300
their resumes and they said,
we work with all of these men.

488
00:29:18,301 --> 00:29:21,660
And you would have thought by looking
at these guys resumes that they were

489
00:29:21,661 --> 00:29:26,460
running the justice department. They
basically everything big that happened,

490
00:29:26,461 --> 00:29:30,870
they own, they did where the women
really thought, well, I was like, I mean,

491
00:29:30,871 --> 00:29:35,580
I was at that meeting, I was on that team,
you know, I can't really say I did that,

492
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:39,600
you know, but the guys that, you know,
they were like running the west wing also.

493
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,501
So,
you know,

494
00:29:40,501 --> 00:29:45,501
it's such interesting gender divide in
how we own what it is that we do and how

495
00:29:46,661 --> 00:29:49,060
we share with the world
what it is that we do.

496
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:52,240
But the only way for people to know
is that visibility again, right?

497
00:29:52,241 --> 00:29:55,180
Everything is online,
everything is through social media.

498
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,980
Everything is about networking.

499
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,980
If we don't tell people
what it is that we do well,

500
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,960
they're not going to know what we do well.

501
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,590
And so particularly when you're looking
for a job or you're looking to pivot or

502
00:30:05,591 --> 00:30:08,260
you're looking to explore,
you're keeping your eyes open.

503
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,440
People need to know what it
is that you do well, you know,

504
00:30:11,441 --> 00:30:15,000
as the kids call it today, like
what's your superpower? But you know,

505
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:19,480
surely you need to sort of own your own
narrative and what it is that you do and

506
00:30:19,481 --> 00:30:22,780
be able to share that with the world
and not feel so squeamish about it.

507
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,660
You know, it has been sort of
thought to be impolite to brag,

508
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:29,230
but I would like to sort of change
that whole notion that, you know,

509
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:32,110
branding yourself is not
necessarily bragging.

510
00:30:32,111 --> 00:30:36,460
It's about letting people know what
it is in the world that we do. Um,

511
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:41,940
so I would love to like open this up
to questions if anyone has questions so

512
00:30:43,021 --> 00:30:44,740
he's more fun to take questions.

513
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:47,710
Question.
Yup.

514
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:58,090
You most experience being a working woman,

515
00:30:58,850 --> 00:30:59,770
married and having kids,

516
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:04,340
some of your preferences now that
to life with the attorney. Um,

517
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,170
and I look back at,
I personally think I'm more,

518
00:31:08,171 --> 00:31:12,970
I feel Golda and more confident and more
willing to take risk monitor everything

519
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:14,920
from not my job,
everything actually off to having a child.

520
00:31:14,921 --> 00:31:17,770
So that was a positive even though
it presents it to him stream,

521
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:22,420
but it also look back at
my ESL and I'm like, wow,

522
00:31:22,421 --> 00:31:25,360
what a squandered opportunity to do
more. Someone. That's a great point.

523
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:29,260
I guess some of the people in this room
don't have it yet. Have you found me?

524
00:31:29,261 --> 00:31:33,850
I'm wondering what those of us to do
who doesn't yet have some of those other

525
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:34,770
times,
another commitment.

526
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,450
I think that's a great point.

527
00:31:36,451 --> 00:31:41,070
And I would say use that free time
before you have children to your fullest.

528
00:31:41,071 --> 00:31:45,960
Explore everything that you can, you
know, this is the time to create,

529
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,460
you know,
all of those,

530
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:51,650
seize those opportunities
and do everything that it
is that you want to do from

531
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:55,350
also even just traveling,
seeing the world and having experiences.

532
00:31:55,380 --> 00:32:00,330
Because certainly in the early years
and Zebra is young, you know, it's hard.

533
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:00,751
It's hard.

534
00:32:00,751 --> 00:32:05,670
My kids are teenagers now and it's
easier to have that also mental space.

535
00:32:05,671 --> 00:32:09,360
So I would not have been able to
write this book a few years ago.

536
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:14,361
I think that we also need that headspace
to be able to explore and to noodle and

537
00:32:14,521 --> 00:32:16,960
to get creative.
Um,

538
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:21,570
I also think that it's really important
for all of us at any stage in your life

539
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:24,600
to really get comfortable in
the uncomfortable. You know,

540
00:32:24,601 --> 00:32:29,070
that's the navy seals expression,
um, for obvious reasons. Uh,

541
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:33,810
and I'm sure it's been adopted by others,
but I really, I really by that belief,

542
00:32:33,811 --> 00:32:38,550
because that gives us all that opportunity
to get used to feeling a little

543
00:32:38,551 --> 00:32:41,240
uncomfortable. That's where
the greatest, you know,

544
00:32:41,241 --> 00:32:44,210
that's where all the amazing things
that we're going to do are going to come

545
00:32:44,211 --> 00:32:45,620
from.
That's where we're going,

546
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:50,210
able to be able to grow the most and
taking jobs that make us nervous,

547
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:54,870
right? Like when we get too complacent,
we're not bringing our a game. Um,

548
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:58,730
and I'll see, you know, what's risky for
one person is not risky for someone else.

549
00:32:58,731 --> 00:33:01,070
So it's figuring out what
that risk is for you.

550
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:05,693
Anyone else?

551
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:11,600
Can you speak a bit more to the concept
of pivoting and we launching? So,

552
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:12,853
um,

553
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:18,070
how in in your career have you,
um,

554
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:23,350
faced the need to pivot from perhaps
one particular field to a completely

555
00:33:25,191 --> 00:33:29,780
different one? Or could you just talk a
bit more about how that plays out? Sure.

556
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:32,140
You know, um, I, I have,

557
00:33:32,141 --> 00:33:35,980
I would say that the through line
to my career has been storytelling,

558
00:33:35,981 --> 00:33:39,460
but that's before it was even
called storytelling, right?
It was called, you know,

559
00:33:39,461 --> 00:33:43,120
reporting. It was called journalism.
It's called writing. Now.

560
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:47,560
It's all storytelling. Um, I did,
I really wanted to move into,

561
00:33:47,561 --> 00:33:51,310
I wanted to get some tech experience,
although I'm not an engineer,

562
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:55,000
I'm so not that kind of experience.
I've never coded before,

563
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:58,750
but I wanted to work for a tech company.
So I had started on the hill.

564
00:33:58,751 --> 00:34:03,220
So I started in politics and then I
moved to New York and I worked in TV.

565
00:34:03,221 --> 00:34:06,550
I worked at dateline,
NBC and Fox.

566
00:34:06,551 --> 00:34:11,551
And then Larry Ellison was starting this
new Internet computer company and I got

567
00:34:12,281 --> 00:34:16,150
a job to be his media director.
The company really blew up,

568
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:20,200
but it was my first experience going
to ces back in the day before cs became

569
00:34:20,201 --> 00:34:23,830
like so wild. Um, and so I did that.

570
00:34:23,831 --> 00:34:27,970
And then I actually written another book
I'm about on work life balance called

571
00:34:27,971 --> 00:34:28,990
how she really does it.

572
00:34:28,991 --> 00:34:32,890
And that actually led me into going into
what we would call the dark side for

573
00:34:32,891 --> 00:34:37,480
journalists. But I went into PR and I
was doing the other side of it all, um,

574
00:34:37,481 --> 00:34:39,610
which I actually had an okay
time with. Now, of course,

575
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:42,700
that's called branded content.
Everything that I was doing, you know,

576
00:34:42,701 --> 00:34:47,260
say the vernacular, it keeps changing.
Um, so I would say that, you know,

577
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:48,620
there's a bunch of different things to,

578
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:52,480
to mention with pivoting for people
who are going and doing a full one 80,

579
00:34:52,481 --> 00:34:55,240
you know,
like I want to become a dentist now,

580
00:34:55,241 --> 00:34:58,720
we'll obviously that would be incredibly
different and would require me to go to

581
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:02,920
dental school. Um, but a lot of things
when people say that they're pivoting,

582
00:35:02,921 --> 00:35:04,000
at least what I found,

583
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:07,600
there are things that are a little bit
almost companions to things that they're

584
00:35:07,601 --> 00:35:10,600
doing so they're not completely
removed from their skillsets.

585
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:15,670
So my whole advice is about really
leaning into your skills and just figuring

586
00:35:15,671 --> 00:35:19,300
out the new ones that you have to learn.
And as you know better than anyone,

587
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,950
you can do the stuff online.

588
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:25,510
There's a lot of ways to take classes
and you to have that whole side Gig that

589
00:35:25,511 --> 00:35:29,680
everyone, you know, seems to feel
very romantic about these days.

590
00:35:29,681 --> 00:35:34,390
But having that sort of side project
that you start noodling with to see,

591
00:35:34,391 --> 00:35:35,770
you know,
is there a viability here?

592
00:35:35,771 --> 00:35:39,870
Am I any good at it at can I make money
if I need to make money? You know,

593
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:41,520
what can I really do?

594
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:46,740
And what I've also found is just changing
the language of how we talk about

595
00:35:46,741 --> 00:35:48,060
ourselves.
I will tell you,

596
00:35:48,061 --> 00:35:52,980
I have scrubbed my linkedin profile
in the past 10 years probably,

597
00:35:52,981 --> 00:35:56,010
you know,
35 times because I keep seeing where,

598
00:35:56,011 --> 00:35:58,650
how job descriptions are being posted.
Now.

599
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,610
The language being used is so different
than the language I was using.

600
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:03,011
You know it.

601
00:36:03,011 --> 00:36:06,570
So now everything that I've done in
my past seems to be storytelling and

602
00:36:06,571 --> 00:36:09,780
marketing. I would never have called
myself a marketing person before.

603
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:13,530
But yet that's what branded content is
and that's what you know. And so it's,

604
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,060
the world just keeps changing.

605
00:36:15,061 --> 00:36:20,061
So it's about also not feeling
like a fraud for calling yourself,

606
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:20,841
you know,

607
00:36:20,841 --> 00:36:24,800
putting that label on when you feel like
that label isn't exactly what you went

608
00:36:24,801 --> 00:36:29,300
to school for. But that's
what they're calling it now.
And yes, your skills apply.

609
00:36:29,301 --> 00:36:32,270
So,
I'm not saying lie and be a fraud at all,

610
00:36:32,271 --> 00:36:35,810
but I'm saying that we have to be a little
bit more open minded and realize that

611
00:36:35,811 --> 00:36:40,610
to stay relevant you need to really see
where trends are going and see how you

612
00:36:40,611 --> 00:36:44,030
fit in there. Or if you want,
I could do a total relaunch,

613
00:36:44,031 --> 00:36:48,530
figure out what do you need to know
and learn to completely shift gears,

614
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,110
which could be incredibly different
than what you know right now.

615
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:53,920
Okay.

616
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,330
Hey there. I'm, so, I was actually
at the confidence girl code,

617
00:36:58,331 --> 00:37:01,690
whatever it's called, a
conference. Yeah. Um, that, uh,

618
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,520
they hosted a catty, catty
Shipman and whatnot. And, and, uh,

619
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:10,590
Baltimore a few months ago
I was a panelist on the
stem panel and so I took my

620
00:37:11,441 --> 00:37:15,710
daughter and we attended the whole
conference actually, and you know,

621
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:19,540
kind of a summary of some of the
messages I heard was, you know,

622
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:23,770
obviously be confidence, stand up
straight, you know, give a firm handshake,

623
00:37:23,771 --> 00:37:27,340
look them in the eye, um, but
be authentic, be yourself.

624
00:37:27,341 --> 00:37:30,610
And it was like this tug of war of,
um,

625
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:35,760
advice that I felt like was
kind of contradictory in
the message because at the

626
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:41,230
end of the day we're telling women to
sort of reshape themselves to be more

627
00:37:41,231 --> 00:37:44,860
acceptable in the male
environment. Right. And, um,

628
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:48,070
one of the things that I really
liked about, you know, uh,

629
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:52,420
Google and like the Silicon Valley is
that this concept of you don't have to

630
00:37:52,421 --> 00:37:57,340
wear a suit to be taken seriously.
And so, uh, the point is that you can,

631
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:02,400
you don't have to look a certain way as
a man or a sound a certain way or even

632
00:38:02,531 --> 00:38:04,600
be particularly social,

633
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:08,910
socially acceptable to be taken seriously.
And you know,

634
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,200
what really mattered was
like that you were smart,

635
00:38:11,201 --> 00:38:15,910
you had great ideas and you got the
thing done, right. So, I guess my,

636
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:19,420
this is probably more of a comment to
see you, what your response might be,

637
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:24,550
but my hope is that we can get to a
place where we can stop telling women to

638
00:38:24,551 --> 00:38:29,260
change themselves and get to a place
where just like the culture we have built

639
00:38:29,261 --> 00:38:33,550
here, you can be whatever you need
to be as a person and it's still,

640
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:38,530
you'll still be accepted because of the
you produce is excellent. Um, so you know,

641
00:38:38,531 --> 00:38:42,410
that that's sort of, I guess I'm kind
of tired of hearing all the, you know,

642
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:47,920
do this, do that. And I did all those
things. And so when I sit on panels now,

643
00:38:47,921 --> 00:38:51,820
would I say to the, to the young women
thinking about careers in tech is,

644
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,750
you know, I'm going to be honest
with you. You can give, you know,

645
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:57,950
you can stand up as straight
as you can stand up,

646
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:02,710
you can give from handshakes until
you make their knuckles bleed.

647
00:39:02,711 --> 00:39:05,260
You can, you know, be the
smartest person in the room,

648
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:09,310
but you're always going to
be disadvantaged because
you're a woman and there's

649
00:39:09,311 --> 00:39:14,140
literally nothing you can do
to change that. And so, uh,

650
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:14,970
you know,

651
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:18,540
I think you're making all very important
points that I think we can all really

652
00:39:18,541 --> 00:39:23,270
appreciate. And you know,
one of the things that I,
when I was talking about it,

653
00:39:23,271 --> 00:39:26,580
even writing about Hillary Clinton in
the book and the way she was perceived in

654
00:39:26,581 --> 00:39:30,360
her shrill tone and she's not warm, she's
not authentic, she's too smiley. She's,

655
00:39:30,361 --> 00:39:33,540
you know, whatever it may be. No one
likes the way she looks in her suits.

656
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:37,980
She needs to lose weight, all of that
kind of stuff. You're absolutely right.

657
00:39:37,981 --> 00:39:40,110
And one of the women
who I quote in the book,

658
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:44,220
she talks about the fact that we
need to rehear the way women speak.

659
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:49,340
She actually makes this comparison to
pre title nine and sports and women that

660
00:39:50,581 --> 00:39:54,840
the way that women in sports were
perceived, you know, 20 years ago,

661
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:59,850
I would argue still a bit today, um,
that they're not given the same validity.

662
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,440
They're certainly not
given the same money.

663
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:04,530
We see that with the u s soccer
team with a women's soccer, um,

664
00:40:04,531 --> 00:40:08,930
that they make less than men, yet they
win way more than the guys do. Um,

665
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,840
but even that whole idea
that anyone should tune in
and watch women play soccer,

666
00:40:12,841 --> 00:40:14,550
that has changed.
Right?

667
00:40:14,551 --> 00:40:18,390
I would say that people still aren't
really watching the women and be a league

668
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:22,330
the way that they watched the men because
people say it's not as exciting. Um,

669
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:24,700
and they don't have the same
kind of money. But the idea,

670
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:28,980
the notion is that we as a country,

671
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,320
as a people need to rehear
the way that women speak.

672
00:40:34,321 --> 00:40:36,630
So if a woman is sounding a little,

673
00:40:36,631 --> 00:40:40,890
her voice is going to be higher than
most men because that's the way women are

674
00:40:40,891 --> 00:40:45,360
built. To not discredit that
and not think that that is,

675
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,260
you know,

676
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:50,940
Q harsh or too bitchy or too annoying
that we almost adapt to that.

677
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,510
So I do think that, and maybe I'm
being a little Pollyanna here,

678
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:58,260
but I think as more women move up
the ranks and as we lift more women,

679
00:40:58,261 --> 00:41:02,700
as the sisterhood keeps bringing women
up with, with them, and as I'm seeing,

680
00:41:02,701 --> 00:41:06,690
and as I feel very strongly about
that things will start changing.

681
00:41:06,691 --> 00:41:09,360
We'll see more females in technology.

682
00:41:09,361 --> 00:41:11,280
We'll see more women
in leadership position,

683
00:41:11,281 --> 00:41:15,600
we'll see more women in Congress and we
will adapt and accept the way they look,

684
00:41:15,601 --> 00:41:18,480
the way they sound, they will,
the way that they communicate.

685
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,420
And that is when things
will start changing.

686
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:24,450
But even women don't like the
way that women present. I mean,

687
00:41:24,451 --> 00:41:26,400
we really saw that play
out on the election.

688
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:30,660
It was really sort of shocking to so
many of us when we looked at the numbers

689
00:41:30,661 --> 00:41:32,730
and we looked at, you
know, what was coming back.

690
00:41:32,731 --> 00:41:34,730
It was like women just
didn't even like women.

691
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:38,090
And that's another big issue
of what needs to change.

692
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,590
Yeah. Yeah. I think I, you know,

693
00:41:39,591 --> 00:41:42,500
I think what I'd like to see
is more books around how to,

694
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:46,230
how to be a person that can just
accept women the way they are. I mean,

695
00:41:46,231 --> 00:41:47,960
I w the advice when I,
you know,

696
00:41:47,961 --> 00:41:50,090
I heard the advice around don't
say I'm sorry you so much.

697
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:53,930
I've heard it a lot and I really tried
myself to not do it until I reached a

698
00:41:53,931 --> 00:41:58,580
point where I was like, you
know what? Maybe we have it
right to say you're sorry.

699
00:41:58,581 --> 00:42:02,630
It's like a good thing. It's like you're
being kind and empathetic, compassionate,

700
00:42:02,631 --> 00:42:03,464
considerate.

701
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:08,150
Maybe the advice should be to the assholes
who treat people who say, I'm sorry,

702
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:11,600
badly to not do that. Right. As
opposed to the other way around.

703
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,390
Well, I think you're, you
know, being authentic.

704
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:17,750
There's nothing wrong with
being authentic. I think
that when we are authentic,

705
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:21,560
that is actually the people who come
across the most authentic are the ones who

706
00:42:21,561 --> 00:42:26,090
get jobs are well liked and there's
tons of studies on all of that.

707
00:42:26,091 --> 00:42:27,590
But when we are faking it,

708
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,370
people you know can size
that up in a millisecond.

709
00:42:31,371 --> 00:42:34,850
I mean we see facial expressions and
we're sort of brilliant at seeing an

710
00:42:34,851 --> 00:42:37,190
authenticity.
So keep being you.

711
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:41,683
In your research,

712
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:46,100
did you hear any murmurings or
indications that perhaps men,

713
00:42:46,101 --> 00:42:49,820
are you learning and listening from
how you approach things? You know,

714
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:53,460
getting to the point
of closing one lately,

715
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:57,260
I don't think it's just what
can we learn from them, right?

716
00:42:57,261 --> 00:43:00,000
And be better at what are we doing right.

717
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,013
Is there anything,

718
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:03,951
well,

719
00:43:03,951 --> 00:43:08,330
I mean there are a lot of studies that
show that the nurturing skills that women

720
00:43:08,331 --> 00:43:11,480
have are incredibly
effective in leadership.

721
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:15,890
And we also know that when women are at
the top and organizations when they have

722
00:43:15,891 --> 00:43:19,880
more management roles, when they are
in c suite roles, businesses do better.

723
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:24,770
I mean that is like study after study
after study proves that diversity is good

724
00:43:24,771 --> 00:43:26,800
for the bottom line. Um, I,

725
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:31,250
I didn't really see that the guys are
looking to women to sort of soften up or

726
00:43:31,251 --> 00:43:35,540
to be more collaborative or to do
the things that women do so well,

727
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:39,050
I think that, you know, to, to the
other, I don't know your name, but

728
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:42,890
cat to caddies point,

729
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:48,130
that embracing who we are as women is
really important and really essential.

730
00:43:48,261 --> 00:43:51,280
And, and I agree. We
don't need to change. Um,

731
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:55,760
we need to be aware of how we present
because the truth is the rest of the world

732
00:43:55,761 --> 00:43:59,930
hasn't caught up to our shed. Um, so
we, I think it starts with an awareness,

733
00:43:59,931 --> 00:44:02,960
even back to Tammy Reese's Gmail Plugin.
She's not saying,

734
00:44:02,961 --> 00:44:05,810
never say just her actually or I'm sorry.

735
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:10,310
It's more of like an awareness
of how we're communicating. Um,

736
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:13,850
but I do think that women should be
leaning into all of this skills that we do

737
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:17,150
so well, which is we're
great collaborators. Right?

738
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:19,880
So even going back to that
whole idea about networking,

739
00:44:19,881 --> 00:44:22,460
I've spoken to many rooms and
I'll say to women, you know,

740
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:25,970
who likes to network here? I mean, I
can ask you all who likes to network?

741
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:29,840
Anyone like to network? No. So,
okay, well you liked it. Well,

742
00:44:29,841 --> 00:44:32,550
you're really confident,
authentic and good for you.

743
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:37,020
But so many women don't like to
now work. We feel that. It's like,

744
00:44:37,021 --> 00:44:39,510
it makes us feel a little
like uncomfortable. You know,

745
00:44:39,511 --> 00:44:44,370
we're like asking for something and
transactional and it feels very cold.

746
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:47,070
Um, guides it had been
doing it forever. Right?

747
00:44:47,071 --> 00:44:49,980
They go in and they say what they need,
they're at, they get to be here, you know,

748
00:44:49,981 --> 00:44:54,810
they go play golf, done. Women don't
like to do that, but we'll we're really,

749
00:44:54,811 --> 00:44:58,950
really good at is building relationships
and we're really good at creating

750
00:44:58,951 --> 00:45:02,820
relationships that last a long time.
We need to play the long game.

751
00:45:02,821 --> 00:45:06,600
So I would argue that women,
we need to sort of rethink networking,

752
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:10,860
thinking of think of it more even like
relabeling that like we're connecting,

753
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:15,210
we're showing up and we are connecting
because women do that really, really well.

754
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,490
We bond very quickly. You put, you know,

755
00:45:17,491 --> 00:45:20,590
if we were all sitting
together and like five minutes,

756
00:45:20,591 --> 00:45:22,920
I'd know what you all did for a living,
where you lived.

757
00:45:22,921 --> 00:45:25,260
If you were dating someone,
if you had a child,

758
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,230
I might comment and you're
like the coolest shoes that
you're wearing, you know,

759
00:45:28,231 --> 00:45:31,260
whatever it may be.
That is what women bond very,

760
00:45:31,261 --> 00:45:33,450
very naturally and very authentically.

761
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:38,130
So I really do think it's almost re
imagining what networking is and realizing

762
00:45:38,131 --> 00:45:42,720
that we're building sort of relationships
with one another that are real,

763
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:46,890
that are authentic and that
we know will last awhile.

764
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,940
Folks.
I'm sorry if you have a question,

765
00:45:50,941 --> 00:45:54,150
if you can use the two mikes just so
that the sound is picked up properly.

766
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:55,183
Thank you.

767
00:45:58,550 --> 00:45:59,750
Um,
I think,

768
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:04,870
I mean obviously it's true that like I
think we have it right and I think we are

769
00:46:05,331 --> 00:46:10,331
aware of that like of the issues that
women face that like woman women aren't

770
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:14,270
wrong for doing the things that they do
and the way they present being warm is

771
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,700
never a bad thing.
Being kind is never a bad thing.

772
00:46:16,701 --> 00:46:21,701
But I mean I feel like we are in the very
vast minority of people who are aware

773
00:46:22,641 --> 00:46:26,960
of this issue. And obviously you
mentioned um, Hillary Clinton,

774
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:32,060
like the, the vast majority
of America is not aware that,

775
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:36,140
you know, the things like not aware
of the biases that we are aware of.

776
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:39,020
So I guess like navigating
through this world. Like,

777
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:43,100
I obviously am not condoning that
we should like change or anything.

778
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:47,540
But you did mention like you wanted to
say sorry because you felt like that was

779
00:46:47,541 --> 00:46:50,510
how you came off as warm.
So a warmer when,

780
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:54,710
cause I grew up people calling me bossy
all the time because I was confident and

781
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:57,080
I was able to say what I wanted without,

782
00:46:57,490 --> 00:47:02,060
I'm not being rude but in just a
sense being direct. But how do you,

783
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:03,950
how do you avoid that?
Like what kinds of strategies?

784
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:07,710
Like could you delve more into like
other things you've tried as well?

785
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:11,400
Yeah, yeah, I do think that a
lot of it, his facial expression.

786
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:14,100
So the problem when I was
told that I was Abrasive,

787
00:47:14,101 --> 00:47:15,900
I was actually working remotely.

788
00:47:15,901 --> 00:47:18,240
So a lot of my conversations
were over the phone.

789
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:21,960
So I thought I was being very direct.
And My boss actually said to me,

790
00:47:21,961 --> 00:47:26,700
who is a woman? She said, I know that
you're warm, I use smile. You know,

791
00:47:26,701 --> 00:47:30,400
you're very engaging in person, but you
know, on the phone people think, you know,

792
00:47:30,401 --> 00:47:32,680
you're a little bossy.
And again,

793
00:47:32,681 --> 00:47:36,790
like a man would never have been accused
of being bossy. I was just direct.

794
00:47:36,791 --> 00:47:38,470
I thought, um, you know, we've got time,

795
00:47:38,471 --> 00:47:43,150
we've got 30 minutes on the call in out
done good. They're not seeing me smile,

796
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:48,160
you know, because it's on the phone.
Um, but I do think so that personal,

797
00:47:48,161 --> 00:47:52,510
so what I have learned is I
do try to smile a lot. I mean,

798
00:47:52,511 --> 00:47:55,300
it's not a natural for me to smile.
I'm,

799
00:47:55,301 --> 00:47:58,000
I'm thinking I'm probably
now more aware of that.

800
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:02,850
And I also think maybe there's also comes
with a little bit more confidence and

801
00:48:02,851 --> 00:48:06,490
age also of just, I'm not feeling
like I have something to prove,

802
00:48:06,491 --> 00:48:08,920
so maybe I'm not coming
in, sit like, you know,

803
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,230
like the bull in the
China store type of thing,

804
00:48:11,231 --> 00:48:15,880
that I'm a little bit
softer as I even speak. Um,

805
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:20,440
but yeah, I do. I am, I'm
hyper aware of how I present.

806
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:25,030
And so my advice to you
is smile, smile, warmth,

807
00:48:25,031 --> 00:48:27,610
and then say what you need to say.
Be Smart.

808
00:48:27,611 --> 00:48:32,590
Never Hedge on being smart as none of
us would do, I'm sure. But you know,

809
00:48:32,591 --> 00:48:35,920
you want to come across
and make your points clear.

810
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:37,360
There was something else that,
um,

811
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:39,670
that I didn't mention when I was
talking that I think is actually really

812
00:48:39,671 --> 00:48:42,670
interesting and it goes to sort of the
solidarity of the sisterhood in this

813
00:48:42,671 --> 00:48:45,970
networking and the change that I'm seeing
and I write about and it's called the

814
00:48:45,971 --> 00:48:50,170
amplification effect, if you all
heard of this. Yeah. Right. Right on.

815
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:52,210
So for those who don't know,

816
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:57,270
I had read about this and the Washington
Post that the women in the Obama White

817
00:48:57,610 --> 00:49:01,120
House realized very early in the
administration that they were being,

818
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,400
they were being ignored,

819
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:07,540
they were ignored by the president and
by pretty much everyone in the west wing.

820
00:49:07,541 --> 00:49:10,180
And they'd come into
meetings and you know,

821
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:12,280
the president never called on them for,

822
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:15,120
for questions or further thoughts
or anything like that. Um,

823
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,110
or if they did speak up,

824
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:20,950
their ideas were being usurped
by the guy in the room, you know,

825
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,790
so they made a point in all of a sudden,
you know, like John Zoning that point.

826
00:49:24,791 --> 00:49:28,870
So they got together and they realized
that they needed to do something about

827
00:49:28,871 --> 00:49:32,560
this and that they were going to
amplify each other's messages.

828
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:36,130
So if yes, if something brilliant
in a meeting with the president,

829
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:39,520
as I'm sure she has, um, I
would then say, you know,

830
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:44,500
as you said earlier and letting you know
now the point is being owned by Yaz.

831
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:47,980
I'm emphasizing that the president's
looking over it. Yasmina like, oh yeah,

832
00:49:47,981 --> 00:49:51,820
smart lady. Um, good point.
And they started doing that.

833
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:55,600
They started making sure that they were
calling on each other and reinforcing

834
00:49:55,601 --> 00:49:59,110
the comments to make sure that the guys
weren't stealing any of these ideas.

835
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:00,880
But something interesting happened,

836
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:05,290
which was that President Obama
started calling on the women more,

837
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:08,140
started inviting them to more meetings.
They were visible,

838
00:50:08,141 --> 00:50:09,880
they made themselves visible.

839
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:13,990
So this whole concept of amplifying
each other is really important.

840
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:17,620
And certainly not just in the west
wing, but in the workspace, right?

841
00:50:17,621 --> 00:50:22,150
We need to be supporting each other. We
need to be recognizing what we're saying,

842
00:50:22,151 --> 00:50:24,430
what our contributions are.
And it's really,

843
00:50:24,431 --> 00:50:28,190
really helpful to have
someone else do that for. Um,

844
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:32,270
I don't know if anyone here read
Jessica had bandits book. Um,

845
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,810
and I'm going to screw up the name.
It's the feminist fight club is her,

846
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:38,270
is her book and which is a great read.

847
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:43,600
And she writes about having a boast bitch
and that boosts bitch is someone who,

848
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,220
by the way he, it could be your best
friend, it could be your mother,

849
00:50:46,221 --> 00:50:50,780
it could be your sister,
it's having someone be able
to amplify messages for you.

850
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:55,520
And I'm sure there's tons of studies on
with Facebook likes and Instagram likes

851
00:50:55,521 --> 00:50:58,780
and you know what gets the most likes
and all this kinds of stuff. But there,

852
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:02,090
but there is something to be said when
someone else says something about you or

853
00:51:02,091 --> 00:51:06,740
someone posts something like, oh I'm
so proud of, you know, my wife for her,

854
00:51:06,741 --> 00:51:10,130
you know, her book was published
that tends to get more likes.

855
00:51:10,131 --> 00:51:13,400
And if I actually put out, Hey,
my book was published, you know,

856
00:51:13,401 --> 00:51:16,700
so it's the same sort of concept.
So you have someone else.

857
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:21,050
You have someone who amplifying the
great work that you're doing in the

858
00:51:21,051 --> 00:51:24,140
workplace, and having that boast bitch
is really effective. And I, first of all,

859
00:51:24,141 --> 00:51:26,090
I just loved the idea.
Um,

860
00:51:26,091 --> 00:51:29,510
and I think it's very empowering and very
much of the sisterhood that we need to

861
00:51:29,511 --> 00:51:33,190
be supporting each other.
I know I digressed.

862
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:40,890
Does anyone have any other questions?
I think we need to wrap it up. Okay.

863
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:44,550
Thank you all. Thank you guys for inviting
me. Thank you Google for having me.

864
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:47,610
This is quite an honor to be here.
Truly.

865
00:51:47,611 --> 00:51:51,930
I'm thrilled to have been able to speak
at Google. This is really very exciting.

866
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:52,650
Thank you.
