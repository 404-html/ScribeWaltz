Thank you.

33
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,250
Really good. Thank you. Thank you for
being here. Um, quick housekeeping. Uh,

34
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,280
please silence all devices and we will
have some time for Q and a at the end.

35
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,550
Uh, since we're recording, it's very
important that if you have a question,

36
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:16,090
please ask it at one of the
two mikes in the aisles. Okay.

37
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:21,210
So for people in the audience who might
not be familiar with Vayner media, um,

38
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:26,140
what would you say is the
company's mission and how
is that different from other

39
00:02:26,141 --> 00:02:27,790
companies in your
industry or other country

40
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,480
in general? Yeah, so we're
a full VaynerMedia is a
full service digital agency.

41
00:02:32,481 --> 00:02:37,370
So we're really a creative shop that
marries both paid media creative and

42
00:02:37,371 --> 00:02:41,170
strategy in the middle. I'm not
unlike a lot of other agencies that,

43
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,140
that you probably work
with for sure. And, uh,

44
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,460
Gary would say our mission is to build,
uh,

45
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:49,950
the biggest human empire of
all kind of all time. Um,

46
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:53,900
I'd like to be a part of that for sure.
But I think the,

47
00:02:53,901 --> 00:02:58,310
the differentiator for us
is that we really do put
people at the center that we,

48
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:02,620
because we're an independent,
uh, independently owned agency,

49
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,360
of course we're,
we,

50
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:08,940
we want to make sure that we're paying
attention to our top and bottom line and

51
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,730
the growth there. But it is
really the people that fuel
all of that. And I really,

52
00:03:12,731 --> 00:03:16,840
I, I personally think that the
emphasis that we put on people,

53
00:03:16,841 --> 00:03:18,610
the emphasis that we put on culture,

54
00:03:18,611 --> 00:03:21,280
the emphasis that we even
have a job like mine,

55
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:25,750
which is very different than a chief
HR officer, which we'll get to,

56
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:29,410
I'm sure. Um, that in
itself sets us apart.

57
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,410
I don't think it makes us
better or holier than thou,

58
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:34,630
I think it just makes us very different.

59
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:38,290
And it is something that is hard
to Grok sometimes that, yeah. Okay,

60
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:43,060
well are you just like Droga five or
are you like anomaly? We're different.

61
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,620
We really beat to a different drum.

62
00:03:44,621 --> 00:03:48,760
And I think a lot of that is because
of who Gary Vaynerchuk is and, and, uh,

63
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:49,050
you know,

64
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:54,010
incredibly fast moving and
path that is known for hustle.

65
00:03:54,011 --> 00:03:58,260
But quite frankly, he's got a
heck of a lot of heart. So, uh,

66
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:02,830
the term honey empire comes up frequently
in reference to Vayner. In your role,

67
00:04:02,831 --> 00:04:05,290
can you explain what that
means? Yeah, I can. There's,

68
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:09,660
there's a lot of different breakdowns, but
I've, I've definitely honed my, my, um,

69
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,750
my verbatim. I think at this point
there's two different ways I look at it.

70
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,280
So p being people first,

71
00:04:15,281 --> 00:04:18,220
that's obviously the honey that
is taking care of the people.

72
00:04:18,221 --> 00:04:21,010
That is making sure that if
someone is having a bad day,

73
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,590
we're taking care of them.
If someone got engaged or married,

74
00:04:23,591 --> 00:04:24,610
we're celebrating that.

75
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:29,900
And it is really the idea of
creating champions from one another.

76
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,870
The collaboration,
the um,

77
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:37,950
the emphasis on working together to create
the biggest honey empire of all time.

78
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,880
The empire of course is the,
is as much more of the success.

79
00:04:42,881 --> 00:04:47,470
It's much more of the at the client
success, the personal success, the uh,

80
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,590
the agency shop success.
So that is one way to look at it.

81
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,410
The other way I like to
look at it as something,

82
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:55,360
actually I am going to use
this little Easel d mind.

83
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:00,430
Hopefully I'm writing big enough for
the, for the camera. But fundamentally,

84
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,330
if I think about how I, uh, how I look at,

85
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:07,750
at building strong teams and
a and building teams that
are sustainable and they

86
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:11,200
last a,
I look at starting with the connection

87
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,130
again, hopefully that can be re read.
So connection as human beings we are,

88
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:22,300
we are absolutely wired to belong.
We are wired to connect with one another,

89
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,900
connection plus trust.

90
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,850
So once I connect with you and I'm kind
of like in it with you, we start to,

91
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,490
we start to trust one another. I might
let my guard down a little bit more.

92
00:05:34,491 --> 00:05:37,810
It might be a little bit easier with you
might share something about myself with

93
00:05:37,811 --> 00:05:40,720
you
plus empathy.

94
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:47,250
So I trust now, but now I'm sharing
something. Maybe I'm sharing about, uh,

95
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,380
an issue I'm having on another team
or maybe I'm sharing something about

96
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,640
something, a family, a family issue
or celebration or something like that.

97
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,770
Connection plus trust plus

98
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:03,170
honey equals accountability,

99
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,500
which also is another way to say loyalty.
Longevity.

100
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,340
We want our people to be there
with us for the long haul.

101
00:06:18,341 --> 00:06:20,800
We want Vayner people to be
with us forever. Quite frankly.

102
00:06:20,801 --> 00:06:25,210
Gary will say that I want you to
work with me forever. Accountability,

103
00:06:25,211 --> 00:06:27,160
longevity,
resilience.

104
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,680
Who doesn't need resilience
in these times? I mean,
things are changing. I'm, I'm,

105
00:06:31,681 --> 00:06:33,090
I'm sure you already launched the,
you know,

106
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,550
three different products while I've been
sitting here with you today. And, um,

107
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,220
but digital, the world of digital
is changing every single second.

108
00:06:39,221 --> 00:06:42,630
So you need to be able to roll with
those punches. And also, you know,

109
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,910
Gary is a disruptor. He's an, he's
an entrepreneur. I mean, it is,

110
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,690
he could say today, by the time we get
back, uh, we're not going to do that.

111
00:06:49,691 --> 00:06:51,640
We're going to do this.
And we all have to pivot very quickly.

112
00:06:51,641 --> 00:06:55,510
So resilience is really important, and
our teams and our people, accountability,

113
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,810
longevity, resilience, equal speeds.

114
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,050
This is the empire right here. Speed
is our number one KPI. People first.

115
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,230
Here are the feelings. Here are all the
things that I care about all day long.

116
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,690
Right?
And here's the empire,

117
00:07:10,691 --> 00:07:13,540
the fact of how do we get
it across the finish line?

118
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:18,100
So I hope that answered the question in
a very esoteric way. Yeah, that's great.

119
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,620
Um, so you mentioned, I think you
probably get this question all the time.

120
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:28,650
How is your role as chief heart officer
different from a traditional chief HR

121
00:07:29,441 --> 00:07:33,730
officer role? Yeah, I mean, I'm
not HR at all. I've, I've, um,

122
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:38,440
I've never been HR. In fact, I, I
started in 98, I think before Google,

123
00:07:38,441 --> 00:07:41,680
before Facebook as a project manager in,
in San Francisco,

124
00:07:41,681 --> 00:07:46,660
and then morphed my way into
the agency side on the client,

125
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,910
client facing side. And, um,

126
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:52,810
and then found my home in
strategy and a way, way,

127
00:07:52,811 --> 00:07:56,500
way back when I was training to be a
psychotherapist. So human development,

128
00:07:56,501 --> 00:07:58,390
human behavior is always
something that's really,

129
00:07:58,391 --> 00:08:01,560
really fascinated me and
still does to this day. Uh,

130
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:05,950
that's kind of like everything
for me, how we work, why we work,

131
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:10,710
how we can work better. And, uh, so I've,

132
00:08:10,711 --> 00:08:13,420
I've been a strategist for a
very long time, almost 20 years,

133
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:17,660
and I am not HR, not a, I'm not, I'm,

134
00:08:17,661 --> 00:08:21,700
I'm certainly now HR and I'm more equipped
and more educated in the science of

135
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:24,320
HR and the benefits and, and, uh,

136
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:27,770
international visas and
laws and whatnot. But, um,

137
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:32,080
that's not my job. We have some
incredible HR people in the, in, in, uh,

138
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:35,140
the crowd right now that are on my team,
which is amazing.

139
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,050
And they really take care of,
um, the, the HR factor, the,

140
00:08:40,051 --> 00:08:43,270
the science of it, the benefits, payroll,

141
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:48,280
401k's and, and really, really
the reviews, the review cycle,

142
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:52,750
all of those things as well. So my job
isn't, I mean, you, you would say that,

143
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:57,510
send that to Claude because she's
a head of HR, but, but I'm not,

144
00:08:57,511 --> 00:09:00,030
I get to oversee that,
which is,

145
00:09:00,031 --> 00:09:05,031
and I get to cocreate with people that
know more than I know in terms of HR and

146
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,570
he'll, Gary really sees himself as HR
because he's a people first person.

147
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:14,630
And so the synergy that he and I have
in terms of how we feel about people,

148
00:09:15,661 --> 00:09:17,850
our belief in people,
um,

149
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:23,390
our gut about people is
really what created this role
and why we call it heart.

150
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,280
Because we actually think of HR,

151
00:09:26,281 --> 00:09:30,090
which I have no idea what that
really means as hard. In fact,

152
00:09:30,091 --> 00:09:32,100
we changed the name of
the department when I,

153
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,220
when I started to people and experience,
because after all,

154
00:09:35,221 --> 00:09:39,390
that's what we're doing here. You have a,
um, a department of, you know, people ops.

155
00:09:39,391 --> 00:09:40,900
It's very similar,
similar,

156
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:46,080
but the idea of human resources to me
is very foreign. I, I really, I don't,

157
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,630
um, I don't get it, but, um,

158
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,720
but if anyone wants to
explain those two terms to me,

159
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:56,490
I'm open so people can experience and, um,
and really I'm not, I'm not chief of HR,

160
00:09:56,491 --> 00:10:00,840
but, uh, but again, we've got a great
team that, that takes care of that.

161
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,180
Excellent. So, uh,

162
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:07,590
one of the things you've called
yourself as an emphatic truth teller,

163
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,251
uh,

164
00:10:08,251 --> 00:10:13,251
when you were describing what it was
that Gary needed to sort of scale what he

165
00:10:13,921 --> 00:10:18,660
did for the organization as
the organization expanded, um,

166
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,540
what's the hardest truth
you've had to tell or,

167
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,430
or at least the hardest one you can share?

168
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:28,060
Sure. It's, uh, it's empathic. Empathic,

169
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,810
I think someone wants to call
me an empathic truth. Okay.

170
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:34,130
Maybe I didn't tell her his heard that.
Maybe it's an emphatic, I don't know.

171
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:39,320
I'm sure I, hopefully it's
enthusiastic, but, um, you know, it's,

172
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,660
it's hard.
It is a challenge.

173
00:10:43,661 --> 00:10:48,661
I think sometimes to confront someone
with something they might may not see

174
00:10:50,081 --> 00:10:51,730
about themselves.
Um,

175
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:55,360
it's hard as another human
being to take that step,

176
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:58,960
that bold step forward as a just
another learner in the world.

177
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,280
And to think that I see something that
they don't see. I'm by no means am I,

178
00:11:03,281 --> 00:11:06,220
you know, I'm not a psychotherapist.
I'm, I'm not a physician.

179
00:11:06,221 --> 00:11:11,221
So it's really difficult to get up the
gumption and want to shine a mirror in

180
00:11:14,021 --> 00:11:16,960
front of someone. And I think that is,
that's a difficult thing that we all have.

181
00:11:16,961 --> 00:11:17,794
However,

182
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,210
when we give feedback and when we
share something with another person,

183
00:11:22,211 --> 00:11:27,120
it's really an active caring. So when I
don't do that, I'm really withholding,

184
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:31,850
quite frankly. I'm, I'm manipulating
someone's growth and development and, um,

185
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:36,700
the way I go about it is as,
as hopefully with as much grace tack and,

186
00:11:36,701 --> 00:11:39,520
um, and you can generosity
of spirit as I possibly can.

187
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,620
But that is something that
I think is, is, um, is I,

188
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:48,550
you just have to step wisely into that,
into those shoes.

189
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:52,840
I'm cautiously of course, because you
never know how someone's going to react.

190
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,460
But if you,
um,

191
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:59,090
if you go into that truth
again with empathy, um,

192
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,480
and with humility,
my God,

193
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,650
then I think the door can open to so
much possibility and that's what it's all

194
00:12:05,651 --> 00:12:06,484
about.

195
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:11,670
Possibilities there an example
that you can think of where, yeah,

196
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:14,920
telling that truth. There's an
example. I mean, when did I get here?

197
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:19,980
So I think an hour ago I was
in a room with a very senior,

198
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:25,090
um, senior account holder count
and our client service person,

199
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:26,710
and this,
uh,

200
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:31,570
this person was telling me that he has
been exploring his team for the last

201
00:12:31,571 --> 00:12:34,400
three months and these are the three
buckets that he thinks are, uh,

202
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,320
wrong with his team.
So it's probably my age.

203
00:12:38,321 --> 00:12:42,550
He's in his forties and um, and he,
maybe he knows more about life than I do.

204
00:12:42,551 --> 00:12:47,290
I have no idea. But he and I have
had many conversations over the past,

205
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:50,440
I would say eight or nine
months about these, these, uh,

206
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,260
issues in his team and only
today he's bringing them to me.

207
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,680
So what I did say to him is,
you know, with all due respect,

208
00:12:56,681 --> 00:13:00,460
I really believe that you've been
protecting your team this entire time.

209
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:05,470
There's no need to protect your team
and these three buckets that you just

210
00:13:05,471 --> 00:13:06,310
shared with us,

211
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,580
it should have been shared with me nine
months ago because we could have fixed

212
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:10,210
it.

213
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:13,780
We didn't need to go through
all the rigmarole and all
the people issues and all

214
00:13:13,781 --> 00:13:18,190
the, the hardship and all the missed
deadlines and all of those things if we,

215
00:13:18,191 --> 00:13:20,650
if we just could get truth.

216
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:24,710
So that's probably the most
recent conversation. And,

217
00:13:24,711 --> 00:13:26,560
and he took it as well as can be.
I'll,

218
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:31,120
we'll see what happens when I
get back to work. But again,

219
00:13:31,121 --> 00:13:35,260
you go into it with, with
as much grace and, um,

220
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,590
and just generosity, you
know, I want to help him.

221
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:45,360
So your role was created to help preserve
[inaudible] culture while it grows

222
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:48,970
rapidly. We know a little bit
about that here at Google.

223
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,680
What are, um, what are the elements of,

224
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:58,770
is culture that you most fear losing
as you continue to expand and scale?

225
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:00,910
Yeah.
So yeah,

226
00:14:00,911 --> 00:14:05,000
the role was this role was created to
scale Gary and he says to scale the

227
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,810
unscalable, which I think is a
phenomenal way to say it. I mean,

228
00:14:07,811 --> 00:14:10,660
how do we scale culture?
That's the big question.

229
00:14:10,661 --> 00:14:13,570
It's a question I get all the time in
a question. I'm sure you guys get it.

230
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,290
Almost 80,000 people and,

231
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:18,730
and wanting to maintain
Google across the world.

232
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:25,020
So our culture is really built on a few
different values that I can say over the

233
00:14:25,271 --> 00:14:29,770
last eight and a half years are
pretty tried and true empathy,

234
00:14:29,771 --> 00:14:33,220
which I will call heart speed,

235
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,050
which I would call hustle,

236
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:39,070
hustle and heart possibility.

237
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,730
We work for an entrepreneur and
everything really is possible.

238
00:14:42,731 --> 00:14:45,220
There is a yes all the
time until there isn't,

239
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:49,650
but it takes a very long time to
get to the know if, if ever, um,

240
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,290
positivity. I mean, Gary
overindexes as an optimist,

241
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:58,640
I'm probably very close
behind him. And, um,

242
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,770
and winning competitiveness.

243
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:05,960
And those are things I believe are still
in our DNA absolutely over eight and a

244
00:15:05,961 --> 00:15:09,980
half years. But those are things that we
need to continue to stoke the fire on.

245
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,100
So for example, let's take the
conversation that I just had.

246
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:18,550
That conversation was out of line and out
of touch with our culture because the,

247
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,510
the,
the winning was misguided.

248
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:25,220
The wanting to win was miss w the
wanting to win was, was Cayston fear.

249
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:28,100
That's not one of our values.
It's not how we,

250
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:32,840
how we use and foster our culture.
And so,

251
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,020
you know, and that's just talking
to one individual. Where is that?

252
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,090
Is that spread anywhere? I mean, so, um,

253
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:42,770
the most important thing that I'm doing
every single day is I'm talking to a lot

254
00:15:42,771 --> 00:15:43,610
of people.
Quite frankly,

255
00:15:43,611 --> 00:15:47,210
I'm listening to a lot of people
and I'm just collecting data,

256
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:51,200
collecting information.
I'm holding space to see what happens,

257
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:56,030
to see what comes out. And as I'm
speaking to people and collecting data,

258
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:00,740
I'm looking for patterns and I'm looking
to hear if I hear a similarity on one

259
00:16:00,741 --> 00:16:04,160
certain team or if I hear a
similarity on a department,

260
00:16:04,161 --> 00:16:06,320
even though the department
might be in a different country,

261
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,180
it might have legs in a different culture,

262
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:11,740
a different company start
different country. Um,

263
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:13,520
and so as I hear these patterns,

264
00:16:13,521 --> 00:16:18,521
that's where we start to
deploy more people that are
what I like to call culture

265
00:16:18,531 --> 00:16:21,410
carriers.
By no means as the title culture carrier,

266
00:16:21,411 --> 00:16:23,670
although they should put it
in their signature, right?

267
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,550
These are people that really get,
uh,

268
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,480
but get a sense of the water that
we're drinking every single day.

269
00:16:29,481 --> 00:16:34,220
It's not Koolaid, it's water, it's
pure, it's real, you know. Um,

270
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:38,240
and so in every office and certainly
in our offices here in New York,

271
00:16:38,241 --> 00:16:40,070
which we have to, um, I've,

272
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:44,620
I can depend on and rely on using and,

273
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,960
and asking that person or that person or
that person to go take that person for

274
00:16:50,061 --> 00:16:54,110
a walk or for a cup of coffee or go
have a little mini town hall with those

275
00:16:54,111 --> 00:16:57,110
eight people who are just kind of crusty.
Um,

276
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:01,010
so that is something that is it
tea? It's like 24, seven job.

277
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:05,960
It's an absolute 24, seven job, which, um,
you know, meeting with people one on one,

278
00:17:05,961 --> 00:17:08,290
having hangouts with people going,
you know,

279
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:12,290
I'll start a big round of office visits
next week in different countries and

280
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:13,130
different cities.

281
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:16,730
And so making sure that we have that
high touch at every single moment.

282
00:17:16,731 --> 00:17:18,860
Obviously Gary is doing
the same exact thing.

283
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,850
He might be doing five minute meetings,
he might be doing a lot of texting,

284
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:28,270
but we try to cover and h and cover
as much ground as we possibly can.

285
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:29,750
And,
uh,

286
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:34,750
ensuring that the culture is still being
fed and fed and watered and so that we

287
00:17:36,081 --> 00:17:40,880
can, we can have like new sprouts every
single day. I talk in metaphors a lot,

288
00:17:40,881 --> 00:17:43,430
but that's what it looks like to me.
Quite frankly.

289
00:17:43,431 --> 00:17:47,360
It's 800 people now I
think 805 people I think.

290
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,730
And it's a lot.
It's just a lot of heartbeats.

291
00:17:50,731 --> 00:17:54,990
It's a lot of mouths to feed and
certainly don't need to explain that to,

292
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,980
to Google. But um, so we've got,
we've got a lot of learning to do,

293
00:17:58,981 --> 00:18:01,070
but I do think that we've
implemented some, um,

294
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,910
some really good a tried and tested um,
abilities now.

295
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:08,520
Yup. Are there, in the run up to 800,

296
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:13,370
are there things that you feel like
you've sort of lost irretrievably? Um,

297
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,360
or,
or things that just couldn't,

298
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:20,430
couldn't survive from the smaller
scale to the larger scale?

299
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,100
I don't think we lost them. I think we
lost sight of them and then got them back.

300
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:29,180
That's what I think. So in terms
of growing, growing, growing,

301
00:18:29,181 --> 00:18:32,570
and that's just for example, like the,
the talent team that's here. I mean they,

302
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,140
they,

303
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:36,830
there was a period of time and there's
only about five of them in all different

304
00:18:36,831 --> 00:18:41,000
countries and New York, we've
got three, uh, three or four. Um,

305
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,910
but there was a time that they
were hiring hand over fist. I mean,

306
00:18:43,911 --> 00:18:48,680
we couldn't bring enough bodies
into the offices and into our world.

307
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:53,600
And what we lost sight of was training
in what we lost sight of was the

308
00:18:53,601 --> 00:18:54,470
orientation.

309
00:18:55,010 --> 00:19:00,010
And what we ended up doing is throwing
them into a fire without giving them a

310
00:19:00,081 --> 00:19:03,520
sense of what's in our DNA,
what's in our, what's in our,

311
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:08,000
our bloodstream and our water.
And, um, there were moments,

312
00:19:08,001 --> 00:19:10,370
I would say in the last 18 months,
two years,

313
00:19:10,371 --> 00:19:15,371
that you could feel the
ground start to not tremble,

314
00:19:15,801 --> 00:19:17,690
but just start to shake a little bit.

315
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,690
Or the wheels on the bus just
start to rattle a little bit,

316
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,820
a little harder than I like. I like a lot
of speed, but it was a little much. Um,

317
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:27,650
and in those moments it's,
you know,

318
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,130
that's something that I talked to Gary
about and we talked to my team about and

319
00:19:31,131 --> 00:19:33,680
we have to kind of do a full
court press in that moment.

320
00:19:33,681 --> 00:19:36,950
There's some things that we're not
going to be able to retrofit and change.

321
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:40,820
But going forward, we know how
important it is to Orient, you know,

322
00:19:40,821 --> 00:19:45,821
we have a week long orientation and how
important it is for that employee to

323
00:19:46,971 --> 00:19:51,050
really, really connect, get a
sense of belonging, tried and true.

324
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:55,100
We want them here. You know, we've gone
through three rounds of interviewing,

325
00:19:55,101 --> 00:19:57,170
maybe four.
And so when they come in,

326
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,580
we already have this incredible sense of
belief in them and it takes an employee

327
00:20:01,581 --> 00:20:06,350
obviously a longer time to believe in the
org. But in those cases where we were,

328
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:10,240
we got lost a little bit. And so,
um, anyway, we've retrofitted.

329
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:15,440
And are there things that you find that
you can do at scale that you couldn't do,

330
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,790
uh,
when you were smaller?

331
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:20,920
That I actually believe in terms
of going back in time a little bit

332
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,270
back in time. It's not the right way to
say it because we can't go back in time,

333
00:20:25,271 --> 00:20:29,710
but we can certainly go back and have
that conversation with that swath of

334
00:20:29,711 --> 00:20:34,030
people that we may have
missed. Um, we moved to a,

335
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:38,230
we opened up our first international
office about 15 months ago in London.

336
00:20:38,231 --> 00:20:42,780
And in doing so, we sent out x
paths to open up the office. Uh,

337
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:45,600
one of the things we
learned very quickly is an,

338
00:20:45,601 --> 00:20:48,880
and I worked in London for for
a significant amount of time,

339
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:51,400
so it's something I knew,
but as an ex pat,

340
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,080
it's different with different glasses on.
Um,

341
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:57,940
it's so important to get locals in your
office and get locals in your office

342
00:20:57,941 --> 00:20:58,774
fast.

343
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:03,550
Otherwise it really is like the
American invasion in many ways.

344
00:21:03,551 --> 00:21:06,700
And that's not gonna work. That's
not going to work in another country,

345
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,470
but it's certainly not
going to work when you,

346
00:21:08,471 --> 00:21:12,340
when you are a local and you walk in
and there's eight x paths and they're

347
00:21:12,341 --> 00:21:13,420
telling you what to do.

348
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:17,350
So those are things that
we've had to look at and,

349
00:21:17,351 --> 00:21:19,840
and reverse engineer as we go forward.

350
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:27,790
So, uh, we're just finishing
up our performance management
and compensation cycle.

351
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:31,270
Uh, African every company has
them in some form or another. Um,

352
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:35,290
but those processes, performance
management, compensation planning, um,

353
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:40,560
they're often seen as sort of
being directly at odds with uh,

354
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,680
the effort to create psychological safety,
a culture of trust.

355
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:49,980
How do you handle performance evaluation
and rewards without undermining the,

356
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,990
the honey empire? It's so
tough. I mean this crew right in

357
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:56,390
front of me that,
that uh,

358
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:59,780
that's on my team is and they're the ones
that take a little bit of the bruising.

359
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:04,880
Um, because there is such a juxtaposition
between we love you, we believe in you.

360
00:22:04,881 --> 00:22:07,520
We want you, you have a home,
we want you here forever.

361
00:22:07,521 --> 00:22:12,521
Here's 6% or you just got
all fives on a review,

362
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:17,720
on a review form. Cause we just got
out of our cycle as well. And uh,

363
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:22,070
but you're not getting, you're not
getting promoted, but here's 10%.

364
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,440
These are really hard conversations.

365
00:22:24,441 --> 00:22:29,441
I don't have the answer other than so
much high touch and that means you know,

366
00:22:30,081 --> 00:22:32,900
spending time with that employee,
going back to that employee,

367
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,280
letting them know we work
for them, working with their
manager, seeing how we can,

368
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,750
you know, if, if, if we're
not able to give them the um,

369
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:46,430
the salary increase that they were so
hoping for and it is 6% or it is 8% making

370
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:49,880
sure that what's in their review in terms
of their training and development or

371
00:22:49,881 --> 00:22:53,780
their growth plans, we are hitting
immediately or as soon as we possibly can.

372
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:54,250
That's,

373
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:59,250
that's one way I think that
we can surround that person
or that cohort with as

374
00:22:59,691 --> 00:23:02,630
much heart,
as much honey as we possibly can.

375
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,440
Spending time with Gary is always going
to be a benefit and it's weird to kind

376
00:23:06,441 --> 00:23:08,120
of dangle that in front sometimes,

377
00:23:08,121 --> 00:23:13,121
but it is so incredibly helpful when you
get that time with Gary and he's able

378
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:18,980
to, in his own words, really,

379
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:23,390
really hone you into the vision because
the vision is, the vision is amazing.

380
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:25,640
Like the,
the vision of what we're doing.

381
00:23:25,641 --> 00:23:30,320
We're building an agency so that at some
point in time we can buy brands and,

382
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:33,800
and own them and create the
marketing and awareness for them.

383
00:23:33,801 --> 00:23:38,600
Like that's awesome that there's not a
lot of agencies that are doing that. Um,

384
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,380
but it is, um, it's something
we need to spend a lot of time,

385
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:46,100
a lot of time with and a lot of,
um, not coddling and not pampering,

386
00:23:46,101 --> 00:23:49,670
but just again, high touch. I
say that I say that phrase a lot,

387
00:23:49,671 --> 00:23:51,840
but it is really what we do,
um,

388
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:56,710
from a resident on up to an SVP.
Hmm.

389
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:01,910
And in line with fat as,
as chief heart officer,

390
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:03,560
how do you,

391
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,560
how do you go about helping someone when
they're not succeeding in their role?

392
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,700
So when they're not
succeeding in their role,

393
00:24:09,701 --> 00:24:14,020
we do as much of a three 60 as we can
first and foremost to find out is that

394
00:24:14,021 --> 00:24:18,250
really true or is that just that one
person or that one manager from the top

395
00:24:18,251 --> 00:24:21,730
down? That's like rabbi, Rabbi back
because that's not fair. Right?

396
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:24,460
So we really try to look at it in a,

397
00:24:24,461 --> 00:24:27,700
in a holistic manner and get as
much three 60 as we possibly can.

398
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:33,070
We put people on performance plans
30 day, 60 days, sometimes 90 day,

399
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:36,430
um, in, in London. We
will extend that notice.

400
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:41,410
We will extend that a 90 day trial period
if we need to for another three months.

401
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,600
We want people to be successful again.

402
00:24:43,601 --> 00:24:46,570
We've invested so much time
as you do too in recruiting,

403
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:50,250
finding that right talent,
bringing them in orientation.

404
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:54,850
I mean it costs a lot of money. Also talk
about the empire, you know, it's when,

405
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:57,190
so when you lose an employee,
it customers doubled,

406
00:24:57,191 --> 00:24:58,990
tripled to get that next employee in.

407
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:04,450
So making sure that we're
giving them very specific,

408
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:09,280
clear ways in which to
improve is that's our job.

409
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:14,110
Actionable, measurable,
ways to improve. Otherwise,

410
00:25:14,111 --> 00:25:17,980
like that's not fair, you know? So
we spend a lot of time doing that.

411
00:25:17,981 --> 00:25:20,410
We don't have a lot of
people on performance plans.

412
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:25,480
I don't know if that's a good or a bad
thing. Maybe we're not looking at, uh,

413
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,250
looking deep enough.
But for the most part,

414
00:25:27,251 --> 00:25:29,770
I think coming out of this
review cycle right now,

415
00:25:29,771 --> 00:25:33,430
I can say that it's a very low
percentage and we're doing our best to,

416
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:38,760
to get people to get the seize up to
a B and to get the bees up to an a.

417
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,880
One of the things that we do have that
I'm super proud of is we have this alumni

418
00:25:42,881 --> 00:25:45,250
program.
So if someone,

419
00:25:45,251 --> 00:25:48,820
if we have a c that we know
will be in a somewhere else,

420
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:51,190
or if we have some of
those just not working out,

421
00:25:51,191 --> 00:25:54,970
we're just not the right culture for
example. Or we just moved too fast,

422
00:25:55,270 --> 00:26:00,270
we will do our very best as we let them
go to find their next interview to find

423
00:26:01,151 --> 00:26:04,930
their next role. And so we can do that
based on Gary's network of course,

424
00:26:04,931 --> 00:26:08,690
and getting and based on
the enormous amount of, um,

425
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:13,240
job requests he's getting in every single
day. Like, Hey, do you have a, Hey,

426
00:26:13,241 --> 00:26:17,080
do you have a, and so we'll do our best
to do the networking and then set them,

427
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,730
set them up with that first interview.

428
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:25,480
So, um, one of the things
that I think we're, um,

429
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:30,640
we, we've noted in our culture and
that and that we're struggling with is

430
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,900
how do you, how do you
make a manager, right?

431
00:26:34,901 --> 00:26:39,400
How do you take somebody who's a
tremendous performer as an individual

432
00:26:39,401 --> 00:26:41,080
contributor,
um,

433
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:46,380
and either determined that they should
or shouldn't be a manager and then make

434
00:26:47,251 --> 00:26:48,990
sure they have the manager skill sets,

435
00:26:48,991 --> 00:26:53,220
which are actually generally
very different from the
skill sets that made them

436
00:26:53,221 --> 00:26:57,160
successful as an individual contributor.
Um, what, what's your approach to,

437
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:01,020
to making managers?
So

438
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:06,130
we are in the process of figuring out
that training. I'll tell you, unlike,

439
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:11,020
uh, I should say not, not
unsimilar to many agencies,

440
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,020
you get promoted,

441
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:17,290
you just rise through a ladder and you
just get maybe like a higher salary and

442
00:27:17,291 --> 00:27:18,340
more responsibility.

443
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:22,600
But there isn't a lot of manager
training and agencies probably due to the

444
00:27:22,601 --> 00:27:26,680
nature of our work now it's incredibly
fast where the service of clients,

445
00:27:26,681 --> 00:27:29,590
we have an output. Thank you
very much. So forth and so on.

446
00:27:29,591 --> 00:27:31,270
And You keep on going on and on and on.

447
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:36,040
Management management training is
something we kicked off in January in

448
00:27:36,041 --> 00:27:38,380
difference in different
forms. And that, that, uh,

449
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,300
that included our presentation training
that included a radical candor feedback

450
00:27:43,301 --> 00:27:48,220
training that is now including,
um, a facilitation training.

451
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:53,740
But we are still figuring
out what is the right, what,

452
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:58,720
what does a Vayner media manager
recognizing that we want everyone to have

453
00:27:58,721 --> 00:28:03,700
uniqueness and how do we go about having
that training? How do we go about,

454
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:07,850
is it one on one? I mean, obviously
experiential is the way to do for, for,

455
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:12,280
for I believe that we learn
faster when we experience it.

456
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,500
We either teach it or we experienced it.

457
00:28:14,501 --> 00:28:17,730
So we're developing those
things right now. And, um,

458
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:22,690
I absolutely wish I had a magic wand and
we could make that happen faster. But,

459
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:23,860
um,

460
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:28,590
but spending time with people and really
figuring out what makes them beat,

461
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,300
what makes them tick,
kind of figure it,

462
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:34,690
helping them figure out kind of their
own human behavior so that they can be

463
00:28:34,691 --> 00:28:37,900
that much more tuned into others,
I think is the key there.

464
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:43,330
All right. Um, I have a
couple more questions,

465
00:28:43,331 --> 00:28:48,040
but I want to take a minute and just see
if there are questions in the audience

466
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,050
that,
yeah.

467
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:57,110
Hi. Hi. Um,

468
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:01,670
something that is so important.
Yeah.

469
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,660
I think hard to manage for a lot of
people that I know that you've done having

470
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:09,110
worked with you before really well is one,

471
00:29:09,111 --> 00:29:11,590
found your passion and then secondly,

472
00:29:11,591 --> 00:29:15,800
you found a way to get there.
Um,

473
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:19,430
I would just love, and I know you
mentor a lot of people in that way too.

474
00:29:19,431 --> 00:29:22,550
I'd love to hear your perspective on that.

475
00:29:22,551 --> 00:29:27,551
Tips and tricks of how you kind of found
value in this and navigated your way.

476
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:31,790
Thanks, Carrie. Yeah,

477
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:35,720
and I've worked, worked with each
other about 13 or 15 years ago,

478
00:29:35,721 --> 00:29:39,800
so thanks for being the
first question. Yeah. Um,

479
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:45,340
so I love doing coaching
and I love mentoring and,
um, and throughout my years,

480
00:29:45,341 --> 00:29:48,910
whether or not I was at this company or
that agency or running my own surfing

481
00:29:48,911 --> 00:29:53,020
company, um, I've picked up a
lot of positive psychology, uh,

482
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:54,930
tips and tricks along the way and,

483
00:29:54,931 --> 00:29:59,290
and Life Coaching and executive
coaching tools. And I, I,

484
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,290
I do a lot of coaching.
I called them white sessions.

485
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:05,630
Some people might call them
northstar sessions, but, um,

486
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:10,690
what I find is most important with,
with all people and all human beings,

487
00:30:10,691 --> 00:30:14,200
is making sure that at some
point in our existence,

488
00:30:14,201 --> 00:30:18,880
we were able to define
and touch our purpose,

489
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:21,520
our passion and our purpose
could be very different.

490
00:30:21,521 --> 00:30:23,350
My one of my passions is snowboarding,

491
00:30:23,351 --> 00:30:27,080
but my purpose has nothing
to do with snowboarding. Um,

492
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:32,530
so there's a difference there. But, um,
so I take people through value, values,

493
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:36,010
exercises. Uh, I really like
people to be big in the room.

494
00:30:36,011 --> 00:30:37,210
That's something I say a lot.

495
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:39,970
So when they're with me and
they're in one of these 45 minute,

496
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:43,540
hour long sessions, what I say to them,
it's like, it's just us in the room.

497
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:47,320
So it'd be big. Like, tell me really,
what is the value you bring to teams?

498
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:51,940
Like no one's listening, just you and
me. Uh, then I'll look at their values.

499
00:30:51,941 --> 00:30:54,670
Sometimes I even asked them what
they wanted to be when they,

500
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,530
when they were kids,
what do they want to be when they grew up?

501
00:30:56,531 --> 00:30:59,290
Because I think when we go
back to the origin of time,

502
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:02,320
when we were just innocent and we
wanted it to be an astronaut or a film

503
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:05,390
director or whatnot, there's
a lot of truth in that. Um,

504
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:07,210
and sometimes there's still threads.

505
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,750
There's still like a red thread that
runs through from when you were a kid to

506
00:31:10,751 --> 00:31:14,410
when you're an adult. Um,
I really ask people to,

507
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,950
it's a funny little corny question,
but to think about

508
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,750
in their most innocent of times,
brushing their teeth in the morning,

509
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:26,870
just who are they? Like, what
is, what is, what are they,
where's the resonance? What,

510
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:31,510
you know, are they, are they mad? Are they
like, when you wake up in the morning,

511
00:31:31,511 --> 00:31:34,720
who are you, what, what type
of person are you? And then I,

512
00:31:34,721 --> 00:31:38,650
so all of that together and we hopefully
we land on a guiding principle or a

513
00:31:38,651 --> 00:31:43,370
mission statement, something that they
are really proud of and they can own.

514
00:31:43,371 --> 00:31:45,970
And they put, I say, you know, put
that in your wallet or, you know,

515
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:49,090
put that on your laptop. Um, because it's,

516
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,360
it's unique to each and every individual.
And I really think that once, you know,

517
00:31:52,361 --> 00:31:56,360
if I, if we're successful in this,
might take three sessions with them. Um,

518
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:59,680
they go back to their desk and they
can use some of that with other people.

519
00:31:59,681 --> 00:32:03,220
I mean, that's how I see it. That's
how I'm scaling myself, quite frankly,

520
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:04,300
aside from the team,

521
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,950
if I'm having this incredible
interaction with another human being,

522
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:11,650
that they're going back to their desk,
their team,

523
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,210
their cohort, and they're able to, you
know, sprinkle their own magic dust,

524
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:20,620
you know, and that way
that we just, the, I mean,

525
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:24,520
the good vibes just keep, keep, keep
on going. But, um, that's what I do.

526
00:32:24,521 --> 00:32:27,760
I just spend a lot of time
doing a lot of coaching and, um,

527
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:32,030
and just like creating space for people
to just be whomever they want. You know,

528
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:36,130
at Vaynermedia,
and I wouldn't doubt at Google as well.

529
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:41,130
We're teaching a lot more
than just fundamental skills
of how to use ad manager

530
00:32:41,781 --> 00:32:45,260
or how did you know how to be an
incredible client service person.

531
00:32:45,261 --> 00:32:48,980
I mean it's life skills. So
now, yes, you can teach empathy,

532
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,410
someone has to be interested
and open to learning.

533
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:54,410
You can teach self awareness
and those types of things.

534
00:32:54,411 --> 00:32:59,180
So I think that's what juices me every
single day that I don't have to just,

535
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:02,140
I'm not just talking about,
um,

536
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:07,220
how to get this bottle into more
hands, you know, talking about why,

537
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,680
why would you even be interested in
getting this bottle into more hands? Hmm.

538
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:15,100
I've another question. Yeah.
Hi. Thanks for being here. Um,

539
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:19,400
I had an opportunity to see Arie speak
for the first time like two weeks ago at

540
00:33:19,401 --> 00:33:23,810
a conference. Um, and as you all know
who probably worked for him, he has the,

541
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:26,600
uh,
energy and ability to kind of,

542
00:33:26,601 --> 00:33:31,460
might drop on the whole room and make
people like kind of silence after I want

543
00:33:31,461 --> 00:33:34,850
to be a part of what he's
doing or like it's so, um,

544
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:39,500
just engaging. So my question is
kind of on the recruiting process.

545
00:33:39,501 --> 00:33:44,501
Do you guys find that a
lot of your applicants come
from like Gary v lovers who

546
00:33:45,651 --> 00:33:48,380
just are a huge fan of him
and want to work for him?

547
00:33:48,381 --> 00:33:52,430
Or like maybe even some of the recruiters
in the room who work at Vayner?

548
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:55,640
Like what is your guys's process?
Do you reach out?

549
00:33:55,641 --> 00:33:58,790
Do you have a bunch of
people like that who apply?

550
00:33:58,791 --> 00:34:01,040
I can only imagine
after hearing him speak.

551
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:05,810
So just wanted to know kind of what the
recruiting process looks like for you

552
00:34:05,811 --> 00:34:06,644
guys.
Cool.

553
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:11,550
Keep me, keep me honest team.
But um, he's, he's absolutely,

554
00:34:11,551 --> 00:34:16,340
in fact he's contagious. I mean that
energy and the mic drop and the,

555
00:34:16,341 --> 00:34:19,110
and the realism of him is like
something you just want to be around.

556
00:34:19,111 --> 00:34:23,310
Cause there's not many people out there
like him, uh, at least that are um,

557
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:28,830
that you see their content every
single day in every single way. So we,

558
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:31,260
I would say it's, it's split.
We obviously, you know,

559
00:34:31,261 --> 00:34:34,380
we hire for skill set fit
and a culture edition.

560
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:38,670
If you wanted to Gary's inbox right now,
you would see,

561
00:34:38,671 --> 00:34:41,910
I'm sure probably 300 people that are
like, I will work for you for free.

562
00:34:41,911 --> 00:34:44,160
And that might have just
happened in the last eight hours.

563
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,380
By the time we get to
eight o'clock tonight,

564
00:34:46,381 --> 00:34:50,160
there might be another hundred and 50
that just want to work for us for free,

565
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:54,240
which is, that is amazing. I just
like incredible and an honor.

566
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,010
Are those people the right
skillset? I Dunno. You know,

567
00:34:59,011 --> 00:35:02,820
and that's where we have to start calling
through some of those cvs if we get,

568
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:08,060
now we have specific recruiters
that are looking at just media,

569
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,570
video production account,
project management and whatnot.

570
00:35:12,571 --> 00:35:16,320
Every now and then we'll get sent one
of these people to have these people.

571
00:35:16,321 --> 00:35:20,940
Or Hey, you know, the owner
of the new, uh, the New York
jets has a son. Here you go.

572
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:26,290
Um, we have, uh, so we, we have to look
through those incredibly carefully.

573
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,870
Of course we'll give someone not an at
bat or at an interview, that's for sure.

574
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:35,580
If they are a student will help, hopefully
get them into our internship program,

575
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,490
which is in the summer.
If are just coming out of university,

576
00:35:38,491 --> 00:35:42,150
maybe we can get them in as a
resident. Again, the skills are super,

577
00:35:42,151 --> 00:35:46,830
super important because we move so fast.
It's, it's not charity, as Gary would say.

578
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:51,060
He says a lot. It's just like,
I mean, what are we doing
here? Like we're working,

579
00:35:51,061 --> 00:35:55,080
we're here to work. We're here to, we are
here to hustle and to be the, you know,

580
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:59,690
the biggest human, uh, human agency
in the face of the earth. But, um,

581
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,880
we really need to take our time and
go through those cvs and that's,

582
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,350
that takes a lot of time.

583
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:07,680
And then we have to make sure that we're
interviewing really, really carefully.

584
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:11,650
Otherwise we could just get a, you
know, a lot of Gary fanatics and,

585
00:36:11,651 --> 00:36:14,970
and maybe not a lot of the specific
work that we need to get done,

586
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:19,830
but it's always fun to see those
emails come in. A lot of fun.

587
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:25,240
Chairman. Hi Erin. Hi.
Question for you. Um,

588
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:29,120
as Vayner media focuses on building
a honey empire or it more of the work

589
00:36:29,121 --> 00:36:33,650
environment that has more heart
involved in getting more comfortable and

590
00:36:33,651 --> 00:36:37,010
connected with your employees to make
them more productive. And as you know,

591
00:36:37,011 --> 00:36:39,830
Google completely sense
itself in that way as well.

592
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:43,860
And where we're culture is huge.
Diversity is very important for us, um,

593
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:47,370
for the benefit of our team and employees.
Um,

594
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:52,940
can you talk about a time where
you using your approach towards,

595
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,830
um,
connecting with your employees that have,

596
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:57,950
that have made them more
productive and so you can say, yes,

597
00:36:57,951 --> 00:37:00,280
this is something more scalable.
And,

598
00:37:00,281 --> 00:37:04,530
and do you implore other companies or
other agencies for that matter, um,

599
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:08,060
to kind of employ employed
that approach as well?

600
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:12,550
Yeah. So let's see if I'm, if I'm
tracking correctly, what I, what I,

601
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,140
what I think you're asking is

602
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:19,400
a little bit of the training that
we do with our employees that are,

603
00:37:19,401 --> 00:37:23,690
is basically kind of geared a little
bit towards the performance and their

604
00:37:23,691 --> 00:37:27,440
success. So you know, the
honey and the empire portion,

605
00:37:27,441 --> 00:37:30,230
maybe like looking at this or looking
at what I was talking about in the

606
00:37:30,231 --> 00:37:33,380
beginning, which was putting
people first and if you really,

607
00:37:33,381 --> 00:37:37,790
really hone in and deploy as much empathy
and care and Tlc and generosity and

608
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:41,640
giving to employees that the output is,
I mean you,

609
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:45,230
you just get 10 fold more of the output.
Um,

610
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:48,150
so we do a lot of, we, we,

611
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:52,580
we spend time doing a lot of small
town halls, size of this room,

612
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,790
uh, town halls where I
will be, I will just take,

613
00:37:55,791 --> 00:37:59,120
I will field questions that
come at me about our culture,

614
00:37:59,121 --> 00:38:01,250
about changes or more transparency.

615
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,900
I'll do that because I fundamentally
believe we need more communication

616
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,100
throughout the agency.

617
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:10,820
And I should say I started at the
agency as the SVP on the client side.

618
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:16,640
And so I can fully remember for
those 18 months I was there. I was,

619
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,370
I was thinking, Gosh, we need more
communication from leadership.

620
00:38:19,371 --> 00:38:22,190
We need more communication
from leadership. And now
that I'm in leadership,

621
00:38:22,191 --> 00:38:24,350
it's something that I
think about all the time.

622
00:38:24,351 --> 00:38:26,480
How can we increase our transparency?

623
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:31,790
How can we make sure that we're delivering
on the promise of the honey empire?

624
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:36,280
How can we, how can we make
sure that we're delivering
that and development that,

625
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:41,170
um, that we, that we also promised?
So spending time with people is super,

626
00:38:41,171 --> 00:38:46,120
super important. I've already said that,
but, um, making sure that I'm coming in,

627
00:38:46,121 --> 00:38:50,390
you know, it's, it's funny,
so much of what I do,

628
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:53,950
it comes so naturally to me.
And that's the great thing because I'm,

629
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:57,940
I'm living my purpose to caries
to Carrie's question. I'm able to,

630
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:01,160
my purpose is to fill this,
facilitate growth and change and,

631
00:39:01,161 --> 00:39:06,100
and people and companies and teams and
be a team builder and be of service.

632
00:39:06,101 --> 00:39:07,840
And I'm able to do that every single day.

633
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:12,380
But I realized not everyone
is able to do that. So, um,

634
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:15,190
me showing that I think
it's really important that,

635
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:18,160
that everyone knows that I work for them.
No one,

636
00:39:18,161 --> 00:39:21,140
there's absolutely no one
that works for me. Um,

637
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:25,150
and I will give whatever I possibly can
to help someone over that finish line or

638
00:39:25,151 --> 00:39:29,220
help someone from the 10 yard line
to the 30 yard line, yard line. Um,

639
00:39:29,221 --> 00:39:31,210
and that takes a lot of
time and energy and effort.

640
00:39:31,211 --> 00:39:34,780
But I think that's the wonderful
thing about being in a company,

641
00:39:34,781 --> 00:39:37,810
especially run by Gary where, you know,
he wants to buy the New York jets.

642
00:39:37,811 --> 00:39:39,730
And so we function as a team in many,

643
00:39:39,731 --> 00:39:43,570
many ways and making sure that
we're deploying to your point,

644
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:48,490
deploying as much of that honey
and the empire, uh, internally and,

645
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,790
and hopefully there's a trickle
on effect in other companies.

646
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:55,390
Yeah. Yeah. Um,

647
00:39:55,810 --> 00:40:00,810
how do you scale that you go back
afterwards and are you able to scale that

648
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:05,440
dynamic to say this actually works and
it's actually making our employees more

649
00:40:05,441 --> 00:40:08,220
productive? How do you scale that? Yeah,

650
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:13,540
the scaling question is such a great
question for us. I think at this size,

651
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:18,520
at the 800 mark, um, because
as I look out on the,

652
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,470
on the landscape,
it's not any,

653
00:40:20,471 --> 00:40:23,320
it's not anything I'm going to
be able to do alone. And it's,

654
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:25,630
and it's something that
my team can certainly do,

655
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:30,070
but they're going to need
extra reinforcements very,

656
00:40:30,071 --> 00:40:34,980
very soon because we can't be in every
place at every single time. And, uh,

657
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:39,360
in order to track back and see how that
employee or that cohort of people as a,

658
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:42,520
you know, if there are,
um, move, if, if they're,

659
00:40:42,521 --> 00:40:46,180
if they're needle has moved since we
last trained with them or we lost spent

660
00:40:46,181 --> 00:40:46,930
time with them,

661
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:50,860
it takes a lot of time and energy and
it takes away from something else that

662
00:40:50,861 --> 00:40:55,840
we're doing that might be
extremely pressing. Um, so
it's, it's really, I, you know,

663
00:40:55,841 --> 00:41:00,430
leaning on the culture carriers that
we've built right now to kind of be the

664
00:41:00,431 --> 00:41:05,050
finger on the pulse for me when
I can't be there or for Gary. Um,

665
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,620
and making sure that we can track back
and there is something to measure.

666
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:13,100
But growth is something that we can, we
can feel, I mean, you can see it in the,

667
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:15,160
you can see it in the water,
you can feel it,

668
00:41:15,161 --> 00:41:16,930
you can certainly feel it
when you're with someone.

669
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,900
And especially because we
have people that stay with us,

670
00:41:19,901 --> 00:41:21,550
the longevity for a long time.

671
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:25,310
So you can see how they've EBD
and flown throughout their,

672
00:41:25,311 --> 00:41:30,250
their tenure ship at Vayner media.
And we really use them quite frankly,

673
00:41:30,251 --> 00:41:34,340
to help other people grow
and to make sure that we are,

674
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:36,980
um, going back and, and,

675
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:41,750
and I'm tying up any loose ends that
we may have missed. So it's really,

676
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:46,640
it's really a human, it's
really human effort. I mean,

677
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:50,720
thank God for Google and Google docs and
Google forms because that's what we run

678
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:55,550
on running. Um, it's, it's,
it's human effort. And, uh,

679
00:41:55,551 --> 00:41:57,470
at some point, you know,
we're starting to assist,

680
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:01,340
systematize much more now that we're
a, we passed the 700 people. Mark,

681
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:05,150
thanks for the question.
Okay.

682
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:13,930
Zoom out a little bit of the previous
question asked around diversity and

683
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:17,350
inclusion in two dimensions.
So one is,

684
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:21,640
especially in the creative side of the
agency, business diversity has been

685
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:28,840
a massive problem in this part of the
industry within LGBT people of color are

686
00:42:31,361 --> 00:42:33,340
dramatically underrepresented,

687
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:37,410
underrepresented in every creative agency,

688
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:39,940
every creative department
inside companies.

689
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:42,640
I'm wondering if you
could talk about your,

690
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,860
your point of view on sort of like how
you acquire that talent to you sort of

691
00:42:47,861 --> 00:42:50,350
have a specific lens for that or not.
Um,

692
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:55,360
and then something that I think it's very
personal to a lot of Googlers is also

693
00:42:55,361 --> 00:43:00,070
how once those people come in, um,
they do feel that sense of connection,

694
00:43:00,071 --> 00:43:04,210
trust and empathy so that think she'd
feel included and want to build that sense

695
00:43:04,211 --> 00:43:05,044
of loyalty.

696
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,340
Yeah.
Thank you for the question.

697
00:43:06,341 --> 00:43:10,270
It's actually one that I love
digging into because as you said,

698
00:43:10,271 --> 00:43:13,030
we're all trying to figure it out.
Um,

699
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:18,300
mapping the macro to the micro Mapi a
macrocosm to the microcosm is much more

700
00:43:19,721 --> 00:43:22,370
difficult than I would've ever known.
Um,

701
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,590
as I'm now looking at it from the top
down and also just like being on the floor

702
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:31,690
a diversity and inclusivity is,
and they are different things of course.

703
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,680
Um, it's one thing to have
I diverse employee, uh,

704
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:37,240
nasty if you will,

705
00:43:37,241 --> 00:43:41,350
but then to deploy inclusivity
and the belonging is,

706
00:43:41,351 --> 00:43:44,080
I think that's almost more challenging.

707
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:49,980
So one of the things that is extremely
important to us is creating a safe space

708
00:43:50,321 --> 00:43:53,410
where people feel that they can bring
their whole self stork and that means

709
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:57,880
physical safety and psychological
safety. Absolutely. Bar none.

710
00:43:57,881 --> 00:43:59,140
We were talking about this earlier,

711
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:04,000
it's like literally on my head every
single day when people were new,

712
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,520
when can't,
let's start with the candidate experience.

713
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:11,380
When you are a candidate and you walk
in and if you are a person of color and

714
00:44:11,381 --> 00:44:15,880
you aren't seeing any other people of
color, that is, that cannot feel good.

715
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:17,800
But there's just no way.

716
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,730
If you are a female and you
are being interviewed by males,

717
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,460
there's no way that feels good either.
So I mean that's,

718
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:28,360
that's just even talking about like a
white female of privilege, you know.

719
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:33,900
So making sure that we have as much
diversity out of in our office is in our

720
00:44:35,791 --> 00:44:36,870
offices is really,

721
00:44:36,871 --> 00:44:40,770
really fundamentally the most important
thing that we can do every single day.

722
00:44:40,771 --> 00:44:44,280
And that means hiring,
like hiring the best person.

723
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:48,120
Of course we're going to hire the best
person that comes our way. Skillset,

724
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,570
culture edition.

725
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:54,980
I like this idea of making sure or trying
to make sure that our values with that

726
00:44:55,351 --> 00:44:57,300
candidate and that candidate
or in the same zip code.

727
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,400
It's something I was just sharing
with the team the other day.

728
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:03,720
I don't expect your value in my value
to be completely apples to apples,

729
00:45:03,721 --> 00:45:08,721
but I would like them to be similar that
I think the value piece of it I think

730
00:45:09,421 --> 00:45:12,660
does open up the, um, uh, is a,

731
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:16,320
gives us a little bit more of an ability
to widen our net or cast a wider net

732
00:45:16,321 --> 00:45:19,490
when we are looking for those candidates.
Um,

733
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:23,580
back to creating a safe space where people
feel like they can bring their whole

734
00:45:23,581 --> 00:45:25,770
selves to work.
If you are a person of color,

735
00:45:25,771 --> 00:45:28,830
you want to see more people of color.
If you are Lgbtq,

736
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:32,190
you want to know that we have a private
group. If you have a learning disability,

737
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,840
are you dyslexic?
Like myself?

738
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:37,920
You want to know that we have tools
that you can use. Um, all, you know,

739
00:45:37,921 --> 00:45:39,240
if you have a physical handicap,

740
00:45:39,241 --> 00:45:44,220
like you want to be recognized for
that not as an other and an outlier,

741
00:45:44,221 --> 00:45:49,080
but that we can embrace you and,
and take care of that. So, um,

742
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,830
you know, the 3% conferences
going on right now up the street.

743
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:56,910
And one of the things I love about what
they've done there is they've called

744
00:45:56,911 --> 00:46:01,911
attention to the fact that diversity
is so few and far between and creative

745
00:46:02,371 --> 00:46:03,640
agencies.
Um,

746
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:07,710
the idea of finding that other,

747
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:12,420
especially on senior level creative
positions is really challenging.

748
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:15,510
It's really challenging for us. I'm
happy to say I don't have the, we don't,

749
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:20,190
we actually don't have stats
on multicultural diversity
because people can opt

750
00:46:20,191 --> 00:46:24,390
out of that question. So what makes
me happy is when I walk around,

751
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:29,190
when I walk across the floor
and I can see just difference.

752
00:46:29,191 --> 00:46:30,840
And I don't mean difference,
but the Max,

753
00:46:30,841 --> 00:46:35,590
I mean difference with a Capital d because
that's, this room is different. Um,

754
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:38,160
it's something that is just
so incredibly important. I,

755
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:39,890
I can't even stress that enough.
It is,

756
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,710
I don't want to even say it's my favorite
question to answer because I don't

757
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:47,990
have the answer, but is my favorite
thing to kind of chew on all together?

758
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:51,180
Um,
and you know,

759
00:46:51,181 --> 00:46:54,420
does that mean where we need to
learn lean in on the four d is more,

760
00:46:54,421 --> 00:46:55,440
do you mean there's,
there's,

761
00:46:55,470 --> 00:46:59,730
there's pockets in the city and pockets
and Chattanooga and pockets in schools

762
00:46:59,731 --> 00:47:02,330
that we can lean on to
get different talent. Um,

763
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:05,340
it's something we certainly do with our
residents and our internship to really

764
00:47:05,341 --> 00:47:09,900
like make sure we're casting that wide
net and able to mirror the macrocosm of

765
00:47:09,901 --> 00:47:14,160
this, you know, this world. Um,
and it's something we haven't,

766
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,420
we haven't solved for yet.
It is a work in progress and uh,

767
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:22,800
but something that is so near and dear
to like what I'm doing back to Gary,

768
00:47:22,801 --> 00:47:23,730
like what are we doing here?

769
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:28,730
Like we have to make sure that we are
finding talent that represents this world.

770
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:35,610
You know, and one of the
things I'm proud of that, uh,

771
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:39,310
back at work is that we have squads,
we used to call them tribes in fact,

772
00:47:39,311 --> 00:47:43,330
and we took away that word tribes
because of the cultural sensitivity.

773
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:48,040
But we have squads and I like to use
the word cohorts quite a bit. Um,

774
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:52,360
and there was a squad that is called
the Amigos squad and they found it each

775
00:47:52,361 --> 00:47:55,960
other. They found each other. They
founded this group first and foremost,

776
00:47:55,961 --> 00:48:00,610
to be able to market to a Latinas
and Latinos and the Hispanic culture.

777
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,820
And now they've really a,
there, it's an inclusive,

778
00:48:03,821 --> 00:48:05,830
it's an open door group and
it's an inclusive group.

779
00:48:05,831 --> 00:48:10,800
But it's one that keeps me very, very
honest about what we're doing, about, uh,

780
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:15,470
diversity and inclusivity. And, um, so
I'm happy. I'm happy. We have that and a,

781
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:19,630
and a and still a startup quite frankly.
So thank you for the question.

782
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:23,460
And I'm open to any ideas,
uh,

783
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:27,970
to chomp on for, you know, how
we solve this. Yeah. Thank you

784
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,740
Tom. Passionate about that. Yeah, come on.

785
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,430
So,
um,

786
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:41,090
if you're successful in making your
workplace a place where people feel

787
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:45,630
included, feel at home, um, what's
your approach to work life balance?

788
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:47,930
How do you make sure that, uh, you know,

789
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:52,590
is there a danger of tipping that too
far where some people might fail to a

790
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:54,840
build or maintain their
life outside of work?

791
00:48:55,720 --> 00:49:00,670
So the sarcastic me says to you, is
there such a thing as work life balance?

792
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:05,620
I mean sarcastic and slightly
true. Um, what, what I do is,

793
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:10,210
is by no means is it 24, seven,
but I'm, I'm working quite a bit.

794
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:14,050
Um, and I'm okay with that
because I've chosen this job,

795
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:16,030
what I,

796
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:20,830
I've actually turned over this idea
of work life balance for the moment.

797
00:49:20,831 --> 00:49:24,670
And I look at energy management and that's
kind of the term that I look at and I

798
00:49:24,671 --> 00:49:29,290
try to share a lot more of with um,
with our employees.

799
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,440
We have 80% millennials. So that
right there, and it's is an,

800
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:37,480
we're an agency so that is as cut
throat as it gets. I mean, you are like,

801
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:40,390
you are beholden to a client.
Uh,

802
00:49:40,391 --> 00:49:43,150
and that means you got to get that out
when you said you were going to get that

803
00:49:43,151 --> 00:49:46,450
out, you know, unless you're going to
answer the phone tomorrow with like,

804
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:49,840
you know, client breathing down
your neck. Yep. Which happens also.

805
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:54,520
But this idea of energy management is
something that makes more sense to me

806
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:58,690
today rather than a work life balance.
Unfortunately, or fortunately,

807
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:04,120
energy management is really being,
uh, aware of how you're feeling,

808
00:50:04,121 --> 00:50:07,810
where your anxiety level is, where
you're at, where your anxiety level is.

809
00:50:07,811 --> 00:50:09,790
Are you at Code Red?
Because if you're a code red,

810
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:13,480
we need to like figure out how to get
to pink or how to get to it like an an

811
00:50:13,481 --> 00:50:14,950
orange.
Um,

812
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:19,980
setting up little milestones
across your day to then celebrate.

813
00:50:20,261 --> 00:50:23,270
Take a break. So you're going to
work for 10 minutes. I'm sorry.

814
00:50:23,271 --> 00:50:26,590
You're going to work for two hours on
this one project that you're working on,

815
00:50:26,591 --> 00:50:30,170
this one spreadsheet or this one
deliverable. You're going to, you,

816
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:33,440
you're going to get to a stopping
point where you know, you can get up,

817
00:50:33,441 --> 00:50:36,800
take a breath and you can go check
Instagram for 10 minutes. You can go out,

818
00:50:36,801 --> 00:50:39,740
walk the high line, you can go for a
cup of coffee, you can go out to lunch.

819
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:43,000
Those are things I think going back
to my project management roots,

820
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:45,050
I think they're really, really
important. I think of, you know,

821
00:50:45,051 --> 00:50:50,051
if I'm looking at a Gantt chart of my day
and where my energy tips and falls and

822
00:50:50,091 --> 00:50:54,980
after lunch and whatnot, just being
super, super aware of, um, how,

823
00:50:55,250 --> 00:51:00,200
how I'm feeling inside and how an
employee employees feeling inside and how

824
00:51:00,201 --> 00:51:03,710
that's manifesting, whether or not
that's manifesting physically and I'm,

825
00:51:03,711 --> 00:51:08,040
you know, maybe someone's grinding their
teeth are getting really upset or uh,

826
00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:11,060
or how that's just manifesting
inside with, you know,

827
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:16,130
not feeling good enough about yourself
and feeling a extremely competitive with

828
00:51:16,131 --> 00:51:17,210
that other person or Gus,

829
00:51:17,211 --> 00:51:20,510
you heard that person's getting 10
k more and you do the same job like,

830
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:23,390
so managing,

831
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:27,290
managing one's energy is super
important right now. Yes,

832
00:51:27,291 --> 00:51:29,990
having work life balance is like a dream.

833
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:34,430
I think that if any of us can go back in
time and clock in and clock out as some

834
00:51:34,431 --> 00:51:39,410
of our parents did or work that eight
hour day with a half an hour lunch break

835
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:43,570
as some people do in
Europe, quite frankly. Um,

836
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:48,560
that is kind of utopic and
there are places to do that.

837
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:53,740
Um, I can't tell you that agency life is
that place right now. And maybe it maybe,

838
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:58,160
maybe as we see more a remote working,
you do that really well. I mean,

839
00:51:58,510 --> 00:52:03,260
does that extremely well. Um, but agencies
are funny because for the most part,

840
00:52:03,261 --> 00:52:07,370
you're in roles that you need to be,
you need to be present on a floor for,

841
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:10,880
you need to be able to look
across that desk and say, Hey,

842
00:52:10,881 --> 00:52:14,650
will you look at my deck for a second?
There is such a collaborative, um,

843
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:19,530
Yin and Yang there. So energy man.
Uh, so work life balance is, um,

844
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:24,660
is something that I'm aware of.
Wish I had that answer too. Uh,

845
00:52:24,830 --> 00:52:29,540
but time management is where I'm really
trying to get more people to focus on

846
00:52:29,541 --> 00:52:33,530
and be aware of just how they're feeling
in any given moment and when they can

847
00:52:33,531 --> 00:52:38,210
just take a timeout, timeouts really,
really, really help. And we all, I mean,

848
00:52:38,211 --> 00:52:42,410
we all deserve timeouts. Like,
what are we doing here? Yep.

849
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:48,010
Great. Well, thank you so
much for your time. Thanks.
