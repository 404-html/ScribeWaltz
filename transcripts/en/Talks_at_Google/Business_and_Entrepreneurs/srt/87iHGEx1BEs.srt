1
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,700
Hi Dan. Dan's doing well.
It's good to be here. I left.

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,180
Austin was 75 degrees and
now we're a little bit,

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:16,890
even less than 70 opposites. It's
good. I brought scarves, I got hats,

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,760
all the things that

5
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,380
we have supplied him
with some Google swag.

6
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,820
So we are really excited to have you
here today. Derek, have to be here.

7
00:00:26,821 --> 00:00:27,654
Thank you for having me.

8
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:33,150
So my name is Ashley [inaudible] and
today I'm just so excited to introduce all

9
00:00:33,641 --> 00:00:38,320
of you to Darren k Roberts.
Darren has an amazing story.

10
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,110
Um,
it's not conventional in any means.

11
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:46,350
Darren is a Harvard Law
School Grad turned NFL coach,

12
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:47,260
yeah.

13
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:52,260
Turned bestselling author and now he is
a lecturer at the University of Texas at

14
00:00:55,001 --> 00:00:59,590
Austin where he actually started a center
for sports leadership and innovation.

15
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,240
He's the founding director there.

16
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:05,260
Yes,
it's been fun and chase five little people

17
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,720
ages seven to seven months.
So

18
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,800
definitely. This is great. I'm glad
to be here. This is a break from home.

19
00:01:13,801 --> 00:01:16,530
It's good. Good. So I will, we'll
talk about a lot of things today.

20
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,070
We'll talk about his book call an
audible. Um, congratulations on your book.

21
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,720
Amazon. It was one of their
number one new releases.

22
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,510
Sports illustrated said this is one of
the best sports business books of 2017.

23
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,220
Yeah, no big deal. Right? Yeah,

24
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,550
it's been fun. It was one of
those things, I don't know if,

25
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:38,551
if people are like me where you
have this Google doc and um,

26
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:43,190
it's, it's been living for
five to six years with ideas.

27
00:01:43,191 --> 00:01:45,290
And that was where I was with this book.

28
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:50,270
I had been working on an introduction
for four years and I finally just woke up

29
00:01:50,271 --> 00:01:54,260
one morning and told my wife, okay,
six days a week, two hours a day,

30
00:01:54,261 --> 00:01:57,020
I'm going to write from
three 30 to five 30.

31
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,770
I'm gonna go to the same coffee shop,
turn off the Wifi and just go.

32
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,510
And she's like Godspeed.
And we did it. And yeah,

33
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:07,800
it would be really to hear it
is, it's like, it's actually
tangible. It's amazing.

34
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:10,430
And I have one too. It's
my own special copy. Oh,

35
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,990
did you read it before you go
to bed at night? They do. Well,

36
00:02:12,991 --> 00:02:14,780
I've already read it and you know,
I'll read it again,

37
00:02:14,781 --> 00:02:17,450
maybe after the stock and you can
buy more copies if you need to. Okay.

38
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,340
So I can't, I can't, you
know, go through you.

39
00:02:19,341 --> 00:02:23,060
I got to go through and be better to
go through me. Yeah. Better take what?

40
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,510
I've got. Five college tuition, so
Gotcha. We have to support the hammer.

41
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,780
I understand. Um, so daring,
I mean you've done a lot,

42
00:02:29,781 --> 00:02:32,750
but I also want to
mention in his free time,

43
00:02:32,751 --> 00:02:37,751
Darrin also started in leads a
nonprofit football camp four.

44
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:38,670
Is it high school?

45
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,800
Cool. How's high school?
High school students?

46
00:02:40,801 --> 00:02:45,510
So these are not blue chip athletes,
right? These are high school.

47
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,470
Try hard. I love Football
Darin types. Right? Um,

48
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,460
and we take them for a week,

49
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:58,670
40 high school students and in the
morning it's a yoga and meditation and,

50
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,530
and Ben, we play football for
about two and a half hours.

51
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,200
Then it's three hours of act prep.

52
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:10,620
And we built a curriculum where we
have taken the act math section and

53
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:15,640
translated it into football examples.
So geometry,

54
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:20,040
we teach geometry and Algebra or
using a football field as a grid. Um,

55
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:25,060
and then at night we have a series of
two workshops. So social media etiquette,

56
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:28,120
dress etiquette,
how to write thank you notes.

57
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,580
And it's been a wonderful program.

58
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:34,720
We've had 500 kids come
through in the last nine years.

59
00:03:34,721 --> 00:03:36,180
So yeah,

60
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,470
it's really nice to know that you know,

61
00:03:38,471 --> 00:03:42,430
you are giving back to commit to the
community and teaching practical skills,

62
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:46,410
right? Yes. The academic piece. But
also what, what should you wear,

63
00:03:46,411 --> 00:03:49,920
how can you present yourself in a way
that is the best reflection of, of you

64
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,530
and one like the social media class.
Oh Geez.

65
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,770
So I will go through all of their,

66
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:59,850
so part of the application process is
they have to list their social media

67
00:03:59,851 --> 00:04:00,684
handles.

68
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:06,170
And then we have a team of people who
we scrub all of their handles platforms

69
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,100
and take screenshots of the good,
the bad and the ugly. Oh Wow.

70
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,600
And they don't know what's coming.

71
00:04:12,601 --> 00:04:16,770
And so on day four I of just walk up
and I'll have this dummy slide up about,

72
00:04:16,771 --> 00:04:20,190
hey, how to make a speech.
And then slide two,

73
00:04:20,191 --> 00:04:25,191
we'll be someone's post where it's
nothing but profanity and you know,

74
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,390
drinking a beer like, hey, who is this?
And everyone's embarrassed. Oh my gosh,

75
00:04:30,391 --> 00:04:32,630
I can't believe you would do that.
So now hold on,

76
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:37,560
there are 2 billion people out
there on some form of social media,

77
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,710
why would you be embarrassed? Right. Um,

78
00:04:40,711 --> 00:04:44,460
and so we start there and then kind of
work through how they can present a good

79
00:04:44,461 --> 00:04:45,250
image online.

80
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,750
That's great. I think with, with
technology and with all social media,

81
00:04:48,751 --> 00:04:51,960
it's so easy to just write
something or post something.

82
00:04:51,961 --> 00:04:55,770
But if you were to actually sit like
in a stage and have the whole world,

83
00:04:55,771 --> 00:04:59,700
I'm maybe you would say that maybe
your students or other folks wouldn't

84
00:04:59,701 --> 00:05:00,360
actually.

85
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,260
Yeah.
And you know,

86
00:05:01,261 --> 00:05:05,770
all the research right now is showing
that so much of what we do online is,

87
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:09,780
is subconscious.
So they're showing people tweets,

88
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:14,250
posts that they've liked or shared and
asking them if they recognize them.

89
00:05:14,251 --> 00:05:19,230
And the rate's around 25% so
you're just scrolling, scrolling,

90
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,960
scrolling, scrolling, scrolling
like here, hard here or there.

91
00:05:21,961 --> 00:05:25,620
And it becomes sort of stream of
consciousness. And so really for us,

92
00:05:25,621 --> 00:05:30,480
we're trying to get the students to be
more intentional and deliberate about

93
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:33,360
their move. Right? So when
you hit the heart button,

94
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,800
we say for employers or other schools,
that is an endorsement.

95
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:41,910
So you need to think about, do I want
to co-sign on this message? Yeah.

96
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,970
And this is all in his free time,
right?

97
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,710
So in addition into the fourth
and one football camp, um,

98
00:05:48,711 --> 00:05:53,711
Dan also leads a industry leading
podcasts and he's also the chief of the

99
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,360
Doughnut Council, which is calling
me my favorite part of this talk.

100
00:05:56,361 --> 00:05:58,010
And we'll tell a little bit more about

101
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:58,990
that later.
Um,

102
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,750
and like I mentioned in some of the
comms that you might have seen before,

103
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,210
we will,
I've promised them if it's okay with you,

104
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,660
we will talk about Kevin Durant
and we will talk about doughnuts.

105
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:13,460
I love doughnuts. I can do that. Good. All
right. Done. Is that all right with y'all?

106
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,330
Okay, sounds good. So why don't
we start at the beginning. Okay.

107
00:06:17,331 --> 00:06:21,740
You're a Texas born and raised.
And what did you, you know,

108
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:26,630
when you were a teenager kid, what
were your dreams? So fifth generation,

109
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,000
East Texan,
what stood out?

110
00:06:29,001 --> 00:06:34,001
My Dad showed me this map of this Panola
county where he's from and it was a

111
00:06:34,431 --> 00:06:39,431
census track from 1870 and there's a
plot of land that has 153 acres and the

112
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:46,010
name Bill Roberts and it's 1870 right?
So he points to the map,

113
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:50,750
he points to me and he says, this is
why you will never have any excuses.

114
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,540
I'm like, what the hell is he
talking about? Like I don't know.

115
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:58,790
And then I find out that my great great
grandfather finds a way to get 153 acres

116
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:05,870
in a county that sent troops to the
confederacy, right? Like how does,

117
00:07:05,871 --> 00:07:08,810
how does it has a black man in
1870 like how do you do that?

118
00:07:08,811 --> 00:07:11,510
And so my last book will be this,

119
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,530
I want to present three different
scenarios in a fictional way of like what

120
00:07:15,531 --> 00:07:19,340
could have happened.
But that sort of set the stage for me of,

121
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,150
okay,
I got to pull the top off of my goals.

122
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:27,080
And so I want it to be the
governor of Texas by 40. Um,

123
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:31,880
I turned 40 in November,
so it took a wrong turn somewhere,

124
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,910
kind of push it out.
So everything was was um,

125
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,760
I want it to be the governor.

126
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:42,080
And so I thought that was
undergrad government, pre law,

127
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:47,330
law school practice somewhere run for
Congress, like very linear, you know,

128
00:07:47,331 --> 00:07:51,850
if Aiden be, if he didn't see and uh,
now my life is just like, you know,

129
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,700
a sketchpad. Well, I love it. I think it's
just a different direction. But, okay,

130
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:59,900
so let's, let's talk about
law. So you want it to go to
law school. Why Law School?

131
00:07:59,901 --> 00:08:03,200
Was it because you want it
to be governor and then was,

132
00:08:03,201 --> 00:08:05,030
I know you kind of talked about Harvard,

133
00:08:05,031 --> 00:08:08,420
there was something about that school
that really drew you there. Yeah,

134
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:11,760
Gregory Peck had a lot to
do with it. Right? So I,

135
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:17,630
if I think about the imagery that really
made me think about law school to kill

136
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:21,230
a mockingbird comes to
mind and seeing where this,

137
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:26,210
this powerful figure being able to
influence the community around him.

138
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:31,270
That was one image that stood out for me.
And then my dad bought a book of a,

139
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,090
it was a biography of Thurgood Marshall.

140
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:40,460
And just remember this image of him
standing on the steps of the Supreme Court

141
00:08:40,461 --> 00:08:44,420
after Brown v Board in
thinking to myself like,

142
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,700
I want to be like that guy.
Um,

143
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:50,300
and so everything was
channeled towards law school.

144
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:54,410
And I'm at the University of Texas,
I'm student body president.

145
00:08:54,411 --> 00:08:57,930
I had great grades. I'm like, I'm just
going to walk in to be easy, right? Easy,

146
00:08:57,931 --> 00:09:01,140
right? They're going to like,
oh, we've been waiting for
you for the last 18 years.

147
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:06,460
Welcome, welcome, welcome. Finally.
Right? And get the letter back.

148
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:11,200
And it's the old wait list.
Right? So it's we like you,

149
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:15,360
we like some more people, a lot
more than you, and you're like,

150
00:09:15,361 --> 00:09:19,710
how is this is like, you know, in the
event that all of them tell us no,

151
00:09:19,711 --> 00:09:24,640
we may call you back, but if you have
better options, don't wait for us.

152
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:28,720
That's worse than a no. Yes it is. It is.

153
00:09:28,721 --> 00:09:31,540
Because it's like your
clothes. I would, it's funny,

154
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:36,340
at the time I thought I wanted to know,
but in retrospect,

155
00:09:36,341 --> 00:09:39,250
I think the list was probably better
because then there's like this little

156
00:09:39,251 --> 00:09:43,270
glimmer of hope I could somehow
alter the situation some way.

157
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,270
Um,
but I wait list at four years in a row.

158
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:51,830
So Gwen Roberts and my mom's like, just
do something with your life. Right. Uh,

159
00:09:51,831 --> 00:09:52,601
I worked on the hill,

160
00:09:52,601 --> 00:09:55,750
I went to the Kennedy school and
then the fourth year I got in.

161
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,140
And was it everything
you imagined in more?

162
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,910
It was worse. It was worse. It was a hell

163
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,470
no. I, it was good,

164
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:11,250
but I like this. I was about to lie. I
was, I do like blatantly lied to myself.

165
00:10:11,251 --> 00:10:15,180
I'm like, no, it was bad. Um,
it's an interesting place, right?

166
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:19,620
So you have 550 students come into a
class and everyone's so high strung.

167
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:22,950
You've got the folks who are
just fresh out of Undergrad.

168
00:10:22,951 --> 00:10:27,330
So very going Berserk every
single second of the day.

169
00:10:27,331 --> 00:10:31,890
The gunners on the front row hide worked
for a while. So I was kinda chill.

170
00:10:31,891 --> 00:10:36,150
I had to make sure I got the Dunkin
donuts for going into class priorities,

171
00:10:36,151 --> 00:10:38,220
priorities. But it was fun. I think I,

172
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:43,221
I really enjoy being challenged and I did
like the grind of like the one l first

173
00:10:44,581 --> 00:10:49,320
year, you know, in the library. He kind of
steak a little bit. You're reading stuff,

174
00:10:49,321 --> 00:10:52,800
you're falling asleep. I
liked that piece of it. Um,

175
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:53,910
but I knew there was something,

176
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,190
something else I should
probably be doing my life.

177
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:01,470
And so this talk is all about risks
and your story in itself is really

178
00:11:01,841 --> 00:11:04,750
interesting, right? To pivot
so many different times.

179
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:09,070
And I'd like to know it was
your summer internship, right?

180
00:11:09,071 --> 00:11:11,590
Your first summer
internship in law school.

181
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,530
Tell us about that
experience and how you felt.

182
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,470
So I worked at,
uh,

183
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,223
you know,

184
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:22,870
name, ampersand, name,
name, name, okay. In DC.

185
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,820
And
I remember the first day walking in,

186
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:34,380
working my way to my office
and recognizing the fact
that no one had smiled,

187
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,190
right. Receptionist, you
know, inserts first year,

188
00:11:39,191 --> 00:11:42,760
associate insert, you know, throw
your partner. I thought, well, okay,

189
00:11:42,761 --> 00:11:46,600
maybe it's just a rough time,
you know, that was the summer

190
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:53,050
and the highlight was the
highlight first day, this summer,

191
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,570
this first year associate comes in,
hey man, what are you doing for lunch?

192
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,830
I'm like, I don't have any plans. You're
going with me, right? This guy's not, hey,

193
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:03,760
welcoming. We'd go to lunch.
He's not talking to me. He's
like, on his blackberry,

194
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:08,800
it's 2006 was on a blackberry,
you know, and, and I'm like,
hey man, how's it going?

195
00:12:08,801 --> 00:12:09,520
We're talking.
He's like,

196
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,540
I just love it when you summers get
here because we get our lunches, cops.

197
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,630
Oh my gosh. So you heated
it's recruiting, right?

198
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,730
He wanted you there,

199
00:12:18,731 --> 00:12:21,790
not necessarily to talk to
you but to eat the lunch.

200
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,450
Yes. So then I thought, wow,

201
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:29,010
the highlight of this
grown man's life is a cot,

202
00:12:29,011 --> 00:12:34,010
summer intern lunch,
like you're like visit.

203
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,940
So I remember going back
to law school thinking,

204
00:12:38,941 --> 00:12:41,520
okay then there's probably something else.

205
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:46,110
And that's when my buddy the next year
calls me to go to work a football camp.

206
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,370
And we were both try
hard players with like,

207
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,700
there were no teams beating down
our door in high school saying come,

208
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:57,330
come play for us. And, but
he was a football coach,

209
00:12:57,331 --> 00:13:00,600
a high school coach and he said, hey,
come to the South Carolina football camp.

210
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:06,300
So I get there and they need someone to
fill in for a coach who hadn't shown up

211
00:13:06,301 --> 00:13:09,870
something they can play Texas
football and I wonder what's going on.

212
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:13,110
So I'll raise my hand. I'm
like, hell, where do you coach?

213
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,600
Like mount pleasant high
school. It's like, all right,
mount pleasant high school.

214
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,220
You have group six? Yes sir. I'm like,
what the hell is he talking about?

215
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,270
Groups six was 66th graders. Oh, okay.

216
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:29,730
None of whom had any athletic
talent whatsoever. Mom was,

217
00:13:29,731 --> 00:13:33,240
had taken them to academy to get like
swooshes and they were protecting the

218
00:13:33,241 --> 00:13:37,180
house and they were doing it and could
not back peddle like the length of this

219
00:13:37,181 --> 00:13:38,900
stage.
Um,

220
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,670
and they had a coach who couldn't
coach best 72 hours of my life.

221
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,710
And I just,

222
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:52,410
there are these very brief moments in
football where socioeconomic status goes

223
00:13:52,411 --> 00:13:55,890
out, the window was out of
town. You live religion,

224
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:59,160
like you're just trying to get
11 people on the same page.

225
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:04,530
And I recognize for me that became
a new form of public service.

226
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,570
So I started though the journey
to try to become a coach.

227
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,470
So I think many of us,
I'm sure you might agree,

228
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:18,240
oftentimes we have inklings to do things,
we see certain passions,

229
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:23,930
but what was it that got you from feeling
that you love this thing and shoving

230
00:14:23,941 --> 00:14:25,020
it away as like,
okay,

231
00:14:25,021 --> 00:14:30,021
that was a great 72 hour vacation and
then turning it into something tangible

232
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:33,590
and deciding you wanted to coach coach

233
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:38,210
football. So Renee Brown says,

234
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:43,270
she says emotions are data and I could
not get away from the feeling in my gut.

235
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:50,060
Like, even when I left the camp, I go
back to Cambridge. It was in my mind,

236
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,250
it was this an easy in my stomach.

237
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:56,930
And I've also just been up the belief,
my dad's a Baptist minister.

238
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:02,380
So if you walk into the Mount Olive
Baptist Church on a Sunday at 12,

239
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:06,770
24:00 PM, Kurt Roberts is
going to be standing up saying,

240
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:11,210
you don't know when you're going to die.
You better get right with Jesus. Right?

241
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,120
And I think hearing that for so long,

242
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:19,070
this just the delicate
nature of mortality,

243
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,120
like you don't know, we assume
so much. I've always thought,

244
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:27,140
let me try to pull these things and
I'm thinking about putting off into the

245
00:15:27,141 --> 00:15:29,360
distance.
I can let me make them,

246
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,320
let me pull them into the present
tense because I don't know if I get to

247
00:15:33,321 --> 00:15:36,410
retirement. Right? And people
are like, oh, just go practice.

248
00:15:36,411 --> 00:15:40,070
And then you can do that as sort
of as a retirement job. I'm like,

249
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:45,170
who says I get to retirement?
Right? So, um, from that step

250
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,020
I went into excel, which if this
was 2018, I would've gotten a sheet.

251
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,170
Um,

252
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:58,820
and I went through every team in the
NFL and I found their address and every

253
00:15:58,821 --> 00:16:03,821
coach on staff and I went through every
bio and tried to find some connection.

254
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:08,600
Are you from Texas and you're getting
a letter from me. Um, you know,

255
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:10,130
did you studied government Undergrad?

256
00:16:10,131 --> 00:16:12,440
You're getting a letter for
me and I just wrote a letter,

257
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,690
multiple letters to every team in the NFL.

258
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,050
So that's part of this.

259
00:16:16,051 --> 00:16:19,830
This is one of my favorite parts of this
book and I'm going to read a piece of

260
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:24,660
one of the letters. Dear coach and
you sounded exactly like this, right?

261
00:16:24,661 --> 00:16:26,280
Yes, exactly. Your coach.

262
00:16:26,281 --> 00:16:31,281
I am a third year student at Harvard law
school and I want to become a football

263
00:16:32,011 --> 00:16:36,270
coach. After just three days of
working as a volunteer coach,

264
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:40,350
I realized that changing the
life trajectories of young
men can be fulfilled by

265
00:16:40,351 --> 00:16:43,590
coaching a sport that I fell
in love first in high school.

266
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:47,820
I understand that you receive
countless letters each year,

267
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:53,130
but I promise I will work harder than
anybody else you are considering for this

268
00:16:53,131 --> 00:16:55,990
position. And then you like went
down and you said, you know,

269
00:16:56,010 --> 00:17:00,450
some other wonderful things and then
ended with please just consider me for any

270
00:17:00,451 --> 00:17:03,330
entry level position you
may have available. Yes.

271
00:17:03,331 --> 00:17:06,360
So what you sent this out to many,
many more.

272
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,700
Yes. In My, you know,

273
00:17:08,701 --> 00:17:13,701
my last name wasn't Bella check and I
didn't have any buddies like I had no,

274
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:15,720
there was no end.

275
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:21,290
So for me I knew the only way that I
could break in would be to start at not

276
00:17:24,631 --> 00:17:29,460
even the bottom, like below the
totem pole. And so what happened,

277
00:17:29,461 --> 00:17:33,800
you sent this, I said this and I
got 31 rejection. So you know Bella,

278
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:37,200
check Tomlin, you name it,
going down the list, John Fox,

279
00:17:37,201 --> 00:17:41,640
all of these teams are saying no. And
it gets to a point where, this is April,

280
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:47,150
this is two months before I'm graduating
and my classmates are going to the

281
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:53,100
Supreme Court and the White House and
insert banking and I bake here and I'm

282
00:17:53,101 --> 00:17:54,780
just waiting on one.
Yes.

283
00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:00,360
And I finally get a call one day from a
guy named herm Edwards who was at Kansas

284
00:18:00,361 --> 00:18:03,690
City chiefs head coach. And he's
like, Hey, this is her Matt woods.

285
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:08,790
I need to talk to their Roberts. So
I think it's a prank. And I'm uh,

286
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:12,600
I'm about to say something that was,
wasn't not going to get this job.

287
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,760
I'm like, yes, sir. He said,
hey, I don't open my mail.

288
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,690
My secretary put this letter on my
desk. What's wrong with you? Right?

289
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:27,240
So I said, well, you know,
nothing that's been documented.

290
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:30,180
Uh, I worked this Cam, I'm telling me,
they were like, yeah, whatever. Okay,

291
00:18:30,181 --> 00:18:31,980
here's the deal. He's like,
take out a pen and paper,

292
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:36,250
take off the training camp internally.
Yes,

293
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:41,220
no pay, right? It gets
better, no benefits.

294
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:44,340
And then he says 18 hour days.

295
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,480
So I'm going back to employment law.
I'm like,

296
00:18:48,481 --> 00:18:53,460
this has gotta be some kind
of like 18 hours. He goes,

297
00:18:53,461 --> 00:18:58,410
are you in?
And this three seconds sort of window.

298
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,680
And I knew I couldn't ask for
any clarifying information.
I said, yes, he's okay.

299
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:08,070
Graduate from law school. Get
here, hang the phone up. Right?

300
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:12,930
So I drove June the sixth from Cambridge,

301
00:19:12,931 --> 00:19:14,730
Massachusetts to Kansas City,

302
00:19:14,731 --> 00:19:19,731
Missouri and a 2002 Chevy Tahoe
that I still own because I'm cheap.

303
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,520
It's also why I'm a planet
fitness member. Yes. Um,

304
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:33,060
yes, yes. Um, and I was the grunt.

305
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:37,320
I was, I didn't sign a piece of
paper in six months like I was,

306
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:41,370
if you were to Google Darrin
Robert's Kansas city chiefs in 2007,

307
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,540
nothing would come up. I was, hey Darren,

308
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,040
offensive lineman would say, hey, we
need 40 barbecue sandwiches. Yes sir.

309
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:54,120
I'd go downtown, get the salmon. Just
bring it back. The defensive Lineman, hey,

310
00:19:54,121 --> 00:19:58,950
we need two cases of dip
skull. Um, I go fine.

311
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,880
I go to seven. 11 is trying to like
as much dip as I could take it back.

312
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,750
I slept at Arrowhead for six months.

313
00:20:06,751 --> 00:20:11,751
I got a twin blowup mattress and I
just wanted to be the first person,

314
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:16,830
the first face that herm Edwards saw
when he walked into the office four 30

315
00:20:16,831 --> 00:20:19,530
every morning.
I was right there and I was the last face.

316
00:20:19,531 --> 00:20:22,330
He saw him when he left at 11:00 PM.
And how,

317
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,310
how did you decide to give up law school?

318
00:20:26,311 --> 00:20:31,080
And I'm sure you know that
life yeah. For, for this, yeah.

319
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:36,290
I had a professor, David Wilkins who
was a really great mentor of mine.

320
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,390
I'm talking with him about
the decision. He says, listen,

321
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:45,270
when you get your diploma, what you
won't find on it is an expiration date.

322
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,660
He said, I'm just going to take
a wild gamble here and say that

323
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:51,310
yeah,

324
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:55,060
when you leave the NFL there will
still be the legal problems going on.

325
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:59,620
So if you want to practice you
can, he said, let me ask you this.

326
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,020
How aware is this opportunity for you?

327
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:05,650
So like how many times will
NFL teams allow you to become

328
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,360
okay,

329
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,570
uh, coaching intern or train
to get better. And so for me,

330
00:21:10,571 --> 00:21:15,220
I just thought that with every opportunity
that I get, I think to myself, okay,

331
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:18,670
one does it kind of flow in with my
purpose? And that was an easy check. Yep.

332
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:23,050
And then how rare is it? Like will this
come around or something like it soon?

333
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,810
And if the answer is no to that,
I'm taking it now.

334
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:30,820
And then just just adjust from there.
So tell us more about that first year.

335
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:34,450
Yeah, it good, bad. Yeah. Coaches
wouldn't talk to me for two weeks.

336
00:21:34,451 --> 00:21:39,250
So I had all these coaches on staff who
were former NFL players and you know,

337
00:21:39,251 --> 00:21:44,251
they paid their dues and they've got
this dude who hasn't coached or played in

338
00:21:45,251 --> 00:21:49,990
college just around in the corner
in a Hoodie. And they're like,

339
00:21:49,991 --> 00:21:51,940
what the hell? Who is this guy?
Like why did you bring them on?

340
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,510
But they sort of warmed up a little bit.
First game we play at Houston,

341
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:57,940
a part of my job is to make copies.

342
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:02,590
So I make up a copy of the plane
manifest for the flight and I see,

343
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,480
and Robert's seat 40 d oh there you go.

344
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:12,970
This is on a Thursday,
Friday chief of staff.

345
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,930
Hey, get all the manifest, throw away,

346
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,530
here's the actual manifest.
We had to make some changes.

347
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:24,260
40 d no,
Darin Roberts.

348
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,750
So someone in the organization
that you yanked my name,

349
00:22:28,751 --> 00:22:30,880
they thought that I had
not paid my dues yet.

350
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:35,200
Pretty high up person in the
organization. Um, so I said screw it.

351
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:38,530
I bought a southwest flight from
Kansas City, Missouri, the hobby.

352
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:43,780
I land in Houston. I know where the hotel,
the team hotel is at Saturday night.

353
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:48,410
I'm the first person they seem to get
off her walks and he's like, dude,

354
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:53,290
this guy here's like, what are you
doing? He's like, were you on the fly?

355
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:56,050
I was like, no. I took a flight. Hey
listen, I don't want to be in the way.

356
00:22:56,051 --> 00:22:59,320
I'm just going to sit in the back of
the room if you needed me. He's like,

357
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:02,920
we probably won't need you Darin,
but just stay out of the way.

358
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:07,960
They cool special teams coach.
He's like, Hey, what are you doing?

359
00:23:07,961 --> 00:23:09,130
I was like, Hey, I took a flight.

360
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:13,750
I could use you tomorrow
because he had a lot.

361
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:17,830
We had a lot of new players and I need
to be able to find them when we go punt

362
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:22,120
or kickoff, so could you help me
wrangle players? I'm like, I could,

363
00:23:22,121 --> 00:23:26,980
but don't have any credentials.
Can you kind of, yeah. He's like,

364
00:23:26,981 --> 00:23:30,850
let me do something by midnight.
I had credentials by kickoff.

365
00:23:30,851 --> 00:23:32,830
I'm on the sideline and I'm in.

366
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,290
And so I was on the flight
from that point forward.

367
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:39,160
But I think the point is like you really
have to barge your way in and like a

368
00:23:39,161 --> 00:23:43,270
diplomatic way, right?
In a non creepy way.

369
00:23:43,271 --> 00:23:48,080
Which in retrospect that probably was
creepy. So you had to be somewhat creepy,

370
00:23:48,081 --> 00:23:49,640
but kind of find this balance.
I don't know.

371
00:23:49,641 --> 00:23:52,910
I don't have like a nice
creepy factor, right? Yeah.

372
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:56,960
But I think it's so easy for us to send
emails and think that we've done the due

373
00:23:56,961 --> 00:23:57,794
diligence.

374
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:02,850
Like the email is enough and you need
physical presence to separate yourself

375
00:24:04,821 --> 00:24:09,140
from all the other folks who are
trying to get into this position.

376
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,440
Um,
and as you know,

377
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,190
today we want to talk about risk
taking and certainly your story.

378
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:21,490
Do you have tips for actionable things
that folks listening and Googlers here

379
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:27,720
you can take back to say, I have this
inkling I really liked to do this. Yes.

380
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:32,450
How can I get from there to
something that could be my lifestyle?

381
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,080
Yeah. So there's some really good research
that's shown that the Ikea effect.

382
00:24:37,081 --> 00:24:40,590
So who shot that? Ikea, okay.
We've all done it, right?

383
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:43,050
You walk in and you sweat,
you smell those, you know,

384
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:47,160
kind of weird meatballs and you're
walking around and it's kind of odd.

385
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,100
It's weird. Anyway, they're
like halfway cooked and

386
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:55,380
so everything looks so
pristine and you're like, oh,

387
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,610
everything could go into my apartment.
Like I'll pick that desk.

388
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:05,320
You get the box and then you go home.
You realize you don't have any tools. Um,

389
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,460
you never assembled anything
since like third grade.

390
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:12,630
Now building the Mongolian the
volcano, if it doesn't go off, um,

391
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:17,140
and you build this thing and it's a
little wobbly and one of the drawers and

392
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:20,850
really pull out, right? But
it's yours and you built it.

393
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:26,970
We're finding that this ikea effect
and think about it as a sunk cost.

394
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:31,860
People think about the fact that they
dumped so much time and effort into one

395
00:25:31,861 --> 00:25:32,880
course of action.

396
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:38,990
They use that experience and
that ownership to Ben talk
themselves out of taking

397
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:40,260
the risk.
Right?

398
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:45,180
Because I've worked at Google for eight
years and I started here and now I'm

399
00:25:45,181 --> 00:25:49,950
there. I'm not going to take a
chance and now become a chef, right?

400
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:56,030
What we found is the way to get past
that is to expose yourself to rejection.

401
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:00,503
Okay?

402
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:05,250
So I'm going to challenge you to put
yourself in positions where people are

403
00:26:05,251 --> 00:26:09,340
telling, you know, okay, here's
another technique or rejection resume.

404
00:26:09,341 --> 00:26:11,370
She write this down, write this
down or tweeted, sing yourself or,

405
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:16,860
or t mail it to yourself or something.
We have many, many, many forms.

406
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,350
Um,
take your resume

407
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:26,310
and under education list all of the
schools that you didn't get into. Okay.

408
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:30,600
Work Experience. Every
job you did not get, okay,

409
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,700
go all the way down for
awards and distinctions,

410
00:26:32,701 --> 00:26:34,430
all the awards and honors
that you didn't get.

411
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:39,390
Take it and then send it to
all of your friends. All right?

412
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:44,660
So I do some trainings with corporations
and I'll have the CEO or CFO do this

413
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,730
and then ask her to send it out. Right?
And first they don't want to do it. Yeah.

414
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,773
Okay.

415
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:55,830
And then they do it and they send it out
and it helps to humanize them and the

416
00:26:55,831 --> 00:26:58,980
organization. So someone was like,
oh, I didn't get into Berkeley.

417
00:26:58,981 --> 00:27:03,540
Either it's great. Or Oh, I
got turned down for the 30
for 30, you know, too. Right.

418
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:07,170
So I think building this comfort
level with rejection and was,

419
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:12,450
and getting the no helps because you will
document all of your big no's in life

420
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,420
and then realize I'm still
alive. Yeah. Like I'm, I'm okay.

421
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:21,780
And if I get a subsequent
know from taking a risk,

422
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,470
I'm going to survive because look at
all the things that I've been able to

423
00:27:25,471 --> 00:27:26,304
withstand.

424
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:31,140
So really going through and catalog
and being very intentional about,

425
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:31,621
hey,

426
00:27:31,621 --> 00:27:34,650
where at the time that I've gotten turned
down or didn't get the big thing that

427
00:27:34,651 --> 00:27:39,600
I wanted and comparing that to,
I'm still in a good position.

428
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:44,120
Let me take that as confidence to go
ahead and take more risks. Okay. Um,

429
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:47,340
so in my class, my students,
they go on rejection challenges.

430
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:52,320
So to partners, so partners, you have to
go to Starbucks and ask for a free drink,

431
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,920
your partner videotapes you.
Okay.

432
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:58,650
And I had them do a pre
write up in a post right up.

433
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,980
And then we also take some
risks seeking scores. Right?

434
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:06,780
And they are so afraid. I mean, even
the partner, like we've got the footage,

435
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:11,700
can I am a Frazier? The partner
who's not even getting rejected,

436
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,350
it's like shaking back there.
Um,

437
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,430
we take all the footage and then we splice
it together and I show it to everyone

438
00:28:17,431 --> 00:28:22,050
in the class. And that's usually a
pretty interesting day. But they go in,

439
00:28:22,051 --> 00:28:24,270
they get the no on a Macchiato,
right?

440
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:28,920
You could hear them trembling in their
voice turn lane and then you have these

441
00:28:28,921 --> 00:28:33,780
great papers being written when
they say it wasn't so bad, right?

442
00:28:33,781 --> 00:28:36,660
Like
beforehand,

443
00:28:36,661 --> 00:28:40,200
I thought this was going to be the worst
experience on the face of the planet.

444
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,080
I got the, no, it wasn't so bad.

445
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,960
I think I'm even willing to take
a bigger risk in the future.

446
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:50,730
So we're really doing a lot of research
around can we help to build your

447
00:28:50,731 --> 00:28:55,731
rejection immunity by exposing
you write to new strains of,

448
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:58,380
of rejection. So, right. Yeah.

449
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:02,650
And so we, I mean, we're talking about
you as a lecture and as a teacher now,

450
00:29:02,651 --> 00:29:06,430
right? Yeah. How did you, I mean
you were NFL coach, student view,

451
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:09,840
moved onto many different teams
and then you pivoted again, right?

452
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,170
You went from coaching in the NFL,
which was another one of your dreams.

453
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:18,790
Amazing work. And then how did
you decide, okay, time to pivot.

454
00:29:18,791 --> 00:29:20,640
Let me take another risk.
Let me teach.

455
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:25,560
Yeah. So that's, that's all Dylan
Roberts. So I was in Cleveland.

456
00:29:25,561 --> 00:29:28,560
Is anyone here from Cleveland
before I start making disparaging?

457
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:33,000
It's like it goes out to the world. We
have a card. Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

458
00:29:33,001 --> 00:29:34,810
So this is a place called Cleveland.
Uh,

459
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,070
so we get to Cleveland in
2013 we went four and 12,

460
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:45,310
which as you'll know,
is not uncommon for the Cleveland browns.

461
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:50,860
And it was actually pretty damn good year.
Unfortunately,

462
00:29:50,861 --> 00:29:55,570
the owner didn't agree with that
assessment. And we play at Pittsburgh,

463
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,180
we fly it back into Cleveland.

464
00:29:58,181 --> 00:30:03,181
The last game of the season I get a text
from the owners assistant and it says,

465
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,290
aiding him staff meeting.

466
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,470
So we wake up and go into the office
and the owner walks in and he says, Hey,

467
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:15,350
really appreciate all
of your contributions.

468
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:19,660
You're all fired. All right, good luck.

469
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,360
It's like go home and I'm scrambling eggs.

470
00:30:23,361 --> 00:30:26,840
And my son walks in and
he's tugging on my shirt.

471
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:30,320
I'm scrambling eggs thinking about like,
where is the next NFL city?

472
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:35,960
And he's tugging on my shirt. I'm
like, what's up man? You eat breakfast?

473
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:42,590
I'm like, yes. Scramble, scramble,
scramble, Tuck, Tuck. I'm like,

474
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:47,060
what dude? You mean eat breakfast?
Right? So I turned to my wife,

475
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,153
I said,
Hillary,

476
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,330
we are paying a lot of money for
this kid to go to a private school

477
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:59,830
and is it too late to get a refund or
cause I don't see that something's not

478
00:30:59,871 --> 00:31:01,010
working.
Um,

479
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:07,940
my wife raised on a ranch in Kansas. She
said, well, let me ask you a question.

480
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:12,650
When was the last time you had
breakfast with Dylan? Right? Oh,

481
00:31:12,651 --> 00:31:16,520
he's never seen you eat. Do you never see
me eat? And I'm like, Oh yeah, it was,

482
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,740
I could not pinpoint the time. Right. So

483
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,260
I have a breakdown.
Eggs are burning.

484
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:31,280
You've got alarms going off like man.
And just the irony for me was that

485
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:38,410
I had spent all of my time with other
people's sons and my own son didn't know

486
00:31:38,691 --> 00:31:43,130
me, like did not. He was, he was

487
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:49,990
legitimately surprised to see me with
scrambled eggs and that was a problem.

488
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:54,920
So I decided to take a sabbatical.
Side note,

489
00:31:55,220 --> 00:32:00,220
if you ever take a sabbatical be equation
is take the time you think and it's

490
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:04,100
five x. Okay. You're like, oh I
is going to be gone for a year.

491
00:32:04,101 --> 00:32:07,490
And then I'll come back four years later,
I'm still on Sabbatical from coaching.

492
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:12,680
But it's been great. I went back to teach,
to teach at ut, some leadership classes,

493
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:18,140
the ray rice episode on the foals and I
take this proposal to our president for

494
00:32:18,141 --> 00:32:21,940
us to create a center for sports
leadership and innovation, um,

495
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:26,360
to be more intentional around how
we teach athletes to become leaders,

496
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,790
to manage their finances.

497
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:33,830
And that was in 2014 and I present
the proposal and he's like, okay,

498
00:32:33,831 --> 00:32:34,664
you're going to run it.

499
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:38,430
I said,
I'm on some sabbatical.

500
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:42,230
So kinda like here, but not,
he's like, no, you're running it.

501
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,430
And December,
2014 we launched.

502
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:50,720
So we've been at it for four years. It's
been, it's been very, very exciting.

503
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:55,750
I teach a class freshmen athletes at ut
and we started with Bernay Brown's work

504
00:32:56,361 --> 00:32:58,400
around vulnerability and empathy,

505
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:04,120
migrate over into Angela Duckworth
and grit and Carol Dweck and mindset,

506
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:09,830
um, have our failure management sequence
where they go and do all these rejection

507
00:33:09,831 --> 00:33:13,190
challenges and then end with a
leadership and financial management.

508
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,830
And how many students have
gone through this program?

509
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:19,940
So I've had 850 students I teach.

510
00:33:19,941 --> 00:33:22,730
The great thing about the class,
I think Ashley,

511
00:33:22,731 --> 00:33:27,731
is that we have half of the class
is comprised of student athletes,

512
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:32,450
half or nonathletes. Okay. So you
have these two worlds colliding,

513
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,830
you've got the receiver on the football
team sitting down with this computer,

514
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:41,750
you know, cs major. And one of the first
things I do on the first day of class,

515
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:46,670
I'll have the computer science major
come up and put her schedule down on the

516
00:33:46,671 --> 00:33:50,240
board and I'll have the football
player come up and do the same.

517
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:55,850
And you'll see football player
5:00 AM workout, breakfast, shower,

518
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:59,390
you know, classes, lunch, practice tape,

519
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:03,230
get to bed at 10 11 the Coder,

520
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:08,090
the code has been up from like
11 to three working on code,

521
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,840
sleeves to 10 goes to class,

522
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:15,950
eat something around five and back the
coding. Right? And so I say, hey look,

523
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,120
the football player thinks, oh
we have it so tough. You know,

524
00:34:20,121 --> 00:34:22,460
we have so much time that we're
putting into our craft. I said,

525
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:26,930
you've got folks who
are coders and training.

526
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:31,100
They are spending as much if
not more time than you are.

527
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:35,240
They just don't have 110,000 people
cheering them on on Saturdays.

528
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:38,600
So you're both putting a
lot of time into your craft.

529
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:43,580
Let's find ways to kind of bridge the
gap between student athletes and non

530
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:47,180
athletes. So it's been, it's been
fun. They keep me young. So this,

531
00:34:47,181 --> 00:34:49,820
this pivot was more so unexpected,

532
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:53,190
but it's something that it seems
to be very fulfilling. Yeah.

533
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,310
I think my life has now been,

534
00:34:56,710 --> 00:35:01,710
I'm trying to find ways to expand
the worldviews of athletes.

535
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:10,160
Football players for example, I tell
them you are mathematicians, right?

536
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:13,790
Like four quarterback to throw a ball,

537
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:19,510
45 yards to avoid two defenders over the
back shoulder of a person who's running

538
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:27,790
a four three 40 down the sideline with
the wind blowing 10 miles out of the

539
00:35:27,831 --> 00:35:32,060
West. That kind of precision,
that is very complex math.

540
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:38,400
Take that and translate it
over into Algebra class. Right?

541
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:43,320
And they see these worlds as being two
separate spheres and everything that

542
00:35:43,321 --> 00:35:47,220
we're doing is trying to break down
these barriers to say, you know,

543
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:51,570
when you give the speech at halftime
that helps your team to come back from a

544
00:35:51,571 --> 00:35:52,404
deficit.

545
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,700
That's crisis management like that has
an application in the private sector.

546
00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:00,630
Don't see it as, oh, I
was just, yeah, exactly.

547
00:36:00,631 --> 00:36:04,170
This is what I would need to do outside
of that. Yeah, exactly. So let's,

548
00:36:04,171 --> 00:36:07,530
let's bring those lessons
for in any sport really,

549
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:10,920
and translate those over into
life away from sports. Sure.

550
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:15,110
Um, can you talk about your story
about how Kevin Durant fits and all,

551
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:15,890
all of this?

552
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:18,500
Yeah. So Kevin Duran,
so Kevin Durant's, um,

553
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:23,920
spent one year at the University of
Texas was one and done and has such an

554
00:36:25,611 --> 00:36:28,220
appreciation for that time.
Like, and when you talk to him,

555
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,770
he looks at that one year sort
of as the calm before the storm,

556
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:38,100
right. And was a phenom
out of Maryland. Um,

557
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:43,010
in 2015 he started thinking about how
he could have a better relationship with

558
00:36:43,011 --> 00:36:45,710
the university.
And so

559
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,580
we're having conversations
with his agent and said, hey,

560
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:54,890
how about you come to campus,
make a speech? And he was like,

561
00:36:54,891 --> 00:36:57,980
no, we'd rather do a one on
one conversation. And so we'd,

562
00:36:57,981 --> 00:37:01,580
we did this talk and we just talked
through how much he loves mom,

563
00:37:01,581 --> 00:37:02,720
which I think is incredible.

564
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:08,140
He talked about the fact that he thinks
that there's such a deficit of love and

565
00:37:08,661 --> 00:37:13,661
people who are willing to be vulnerable
and that he's trying to help people

566
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:18,560
build a comfort level with
that. Um, and then he,

567
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:20,180
he talked about,
hey,

568
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:24,830
I want to find ways to be more supportive
of what we're doing on campus for our

569
00:37:24,831 --> 00:37:28,430
athletes.
And so he's been a supporter.

570
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:32,090
Wrote a nice check to us.
Yeah. You weeks ago. Thank you.

571
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,730
Thank you. It was a nice check it. Yes.

572
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:39,430
$1 million that Kevin Durant donated to
the center that Darrin founded. So big.

573
00:37:39,431 --> 00:37:40,990
Congratulations. Thank you. Appreciate it.

574
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:47,210
And if anyone wants the magic,
hey,

575
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:51,260
tell us whatever. We got it
all. I think there was a hand.

576
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:57,810
Yes. I got the little swipe,
a little stripe thing. Um,
so yeah, it's been great.

577
00:37:57,850 --> 00:38:01,380
We've been able to really read a lot of
students and we're going to be a little

578
00:38:01,381 --> 00:38:05,280
more ambitious now with some
of our offerings and we're
moving into that period

579
00:38:05,281 --> 00:38:08,250
when we're scaling beyond
the University of Texas. So

580
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:12,130
amazing. Yeah. Well. Um, I
also want to let you know, um,

581
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:15,920
we'll have some time for questions. So
if you want to just line up at the mics,

582
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,820
um, have a few more things to ask, stare,

583
00:38:17,821 --> 00:38:21,210
but please also feel comfortable
to ask him anything you want. Take,

584
00:38:21,211 --> 00:38:24,450
take the risk, the risk,
the pledge, Darrin. Okay.

585
00:38:24,451 --> 00:38:28,350
Now we talked about [inaudible] now our
other favorite topic. Donuts, right?

586
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:34,350
What is with you and Dona? Yeah, yeah.
And what is with this doughnut council.

587
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,130
So

588
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:42,030
I realize that I needed to be very
intentional about spending time with my

589
00:38:43,211 --> 00:38:47,680
family and I think a lot of people say,
oh, I'll spend more time on that family.

590
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:52,120
And then that's on a Sunday and
then you get to Saturday. Oh,

591
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,950
I haven't spent any time with my family.
Right.

592
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:59,730
So I went into Google calendar and
we haven't even talked to rehab it,

593
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,493
we haven't actually

594
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:08,080
course just kind of up a temperature
level a little bit outside. Um,

595
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:13,890
so my family is color code is
orange and we have every Saturday,

596
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,240
seven 30,

597
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:21,610
I take the kids and we go to a
different donut shop in Austin.

598
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:26,620
And he said there were, how many? There
are? 38. Okay. Is that more than New York?

599
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:30,340
It's crazy. It's crazy. It's crazy.
It's like, and what's happened,

600
00:39:30,341 --> 00:39:33,640
this has been going on for four years.
My aunt, my mom does embroidery,

601
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:37,450
so we've got tee shirts. I mean we
walk in and people are like, oh,

602
00:39:37,451 --> 00:39:40,210
doughnut council. Hey,
copy a few, you know,

603
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:44,170
donuts but should have posts how you asked
for a free thing. That's right. Right.

604
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:48,960
Yeah. And now it's gotten to the
point to where my kids are becoming,

605
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:52,760
they're kind of becoming
snobs in the sense. Uh,

606
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:57,280
my daughter last week, we're
going to play, she goes, you know,

607
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,350
cinnamon rolls here a bit dry.
And which daughter is this?

608
00:40:02,351 --> 00:40:05,020
How is Sydney Sydney's five?
I'm like sitting in your five,

609
00:40:05,021 --> 00:40:09,490
just eat the damn thing. It's nice.
Like it's not as much as donut hole.

610
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:14,380
They have us just eat. Um, now I'm
spending a small mortgage. Right?

611
00:40:14,381 --> 00:40:18,490
It started out, oh, half
a dozen donut holes here.

612
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:21,280
Have Fun people want,
you know,

613
00:40:21,281 --> 00:40:24,750
bear claws and chocolate sprinkles.

614
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:28,900
So yes, our off three,
now we have five. Um,

615
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:32,950
and thank you long seven months.

616
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:37,030
And he's just trying to like get some
of the residue from the donut hole,

617
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,250
look at himself.

618
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:44,670
But it's also a great time for accurate
back with him around 11 so my wife can

619
00:40:44,681 --> 00:40:48,280
just go and be childless for a while.
I mean,

620
00:40:48,281 --> 00:40:52,600
she works for a nonprofit and also
helps with kids. And so she's,

621
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,220
it's good to kind of give her some space,

622
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:57,460
but we're at it for four years
and it's been, it's been fun.

623
00:40:57,461 --> 00:41:02,440
So if anyone wants to donate to
the donut council, half $1 million,

624
00:41:02,441 --> 00:41:06,360
half a million dollars, we'll go.
We'll go a hell of a long way. Yeah.

625
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:09,140
Maybe with the bear claws it'd be
like, yeah, yeah. With the brick house.

626
00:41:09,141 --> 00:41:10,540
So now we're actually thinking,

627
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:14,320
my oldest wants to make a
pivot to breakfast tacos.

628
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:19,600
So you got to have new embroidery tee
shirts from grandma. We have bylaws.

629
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:22,870
Um,
I have veto authority.

630
00:41:22,871 --> 00:41:26,680
I'm one of the permanent members and yeah,
self appointed.

631
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:30,700
I'm not sure I feel about, I mean we are
in Austin, Texas, right? So there's a,

632
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:33,590
there's a breakfast Taco in every corner.
Um,

633
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,790
but it kind of seems a little different.
Right? Different. It's not quite so,

634
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:43,180
yeah. So it's been a great way to
spend time with the kids and um,

635
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:46,040
it'll be fun because my, my
son was talking about, oh,

636
00:41:46,041 --> 00:41:47,720
when I have kids I want
to do the same thing.

637
00:41:47,721 --> 00:41:50,240
So it'll be neat to see
the grandkids doing that.

638
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:53,810
So I mean, the coolest part
for me about, you know,

639
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,380
hearing about the donut consultant,

640
00:41:55,420 --> 00:42:00,420
why I wanted to talk about it today is
it's not just go eat doughnuts with dad.

641
00:42:00,571 --> 00:42:04,890
It's, you talk about real
lessons. Can you share a little,

642
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:08,320
yeah.
So we talked through current events.

643
00:42:08,321 --> 00:42:12,700
I usually pick a one current event and
then I'll put pick one character trait.

644
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:13,630
Right.

645
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:18,630
And so a couple of weeks ago was
gratitude and we talked about the value of

646
00:42:18,971 --> 00:42:23,200
saying thank you and I'll have
them kind of think about, hey,

647
00:42:23,201 --> 00:42:26,860
when was the last time you said thank you?
So Sydney,

648
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:28,300
you can tell Sydney
kind of runs the house.

649
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:33,660
Sidney said she got an extra slice of
pizza at school and she told the lady at

650
00:42:34,601 --> 00:42:37,030
the cafeteria, thank you. Right. I
was like, well, how'd you get to act?

651
00:42:37,031 --> 00:42:40,450
Just like it because oh well she knows
I really liked this cheese that they

652
00:42:40,451 --> 00:42:43,930
don't normally have. And she gave me
an extra one. It's not dry. You know,

653
00:42:43,931 --> 00:42:46,960
she's very particular about
our food. Um, and I say, well,

654
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:50,260
how do you think she fell? She fell.
She gave me a big smile. Right?

655
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:55,650
So we talk about how there are these
things called soft skills that people talk

656
00:42:56,141 --> 00:42:59,500
about that's completely off their hard.

657
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:04,960
And these are the skills that will
get you fired. Hired governments,

658
00:43:04,961 --> 00:43:08,770
fall, country's fall, right? Like
just truth and integrity. Um,

659
00:43:08,771 --> 00:43:12,760
so they're very important in their
heart and we have to be very intentional

660
00:43:12,761 --> 00:43:17,710
about, you know, talking about
them. So, um, yeah, they,

661
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:23,310
they're really, now they had their
own topics. Right now they're,

662
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:25,210
they're starting to bring him to like,
Hey,

663
00:43:25,211 --> 00:43:30,211
can we talk about movies and how
we can get more time on the IPAD?

664
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:34,890
And I'm like, no, it doesn't really fit
in with the scalp veto power done. Right?

665
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,800
Yes. Yeah. It's not a soft skill is
fit. So it's been, it's been a blast.

666
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:39,893
So how do you,

667
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:44,900
I mean you are teaching students
and athletes how to take risks.

668
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:48,270
Yeah. Are you starting to teach
that to your children and if so,

669
00:43:48,271 --> 00:43:49,290
how are you doing that?

670
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:50,331
Yes,

671
00:43:50,331 --> 00:43:55,331
so I'm going to start this year actually
to kind of going through the rejection

672
00:43:55,441 --> 00:43:58,620
resume. I'm gonna Start Broadcasting when
I want to get turned down from things.

673
00:43:58,690 --> 00:43:59,910
So I picked,

674
00:43:59,911 --> 00:44:03,030
I've been going through a two weeks
cycle with the Harvard business review,

675
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:08,070
pitching them as article about Superbowl
winning coaches and focus and how CEOs

676
00:44:08,071 --> 00:44:12,780
can do the same thing and got so close.
And she finally was like, yeah, right.

677
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:15,030
What's like I took a
screenshot of the email.

678
00:44:15,031 --> 00:44:18,600
I thought I'd just put us out on social
media without her information and say

679
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:23,400
got turned down by Harvard
Business Review. But you
know what? It just helps me.

680
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:28,350
I think the thing with rejection is
you can't, you can't take it personal,

681
00:44:28,351 --> 00:44:33,240
but you have to make it personal in
the sense I have to dissect the entire

682
00:44:33,241 --> 00:44:37,440
process. Did I give her enough time
that I really flesh out the proposal?

683
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:42,270
Could it have been more succinct?
And then use that for round number two.

684
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:44,310
So,
um,

685
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:49,440
with them we've been talking
about entrepreneurship
and our home and so my kid

686
00:44:49,441 --> 00:44:52,500
said, hey, you know how you
stuff all those Christmas cards,

687
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:57,390
we want to start a business where people
will send their unstuffed cards to us.

688
00:44:58,170 --> 00:44:58,770
Right.
I've got,

689
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:03,770
I've got like a legion right of hands
and we'll stop at for them and uh,

690
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:06,150
and mail them off.
I thought that's pretty good.

691
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,590
So my wife and I have talked about
having some sort of entrepreneurial theme

692
00:45:10,591 --> 00:45:14,790
this year where we help them get
something off the ground. Yeah.

693
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:19,100
Well we can't wait to see what you do
next and what your kids, certainly Sydney.

694
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:22,830
Yes. Watch out for Sydney.
You think we have a question?

695
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,620
Hey there.
Um,

696
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:29,900
so I have a thought that I haven't fully
thought through yet and it just wanted

697
00:45:29,901 --> 00:45:34,610
to see if maybe something you've thought
about, but how do you address like this,

698
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:39,800
um, you know, a person or you
know, whatever that's like coming,

699
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,800
you know,
acting like a person who is risk averse,

700
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:48,020
but perhaps their risk aversion comes
from a place of needing to be perfect.

701
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,610
Or, you know, when we talk about kids
and you know, I dunno when we grow up,

702
00:45:52,611 --> 00:45:54,560
we talked about practice makes perfect.

703
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,080
Now I make a deliberate attempt
to tell him my daughter, like,

704
00:45:57,081 --> 00:45:58,490
practice makes progress.

705
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:03,470
But I feel like a lot of us were raised
to think about being really perfect.

706
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:07,400
And I feel like when I think about
myself that I'm very risk averse.

707
00:46:07,401 --> 00:46:12,401
But I wonder if a lot of my risk aversion
comes from this like psychology of

708
00:46:12,681 --> 00:46:17,320
being raised to try to be perfect.
If that's something that you,

709
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:19,580
what was your name?
Catty.

710
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:23,050
First thing I want to steal
that practice makes progress.

711
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:26,320
So if you see it in another form
and now I'm just taking it from you,

712
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,350
it's yours.
Secondly,

713
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:35,380
so I was like Amazon last week and
one of their 14, I hope this is okay.

714
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:40,270
One of their 14 leadership
principles is a bias for action.

715
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,860
And I've adopted this massive
action thing for the year.

716
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:47,380
I deal with 300 freshmen a year.

717
00:46:47,381 --> 00:46:52,381
And the helicopter parent phenomenon is
a very real thing where they land at the

718
00:46:53,411 --> 00:46:58,300
University of Texas and it's gotta be
a foro highest honors President of this

719
00:46:58,301 --> 00:47:01,310
club in the right dorm.
Like, you know, the,

720
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:03,700
the color of the bed
sheets have to be perfect.

721
00:47:03,701 --> 00:47:05,320
Like everything has to be perfected.

722
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,770
So I'm constantly talking about them,

723
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:11,750
talking with him about imperfections and,

724
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:15,460
and also trying to get them to
favor action and to say, listen,

725
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,740
all you want is more data.

726
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:22,510
So if you wait to build this thing
until you have it all, would you,

727
00:47:22,511 --> 00:47:26,230
will you think perfectly prepared?
You have,

728
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:30,160
you've kept herself from collecting the
data that would've gotten if you were

729
00:47:30,161 --> 00:47:34,360
just throwing a Beta version
out there. Right. And so, um,

730
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,270
I think we do feel like,

731
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:41,440
and I think it's sort of this Instagram
culture of I need the right filter.

732
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:44,470
And the lighting and the angle
and then I'm going to post,

733
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:49,570
we've taken that approach and sort of
translated over into our professional

734
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:54,040
lives and I'm a big believer in
just throw something out there,

735
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:58,450
get the feedback, go for version two. Um,

736
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,100
because I think that's holding us back.

737
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:04,690
We have tenure projects that could
have been two year projects because we

738
00:48:04,691 --> 00:48:07,960
haven't been willing to put something
into the marketplace and just let the

739
00:48:07,961 --> 00:48:11,770
market speak for itself. So it's
a real thing. I think that um,

740
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:17,280
the more that we can just say this
doesn't have to be completed when I let go

741
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:23,070
that I want to take that data and a and
use it to make it better so they have a

742
00:48:23,081 --> 00:48:24,190
good point.
Thank you.

743
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:26,110
Thanks for coming. Yeah, thank you.

744
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:31,360
I'm curious about your choice to get
into coaching versus something that might

745
00:48:31,361 --> 00:48:34,070
have been like a more natural fit
with your Harvard law background,

746
00:48:34,071 --> 00:48:35,570
like front office type work.

747
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:40,820
The goal was to do something really far
outside your wheelhouse or if you did

748
00:48:40,821 --> 00:48:42,890
consider that and just that
wasn't where the passion.

749
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,610
Yeah. So and it's interesting
you say that your name again.

750
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:48,980
Todd is interesting you
say that because Todd,

751
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:53,390
I had the coaches on my staff say when
I first walked in the Kansas City,

752
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:58,370
oh you should go the GM track. Right? Like
[inaudible] you be a better, you know,

753
00:48:58,371 --> 00:49:00,590
better suit of GM.
Um,

754
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:05,950
I liked the challenge of
starting something I play
in high school like I said,

755
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,840
but I didn't have any coaching knowledge.
Right.

756
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:14,200
And I liked the challenge of
having to learn a new code.

757
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:17,840
It's a language that was
more exciting for me.

758
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:21,770
Been sort of doing something
that resembled a bit of
what I had invested three

759
00:49:21,771 --> 00:49:24,260
years and I say like we need to,

760
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:28,190
I'm constantly looking for
ways to stay in over my head.

761
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:32,330
And I thought that the GM
track made too much sense.

762
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:35,720
I really want to stretch my
mind in a different direction.

763
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:39,170
And I'll tell you what,
when you have, you have 25,

764
00:49:39,171 --> 00:49:43,430
26 year old men who are 65,
240 pounds running four three,

765
00:49:43,431 --> 00:49:48,140
eight forties, you know, flat
footed jumping 46 inches.

766
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:53,200
And you have to tell them the
routes to run on a certain play.

767
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:59,090
Like it takes a lot of courage to look,
look up at this guy and saying,

768
00:49:59,091 --> 00:50:00,740
this is what you need to do.
Right.

769
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:04,520
And I knew that was going to stretch me
more than the office side of the job.

770
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:07,910
And the last point is,

771
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:11,810
what's ironic is it's
made me a better teacher.

772
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:13,720
Okay.

773
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:18,220
Dealing with athletes for seven
years has helped me, I think to be

774
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:24,570
a fairly good teacher in the
classroom. So, um, it was a thought,

775
00:50:24,571 --> 00:50:28,190
but then I sort of dismissed it and
went for coaching. Yeah. Thanks Todd.

776
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:31,920
My name's Corey. Yeah, I
got it. And a question. Yes.

777
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:35,560
So if you're ever in Atlanta,
checkout sublime donuts. Oh,

778
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:36,900
best doughnuts in the city.

779
00:50:36,970 --> 00:50:41,110
Oh, I would agree. We were, a few of us
were just there, you know, he didn't call.

780
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:45,280
Thanks. Look, you're getting me
in trouble. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

781
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:46,221
Chin.

782
00:50:46,221 --> 00:50:50,520
Kind of this idea of like when you were
talking about the illustration of the CS

783
00:50:50,521 --> 00:50:54,360
students and the athlete and these kind
of two worlds combining with sports and

784
00:50:54,450 --> 00:50:55,590
the outside world.
Yeah,

785
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:00,630
I feel like we're in a place where
there's very interesting things happening

786
00:51:00,631 --> 00:51:03,270
with sports technology and those
kind of two fields together.

787
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:07,560
So I'm wondering if you've seen anything
happen on like ut campus or other

788
00:51:07,561 --> 00:51:12,090
campuses or your program is working
with any programs to not only, um,

789
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:17,130
get the technology into the athlete's
hands to have them using it on the field

790
00:51:17,131 --> 00:51:17,940
or in practice,

791
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:22,170
but also teaching them about
the technology so they can
get interested in it and

792
00:51:22,171 --> 00:51:24,580
maybe change it for the
better to help future. Yeah.

793
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:29,490
Yes. So Cory, great first great
tip and then on the sublime.

794
00:51:29,491 --> 00:51:30,660
And then great question.

795
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:35,930
So we're actually in the
fall we're unveiling a sports
entrepreneurship sequence

796
00:51:37,711 --> 00:51:40,950
at the business school.
So we're going to have 20 athletes,

797
00:51:40,951 --> 00:51:45,951
20 non athletes and they will
start it ideation all the way to,

798
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:47,461
you know,

799
00:51:47,461 --> 00:51:51,480
putting the thing into the marketplace
a year long course and we'll bring in

800
00:51:51,481 --> 00:51:55,210
sports entrepreneurs to expose them to,
you know,

801
00:51:55,230 --> 00:51:59,520
this thing that we call entrepreneurship.
I think you're spot on because it's,

802
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:03,030
it's been relatively recent that people
have kind of looked around and said,

803
00:52:03,031 --> 00:52:05,190
wait,
we can test.

804
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:08,490
Instead of waiting for
the data to come back,

805
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:13,670
we can just use the on the field data
from practice and from training camps to

806
00:52:14,191 --> 00:52:16,540
inform the way that we build products.
Um,

807
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:20,850
and you actually have a couple of
athletic departments that are considering

808
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:23,970
building inhouse incubators.
Um,

809
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:28,600
so you see this with the 70 sixers for
example, um, where they're just say,

810
00:52:28,601 --> 00:52:33,210
let's just bring this in house because
we have world class athletes to get good

811
00:52:33,211 --> 00:52:34,170
feedback from,

812
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:39,390
let's use this setting as a space where
we can ideate and then test out new

813
00:52:39,391 --> 00:52:39,931
concepts.

814
00:52:39,931 --> 00:52:43,890
So I think this is really on the next
few years that this concept we're really,

815
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:48,630
really take off. Yeah. Thank
you Cory. I was good. Let's go.

816
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:51,210
Hi Darren.
Um,

817
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:56,230
my name is Veronica and I am
seeing in my field of expertise,

818
00:52:56,781 --> 00:53:00,860
which is employment law, that at the
higher levels of corporate America,

819
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:05,590
especially, you know, we're dealing with
like c suite folks and the leaders in, um,

820
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:06,930
the companies,
uh,

821
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,930
that the soft skills that you alluded
to earlier directly contribute to the

822
00:53:11,931 --> 00:53:15,350
breakdown of and meltdown
of workplace relationships.

823
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:19,400
So in your talks and your
trainings with those leaders,

824
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:24,650
what kind of response are you getting
from those leaders when you talk to them

825
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,340
about skills?
Like

826
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:27,570
vulnerability or,

827
00:53:27,790 --> 00:53:32,500
yeah,
so at first they walk in and it's,

828
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:37,420
Hr has put this thing together and they've
got to go get real mushy for an hour,

829
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:41,740
right? So they own, they don't want
to be there. And then we really,

830
00:53:41,950 --> 00:53:43,420
especially with vulnerability,

831
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:48,840
first I'll show them the research that
says for managers who score high on the

832
00:53:49,481 --> 00:53:53,500
vulnerability scale, their teams produce
more, like all the things you care about,

833
00:53:53,501 --> 00:53:57,550
revenue and shareholder.
All of those measures go up.

834
00:53:58,090 --> 00:54:02,710
And it's counterintuitive. But the
reason is the team members say, Oh,

835
00:54:02,711 --> 00:54:07,711
if she has the confidence to be
vulnerable and there are some limits,

836
00:54:08,081 --> 00:54:09,400
right?
But to be vulnerable,

837
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:14,020
it creates this safe space and they
feel more comfortable and they actually

838
00:54:14,021 --> 00:54:18,250
produce more and better
products and ideas and concepts.

839
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:21,370
So at first have to get them
to buy in that there's this,

840
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:26,580
there's this very real bottom line benefit
to being in using vulnerability and

841
00:54:28,931 --> 00:54:32,380
empathy. And then I used that
hook to then say, hey listen,

842
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:36,550
it's also just good as a human right?
Like empathy,

843
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:39,790
the ability to take the
perspective of someone else.

844
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,140
If there is anything that's in short
supply right now and our country in the

845
00:54:44,141 --> 00:54:46,870
world, like it's, it's to be
empathy, right? Because we're all,

846
00:54:47,590 --> 00:54:51,190
we know the right answers. We know what
everyone should be doing. It's a black,

847
00:54:51,191 --> 00:54:54,850
white, it's a very binary
world and a lot of us live in.

848
00:54:55,570 --> 00:55:00,490
But to be able to stop and say,
I'm not from the same hometown,

849
00:55:00,491 --> 00:55:02,290
we're not the same race or religion,

850
00:55:02,291 --> 00:55:07,291
but I can see how she would arrive
at this feeling or conclusion.

851
00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:11,050
I think that's, that's important.
It's an uphill battle though, I think,

852
00:55:11,051 --> 00:55:15,640
especially in corporate America,
vulnerability, empathy or our Tufts sales.

853
00:55:15,641 --> 00:55:16,870
But we're working,

854
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:22,660
let's take one last question and then
you can come and stare at a few more

855
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:23,493
afterwards.

856
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:28,930
My name's Zack. I'm curious, you
know, in the two pivots that happen,

857
00:55:28,931 --> 00:55:31,150
they kind of came at natural points,

858
00:55:31,151 --> 00:55:35,290
I would say as far as you graduated
and then maybe unnatural, but you know,

859
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:40,240
you were fired or let go. Um,
I'm curious, outside of that,

860
00:55:40,330 --> 00:55:43,840
how often do you kind of
reevaluate where you are,

861
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:49,470
whether there's something else you could
be doing that would expand your impact

862
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:53,020
and, and moreover, you know, you've
done a bunch of different things.

863
00:55:53,021 --> 00:55:55,000
You've coached,
you know,

864
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:59,830
a group of say 10 folks and your and
your 10 guys in your receiver group or

865
00:55:59,831 --> 00:56:02,890
whatever. Um, and now you're
directing this big thing.

866
00:56:03,370 --> 00:56:08,350
How do you compare those different
options and evaluate impact in all these

867
00:56:08,351 --> 00:56:08,790
different,

868
00:56:08,790 --> 00:56:13,020
yeah, man, Zach and just got
right to the heart of it.

869
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:19,980
That's the process. Like
right now, this is where I am.

870
00:56:20,190 --> 00:56:24,730
So I'll talk about staying
in over your head. I am,

871
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:30,490
I'm constantly thinking now, like,
am I challenging myself enough? Yeah.

872
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:34,870
Um, I, my, if I get
comfortable, it gets a little,

873
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:39,640
I'm on edge and I felt like I may
be getting that point right. Um,

874
00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:45,810
I'm also at the point where I have
determined for me that my life needs to

875
00:56:46,391 --> 00:56:51,070
consist of writing,
speaking, and teaching.

876
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,030
And if I think about the commonality
between coaching and what I do in the

877
00:56:55,031 --> 00:56:58,810
classroom, it's the teaching piece.
Yeah. That's the common thread.

878
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:03,700
So now that I've identified
that subset of what I need,

879
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:09,340
I'm going to filter any opportunity
that comes across my plate through those

880
00:57:09,341 --> 00:57:11,920
three. It needs to go three for
three, you know, I'm going to be 40.

881
00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:16,060
I can't go to for three. I need
a three for three set up. Um,

882
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:17,830
okay.

883
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:22,270
But I even don't know if I'm,
if I'm really challenging
myself enough right now.

884
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:26,860
Yeah. Um, so I'm actively thinking about
that and if you have some answers for me,

885
00:57:26,861 --> 00:57:29,380
I will take that.
I'll pay you for them.

886
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:34,100
But I think it's a question that people
who want to be intentional about their

887
00:57:34,101 --> 00:57:37,970
lives, they're constantly
asking that question. So
thank you. Thank you for that.

888
00:57:37,971 --> 00:57:38,804
Thank you.

889
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,600
Well, Darren, thank you so much
for spending time with you, Ashley,

890
00:57:41,610 --> 00:57:45,540
sharing your story. Um, I
have one quick question.

891
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:48,390
We really want really quick.
Superbowl Sunday.

892
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,970
Oh Lord Eagles by three

893
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:57,620
[inaudible].
