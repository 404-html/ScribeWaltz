1
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:10,860
That is very

2
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,810
nice. Welcome. Very nice. I appreciate
it. Very spontaneous. So thank you.

3
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:18,320
Thanks Jess for having me here
today. I appreciate it. Um,

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,260
so what I wanted to chat a little bit
with you guys about today and an end.

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,090
First of all, thank you for having
me here. I'm excited to be here. Um,

6
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:31,010
is the importance of bravery in marketing
and why that's so important really in

7
00:00:31,011 --> 00:00:35,370
today's marketing landscape
and in the world that is, um,

8
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:40,190
really so focused on
technology and data and um,

9
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:44,120
how we intercept kind of the,
the art and the science of marketing.

10
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:48,590
And if you look at just the
technical definition of bravery,

11
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:53,420
it's this idea of the quality or state
of having or showing mental or moral

12
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:56,870
strength to face danger,
fear or difficulty.

13
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,190
So those are really powerful words when
you think about them in the business

14
00:01:01,191 --> 00:01:04,820
context,
but from the lens of a Cmo,

15
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:08,150
why are they so important? Well, they're
important for a number of reasons.

16
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:12,620
First and foremost, the CMO seat,
especially these days, is a hot seat.

17
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:18,010
The average tenure for a CMO is 18
months according to a recent study.

18
00:01:18,171 --> 00:01:21,400
And I'm going to talk a little
bit more about this, but, um,

19
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:26,530
80% of CEOs actually say that they
don't trust their CMO and we'll get into

20
00:01:27,891 --> 00:01:30,830
that.
But having bravery is a path forward.

21
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,820
This idea of kind of facing danger,
fear or difficulty,

22
00:01:34,821 --> 00:01:38,570
I think aligns really well with
this idea that I'm talking about.

23
00:01:38,571 --> 00:01:43,571
And I think in a world where people are
so overwhelmed with choice and people

24
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:49,670
have so little time in their day anymore
that you have to be brave to break

25
00:01:49,671 --> 00:01:53,480
through. And as marketers, that's
what we're really trying to do.

26
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:58,510
We're trying to break through and make
an emotional engagements with people.

27
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:01,190
And it's more difficult than ever before.

28
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:06,410
And I think we know a little bit about
bravery. If you think about my company,

29
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,270
ally financial and what we did.

30
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:13,310
So think about the fact that like you
guys were a pretty young company 10 years

31
00:02:13,311 --> 00:02:16,340
ago. We didn't even exist,
which is hard to believe.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And what we did is we launched in the
worst financial crisis since the Great

33
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,820
Depression.
We were spun off from General Motors,

34
00:02:25,821 --> 00:02:28,400
we were GMS captive auto finance company.

35
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:32,750
And GM was going through its
bankruptcy and needed liquidity.

36
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:37,810
And so the idea was to sell the captive
and all of a sudden we found ourselves

37
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:43,810
in a marketplace where we
had been engineered and built
to do one thing and that

38
00:02:44,691 --> 00:02:47,960
was to serve auto loans to GM dealers.

39
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:53,320
Suddenly we're in this complete financial
crisis where is markets are crashing

40
00:02:54,111 --> 00:02:58,880
down. There's no access to liquidity.
We have no mothership anymore. Gm has,

41
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:04,770
and we had to change or die and we had
thousands of people that were depending

42
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:09,640
on us as employees of ally,
but bigger than that,

43
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:14,170
we had 17,000 dealers that were
dependent on us to survive.

44
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:19,770
And we had really the responsibility of
a huge impact on the American economy if

45
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,920
GMHC went down.

46
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:29,580
And so what we had to do is start from
scratch and we had to rethink the way

47
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:32,440
that we were going to
go to market completely.

48
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:37,330
And we really felt like there's this
huge opportunity and everybody was saying

49
00:03:37,331 --> 00:03:39,790
to us, what are you going
to do? And our thought was,

50
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:43,930
we're going to launch a bank and the
bank is going to become the deposit

51
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:48,550
gathering capability that will fund the
auto loans and we'll kind of reinvent

52
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,310
ourselves to be able to
have the ability to do that.

53
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,280
And we're not going to
just create a normal bank.

54
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:58,570
We're going to create a
digital bank because we needed
to get to market quickly.

55
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:03,870
We didn't have time for infrastructure
to build brick and mortar locations and

56
00:04:04,361 --> 00:04:09,361
we were on a very short timeframe in
order to be able to start generating

57
00:04:09,851 --> 00:04:11,920
revenue before our liquidity ran out.

58
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:16,060
It kind of complicating that is
the government came to us and said,

59
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:20,020
we're going to close down Chrysler
capital and we want you to take on all the

60
00:04:20,021 --> 00:04:21,370
Chrysler dealers as well.

61
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,750
So that added significant pressure to
our timeline and to what it was that we

62
00:04:25,751 --> 00:04:29,070
needed to do. And everybody
was saying a bank, you know,

63
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,120
the world doesn't need another bank.

64
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,340
That's the last thing anybody
wants is another bank.

65
00:04:33,341 --> 00:04:36,310
And our mantra at the time
was this notion that yeah,

66
00:04:36,311 --> 00:04:38,950
the world doesn't need another
bank but it needs a better bank.

67
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,880
And we took this bet that
everybody would be banking, uh,

68
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,560
in the palm of their hand.
Now it seems really intuitive now,

69
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,090
10 years later,

70
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:54,270
as you watch all these big companies
scramble to get to digital financial

71
00:04:54,881 --> 00:04:57,040
services solutions.
But 10 years ago,

72
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,740
there was nobody out in
the category like us.

73
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:05,350
We also saw a ton of pain points
in the category. You know,

74
00:05:05,351 --> 00:05:07,600
people were either completely apathetic,

75
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:11,050
they weren't paying any attention to
how their banks, we're treating them.

76
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,710
And if you think about
it in a lot of ways,

77
00:05:14,711 --> 00:05:17,170
we were putting up with
things that as consumers,

78
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,270
we shouldn't be putting up with.
Like,

79
00:05:19,271 --> 00:05:23,620
why should I pay $5 to get
my money out of the wall?

80
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,190
Think about it. You still do
it today. Why do I have money?

81
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,570
My money sitting at a bank that
doesn't pay any interest on my savings?

82
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,000
People still do it today.
You know,

83
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:38,710
why can't I have 24 by seven service?
Money is a really important thing.

84
00:05:38,711 --> 00:05:40,180
I work really hard for my money.

85
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:45,070
My family depends on my money yet if
it's past five o'clock or six o'clock and

86
00:05:45,071 --> 00:05:48,790
something happens, I can't talk
to anybody at a bank. You know,

87
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:52,750
why is everything so confusing?
Why is the jargon so confusing?

88
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:57,560
Why do banks purposely try and
confuse you and hide things from you,

89
00:05:57,561 --> 00:06:00,890
whether they're hidden fees,
kind of this bait and switch mentality.

90
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:06,020
So a lot of pain points and we really
felt like there was this huge opportunity

91
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:09,380
and a better way forward.
And that really is what created ally.

92
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,890
So literally in a six
month period of time,

93
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,710
back during that financial crisis,

94
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:20,480
a very small group of us pretty much
spent the whole entire summer in New York

95
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:23,900
with a branding company
and an advertising agency.

96
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:29,150
And we came up with what we thought
was a better way forward and we created

97
00:06:29,151 --> 00:06:32,120
ally.
The launch was really different.

98
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,430
We really took on the big banks.

99
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,070
What we wanted to do was kind
of create this awakening.

100
00:06:37,071 --> 00:06:41,930
We wanted to reach out and shake people
and get them to pay attention and get

101
00:06:41,931 --> 00:06:44,450
them to pay attention to what
was happening in the category.

102
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,150
And also what was paying what
was happening to their money.

103
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,580
And so we launched in a really loud
and disruptive way. And you know,

104
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:56,660
as a marketer at the time,
this was really a brave campaign.

105
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,900
And I'll talk a little bit about um,
how it did.

106
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,990
I'll talk a little bit about some of
the reaction and some of the things that

107
00:07:02,991 --> 00:07:07,550
occurred as a result. But the whole
business model itself was brave,

108
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:10,940
but also the way that we came to market
I think is a great example of that.

109
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:16,190
So let me play a couple of spots that
you guys may or may not remember.

110
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,230
This is the way that ally came to market.

111
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:23,610
Have some fun with that
truck. Okay. Times up.

112
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:30,090
Here you go. That's a
nice one. I made that

113
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,470
we can have the red truck seat.
That was a limited time offer only.

114
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,090
It's right here in the fine print.

115
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,290
Even kids know what's wrong,
not in fine print.

116
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,540
Why don't banks were allied a new bank?

117
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,450
Who's Rachel always be among the top
with nothing buried in the fine print.

118
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,770
It's just the right thing to do.

119
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:51,960
What'd you like a pony?

120
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,380
Would you like a pony?
Yeah.

121
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:01,603
Here you go.

122
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:12,923
Hold out on somebody.

123
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:17,360
Why don't banks were ally the new big
that alerts you when your money can be

124
00:08:17,361 --> 00:08:19,970
working harder and burning more.
It's just the right thing to do.

125
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:25,910
So a really bold way to come to market
in a category that had always done,

126
00:08:25,911 --> 00:08:29,570
just really boring,
really plain type of advertising.

127
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,310
Everything about what we did was
brave. Um, including the color, right?

128
00:08:34,311 --> 00:08:38,930
A purple bank. I mean what we
did is we put up on the wall,

129
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,130
all bank advertising and everything
was either red, white, or blue.

130
00:08:43,131 --> 00:08:46,130
If you think about it, like look around
today, you'll see the same thing.

131
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,400
And so we thought, we want to stand
out. We're going to be a digital bank.

132
00:08:49,401 --> 00:08:53,210
We want to do something different. And
we chose the color purple. You know,

133
00:08:53,211 --> 00:08:54,050
the spots.

134
00:08:54,051 --> 00:08:59,051
The idea was RJ represented the big banks
and we wanted to clearly call out how

135
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:05,001
dishonorably banks were behaving and
the fact that even little kids recognize

136
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:09,480
when something is wrong, everything
was shot, hidden camera. Um,

137
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,980
all the cameramen were in those,

138
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:14,160
those play structures that you kind
of saw in the background there.

139
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,910
The kids thought that they were coming
in for focus groups and we get real

140
00:09:17,911 --> 00:09:22,140
reactions and um, you know,
they just, they just blew up.

141
00:09:22,141 --> 00:09:23,730
I mean it resonated.

142
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:27,270
It created that emotional
connection with people right away.

143
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:31,290
I remember shooting the one with pony and
we shot a bunch of different kids just

144
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:35,450
to get the best reactions.
And we shot these two sisters and um,

145
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:40,050
they came in and they did the, you know,
Rj did the, do you want a pony? Yes.

146
00:09:40,051 --> 00:09:40,890
Do you want a pony?

147
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:46,280
And I was sitting with their mom in the
green room and when the other sister got

148
00:09:46,471 --> 00:09:47,340
the real pony,

149
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,040
the other little sister turned to her
and punched her right in the face.

150
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,830
I'm like,
I really want to use that one,

151
00:09:52,831 --> 00:09:54,680
but we decided to go
with this one instead.

152
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:01,170
But it was a really great way for us to
come to market and it really helped us

153
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:06,060
build a brand and it helped us get in the,
get on the landscape very,

154
00:10:06,061 --> 00:10:07,110
very quickly.

155
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,610
And if you kind of fast forward now
10 years later and look at how we,

156
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:15,910
how we've done, it's been
unbelievable. We have um,

157
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,910
1.4 million customers of
ally bank on the auto side,

158
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,800
four and a half million customers.

159
00:10:22,801 --> 00:10:26,910
So all total about five and a half
million customers that we do business with

160
00:10:26,911 --> 00:10:29,250
today in 10 years,

161
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:33,330
nine almost $95 billion in deposits.

162
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:38,280
And this is is for something where there's
no brick and mortar people are just

163
00:10:38,281 --> 00:10:43,281
interacting with us online and
we've grown to be a top 25 bank.

164
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,960
Our Bank CEO was named one of the top
10 most powerful women in banking last

165
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,440
year.

166
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,330
And we've built a company from the ground
up by being brave and going to market

167
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:59,340
in a very different way and
creating something where
we saw a ton of white space

168
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:04,580
and a ton of opportunity in a time where
there was a category that needed to be

169
00:11:05,611 --> 00:11:08,610
disrupted in a category
that needed to be shaken up.

170
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,810
The other thing that we've done along
the way is we've built this incredibly

171
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:15,570
magical brand.
And you know,

172
00:11:15,571 --> 00:11:20,571
our CEO talks about his six strategic
priorities and the one thing that he talks

173
00:11:21,871 --> 00:11:25,080
about in his priorities,
his brand as a weapon.

174
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:30,420
And I think that's a huge testament
to what we've done from a marketing

175
00:11:30,421 --> 00:11:35,310
perspective because marketing's been a
catalyst for helping build this brand and

176
00:11:35,311 --> 00:11:39,360
then having the right internal inertia,
much like you guys do,

177
00:11:39,361 --> 00:11:43,380
to back up the promise of what the
brand stands for. A couple of years ago,

178
00:11:43,381 --> 00:11:48,360
Boston consulting group did a list of
the up and coming brands to watch and it

179
00:11:48,361 --> 00:11:52,910
was um, you know, it was Hulu,
it was Tesla, it was Gopro,

180
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:56,710
it was snapchat, it was Airbnb, an ally.

181
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:02,350
No other banks on that list and know
fortune 500 companies on that list.

182
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:03,251
Last year,

183
00:12:03,251 --> 00:12:08,240
Gail and Seagal did a list of
their top disruptor brands and um,

184
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,430
same kind of list,

185
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:13,900
Uber and Grub hub and Airbnb and Spotify,

186
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:17,950
an ally.
So very different kinds of brands.

187
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:23,220
But I underscores what we've done and
how we've been disruptive and how we've

188
00:12:23,321 --> 00:12:27,850
used bravery to really create an
entirely new category on something.

189
00:12:27,851 --> 00:12:30,700
If you think about it,
that's been around for over 100 years.

190
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:36,870
So as we kind of fast forward now 10
years later and look at where we're at.

191
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:42,090
Last year we made a a big strategic pivot
and we decided that we were going to

192
00:12:43,361 --> 00:12:48,361
expand our product portfolio given
how much consumers really liked doing

193
00:12:48,641 --> 00:12:53,290
business with us on the banking side
and the fact that we only had savings

194
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:57,820
products, we wanted to expand
rapidly. So we launched,

195
00:12:57,821 --> 00:13:02,770
we bought a company and we had, we
launched an all online investing platform,

196
00:13:02,771 --> 00:13:04,930
so self directed and managed portfolios.

197
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,350
We stood up very quickly
a mortgage capability.

198
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:13,840
We partnered with another company and we
stood up a credit card and we purchased

199
00:13:13,841 --> 00:13:17,980
a company in California to do
direct to consumer auto lending,

200
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:19,630
kind of like a lending tree model,

201
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:24,370
but to have the ability to be able to
reach into consumers and not just have to

202
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:26,170
work with the dealers on indirect lending,

203
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:28,630
but give us that indirect
lending platform.

204
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:34,140
We're also in the process of completely
reinventing our auto business to be the

205
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:38,680
digital choice for dealers as dealers.
Businesses are transforming.

206
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,240
And that category is finally starting
to catch up to the rest of the retail

207
00:13:43,241 --> 00:13:44,074
world.

208
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,460
How do we power dealers so that any way
that a consumer wants to interact with

209
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:51,820
them digitally, we can be at the
center of those interactions,

210
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,430
giving them what they need
from a lending standpoint.

211
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:59,970
So this necessitated a change in pace
in terms of how we were going to market.

212
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:05,620
And again, we needed to be very
disruptive and we needed to be very brave.

213
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:09,160
You know, we're in a category
that spends ferociously,

214
00:14:09,161 --> 00:14:14,161
the financial services category spends
over $2 billion a year on advertising,

215
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:20,290
and we're less than 2% share of
voice in that category. So for me,

216
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:24,070
the challenge was how do we kind
of outwit, outlast, outplay,

217
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:28,000
how do we break through and do things
that are very different than what

218
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:32,440
everybody else is doing in the category?
So we repositioned ourselves,

219
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:36,850
moving to this positioning of a relentless
ally for your financial wellbeing.

220
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:42,300
And We created a campaign that we wanted
to kind of humanize ourselves since we

221
00:14:43,181 --> 00:14:46,000
didn't have brick and mortar and
people couldn't walk into a branch,

222
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,280
we wanted to do something that was fun,

223
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:52,580
something that was differentiated
that showed the people of ally being

224
00:14:52,581 --> 00:14:56,510
relentless and kind of going over
the top and doing things in a really

225
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,880
interesting way for there,
for our customers.

226
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:03,830
So we try to be disruptive and literally
everything we did we use disruptive

227
00:15:03,831 --> 00:15:04,550
creative.

228
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:08,360
I'm going to show you a couple pieces of
creative and a second really changed up

229
00:15:08,361 --> 00:15:12,140
our look in terms of our graphic
design and our visual look.

230
00:15:12,141 --> 00:15:17,141
I mean when you kind of look at this plum
and our people in the advertising and

231
00:15:17,601 --> 00:15:22,010
the headlines to have that, that
clever wit and they just broke through.

232
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:25,910
They weren't like anything else that you
were seeing in our category or really

233
00:15:25,911 --> 00:15:28,340
in any other category for that,
for that matter.

234
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,830
We used really differentiated media,

235
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,910
so we partnered with a lot of content
providers that we had never partnered with

236
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:37,850
before. You know, pop sugar and vice.

237
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:43,140
We did a really cool promotion called
Lucky Penny where we actually, um,

238
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,460
get this idea that people hate pennies.
You know,

239
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:50,180
the US government is thinking
about not minting pennies anymore.

240
00:15:50,181 --> 00:15:52,100
They stopped minting pennies and Canada.

241
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:56,390
I get them and I throw them out or you
always leave him in that little jar at

242
00:15:56,391 --> 00:15:58,850
the convenience store cause no
one wants to carry them around.

243
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,630
And so we wanted to create something
interesting around this idea that a penny

244
00:16:02,631 --> 00:16:07,631
saved is a penny earned and that even
the smallest amount of savings can go a

245
00:16:08,511 --> 00:16:09,344
long way.

246
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,760
And so we hid 10 pennies in
10 cities across the country,

247
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,860
each worth $1,000.

248
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:20,860
There were ally branded pennies and we
used social media to push out clues about

249
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,520
where those pennies were.

250
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:28,030
And we created this
unbelievable groundswell of
activity around people getting

251
00:16:30,021 --> 00:16:34,520
together and trying to go
find those pennies and the
stories that came out of it

252
00:16:34,521 --> 00:16:35,690
or unbelievable.

253
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:40,960
And it got so big that
Jimmy Kimmel actually did a
segment on it where Guillermo

254
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,970
actually went outside in la,

255
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:48,860
set up a tent and had people come in
where he had a sign outside that said a

256
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,790
penny for your thoughts.

257
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:54,260
And they filmed all this really funny
content of people coming in asking

258
00:16:54,261 --> 00:16:55,400
Guillermo question,

259
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:59,330
him answering the question with something
outrageous that made literally no

260
00:16:59,331 --> 00:17:03,440
sense collecting all these pennies and
then looking for the ally lucky penny.

261
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,880
So these were ways where we were able
to get our brand in front of people and

262
00:17:07,881 --> 00:17:09,950
really different and unique use of media.

263
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,770
We created a lot of really
interesting partnerships,

264
00:17:12,771 --> 00:17:16,160
partnered with influencers that we
had never partnered with before.

265
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:21,161
People like big and rich who are very
differentiated people in the country,

266
00:17:21,231 --> 00:17:24,680
music space that do things their own way.
And Danny Coker,

267
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:29,270
we sponsored ICC, um, which is the
international soccer friendlies.

268
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:34,570
We even created an entire fragrance line
around the idea that people's favorite

269
00:17:34,761 --> 00:17:36,410
smell is the smell of a new car.

270
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:41,420
So we created a line of fragrances called
new car smell and we had 15 different

271
00:17:41,421 --> 00:17:46,421
fragrances that we displayed at auto shows
that were all around this idea of SUV

272
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:50,820
smell and minivans smell.

273
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:54,600
We had people walking around auto shows
with scent strips, handing them out.

274
00:17:54,601 --> 00:17:56,670
Just like when you go
into a department store,

275
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:00,120
you had the ability on an
iPad to create your own scent.

276
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:04,590
And then we surprise 50 people from each
auto show and we actually made their

277
00:18:04,591 --> 00:18:06,030
scent and send it to them.

278
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:10,230
So really just different ways to
go out and do interesting things.

279
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:14,640
We created something called
our disruptor calendar and um,

280
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:19,230
we did things like lucky penny. We
created an APP called a splurge alert APP.

281
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:23,550
And what you did with the splurge alert
APP is you actually downloaded the app

282
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,990
and then you could go into it and you
put into the app what your financial

283
00:18:27,991 --> 00:18:28,741
Kryptonite is.

284
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:33,020
So for me it might be like
Nordstrom's or a Prada store,

285
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:35,160
car dealership or a wine store.

286
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:38,610
And then we fence those locations.

287
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,610
And every time you walked
into one of those locations,

288
00:18:41,611 --> 00:18:45,960
you got an alert from the ally splurge
alert app that would say like, Andrea,

289
00:18:45,961 --> 00:18:48,630
get the hell out of there. Last
time you were there, you know,

290
00:18:48,631 --> 00:18:51,660
it was a bad scene and they were
all really fun and humorous.

291
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,760
And then you actually got to pick splurge
buddies and it pushed an alert to your

292
00:18:56,761 --> 00:19:01,080
splurge buddies. Kind of like
a, not that I know. And um,

293
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:04,860
and those people could text you and say,
what are you doing?

294
00:19:04,861 --> 00:19:07,530
Like you're saving for your kid's College,
get out of Nordstrom.

295
00:19:07,531 --> 00:19:11,640
So it was a really fun way to get people
to think about their money differently

296
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,230
without preaching to them.

297
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:17,010
And then we really went
on the offensive with PR,

298
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:22,050
but we had never really used earned
media as anything but reactive.

299
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,280
And so we went out and got very,
um,

300
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,600
I think differentiated and brave
in terms of what we doing with Pr.

301
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:34,260
One of the things that we did that was
just really interesting is we were an

302
00:19:34,261 --> 00:19:36,570
online bank and if you're an online bank,

303
00:19:36,571 --> 00:19:38,700
your phone needs to be
charged at every moment.

304
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:41,670
Because if you want to interact
with your money, you need a,

305
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:42,990
you need a phone that's working.

306
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:48,290
So we actually had drones
that were branded with the
ally logo and we passed out

307
00:19:48,691 --> 00:19:53,691
phone chargers in malls through these
drones and it was just a really cool way.

308
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:57,870
They were ally branded phone chargers
and we've got a ton of PR out of it,

309
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:02,130
a lot of earned media and it was a really
interesting and disruptive way to do

310
00:20:02,131 --> 00:20:02,970
something different.

311
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,720
Now the one common thread that I can tell
you through all of this is that every

312
00:20:08,971 --> 00:20:13,710
single point of it,
somebody told me how dumb the idea was.

313
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:18,660
Somebody told me that it was a
dangerous thing to do for our brand.

314
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,750
Somebody told me why it would fail,

315
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,540
somebody told me why we shouldn't do it.

316
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:30,530
And the one thing that we did the entire
way is we filtered out the noise and we

317
00:20:32,201 --> 00:20:36,840
put our heads down and we use the golden
gut and we believed in what we were

318
00:20:36,841 --> 00:20:39,030
doing and we pushed forward.

319
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:43,020
I can't tell you how many things like
the splurge your Lord App where somebody

320
00:20:43,021 --> 00:20:44,940
said to me,
what's the business case for this?

321
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:48,460
Let me see what the Roi is going
to be on this. What are your KPIs?

322
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:53,070
And that's kind of the world
we live in today. You know, um,

323
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,850
everything is testable and everybody
wants to know what the data says.

324
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:02,110
And while you have to use the
data to make informed decisions,

325
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,820
you can't let the data prevents you
from doing things that you know are the

326
00:21:06,821 --> 00:21:10,900
right things to do and you have to
forge forward and you have to take the

327
00:21:10,901 --> 00:21:15,580
consequences, good or bad. Not
everything that we did was awesome.

328
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,770
Not everything that we did was successful,

329
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,280
but the vast majority of
what we did was successful.

330
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:25,090
We have our highest brand awareness
that we've had in our company's history.

331
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:30,750
Our brand engagement scores went from
43% to over 90% right now our likability

332
00:21:33,701 --> 00:21:37,690
scores are all in the 90s our
business has never been better.

333
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:41,350
Our stock was at $15 a share
when we started this campaign.

334
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:44,650
It's near $30 a share a year.
And a half later.

335
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:49,270
So I encourage you guys to think
about the importance of bravery,

336
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:53,500
filter out the noise and just push
forward and do what you need to do.

337
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,100
I'm going to play the launch
spot that launched the um,

338
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,710
the new campaign and I
think when you see it,

339
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,740
I think it's a great testament of what
I'm talking about relative to kind of

340
00:22:02,741 --> 00:22:04,990
doing things different
in this banking space.

341
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,590
Remember here at ally,

342
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:10,410
nothing stops us from doing right by our
customers is with me. Hi Man. Damn man.

343
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,493
Tiny.

344
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:31,280
Wait, wait, wait. Where's Tina
doing the hand thing? Yup.

345
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:34,880
We're all in for our
customers ally with right.

346
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:40,010
Sarah was like Motley Crue.
Are you kidding me? You know,
even our board was like,

347
00:22:40,011 --> 00:22:42,320
I think the lead singer died
from a drug overdose. I'm like,

348
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:45,260
everybody dried from died from
a drug overdose that, I mean,

349
00:22:45,261 --> 00:22:50,261
who are we going to find that didn't a
really different way to come to market.

350
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,840
A really different way to
kind of reposition our brand.

351
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:57,860
Show are people doing over the
top things and just have fun.

352
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:02,870
And what ended up happening as a result
of this spot is it caught fire and

353
00:23:02,871 --> 00:23:05,900
everybody in social was talking
about doing the hand thing.

354
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:11,060
And so we stoked the fire by immediately
jumping on it and having a contest and

355
00:23:11,061 --> 00:23:14,750
telling people to send in their best
content of them doing the hand thing.

356
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:20,080
And then we surprised and delighted
people with different prizes for the best

357
00:23:20,331 --> 00:23:23,870
pictures or the best content that came in.
So again,

358
00:23:23,871 --> 00:23:25,400
just kind of doing things differently,

359
00:23:25,401 --> 00:23:27,950
being brave and getting
outside of the space.

360
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:32,450
Recently we did something around the
Superbowl that I wanted to show you guys.

361
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:36,830
Um, this was, I think another
moment of bravery, right?

362
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:41,860
Which is this idea that everybody can
buy every big market or can buy a spot on

363
00:23:42,681 --> 00:23:44,960
the super bowl if they want.
But for us,

364
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:48,480
felt like it was duplicitous to spend a
couple million dollars on a spot in the

365
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,820
Superbowl when we're out there telling
our customers to think about having a

366
00:23:52,821 --> 00:23:54,050
savings mindset.

367
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:59,500
So we wanted to take advantage of the
biggest day of consumerism by intercepting

368
00:24:00,111 --> 00:24:02,810
it and interrupting it
in a really unique way.

369
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:06,260
So I'm going to show you a
video that I think will, um,

370
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:09,410
give you a good sense of it and we'll
talk a little bit about how it did.

371
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:19,660
I Want my children to know that they
always have a place to come back to.

372
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:24,070
Something need to be done about what was
going on in our inner city when she got

373
00:24:24,071 --> 00:24:24,904
injured.

374
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:29,710
It was upsetting given back to them
with whatever I earn is one of my top

375
00:24:29,711 --> 00:24:30,544
priorities.

376
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:30,700
So again, a very different way to go
to market in a time when you know,

377
00:25:30,701 --> 00:25:34,330
all brands are spending millions of
dollars to get you to buy a bag of Doritos

378
00:25:34,331 --> 00:25:37,990
or a mountain dew by producing
giant television spots.

379
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:41,500
We did something,
I think much different than that,

380
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:45,400
and we created this virtual reality APP.
And again,

381
00:25:45,401 --> 00:25:48,160
a lot of questions around it. You
know, what if the APP doesn't work,

382
00:25:48,161 --> 00:25:51,640
what if it crashes that night?
What if other brands are mad at us?

383
00:25:51,641 --> 00:25:55,030
Because the APP only activated
during the commercial breaks.

384
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:57,280
So that was the only
time that you could play.

385
00:25:57,281 --> 00:26:00,520
And we are taking eyes away from the
investment that people had in their

386
00:26:00,521 --> 00:26:05,200
Superbowl spots. And again, yeah, there
was some risk to it. We had never done it.

387
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,550
We didn't know how the
technology would work. Um,

388
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:11,870
Mercedes had a bit of a fiasco with the
virtual reality idea during the super

389
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:15,760
bowl. And um, for us
it turned out awesome.

390
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:20,170
We had a million and a half people
that came to our micro site.

391
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,040
We were, um, number two, um,

392
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:28,780
most downloaded app that
week in, um, in your store.

393
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,800
We were number four.
Um,

394
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:35,650
on apple we had 70,000
downloads of the APP.

395
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:40,120
We had 660,000 rounds of the game played.

396
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:45,630
And what we did is we had the top 15
scores submitted and we selected the best

397
00:26:47,221 --> 00:26:51,480
stories and the high scores merged
those two together and we granted those

398
00:26:51,481 --> 00:26:56,400
people's wishes and now we're getting
the outgrowth of all of the PR that went

399
00:26:56,401 --> 00:27:00,540
along with that. And I think just
to kind of punctuate, you know,

400
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,060
the different way that we
went to market on this,

401
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:08,120
our CEO last week wrote a handwritten
note to each one of the big save winners

402
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:11,760
and congratulated every single
one of them on behalf of ally.

403
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,450
So a really cool way to again be brave,

404
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,000
disrupt and do something really different,

405
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:21,660
especially in the face of a lot of
people saying, why are you doing this?

406
00:27:21,661 --> 00:27:23,190
And I don't think it's
the right thing to do.

407
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,730
I'm not going to go through
all of this in detail,

408
00:27:26,731 --> 00:27:30,430
but I've been doing a presentation and,
and just a part of it when,

409
00:27:30,431 --> 00:27:35,100
when we are together, um, in
December. But you know, the,

410
00:27:35,101 --> 00:27:38,670
these are the kinds of things that I
think cmos have their eyes on right now.

411
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:43,800
And these are the kinds of things that
keep us up at night as we think about the

412
00:27:43,801 --> 00:27:47,690
best way to come to market and marketing
in this brave new world. You know,

413
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,230
I always say to my team,

414
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:54,060
marketing's changed more in the last
five years than it's changed in probably

415
00:27:54,061 --> 00:27:55,920
the 25 years proceeding that.

416
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,550
And we have to be on a
constant learning agenda.

417
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:04,140
I would say I probably spend two thirds
of my time doing my actual job and a

418
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:06,720
third of my time on this learning agenda.

419
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:10,620
And it's really the reign of digital
disruption and the way that people are

420
00:28:10,621 --> 00:28:14,790
interacting with brands that has changed
the way that we have to behave as

421
00:28:14,791 --> 00:28:17,730
marketers. And you look at
some of these things, right?

422
00:28:17,731 --> 00:28:19,860
Personalized Omni channel experiences.

423
00:28:19,861 --> 00:28:24,270
This idea that people want to be able to
interact with your brand regardless of

424
00:28:24,271 --> 00:28:26,520
which device they come in on.
You guys know that.

425
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,120
But for a lot of big brands
that are in the ecommerce space,

426
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,730
it's a really hard thing to get right.
You know,

427
00:28:32,731 --> 00:28:37,290
this idea of speed is of the essence
and how impatient people have become,

428
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:42,090
you know, the attention span now of
the average consumer is eight seconds.

429
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,900
I read a statistic the other day that
was staggering that because of the,

430
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:51,060
because of technology and the ability
technology has given us to multitask,

431
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:56,330
the average person packs 34 hours
of activity into a 12 hour day.

432
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:02,070
That's staggering. So as marketers,
how do we give people's thumbs to stop?

433
00:29:02,071 --> 00:29:05,730
How do we get people to look up? How do
we get people to pay attention? You know,

434
00:29:05,731 --> 00:29:09,000
keeping customer attention,
not losing people.

435
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,620
This idea of relevance versus cool.
We argue about this all the time.

436
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:17,310
What's more important to be a cool
brand or to be a relevant brand?

437
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:21,750
And our thought is relevant because the
definition of cool is changing all the

438
00:29:21,751 --> 00:29:26,160
time. You know, I think about
this idea that with all this data,

439
00:29:26,161 --> 00:29:29,970
like I talked about with all this
reliance on everybody's first response,

440
00:29:29,971 --> 00:29:34,410
always being, well that's a testable
proposition. You know, brand matters.

441
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:39,530
85% of people still say that their
purchases are driven by an emotional

442
00:29:39,901 --> 00:29:44,410
connection and that they'll spend more
money to do business with the brand that

443
00:29:44,411 --> 00:29:47,680
they have an emotional connection with.
So as a Cmo,

444
00:29:47,681 --> 00:29:50,710
continuing to drive that
is really important.

445
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,690
And then the last one on here,

446
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:56,770
which is I think a kind of a new and
emerging one that takes an incredible

447
00:29:56,771 --> 00:30:00,340
amount of bravery is this
idea of taking a stand.

448
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,120
It's really interesting in the political
climate that we're in right now,

449
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,820
people are personifying brands,
right?

450
00:30:06,821 --> 00:30:10,900
They expect us to have an opinion on
things and it doesn't matter which side of

451
00:30:10,901 --> 00:30:12,070
the fence that you're on,

452
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:16,450
but with all the issues that are emerging
with all of the movements that are

453
00:30:16,451 --> 00:30:18,280
emerging with the,

454
00:30:18,281 --> 00:30:21,430
a lot of the vitriol that's being
spewed in the political climate,

455
00:30:21,431 --> 00:30:26,431
people want to know we're brand stand
and it's not okay to be neutral anymore.

456
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:30,610
You can't take a pass,
but how do you keep your brand safe?

457
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:34,630
You know when you're wearing two
hats like me as marketing and PR,

458
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,030
how do I keep my CEO out of hot water?

459
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:41,200
When consumers want to know where
he personally stands on gun safety?

460
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,140
How do we keep our company safe?

461
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:48,850
When people want to know where we
stand on large societal issues,

462
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:53,020
it's a really interesting space that
we've never had to deal with before.

463
00:30:53,021 --> 00:30:56,020
Five years ago, people didn't care
what brands thought about stuff.

464
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,100
Now they won't do business with you if
you don't have an opinion on things.

465
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:04,630
So bravery I think is more
important than ever before.

466
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:08,650
And for me, um, and I think this
is probably a good segway into,

467
00:31:08,651 --> 00:31:12,400
into the questions. Um, bright
braveries just never been a choice.

468
00:31:12,401 --> 00:31:17,200
It's always kinda been a way of life.
I recently got remarried in December,

469
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,520
but prior to that,
and you know,

470
00:31:18,521 --> 00:31:23,380
I had been a single mom for about
15 years raising two boys and,

471
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:24,101
um,
you know,

472
00:31:24,101 --> 00:31:29,101
how do you work and raise two boys
and have the bravery when you're in an

473
00:31:29,291 --> 00:31:32,020
important job to stand up in
the middle of a meeting and say,

474
00:31:32,021 --> 00:31:35,590
I've got to go to my son's hockey
game and I'm leaving. Um, you know,

475
00:31:35,591 --> 00:31:38,440
I've always been a woman
in an industry full of men,

476
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:41,710
whether it was automotive
or financial services,

477
00:31:41,711 --> 00:31:46,300
it was always me and all the guys
sitting around the table. And, um,

478
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:46,721
you know,

479
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:49,780
it's just different for a
woman in business and we'll
probably talk a little bit

480
00:31:49,781 --> 00:31:50,950
more about that as well.

481
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:55,660
But having the bravery to kind of stay
true to who I am and stay true to what I

482
00:31:55,661 --> 00:31:56,381
believe in,

483
00:31:56,381 --> 00:32:01,381
but also being able to interact in
that setting and around those tables.

484
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:06,440
And then always having big
responsibility at very young ages. Um,

485
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:09,910
and guy and I were laughing a little bit
before we came into here if maybe a lot

486
00:32:09,911 --> 00:32:12,700
of it is just people haven't caught
up with me yet or figured it out.

487
00:32:12,701 --> 00:32:16,990
But you know, I had my
second son, I was um,

488
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:20,140
I think 35 years old.
I came back from maternity leave,

489
00:32:20,141 --> 00:32:23,080
I had two kids under two years old
and all of a sudden I was the account

490
00:32:23,081 --> 00:32:27,700
director on the Chevrolet
Account, a Campbell, he walled
the youngest person ever,

491
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:30,820
the only woman in the 99
year history of the account.

492
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:35,740
And I found myself kind of thrust into
a really interesting space at a very

493
00:32:35,741 --> 00:32:36,341
young age.

494
00:32:36,341 --> 00:32:40,490
And how do you have that credibility
and how do you maneuver through that?

495
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:43,880
And for me,
it just always return to that one thing.

496
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,480
And it was that idea of being brave and
saying what was on my mind and having a

497
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:55,511
voice and not being afraid to push on
the issues that were important to me and

498
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,680
not being afraid to say,
I kind of am what I am.

499
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,240
And if people don't like it,

500
00:33:02,241 --> 00:33:05,870
then I'm probably not right in this
culture and I'm not right in this job.

501
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,710
And knowing that you can't
operate in a world of fear,

502
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:13,280
that you have to operate
from a position of strength.

503
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,930
And I've always kind of governed myself
by the saying that good is the enemy of

504
00:33:17,931 --> 00:33:18,764
great.

505
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,130
And I guess that's kind of what I want
to leave you guys with is always pushed

506
00:33:22,131 --> 00:33:26,120
for great braveries that spine
that runs through all of it.

507
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,780
But just remember, it's okay,
you can always find another job.

508
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:34,010
You're going to be okay. But at the
end of the day when your career's over,

509
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:38,780
you want to be able to look at yourself
and have integrity and know that you did

510
00:33:38,781 --> 00:33:42,530
things the way you wanted to do things.
And you always stay true to who you were.

511
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:47,300
So hopefully you got kind of out of the
examples and the things I talked about

512
00:33:47,301 --> 00:33:48,410
why it's so important.

513
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:53,660
I think you're at a perfect company to
continue to have this bravery to lead the

514
00:33:53,661 --> 00:33:58,661
charge in the advancements of where
this crazy rain of digital disruption is

515
00:33:58,671 --> 00:34:00,620
going and to um,

516
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:05,420
kind of never forget about staying true
to what your culture means and what it

517
00:34:05,421 --> 00:34:08,180
means to you and why you're here.
So thank you guys.

518
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,330
Despite all the technical glitches we
got through it and I appreciate your

519
00:34:11,331 --> 00:34:12,350
patience.
Thank you.

520
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,353
Sure.

521
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,370
Yo,

522
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:23,140
thank you so much for joining us and
talking about what brave means to you and

523
00:34:23,141 --> 00:34:23,601
my pleasure.

524
00:34:23,601 --> 00:34:27,670
I think one of the biggest things that
as a company that we can take away is um,

525
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:30,000
the fact about the golden gut.
Um,

526
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:34,210
the Golden God haven't heard that used
in a long time know that gut feeling of

527
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,580
what's really right versus wrong rather
than always being about the data.

528
00:34:37,581 --> 00:34:40,670
And it was a big data company.
I think we get stuck with ourselves,

529
00:34:40,671 --> 00:34:42,150
with the clients.
Um,

530
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:46,820
a lot of different audiences about a hesby
day to day to data. And we never knew,

531
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:48,020
never use us.
Yeah.

532
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:53,480
Can you provide an example of when you
had to really go home or with your gut

533
00:34:53,481 --> 00:34:54,890
than what the data was telling me?
Yeah,

534
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,560
absolutely. I mean that first campaign
that I showed you guys, truck and pony,

535
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:05,380
um, you know, the, the visceral
reaction from people was, uh,

536
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:09,830
it's mean you're being mean to
the little kids. Um, you know,

537
00:35:09,831 --> 00:35:14,540
you shouldn't take on the big banks.
You're going to really piss everybody off.

538
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:17,810
Isn't there a softer
way to come into this?

539
00:35:17,811 --> 00:35:22,490
Why do you have to go out and kind of
poke the bear if you went out? And,

540
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,310
um,
it required a lot of bravery.

541
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:30,230
It required us as a marketing team to
kind of unite and come together and say,

542
00:35:30,231 --> 00:35:33,770
if you really want to make impact,
if you really want to change things,

543
00:35:33,771 --> 00:35:38,370
you've got to go this direction. And I
knew there a lot of risk in it. I mean,

544
00:35:38,371 --> 00:35:42,360
the reality was if it failed,
I'd probably get fired.

545
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:47,580
But it was okay because we just felt
like it was the right thing to do. And,

546
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:51,150
um, we pushed forward. And
honestly, you know, to this day,

547
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:54,570
it's 10 years later and people
still talk about that campaign.

548
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:58,680
It really defined us. It
put us on the map. And, um,

549
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:01,110
last year was the 10
year anniversary of it.

550
00:36:01,111 --> 00:36:04,710
And we actually brought the little
kids back now 10 years later.

551
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,460
And with the launch of the duet,
right campaign, we said, all right,

552
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:11,850
we played a mean trick on you at the
time and now we're going to do things the

553
00:36:11,851 --> 00:36:15,480
right way.
And so we gave that little girl a pony.

554
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:21,210
We gave her a real pony and we brought
the monster truck kid back. And, um,

555
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:25,590
we actually, we blindfolded him and
we had them like in a giant arena,

556
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:30,360
kind of like, you know, Ford field.
And, um, when we took the blindfold off,

557
00:36:30,361 --> 00:36:33,480
there was all these monster trucks and
we let them tear it up in a bunch of

558
00:36:33,481 --> 00:36:36,060
monster trucks for the
afternoon. So, you know,

559
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:38,400
it's just a cool way to
bring it full circle.

560
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:41,020
So with your teams though, in
that Golden God, do you have,

561
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:43,110
how do you keep them engaged on that?
Knowing that the number,

562
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:47,290
where's it going, you know, um,

563
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:51,060
one in a, you'll find this. Uh,
but we don't pretest anything.

564
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:54,750
So I don't pretest any creative.
I don't believe in it. Now,

565
00:36:54,751 --> 00:36:59,400
thankfully I have a CEO that doesn't
want to see pretesting and isn't really

566
00:36:59,401 --> 00:37:02,220
focused on it, but there's a
lot of times where he'll say,

567
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:06,090
I don't think that's a good spot
and I don't think we should do it,

568
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,910
but I trust your opinion and if
you want to go ahead and do it.

569
00:37:08,911 --> 00:37:13,620
And I think my team sees that and I
really think you have to walk the walk and

570
00:37:13,621 --> 00:37:16,530
talk the talk.
You can't talk about being brave,

571
00:37:16,531 --> 00:37:18,630
you can't talk about
doing things differently.

572
00:37:18,631 --> 00:37:22,200
You can't talk about taking risks
unless you personally take them.

573
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:27,500
And I think my team sees me
take them every single week. Um,

574
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:30,180
great example.
We're doing agency reviews right now.

575
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:33,000
We put all our business
up for review. And, um,

576
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:36,750
I was with our CEO last week and in front
of a bunch of people from my team and

577
00:37:36,751 --> 00:37:37,830
he said,
well,

578
00:37:37,831 --> 00:37:41,610
why don't I fly out and I'll meet with
some of these agencies with you and I'll

579
00:37:41,611 --> 00:37:45,510
bring Jen who's our CFO? And
I said, no. He was like, what?

580
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,310
And I mean this was in front of everybody.
I said,

581
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,220
I'm not going to these agencies
with our CEO and the CFO,

582
00:37:50,221 --> 00:37:53,250
they're never going to want to do
business with us. And he's like, okay,

583
00:37:53,251 --> 00:37:54,810
fair enough.
You know,

584
00:37:54,811 --> 00:37:58,830
you have to show your team that you're
brave enough and you've got the passion.

585
00:37:58,831 --> 00:38:00,390
And then I think people will follow.

586
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:00,821
Well,

587
00:38:00,821 --> 00:38:05,821
I think that that fits really good into
my next question about presence and your

588
00:38:06,161 --> 00:38:09,340
ability just to be so down
to earth and saw authentic.

589
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,350
It just draws people to you.
I mean,

590
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:14,710
as you move up in your career and
now are sitting in the c suite, it,

591
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:16,570
it can be intimidating for others.

592
00:38:16,571 --> 00:38:19,510
But when I met with you and presented
with you in front of a bunch of dealers,

593
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:21,003
right?

594
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:24,250
It was like talking to your best friend.

595
00:38:24,251 --> 00:38:27,930
So I just want to hear about how have
you spoke about a little bit here,

596
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:30,960
but how you maintain that
and why that is so funny.

597
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:34,640
Well, thank you. First of all,
I have, I have a lot of sayings,

598
00:38:34,641 --> 00:38:38,770
but another favorite saying of mine
has never drink your own koolaid. Um,

599
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:42,910
and I hate as I grew up in the agency
business and I think a lot of you guys

600
00:38:42,911 --> 00:38:45,250
probably have seen the same thing,
right?

601
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:49,960
As people get in bigger and bigger jobs,
they become more and more precious.

602
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:51,010
It's like,
you know,

603
00:38:51,011 --> 00:38:55,150
our old CEO didn't want any
potato chips that were brown.

604
00:38:55,151 --> 00:38:58,510
So as Admin used to like pluck out
the burned potato chips, I'm like,

605
00:38:58,511 --> 00:39:02,650
are you kidding me? If, and
I've always thought to myself,
if I ever get like that,

606
00:39:02,651 --> 00:39:06,730
somebody, please shoot me. I
never want to be that person. Um,

607
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,020
so I've all, and I also know
that a job can be over like this,

608
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,190
especially in the CSUITE. You look at
things like average tenure of a Cmo,

609
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:17,530
18 months and you know,

610
00:39:17,531 --> 00:39:21,520
you get a new CEO or you get a board
member or you do something and,

611
00:39:21,521 --> 00:39:24,790
or the KPIs are going in the
right direction and you're out.

612
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:27,210
And so my belief is,
um,

613
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:30,760
if I take myself too seriously and if I,

614
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:35,140
if I put off that I'm a Cmo,
so I'm better than everybody air.

615
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:39,310
Um, nobody wants to be around me and
who wants to be around people like that.

616
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:44,340
It isn't very fun and it's not fun for
me either because I learn from the people

617
00:39:44,711 --> 00:39:48,460
on my team every single day. And if
they're intimidated by being around me,

618
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:52,030
it's a bad place to be. So I've always
kind of straight stayed true to that.

619
00:39:52,031 --> 00:39:56,860
Never drink your own Koolaid, never let
a job or a career define you. You know,

620
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:59,560
when I'm,
when I decide to kind of hang it up,

621
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:04,090
I want to be defined by the kind of
leader I was, the kind of person I was,

622
00:40:04,091 --> 00:40:06,880
the legacy that I left on
advertising and marketing.

623
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,670
And I want people to say
she was a really cool chick.

624
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,890
I don't want them to say she was
an arrogant idiot. Thank you.

625
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:18,610
Um, do you mind speaking a little bit to
the last time that you shared? I mean,

626
00:40:18,611 --> 00:40:22,740
it's really amazing how transparent
you are about who you are as a mom.

627
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,253
Um,

628
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:30,630
how would you say you maintained that
relationship with your boys as they grew

629
00:40:31,871 --> 00:40:36,610
and, and also this role so far? Yeah. You
know, um, everybody talks about balance.

630
00:40:36,611 --> 00:40:39,430
Whoever like came up the word
with the word and balance.

631
00:40:39,431 --> 00:40:43,000
I don't care if you're a man or a woman
in business, there's no balance. It just,

632
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:46,120
it's ridiculous and
it's, um, it's, you know,

633
00:40:46,121 --> 00:40:49,420
fairy tale land to believe that
you can achieve it. And so for me,

634
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:53,530
my thought was always,
um, I'm going to be,

635
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,870
I'm going to make what I do matter.

636
00:40:55,930 --> 00:41:00,310
And I have a platform where
I can make my son's into,

637
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,840
you know, really good men and, um,

638
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:08,910
I can give them experiences that they
could never get if I didn't have this job.

639
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,310
And so a lot of what I did is,
first of all,

640
00:41:12,311 --> 00:41:16,000
I picked the things that were really
important to them and I never missed those

641
00:41:16,001 --> 00:41:20,290
things. So I think a good example is
when my son was a senior in high school,

642
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:24,910
he was on the varsity hockey team and it
was really important to him that I was

643
00:41:24,911 --> 00:41:29,770
there and I travel a ton and I made a
commitment to them at the beginning of the

644
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:31,870
season and I said,
I'm not going to miss any of your games.

645
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:36,170
And no what I had to do.
I made it to every single game.

646
00:41:36,171 --> 00:41:39,080
Now if any of you guys are hockey parents,
you know,

647
00:41:39,081 --> 00:41:43,820
you're talking to like 60 games and
I just establish that, you know,

648
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,190
with my boss. And I said, I'm
not gonna miss any of his games.

649
00:41:46,191 --> 00:41:50,090
So I'd literally be like on a three day
trip and if he had a game on Tuesday,

650
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:51,890
I leave on Tuesday afternoon,

651
00:41:51,891 --> 00:41:56,180
I'd fly to the game and I'd
fly back either that night
or early the next morning.

652
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,020
Um,

653
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:00,320
the other thing that I always did is I
brought my boys as much as I could with

654
00:42:00,321 --> 00:42:02,120
me.
So when I traveled,

655
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:05,960
I brought them with me and
they got to see me in action.

656
00:42:05,961 --> 00:42:09,620
I bring them to things like this. I still
do, I bring them to inner, you know,

657
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:13,640
interact with dealers. Um, they were
always my date for everything. You know,

658
00:42:13,641 --> 00:42:18,250
I was single, so it was my
two boys and me. Um, and they,

659
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:20,390
they learned about being in big cities.

660
00:42:20,391 --> 00:42:22,970
They learned about getting
around airports. They, you know,

661
00:42:22,971 --> 00:42:26,900
you can drop either one of them into any
situation and they're not intimidated

662
00:42:26,901 --> 00:42:30,320
by it. Um, and then the time
that I was home with them,

663
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:34,040
I just was like really present
in the moment. My phone was down.

664
00:42:34,041 --> 00:42:37,790
I wasn't on my computer and the
time that we had was for us.

665
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:41,930
And today we have the closest
relationship. Um, you know,

666
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:45,050
and I've got two step kids now and I'm
trying to do the same thing with them and

667
00:42:45,051 --> 00:42:48,290
just give them an opportunity to
kind of see the world through my Lens

668
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,433
in school.

669
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:54,750
I used to try to be at everything and
you just can't know really finding out

670
00:42:54,751 --> 00:42:59,000
what they need you. You got to give
yourself a break. Like I'll tell you,

671
00:42:59,001 --> 00:43:03,050
but you know, women
have horrible guilt. Um,

672
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,290
but I think this advice goes for men
or women. Lie Yourself off the hook.

673
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:10,400
It's okay. Like, do you think that
now that my son's 21 years old,

674
00:43:10,401 --> 00:43:13,670
he's ever going to remember that I didn't
go to one parent teacher conference.

675
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:18,140
I didn't, he doesn't talk about
that when he's around his friends,

676
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:22,310
he talks about my mom's got this awesome
job and she's a CMO and she's done this,

677
00:43:22,311 --> 00:43:22,910
this and this.

678
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:26,540
That's what he talks about and he
talks about the things that we've done

679
00:43:26,541 --> 00:43:30,830
together. He doesn't talk about those
kinds of things. So give yourself a break,

680
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:33,140
you know, be where you need to
be when you need to be there.

681
00:43:33,141 --> 00:43:37,160
But a lot of that stuff, don't worry
about it. They're never going to remember.

682
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:39,260
Of course.

683
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:44,260
One more question I'll turn
to the audience about to
try and specifically one of

684
00:43:44,961 --> 00:43:49,540
the big buildings we see your big purple.
I like to call the crown building.

685
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,520
Yeah.
We're coming down there too.

686
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:56,000
I'm excited to have you guys down there
and anything you were mentioning how

687
00:43:56,001 --> 00:43:58,930
much you love being down there even
though you drive a very long way to,

688
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:03,980
I do give us some things to look forward
to or things that you really love. Yeah.

689
00:44:03,981 --> 00:44:08,540
So we were one of the first big companies
to move back or to move everybody

690
00:44:08,541 --> 00:44:11,870
downtown. We had half of our employees
were there and then we had some people in

691
00:44:11,871 --> 00:44:16,400
Southfield and Auburn hills and kind of
spread out all over the place. And um,

692
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,181
you know,

693
00:44:17,181 --> 00:44:20,540
we had announced that we are going to
actually be moving out of the city and

694
00:44:20,541 --> 00:44:22,430
Mayor Duggan came to us and said,

695
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:27,110
give me two weeks to put a plan together
to keep you guys in the city of Detroit.

696
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:31,010
And he called Dan Gilbert and said,
buy a building.

697
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:35,240
We need to keep them down here.
And he bought that building and um,

698
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,870
we rebranded it to ally center
and we did something really cool.

699
00:44:39,871 --> 00:44:43,500
I actually got to do the design working
with the architects and the design firm

700
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:48,240
and we gutted 15 floors and we designed
every floor like a different Detroit

701
00:44:48,241 --> 00:44:51,660
neighborhood. So everyone is, um,

702
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:56,130
an homage to a different Detroit
neighborhood and it's a really cool way we

703
00:44:56,131 --> 00:44:59,400
sourced all the materials from those
neighborhoods. So for instance,

704
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:01,770
Corktown all the,
um,

705
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:05,970
all the wood on the floor is from trees
that had fallen in Corktown and we've

706
00:45:05,971 --> 00:45:09,570
got the stories of those neighborhoods
on each one of the floors.

707
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:12,930
So we've got big murals with the story
of each one of those neighborhoods.

708
00:45:12,931 --> 00:45:17,700
And it's a great way to kind of teach the
next generation about the city because,

709
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:21,420
you know, I grew up going downtown
all the time, but my kids didn't.

710
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:23,490
And I'm sure a lot of the
people in this room did it.

711
00:45:23,491 --> 00:45:26,160
And it's like getting people to
fall in love with the city again.

712
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:30,990
It's awesome being down there. Um, we
pride ourselves on being one of Detroit's,

713
00:45:30,991 --> 00:45:32,280
you know,
favorite children,

714
00:45:32,281 --> 00:45:36,810
we believe really strongly in supporting
everything that's important to the city.

715
00:45:36,811 --> 00:45:41,640
So whether it's the 4th of July, the
fireworks and sponsoring those, um,

716
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:43,410
you know,
sponsoring things with the,

717
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,730
with the red wings and the
Tigers and the lions, um,

718
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,170
being really active in charities
and giving back to the city,

719
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:56,220
um, having people volunteer and
we've just really immersed ourselves.

720
00:45:56,221 --> 00:46:00,360
So I would tell you guys, get out,
have fun, especially in the summer.

721
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:04,920
There's so many awesome restaurants
down there now. Um, stay late,

722
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:06,740
have a good time while
you're down there and,

723
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:10,920
and throw yourself into everything that's
going on in the vibe down there is so

724
00:46:10,921 --> 00:46:14,700
creative and so awesome right
now that it's just really,

725
00:46:14,701 --> 00:46:17,970
really inspiring to be downtown.
I wouldn't want to be anyplace else.

726
00:46:17,971 --> 00:46:19,710
And where your Detroit pride,

727
00:46:19,711 --> 00:46:22,170
I actually got the old English
d tattooed on my back, so

728
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:24,870
I had to represent,

729
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:29,840
now we're going to turn to the
audience for any additional questions.

730
00:46:29,841 --> 00:46:33,200
Does anybody have any questions to ask?
Andrea

731
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:35,903
chicken.

732
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:40,720
Hi Andrea. A lot of us actually got our
start on the agency side as well too.

733
00:46:40,721 --> 00:46:45,280
So when you mentioned that you were in
that big role at 35 at Campbell Ewald

734
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:48,130
it's not that I was ever at a big role.
I was no one,

735
00:46:48,131 --> 00:46:51,280
but I did also start on
the creative agency side.

736
00:46:51,281 --> 00:46:55,570
So I'm wondering what do you think
now as a CMO who's being brave,

737
00:46:55,571 --> 00:46:58,870
taking a lot of really cool
disruptive marketing challenges,

738
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:02,980
what do you think from that time on the
agency side prepped you best and makes

739
00:47:02,981 --> 00:47:05,560
you competitive in a great weapon?

740
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:09,430
No, it's, that's a great question. Um, and
I'm sure you were somebody at the agency,

741
00:47:09,431 --> 00:47:13,570
so don't sell yourself short.
Um, so first and foremost,

742
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:17,890
I think that what I learned on the
agency side is just about creativity.

743
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:21,760
And I know how to get great
creativity out of an agency.

744
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:25,660
That's a really important attribute,
right? Because you guys know,

745
00:47:25,661 --> 00:47:30,040
especially in the creative world,
clients saw off all sharp edges.

746
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:33,130
Like you get a really cool idea and by
the time it's done going through the

747
00:47:33,131 --> 00:47:37,630
spanking machine, it's sucks when it
comes out the other end. And so I'm,

748
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:42,280
I'm very, very protective
of the creative process. Um,

749
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:46,900
you know, I, I really, well I try and
kind of bring our business partners along.

750
00:47:46,901 --> 00:47:51,901
I try and really shield the creative
process and I think that agencies feed off

751
00:47:52,061 --> 00:47:54,760
of that protection and that agency.
Um,

752
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:57,900
I think the second thing is the golden
gut that I talked about. Like I,

753
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:03,060
I know when I see potential in an idea
and you guys remember from your agency

754
00:48:03,431 --> 00:48:07,120
days and ideas, not always perfect
the first time, but you know,

755
00:48:07,121 --> 00:48:11,410
when there's something there and a lot
of clients that just kind of grew up on

756
00:48:11,411 --> 00:48:12,760
the client's side the whole time,

757
00:48:12,761 --> 00:48:16,540
they either test it and it dies
or they can't see the potential.

758
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:21,520
They don't know how to keep moving it
along and making it better and making it

759
00:48:21,521 --> 00:48:25,960
into something more powerful than it was
when it started. And then I think third,

760
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:26,530
um,

761
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:31,530
just the ability to stand up and
present and have a presence and you

762
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:35,830
underestimate how important that
is in business. But you know,

763
00:48:35,831 --> 00:48:38,910
when you're standing in
front of a board and, um,

764
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:43,540
you need to be able to deliver really
powerfully a point of view around

765
00:48:43,541 --> 00:48:47,950
something that's potentially
controversial or you know,

766
00:48:47,951 --> 00:48:51,400
when your boss says you're
going to present it investor
day and you're in a room

767
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:52,680
and you're,
you know,

768
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:56,380
and you're in front of 500 people that
are thinking about investing in your

769
00:48:56,381 --> 00:49:01,180
company and what you say could affect
your stock price and the way that your

770
00:49:01,181 --> 00:49:04,630
company goes forward. Like if you,
and everything in between, right.

771
00:49:04,631 --> 00:49:08,350
If you don't have that ability to have
that presence and those presentation

772
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:11,110
skills, um, it's a really tough road.

773
00:49:11,111 --> 00:49:13,540
So those things were
really important to me.

774
00:49:13,541 --> 00:49:17,650
I really took those from my
agency time. Yeah, go for it.

775
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:20,020
Nothing's off bowels.
I'll tell you anything you want to know.

776
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:26,490
Check. Um, so Andrea, uh,
Mike Orlando again. Um,

777
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:29,580
thank you again for coming in.
I feel like allies,

778
00:49:29,581 --> 00:49:33,480
one of the undervalued stories of Detroit.
Um,

779
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:35,700
can you talk a little bit about culture,

780
00:49:35,701 --> 00:49:40,080
what you guys are doing within the walls
of ally, what your CEO's, you know,

781
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:43,660
yeah. The core objectives
are. Yeah, no, that's a great
question. And I agree. I mean,

782
00:49:43,661 --> 00:49:47,500
part of our, it's funny, you'd think
that 10 years has been a long time,

783
00:49:47,501 --> 00:49:51,310
but it's not for a brand and it's not
for a brand that doesn't spend the brand

784
00:49:51,311 --> 00:49:52,990
spend in the category.

785
00:49:52,991 --> 00:49:57,991
So just our ability to grow sheer
awareness and get the story out there,

786
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,760
um, has been tough. And, and honestly,

787
00:50:00,761 --> 00:50:03,610
a big part of it was because
we are so reactive and PR.

788
00:50:03,611 --> 00:50:07,180
And when I took on PR
responsibility last year,

789
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:12,010
we said we're going to really go out and
start to be really proactive and that's

790
00:50:12,011 --> 00:50:16,000
helped us a lot. The company
is an amazing company. Um,

791
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:19,900
our CEO is 44 years old. He is, um,

792
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:24,730
one of the five youngest
CEOs in the fortune 500. Um,

793
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:28,130
he believes very strongly culture when

794
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:31,610
he goes out and talks to
investors and they say, what,

795
00:50:31,850 --> 00:50:35,630
what is going to separate you from all
of the other players in the financial

796
00:50:35,631 --> 00:50:39,050
services category?
His first answer is always culture.

797
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:44,360
And a lot of investors are like, wow, no
one ever talks about culture. And, um,

798
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:47,750
he believes very strongly in a
number of things he believes first.

799
00:50:47,751 --> 00:50:50,300
I think in foremost in
diversity and inclusion.

800
00:50:50,301 --> 00:50:54,140
And I know that's a really popular thing
to say, but it's a harder thing to do.

801
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:59,200
If you look at our c suite and
our executive council out of, um,

802
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:03,440
probably 18 people on our
executive council, um,

803
00:51:03,441 --> 00:51:06,650
we have at least eight
women in c suite positions.

804
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:10,730
Our chief human resources officer or chief
financial officer or the president of

805
00:51:10,731 --> 00:51:15,230
our bank, myself. Um, you know, the
list kind of goes on and on. In fact,

806
00:51:15,231 --> 00:51:20,231
our CFO is the only female CFO
in the entire banking industry,

807
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:25,250
which is staggering. Um, he's
established employee resource groups.

808
00:51:25,251 --> 00:51:29,310
So we have 15 different employee
resource groups and, um,

809
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:33,770
you can join the employee resource group
that you either identify with or the

810
00:51:33,771 --> 00:51:36,320
employee resource group that
you want to learn about.

811
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:39,200
And that's been an awesome way,
you know,

812
00:51:39,201 --> 00:51:43,340
investing budget and time
for people to do that. Um,

813
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:48,370
he believes very strongly in being
purpose driven and we give everybody time.

814
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:53,360
Um, you know, we call it PTO time to, um,

815
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:57,380
our VTO time where they can volunteer
and do things that are important to them

816
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:00,410
and being a part of the community
and doing things really different.

817
00:52:00,411 --> 00:52:04,490
So this month happens to be financial
literacy month and we did something really

818
00:52:04,491 --> 00:52:07,670
cool for that where, um,
instead of just writing a check,

819
00:52:07,671 --> 00:52:12,470
we actually wrote a children's book
called planet z and the money tree and it

820
00:52:12,471 --> 00:52:16,520
teaches kids about money and the
fact that it doesn't grow on trees.

821
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:21,880
And we have all of our employees going
into schools and doing readings of planet

822
00:52:22,291 --> 00:52:25,690
z in the money tree. And
if you go on, you know,

823
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:27,500
if you go on and of our social pages,

824
00:52:27,501 --> 00:52:31,710
you'll be able to either download a copy
and then we're donating hardcopies to,

825
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:33,630
to schools as well.
Um,

826
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:37,370
and then the other big thing that
I would say with him is he's not a

827
00:52:37,371 --> 00:52:39,620
micromanager and nobody had ally is,

828
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:43,250
and we let people kind of
sore their wings and go,

829
00:52:43,251 --> 00:52:46,790
we have a culture of innovation.
We're digital financial services.

830
00:52:46,791 --> 00:52:50,660
So we have to stay on the leading edge.
Maybe not always the bleeding edge,

831
00:52:50,661 --> 00:52:51,560
but on the leading edge.

832
00:52:51,561 --> 00:52:56,561
And you have to create a
culture of innovation and
you have to a invest in that.

833
00:52:56,901 --> 00:53:00,170
Even though everybody's always
talking about how do I cut expenses.

834
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:04,250
So he's very good about
invest, invest, invest and to,

835
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,800
he's not afraid to let us fail.

836
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:11,600
So you can take reasonable
risks and if you fail,

837
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:15,530
it's a good thing to learn from. And
there's no punishment on the other end.

838
00:53:15,531 --> 00:53:19,670
You don't lose your job, you know, you
don't get a slap on the risks, the risks,

839
00:53:19,671 --> 00:53:23,660
you know, even little things like putting
that Motley Crue music on the spot.

840
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:27,690
Like I said, our board was really about
it and he was like, if you want to do it,

841
00:53:27,691 --> 00:53:31,830
you do it. You're the CMO, good or bad,
you know, it's on you and I support you.

842
00:53:31,831 --> 00:53:34,710
So I think those are the things
that are happening in ally.

843
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:39,660
It's an awesome company. Um, we're going
through these agency pitches right now.

844
00:53:39,661 --> 00:53:40,890
As I mentioned,
for me,

845
00:53:40,891 --> 00:53:44,940
I think the next big thing I want to do
is just create this awakening around how

846
00:53:44,941 --> 00:53:48,960
great the company is,
how differentiated our product is,

847
00:53:48,961 --> 00:53:51,330
and just get people to pay
attention to their money again,

848
00:53:51,331 --> 00:53:52,680
and that's what we're really trying to do.

849
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:54,433
Yup.

850
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:04,560
All right. Thank you again. Thank
you guys. Thanks for having me.

851
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:08,200
[inaudible].
