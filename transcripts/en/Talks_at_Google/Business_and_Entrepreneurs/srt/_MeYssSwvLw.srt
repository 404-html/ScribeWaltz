Thank you very much.

19
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:24,280
Thank you for joining us.
Oh, it's a pleasure. Uh,

20
00:01:24,281 --> 00:01:26,650
so I'd like to begin by asking you,
so,

21
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:31,060
so you developed the theory of
integrative thinking 15 years ago. Yeah.

22
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:34,840
How did the idea come to you and,
and what is it in its simplest?

23
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,350
Sure. Well, in its simplest form,

24
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,330
it is the notion that when you're faced
with an either or choice or it seems

25
00:01:42,331 --> 00:01:47,250
like you can only do one or the other
thing. What I found is that highly,

26
00:01:47,251 --> 00:01:52,251
highly successful leaders take that as
a sign that they shouldn't choose or

27
00:01:52,711 --> 00:01:56,430
compromise. It's their job. They're
leaderly job to come up with a,

28
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,480
with a better answer. And the way
I got interested in it was Detroit.

29
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,860
I was really interested,
you mentioned monitor company and,

30
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,150
and a bunch of business
school buddies. Uh, myself,

31
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,760
a couple of professors thought the world
needed another consulting firm and we,

32
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:17,720
we sort of called ourselves internally
were sort of young punks consulting, uh,

33
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,570
because all the Mckinsey and Bain and
BCG people were much older than we were.

34
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:26,810
And I was exploring the question of why
on earth did clients hire us and for

35
00:02:27,091 --> 00:02:31,830
what particular kinds of things? And,
and what, what I found was that they,

36
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,750
they hired us for that
sort of problem was when,

37
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,990
when they were facing a kind of a
big either or choice, it wasn't like,

38
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:44,100
were we need to improve our marketing
or we needed it sort of, boy,

39
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:48,420
we can do this. So we're going to do
that. Uh, and, and we're a bit flummoxed.

40
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,040
And,
uh,

41
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:55,041
and so I just started observing how they
thought and how the most successful of

42
00:02:56,131 --> 00:03:00,880
them a thought and came to this conclusion
that the only thing I could figure

43
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:04,180
out that was consistent across the
really highly successful leaders that I

44
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:07,900
interviewed was this one thing.
And,

45
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:12,850
and the tricky thing was I first
looked at what they did and what I,

46
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:17,260
what I found is that there was
no commonality in what they did.

47
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:22,570
I, um, and it was because they had
a completely different context.

48
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:25,600
So I, and so I interviewed all of these
highly successful leaders, you know,

49
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:30,130
Jack Welsh and Michael Dale and Bob
Young and, you know, Izzy sharp funder,

50
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:33,100
four seasons, et cetera. Um, and,

51
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,850
and I couldn't figure out something
that they did that was similar,

52
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,730
but I realized it was so context specific.

53
00:03:39,731 --> 00:03:44,230
And Jack Welsh was an interesting one
for me because early on and Jack Welch at

54
00:03:44,231 --> 00:03:47,350
the time is as CEO of Ge,

55
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,850
he said to all businesses,
unless you're really big,

56
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,310
unless you're number one or two
market sharing in a divest you,

57
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,310
they all thought he was fooling cause
it never happened in the history of Ge.

58
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:02,130
And he had divested about a third
of the portfolio. Uh, and uh,

59
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,770
but then later on in
his long tenure as CEO,

60
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,790
he basically told his
businesses the opposite,

61
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,160
which is be small.
He said,

62
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:16,720
do not come to your strategy review with
me defining yourself as any bigger than

63
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:20,140
15% of your market.
Uh,

64
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:24,700
and you could ask why.
So those are like the opposite.

65
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:29,200
Define yourself as small or,
or a a defined yourself as big.

66
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:33,500
And the reason of course
is early on he was at,

67
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:36,760
had the problem of having a really messy
portfolio that he needed to clean up

68
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:40,510
later on. He was worried about growth
and was tired of the jet aircraft.

69
00:04:40,511 --> 00:04:43,420
People coming in and saying, Jack,
we've got 70% market share already.

70
00:04:43,421 --> 00:04:45,700
There's no growth there that yeah,

71
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:48,280
that might be of a building
and selling engines.

72
00:04:48,281 --> 00:04:52,870
But if you add in leasing
sales, uh, repair,

73
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,380
trading, all of that, you've
got five percentage share,

74
00:04:56,381 --> 00:04:59,940
shut up and get back to
work. Um, so be so, because,

75
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:04,000
because there wasn't a pattern of
doing something similar, I started,

76
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,590
I started asking him is there a
thinking pattern? And I, and I,

77
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:08,830
and I started asking them,

78
00:05:08,831 --> 00:05:12,070
what are the five hardest decisions
you've ever made in your life?

79
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:16,420
And came to the conclusion, uh, that what,

80
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:19,630
what made them successful
was not accepting tradeoffs.

81
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,670
Just refusing a and saying there's
gotta be a better way. And then,

82
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:28,160
so 10 years ago you wrote the opposable
mind, what was the idea of that dog?

83
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,440
If it was,

84
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,790
it was to describe that
phenomenon and give examples of,

85
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:38,320
of highly successful leaders who faced
what appeared to everybody else to be an

86
00:05:38,321 --> 00:05:42,820
either or choice.
And they did something different.

87
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:48,220
So when related to your, you know,
if the world you're in, Bob Young,

88
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,790
cofounder of red hat
dominant Linux software,

89
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:56,410
he faced the challenge of are we, you
know, uh, there's two things I could do.

90
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,940
Free software, which is
what he started in, in, in,

91
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:01,850
in red hat or proprietary software.

92
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,430
And he liked how much money proprietary
software companies like Microsoft, uh,

93
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,360
made, but he hated the fact
they wouldn't give them this, a,

94
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:14,060
the customer that source code.
So it wasn't modifiable.

95
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,480
He loved the free software part of it,

96
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:20,720
which is you give them the source code
and they can do whatever they want with

97
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:24,650
it. Felt that was, that was kind of
better for the better for the world,

98
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,420
a better for his customers,

99
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:29,630
but he needed the fact that you couldn't
make a buck in it because anybody could

100
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:33,770
put together Linux, uh, compilations.
And at that point, the way you, you may,

101
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,480
you the business,
uh,

102
00:06:35,481 --> 00:06:39,020
in 1995 when he was making
this decision was to settle,

103
00:06:39,021 --> 00:06:43,430
shrink wrap disks for 15
bucks by mail order. Joe,

104
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:48,200
what do you do? Free or proprietary?
That was the, the, the choice he faced.

105
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:53,030
Everybody else shows free or proprietary.
Uh,

106
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,540
he said, I don't like
that. And came to the,

107
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:01,100
came to the conclusion that
out of the proprietary model,

108
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:03,980
what he loved was service contracts.
You made a lot of,

109
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,840
you could make a lot of money on,

110
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:10,320
on servicing the corporations that used
your software with updates and aversion

111
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,190
control and all of, all of that. Um,

112
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:16,670
and what he liked about free was,
uh,

113
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:21,350
was giving them the source code that the
clients, the customers could do with it.

114
00:07:21,351 --> 00:07:24,500
What they, what they wished didn't
actually like selling short,

115
00:07:24,501 --> 00:07:28,690
grab this for 15 bucks a mail order.
And so as he thought about it,

116
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:31,400
he realized, actually, uh,

117
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:35,990
there could be a way of getting the
thing I care most about, about free,

118
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,820
and the thing I care most about from
proprietary, which was his innovation,

119
00:07:40,821 --> 00:07:42,500
which just say, here's, here's the deal.

120
00:07:42,501 --> 00:07:45,230
I'm going to make this the first
software that's downloadable,

121
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:49,580
free off the Internet. We
will get dominant market
share, will be the only Linux,

122
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:54,470
a company that big corporation to
will trust and will make a will.

123
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,860
Uh, create a big service
of business doing that.

124
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,860
That would be the classic
kind of integrative thinking,

125
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:05,930
a kind of choice that I talked
about in the 2007 bucks.

126
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,700
So you,

127
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:11,240
you've expounded the theory of integrative
thinking and the opposable mind,

128
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,670
what new value does
creating great choices,

129
00:08:14,671 --> 00:08:18,740
spraying it explains more how so what we,

130
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,970
what we got that mean the 2007 one ended
up being a bestseller and it was all

131
00:08:22,971 --> 00:08:25,250
great and everybody
said, wow, that's great.

132
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,250
That gives me sort of hope
that I can do something better.

133
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:32,450
But people struggled with, uh, well,
exactly. Roger, how do you do that?

134
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:37,550
And we spent 10 years after
figuring out what they did,

135
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,630
uh, experimenting with how you
could teach somebody how to do it.

136
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,770
How exactly did they do it and how could
somebody who might not naturally be

137
00:08:45,771 --> 00:08:49,520
great at this or have experienced in
this could do it so that creating great

138
00:08:49,521 --> 00:08:51,380
choices is the,

139
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:55,220
is the distillation of 10 years
worth of experience in the how.

140
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,910
So it's more like an a manual that
says if you want to do this thing,

141
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:01,950
if you buy the premise of,
of uh,

142
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,450
the opposable mind and you want to
do this thing, here's how you do it.

143
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:11,370
Yeah. It's very, very much a how to
think, a methodology of thinking.

144
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,080
Why do you think that's necessary?

145
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,640
Well,
you know it,

146
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:21,200
I probably got smacked on the head
enough times by my most beloved academic

147
00:09:21,201 --> 00:09:22,550
mentor.
His name is Chris Argyris.

148
00:09:22,551 --> 00:09:25,550
These are the passed away a couple
of years ago after our long,

149
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,320
almost 90 year life.

150
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,660
But he would say to me when I worked
with him was Roger Action and upon which

151
00:09:32,661 --> 00:09:37,220
you cannot take knowledge upon which
you cannot take action is barely worth

152
00:09:37,221 --> 00:09:39,650
having it all.
And what he said,

153
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:44,740
his criticism of much managerial advice
is the moral equivalent to grow taller,

154
00:09:45,201 --> 00:09:49,480
be smarter, whatever. And everybody's
like, I must tall as I'm going to be.

155
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,000
I haven't trying as hard as I
can, you know, think harder. Well,

156
00:09:53,001 --> 00:09:55,880
I'm thinking as hard as I can,
all of that is not helpful.

157
00:09:56,030 --> 00:10:01,030
So I have a sort of a high bar myself
or unless somebody can walk away and do

158
00:10:02,421 --> 00:10:04,250
the thing I've told them to do,

159
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,940
I might as well not have told them in
the first place. It's just an irritation.

160
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:11,330
They all, they'll get their
hopes up and be unable to do it.

161
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:16,450
And so that was the integration when
people said, I love this Roger. Aye. I, I,

162
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:20,840
I love the examples you
give and I love that goal.

163
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,700
You know,
how do I do it?

164
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:27,880
So if we look at companies today,
yeah. The way they make decisions,

165
00:10:27,881 --> 00:10:32,170
there are certain best practices.
What in your opinion is, is lacking?

166
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:33,400
Yeah,

167
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:38,400
I think most of the best practices in
decision making are closer to worst

168
00:10:38,601 --> 00:10:43,400
practices and best practices to be
honest. I mean, uh, they're, they're,

169
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,570
uh, I think people, uh,
in making decisions, uh,

170
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,470
converge too quickly on a,
a solution that seems fine,

171
00:10:51,471 --> 00:10:55,670
rather than choosing a
stepping back and saying,

172
00:10:55,671 --> 00:10:59,570
I'm going to try for
something better. Um, I think,

173
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,530
I think a lot of decision making is there,

174
00:11:03,531 --> 00:11:07,250
I say here and Google plex to analytical.

175
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:12,650
Um, it, uh, uh, this great decisions,

176
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:17,380
uh, our creative, uh, by
their nature. Uh, and,

177
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:21,110
and so I, I often see people saying,
well, we've got a decision to make.

178
00:11:21,111 --> 00:11:25,460
Let's crunch all the data in
order to make, make that decision.

179
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,430
And what's the problem
with crunching data?

180
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:33,570
What from what era is 100%
of all data from what era?

181
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,080
Yeah,
the past.

182
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:41,530
So can you crunch data to figure out
something that has never happened before?

183
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:50,930
Can you, you know, like, no. In fact,

184
00:11:50,931 --> 00:11:52,850
if you crunch data from the past,

185
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:58,270
you will convince yourself the future
will be an extrapolation of the past.

186
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:04,370
And I'm like not the clever guy who
thought this up, right? Aristotle is the,

187
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:09,250
is the man, uh, in the fourth century
BC who explained this to the world.

188
00:12:09,251 --> 00:12:11,780
And the world is largely
ignored Aristotle, right?

189
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:16,840
So he explained that there are
two parts of the world, uh,

190
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:20,530
in one part of the world.
Things cannot be other than they are.

191
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,880
That's what he said. Fine.
So if I fall off this chair,

192
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:29,920
I won't fall up. I'll fall down. And
even if I do that a million times,

193
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,060
I'll fall down.

194
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:34,890
That's part of the world where things
cannot be other than they are a,

195
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,630
and he said in that part of the world,
he invented the scientific method.

196
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:41,320
It was formalized 2000 years later in the
scientific revolution by Descartes and

197
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:46,060
Bacon and Newton and Galileo.
But he laid out,

198
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:50,210
here's how you use science to
demonstrate. He said, the Pr,

199
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,560
the unqualified purpose of science is to
demonstrate that things cannot be other

200
00:12:53,561 --> 00:12:57,610
than they are. So he laid
that out. Uh, and he said,

201
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,910
if you're dealing with the part of the
world where things can not be as in,

202
00:13:00,911 --> 00:13:05,620
they are, be scientific and analyze
the hell out of it. That's rigor.

203
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:08,740
But he said there's another part of the
world where things can be other than

204
00:13:08,741 --> 00:13:12,490
they are.
Like consumers have never ever,

205
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:15,130
ever used one of the devices.

206
00:13:15,131 --> 00:13:19,810
It's in everybody's hands as of 1998.
Right?

207
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,300
And now they can't live without them.
Well,

208
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:25,690
that's the part of the world where
things can be other than they are.

209
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:26,681
And you know what?

210
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:30,040
The world's first scientist and the most
important scientists in the history of

211
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:33,430
the planet said in that part of the world,

212
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,410
do not use science.

213
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,720
Do not.
Instead in that part of the world,

214
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:46,460
rigor means imagining possibilities
and choosing the one for which the most

215
00:13:46,461 --> 00:13:50,970
compelling argument can be made.
Uh,

216
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:51,843
the world.

217
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,340
Listen to Aristotle about science and
then ignored his warning about the

218
00:13:57,341 --> 00:13:59,470
limitations of science.

219
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:04,210
So the biggest complaint,
I mean there are exceptions.

220
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,960
Google, apple, Facebook, Amazon.

221
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,440
But the biggest complaint
of fortune 500 CEOs now is,

222
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:15,160
is I can't find enough organic growth.

223
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,260
That's my big problem.

224
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:22,800
And I'm more worried about two kids in
a garage who I don't even know exist yet

225
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,580
than I am about my biggest
competitor across across the street.

226
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:33,610
That in my view is not uncorrelated
with over the last 50 years,

227
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:38,380
management becoming science
and, and, and analysis obsessed.

228
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:42,860
Because if you're a science
obsessed and you're,

229
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,300
and you're crunching data about the past,

230
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:47,210
eight will tell you a new thing
can't happen and won't happen.

231
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:52,160
The data shows that it won't then two
kids in the garage and make it happen.

232
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:57,500
Or Two kids in a PhD program, uh,
at Stanford and make it happen.

233
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,280
Uh,
and,

234
00:14:59,281 --> 00:15:02,150
and then all the companies that we're
sure it couldn't happen because science

235
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:06,290
told them it couldn't, uh, are wondering
what the hell just happened here,

236
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,210
right. Like all advertisers other than
Google or Facebook or wondering like, uh,

237
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,890
you know, what, you know
what, uh, what happened here?

238
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,700
There are analysis showed that what's
happening here could not happen.

239
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:22,400
So that's a bit of a rant, but
that's, that's, that's my number one,

240
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:26,120
the number one problem with a management
decision making in the modern world.

241
00:15:26,121 --> 00:15:29,120
It under values,
imagination,

242
00:15:29,121 --> 00:15:31,610
and then wonders why it
doesn't come up with new ideas.

243
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,710
Yeah. I just, I want to pursue
that tangent nationally.

244
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:39,440
It sounds like you have a very polymathic
way of thinking about business.

245
00:15:39,441 --> 00:15:40,610
Where does that stem from?

246
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:42,101
I guess,
I mean,

247
00:15:42,101 --> 00:15:45,270
I've always been accused of being as
sort of a business philosopher. Uh,

248
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,620
so maybe it's just,
I've always,

249
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:50,920
I guess I've always
wanted to understand why,

250
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:56,370
why business works and how to understand
aspects about business that aren't

251
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:02,350
readily understood or
are confusing to people.

252
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:07,520
Um, so for instance, this
one came out of me, me,

253
00:16:07,521 --> 00:16:10,550
he's trying to answer the question of
why all these CEOs who I work with,

254
00:16:10,551 --> 00:16:15,520
because I worked with a whole bunch of
big, big companies, CEOs saying, Roger,

255
00:16:15,521 --> 00:16:19,570
we're spending more on
innovation and getting less.

256
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:23,080
I can't figure this out.
What's happening?

257
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:27,640
And then these people who
don't have anywhere close
to the resources we have are

258
00:16:27,641 --> 00:16:32,260
producing more innovation than, than
we are. So, so, so I try to figure out,

259
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:36,190
figure out mysteries, um, and,

260
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,180
and give people better ways of
thinking about the mysteries of,

261
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,870
of business life. And,
and uh, it turns out,

262
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:47,680
I think that that to
figure those things out,

263
00:16:47,681 --> 00:16:52,681
you typically have to step outside the
strictures and frameworks that you've

264
00:16:53,171 --> 00:16:54,004
been taught.

265
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:59,610
So if I tried to solve the problems of
the business people who I deal with by

266
00:17:01,691 --> 00:17:06,040
applying what I learned at a
business school, and I went
to a perfectly good one.

267
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:09,320
I mean they're all, there are,
lots of them are good ones,

268
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:12,340
but I went to Harvard business school
and if I just applied what I learned at

269
00:17:12,341 --> 00:17:14,830
Harvard business school to solve
these problems, I couldn't solve them.

270
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,930
Lots of them.
Most of them.

271
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:22,180
It's because what it seems to require is
stepping outside the strictures because

272
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:25,860
often the strictures and question,
you know, created the problem in the,

273
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:29,170
in the first place. So I guess,
I mean it is a good question.

274
00:17:29,171 --> 00:17:32,500
Nobody's asked me that before.
Uh, but that would be my best,

275
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,080
my best guess at an answer.

276
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:38,260
Thank you. Um, so when you're developing
the methodology for the book, yes.

277
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,940
Did you come across any surprises or
were there any sort of Aha moments? Yes.

278
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,600
The biggest surprise to knock
me over with a feather surprise

279
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:51,000
was that what figured out,

280
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,100
uh,
by,

281
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:58,310
by studying all of these integrative
solutions is that none of them came from

282
00:17:59,461 --> 00:18:03,930
the most commonly used approach
to creating innovation.

283
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:09,210
What kind of piece of paper do you
start out with to get a real innovation?

284
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,650
What kind of a blank one, right?
Get out a blank sheet of paper,

285
00:18:13,651 --> 00:18:17,760
throw out everything that you know and
that'll give you the best chance of an

286
00:18:17,761 --> 00:18:21,600
innovation. It's a cool theory,
like it makes a whole lot of sense.

287
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:24,420
You're unconstrained and did the
DA, all that, all that stuff.

288
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:29,840
It turns out that in no case of any highly
successful leader who came up with an

289
00:18:30,601 --> 00:18:34,890
integrative decision that I studied,
it doesn't mean they don't exist,

290
00:18:34,891 --> 00:18:39,840
but I couldn't find one
actually came about there.

291
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,920
They're innovative breakthrough
idea from a blank sheet of paper.

292
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,140
They came to it by mining opposing models,

293
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:54,890
so Bob young would say I needed to
have a true understanding of the free

294
00:18:55,411 --> 00:19:00,411
software model as it existed in 1995 and
a real understanding of the proprietary

295
00:19:01,411 --> 00:19:06,411
model and why it was successful to come
up with a solution and that solution.

296
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,880
As I say it, my definition of integrative
thinking is when faced with a,

297
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:16,620
with a opposing models that you've come
up with a creative resolution of the

298
00:19:16,621 --> 00:19:19,530
tension in the form of a model
that contains elements of each,

299
00:19:19,531 --> 00:19:20,730
but it's superior to both.

300
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:24,690
And so that you can knock me over with
a feather because up til up until the

301
00:19:24,691 --> 00:19:28,080
time when that became evident to me,
you know, I just said, hmm, interesting.

302
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:33,120
I was in the camp. Have to free
yourself up and be more innovative.

303
00:19:33,121 --> 00:19:36,780
You get take up blank sheet of paper now.

304
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:41,610
Now instead what I say is
you have to fall in love.

305
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:46,670
Absolutely fall in love with
the two models sequentially
fallen in love with the

306
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:50,490
first one. And the cool thing about the
first, you know, falling in love is right.

307
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,040
What happens when you fall
in love with somebody,

308
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,720
you accentuate all their good things and
focus entirely on their good things and

309
00:20:02,071 --> 00:20:05,940
act as if nothing else in the world exist.
Do we do we all recognize this?

310
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,880
We've all fallen in
love. Okay, so it's cool.

311
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,480
And so I say do that because what
matters is mining each model for the good

312
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:19,770
things. Forget about the bad things.
Who Cares? Who Cares about that?

313
00:20:19,771 --> 00:20:20,960
You don't want any of those many ways.

314
00:20:20,961 --> 00:20:25,050
So don't even think about them finding
good things and then forget about it and

315
00:20:25,051 --> 00:20:28,020
fall in love again with
the other model and,

316
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,620
and figure out what are the good things
there and then figure out a time or way

317
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:35,580
to put them together.
And in doing this and doing this,

318
00:20:35,581 --> 00:20:40,440
what we learned just through trial and
error is to push the model's farther

319
00:20:40,441 --> 00:20:44,670
apart to the absolute
extreme. Uh, you know,

320
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:48,970
so if you're gonna, if you're gonna say,
oh, we have a problem with is should we,

321
00:20:48,971 --> 00:20:52,600
uh, you know, leadership development in
our company, should we centralize it all?

322
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:56,710
And you're right in, Eh, you know, here
or decentralize it around the world,

323
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,470
people would be inclined to say,
well,

324
00:20:59,471 --> 00:21:03,600
a more centralized or less
centralized model is, let us
look at those two. No, no,

325
00:21:03,601 --> 00:21:05,740
no, no, no, no. Model one,

326
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:09,910
every last single thing and
decision is made centrally.

327
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:14,530
There is no central training function.
It doesn't exist.

328
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:18,100
It is completely dispersed.
If you do that,

329
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:21,010
you have a better chance as it turns
out of coming up with an integrative

330
00:21:21,011 --> 00:21:24,970
solution, then more sensible.
Yeah. Kind of sensible models. Uh,

331
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,170
somewhere in between.

332
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:30,280
The reason is there's not as many raw
materials in those compromise he type

333
00:21:30,281 --> 00:21:34,050
models because the enemy of integrative
thinking is compromised. Hate it.

334
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,010
Worst thing, nobody's happy. Everybody's
got to like medium sad, right?

335
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:42,220
Nobody's like Super Mad and
nobody's super happy. I hate that.

336
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:45,550
I want delirious this and that.
Turns out for that.

337
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:50,080
That was another thing that was a
surprising fine. The other thing is,

338
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:55,240
and the thing is kids
can do this. Uh, we, uh,

339
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,290
we had a great,

340
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:01,880
a Rotman Grad who was the director,

341
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:06,610
Dan sort of academic vice principal of
a girls' school, a girls' high school.

342
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,720
And uh, and she said, you know, we,

343
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:13,240
we want to try this integrative
thinking thing with our great 10 girls.

344
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:17,290
Those a Ib school, International
Baccalaureate School.
So in grade 11 and 12,

345
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:20,920
you do the two years of the ID and
so in great to Ng said be good.

346
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,160
It would be good saying, uh, to do, uh,

347
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:28,270
for grade a grade 10 girls in the spring
of grade tend to be ready for granted.

348
00:22:28,271 --> 00:22:31,810
11 and 12. I said, okay, you
know, I'm game for anything.

349
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:35,150
Taught them integrative thinking.
Cocurricular was, you know,

350
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,830
outside school for noncredit 22 girls,
they're all keen on it.

351
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:44,040
Gave them a project similar to the
project we gave the Mbas and their answers

352
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:50,050
were every bit as good as the Mba answers,
which,

353
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,340
which gifts you, I mean, like that sort
of, whoa, wait a minute. So the Mbas have,

354
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:58,540
have at least six more years of
formal education read 11 grade, 12,

355
00:22:58,690 --> 00:22:59,770
four years of Undergrad.

356
00:22:59,771 --> 00:23:03,520
And some of them all already have masters
or PhDs before showing up at minimum

357
00:23:03,521 --> 00:23:06,010
of six and they have four and a
half years of work experience.

358
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:08,860
So 10 and a half years,
a decade of life experience.

359
00:23:08,861 --> 00:23:11,950
And they're no better thing.
So we must,

360
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:17,100
we must damage them in ways we don't
understand so that they have to recover to

361
00:23:17,261 --> 00:23:20,600
get back to the same
level. But that got me, uh,

362
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,420
which I think is absolutely the case.

363
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:26,700
And so we now have a huge program
that's the apple of my eye.

364
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:31,100
I think this is the most important thing
we do for k through 12 and we teach

365
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,920
integrative thinking
now to five year olds.

366
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:37,900
We teach the content of that book to
kindergarten kids and they're great.

367
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:42,790
So that was, that was fun. Who Does it?
Who does not get, but there they're great.

368
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,060
They're as good as a graduate students.
Okay.

369
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:49,730
So yeah, the, it seems
like when we were, when we,

370
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,710
when we seem to think that
there's only two options,

371
00:23:51,711 --> 00:23:54,740
that's something that's almost
conditioned. Yeah. Other than,

372
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:55,931
yeah,
we are conditioned.

373
00:23:55,931 --> 00:24:00,490
We are conditioned to say a tough guy
or a tough gal when faced with a big

374
00:24:00,491 --> 00:24:03,690
choice like that knuckles
down and it makes it,

375
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,490
the kids haven't been trained that yet.
They sort of say,

376
00:24:06,491 --> 00:24:10,480
I don't like that one or that one much.
You know? And, and if we say, well here,

377
00:24:10,481 --> 00:24:12,550
it would be a methodology for getting
to a better one. They're like,

378
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:17,890
give it to me. Let's go, let's, let's do
it. Or as Mbas to a much greater extent.

379
00:24:17,891 --> 00:24:22,540
Or like, you know, in
theory that might be nice,

380
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:25,090
but it's about making tradeoffs.

381
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:28,330
That's job tough job buck stops here.

382
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:32,040
Interesting thing is all these
super highly successful, uh,

383
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:37,150
leaders said,
basically said integrative thinking is,

384
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,530
is, or, you know,

385
00:24:38,531 --> 00:24:43,030
a trade off is my signal to not choose a,

386
00:24:43,031 --> 00:24:46,280
and Alfred Sloan, the legendary
guy who built, uh, uh,

387
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:48,900
General Motors in the 2030s or forties,

388
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:51,760
that by far the biggest company in the
world and the most successful automotive

389
00:24:51,761 --> 00:24:54,940
company in the world, it's great quote
where he, where he's quoted as saying,

390
00:24:54,941 --> 00:24:58,660
and this is by Peter Drucker who studied,
who studied him is after a meeting.

391
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:02,560
It was gentlemen, and because they
were all gentlemen then gentlemen,

392
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:06,250
I see that we've come to agreement
on this important decision. Uh,

393
00:25:06,251 --> 00:25:11,090
I suggest that we terminate the meeting,
uh, now and come back only when we've, uh,

394
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:14,230
had time to develop some
constructive debate.

395
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:20,280
So it made Alfred Sloan junior very
worried and nervous when all of his

396
00:25:21,611 --> 00:25:25,800
executives quickly came to a solution,
uh,

397
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:30,310
because he just needs it.
We probably haven't come up
with the best one. Uh, yeah.

398
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:35,050
And, and, uh, and that, that
is easier for kids to absorb.

399
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,810
And for,
for adults stoves or,

400
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:42,360
yeah. So the message is consensus
is, is actually a bad thing. And you,

401
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:46,340
you make an interesting point in the
book where you say that a different idea,

402
00:25:46,341 --> 00:25:50,510
even if it's wrong, still has value.
Yes. Could you maybe talk a little bit?

403
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:54,310
Yeah. I mean, what, what I,
what I try to do now in my,

404
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:57,110
my life is even when I think
I've got the right answer,

405
00:25:57,111 --> 00:26:01,430
I say I got to try and come up with
a different one, even if it's bad,

406
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:05,850
even if at the turns out to be a bad
idea to see if there's something I'm

407
00:26:05,851 --> 00:26:06,684
missing.

408
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:11,750
There's a component that I could add to
my model that is sort of inconsistent

409
00:26:11,751 --> 00:26:16,070
with my model. Like, I wouldn't think of
it on my, on my own. But if I had this,

410
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:19,910
this other model,
I might think about it like this.

411
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,230
What are the examples we use in the book?

412
00:26:21,231 --> 00:26:25,190
It's the Toronto International
Film Festival, which is
now the most important, uh,

413
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:29,060
largest dollar volume, more deals done
film festival than any in the world.

414
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:33,230
Here's handling the director
of it. Loved, loved, love.

415
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:36,650
The fact that it was a very
community oriented film festival.

416
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:39,860
Anybody in Toronto can go
and see the movies, you know,
during the film festival,

417
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:43,680
just to all the movie theaters, uh,
open themselves up to show these shows.

418
00:26:43,681 --> 00:26:46,170
You can buy tickets.
It's very inclusive.

419
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:51,330
There's no jury that decides which is
the best. Uh, the best film he loved,

420
00:26:51,331 --> 00:26:53,570
loved, loved, all of that. Uh,

421
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:56,970
but the only thing he didn't like is
that they almost went broke every year.

422
00:26:56,971 --> 00:27:00,000
It was hard to be
sustainable with this model.

423
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:03,030
And so he looked at con,

424
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:07,350
which is the absolute extreme other model.
Totally exclusive.

425
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,140
You can't go to con unless you were
invited. And that's because you're a star.

426
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:14,620
A director of, uh, producer, uh, or,

427
00:27:14,621 --> 00:27:18,900
or the like the show 15 or 20 movies,
and there's a jury that decides who's,

428
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:23,760
which is the best films, which,
which Pearce says, I hate that.

429
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:28,050
It's so elitist. It stands for
exactly everything that I stand,

430
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:30,840
a stand against, uh, et cetera.

431
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:36,140
But he would be the first to say it's
the only one I studied con that I figured

432
00:27:36,481 --> 00:27:38,760
out the secret to making tiff,

433
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,880
which when he took over was the
third best film festival in Canada.

434
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:45,990
Montreal was better. Bamf was, oh, it was
better. I was in the, on the mountain,

435
00:27:45,991 --> 00:27:50,520
so it was irrelevant little
film festival. Um, he said,

436
00:27:50,521 --> 00:27:55,521
the one thing I love is the sponsorship
revenue that they get from the global

437
00:27:56,041 --> 00:28:00,010
buzz that comes from
having a prize and heavy.

438
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:03,840
Who's going to win the Palme d'or that
brings everybody all the stars there,

439
00:28:03,841 --> 00:28:06,900
which brings the media there and they
get all this buzz and then everybody,

440
00:28:06,901 --> 00:28:09,810
you know, Evian or crystal
wants to have a bottle of their,

441
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:13,860
of their product in front of every starlet
when they're interviewed and it goes,

442
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:16,410
goes global.
So he couldn't,

443
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:21,480
what he would never have been able
to figure out. The clever solution,

444
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:26,370
clever solution for him was,
uh,

445
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:30,900
what's interesting about the Toronto
International Film Festival to the

446
00:28:30,901 --> 00:28:34,890
industry.
People have to buy their tickets.

447
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,920
And it's Toronto, which
is whether you, you know,

448
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:42,510
it or not as the most ethnically,

449
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,960
racially diverse city in the face of
the planet, of any consequential size.

450
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:50,610
50% of people in the Greater Toronto
area have a foreign passport, America,

451
00:28:50,611 --> 00:28:54,060
the highest city in America, and all
of America's, uh, in New York at 20.

452
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:58,320
So it's sort of two and a half times more,
uh, you know, kind of diverse than that.

453
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:03,180
So what is cool about the Toronto
International Film Festival audience?

454
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:07,290
What is it
leading global indicator?

455
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:10,920
Because the people have to buy their
tickets and they're only going to buy

456
00:29:10,921 --> 00:29:13,980
tickets to the movies that they're,
that they're interested in seeing.

457
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:17,610
And they are like a little
bit of a, uh, a, uh,

458
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:22,770
a amalgam of the world.
And so what's the integrative solution?

459
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:27,360
People's choice award.
How's it about this?

460
00:29:27,361 --> 00:29:32,361
We give everybody a ballot who buys a
ticket and goes to a movie and they will

461
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:38,910
decide, not some jury of
elites. What's the best film?

462
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,070
And then that film

463
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:48,250
is probably going to do well.
And so over the last 10 years,

464
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:54,270
the average global box offer office
of the palm d'or winner and con is 16

465
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,793
million.

466
00:29:57,070 --> 00:30:02,070
The average global box
office of a people's choice
award winner at tiff is 200

467
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:06,880
million. And those, those last,

468
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,100
those last 10 years,
the,

469
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:14,430
the tiff films and had 69 Oscar
nominations winning 23 of them con 11

470
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:20,380
nominations, winning one total
Oscar, and in the last decade.

471
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:23,590
So what he came up with
was something that made,

472
00:30:23,591 --> 00:30:26,880
made it so that Toronto is
the buzz of producing a,

473
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:29,270
a place and all the
sponsors want to be there.

474
00:30:29,271 --> 00:30:34,210
And so it's a wash and money
success by being even more so,

475
00:30:34,211 --> 00:30:37,330
it's not a compromise,
it's not a compromise.

476
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,740
He made it even more inclusive. Not only
do you get to go to any movie you want,

477
00:30:41,741 --> 00:30:46,570
whatever you with your vote help
to be the global arbiter of,

478
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:49,390
of a, of tastes. And whoever wins.

479
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:53,980
Now that the TIF award in September is
considered the Oscar, a front runner,

480
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:56,590
uh, in, uh, in the spring.

481
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:02,850
But he couldn't have come to that had he
not looked at the extreme model that he

482
00:31:04,811 --> 00:31:08,200
did not want any part of,
not quite any part of,

483
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:10,670
he wanted one little part of uh,

484
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:14,350
but he didn't know what little part
until he fell in love with that and said,

485
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:19,480
how does that work? So I'd say that
to any, anybody here in the room,

486
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:22,420
if there's that model that you just said,
a visceral level,

487
00:31:22,421 --> 00:31:24,580
say I hate that model.

488
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,000
That's the opposite of what I believe in.

489
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:33,040
Take 15 minutes,
20 minutes,

490
00:31:33,041 --> 00:31:38,041
a half an hour to say how does it work
as it did it produce the outcome it does.

491
00:31:38,291 --> 00:31:40,990
What are the little causal relationships
that produce that, that outcome?

492
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:44,860
Is there anything I can steal from that
model? So I may still hate the model.

493
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,410
Here's still really doesn't
like can't con at all.

494
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:52,870
But boy is he grateful to [inaudible]
for having given them an insight that

495
00:31:52,871 --> 00:31:57,550
enabled him to turn TIF from
nothing too incredibly important.

496
00:31:57,670 --> 00:32:01,240
So I'd like to go back to the methodology.
Yes. Could you walk us through that?

497
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,860
Yeah. So the, the, uh, the
methodology is to, is to,

498
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:09,820
is to first
take them off,

499
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,810
take the opposing models and
push them to extreme. Uh,

500
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:18,840
then it's to analyze
how those models work.

501
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:24,640
And again, this is from the mouths
of Babes. What, what, uh, what, uh,

502
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:28,960
the way we do it is, is layout how
it works. So the film festival,

503
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,620
how does the film festival work for
the various actors that community,

504
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:36,460
the industry, the festival itself,
and figure out how it works,

505
00:32:36,461 --> 00:32:39,740
what ways does it produce
the benefits that it does?

506
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:42,560
And out of the mouths of Babes,
one of the kids we were,

507
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:45,560
we were working with said, well,
this isn't a pro con chart.

508
00:32:45,561 --> 00:32:49,430
This is a pro pro chart. Huh?
And so now it's forever the,

509
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:51,890
the pro pro charts. Great.
Appropriate surcharge.

510
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:57,130
And then ask the question and we lay
out three integrative methodologies,

511
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,440
uh, to, to find an integrative solution.

512
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:05,450
One we call the the hidden gem,
right? Which is the Bob Young one.

513
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:07,580
I just want one thing out of this
one in one thing. Out of this one,

514
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:10,010
I'll throw away everything else. And, uh,

515
00:33:10,011 --> 00:33:13,640
and that's what'll that
totally get me a solution,

516
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:16,850
what we call that double down,
which is what pierce did.

517
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:22,030
How can you take one model and push down
harder on it to get the one benefit you

518
00:33:22,131 --> 00:33:26,030
want from the other model.
So you keep that whole model but,

519
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,250
but go take it to more of an extreme.

520
00:33:28,251 --> 00:33:32,810
So he made it more inclusive in a way
that got them the benefit of the other.

521
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:37,850
And then the third is it something we
call a decomposition, uh, which is which,

522
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:41,840
which is if you want to use, uh, ag
Lafley kind of creating with colleagues,

523
00:33:41,841 --> 00:33:45,200
creating connect and
develop at p and g you say,

524
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:48,380
and he was faced with a do either may,
uh,

525
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,950
spend less on innovation because we're
not profitable enough spending like we

526
00:33:51,951 --> 00:33:55,850
are on innovation. But uh, but then
that'll make us less innovative.

527
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:59,210
Do we spend more on innovation and
just say it'll come, it'll be fine.

528
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,540
That's an either or.
And he says,

529
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:06,770
it feels like an either or when you
think that it's about innovation.

530
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,470
And he decomposed it and
said, no, no, no, no, no.

531
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:14,500
It's about invention and commercialization
and invention turns out to have very

532
00:34:16,701 --> 00:34:17,840
little scale benefit.

533
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:24,890
Being bigger doesn't make you more
inventive, per dollar spent. In fact,

534
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:28,970
there's more and more data to
suggest that it makes you less.

535
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,150
So something for Google to think about it.
Um,

536
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:37,220
but commercialization is heavily scale
sensitive. If you're proctor and gamble,

537
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:40,580
you can get a hundred percent retail
distribution of something almost

538
00:34:40,581 --> 00:34:44,440
immediately, uh, and you know how to
brand it. And you can market it a,

539
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:48,620
and you get the best advertising deal
deals in industry cause he spent $10

540
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,310
billion in advertising.

541
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:53,600
So what he said is if I decompose
the model into two pieces,

542
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:56,060
not innovation but,
and commercialization,

543
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,930
I can apply one model to invention
and one model to commercialization.

544
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,480
And the intervention model is I'm going
to connect and develop. I'm going to,

545
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:07,280
I'm going to tap in to the whole world
of little inventors and be the best place

546
00:35:07,281 --> 00:35:08,360
for them to sell their,

547
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:11,690
their invention or license their
invention that will double the pipeline.

548
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:14,540
So we'll have twice as much stuff going
through our commercialization pipeline

549
00:35:14,541 --> 00:35:18,690
and will, will dramatically
improve our, our, uh,

550
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:22,700
our innovation. So that's the
third, the decomposition. So we say,

551
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:27,530
try each of these vectors,
try and find a hidden gem,

552
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:31,790
try and find a double down,
try and find a way to do a decomposition.

553
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,800
And then the fourth step,
that's the third step.

554
00:35:33,801 --> 00:35:37,560
And the fourth step is to prototype your
idea that we really believe in sort of

555
00:35:37,561 --> 00:35:37,910
the,

556
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:42,060
the design thinking oriented
rapid prototyping because
you're going to be trying

557
00:35:42,061 --> 00:35:43,730
something new.
Right?

558
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:48,390
And the tricky thing about new things
when you have to use imagination and all

559
00:35:48,391 --> 00:35:51,030
you have is a compelling
argument is they can be wrong.

560
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,170
And so it's better to prototype them and
also that way you can improve them and

561
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,840
make them better.
So that those would be the four steps.

562
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,020
Take the models to the extreme,
figure out,

563
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,570
do the pro approach to figure
out how each of them work,

564
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:10,840
explored the three pathways to
integration, prototype your best, uh,

565
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:14,850
best solution and go and my experiences,

566
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:19,710
you can always come up with a
better answer and either or,

567
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:23,070
or just a plain vanilla,
the guy hated compromise.

568
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:29,210
So you consult many fortune 100 companies
and probably many other companies.

569
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:33,620
Uh, how is this methodology received
when you, when you approach them with it?

570
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:37,440
You know, it's, it's received
pretty well. I mean, several of our,

571
00:36:37,441 --> 00:36:41,250
of of my big clients like Dow Jones,
30 size clients are,

572
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:45,870
are training people up on, on this
and saying, this is how we've got to,

573
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,410
this is how we've got to come up with,
you know, can have better answers.

574
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,420
And to a certain extent, this is how
we've got to deal with bigness. I mean,

575
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:59,421
there's a challenge to being big and
still being creative and you guys would

576
00:36:59,881 --> 00:37:04,110
know it here. I mean,
um, you know, it, it,

577
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:05,873
it's,

578
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:11,070
you have to I think go to more extreme
lengths to continue a culture of

579
00:37:11,071 --> 00:37:13,020
creativity as you get bigger.

580
00:37:13,021 --> 00:37:16,110
And so a lot of these big companies are
trying to figure out how can we make

581
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:21,000
people on a daily basis be
more kind of innovative, more,

582
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:24,540
more creative in their work and
not just hive it off and say,

583
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:27,420
you guys are going to just run the machine
and these few people over there are

584
00:37:27,421 --> 00:37:28,140
going to be creative.

585
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:32,940
Let's have everybody be creative
and you're in sales, right?

586
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:37,890
You know,
sales is a daily integrative challenge,

587
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,010
right? You would like to sell them
the most standardized thing for the,

588
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:45,960
for the highest margin than they want
the most customized thing for the lowest

589
00:37:45,961 --> 00:37:49,260
margin. Right? It's pretty much like,

590
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:53,130
I wanted it to be perfect for me and I
don't want to pay much for it. Right.

591
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:58,200
So you've got an integrative
challenge every day and the, you know,

592
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:02,660
mediocre salesman. I would, I
think either are insistent, no,

593
00:38:02,661 --> 00:38:03,900
it's going to be my way or the highway.

594
00:38:03,901 --> 00:38:08,160
And so a bunch of a bunch of customers
say, you know, I'll pick highway,

595
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:11,040
uh,
and then you sell some,

596
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:15,690
or you compromise somewhere on the line
in between those two things you do.

597
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,230
And the great salespeople
are the ones who say,

598
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:22,410
here's the way to get what you need
and to get what we need integrative,

599
00:38:22,411 --> 00:38:26,520
different, different way. So
I'd rather have, if I'm a CEO,

600
00:38:26,521 --> 00:38:31,521
I'd rather have my
salesforce be creative and,

601
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,620
and bring creativity to their,

602
00:38:34,621 --> 00:38:38,830
to their every day and to say there'll
be bog standard and they'll just follow

603
00:38:38,831 --> 00:38:42,400
us a formula while I'll have this small
other group over there doing all the

604
00:38:42,401 --> 00:38:46,330
innovation. I'd rather have
everybody be innovating every day.

605
00:38:46,331 --> 00:38:50,750
And this is a methodology for
everybody innovating every day.

606
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,200
So it seems to me that,
uh,

607
00:38:55,380 --> 00:39:00,110
this exercise is rather a rather rigorous,
uh,

608
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:05,160
activity, sort of mental
exertion. So how, uh,

609
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:09,000
how frequently do you use it?
How frequently are you to use it?

610
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:13,110
And is it something that sort of
becomes more second nature over time?

611
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:16,900
It does. It does become second nature.
There's no, no question. It does.

612
00:39:16,901 --> 00:39:20,100
But what I say when I say is, is, uh, um,

613
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:25,050
if you don't have a
hard choice, don't, uh,

614
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:29,050
youth as the youth as if
this, if like, you know,

615
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,850
nature would you feel some pain?
Nature's telling you stop.

616
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:38,500
Right. Don't keep doing
that. So do something else.

617
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:42,520
Like take your finger off
the hot hot stove. Um,

618
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:47,050
I would say the same thing here
when you feel the pain of Ah, ah,

619
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:50,800
ah, I don't know. I don't know which
to do because I don't like either.

620
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:55,360
I would love to see, and everybody's had
a little red flag go up and you say, ah,

621
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:00,720
this the time to stop and think a little
bit differently about think exactly the

622
00:40:02,321 --> 00:40:06,940
way I thought that has gotten me to this
point. Having of having that conflict.

623
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,540
Otherwise just don't just do
you go about your daily life,

624
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:15,070
but I love this little red flag. Oh,
that's a trade off that I don't like.

625
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:21,080
Could I do better? Can I do a
lot better? What would meet up,

626
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:25,270
pay off to do a lot better and then
take the inspiration, uh, to do it.

627
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:30,130
Um, and what about
situations where you have to

628
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:33,170
under pressure,
like very quickly make a great choice?

629
00:40:33,171 --> 00:40:36,200
Can you apply any of the
theories in this book? Tuition?

630
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:40,700
Yeah, I think so. And we have a great
case in the first book where it's a,

631
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,440
it's a multibillionaire who had
between close of market on day x.

632
00:40:45,441 --> 00:40:49,850
It was like a Tuesday and open
a marketing on day on Wednesday,

633
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:54,470
uh, to make a decision that it would have
either made them probably a popper or

634
00:40:54,471 --> 00:40:58,700
turned out to make him a billionaire.
So I dunno,

635
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:03,800
that sounds like a decent
amount of pressure, right?
Um, and not much time, right.

636
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:08,540
It's between five and nine.
Uh, and he's got to make it,

637
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:13,490
and I think the reason he's a billionaire
is he didn't compromise or didn't

638
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,380
choose either or he came up with,

639
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:20,420
with a different answer than anything
that had sort of presented himself.

640
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:25,320
Or people had said, Gee, Michael, you
gotta you got to decide, uh, kind of now,

641
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:29,540
now, now, now before the market opens,
we have to have a decision for sure.

642
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,210
Or it'll be,
it will be completely too late.

643
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:36,950
So I never believe in thinking that,

644
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,970
um,
that you should use time as an excuse.

645
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,290
I think you should just
be realistic. Michael, uh,

646
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:49,390
needed to have a decision by 9:00
AM on Wednesday morning and he used,

647
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,320
I don't think he slept much that
night. Right? So he said, well,

648
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:58,520
these are 12 and 14 hours or, or
less. I bet I better, I better, uh,

649
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,250
a better use them. Well, 16 hours,

650
00:42:01,251 --> 00:42:05,410
I guess I better use them well and uh,
and used them so,

651
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,340
so there,

652
00:42:07,341 --> 00:42:12,341
there's eight people I think in the world
and the business world let themselves

653
00:42:13,461 --> 00:42:17,210
off the hook way too way too many times.
Oh,

654
00:42:17,211 --> 00:42:20,660
management would never allow that.
My boss would be so mad. You know,

655
00:42:20,661 --> 00:42:24,400
I don't have enough time. We don't
have the resources lab lab of lads,

656
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:29,150
just like one list of long, long list
of accepted the managerial excuses.

657
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:34,130
And I just, I don't accept any of them.
Never have any and kind of never will.

658
00:42:34,131 --> 00:42:38,990
And I have it in my own life. I, you
know, I eat the dog food. I've, my,

659
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:42,830
you know, my career is
a, is, is a series of,

660
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:47,240
of making integrated choices rather
than accepting the choices that I'm

661
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,320
presented.
Okay.

662
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:52,500
So you've had a really interesting
career that's spanned several,

663
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,580
several industries and areas,
I guess, um, private sector,

664
00:42:56,581 --> 00:42:59,580
academia and now consulting.
Uh,

665
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:04,230
I wanted to zero in on the moments
when you decided to switch tracks.

666
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:08,580
Was that something that came to you
instinctively or was it more of a rational

667
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:09,443
choice?

668
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:14,600
Oh, it's, uh, depends what you mean
by rationality. I guess the way I,

669
00:43:14,601 --> 00:43:19,470
the way I made my first
big switch, which was a,

670
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:24,590
a decision to switch countries
and take a 94% pay cut,

671
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:29,840
uh, was, uh, was when the
president of University of Toronto,

672
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:32,930
who was on the board of a
company I was consulting to, uh,

673
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:37,790
decided that I would make a good dean
of his business school and proceeded,

674
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:42,800
he's very persuasive guy, rob
Prichard. Uh, and, and uh,

675
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:43,650
you know,

676
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:48,650
he persuaded me now he wasn't dealing
with a sort of a completely blank slate on

677
00:43:48,861 --> 00:43:52,880
that. I, I had always felt that
if you do well in business,

678
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:56,540
you should turn yourself, turn your
mind to public service at some point.

679
00:43:57,350 --> 00:44:02,220
Public service writ large, not elected
politician. I mean public service and,

680
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,130
and, uh, University of Toronto,

681
00:44:04,131 --> 00:44:08,720
like all Canadian universities as a
public university like Berkeley. Um,

682
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:13,700
and, uh, so I, so I, I thought
of that as public service. I was,

683
00:44:13,701 --> 00:44:15,980
had been living in the United
States for a quite a long time.

684
00:44:15,981 --> 00:44:19,940
I'm a Canadian as you can
tell about all my weird words.

685
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,080
And so it was going to be public service
back in my whole home country, uh,

686
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:28,340
because I believe that Canada needed
one great business school and it's zero

687
00:44:28,341 --> 00:44:33,330
great global business schools at
the time. I felt it needed one. And,

688
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:34,763
and,
uh,

689
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:38,100
I guess I managed to convince myself
or rob convince me that maybe we could,

690
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:43,350
we could, uh, do that.
And sure enough, we did a,

691
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:46,390
and you know, when I finished
that 15 or 15 years later, I,

692
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:50,730
I realized I missed,
I did some consulting all along the way,

693
00:44:50,731 --> 00:44:53,250
but not much that I missed it.
I love,

694
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:57,720
I love advising CEOs on strategy.
And so I just said,

695
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,890
I'm done with that. I'm going
to go down to halftime. Uh,

696
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,100
I'm going to run a research center,

697
00:45:02,101 --> 00:45:04,410
the Martin Prosperity Institute
that you talked about before,

698
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:07,810
or I'm trying to work on this tiny
little problem of how to fix a,

699
00:45:07,811 --> 00:45:12,330
the future of democratic capitalism, which
is kind of fun. Uh, and then consulting,

700
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:16,320
I'm more, and so there is
what I'm interested in and
worried about the future of

701
00:45:16,321 --> 00:45:19,950
democratic capitalism don't
like the way it's headed. Um,

702
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,720
and so let's see if we can fix that.
And, and uh, doing the thing I love,

703
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:28,290
which is helping CEOs
have better strategies.

704
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:33,150
So I've always believed the
guy, I was crazy. Folks who,

705
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:37,290
who built monitor company believed that
if you make better strategy choices,

706
00:45:37,291 --> 00:45:40,650
you use the world's raw materials,
labor and capital better,

707
00:45:40,651 --> 00:45:42,600
and you make the world a better place.
And I still,

708
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:45,870
I still believe that if you
make bad strategy choices,

709
00:45:45,871 --> 00:45:50,550
you just waste raw materials, you waste
labor and you waste a capitol and that's,

710
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:54,540
that's bad. That's not, you
know, not good for the world.

711
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:57,660
So I'm sort of pursuing
pursuing two loves now,

712
00:45:57,661 --> 00:46:01,470
which is sort of public policy
about something I worry about and,

713
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:05,670
and engaging in activity that I find
it rewarding and I think useful for the

714
00:46:05,671 --> 00:46:06,504
world.

715
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:09,810
Okay. So last question and then we're
going to open it up to the audience. Yeah.

716
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:13,260
Um, what's your, what's your Daily
News Diet and if you, if you,

717
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:14,990
I'm curious if you,

718
00:46:14,991 --> 00:46:19,991
you allocate any time for people like
Aristotle air or day card and your habits.

719
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:27,150
I think I have very bad habits.

720
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:33,200
I don't read much at all and I don't
spend much time listening to the news.

721
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:39,930
So, because like I, I, I think

722
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:42,630
so what I do is I,

723
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:47,720
I immerse myself in a world I care about
the world of business and I try and

724
00:46:49,081 --> 00:46:52,320
solve problems for people in business.
Uh,

725
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:57,440
and that gives me all sorts of raw
materials to write stuff that I think is

726
00:46:57,490 --> 00:47:01,800
generalized, generalizable, Lee,
useful. Cause people say, how do you,

727
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:04,290
how do you rate so much Roger? You
know, even when Lou, you're dean,

728
00:47:04,291 --> 00:47:08,430
you wrote all these books, I've written
11 books, you've written 25 HBR articles,

729
00:47:08,431 --> 00:47:10,890
you've written hundreds and hundreds
of other other owning. How do you,

730
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:14,120
where do you get your research ideas?
And for starters,

731
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:17,730
I don't think of myself as doing research.
I think of myself as doing,

732
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:18,631
I like to do stuff,

733
00:47:18,631 --> 00:47:22,800
I fix stuff and then I try to figure
out what I've learned from fixing that

734
00:47:22,801 --> 00:47:27,330
stuff. And then when
I, when I come up with,

735
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:33,170
come up with a problem in my mind then
and only then do I read stuff that,

736
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,400
that I've been told by somebody or I've
come across that I think might be useful.

737
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:41,860
So I'm like,
I'm reading voraciously,

738
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:46,450
everything in complexity theory
right now because I think,

739
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:51,130
I think we've a problem in the economy
of thinking that we're going to produce a

740
00:47:51,131 --> 00:47:54,950
kind of normal outcomes and
everything is going parade.

741
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:58,000
What's changed the economy
to make things go parado.

742
00:47:58,150 --> 00:48:02,020
So I've got to read all the
complexity theory stuff about that,

743
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:04,630
but I don't read
complexity theory and say,

744
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:07,510
how can I apply the complexity theory?
I say,

745
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:12,040
how has anybody thought about
it from a different field,

746
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:18,880
stuff that might apply to
this field, uh, right here.

747
00:48:18,881 --> 00:48:23,080
And then I, then I dive and then I'm
veracious than I have the excuse to read.

748
00:48:23,081 --> 00:48:27,400
And I don't mind reading for some reason.
I don't love reading.

749
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:31,870
I love writing. I did love,
love, love, love writing. Uh,

750
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:36,100
and so that gets me inspired to read.
And I think that's a very,

751
00:48:36,101 --> 00:48:40,720
it's like seems bad. It seems bad
behavior to me that I don't read.

752
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:44,950
Read more.
Great.

753
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:49,950
Well I think we'll take some audience
questions. I'll repeat the question.

754
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,700
So do you think machines will be able
to think integratively in the future and

755
00:48:54,701 --> 00:48:55,534
are they already doing it?

756
00:48:56,740 --> 00:49:00,460
I doubt they're doing it and
it's part because it kind of,

757
00:49:00,461 --> 00:49:04,540
humans haven't kind of organized
the thinking enough on this.

758
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:09,100
So I mean the, the, the way I think about
it, and I wrote a book in 2009 on this,

759
00:49:09,101 --> 00:49:13,990
if this, if you're interested, called the
design of businesses is, um, you know,

760
00:49:13,991 --> 00:49:18,880
kind of all knowledge on the planet
goes through through three major stages.

761
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:23,710
Everything we know now about the
world was once a mystery, you know,

762
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:26,110
why do things fall when
we let go with them?

763
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:30,790
At one point it was because of a love
for mother earth or animal spirits or

764
00:49:30,791 --> 00:49:35,500
whatever. It was a mystery,
right? And then, and then we,
when some of these things,

765
00:49:35,501 --> 00:49:38,440
we think about enough that
we reduce it to a heuristic.

766
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:42,100
So an apple falls in the head
of a smart guy and he says, ah,

767
00:49:42,101 --> 00:49:46,300
there's a universal force I'm going to
call gravity that pushes everything down.

768
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:50,140
Then if we study at uh,
hard enough, long enough,

769
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,480
some of those things get
reduced to an algorithm.

770
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:56,830
If you drop an item anywhere
in the world when America,

771
00:49:56,831 --> 00:50:00,670
it accelerates at 9.8 meters per second
squared because America is exceptional.

772
00:50:00,671 --> 00:50:04,130
That's 32 feet per second
squared here. Um, and,

773
00:50:04,131 --> 00:50:07,630
and so it's an algorithm and once you've
got something to an algorithm, you can,

774
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:08,800
you can,
in the modern era,

775
00:50:08,801 --> 00:50:11,470
this is what's different about the
modern near than any year before is once

776
00:50:11,471 --> 00:50:13,180
you've got something, you,
an algorithm, you can,

777
00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:16,090
you can code it and shove it through a,

778
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:20,680
a digital computer and
do it perfectly fast,

779
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:25,300
et cetera. So, so for, for, for, for me,

780
00:50:25,301 --> 00:50:30,020
the enabler for machines to
do things is pushing things.

781
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:34,580
I call that the knowledge funnel, uh, down
the knowledge funnel. And I don't think,

782
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:37,700
I think integrative thinking
is a heuristic at this point.

783
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:42,500
It needs to be made more algorithmic
for machines to be able to do it.

784
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:47,240
And how far that can go. I mean, there
are, there are some things that have,

785
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:52,390
that have allowed themselves to be reduced
to code more quickly than other other

786
00:50:52,551 --> 00:50:54,560
things. Uh, we haven't figured out,

787
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:57,800
figure out a bunch of
bunch of things so that,

788
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:01,820
so it sort of a dependent would be my,
my view.

789
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:04,830
Um,
I somehow think that,

790
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:09,910
that the notion that machines
can get ahead of human beings,

791
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:16,580
uh, on the distillation of knowledge, um,

792
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:21,290
I'm, I'm probably, uh,
from Missouri on, um,

793
00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:26,420
but there would be other people who would
disagree and say, Oh, yes, they will.

794
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:31,730
But that's, I'll, I'll
believe it when I see it.

795
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:34,340
How do you deal with,
uh,

796
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:38,170
what seems to be a mutually exclusive
choice where integration is,

797
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:41,090
it's more difficult.
That's what this technique is for.

798
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:44,910
It's what for what appears
incommensurable choices.

799
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:51,680
So I,
I am not a believer that,

800
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:56,920
that the choices we feel are mutually
exclusive are as mutually exclusive as we

801
00:51:58,521 --> 00:51:59,354
think they are.

802
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:04,480
They're mutually exclusive only as long
as we think of them the way we do. And,

803
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:05,420
and,
and,

804
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:10,310
and one way that causes things to
be mutually exclusive in our mind is

805
00:52:10,311 --> 00:52:11,144
abstraction.

806
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:16,010
We abstract up to labels that
causes us to believe something.

807
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:17,540
Two things are mutually exclusive,

808
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:21,980
free or proprietary as how
can we be free proprietary?

809
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:26,450
Like it can't bigger, smaller. How can you
be bigger and smaller at the same time?

810
00:52:26,451 --> 00:52:27,380
You can't,
you can't.

811
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:32,980
But it turns out that those labels often
are abstractions that aren't helpful to

812
00:52:33,471 --> 00:52:37,220
our goal, which is to get a
better answer than those two.

813
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:40,870
So when I tell people is, is, you know,

814
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:44,240
don't live in the abstraction,
the answers,

815
00:52:44,241 --> 00:52:49,241
the integrative answers lie below the
abstractions in the mechanisms by which

816
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:51,530
you get to the abstraction.

817
00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:56,000
Are there areas where this type
of thinking will fall short?

818
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,600
I mean, I haven't seen them yet, but
they're, there may be, uh, once, I mean,

819
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:04,180
I guess in,
right?

820
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:08,460
Like in the course of human
endeavors, right? I, I think we,

821
00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:13,710
like, we've manufactured the
world that we, that we live in.

822
00:53:13,711 --> 00:53:18,240
It's not as unchanging as
people think it is. Uh,

823
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:23,190
and most, most times when we seem
to have an either or choice, it's,

824
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:26,730
it's a function of
believing in that it is,

825
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:31,290
and a function of living in an APP,
in a world of apps of abstraction.

826
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:36,300
So I haven't seen a domain where I can
say, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. In that domain,

827
00:53:36,301 --> 00:53:41,010
you just can't, it's just, there's,
there's no, no, there, there, I mean,

828
00:53:41,011 --> 00:53:45,720
there are some domains that are tougher
right? You know, wars are fought on,

829
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:49,760
on the basis of absolute
religious beliefs. Right?

830
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:55,590
Um, and people could say,
well, you know, those are,

831
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:59,340
those are, those are the either, either,
either or is there, but they're just,

832
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:02,070
they're either or is only as long as we,

833
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:06,990
we produce the either or and we produced
the either or by abstracting up to

834
00:54:06,991 --> 00:54:11,940
things that appear to be so contradictory,
nothing could ever,

835
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:15,000
ever be done. Uh, I just,

836
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:18,840
I just haven't seen ones where if,

837
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:23,280
if the people involved
value at better answer,

838
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:28,230
not a compromise, a just
plain better answer. Right.

839
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:33,710
Tiff is more inclusive than when then
that when a fierce handling started and

840
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:39,720
more important and richer
and has bigger buzz,

841
00:54:39,721 --> 00:54:44,580
then con
that you'd think that's impossible.

842
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:49,260
How can that be?
Because con is exclusive.

843
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:52,680
It's a nasty, elitist, exclusive thing.

844
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:59,010
Well, get below the
label. All right. Well,

845
00:54:59,011 --> 00:55:00,750
thank you, Roger. Thank you
everyone for [inaudible].

846
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:03,700
You're welcome.
[inaudible].
