1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,690
Okay. So let's get started. This is a
special, we'll talk in particular for me.

2
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,640
Uh, I want to introduce
you to [inaudible]. No, he
gets a very good friend.

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,070
I'm going to make the disclaimer
first. Uh, actually it's my, uh,

4
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,420
marriage witness.
So

5
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:30,600
we known each other for 16 years roughly.
Uh,

6
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:33,700
I'm not gonna give all the details of
how we met the challenge, so don't worry.

7
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:34,690
Uh,

8
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:39,690
we met in Argentina like a on the 31st
of December in a party and we have many

9
00:00:42,461 --> 00:00:47,080
friends in common and then we grew
over time on our friendship and uh,

10
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,990
now I wanted him to share
a little bit with you.

11
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:54,640
He's a track record what he has done in
business and of course her some advices

12
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:58,440
and things to you. So like, I
really like to start the first.

13
00:00:58,441 --> 00:01:00,640
I thank you for making the time and uh,

14
00:01:00,641 --> 00:01:02,830
I'm coming here and
joining us on a second.

15
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:07,390
Do you mind sharing a little bit of a
who you are and what is the company you

16
00:01:07,391 --> 00:01:08,224
created?

17
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:13,190
Okay. Hello everybody. I'm put
to dry my English that perfect.

18
00:01:13,191 --> 00:01:17,670
So what I will do my best if not the same
French, most of them understand. Okay.

19
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,520
I try. No, I will try in
English. I like challenges. Um,

20
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,500
thank you. You know, to invite me here.

21
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,880
I was supposed to be on holiday with
my family or four way, but you know,

22
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:33,540
wants to be back to work apparently. So,
uh, so now I'm very happy to be here. Uh,

23
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:38,020
very interesting for me to visit the
Google a few years to see a tight works

24
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:41,120
here and uh, and uh, I'm very, very happy.

25
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,610
So roughly I,

26
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:48,380
I'm I creating with a friend of
a company called line in 1999.

27
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,090
So it's a quite a long time ago.
Um, you are very, very young.

28
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,720
I was very young. No, it
was uh, not my first job.

29
00:01:56,721 --> 00:02:01,700
I had worked for two years before
in a very, in a company called ICI,

30
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,950
chemical inputs, chemicals industry.
So nothing in common with, uh,

31
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:10,740
um, technology. But at that
moment, I don't know, it's,

32
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,760
it was the beginning of Internet.
Everybody was setting up companies,

33
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:18,110
so it was really getting bored in this
big company. And I was thinking, uh,

34
00:02:18,111 --> 00:02:21,560
I should, uh, I should dive into
this, uh, this new movement.

35
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,650
So first, I, uh,

36
00:02:23,651 --> 00:02:28,651
I joined a startup who has cupping a
Ebay more or less in France and I'm on,

37
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:36,190
it was solo rapidly to a, to
another company. So I decided to,

38
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,080
to create as the line. So we had an
idea, I had an idea. It was that, uh,

39
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,223
every day,

40
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:47,240
lots of new websites were created in
France on most of them couldn't make money

41
00:02:47,241 --> 00:02:51,830
basically. Um, they were, oh, they
were all dreaming of making money,

42
00:02:51,831 --> 00:02:56,050
but they were too small. They had to,
the audience was too small to, to,

43
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,550
to make money basically. So
we thought, okay, if we could,

44
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:02,470
if we could all this
audience, uh, together,

45
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,940
if we make a big audience and we
could sell the advertising space,

46
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,710
it was a very simple idea.
And at that time, a good,

47
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,840
good at sense was
naturally here. Um, so, um,

48
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:17,250
w somebody, yeah, yeah. Was
good to here as well. And yeah,

49
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:20,530
it was maybe in the US,
but in France,

50
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:25,700
essence was not what was not here at
that time. So we first started, uh, uh,

51
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:29,190
to, uh, develop the technology
to a kind of a nutshell.

52
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:33,940
And that's a serving
technology, um, that could, uh,

53
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,890
uh, that make it easy for
webmaster to, to, to describe.

54
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:43,130
And, um, I bought a, uh,

55
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:47,790
so advertising pages in Geek
magazines with a very simple message.

56
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,800
It was a webmaster,
subscribe at the line and make money.

57
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:55,090
And we had a notch of success with this
very simple, uh, advertising campaign,

58
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:59,590
hundreds of websites every week where
subscribing because they had basically no

59
00:03:59,591 --> 00:04:03,350
solution to make money.
Uh, and that was here 2000,

60
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:07,720
19 to 2000, I would say. And, um,

61
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:12,280
so we were ready to, we have the stock
of, of advertising space to sell.

62
00:04:12,281 --> 00:04:17,281
So we started to sell it to advertising
agency basically on the strategy was to

63
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:22,560
sell a low price. So, um, we, uh,

64
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,550
created, um, a micro billing
solution to enable this website,

65
00:04:27,551 --> 00:04:32,070
some of these websites to, to put a
pay wall basically on the, on the,

66
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,820
on the pages. And it was a,
it was a very easy way to, uh,

67
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:42,680
to, uh, create this
pair work. Just a very,

68
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:43,870
very,
very easy way.

69
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:47,380
So as money in advertising disappeared
table was the solution you came up,

70
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,740
but it was a macro. So it was uh, um,

71
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,960
basically you had to, to, to,
to dial a premium, a phone,

72
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,970
a phone call, you get a tick a code
on a, you enter the code on the page,

73
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:05,800
you get the content. So it helped us
to go through this two years, 2001,

74
00:05:05,801 --> 00:05:10,210
2002, uh, what the market was very,

75
00:05:10,211 --> 00:05:11,044
very difficult.

76
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,300
And in 2003 when the market started again,

77
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,700
we had no more competitor
on the advertising part.

78
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,890
They were all there basically in France.
And um,

79
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,980
it was at that moment,

80
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:27,430
it was a very special moment because
of the markets started to be really a

81
00:05:27,431 --> 00:05:32,020
bullish. And, uh, we had a
very, very strong growth and uh,

82
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:36,790
in some area we didn't even,
we didn't have enough space to sell,

83
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,920
so we thought, okay, we don't
have enough space cells,

84
00:05:40,921 --> 00:05:44,310
so we're going to create this
space. So we started, uh, uh,

85
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,370
creating space and creating
websites basically. And big,

86
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,320
we became a publishers in some rough,

87
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,520
the first website was a zone Odessa,

88
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,100
it was a comparitor a price
comparison site. Yeah.

89
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,030
Comparison site for Isp,

90
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,900
because we had lots of advertising
advertisers at that time who were fighting

91
00:06:02,901 --> 00:06:06,390
for market share is up
in France. And then, uh,

92
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:09,480
because we had a very
strong growth, we, uh,

93
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:15,060
I met someone who proposed me to make
an IPU, basically because we had,

94
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:18,410
I met a guy and say, oh, you should make
an apo, or really, how does it work?

95
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,460
I had no idea. Basically and a while,
you always have experts everywhere.

96
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:27,200
So he explained me how it works and it
takes people who know how it works. And,

97
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:27,740
uh,

98
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:32,740
one year after we raised 15
million euro to an IPO and,

99
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:36,340
uh, basically it was to, um,

100
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:40,460
accelerate the movement towards publishing
because at that moment a Google was a

101
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:44,650
really ready with
essence. And, uh, so the,

102
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:49,850
the last 2007, 2008, no,
it was 2006, six. And,

103
00:06:49,851 --> 00:06:53,780
um, our strategy, which was a to go, uh,

104
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,980
to use the long tail of
basically of website, uh,

105
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,610
to, uh, to get back on
the advertising market.

106
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,630
Google was on the cake and we
had to find out quickly and, uh,

107
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:11,210
uh, a new, a new, a new
business. So I thought being,

108
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,750
um, uh, uh,

109
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:18,050
being a master of your website was the,
the solution.

110
00:07:18,051 --> 00:07:22,370
So we raised that money and we
invested in websites that were,

111
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:27,380
that were some of,
of where in our network we have a very,

112
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:31,640
a strategic vision of which websites
were accelerating more than others.

113
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:36,200
And, uh, so we invested
maybe a 10, uh, 10 websites.

114
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:41,030
Sometimes it was a minority stake.
Sometimes it was a majority stake.

115
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:45,150
Uh, we acquired, uh,
uh, associated account.

116
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:49,640
I know if you know it in
France, miserable that, uh, uh,

117
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:53,870
more or less than stellar
10 websites. And, um,

118
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:57,080
we continue the, um, the development until

119
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,650
2012. And, and, um,

120
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:07,520
and we sold the company actually
to, to a French, a big group. And,

121
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,770
uh, I'm still, uh, I'm still,
uh, CEO of the company.

122
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,820
Uh, so it's now four, five
years after when I sold it,

123
00:08:16,821 --> 00:08:21,020
I thought I would stay two
years and Leland finally,
I'm still here. I don't know.

124
00:08:21,021 --> 00:08:25,220
I don't know how it comes at. I'm
still here. They still like it. Yeah,

125
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,473
I dunno.

126
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:32,320
They maybe don't like it. I don't know.
But I'm still here. Uh, it was, uh,

127
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:36,380
four years ago I was, I got married.
I make three babies at that time.

128
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:40,510
So, um, I didn't waste my time,
I guess, you know, that come on.

129
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,760
I guess it's not that common that you
find somebody with a track record and the

130
00:08:45,761 --> 00:08:48,830
expertise. So even if, uh, uh, they,

131
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,080
they wanted to find somebody else,
uh,

132
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,620
I'm not sure we'll have the competencies
experience and they inserted well,

133
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,160
it's a very big challenge for big

134
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,100
groups. So that's how I don't have
the, the Internet culture too,

135
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:03,000
to what the investments in
smaller started like us.

136
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,880
It's very complicated to integrate them.
That's a very big problem.

137
00:09:05,881 --> 00:09:10,110
And I still don't know mia really.
I'm ready to go actually,

138
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:13,440
but I'm really scared of what, of what
they would do with the company after that.

139
00:09:13,441 --> 00:09:14,640
So,
and now we are,

140
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,920
I'm very attached to compare the
really care you're really a task.

141
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:21,720
But I think it's a very big challenge
for big groups to integrate because they

142
00:09:21,721 --> 00:09:25,140
have process, big process.
And uh, we are very, uh,

143
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:29,130
a giant company and uh, it's
very, it's a very big challenge.

144
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,470
But part of, uh, of uh, independence you
let to the, to the, to the company on.

145
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:39,410
If you don't have the founder who
will take the lead after it's,

146
00:09:39,411 --> 00:09:42,120
it's a bit complicated I
think. Okay. Not always easy.

147
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:47,390
So let me ask you a couple of things
into the scripture and you read another

148
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:48,710
line.
Um,

149
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:54,140
let's talk about the tough moments
because it's 2000, 2001, you know,

150
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:57,110
the stock market goes down,
there's no funding. Uh,

151
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,890
by the time there was not a lot of believe
into online advertising. Right? Um,

152
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,980
and then, uh, your main source or
only source of revenues goes away. Uh,

153
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,590
and then you can creatively within a
solution that lets you survive. Well,

154
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:15,300
what are the toughest moments
and what did you learn? Well,

155
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:20,310
I think the tough moments or first
to creation, when we started to,

156
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:24,890
we did a business plan, we went to see
a business angels on nobody first, uh,

157
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,940
very few people, uh, even very
bright and smart people. Uh,

158
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,310
the best educated people, but older
generation probably like me now. Uh,

159
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:36,730
but do you really believe
in this internet? I mean,
we have these type of, of,

160
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:41,610
of answers.
It was really amazing and I'm so it was,

161
00:10:41,611 --> 00:10:43,440
we tapped because we had
to start it without money.

162
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,290
Then after the second tough one,
you said it was a,

163
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:50,040
when the bubble exploded and we had no
more money and we have to find solutions.

164
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,230
And basically we were smoking.

165
00:10:52,231 --> 00:10:57,231
We were maybe a 12 or 12 people and
we had to get to sick to shrink to six

166
00:10:59,731 --> 00:11:04,110
people maybe. I guess we
nearly didn't get paid. Uh,

167
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,070
me and my partner, I slept in the
office during more than a year,

168
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:12,810
so it was really tough. Um, and
when, when the, um, when the,

169
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:17,580
the markets, I've, when I felt that
the market was, I'm starting again,

170
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:22,330
uh, because we had two business
Anja, I thought, okay, I want now,

171
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:26,130
now I'm ready to fight again,
but I don't want to fight for,

172
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,970
because we had lost the majority of the
company that was so I was not ready to

173
00:11:29,971 --> 00:11:33,410
fight to, to suffer again,
uh, for less than a majority.

174
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:38,420
So I offered the two business owner to
buy the shares for basically the price.

175
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,650
I,
I bought a,

176
00:11:40,651 --> 00:11:44,630
they bought them plus 5% per year and uh,

177
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:48,000
and accepted. So I sewed my, my
flight, which was my only, uh,

178
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:52,650
I had a small flat in Mamata I sold it
to but to buy it and plus I borrowed a

179
00:11:52,651 --> 00:11:57,250
bit at the bank. And you became a
homeless. Why your own company? Yes,

180
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,740
exactly.
But that's,

181
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:04,130
that was the time I slept in
the office secretary and uh,

182
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:11,470
and uh, but, uh, it was uh,
totally crazy. I would not,

183
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:15,580
I would never suggest
people to do that crazy.

184
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,760
I don't think your wife will appreciate
it if I post something like that was

185
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:24,110
crazy. But, uh, at the end of
the day of the date was, uh,

186
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,200
two years later we went to public. So, uh,

187
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,820
of course the value is not
at all the same amount.

188
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:34,700
You can imagine now a of the share.
But, uh, so it was a, it was crazy,

189
00:12:34,701 --> 00:12:37,520
but uh, it worked actually.
And uh, that's how it went.

190
00:12:37,521 --> 00:12:40,190
We went public and we had 100%
of the capital was my partner,

191
00:12:40,191 --> 00:12:43,410
which is quite rare in our
industry. Most of the, of the,

192
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:48,640
of the people who go pill down or they
are already diluted by many a vcs on an

193
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,273
business.
Sanchez.

194
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,600
You were just,

195
00:12:51,601 --> 00:12:54,780
you had the vision to trust and you
trust that your business so much that you

196
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,010
bought it again,
your sheriffs.

197
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:00,990
I, yeah, I think it was crazy. And, and
we were lucky, I think not only lucky,

198
00:13:00,991 --> 00:13:02,010
but also lucky.

199
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,840
And the more I work,
the luckier I get.

200
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,320
I don't know, but I wouldn't
do it today, which, sure. Sure.

201
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:12,450
Okay. So, um, I think that I
have some inside information,

202
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,350
no,

203
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:18,150
to complete the tough moment as ways to
sell the company is a very tough moment

204
00:13:18,151 --> 00:13:22,770
as well because you, you sell it on a,
you don't know if he's stupid or not.

205
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,070
Now I'm really happy to have
solid actually, but, uh,

206
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,670
it's a very tough moment
because you have to, you,

207
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,820
you have the impression too that you are
selling you your son or something that

208
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:36,720
belongs to you. It's very, very
emotional and very hard to,

209
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:41,250
it's a very hard money if even
if you basically get money. Okay.

210
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:46,050
So you're happy to get money and so at
least says so what now? And uh, it's very,

211
00:13:46,051 --> 00:13:49,360
very tough moment in
terms of emotion. And, um,

212
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,160
so let's,
let's for a second,

213
00:13:52,161 --> 00:13:56,360
I assume that anyone here
or anyone watching the video
are going to start their

214
00:13:56,361 --> 00:14:00,770
own company. What would be the top
three advices that you will give them?

215
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,910
Uh, to, uh, make sure that they maximize
their chances of being successful?

216
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,540
And I hope it's not sell your apartment,
investing in your own company.

217
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:13,580
No, no, really? I, it's very hard to
stu to give advices because me media,

218
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,030
lots of people give,
give you very bad advice basically.

219
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:24,520
No, it's true. A very, very smart
people always told me, okay,

220
00:14:24,521 --> 00:14:26,080
I know your business managers is okay,

221
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,740
but you should wait
two years and packages.

222
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:32,020
So I think the advice would be
not to listen too much to advices.

223
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:38,860
No, no. Hello. You are,
um, your faith. If, if you,

224
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:43,640
if you, you really need to have the
two to 12 the face in something,

225
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,470
in an idea, and you have to
be really willing to do, to,

226
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,590
to create your company.
If you're not ready,

227
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:54,940
if you just want to create a company
because it's fashionable to create a

228
00:14:54,941 --> 00:14:59,380
company because it's cool, it's, um,
you must be ready to suffer. And if,

229
00:14:59,381 --> 00:15:04,260
if you're, um, if you really have a
vision on faith, on a big whale, you,

230
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:08,770
you will not feel the, I mean, the bad
moments basically. And, uh, so you're,

231
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:13,590
you, my, my, my advice is, uh,

232
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:18,350
you have to follow your,
your idea and to you,

233
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:22,510
it must be strong. Not, not very smart
but very, very strong in you, in you.

234
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,810
And um,
my,

235
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:30,590
my advisor as well is you have to take
risks but so the sooner the better I

236
00:15:30,591 --> 00:15:34,000
would say because uh, for example,
me today I have three children,

237
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,480
I will not take the same risk.

238
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:38,330
It was not appropriate for me to
sleep in my office two years. It was,

239
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:43,190
I had nothing. I ha ha I had this little
flat. So if you fail, it's not a big deal.

240
00:15:43,191 --> 00:15:45,880
You know, you fail, you, you lose if you,

241
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:50,720
so the sooner the better I think don't
weight that your product is perfect

242
00:15:50,721 --> 00:15:54,690
before you go. I mean now I invest in, in,

243
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,610
in many companies on I,

244
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:01,670
that's kind of by some people who wants
to have something perfect before go. No,

245
00:16:01,671 --> 00:16:06,080
you go, you go on, you, you, you
repair on board, you return ball.

246
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,360
So that's,
that's my advice.

247
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,480
My advice it would be to trust for me are
very important too to share experience

248
00:16:13,581 --> 00:16:14,270
with someone.

249
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:19,220
You must have a dream or a vision and
you have to share it with someone because

250
00:16:19,221 --> 00:16:24,050
it's very bring the tough moment.
If you are alone, it's very so long.

251
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,820
It's a long journey. So it's
very tough to be alone. Me,

252
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:31,160
I could not have been alone.
So I have a very good friend is he has a,

253
00:16:31,161 --> 00:16:35,090
you can name him if you want.
[inaudible] is a very good fun.

254
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:39,560
He has a very good temper as well.

255
00:16:39,561 --> 00:16:42,890
So it's,
you have to to,

256
00:16:42,891 --> 00:16:46,210
to share the adventure with someone
that who have the same value as you.

257
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,910
Someone who will not kill you for money
for example. You know, or someone who, um,

258
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,190
who said, okay, this is a battle.
This is not an orange. You know,

259
00:16:55,191 --> 00:16:57,920
because in some situation people
say, no, sorry, it's not a battle.

260
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:02,660
In a ranch you have to share a vision.
Value is your partner.

261
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:06,230
And um,
as well for difficult moments,

262
00:17:06,231 --> 00:17:10,700
it's nice to have a partner on as well
to share if you have the best, uh,

263
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:15,770
best moment, if you are alone. It's
quite sad if you have a, you know,

264
00:17:15,771 --> 00:17:20,150
so it's better to, to, to, to
be, to, to share. And then after,

265
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:24,250
if you, uh, if you have
a good, a good team,

266
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:30,060
I would say the hard thing is to get with
people with you on the boat, which is,

267
00:17:30,061 --> 00:17:30,290
uh,

268
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:35,290
that's a such a beautiful board at the
beginning and you need to have a quality

269
00:17:36,141 --> 00:17:39,440
people on how to get them because you
know that all the best to go to either go

270
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:43,610
to Google or set up the company. So how
do you do? Wait, we are happy with that.

271
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,070
They're happy.
They come to us a big problem.

272
00:17:46,071 --> 00:17:48,200
So how do you do so you
have to share your dream to,

273
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:51,100
you have to be very
enthusiastic, yes. To, uh,

274
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:54,490
to make a nice people come on
board with you. You have to share.

275
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:59,540
You don't have to be nice to people to
be so that good people join John Your,

276
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,360
I don't show me.
Basically,

277
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,860
I'm going ask you a little bit now on,

278
00:18:04,861 --> 00:18:08,620
on your angel investments and then start
thinking about questions if you want to

279
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:12,280
make and then I'll give it to you less.
So when you sold the company,

280
00:18:12,281 --> 00:18:16,390
you are still are the CEO
of the company. Uh, but now,

281
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,343
well,

282
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:22,640
the bank account is a little bit better
and you are expanding your reach. Now.

283
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,500
What is in your mind?
What are you doing?

284
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:28,610
How would you like to approach a future
investments and things like that?

285
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:35,180
Well, um, it was a big, it's
a big question. When you
sell your company, you know,

286
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,950
what am I going to do next on it?
So it's a big question on youtube,

287
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,350
too young to retire. Um, you have,

288
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:46,930
you have not updated your dreams
because when you create your company,

289
00:18:46,931 --> 00:18:49,410
you are new. And when you're
25, I don't know, maybe you,

290
00:18:49,411 --> 00:18:53,850
you dream of going surfing on the beach,
uh, uh, if you had enough money to and to,

291
00:18:53,851 --> 00:18:57,880
to stop working on when you sold your
company, you're nearly 40 and say,

292
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,670
I don't want to go anymore surfing and
a bitch. Nobody's there. And all my,

293
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:05,170
so what, what, what? I'm too fat anyway,

294
00:19:05,171 --> 00:19:09,770
so it's too late. So you have to update
you. You have not updated your dreams.

295
00:19:09,771 --> 00:19:13,170
So it's very big. It's
kind of a trauma, you know?

296
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:16,950
So it's very hard to,
very hard to, to, to,

297
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,990
to readapt yourself too.
What am I going to do?

298
00:19:19,991 --> 00:19:24,340
So first I started to invest in companies.
So,

299
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,870
but it's a bit frustrating investing
because you aren't, you you invest on,

300
00:19:28,871 --> 00:19:33,220
it's like a then always Amy
money. No, we were quite lucky.

301
00:19:33,221 --> 00:19:34,740
I mean I have invested in,

302
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:39,520
one of my first investment was sold to
Google was a company called mage talk.

303
00:19:39,521 --> 00:19:42,180
It was a, uh, um, a visual

304
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,120
software on a,
so to Google.

305
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:52,650
So we had a good adventures. I had
nothing to have nothing. And uh,

306
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,010
what needs to be, it's frustrating
when you, when you are an entrepreneur,

307
00:19:56,011 --> 00:19:59,370
you want to, you want to lead your own
board basically. Yeah. And you, you,

308
00:19:59,371 --> 00:20:02,040
you don't want to put money in a,
you know,

309
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:06,030
it's like buying a foot rest and wait
five years or so she's got growth. Uh,

310
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,660
you know, it's not, it's not for
me. It's not in, it's not enough.

311
00:20:09,661 --> 00:20:13,160
So I think I will create something.
Something else. Uh, I'm not,

312
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,280
I'm not sure exactly what,
but um,

313
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,420
I know some of your side business

314
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:24,010
project. Yes, I have a few
projects, but for sure I will, uh,

315
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:28,240
I will start again as something
a big or not, but nice.

316
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,200
That's, um, guys, you have any questions?

317
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:37,780
I hope you understood what I said
because it was a bit confused.

318
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,550
They have a chip is Google translate
so don't worry, they get everything.

319
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,290
You stopped to the,
um,

320
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,840
you call ins.
Others,

321
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:07,910
how easy talking today,
the main source are.

322
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,370
So Steeler kind of fat cells or how is

323
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,590
no,
I've changed,

324
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:20,300
we are not anymore on the long tail.
We are now,

325
00:21:20,301 --> 00:21:25,210
we have a big websites in a
contract with big, big websites.

326
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:28,340
So we have moved the from uh, the, uh,

327
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:33,200
small websites too big websites basically.
So we have a more traditional,

328
00:21:33,201 --> 00:21:37,000
uh, network, uh, advertising
network business.

329
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:42,470
It's still a, I would say, uh, nearly
half of the business of the company.

330
00:21:42,471 --> 00:21:47,471
But it's a tough business because now
you knew in France you have to be a quite

331
00:21:48,111 --> 00:21:51,710
big, you have a, we have 25 million
unique users in France and I,

332
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:56,690
I would say it's the minimum not to
lose money or in, uh, so it's, it's the,

333
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:01,280
the, the growth is, is quite, uh,
quite low. Uh, we are still on,

334
00:22:01,281 --> 00:22:05,200
um, the micro billing, uh, still a,

335
00:22:05,201 --> 00:22:10,120
it's still a good business, but we
have, uh, adapted it as well to the, um,

336
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,940
because of pay pal now is everywhere
on all the need to call anymore.

337
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,760
We have the, we have adapted it to
put more services with the, with,

338
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:23,270
with our billing because just the billing.
Now big companies are in this market.

339
00:22:23,271 --> 00:22:24,104
So we,

340
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:29,270
we tried to put a service layer
of service with a voice basically.

341
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:34,880
Um, you guys are now on this market
as well. We are everywhere. Um,

342
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:37,460
but it's still a good
business and I believe in, uh,

343
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,270
in billing services through voice,
um,

344
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:44,040
and the publishing,
uh,

345
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:48,320
it's still good and we have a,

346
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:53,870
we have one website that make
the money from, for the others.

347
00:22:53,871 --> 00:22:58,220
I would say we have a leader, uh, in, um,

348
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:02,780
facilities or companies is still making
good money. Basically we are selling,

349
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:07,440
we are selling, uh, uh,

350
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:12,320
information information on the company's
financial information companies. We buy,

351
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:17,240
uh,
we buy raw information,

352
00:23:17,241 --> 00:23:21,680
we clean it,
and we sell it in retail

353
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:27,020
and with Google's Bella, Bella? Yes, yes.

354
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:49,130
Well, uh, I'm not sure it's very
rational. I would say there's a,

355
00:23:49,131 --> 00:23:52,480
a large part of instinct,
um,

356
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:56,810
that I feel through the exchange,

357
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:02,330
the talk with the founders and, um, I, uh,

358
00:24:02,331 --> 00:24:05,900
invest very early stage and
so I would say no money.

359
00:24:05,901 --> 00:24:10,400
The statistic is you invest in
10 companies and uh, when uh,

360
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:12,830
goes a well on most of the others died.

361
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:16,370
Basically that's supposed to be a
statistic for us. It's not a statistic.

362
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:21,140
We are much better than this because I
invest with my partner and we would say

363
00:24:21,141 --> 00:24:22,190
we have no,

364
00:24:22,191 --> 00:24:26,300
we have one company which is in
difficulty out of maybe 15 company,

365
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:30,690
but most most of them that are in good
shape. And so I would say instant,

366
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:35,320
uh, of, of the determination
I have in the, um,

367
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:40,280
the founders, the founders, I would
say it's the first, uh, it's my,

368
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:45,010
uh, my first, uh, key
and the business itself,

369
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:47,330
of course the business

370
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:52,820
you need to be on the market
that is coming. You must,

371
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,420
I don't invest in where there's no market
basically with where it's too soon,

372
00:24:56,421 --> 00:24:59,330
you know, the timing and
the time to market is very
important for us. For example,

373
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,970
we were very lucky because
of the time to market it.

374
00:25:01,971 --> 00:25:04,610
Plus not a strategic was
luck basically, but, uh,

375
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,970
two years before we would have died
two years after it was too late.

376
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,410
So that time to market is
very, very important. And uh,

377
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,920
but basically the profile of the founder
is very important because you have to

378
00:25:15,921 --> 00:25:19,720
adapt all the time. If, if, if,

379
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:23,420
if you have someone who is not able to do,
is to sure of where he wants to go,

380
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:27,710
it's not good because you need
people who are very fast, who was,

381
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,410
who are ready to change very fast,

382
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:34,460
can adapt them a business
model very fast. So, um,

383
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:41,030
I don't invest in people who are to
show of themselves basically, uh,

384
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:45,530
because, uh, you need to be
humble. I guess I'm going
to uni started company. So,

385
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:49,970
um, and I, um, and after it's, uh,

386
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,950
yeah, it's, it's, it's a part
of a instinct of self first.

387
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,810
And of course I know a
bit the market as well.

388
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:01,430
I invest in intern mainly on
internet businesses, so I know

389
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:07,520
a lot of the ecosystem, few things, few
things. And I tried to invest not a,

390
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:11,930
uh, on a singular person, businesses.

391
00:26:11,931 --> 00:26:15,980
And so I liked to have access
to partner three partners. Good.

392
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,690
Uh, like a technical guy, a business
guy, and a design guy for example,

393
00:26:20,691 --> 00:26:24,720
is fantastic. That's the
best, uh, the best, uh,

394
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:28,610
technology I would say. And, um,

395
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:34,700
there's no, I don't have like
my five rules for investment.
I don't have this. And,

396
00:26:34,701 --> 00:26:39,410
uh, but, uh, in five years, five years,

397
00:26:39,411 --> 00:26:43,980
I would add alarm. I will have a good
view if I a good investor or not.

398
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,930
For now it's, it's too sooner.
Maybe I would have one we had to,

399
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:50,760
to come here was sold
already. Good, good. Uh,

400
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:55,800
no to yes, yes. And uh,

401
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:59,010
I'm still optimistic and
most of them. And uh, so,

402
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:04,140
but we will bring him back again in
five years and then he would, yes.

403
00:27:04,141 --> 00:27:06,000
Yes, I would come. Okay.

404
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,690
And do you think the same

405
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,880
today or in the bus?
Okay,

406
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,890
what a good question for me.
I find it more,

407
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,550
it's much harder today than 20 years ago
because 20 years ago there was a big,

408
00:27:29,551 --> 00:27:32,520
big, uh, thing. It was a internet was new.

409
00:27:32,521 --> 00:27:36,390
So this a disruption was so huge.
You don't have,

410
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:38,690
you don't find this disruption today.
I mean,

411
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,560
so even someone stupid would jump into
the water or no would follow the currents

412
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:46,980
and we'll do something. I would
say, uh, it's a bit of a joke,

413
00:27:46,981 --> 00:27:51,230
but it's not totally a joke if you
are in the, in the right moment.

414
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,990
Uh, now I find it very difficult. Why?

415
00:27:54,991 --> 00:27:59,991
Because all the smart people going out
of a big university business school,

416
00:28:00,771 --> 00:28:01,980
they,
all three companies,

417
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:07,560
they all read the same newspaper
or they worked for Luder. No,

418
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:11,690
but the, the, Oh, they work for good.
It's true. So you have a swimming.

419
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:15,870
I received maybe a 10
business plan every week.

420
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,920
People who want to raise money
and quality of people is amazing.

421
00:28:19,921 --> 00:28:24,921
The quite the business
plan are fantastic and uh,

422
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:28,590
it's, it's, it's very hard to find space.

423
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,340
You will have so many brightest bright
people, smart people, Great Company today.

424
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,340
I mean, I'm sure they will. Not
all sepsis for sure. For sure.

425
00:28:35,341 --> 00:28:39,660
So I find it more difficult now than
20 years ago because you have much more

426
00:28:39,661 --> 00:28:43,630
people and you don't have such
a big disruption. Maybe I was,

427
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,980
I was saying to truly know, I
would say I'm a blockchain is, is,

428
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:51,330
is there interesting. Yeah.
Blockchain for me is, uh,

429
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:55,080
probably the big disruption to
my, in my opinion, in my opinion,

430
00:28:55,081 --> 00:29:00,081
but the other disruption are
like extension of previous,

431
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:00,690
uh,

432
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:05,280
disruptions I would say like mobile or
video and all these big companies are

433
00:29:05,281 --> 00:29:06,950
already there. You know, uh,

434
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:10,920
you have to go and it's very
nice when you're going to market,

435
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:15,740
not mature on a bit Celtic where
big companies, big organization,

436
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:16,603
and it's a,

437
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:21,360
it's that easy for them to say blockchain
is perfect for this, I would say.

438
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,560
So. What do you think about
the future of club team?

439
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:37,540
Well, uh, people have had the same
idea with the Internet, you know,

440
00:29:37,541 --> 00:29:39,400
and the people very smart,

441
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:43,240
educated people told me that
Internet is a burger, you know,

442
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:47,010
so I hear the same as this blockchain.
So I think, oh, that's probably good.

443
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:51,010
Something good, you know? And,
uh, I, that's why I want to,

444
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,900
I want to dig in, in this direction. Now.
I think blockchain is something really,

445
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:58,710
really, uh, I don't understand very
well blockchain, to tell you the truth,

446
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,480
I don't understand
everything and induction,

447
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:04,410
but I feel that this is something a very,

448
00:30:04,411 --> 00:30:09,300
very deceptive that will change a lot of
things, like a new dimension of, of, uh,

449
00:30:09,301 --> 00:30:10,710
of business.
Interestingly,

450
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:24,230
I'm successful now whether its
founding a company or selling it or,

451
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,400
or does it not work like that?
No,

452
00:30:26,401 --> 00:30:29,870
I'm not gonna have a problem with the
world of success. I know. So that's why,

453
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:33,170
you know, success for me is
something really weird. You know, uh,

454
00:30:33,171 --> 00:30:36,010
I don't know if you have read this
in the newspaper. You have a, uh,

455
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:38,580
Albert Einstein. He just, uh, uh,

456
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:42,520
wrote and he wrote a note of paperwork
that was sort of million dollar in an

457
00:30:42,521 --> 00:30:45,180
auction or yesterday or the day before.
And it was a,

458
00:30:45,181 --> 00:30:49,100
it was a literal world success
and happiness, you know, and, uh,

459
00:30:49,101 --> 00:30:50,690
he said basically that,
um,

460
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:55,500
he had found the secret of happiness
that it was not, uh, not, uh,

461
00:30:55,580 --> 00:31:00,380
tried to find a success success at
old price. So success for me, it's,

462
00:31:00,381 --> 00:31:04,880
it's something, uh, so we had, um, world,

463
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:09,050
I don't really, uh, feel I
had success. And, uh, for me,

464
00:31:09,051 --> 00:31:13,340
success is to achieve your goal and
try to be happy. That's the only, uh,

465
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:18,160
uh, success you may have in
the life, my opinion. So, uh,

466
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:24,290
if you are, if you are lucky to make
a business and to put the successful,

467
00:31:24,291 --> 00:31:29,240
maybe develop it so they
make money is nice. But, uh,

468
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:34,020
so it's kind of a success, but if you,
you have many little success every day.

469
00:31:34,021 --> 00:31:36,890
So I never had this,

470
00:31:36,891 --> 00:31:41,480
the idea of having made
the success on, uh, oh,

471
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,770
it's, uh, for me, um, it was, uh, uh,

472
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:50,330
an obligation to do, to, to create my
company because I, I, I hate others.

473
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:54,830
I don't like a Yorkie and disciplines or
not. So I had no choice basically. So.

474
00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:01,220
So, uh, so that's why I created a
company. So it was not a success.

475
00:32:01,221 --> 00:32:05,690
It was the survival a thing, you know, so,

476
00:32:05,691 --> 00:32:09,890
so in a way it was a s I
survived in a way, so, oh well

477
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,230
my idea was that we were lucky, very
lucky. I was saying we are very lucky.

478
00:32:15,231 --> 00:32:16,320
It's just a new lead.

479
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:21,040
But we were very lucky in all the stories
and I think I'm a very lucky person.

480
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,540
And,
uh,

481
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,890
but luck is of course a being rapid in
grabbing opportunities now for sure. But,

482
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:30,850
uh, so I, I grabbed a
thesis if I can, of course.

483
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,630
Yes, yes, yes,

484
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:44,470
yes, yes, yes.

485
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:49,500
So well where we, Nigga, I
negotiated in the deal to,

486
00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:52,840
to keep my office far from their office,

487
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,030
let's that of the dealer.
And um,

488
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:02,490
they're respecting that I worry that
they watched this or this is to preserve

489
00:33:02,491 --> 00:33:07,220
the culture. I know it's a big challenge
for, for, for, for companies to,

490
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:10,490
uh, Lopez for example, they
want to, of course, to, to,

491
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,850
to have a digital culture because they
have a big problem, you know, nobody,

492
00:33:13,851 --> 00:33:16,190
you anymore,
the stamps business,

493
00:33:16,191 --> 00:33:20,440
which is a 20 billion euro turnover in
France is decreasing 10% of the year.

494
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,230
So it's, wow, what do you do?
You have to find solutions.

495
00:33:23,231 --> 00:33:28,200
So when the strategy is to buy
companies, uh, digital companies to,

496
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:31,850
to prepare the future,
but the answer, the,

497
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:36,290
how do you do the integrate that there
have not my opinion in my opinion, uh,

498
00:33:36,291 --> 00:33:40,400
answer this question on, uh,
the fact that we're still here.

499
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:44,080
If that's okay, what are, what's
going to happen when we're,

500
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,020
when we're going to leave?

501
00:33:45,021 --> 00:33:48,470
Because the country is so different
and we fight to keep our culture,

502
00:33:48,471 --> 00:33:51,980
basically we fight to a certain extent.
Basically.

503
00:33:51,981 --> 00:33:53,870
I'm gonna say we fight,

504
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:59,090
we say we think it's a good
a idea to let us very, very,

505
00:33:59,091 --> 00:34:02,130
uh, far from you. If you
want to keep the, the,

506
00:34:02,131 --> 00:34:05,800
the good people they're going to
leave if you put too much Yaki,

507
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:10,730
too much processes that
Dumas on [inaudible] on this,

508
00:34:10,731 --> 00:34:11,564
right?
Yes.

509
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:17,300
But it's a big challenge for them to be
a big challenge because I read something

510
00:34:17,301 --> 00:34:17,900
on it,
but a,

511
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:22,900
the L'Oreal a CEO today who said
that a digital culture come from the,

512
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:27,380
the, the ground that from the top.
You can't say, I want my group to be,

513
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:31,370
have a digital culture now. And you
say, do it now. It doesn't work.

514
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:36,170
This grows from the ground on. Um, so, um,

515
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:40,000
big challenge I would say,
but then they're not too
bad. They're not too bad in,

516
00:34:40,001 --> 00:34:41,600
in, in, in doing this.

517
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,020
Any last questions guys?

518
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:52,430
If not, we're going to do something very
important. We are embarked lake, uh,

519
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:56,880
to be a mentor for Google as well.
Thank you. Can you call out for the,

520
00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:02,070
for the teachers? Okay.
Next time he comes,

521
00:35:02,071 --> 00:35:06,360
we can mentor a few, a few startup
scene here in the Mena region.

522
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,760
I love Google.
I bought shares

523
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:15,620
[inaudible].
