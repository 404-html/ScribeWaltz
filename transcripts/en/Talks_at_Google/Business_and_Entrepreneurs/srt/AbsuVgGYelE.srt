00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,930
Prior to joining Brac in 2011 he was the
executive director at Goldman Sachs and

10
00:00:48,361 --> 00:00:49,710
previously worked for IBM.

sectors to develop and scale innovations

14
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:08,610
that uplift some of the
world's poorest people.

15
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:14,570
A bit of context on Brac brack is the
world's largest nonprofit organization and

16
00:01:14,971 --> 00:01:16,140
is based in Bangladesh.

17
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,880
It's a global leader in developing and
implementing cost effective evidence

18
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:25,881
based programs to assist more marginalized
people and extremely poor conflict

19
00:01:26,101 --> 00:01:28,410
prone and post disaster settings.

20
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,900
These include initiatives in
education, healthcare, micro finance,

21
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,880
girls' empowerment, agriculture,
human and legal rights, and more.

22
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,130
In 2016,

23
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:46,550
brack employed more than 110,000
people in 11 countries with a global

24
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,860
expenditure of about 900 million.

25
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,600
With low middle income countries
like Bangladesh develop,

26
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,950
developing very rapidly,

27
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,720
both high and low tech solutions will be
instrumental in bridging group growing

28
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:05,721
socio economic divide as
it provides insight on how
Brac we'll reach 130 million

29
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:12,270
people and changing the way poverty
is addressed worldwide. Thank you.

30
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,253
Please take the floor.

31
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:21,180
Okay.

32
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,070
Let me start off talking about a little
bit about myself. Uh, just to give up,

33
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,090
give up personal context.

34
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,770
I grew up in Bangladesh and
that when I was 18, I left, uh,

35
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,290
to get my higher education
in the United States.

36
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,900
So I got a degree in computer
science. Um, and uh, when I graduated,

37
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:44,670
what I wanted to do with my life was
more about solving business problems.

38
00:02:44,671 --> 00:02:49,020
Then I graduated at the time when there
was tech jobs were quite plentiful.

39
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,050
And, um, I,

40
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:56,310
I landed with four offers
before I finished my graduation
and I decided to take

41
00:02:56,671 --> 00:02:59,530
up a job at Goldman Sachs. And, uh, um,

42
00:02:59,531 --> 00:03:03,670
my motivation was that I didn't want to
be a programmer who was just coding at

43
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:06,760
the back bench,
just nobody looks at him.

44
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,210
I actually want it to be what I
work with people and solve problems.

45
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,770
And before I knew it,

46
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,300
I spent almost a 12
years at Goldman and um,

47
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,010
but,
uh,

48
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:21,850
working with trading and electronic
trading algorithms and all these things,

49
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,560
but something was not
quite right. And, um, this,

50
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,530
I felt like this was not quite
about what I was meant to do,

51
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:34,060
probably not the kind of problems I wanted
to solve with for the rest of my life.

52
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,680
So I started a charity back
in 2001 and my free time, uh,

53
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:43,681
which was a platform for diaspora
Bangladeshis to connect and also work on a

54
00:03:44,411 --> 00:03:47,830
cause for human rights, uh,
victims in Bangladesh. And a,

55
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:50,840
the idea was that to raise awareness,
uh,

56
00:03:50,841 --> 00:03:54,640
on human rights issues and
also to rehabilitate them
and glad to see there is a

57
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:59,620
fellow member here as [inaudible] who
was here, who was a member of this.

58
00:03:59,621 --> 00:04:03,220
And I connected with a lot of young
Bangladeshis during that time.

59
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:08,370
And the organization actually,
uh, grew quite rapidly. Um,

60
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,400
before I knew it,

61
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:14,050
we had like nine chapters in nine
cities and we were connected, uh,

62
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:19,051
all around the world and we were doing
projects and we had 5,000 people in our

63
00:04:19,241 --> 00:04:23,550
network. Uh, so, and that was my thing. I,

64
00:04:23,551 --> 00:04:28,540
I figured that this is something
that I was prone to do. And,

65
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:31,180
uh, so I, I had to take a leap of faith.

66
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:35,770
I had to decide what I wanted to do
that with the rest of my life. So, um,

67
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:40,810
at one point I decided to end my career
at Goldman and moved back to Bangladesh

68
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,350
and, um, started to work
in the development sector.

69
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:49,450
And then that's where they were kind
of the rest of my life started. So I,

70
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:53,950
um, I actually from the number
one investment bank, uh,

71
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:58,810
I joined the number one NGO, which
is the Brac. So quite a, quite a,

72
00:04:58,811 --> 00:05:02,020
quite a large shift.
But interestingly,

73
00:05:02,021 --> 00:05:05,140
from what to add to what
Sylvia said about Brag, uh,

74
00:05:05,141 --> 00:05:07,150
I think when I joined Bragg,

75
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:12,210
it was a quite an interesting learning
because a Brac is something so unique

76
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:13,890
that uh,

77
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,960
there isn't a lot of charity
organizations like Brag because um,

78
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,280
I'm Brad kind of users,

79
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,470
whatever works to solve
a development problems.

80
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:29,350
So whether it's a business is, it's a
market based solutions, I think it's,

81
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,080
it's fairly agnostic to what
kind of solution would work.

82
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:37,470
And that resulted to brag from being a
very small relief organizations to what a

83
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:40,450
giant bay mode that is right now,
which has very,

84
00:05:40,451 --> 00:05:45,340
very large scale programs in
education law running the largest,

85
00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:50,341
a non government school network to one
of the largest microfinance network to a

86
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,520
very big health networks
all around the country.

87
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,970
And it expanded outside Bangladesh
about 12 years ago now it's in 12 other

88
00:05:58,971 --> 00:06:03,260
countries. So as you heard that, you
know, it's a total budget in global,

89
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:08,261
but it is about one point $1 billion with
about 70% of Bangladeshis budget comes

90
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:13,640
from its own resources.
And we are slowly towards a,

91
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:18,530
are on a path to become self dependent
for our Bangladesh programs in the next

92
00:06:18,531 --> 00:06:21,230
five to seven years. So, um,

93
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,980
but what a Brac has is that,
you know,

94
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,070
it's quite unique in the sense that it
has these large scale programs that I

95
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:31,100
mentioned.
It also has about 15 social enterprises.

96
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:35,340
It has about seven large
investments that it made, um,

97
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:40,280
from a bank to insurance companies to um,

98
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:44,000
various, uh, uh, other at a
university is, it's, it's,

99
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:48,750
it's a quite unique, but there is
a kind of a method to all this,

100
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,310
uh, large expansion. And
in order to get to that,

101
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:56,420
I think I should talk about
a quote that our founder,

102
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,000
surface foster has an APP.
It talks about a lot of time,

103
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:02,930
which is a poverty is not just
poverty of money or income.

104
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:08,360
We also see a poverty of self esteem,
hope, opportunity and freedom.

105
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:13,870
People trapped in a cycle of destitution
often don't realize their lives can be

106
00:07:14,031 --> 00:07:17,180
changed for the better
through their own activities.

107
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,110
Once they understand that,
it's like a light gets turned on.

108
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:25,490
So at Brac we are in the business of
turning those lights on. So where there,

109
00:07:25,491 --> 00:07:30,491
it's about financial inclusion
or education or any of
our livelihood's program,

110
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,990
it's all about turning that light on,

111
00:07:32,991 --> 00:07:36,020
giving people the tool so that
they can change their lives.

112
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:41,810
So today I'm going to
tell you two stories,

113
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,560
uh, 30 years apart, uh,

114
00:07:44,561 --> 00:07:48,740
about two of the biggest challenges
we've faced and what we learned about the

115
00:07:48,741 --> 00:07:52,250
role of technology and social
innovation in those challenges. Um,

116
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:58,600
so first case story is about a fairly
low tech solution with a high touch

117
00:07:59,901 --> 00:08:01,980
approach.
Um,

118
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:06,960
imagine you are an illiterate mother.
Um,

119
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:10,220
back in the early eighties in Bangladesh,
in the rural Bangladesh,

120
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,190
you live in an extremely remote region.
Uh,

121
00:08:13,191 --> 00:08:17,570
the country's still reeling economy
Lee from the war that happened about 10

122
00:08:17,571 --> 00:08:20,780
years ago.
But this isn't your biggest concern.

123
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:25,990
Your concern is about your sexual sec
child was suffering from diarrhea and uh,

124
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:32,390
your thoughts are consumed with her
because you don't know what to do.

125
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,610
The nearest hospital is about five miles.

126
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,460
You don't have the money to
take your child to the hospital.

127
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:41,300
You don't have access to
any physician a nearby.

128
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:46,040
So what do you do in that situation?
Um,

129
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,820
particularly when you know that about one
out of five children in your community

130
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,230
dies in a suffering from
diarrhea. Um, diarrhea,

131
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:59,260
dehydration that caused from diarrhea
and cholera was one of the primary

132
00:08:59,491 --> 00:09:03,900
killers, uh, of child under
five, uh, in, in Bangladesh.

133
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:08,910
A about one out of seven children in
Bangladesh in the right after a war would

134
00:09:08,911 --> 00:09:11,400
actually won't make it
to their fifth birthday.

135
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,120
So when that's the
scenario you're working on,

136
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:20,570
actually this kind of related of
why we had so many children a,

137
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,380
each household had so many children in
there because if you don't know how many

138
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:29,220
would survive, you actually don't think
about family planning that much. Uh,

139
00:09:29,221 --> 00:09:33,060
actually recently there was a code
by Melinda Gates the other day who

140
00:09:33,061 --> 00:09:36,810
highlighted that if parents believe their
children will survive and if they have

141
00:09:36,811 --> 00:09:40,230
the power to time and space
their pregnancies, they chew,

142
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,850
they would choose to have fewer children.

143
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,980
So parents living in poverty in rural
Bangladesh didn't have control of what

144
00:09:45,981 --> 00:09:49,080
their children's lives or,
or their futures.

145
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:54,810
So it wasn't that there wasn't
a solution, uh, available.

146
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,300
There was actually in the 60s,

147
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,990
there was a breakthrough in
treatment for diarrhea, right?

148
00:10:00,991 --> 00:10:04,440
A concoction of water sugar and

149
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:11,060
salt called oral rehydration therapy or
OT was tested by a group of researchers.

150
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,050
However, um, this, this
concoction that you, if you give,

151
00:10:16,051 --> 00:10:18,000
given to the children at the right time,

152
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:23,210
it would actually save 96.5% of the
children as opposed to 70% who would not

153
00:10:23,551 --> 00:10:24,384
make it.

154
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,340
But the problem there was another problem
with the treatment was out of reach

155
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:34,510
for poor families and remained
mostly in the hospitals because, uh,

156
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,740
one, uh, you have to get
the proportion right.

157
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,580
The researchers did have the idea that,
um,

158
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,750
that at some point they will,
um,

159
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:48,330
marketed and they will make the
instruction available for people.

160
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:52,590
But when you have illiterate
mothers all around the country,

161
00:10:52,591 --> 00:10:56,650
that instruction is actually not
very useful when you have, um,

162
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:00,960
instructions about giving spoons
and measurements, right. When you,

163
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:04,590
most of the households don't have
even spoons doesn't really work.

164
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:08,760
So what, uh, what do you do
in that kind of situation?

165
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:12,630
Because if you don't get the measurement
right, if you have too much salt,

166
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,270
it may kill your baby.
If you have too much sugar,

167
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,410
it may actually reverse the effect
of the Ortiz what is aligned.

168
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,290
So that's where the,

169
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:26,600
I guess the power of delivery
comes in around that time. Uh,

170
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:29,620
so brack was about 10 years old and um,

171
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:35,070
there was a guy called surface that
has an abbot who moved back from London

172
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:39,540
living his cushy job at Shell oil and uh,

173
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,890
and decided that he was going to
actually work towards rebuilding the,

174
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:46,290
rebuilding the country
after the war. And, uh,

175
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,440
pretty soon the relief organization
actually slowly expanded or,

176
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:56,730
um, into other, other
development activities. And, um,

177
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:01,890
he was from the private sector and he
understood scale very well and he was all

178
00:12:02,921 --> 00:12:05,560
about problem solving.
So when he heard about the problem,

179
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,540
one of the things that he tried,

180
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,830
but he was started experimenting in
this kitchen with unrefined sugar,

181
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:14,170
known as good in Bangladesh,

182
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,340
which is fairly well available
in rural areas, rural areas.

183
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,720
So he found out that about
three finger pinch of salt,

184
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:26,280
a handful of sugar, um, good. Um,

185
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,750
and half a liter of boiled water
actually can make the same,

186
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:36,260
have the same effect that this World
Health Organization that came up with the

187
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:41,080
antidote for the RT solution.
So,

188
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:46,330
so that's how the easy to
make solution arrived. Um,

189
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:50,560
but then how do you actually teach
it to the rest of the country?

190
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:54,230
How do you actually go to mothers and
tell them that this is actually going to

191
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,600
work and this is what you should do?

192
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,090
So that's where the
biggest challenge came in.

193
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:03,710
And the, and World Bank's
president recently said, uh,

194
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,650
at a code that it's not the question
of what to deliver. It's about,

195
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:13,630
it's about how to deliver it in the,
when in the social development space.

196
00:13:13,631 --> 00:13:17,050
It's all about, not the, not
the digital innovation itself,

197
00:13:17,051 --> 00:13:19,030
but how do you actually
deliver the innovation.

198
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:23,200
So our media advocacy campaign
would have worked at that time.

199
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:27,640
I wouldn't have worked at
that time because only 20%
people have access to radio

200
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:32,290
and television. So it would have
to be centered on the ground,

201
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:35,650
people talking to people,
people changing behaviors.

202
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,900
So that's what Brac started to do.

203
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:43,170
So it recruited that small groups of
women from communities to become health

204
00:13:43,871 --> 00:13:47,830
promoters themselves.
The group traveled on foot,

205
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:53,260
um, went door to door, showing
mothers how to make these solutions.

206
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:58,420
Later monitors went in and checked
whether how many of those mothers actually

207
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:02,650
learned how to make those solutions.
And it was an iterative process.

208
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:07,360
There was failures and plentiful we
learned as we go along. Went along,

209
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,880
so stuff to it, their approach as
they went along. And, and one thing,

210
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,570
I'm sorry, just to, and, and,

211
00:14:15,571 --> 00:14:20,320
and one example of our learning has been
that when the monitors went back after

212
00:14:20,321 --> 00:14:22,140
the first lot of training happen,

213
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:27,570
we found out that about 90% of this
mothers learn how to make those solutions.

214
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,160
So you would think that was a success,

215
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:35,170
but only 10% of them actually gave it
to their children when the children were

216
00:14:35,171 --> 00:14:39,580
sick. So people were struck scratching
their heads what went wrong.

217
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:44,440
A group of anthropologists were sent to
do some research and they found out was

218
00:14:44,441 --> 00:14:49,240
very interesting, uh, not rocket
science, but because the mothers,

219
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,270
the fathers weren't involved in this
process and they were the key decision

220
00:14:53,271 --> 00:14:54,104
makers.

221
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,970
So they actually wouldn't let the mothers
give this strange concoction to their

222
00:14:58,971 --> 00:15:00,230
child when they got sick.

223
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:04,700
So that's when the next battle started.

224
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:09,710
So we started training men, we
started training the fathers. So,

225
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:13,430
and this is just an example,
but there are other issues evolve.

226
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:18,560
The process was continuously modified and
which led to continuous improvement of

227
00:15:18,561 --> 00:15:20,520
the outcome itself.
So Brag,

228
00:15:20,521 --> 00:15:23,630
then worked with the Bangladeshi
government of course, uh,

229
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:27,350
to kind of scale up nationwide.
Uh,

230
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,440
it basically eventually went to every
single household in Bangladesh teaching

231
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:37,640
mothers how to make ort and um,
that's um,

232
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:43,010
uh, media advocacy campaign followed
to sustain the effect. Uh, eventually.

233
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:48,770
And just to kind of finish off
the story, um, I mean there, uh,

234
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:51,530
there was a long article
on this in New York,

235
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,760
New Yorker magazine a couple of years ago.
I'm just going to read a few coats,

236
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,073
um,

237
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:01,760
coaxing villagers to make the solution
with their own hands and explain the

238
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:06,170
messages in their own words while a
trainer observed and guided them at youth

239
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:11,060
far more than any public service ad or
instructional video could have done.

240
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:15,890
Over time the changes could be sustained
with television and radio and the

241
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:20,390
growth of demand led to the development
of a robust market for manufacturer oral

242
00:16:20,391 --> 00:16:24,080
rehydration salts three decades led later.

243
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:29,440
National surveys have found that almost
90% of children with severe diarrhea

244
00:16:29,871 --> 00:16:34,670
where given the solution child deaths
from diarrhea plummeted more than 80%

245
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:38,570
between 1980 and 2005.
Bangladesh.

246
00:16:38,571 --> 00:16:42,020
Now has the highest use
of working in the world.

247
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:47,120
So this is the quote I love and it's,

248
00:16:47,121 --> 00:16:51,350
I think it's relevant to a lot of
a lot of you who are in technology.

249
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:54,680
I mean we yearn for frictionless
technology solutions,

250
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:00,080
but people talking to people is still
the way norms and standards change.

251
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:05,350
Um, so there were some
early lessons in this, uh,

252
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:09,520
kind of just to kind of quickly summarize.
Um,

253
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:14,180
even in 30 years ago, I know data
is big now, but even 30 years ago,

254
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,370
data was king then at that time as well.

255
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:19,670
We constantly looked
at the numbers and uh,

256
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,950
evolved number two,

257
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:26,480
social innovation is not just
about a product innovation,

258
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,720
it's about a continuous process of
adjustment and tweaking as you go along.

259
00:17:32,391 --> 00:17:36,200
It's about process innovation as well.
And number three,

260
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:40,430
the simpler your solution is,
the easier it is to scale.

261
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,870
So it's very, very relevant to that.
Uh, the part of the world we operate in.

262
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:50,220
So fast forward about 30 years later.
Uh,

263
00:17:50,221 --> 00:17:54,840
so this is the second case story I'm
going to talk about. Uh, which was,

264
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:58,860
is more about when high
tech meets high touch.

265
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:04,950
Um, how do you get rural
women and men of course,

266
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:09,800
to trust and understand that mobile
money will improve their lives. Um,

267
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,940
just to set a set a context and there's a,

268
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:19,330
there's a story that, uh, you know,
our microfinance director, uh,

269
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:23,280
talks about that when we
introduced a mobile money to,

270
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:27,870
for our microfinance borrowers
to pay their loans on time. Um,

271
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,320
they would send the money mobile money
through their phone and then they would

272
00:18:31,321 --> 00:18:34,020
walk to our offices and come back,

273
00:18:34,021 --> 00:18:38,340
come and say that makes sure that
it actually has come through. And,

274
00:18:38,341 --> 00:18:41,730
um, because I think
that's, that's, you know,

275
00:18:41,731 --> 00:18:43,680
in a country where system often fails,

276
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:49,340
you always want that piece of paper with
a to make sure that this is your proof

277
00:18:49,351 --> 00:18:51,630
that you actually have done it.
You don't actually have trust,

278
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,750
a lot of trust in your system. So it, it,

279
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,910
it was actually quite interesting because
it do have them trust an SMS message

280
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:03,150
I've confirmation was
actually quite a large shift.

281
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,850
So,
um,

282
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:12,240
the idea idea for mobile money
came in from a different context.

283
00:19:12,241 --> 00:19:16,530
I mean, I think, uh, when 30
years they didn't like, you know,

284
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:20,190
in Bangladesh has become
a lot more urbanized,

285
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:25,020
is not as real anymore. Uh, also
people have become a lot more mobile.

286
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,360
They're traveling,

287
00:19:27,361 --> 00:19:32,361
they're seasonal migrants who are coming
back and forth from villages to cities.

288
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,850
They're working in the cities and
they're wanting to send their money as in

289
00:19:35,851 --> 00:19:37,080
money to their families.

290
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:41,850
So there was a big need of a safe,
reliable,

291
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,480
and affordable means of sending
money back home. Of course,

292
00:19:45,481 --> 00:19:49,800
people found very creative way of sending
money. They send it through the bus,

293
00:19:49,801 --> 00:19:50,940
overnight bus service.

294
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:55,941
They would send the money through post
office air through the selling airtime or

295
00:19:56,371 --> 00:19:59,400
physically carrying cash
form every human's. Uh,

296
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:03,810
but there was a big need of some something
which actually did it quickly and

297
00:20:03,811 --> 00:20:08,770
reliably. So that's where the solution
came in, which is the big cash,

298
00:20:08,771 --> 00:20:12,090
the mobile financial service.
Um,

299
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:16,070
inspired by the success in
east Africa with M Pesa. Um,

300
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,230
and some of the other companies
that work really well in Africa,

301
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:24,860
Brac bank started a be cash in 2011 with
the mission towards including the very

302
00:20:26,731 --> 00:20:29,370
bottom of the people on financially,

303
00:20:29,371 --> 00:20:32,790
which means that actually
not only just residents,

304
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:37,020
but the big vision is that introducing
financial products and services that

305
00:20:37,021 --> 00:20:40,640
works for the poor. So, um, it,

306
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:45,670
it was a great fit for Bangladesh
because in Bangladesh we have 90% of the

307
00:20:45,751 --> 00:20:50,500
household which has mobile phone,
but only 30% has bank accounts.

308
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:55,330
So if you can give people
with a phone bank account,

309
00:20:55,790 --> 00:21:00,690
it should work wonders. Um, but
the problem was, I mean, just to,

310
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:03,280
of,
so before I get into the problem a bit,

311
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,740
just to give you an understanding
of how the solution worked. Um,

312
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,480
it's not just a mobile to mobile money.
It's a,

313
00:21:10,481 --> 00:21:13,450
there's a role of an agent
network within the organization.

314
00:21:13,451 --> 00:21:17,650
The idea is that a rickshaw
puller say who works in the city,

315
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,200
wants to send money to his family,

316
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:25,440
would actually go to an agent who
would actually take the physical cash,

317
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:28,340
put it in his bank account, uh, mobile.

318
00:21:28,341 --> 00:21:33,341
And mobile money account and then the
have the money transferred to either

319
00:21:33,641 --> 00:21:35,320
directly to the,

320
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,330
to the family or to an agent
whose lives nearby, uh, to the,

321
00:21:40,331 --> 00:21:43,510
of the family member. And then
the family could use it. I mean,

322
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:48,511
if the money was transferred to
the bank account of the sender,

323
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:52,600
they could also use it for other
purposes as well, like, you know,

324
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:57,520
buying things directly. But we don't see,
we don't have the ecosystem yet quite,

325
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:01,150
quite ready. So one is mostly
being used for reference purposes.

326
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,880
So this is how it works.
Um,

327
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:08,940
but the problem was that then it
also went to 100 the delivery.

328
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:13,450
Everybody, nobody knew be cash,
right? Why would people trust be cash?

329
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:18,720
But everybody knew Brac
at that time and brags.

330
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:23,290
This is just our sort of operations
in terms of where we are,

331
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,990
um,
in terms of in the country itself.

332
00:22:25,991 --> 00:22:28,840
So we have a network
all across the country.

333
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:34,590
So what we started to build up with this
agent network and we worked with all

334
00:22:37,841 --> 00:22:41,290
these borrowers that we have
who actually owns stores.

335
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:46,450
So there are these small shop owners
who we went to and says that, you know,

336
00:22:46,451 --> 00:22:50,500
you know, the community community knows
you. Are you interested to be an agent?

337
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:55,570
And, uh, initially there was
like, not a lot of understanding,

338
00:22:55,571 --> 00:23:00,440
but people came along listening to us
because we thought we said this is going

339
00:23:00,441 --> 00:23:03,310
to work for you and this is gonna work
for everybody else in the community as

340
00:23:03,311 --> 00:23:04,121
well.
So,

341
00:23:04,121 --> 00:23:09,121
but 10,000 agents signed up initially
and once we did it and that's where the

342
00:23:10,721 --> 00:23:14,750
early adopters came in and then we
started working with the use user,

343
00:23:14,751 --> 00:23:16,690
growing the user base,
you're going forward.

344
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,650
And the rest is pretty much
history because I mean,

345
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:24,550
because she has seen a very, very rapid
expansion over the last five years.

346
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:28,540
Just to show you some numbers. I
mean, this is a slightly dated number,

347
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:33,250
but we now have, uh, it is now the largest
mobile financial service in terms of,

348
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:38,470
uh, how many people have a direct accounts
in the world right now where we have,

349
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,060
uh, about, uh,

350
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:45,120
close to in Bangladesh we have about 400
and so 41 million people with accounts

351
00:23:47,271 --> 00:23:50,750
and about 80% of them are
big cash account holders. Uh,

352
00:23:50,751 --> 00:23:53,570
you can see some of the numbers.
We, uh, the rapid growth,

353
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,600
I mean we have almost close to about
$50 million being transacted daily.

354
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,670
Um, and, um,

355
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:06,620
now the agent network boasts about
600,000 or around the country.

356
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,000
Um, just in, it all just
happened in just four years.

357
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,040
But I mean, we don't want to, we didn't
want to rest in this Laurel. However,

358
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:17,260
I mean,
because as I,

359
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:22,100
as I said that the primary mission was
to actually empower the poor financially.

360
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:27,550
So we looked at the numbers again and we
saw that there were far less women who

361
00:24:28,491 --> 00:24:30,890
signed up than men for
the big cash accounts.

362
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:36,050
And at the same time people were still
accessing it primarily as through the

363
00:24:36,051 --> 00:24:39,320
agent network,
not directly accessing themselves ran.

364
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,960
If you don't access it directly yourself,

365
00:24:41,961 --> 00:24:45,200
then financial products and
services built up for you,

366
00:24:45,201 --> 00:24:47,240
you're not going to actually
see a lot of benefit for it.

367
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:51,920
So I'm going to see a small video in terms
of how we took that as a next step in

368
00:24:51,921 --> 00:24:54,710
terms of increasing
the literacy for women.

369
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:59,300
And this will probably give you
a bit of a glimpse, uh, of, uh,

370
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,330
what we mean by this
high touch involvement.

371
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,850
Let's look at a two
minute video very quickly.

372
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:07,893
Hm.

373
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:38,610
Goodbye.
Like

374
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:13,993
Daca,
Daca

375
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,410
baggage with put them,
if they do end up with them,

376
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,023
she's

377
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,430
[inaudible]

378
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:36,790
she, she goes, you cannot

379
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,170
put a segment on Dixie money

380
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,080
leaves it at Bella

381
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:01,600
[inaudible].
I'm rolling shutter stock.

382
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:07,890
Oh,
by the banker.

383
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:13,080
[inaudible] and [inaudible]
I guess the DDC transfer,

384
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:22,210
the DC. Marsha, Marsha

385
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:28,530
[inaudible].

386
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:32,500
I seem to literacy biggest [inaudible]

387
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:41,030
right, okay. The dietitian
isn't montage. Tronic PC,

388
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:44,350
PC.
I'm a good data.

389
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:06,800
So the work is still
ongoing. I mean it's, uh,

390
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:11,420
I think the user experience needs to be
a lot better. So we are working on that.

391
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,620
Uh, but I think this, uh, there are
some key learnings, right? I mean,

392
00:28:15,621 --> 00:28:17,930
in both these two stories.
Uh,

393
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,130
so I think in,

394
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:25,550
in person to person interaction does
shift social norms and builds trust.

395
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,670
And for, for a lot of technology
adoption, adoption, um,

396
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:35,940
um, it's not just about
technology itself, right?

397
00:28:35,941 --> 00:28:38,710
It's about changing
mindsets. So it's, it's,

398
00:28:38,711 --> 00:28:42,140
it's very important to have that
person to person interaction.

399
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:45,410
And the secondly,
which is very relevant to the first one,

400
00:28:45,411 --> 00:28:49,490
that it's not just not the
product itself and not, no,

401
00:28:49,491 --> 00:28:54,170
it's not how we deliver technology
is actually as important,

402
00:28:54,171 --> 00:28:58,340
if not more than 10. The
technology itself. And, uh,

403
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:04,180
and the last one is that when
high tech meets high touch,

404
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:08,960
uh, the earlier days of
tech adoption actually is,

405
00:29:08,961 --> 00:29:13,070
is it really happens at that time.
And, and, and I think that's,

406
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,810
that's also where the magic happens.

407
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:19,900
I think Adam and I want to sort of
kind of end in that note that um,

408
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:26,450
it's,
I'm sitting in like 2017 right now.

409
00:29:26,451 --> 00:29:30,620
There are so many immense um,

410
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:35,390
sort of providence that has happened in
technology and about to come in the next

411
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:38,270
few years and we are looking at uh,

412
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:41,880
some amazing disruption can
happen in this market. Um,

413
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,360
you can think about,

414
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:48,390
I'm imagining these hundred thousand
health care promoters who are across the

415
00:29:48,611 --> 00:29:53,611
country having access to this tool
diagnostic tool who can go house to house,

416
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,010
collect data,
send data to the cloud,

417
00:29:57,011 --> 00:30:00,910
have AI engine looking
at it and give some, uh,

418
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:05,410
diagnostic ideas and linked them
to specialist solar on the world.

419
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:10,450
Amazing things can happen if we,
I'm thinking very focused,

420
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:13,930
customized specific product,

421
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:18,990
financial product being delivered to
various groups all around the country

422
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,430
because you have access to the data
because you're sitting on a huge data gold

423
00:30:23,431 --> 00:30:27,730
mine. Look, understanding when
people send money, what people's,

424
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:31,090
what we'll do with the money,
you can actually come up with very,

425
00:30:31,091 --> 00:30:34,090
very useful products in the coming days.

426
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:39,400
You can look at the jobs market,
informal formal book,

427
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:44,700
how you can make matches so that you can
increase the wages for the people who

428
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:48,460
don't have access to
those key information. So,

429
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:51,190
so amazing things can happen
in the coming days. I mean,

430
00:30:51,191 --> 00:30:54,070
I just want to sort of think that,
you know,

431
00:30:54,071 --> 00:30:58,970
if Google will all its resources,
martyr engineers that are,

432
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,940
you guys are all out here,

433
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:06,420
you can partner with some of the small
sophisticated distribution network that

434
00:31:06,521 --> 00:31:07,530
we have at Brac.

435
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:11,260
Real magic can happen in the coming
days and real disruption can happen.

436
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:14,830
And personally speaking,
over the last few years

437
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,860
as I have learned to have bigger dreams,

It's a chaotic country,

443
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:40,480
