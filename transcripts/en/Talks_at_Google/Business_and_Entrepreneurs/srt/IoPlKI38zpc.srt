00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,190
Good afternoon. Google. Good. Good.

personal branding and negotiation.

We are really, really glad to
have an esteemed panel here.

5
00:00:20,941 --> 00:00:22,890
I'm going to quickly introduce this,

6
00:00:22,891 --> 00:00:25,260
even those also cosponsored
by the women at Google.

7
00:00:25,261 --> 00:00:29,190
We've been trying to get this
audience for a long time,

8
00:00:29,191 --> 00:00:31,260
so thank you so much for making it here.

9
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:34,410
A quick introduction on all of them.

10
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:39,650
So luxury right next to me is

American Indian Foundation in Aif.

14
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:55,440
She founded the FS
digital equalizer program,

15
00:00:55,441 --> 00:00:59,610
which offers technology education to
80,000 children and 20,000 school teachers

16
00:00:59,611 --> 00:01:01,380
here in India.
Uh,

17
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:06,120
I don't know how many of you remember
the massive dead that happened in 2009 in

18
00:01:06,121 --> 00:01:08,280
my soul in the Infosys campus.
Uh,

19
00:01:08,281 --> 00:01:12,600
she actually brought Ted to India
and also some of the wonderful talks.

20
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:16,350
I know Sunita oppressions talk product
mysteries talk was very, very popular.

21
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,580
They with a partner as well and she's
been responsible pro all the talks and

22
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:23,960
storytelling that some of these
esteemed speakers have done. Uh,

23
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:28,260
sh she claims that one of our favorite
interviews, and I heard it last week was,

24
00:01:28,261 --> 00:01:33,240
is the one with Andy Grove who was the
co founder for a co founder of Intel.

25
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,780
So welcome flux me.
Thank you.

26
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:41,130
We have our next [inaudible].

27
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:46,050
So [inaudible] is a name
well known in Hyderabad. Uh,

28
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:51,070
she's the COO of mapped my genome and an
alumnus of [inaudible] as well as an ms

29
00:01:51,141 --> 00:01:52,800
from University of Illinois.
Uh,

30
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:56,450
I have read some of articles
in Linkedin and what really,

31
00:01:56,451 --> 00:02:00,800
really amazed me is a poem that
she's written on cancer mutation with

32
00:02:00,801 --> 00:02:04,970
chromosomal combinations. So people don't
think that art and science go together,

33
00:02:04,971 --> 00:02:07,640
but she's a living example
of art and science together.

34
00:02:07,641 --> 00:02:10,680
So great storytelling
and writing is a forte.

35
00:02:10,681 --> 00:02:12,470
She'll talk a little bit about it as well.

36
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,640
And she has several feathers in a cap
being named as one of the youngest global

37
00:02:16,641 --> 00:02:18,710
leaders by the World Economic Forum.

38
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:24,190
[inaudible]

39
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,050
oh, so we have reduced Tanisha. So next,

40
00:02:27,051 --> 00:02:32,051
she's a founder of a health and weight
loss coaching tech startup called Obino.

41
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:37,420
It's a 4.5 star rated app
on Google play and uh,

42
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:39,440
so you should definitely
go and check it out.

43
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:45,310
She's had an illustrious career spanning
from radio where she had content for FM

44
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,390
93.5.

45
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:52,700
She's also led brand for about the hotel
and there's now an entrepreneur welcome

46
00:02:52,701 --> 00:02:53,534
to too

47
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:57,760
[inaudible]

48
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:02,130
and I don't know why he
did needs introduction, but
I'll still do the honors.

49
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:10,250
Good on the global campaign operations,
which is now spread across 15 countries.

50
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:10,911
Uh,

51
00:03:10,911 --> 00:03:14,750
he's been the Google for the past 10 years
and leads a team of digital marketing

52
00:03:14,751 --> 00:03:19,520
professionals and engineers focusing
on ensuring that clients marketing

53
00:03:19,521 --> 00:03:24,320
objectives are met with the right product
expertise. So thank you for being here.

54
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:25,763
Thank you.

55
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,120
We've stopped the introduction,
the Google Vr with a fun fact.

56
00:03:32,121 --> 00:03:34,160
So we usually do this in Google.

57
00:03:34,161 --> 00:03:39,080
So we'd like to hear one less known or
a fun fact from each, a few Lakshmi.

58
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:43,660
Um, God, everything about me,

59
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:48,430
I lay my life on my sleeves. I
don't know what about me. Um,

60
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,440
I used to act in theater.

61
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,920
I did my MBA with a minor in theater and
I taught that that would work it in 10

62
00:03:54,921 --> 00:03:58,210
for two years, save enough money and
moved to La and become an actress.

63
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:03,250
But I fell in love with technology
and kept thinking, okay, next year,

64
00:04:03,251 --> 00:04:08,130
next year, next year, and then
realized at 28 that I'm too old. So

65
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:10,853
that's good.

66
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,990
Um, so I think that was one. So, Oh God,

67
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:21,640
by the police. I feel wondering
why we were in graduate school.

68
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,230
Love it.
The uh,

69
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,190
organizing fully and we messed
up a brand new dance load, so

70
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:32,100
I won't, I'll tell the whole
story at some other point.

71
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:37,780
One for someone who runs a weight loss
coaching startup you and hopefully it

72
00:04:37,781 --> 00:04:42,100
doesn't show, when you look at me,
I can out eat anyone in this room.

73
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,040
So when I got the mattered
and we went on our honeymoon,

74
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:48,620
my husband who had not
seen my true colors chill,

75
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,790
you belonged to want to botch up.

76
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:54,070
And Carola and my dad had organized
my favorite dinner for me,

77
00:04:54,071 --> 00:04:56,840
which was like this huge
heaping mound of Kettler.

78
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,830
Horizon three big different
abuzz of various fish.

79
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:01,750
Corinne's and my husband watched

80
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,910
quantified fascination.
I proceeded to eat

81
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,420
something that is like not good.

82
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,680
Don't do you want to approach it?

83
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,363
I do too.

84
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,350
Anything is left off my [inaudible]
sorry.

85
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,130
You think I have um, uh, given a doll.

86
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,970
So maybe one continuing on
the universities for this,

87
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:32,650
I was detained for a few hours in a police
station and it was not as trivial as

88
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,090
messing up with a dance floor.
It does a little more serious than that,

89
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,470
but I didn't live it.
I bet.

90
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,030
So. Okay. So moving on door,

91
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,930
Boston running on one started,

92
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,790
I know you started in a regular it and
then went to do a data analyst job,

93
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:58,940
but now you a strong brand for yourself,

94
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:03,500
probably the most recognized brand in the
field of genetic research in India. Um,

95
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:08,240
so how did you evolve your personal
branding one and then how do you tie it to

96
00:06:08,241 --> 00:06:12,950
the organization that you lead now?
And I know that you write a lot,

97
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:17,190
so how does that help with
building the site and, sure.

98
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,860
So I think in the Indian,
yeah,

99
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:22,970
I believe that any brand,
whether it's a personal loan or a company,

100
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,310
is when you are authentic
and true to yourself.

101
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:30,050
So I think what I've done all my
life is just to figure out who I am.

102
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:34,100
And uh, so part of our identity as
mapped my genome is also noise itself.

103
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,760
But it was through a
process of understanding and
discovering myself that I

104
00:06:37,761 --> 00:06:41,720
think I evolved in the beginning.
I would say when we started or Simone,

105
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:43,010
which was my first startup,

106
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,630
it was primarily to see how do you build
the business up in us in an area that

107
00:06:47,631 --> 00:06:51,470
we don't know anything about.
So part of it was building connections,

108
00:06:51,471 --> 00:06:55,250
building relationships, uh, without
expecting something from them.

109
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,920
And I think I started looking
on that in the beginning,

110
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:01,490
but over a period of time, I think
it, it sort of evolved. I start,

111
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,580
you start doing what you really
enjoy most, which is actually saying,

112
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:08,980
what do you get? You know, what do you
like about that particular relationship?

113
00:07:08,981 --> 00:07:11,650
So when it was a personal relationship,
it was very clear what,

114
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,390
what would be expected.
But building relationships on,

115
00:07:14,391 --> 00:07:17,420
they'd say linkedin or social
media was a very different thing.

116
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,400
So what a period of time.
I think that the world,

117
00:07:19,401 --> 00:07:23,010
and I also am a very quirky
and a very strange, you know,

118
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:26,870
I have my own strange habits, but
I started picking on that. Right?

119
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,890
So you say you're, if you're going to, I
used to write limericks even in school,

120
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:34,490
uh, but I use that as a process
of understanding new subjects.

121
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,610
So science was one of the
first things when we started,

122
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:41,480
we bought a company in the U S I was
trying to explore something in order to

123
00:07:41,481 --> 00:07:45,660
summarize, I would start writing. So
part of it was just being myself, uh,

124
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:50,450
but you know, just expressing. And
I think as we started growing and,

125
00:07:50,451 --> 00:07:52,460
uh,
it started a divorce.

126
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:57,350
And so I've never really planned
to build a story around it,

127
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,340
but I think it was just
being who I happened and,

128
00:08:00,341 --> 00:08:02,950
and I think it's continue to do that.
So I think this,

129
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,300
just that now that you've been doing it,
so many times,

130
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:08,270
people start seeing patterns in
it. So that's, that's about it.

131
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,740
But I think in the end it was just me.

132
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,780
[inaudible] you said, oh, Noi yourself.

133
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:16,850
And I know the two you
speak a lot about uh, uh,

134
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:19,100
your health transformation story,
uh,

135
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:22,500
from being an j to really being an
entrepreneur of a health startup.

136
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:27,820
And Donna's point of knowing your self
view while the spoken about how brand

137
00:08:27,821 --> 00:08:31,730
should be a reflection of
your value system. Do you
want to talk about that? So,

138
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,050
um, when I was part of the
brand team at et and uh,

139
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:40,410
we actually delve really deep into what
a brand is and in the most simple manner

140
00:08:40,411 --> 00:08:41,460
that you can break it down.

141
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:46,310
A brand is a series of associations
that people have off you.

142
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:49,380
They may be visual,
they maybe be process based,

143
00:08:49,381 --> 00:08:53,040
but they associate you with a
certain set of characteristics.

144
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,800
And that's how personal brands a built.
And I think

145
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:00,570
when she said, know yourself, she
really put her finger on it because, um,

146
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,450
when you build yourself as a
brand and as an entrepreneur,

147
00:09:03,451 --> 00:09:06,840
you have to do that everyday because
of the early stages. Investors,

148
00:09:06,841 --> 00:09:10,620
customers invest on the phone.
Do they trust the founder? Did.

149
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:14,490
There is no company that is hardly any
team that are placing their bets on you

150
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,450
and it is that intangible quality,
which is your personal brand,

151
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,820
which actually leads to that investment,

152
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:24,570
whether it's off a smaller ticket size
as a customer or as a large ticket size

153
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,703
as an investor.

154
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:30,960
And what I realized is you may want to
come across in your personal brand as

155
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:33,780
sophisticated urbane and witty,

156
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:38,790
but you may actually be that person who
can sit and have four portfolios of fish

157
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:43,470
courier to go and you should celebrate
that because that is what makes you

158
00:09:43,471 --> 00:09:47,460
unique. That is what makes you stand
out in a cluttered marketplace.

159
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,490
So I'm a decently dressed today,

160
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,950
but I have a data blue sense of fashion.

161
00:09:52,951 --> 00:09:56,850
My own husband cringes at mine dressing
choices and I've always been like that.

162
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,800
I've been that way since my college days.

163
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:04,160
But for me and for my investors that's
come to stand for how little the regular

164
00:10:05,011 --> 00:10:08,520
pursuits off looking good
and vanity mean to be.

165
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,500
And that says something about who I am.

166
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,140
You may not be something that
they aspire to or understand,

167
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,040
but it makes me very clearly
identifiable as a kind of person.

168
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,950
And that's what we should do.
We should look at what's core to us,

169
00:10:19,951 --> 00:10:23,920
not stuff that we really like about
ourselves, but which we really are.

170
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,090
Take that, spin it and make it work
for you. Perfect. So you said, yeah,

171
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,400
so you need to do,
you brought a very good point.

172
00:10:32,401 --> 00:10:36,390
It is like what you are the cord
and celebrity also. So those are,

173
00:10:36,391 --> 00:10:39,120
I think fundamentals on
what we base our brand.

174
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:43,950
So moving to something which is close
to all of the Google is working on a

175
00:10:43,951 --> 00:10:46,740
remote office and that often comes up.

176
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:51,210
We've heard a lot of infighting
branding stories from outside of Google,

177
00:10:51,211 --> 00:10:53,970
but close to home. What's the
magic mantra? And Google for it,

178
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:58,500
especially growing businesses from
a remote location and letting the

179
00:10:58,501 --> 00:11:01,980
headquarters know that this is the brand
of India. How, how to do it. I'll do

180
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:05,450
go about it. Yeah. And I, you know,

181
00:11:05,451 --> 00:11:09,020
my answer wouldn't be like as much of
a talk through strategy because when we

182
00:11:09,021 --> 00:11:13,130
started we never really taught
that this is what we will achieve.

183
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,640
But I think it was a lot
around, um, uh, you know,

184
00:11:16,641 --> 00:11:20,660
taking in a lot of the opportunities that
came in the way. But a few things that,

185
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,651
uh,
you know,

186
00:11:21,651 --> 00:11:25,940
we need to be aware when you are dealing
with a remote location and especially

187
00:11:25,941 --> 00:11:30,380
Google being a very headquarter
centric company, uh, anyone,

188
00:11:30,381 --> 00:11:31,820
and this is not just from India,

189
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:36,350
but maybe in a dub in Dublin or in
Singapore or anywhere, anywhere else,

190
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:41,030
dependability factor has to
be very high. Uh, so, uh,

191
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:45,830
the company is trusting the region or
the operations with someone who needs to

192
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:48,200
be very dependable,
a aligned,

193
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:53,240
understand the signals and uh,
react or act fast.

194
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:56,560
Right? Uh, so that's one
and I think over the PDL,

195
00:11:56,561 --> 00:12:01,450
and these are things which might
sound as I have a, uh, um, uh,

196
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:05,430
sounding a bit wise, but it's
all looking backwards. Um, uh,

197
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:10,420
what I understood from my, um,
you know, from others, you know,

198
00:12:10,421 --> 00:12:14,520
we have this fantastic Google guys
feedback and all that is a few things that

199
00:12:14,521 --> 00:12:19,510
have stood out for me is a dependable,
perseverant and I'm grounded.

200
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:24,160
I think these are some of the things, and
you know, again, back to the point, uh,

201
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:28,570
you know, that our new raised was,
you know, be what you are. Uh,

202
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:29,920
you know,

203
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,240
many times at Google we
have seen different kind of
leadership and we ask buyer

204
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,210
to or get inspired by
certain kinds of leadership.

205
00:12:37,211 --> 00:12:40,360
But what I have reconciled
pretty early is be what you are.

206
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:45,760
And these are the traits that define me
and these are the traits that perhaps

207
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,340
helped me function in a global set up,
much effective.

208
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:52,280
And, and that's fair because everybody
has their own strengths and areas for

209
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:52,981
development.

210
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:56,400
And really playing to your strength and
being authentic is probably the way to

211
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:59,790
go. Uh, you also spoke about
reliability and being disciplined,

212
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:02,480
which I think is a score of
walking the Moto Mod authors.

213
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:05,190
So we'll talk a little more about it,

214
00:13:05,191 --> 00:13:07,580
but back to luxury and luxury,

215
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:12,590
you worked with brand on people and
especially storytelling and you self

216
00:13:12,661 --> 00:13:14,580
described yourself as a people collectors.

217
00:13:14,581 --> 00:13:19,260
We all would like to know what does the
tone people collective bead and how do

218
00:13:19,261 --> 00:13:21,720
you associate a personal
brand with storytelling?

219
00:13:21,721 --> 00:13:25,460
Because that's the key to really
opposite of that. You know, we, you know,

220
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:28,530
one of the things I love doing is working
with people on telling their stories

221
00:13:28,531 --> 00:13:30,900
and uh, as everybody said, you know,

222
00:13:30,901 --> 00:13:35,580
you want in the conversations to look
for what makes them them, you know,

223
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:39,390
and you want to keep that because it's
not about making them all sound great.

224
00:13:39,391 --> 00:13:39,490
Great.

225
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:43,750
It's about making them all sound like
themselves and be comfortable with it. Um,

226
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,330
so that is one thing I learned and it,
you know,

227
00:13:46,331 --> 00:13:50,380
and actually I learned so much about
what I do in my theater than I did in my

228
00:13:50,381 --> 00:13:51,214
Mbas.

229
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:55,390
So one of the things they teach you in
theater is called playing the opposite,

230
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:59,830
you know, so it's sort of, if
you're really angry, you know,

231
00:13:59,831 --> 00:14:03,610
you yell and scream,
it's one level of being angry.

232
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,730
But if you're really like quiet
and then you say, you know what,

233
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:11,170
I want to kill you tomorrow. It's
like, it's more scary, you know?

234
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:16,420
So I've really learned that
because it's sort of as a person,

235
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:20,050
especially when I went to Portland,
Oregon where 92% white people,

236
00:14:20,051 --> 00:14:22,270
and here I am like this
little brown thing.

237
00:14:22,271 --> 00:14:25,610
I was the only Indian in like the entire,
uh,

238
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:28,420
my professors have ever
worked with I think.

239
00:14:28,421 --> 00:14:31,510
And they can place me because here I
am doing MBA when I do my theater and

240
00:14:31,511 --> 00:14:34,930
creative writing and they thought
Indians were like very meek and quiet.

241
00:14:34,931 --> 00:14:38,650
And here I was like not quite
making the and all that stuff.

242
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,670
So I'm like playing, you know, so
it took me a while to figure it out.

243
00:14:42,671 --> 00:14:46,390
But I think playing the opposites, that
is an amazing way of building your brand,

244
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:51,500
not playing, but you are multiple
things and it's okay to be things.

245
00:14:51,501 --> 00:14:52,400
I may wear

246
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:57,750
a sari and I might swear I'm aware a
very western outfit and be completely

247
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,533
traditional.

248
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:04,630
So we sometimes often confuse what
we try to be with what we are.

249
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,330
And I think it's okay to be opposite.

250
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,830
And then I'll open it to all four of you.

251
00:15:11,831 --> 00:15:16,780
Can you give me an example of where
this personal branding and authenticity,

252
00:15:16,781 --> 00:15:20,380
like all of you talked about really
has helped you in your career?

253
00:15:20,381 --> 00:15:24,460
That one point where you said, no,
I'm going to completely shun my,

254
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:28,120
what I'm pretending and being from
my normal and this is what I am.

255
00:15:28,121 --> 00:15:33,070
This is my brand. And it worked
for you. Do you have examples?

256
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:40,000
So I take a shot at it. Um, so when I,

257
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,360
when we raised our first
round of funding sec,

258
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,050
actually third round of funding from
roundglass partners that are us based

259
00:15:46,051 --> 00:15:49,600
health care. We see, uh,
we got APPS, actually,

260
00:15:49,601 --> 00:15:51,910
we've got about seven minutes
with the founder of the fund.

261
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:55,660
And we drove all the way across
town of whole Phalange of us.

262
00:15:55,661 --> 00:15:59,680
And they were like 30 of them and if
we're all expecting to make up page,

263
00:15:59,681 --> 00:16:03,520
and he just walked and he said,
why don't we take a walk? And I,

264
00:16:03,521 --> 00:16:07,600
my entire team was holding their Max and
their presentations and we just took a

265
00:16:07,601 --> 00:16:11,890
walk. And in that five minutes he said,
tell me a story. So for the second,

266
00:16:11,891 --> 00:16:12,431
I was lost.

267
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:15,580
I had the entire 10 slide pitch deck
and how much money I wanted to raise.

268
00:16:15,581 --> 00:16:16,720
And he's like,
tell me your story.

269
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:22,470
And I just told him my story of coming
down from 75 kilos back to 50 kilos and

270
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,410
why I felt this was something that I
could do for the rest of my life because

271
00:16:26,411 --> 00:16:29,970
I'd been through a really shitty phase
in my life and I wanted to make sure that

272
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,150
people didn't have it that shitty.

273
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:35,200
He gave me like exactly seven minutes
at the end of it, he says, create,

274
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:39,940
what are we signing the
papers? Uh, I didn't,

275
00:16:39,941 --> 00:16:41,140
I really didn't have an answer.

276
00:16:41,141 --> 00:16:45,190
And I think at moments like that when
you don't have a chance to prepare,

277
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,300
when you're expecting something to happen
in something totally different happens,

278
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,080
you are what you are because there's
nothing else you've prepared to be.

279
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:58,090
And that is the truest reflection of who
you are and people who can see that and

280
00:16:58,091 --> 00:17:00,010
judge it and what would
be part of that journey.

281
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,050
I think they're very lucky
to find those people.

282
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,220
And that Prince of good point too,

283
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,570
because it was also about self realization
because it's very important that all

284
00:17:07,571 --> 00:17:10,630
of us understand what we stand for.

285
00:17:10,631 --> 00:17:13,720
And it's important for us not
to pretend to be what we are.

286
00:17:13,721 --> 00:17:17,440
And that realization often we don't spend
enough time introspecting and figuring

287
00:17:17,441 --> 00:17:21,370
out what are we, what is our
strength? Right. Um, so, um,

288
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:27,160
I know you spoke about a means to an
end because you spoke about, okay,

289
00:17:27,161 --> 00:17:29,650
personal branding is the end,
but there is a way you,

290
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:32,350
you're writing has helped
to get to that end.

291
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:36,850
What are some of the other things that
you have used or tools that you've used

292
00:17:36,851 --> 00:17:39,790
or processes we've used to
really get clear end goal?

293
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,521
I think,
you know,

294
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:47,521
for me the last 16 years at least has
been primarily about my two startups.

295
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,160
Uh,
I also

296
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,640
have two babies, but that you don't
grow the babies now. Uh, but, uh,

297
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,490
I think for me it was always
about saying, you know, you are,

298
00:17:57,491 --> 00:18:01,200
you're very encrusted the business,
but you were more in grocery chain.

299
00:18:01,201 --> 00:18:04,470
How do you build a team and so on.
Right? So part of it was building that,

300
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:08,460
that culture, and it's strange
because you use, don't realize it,

301
00:18:08,461 --> 00:18:11,580
but it's sort of half has an effect on
the rest of the people that you have

302
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:16,320
around you. And a, so I was
primarily busy and creating that,

303
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:20,690
uh, and not trying to
put on any, you know,

304
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:25,700
a different shades to myself and just
being who I am when I interview people,

305
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,251
you know,

306
00:18:26,251 --> 00:18:31,251
you interviewed them as normal people and
not have the same set of questions and

307
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,101
those kinds of things.

308
00:18:32,101 --> 00:18:36,210
So I think part of your identity sort
of them sort of builds over to the

309
00:18:36,211 --> 00:18:37,044
business as well.

310
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:40,830
And whether it is mapped my genome where
currently I think we have some billion

311
00:18:40,831 --> 00:18:41,890
people also,
you know,

312
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:45,960
as part of the team and all of that I
think comes in because you truly want

313
00:18:45,961 --> 00:18:49,850
people to, to become, you know,
to create something that you,

314
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:53,010
you wish you can transform the
world and to be able to do that.

315
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,880
And I think part of that has to
do with how you are as, as I know,

316
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,120
and as long as you are
open to being a saying,

317
00:19:00,121 --> 00:19:02,940
I do know I could be completely
exposed and still you are,

318
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:06,300
people will want to work for me. I
think, you know, that's when you,

319
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:08,260
I think if you can build a good team,
right?

320
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:13,230
So I think you need to be honest with
yourself and you need to be open and

321
00:19:13,231 --> 00:19:15,450
transparent.
And I think the moment you do that,

322
00:19:15,451 --> 00:19:17,790
I think part of your
brand builds around that.

323
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:22,020
And a lot of that reflection I see near
writing because I think you've used that

324
00:19:22,021 --> 00:19:25,230
as a means to really convey your branding.
And so I,

325
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:29,130
I mean now I've started writing, now I'm
not nurses. So for instance, you know,

326
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:33,630
I've have political views,
I'll have uh, views on science.

327
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:37,920
I have used on, you know, feminism, I'll
have used a lot of different things. Uh,

328
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:43,130
initially I used to be an instigator so
I would love to get five people together

329
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,600
at Torrisi purchase like though and get
people to start talking because when we

330
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:50,550
are in that heated moment,

331
00:19:50,551 --> 00:19:53,460
especially when it comes to things
like politics or cricket or you know,

332
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,950
whatever it is that people
have polarizing views on,

333
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:01,200
I think all you need is a little later
on I realized that, you know, my job was,

334
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:01,441
you know,

335
00:20:01,441 --> 00:20:06,300
it's fun to be an instigator but it's
probably more fun if you can actually put

336
00:20:06,301 --> 00:20:10,620
some of your, what you really think
about something but do it in a non, uh,

337
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:15,610
not a way to really get people to start
fighting with each other and understand

338
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:19,380
him. How do you come up with something
creative and, and uh, you know,

339
00:20:19,381 --> 00:20:22,260
something that we can all start
thinking positively about. Right?

340
00:20:22,261 --> 00:20:24,870
So I think I have gone through a lot
of transformation in my own life.

341
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,960
So your by writing, so also sort
of reflect that. So you know,

342
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,370
I've written a book on poetry,

343
00:20:29,371 --> 00:20:34,371
but if I read through what I wrote
in 2010 versus what I liked in 2016,

344
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,440
I think that shows the transformation
of who, what I have become.

345
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,450
And you don't realize it at that point.

346
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:43,080
But part of it is that one of
the things is that when I write,

347
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:47,350
I could always go back and see how was
I as a person at that point. Right.

348
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:51,550
And then you can verify it with other
people who were there around because you

349
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:52,690
might not be the best judge.

350
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:56,230
So I think I've gone through some of
that phases that you're seeing. Do you,

351
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,860
what do you enjoy people fighting around
you and doing that installation versus

352
00:20:59,861 --> 00:21:03,040
saying, fine, let's say everything
is wrong in the universe today.

353
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,400
How do you find the right things
in people to be able to say,

354
00:21:06,401 --> 00:21:07,430
can we build a better world?

355
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:12,220
So I think that's my transformation and
in terms of building the brand that we

356
00:21:12,221 --> 00:21:13,590
are building. Great. Okay.

357
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,630
Sorry. I was going to
say, I'd say one thing,

358
00:21:15,631 --> 00:21:19,320
because I worked in a big
company in Intel and Google,

359
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:23,840
I found the best lesson about
building who you are, uh,

360
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,260
from my boss because you know,

361
00:21:25,261 --> 00:21:28,790
in India you're taught that if someone
would come to me and say, Lakshmi,

362
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,550
you know, you're a great job doing that
out. Oh No, no, no, I didn't do it.

363
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:36,690
Like Sam's idea or like, you know, he
really helped me or you know, whatever.

364
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:37,861
So an Intel,

365
00:21:37,861 --> 00:21:40,740
we had something called ranking and
rating where all the bosses have to get

366
00:21:40,741 --> 00:21:44,550
together and then they have to fight
for which one of their people should get

367
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:47,310
better ranking.
So my boss came to me and said,

368
00:21:47,311 --> 00:21:50,490
you make it so difficult for me to
fight for you. Because anytime I say,

369
00:21:50,491 --> 00:21:53,700
look what luxury? Then they said, no, no,
she didn't do it. You know, Sam did it,

370
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,850
you know, whatever. So
she said, can you please,

371
00:21:56,851 --> 00:22:00,840
when someone gives you a compliment,
can you please say thank you and shut up,

372
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,370
you know, don't say anything else. Because
otherwise you're always this mater,

373
00:22:06,371 --> 00:22:10,410
you know, like, Oh wow, they're all
better than like suddenly you realize, oh,

374
00:22:10,411 --> 00:22:14,580
they all left me. And like, you know, I'm
sitting here being the martyr, you know?

375
00:22:14,581 --> 00:22:18,990
So I think especially women,
and maybe I'm generalizing to a lot,

376
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:22,860
Indian women have this whole martyr
syndrome of I have to be the one to take

377
00:22:22,861 --> 00:22:24,960
care of my in laws I have
to do and take care of kids.

378
00:22:24,961 --> 00:22:27,930
I'm the one who has to stay home too.
I'm the one who has to do everything. I,

379
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:31,080
we just get rid of the crap and you know,

380
00:22:31,081 --> 00:22:35,160
and so I always say there are three
things is that you need to show up because

381
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:38,220
unless you show up,
nothing will come your way.

382
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:42,300
Next thing you are to speak up or ask
for it. When I brought her to India,

383
00:22:42,301 --> 00:22:46,300
I went to Chris and I said, we should do
this. It was like, wow, okay. If it was,

384
00:22:46,301 --> 00:22:47,011
if I didn't ask,

385
00:22:47,011 --> 00:22:51,030
it's an not an idea that would have
come to him and then shut up. You know,

386
00:22:51,031 --> 00:22:54,870
we should know, show up, speak up, shut
up, we should know when to do what.

387
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:59,490
And we always do the wrong things at
the wrong time. So no one to show up,

388
00:22:59,491 --> 00:23:01,740
no one to speak up and know
when to shut up, you know?

389
00:23:01,741 --> 00:23:05,930
So I think that bills who
you are it, you know, and,

390
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:09,210
and the times when you speak up, everybody
may not like you, but that's okay.

391
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:11,670
The people who like you
will really stick with you.

392
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,850
The others don't matter anyway.
So you know, the three s

393
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:19,960
[inaudible]

394
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:25,580
take back the three s Beacopp uh,
funny shops pick up and shut up.

395
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:30,390
That's the great thing.
I need to reflecting on that.

396
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,670
Go ahead. Go ahead. It's
not just a good thing.

397
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,570
[inaudible] you know,

398
00:23:38,571 --> 00:23:41,150
typically in our middle class upbringing,

399
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:46,070
you're supposed to be always look up to
your elders, you know, treat everyone

400
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:49,050
with reverence and sometimes it
does just doesn't work. Yeah.

401
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:53,700
And my first brush was that coming
from a very middle class background,

402
00:23:53,701 --> 00:23:56,670
I was put into sales and that
to up not in the country,

403
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:01,950
but nobody will live in Luke up to you
unless you give a few expletives. Right.

404
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,280
Um, so, you know,

405
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:10,520
it was like a cultural shock and a
functional shock as well in sales.

406
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:15,270
And then you literally,
you have to show up to make yourself,

407
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,930
you have to speak up to ask for the money.
Yeah.

408
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:21,630
And then finally you have to shut up
once you've got the order because after

409
00:24:21,631 --> 00:24:23,770
that, if you start
justifying, then you are,

410
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,470
it's a good dog three months. Right.
Absolutely. Okay. Thank you for that.

411
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,580
Um, so I need to do, you also spoke
about consistency, reliability,

412
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:41,320
dependability for the brand
as a brand for the region. Uh,

413
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:43,410
how did it go about doing it?
Was it,

414
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:47,680
once you identify the dependability
is what Hydro Bot will stand for?

415
00:24:47,681 --> 00:24:52,430
How do you go about really building
that top of mind recall? Yeah,

416
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:53,283
I think,
um,

417
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,850
you know, you have to look
at it from, uh, you know,

418
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:59,630
and it has evolved over a period of time.

419
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:03,770
If I were to look at overall Google's
business or go global operations from

420
00:25:03,771 --> 00:25:07,670
India, I think initially when
we started off the operations,

421
00:25:07,671 --> 00:25:12,530
it was more like providing scale.
Um, viva growing crazy. Uh,

422
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:16,070
we just ran out of people in the bay area,
right?

423
00:25:16,071 --> 00:25:20,450
And I think that's how we came to India
and just to take care of the growth and

424
00:25:20,451 --> 00:25:24,290
the scale, but that can't be a
value proposition beyond the point.

425
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:29,090
And very soon we realized that and then
we started consolidating and looking as

426
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,640
what are we here for?

427
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:34,400
So it was a bit of a soul searching
after having expanded operations.

428
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:38,660
And that's where in I think the
realization happened that, you know,

429
00:25:38,661 --> 00:25:43,550
you need to be very clear of the value
that you're providing as an organization.

430
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,080
And over the period,

431
00:25:45,081 --> 00:25:50,081
I think we shifted it from just providing
resources and providing transactions

432
00:25:51,021 --> 00:25:56,021
and providing support to really pivoting
around expertise and what we uniquely

433
00:25:56,751 --> 00:26:00,740
bring for Google in India to India.
Right.

434
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,040
And I think the answer was
very evident for us, right?

435
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:08,210
Let's leave this amazing talent that's
available in country, in know country.

436
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:12,550
And Google is all about a
lot around analytical skills,

437
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,920
around data driven decisions.
And we have that in plenty.

438
00:26:15,921 --> 00:26:20,660
So if you have processes that effectively
leverage is this on top of it,

439
00:26:20,661 --> 00:26:25,040
the fabulous technical talent that we
have, we have a very winning proposition.

440
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:29,430
So I think that's been the journey and
whether you take whichever function, um,

441
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:33,460
you know, whether it is Gtech
or trust and safety, RSM, we,

442
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:36,740
we have been trying to leverage
that and get it to the maximum.

443
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:41,080
And that's a fair point because we
always tell the teams that your personal

444
00:26:41,081 --> 00:26:43,390
branding for stops with you individually,

445
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:46,920
then it goes to your team and then
it goes to the larger organization.

446
00:26:46,921 --> 00:26:50,530
So you consistently have to
build on all the three, uh,

447
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:55,550
some good point on that a little are you
keep talking about using digital media

448
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:01,100
consistently to check on your brand and
your individual brand as well as your

449
00:27:01,741 --> 00:27:06,480
organization's brand. And as a part
of my work and trust and safety,

450
00:27:06,481 --> 00:27:10,770
our team's constantly educate people
on leaving a digital footprint.

451
00:27:10,771 --> 00:27:14,610
What are you really leaving behind
when you're talking? Because we've had,

452
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:19,790
we educate kids in schools and we say
that you're leaving something on your

453
00:27:20,191 --> 00:27:25,110
Facebook or on your Google plus
account or anywhere linkedin and seven,

454
00:27:25,111 --> 00:27:26,250
eight years later,

455
00:27:26,251 --> 00:27:30,510
there is a recruiter who's doing a
background check on you and they find that

456
00:27:30,511 --> 00:27:35,340
you have very polarized political
view or very polarized individual, uh,

457
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,410
views. And then they say, oh,

458
00:27:37,411 --> 00:27:40,170
this is not going to match to
our organizational culture.

459
00:27:40,171 --> 00:27:44,610
So we really teach people on how they
shouldn't be leaving a digital footprint

460
00:27:44,611 --> 00:27:47,760
that does not work for them.
So how do you evaluate that?

461
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,890
So a couple of years ago,
um,

462
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:54,840
I actually came to the realization that
Facebook is the biggest brand building

463
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:57,570
tool available to you for
your personal branding space.

464
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:01,170
Every photograph you put out there,
every status update,

465
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:06,120
every comment on a colleague sort of
friends or a family member's post is

466
00:28:06,121 --> 00:28:07,240
sending view up,

467
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:11,040
sending the world a very clear view of
who you are and what you believe in.

468
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:16,440
We share stuff randomly. I, I
recently got an update from Facebook.

469
00:28:16,441 --> 00:28:19,080
They're in the last year. I've
shared some 9,000 things. I was like,

470
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:21,450
where do I get the time to do it?
But I've done it.

471
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:26,400
The problem is we don't realize that
there is now no boundary between your

472
00:28:26,401 --> 00:28:30,810
professional life and your personal life.
It is all one fluid,

473
00:28:30,811 --> 00:28:35,370
seamless hole and everybody
at all times is judging you.

474
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,650
So you know,
only the paranoid survive.

475
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:42,600
Anybody and everybody who is looking at
your life, whether it's your best friend,

476
00:28:42,601 --> 00:28:46,950
your spouse, your children,
your colleagues, your
workmates, your investors,

477
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,660
they are all watching you.

478
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:53,490
Do not think anything you put out there
is being ignored and therefore you have

479
00:28:53,491 --> 00:28:57,120
a duty to yourself to speak. Could,
you know, show up and speak up.

480
00:28:57,121 --> 00:28:59,130
But most importantly to shut up.

481
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,950
I think in personal branding
on the digital space,

482
00:29:01,951 --> 00:29:05,760
one of the strongest things that
you can do is stop yourself.

483
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:08,550
Stop yourself from sharing
that status update.

484
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:13,470
Stop yourself from sharing that
personal low that you're going through.

485
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,530
Stop yourself from
calling your husband out.

486
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:20,400
He has pissed you off because
the world is watching.

487
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,080
The moment you realize that the world is
watching and it will have repercussions,

488
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:29,640
you will automatically start controlling
what you put out there and controlling

489
00:29:29,641 --> 00:29:31,620
is the first aspect to building our brand.

490
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,060
That's a good point. It's a
luxury. Coming back to you,

491
00:29:35,061 --> 00:29:39,140
I know you worked with a lot of people
in the industry in building the brand and

492
00:29:39,141 --> 00:29:41,650
helping them make a story
and they're all low.

493
00:29:41,651 --> 00:29:46,390
Some of them are working in organizations,
some of them in Ngos. How do you feel,

494
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:50,830
what does the common story in terms
of building their brand for everyone?

495
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,470
You know,
as I said,

496
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:58,500
one of the things I always look for is
was what is it that makes them them?

497
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,570
You know, actually when we were
all kids, we were just perfect.

498
00:30:01,571 --> 00:30:02,590
We are just ourselves.

499
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:07,450
And then through the years you learn what
not to do and then we have this facade

500
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,730
of, you know, like for example
I'm sitting in this chair,

501
00:30:09,731 --> 00:30:12,460
I don't know if it's just like this that's
just like this, that's it. Like this.

502
00:30:12,461 --> 00:30:13,660
Which you know,
you're like,

503
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:17,560
your mind is wandering through 10
different things cause you want to look

504
00:30:17,561 --> 00:30:21,670
perfect and right. And what I try
to work with people on, you know,

505
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,960
be comfortable with your imperfections
because that's your greatest tool.

506
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:31,080
The point is that we focus on trying to
be perfect so much that we are not in

507
00:30:32,861 --> 00:30:37,510
love with who we are. And I think, you
know, in my conversations with people,

508
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,910
I try,
because it happens with everyone.

509
00:30:39,911 --> 00:30:43,240
You talk to them in our first
like there is this very,

510
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,190
this very focused,

511
00:30:45,191 --> 00:30:49,600
or I want to talk about the four ways
to blah or six ways to play or something

512
00:30:49,601 --> 00:30:52,420
like that. And then, you know,
you kind of get a little,

513
00:30:52,421 --> 00:30:55,480
get a little and then they suddenly
something gets where they become children

514
00:30:55,481 --> 00:30:57,160
when they're talking
about it. Oh, you know,

515
00:30:57,161 --> 00:31:01,210
but when we were building this product,
we did this and then we did that.

516
00:31:01,211 --> 00:31:03,280
And then you're like,
ah, that's what it is.

517
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:07,630
The place where you become
a child, you, you know,

518
00:31:07,631 --> 00:31:12,631
you don't care what you look like or how
you sound like that's who you are and

519
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:15,850
everyone has that.
You know,

520
00:31:15,851 --> 00:31:20,080
you just need to find that and bring that
out and say it's okay to be like this.

521
00:31:20,081 --> 00:31:23,080
Yes, I know you're this big
deed president or whatever.

522
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:28,081
But it's okay to be that here because
there are tenicity referring back to what

523
00:31:28,211 --> 00:31:30,970
you were saying. Um, it's most important.

524
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,570
And I also tell them there's another thing
I learned in theater is that like for

525
00:31:34,571 --> 00:31:37,360
example, if you're in a play,
you forget a line or something,

526
00:31:37,361 --> 00:31:40,240
you're just beating yourself over
the head, right? But you know what?

527
00:31:40,241 --> 00:31:44,890
The audience has no clue. Only you know
that you miss something. So I tell them,

528
00:31:44,891 --> 00:31:49,750
look what if you forget a
line or whatever. Nobody
knows. Nobody is judging you.

529
00:31:49,751 --> 00:31:53,350
You know, just be yourself. If you
forget something, just keep going.

530
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,480
And there's a lot we can fix
in editing, you know, so, so,

531
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,740
you know,
be,

532
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:04,030
so I think a lot of the story telling a
lot of the personal brand building is to

533
00:32:04,031 --> 00:32:09,031
find that those imperfections in you and
being extremely comfortable with them

534
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,860
and try not to be perfect
because a perfect person is
the most boring to watch.

535
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:19,960
Torquey totally agree.
I know moving to your wife,

536
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:23,530
I know a lot of the audience,
so what is about negotiation,

537
00:32:23,531 --> 00:32:27,230
because I think this is a tome we have
a lot of courses on negotiation and

538
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,460
people's life is all about negotiation
from Atkins to your organization,

539
00:32:30,461 --> 00:32:32,920
to your managers, to your peers.
You're always negotiating.

540
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:36,640
How did your negotiation involved in,

541
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,100
through your career and you've
spoken about something, uh, from

542
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,700
being a selfish negotiator
to a selfless negotiators.

543
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:47,010
Do you want to talk about that
suddenly? So one, uh, I'm a minority,

544
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:51,380
so it's in my DNA.
It's part of our upbringing.

545
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:56,560
But I thought maybe a couple of
stories that, uh, that, that sure.

546
00:32:56,561 --> 00:32:59,690
How I've transformed a
would be interesting. Uh,

547
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:04,640
when I graduated from a University
of Illinois in the graduate school,

548
00:33:04,641 --> 00:33:07,940
typically they didn't do campus placement,
but during our time, I think we got,

549
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:10,220
I got offers on the phone
and stuff like that,

550
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:12,170
but there was this one
that we got on campus.

551
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:17,350
It was a bank called First Chicago and
they sent a letter to three of us, um,

552
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:21,500
giving us a job. Right? So I don't
remember, it was like 30, $40,000 a year.

553
00:33:21,501 --> 00:33:23,880
I don't remember the exact figure.
But anyways,

554
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:27,380
so the HR sends me an email and you know,

555
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:31,400
the other two people accept.
I instantly responded back saying,

556
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:33,770
you have no idea who
you send this offer to.

557
00:33:33,771 --> 00:33:36,170
You have no understanding of my worth.
And it was,

558
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,430
I don't remember the exact words,

559
00:33:37,431 --> 00:33:40,820
but it was primarily saying that you
have no clue who you're talking to.

560
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:42,530
You better give me a better offer.
Right.

561
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:47,060
And within five minutes I get a call
back from HR. They were shocked.

562
00:33:47,061 --> 00:33:51,710
They were like, they never heard anyone
say something like this before. And,

563
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:56,120
uh, any, she called me and
said, you should never say
something like this, this,

564
00:33:56,121 --> 00:33:58,670
that, but by the way of my vice
president wants to meet you.

565
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:04,620
So I went the next day and they
increase my offer by $5,000, uh,

566
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:08,200
just because of that email. But
I didn't join them anyway, but,

567
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:14,720
but it was a, you know, when I think
back, I don't have that email. It was a,

568
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:19,430
it was that time of my life when I was
extremely arrogant. Um, and it was,

569
00:34:19,431 --> 00:34:21,690
it was my way of negotiating
at that point. And,

570
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:25,730
and I thought it was perfectly fine
over a period of time, I think, uh,

571
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:30,010
I continued to negotiate in every
form we take your Ip, you know,

572
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:34,850
but like one of my, uh, classmates in
the class on negotiation in Harvard did,

573
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:39,560
we all were kept in three d multiple
groups. When we came out, he said,

574
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:43,340
my God, I thought, you know, you will, I
got the best deal here when I come out.

575
00:34:43,341 --> 00:34:46,660
I find that I'm the most crude,
but you know,

576
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:51,530
but I think what I have evolved into
is to be able to say that if you really

577
00:34:51,531 --> 00:34:56,150
want to get the best outcomes,
it's more important to understand heart,

578
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,500
what it means to them also.

579
00:34:57,501 --> 00:35:01,700
So the best deals will be done if you
also understand what your open at once.

580
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:05,630
And I think that comes in with a very
open view of being able to do this.

581
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:10,340
I've also gone in the middle through
this phase where we had to deal with an

582
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:15,140
investor. We were acquiring a company
for which we are raising money. Um, they,

583
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,760
uh, it was a very, very tight timeline.
We were acquiring a public company.

584
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,460
There was a certain time
in which you could do it.

585
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:24,230
We had no money to otherwise buy it.

586
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:28,640
But the way we had to negotiate there was
to walk away and, and I, and we got it.

587
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,150
But today I think in most cases,
whether it's negotiating with an employee,

588
00:35:32,151 --> 00:35:36,020
whether it's negotiating with anybody,
I first tried to understand what the,

589
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,330
what it means to them. Um, and I
think once you understand them,

590
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:43,570
then I think it's easy to anchor and
to be able to get the right pieces in,

591
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:46,440
in together. So I think that
has shown that, you know,

592
00:35:46,441 --> 00:35:51,441
I've gone through the phases of life
where you started hard negotiation towards

593
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:54,990
being a, to be able to say, how do
you get the best out of everybody?

594
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:55,861
That's a good point.

595
00:35:55,861 --> 00:35:59,010
I know because a lot of time when you're
negotiating and you're thinking that

596
00:35:59,011 --> 00:36:03,150
they are, the arpanet always has an
opposing the requirement. They don't,

597
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:06,000
you probably talking different languages.
Would you want the same thing?

598
00:36:06,001 --> 00:36:08,160
So really sitting and talking,

599
00:36:08,161 --> 00:36:13,130
having a fair dialogue helps you really
achieve that. So a, and I would just,

600
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,940
uh,
during lunch discussing,

601
00:36:14,941 --> 00:36:18,600
there is a research done by a lady called
Linda [inaudible] who saw a third of

602
00:36:18,601 --> 00:36:23,520
women don't ask. And they
find that 7% of the women, uh,

603
00:36:23,521 --> 00:36:25,710
attempted to negotiate a new job offer,

604
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:30,770
whereas 57% of men always
negotiate a job offer.

605
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:35,070
So she did a little more research
on why women don't negotiate.

606
00:36:35,071 --> 00:36:39,810
And one of the things is women feel that
they suffer from a reputational risk

607
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:43,640
when the negotiate, how are they
perceived when they negotiate? So, uh,

608
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:47,520
what is your impression of this research?

609
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:53,910
This is not something that I'm
generally speaking about. Um,

610
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:58,080
we in our investor portfolio,
I'm one of the,

611
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,690
as my investor ports around
the most Chiney people.

612
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:05,160
So he basically tells me the first board
meeting we had, I remember he came,

613
00:37:05,161 --> 00:37:06,780
we had the whole session and then he said,

614
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:09,510
you know that all of the other portfolio
companies I've been telling them to

615
00:37:09,511 --> 00:37:13,710
reign in their spending
with you, I'm thinking, you
please step up your spending.

616
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:17,690
So I said, I will, but can you give me
some more money first? And he's like,

617
00:37:17,691 --> 00:37:18,810
I've already given you money.
I said,

618
00:37:18,811 --> 00:37:21,540
but I'm not comfortable spending
till I have more money in the bank.

619
00:37:21,541 --> 00:37:25,000
So you give me money, then I'll spend. So
they gave me money. See, I didn't know it.

620
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:28,860
He said, my God, you take asking for
money to a whole different level.

621
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,300
And that's when I told him, I said, I
learned this in my career the hard way.

622
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:37,710
Women negotiating two ways and they're
still distinct patterns of behavior.

623
00:37:37,711 --> 00:37:38,550
How we negotiate.

624
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:42,660
You negotiate a certain way when you
have something in your hand and you

625
00:37:42,661 --> 00:37:45,450
negotiate a different way when you
don't have something in your hand.

626
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:47,400
So if you have to job,
job offers,

627
00:37:47,401 --> 00:37:49,410
you see how you go and
negotiate with the new guy.

628
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:54,700
We full been [inaudible] not [inaudible],

629
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:00,750
you don't have a job offer.
So please not three there though.

630
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,910
And the one thing that you know,
my dad always told me,

631
00:38:03,911 --> 00:38:07,320
he's like always going like
you have another offer on
the table cause he doesn't

632
00:38:07,321 --> 00:38:10,620
know. You don't have another offer on
the table when you're going to say, Eh,

633
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:15,960
it's not happening. It's in Dev. We'll
say no. That's another thing women do.

634
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:18,300
Women either say yes or they say no.

635
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:22,610
A lot of successful negotiators
never seen no, there's,

636
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:27,000
you know, I think we can do better. You
know, let's work on this a little bit.

637
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:31,740
They will never say no. They
will never stop and walk
away. They were, in her case,

638
00:38:31,741 --> 00:38:36,070
it worked and you don't touch
wood, it works. But in most cases,

639
00:38:36,071 --> 00:38:39,910
if you just keep the interest alive and
keep pushing, keep pushing, keep pushing,

640
00:38:39,911 --> 00:38:41,190
you will eventually get to a what?

641
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,190
What's most importantly behave like
you have another offer in your hand.

642
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,170
They don't know any better. No, that's,

643
00:38:47,171 --> 00:38:51,460
that's a very fair point because you
always always have an option if not this,

644
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:54,730
you have an option.
Options always come and a yeah,

645
00:38:54,731 --> 00:38:58,390
we tend to say yes or no and we
need to get into the gray zone.

646
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:01,120
Why the men have a problem with asking.

647
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,390
I don't personally
suffer from that problem.

648
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:08,063
People listening,

649
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:14,320
it has that and the research also says
they associated with the reputational

650
00:39:14,321 --> 00:39:17,770
risk. Like they ass

651
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:21,050
asked too many times. You
call aggressive, you know,

652
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:25,300
I mean you have to deal
with labels and I think we,

653
00:39:25,301 --> 00:39:28,630
somewhere in the bottom of our hearts,
we all want to be liked by everybody.

654
00:39:28,631 --> 00:39:33,430
We don't want to be called. Yeah. Oh,
that aggressive or just very, very upset.

655
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:38,380
He said, Oh, you know, when
she's so sweet, she's so, we
want to hear those things.

656
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:41,350
Be a good girl. It'd be
a good girl. Yeah. So

657
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:48,130
like you want to be universally
like, I mean, mine is,

658
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:50,260
apple was always the
opposite problem to her.

659
00:39:50,261 --> 00:39:54,400
I'm like this completely useless teleco
man, you know, can ask for anything.

660
00:39:54,401 --> 00:39:57,460
So it's like, it's always like, oh yeah,
take care, take care of. They don't,

661
00:39:57,461 --> 00:40:00,570
it's like, I'll do it for free as a
show up. I mean, it's sort of like this,

662
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:02,950
and I learned this from somebody.

663
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:06,650
One speaker I was talking to to
come here and then he said, oh,

664
00:40:06,651 --> 00:40:07,870
I would love to come to India.

665
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:12,390
And it's the only thing is I need
$100,000 donation to my NGO only then I'll

666
00:40:12,391 --> 00:40:16,690
show up. I'm like, wow. Uh, it also,

667
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:19,710
but he was like, he's pretty good.
He said, it's not for me, but if I'm,

668
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:25,090
and he said something very interesting.
He said, if you want to say joy,

669
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:30,160
don't do anything for money, but if you
do something, you are, you get paid.

670
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:32,800
You know, it's sort of like
you don't need to do it for it,

671
00:40:32,801 --> 00:40:36,040
but somebody should value your time.

672
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:39,120
So I think I've learned that
now when someone asks, okay,

673
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,610
you donate something to our foundation,
then I'll come. It doesn't matter,

674
00:40:42,611 --> 00:40:47,350
they donate five rupees or 500,000 it
doesn't matter what you're doing and show

675
00:40:47,351 --> 00:40:49,350
me. And then I'll say, I'll tell
them that I was, you know what?

676
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:53,410
You think I'm worth it.
I'm watching kind of a thing.

677
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:56,770
But I think some of it
is finding the balance.

678
00:40:56,771 --> 00:40:59,680
If you're the one who's like,
you know,

679
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:04,600
who didn't have any fear or the rain and
if you're the one who was kind of very

680
00:41:04,601 --> 00:41:08,470
awkward asking, you should push yourself.
It's amazing what you get when you ask.

681
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:14,020
I am always amazed by it. I'm like,
Oh really? Okay. And that's fair.

682
00:41:14,021 --> 00:41:18,230
We should always be asking.
It gives a word to your dog.

683
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:22,210
And one more thing I want to say is the
thing I've always learned that helps me

684
00:41:22,211 --> 00:41:26,530
as a tactic. Pretend that you look
like everybody around in the room,

685
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,010
you know? So if I'm in with,
you know, especially at Intel,

686
00:41:30,011 --> 00:41:33,070
most of the things is
like 15 white guys and me.

687
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,550
And I think I look like a white guy.

688
00:41:34,551 --> 00:41:37,580
I mean I don't think I look
like anything different.

689
00:41:37,581 --> 00:41:41,120
And I think I talked like them and
then I move into a room off, you know,

690
00:41:41,121 --> 00:41:45,380
2015 year olds, I think I look
like them, talk like them.

691
00:41:45,381 --> 00:41:48,470
So you just have to think,
you look like them, you know,

692
00:41:48,471 --> 00:41:51,170
you don't look anything different.
You're not anything different.

693
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,400
That's a good tip.

694
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,880
Um, so I did, this was for you
because as a business leader,

695
00:41:55,881 --> 00:42:00,860
you've oftentime made offers to senior
leaders in your organization and both men

696
00:42:00,861 --> 00:42:05,390
and women. How many times have you seen
a woman actually come up and negotiate?

697
00:42:05,391 --> 00:42:07,510
You said any incident that sticks out and,

698
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,463
or

699
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:21,530
you wish we were hiring more woman because
then the opportunity for negotiation,

700
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:24,840
it's been one of my big objectives here,

701
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:29,340
but he does admit to that 57 versus 7%.

702
00:42:29,341 --> 00:42:31,920
I can't get me,
I can't remember the exact stats,

703
00:42:31,921 --> 00:42:36,921
but men usually nine out of 10 times
has ended up in a negotiation with this

704
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:41,250
thing and each one has their own style.
One will be like slamming the phone.

705
00:42:41,251 --> 00:42:45,720
I have also myself slamming the phone on
Google offer, so I completely resonate

706
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:48,140
working in north India

707
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:53,770
[inaudible]

708
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:57,860
but the, the, the person whom
whom I slammed and I respect her,

709
00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:01,340
she is currently the director
of HR director, Flipkart.

710
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:05,030
She was the head of recruitment and she
was equally aggressive so she didn't

711
00:43:05,031 --> 00:43:06,740
call back. And then I'm like, okay,

712
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:10,340
all right.
So,

713
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:12,490
but uh,
but usually

714
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:16,850
it's the case that, um, men
do negotiate a much, much,

715
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:21,190
much, much more. I, and, um,
I wish, I, I think, you know,

716
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,600
as I was saying that I think it's,
it comes to um,

717
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:29,630
this anxiety maybe or some
worry factor around, Ooh,

718
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:33,590
if I say no, what would
happen? Right, right.

719
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:38,510
Or would it be interpreted in some other
way? And that's something, you know,

720
00:43:38,511 --> 00:43:41,990
some of the fabulous women leaders
that I work with, you know,

721
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,630
they used to give it a dab. Yeah. Right.

722
00:43:44,631 --> 00:43:48,000
So I think that's the spirit
with which we meet too. Yeah.

723
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:51,920
You know, I, I just wanted to say
this one of, I have a very, very,

724
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:55,880
a very esteemed colleagues, the very
senior female leader, and she always says,

725
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:59,920
I'm not in this for the money.
And I saw disagree with,

726
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:04,040
I think women are a lot of times
you'll hear this from women a lot.

727
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:06,680
I'm not doing this for the money.
What are you doing it for?

728
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:11,180
Incident to passion and the
money. Oh, this consequence.

729
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:14,870
Yes. I think, I think you're wrong.
That's a great negotiation tactics.

730
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:20,270
[inaudible]

731
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:27,960
I'm not doing it for the money,
but give me what I want.

732
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:29,410
Yeah,

733
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:38,340
yeah. Don't smell bad. I want to say
it. You know, especially for women,

734
00:44:38,341 --> 00:44:40,980
I worked in the NGO sector,
corporate, everything.

735
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,710
It's very easy for them
to ask for somebody else,

736
00:44:43,711 --> 00:44:47,040
but it's very difficult for them to ask
for themselves. It's just something,

737
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:50,180
not some women, this is like a
psychiatric saying. My friends,

738
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:54,130
I do it all the time. You
know? It's so easy for me to
walk in and say, my friends,

739
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:58,110
any doctors, none is doing this, give
$1 million, and then I'll go in and say,

740
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:01,980
Oh yeah, my Saturday, it doesn't matter.
You know what I mean? It's sort of like,

741
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:06,300
but I think we have to get over this
thing of it's okay to ask for yourself,

742
00:45:06,301 --> 00:45:10,080
your, your health, your
money, what you need.

743
00:45:10,081 --> 00:45:12,120
There's nothing wrong and asking for it,
but it's a,

744
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:16,950
I still have a huge mental block to
it. I feel kind of odd, but I have to.

745
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:20,490
It's sort of like this you hate doing,
but you have to do it.

746
00:45:20,491 --> 00:45:22,380
It's sort of you pushed yourself.

747
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:26,970
That's one of the things I have
to push myself a lot. I mean,

748
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:31,160
people don't know me don't believe that.
But I do know one creeped up.

749
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:33,150
I think we got some really good tips.

750
00:45:33,151 --> 00:45:36,270
One is pink that you have
options when you're negotiating.

751
00:45:36,271 --> 00:45:40,860
So that gives you a lot more power to
negotiate, ask because we don't ask,

752
00:45:40,861 --> 00:45:42,240
you will never know what they're getting.

753
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:45,780
And Paul does believe in your value
because if you believe that you are

754
00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:49,150
vulnerable, the other person when
started believing that you're valuable.

755
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,060
So asked with that.

756
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:55,400
Can I just add one to that? And this is
a very Google centric view maybe. Uh,

757
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:59,260
and this is beyond salary. Yeah.
Yeah. Uh, it's, I think, uh,

758
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:03,190
in the business context and you know,
we are negotiating every day.

759
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:07,320
I think what has worked for
me a significantly is, uh,

760
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:11,080
and what I keep saying all our
leaders is where that one Google hat,

761
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:14,740
because, uh, today you are
representing this function.

762
00:46:14,741 --> 00:46:18,760
Tomorrow you're representing that
part of the business. But if you,

763
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:21,950
and I say that, that, you know,
step back and if you were familiar,

764
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:24,700
very few are so under what we'll do.
We did thinking about it.

765
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,650
And then suddenly it makes you open up
with a lot of possibilities and u s and

766
00:46:29,651 --> 00:46:33,460
that's where the new connect with
your opponent or your adversary,

767
00:46:33,461 --> 00:46:35,530
whatever objective you want to port.

768
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:39,160
But that's where in the meeting ground
kind of happens because many a time I

769
00:46:39,161 --> 00:46:43,300
think we are negotiating but we are all
on two different pages and the the, the,

770
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:45,920
the Twain shall never meet
kind of a syndrome. Yeah.

771
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:50,100
Which, which is a question what is right
for the users, what's right for, yeah,

772
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:54,190
exactly. Not Fair. Um, so I
think we, we ready to close,

773
00:46:54,191 --> 00:46:58,210
but I do want to open it up to
audience questions. But before I do,

774
00:46:58,211 --> 00:47:02,680
I just want to talk about, just summarize
thinks that, uh, everybody has said,

775
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:06,040
so I know you spoke about
personal branding, evolving,

776
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:11,230
building it on your strength and building
a consistent story and you do that

777
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:14,060
through your poems,
poetry writing to,

778
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:19,170
you spoke about using digital media and
writing as well and really working on

779
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:23,810
people perception value
system and pushing us forward.

780
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:28,900
A great anecdotes there as
well. Um, you've always, I,

781
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:32,950
we've even in the past when we beat in
meetings to always spoken about Google as

782
00:47:32,951 --> 00:47:33,610
a brand,

783
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:38,610
Google hydropower bot as a brand and
spoken about pos system can asking for a

784
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:43,270
consist and consistently
asking for the right message,

785
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:47,020
which is dependency and
dependability and luxury.

786
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:51,130
You have been amazing in terms of
working on story telling with people and

787
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,670
really all,

788
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:56,740
all the anecdote you gave about
being authentic and being out there.

789
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:57,970
Before we close,

790
00:47:57,971 --> 00:48:02,080
I just wanted to each of you to give
one thing that you'd like a corporate

791
00:48:02,081 --> 00:48:02,920
audience too.

792
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:05,270
Oh,
you live with,

793
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:10,550
I think I always look for, it doesn't
matter. Corporate audience or whoever.

794
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:14,600
I think it's wonderful to
find amazing heroes around.

795
00:48:14,601 --> 00:48:15,890
Doesn't celebrate them.

796
00:48:15,891 --> 00:48:18,740
So one of the things that bugs made
when we say who's your role model?

797
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:23,570
All our role models, a western or
the cricketers are there film people?

798
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:26,780
We don't look at amazing stories
that are happening around us.

799
00:48:26,781 --> 00:48:29,930
And I think instead of looking
for inspiration somewhere else,

800
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:32,450
I think the inspiration
is right around you.

801
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:36,230
And I think it's the person who comes,
works in your house, your neighbor,

802
00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:39,350
you know, your local
grocer, whatever it is.

803
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:43,850
I think we need to find great
stories around us. That's what I,

804
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,480
I value.
I know.

805
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:52,830
Uh, I think it's most important that you
know who you are well and if you need to

806
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:55,330
help him, that will help you
do it with a genetic test.

807
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:58,353
Very smart.

808
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:06,350
So what I'll share here is not
necessarily for a corporate audience,

809
00:49:06,351 --> 00:49:10,160
but it worked for me because I'd
spent 14 years in corporates. Um,

810
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:12,980
there's a lot of things that
we all want to achieve in life.

811
00:49:12,981 --> 00:49:15,350
A lot of us have bucket lists
in the stuff we want to do.

812
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:19,220
We always wondering about how it's
going to pan out, where we going to be,

813
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:21,320
how is life going to play out?
I just,

814
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:25,430
I keep one more time for myself
itches every two, three years. I see.

815
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:30,310
What do I really want to be good at? What
do I really want to be good at, right.

816
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:33,890
Kick asset. And then how do
I figured out how to do that.

817
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:39,340
And that's why my life has been fairly
exciting because every three years I say,

818
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:42,440
now what do I really want
to be? Kick ass? I know.

819
00:49:42,441 --> 00:49:46,470
I figured out how to be kick ass at it.
It just keeps life exciting and why?

820
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:50,600
So figuring out what you want to be really
good at and then I'm figuring out how

821
00:49:50,601 --> 00:49:53,180
to get there, the journey
to be interesting. Huh?

822
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:55,210
Okay. Yeah. I think, uh,

823
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:59,140
somebody is a be who you are,
uh,

824
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:02,520
be self aware and, um, you know,

825
00:50:03,490 --> 00:50:08,490
live with your strengths rather than
Franklin on your ads that just focus on

826
00:50:09,241 --> 00:50:10,980
your strength and God alone.
Correct.

827
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:14,730
Thank you so much. Thank
you. [inaudible] one Lakshmi.

828
00:50:14,731 --> 00:50:16,830
We've been trying to get
them for a long time,

829
00:50:16,831 --> 00:50:19,920
but finally we could get the
schedules to match. Really,

830
00:50:19,921 --> 00:50:23,250
really appreciate the time you've
taken to talk to Googlers. Thank you.

831
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:27,870
[inaudible].
