1
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:12,440
So just a little bit of context. Um, um,

2
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,260
for a long time, obviously we were
subsistence farmers and then, uh,

3
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:21,080
we've had several industrial
revolutions over time. Um,

4
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:24,280
we are now on the precipice of
the fourth industrial revolution,

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,640
a pretty significant
impact on our workforce,

6
00:00:30,911 --> 00:00:31,930
our global workforce.

7
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:37,230
What has been consistent for each of these
industrial revolutions for success is

8
00:00:38,141 --> 00:00:39,400
human ingenuity,

9
00:00:39,401 --> 00:00:43,510
human creativity and the for
us to create opportunities.

10
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:44,590
Um,

11
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:49,590
and I am firmly a believer
and an optimistic sort of
growth mindset that we will

12
00:00:51,521 --> 00:00:55,180
always find enough work for people to do.
We,

13
00:00:55,181 --> 00:00:59,050
it is our responsibility be coming
from the center of the universe here,

14
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,340
Silicon Valley,
uh,

15
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:06,460
that it's our responsibility to sort
of lead that transition for the,

16
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:07,750
certainly the United States,

17
00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:12,751
the global workforce into that
new state where work is very,

18
00:01:12,881 --> 00:01:15,540
very different.
Um,

19
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,690
one of the ways works is very
different is, is sort of grounded in,

20
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,850
in Internet of things,
right?

21
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:25,870
The cyber physical system
that coming together of, um,

22
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,780
of these two worlds.
Um,

23
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,810
certainly I don't need
to tell you about this,

24
00:01:31,811 --> 00:01:36,811
but this puts us in technology in a
good place because we understand this,

25
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:41,900
we understand the impact
that this has on jobs, um,

26
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:46,870
and how Iot is displacing a lot of,
um,

27
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:51,400
traditional sort of blue collar, high
school education type of jobs. Um,

28
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:56,050
and, um, that is creating
a pretty significant, um,

29
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:01,110
divide and a is a really an opportunity
for us to sort of step up and help

30
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:07,420
bridge this gap and bring
more people along. Um,

31
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:12,010
just a quick case study
of, um, of tech, right?

32
00:02:12,011 --> 00:02:15,070
So in this 25 year period,
um,

33
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:19,480
we saw a real shift in how,
uh, the economy, you know,

34
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:24,520
sort of major economic forces happen
in the United States and in the world.

35
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:28,840
Um, it's fantastic for shareholders. Um,

36
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:33,220
but there's a pretty significant
impact on workers, right?

37
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:37,990
So in this 25 years, about the
same amount of revenue, um,

38
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:42,940
and about 10, uh, 10 x
less number of employees,

39
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,790
right? Um, so a really
different type of work, um,

40
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:50,560
and a really different type
of worker, right? So, um,

41
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:54,400
uh, if you have an iPhone, you can
turn it over and it says Maroon.

42
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,530
It says manufactured in,
yeah. Designed in Cupertino,

43
00:02:57,531 --> 00:03:00,400
in manufacturing in China or something
like, or, or designed in California,

44
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:02,590
manufactured in China. Um, so it's,

45
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,790
it's a great example of these
two different economies, right?

46
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:11,680
Manufacturing economy, the creative
economy, um, and the creative economy,

47
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,510
there's a lot more spoils.

48
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,900
There's a lot more wealth
that's generated for what,

49
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:21,130
for a much fewer number of people and a
really different type of person, right?

50
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:26,610
And maybe that was okay for a
while when tech was smaller,

51
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,570
but as Iot gets into
everything that we do,

52
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:36,340
every device, every Roomba, everything in
the world, right, is going to have some,

53
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,550
um, iot system in it. That
cyber physical system,

54
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:44,820
there's going to be this incredible
demand for engineering skills and just not

55
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,720
enough people to meet that demand.

56
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:51,700
So this model won't hold moving forward.

57
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:56,730
We won't be able to generate this amount
of revenue and this amount of market

58
00:03:58,511 --> 00:04:02,230
capitalization with this few
number of people moving forward.

59
00:04:02,231 --> 00:04:05,260
We'll need to expand
this, uh, this number,

60
00:04:05,261 --> 00:04:09,670
this 137,000 employees.
Uh, just for comparison,

61
00:04:09,671 --> 00:04:12,460
this is, um, these two numbers,

62
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:16,240
1.2 million employees
and 37 million employees.

63
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:21,370
That is the entire production
supply chain, right? So that's, um,

64
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,400
that's everybody who's making a spark
plug and making tires and assembling them

65
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,430
everything to the point of
sale. So, um, this causes a,

66
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,680
a challenge for us, right?
Um, we already know, right?

67
00:04:34,681 --> 00:04:37,110
This is not new information that,
um,

68
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:42,390
1% of the global population controls 50%
of global wealth and 50% of the global

69
00:04:43,031 --> 00:04:45,850
population has 1% of the wealth.
Um,

70
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:50,620
that's not new information at all. Um, we,

71
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:51,220
uh,

72
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:56,220
we know that rising quality and wealth
disparity as a significant a problem,

73
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,740
um, but it affects all of us, right? Uh,

74
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:05,970
because societies that have the
greatest wealth disparity also have,

75
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:10,780
um, the greatest instability, right? Um,

76
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,680
you can see here more violence,
more people in prison and more obesity,

77
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,630
a lower life expectancy.
Um,

78
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:21,430
lower trust in government systems
and institutions, things like that.

79
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,220
Inequality is rising in all countries.

80
00:05:24,221 --> 00:05:28,120
Even those that have experienced
rapid growth and a drop in the overall

81
00:05:28,121 --> 00:05:30,490
percentage of people living in poverty.
Right?

82
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:35,610
So this is something
again, um, the mission of,

83
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,330
of your tech company.
My Tech Might,

84
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,960
my tech company is make the world a
better place and improve people's lives,

85
00:05:40,961 --> 00:05:41,500
right?

86
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,640
We're in tech because we have the power
to make the world a better place and

87
00:05:45,641 --> 00:05:49,330
we're super excited. We're going to,
you know, use our passion and our,

88
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:54,360
and our energy, uh, to
help society. And, um,

89
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,440
so it, I feel a tremendous
responsibility, a responsibility, uh,

90
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:03,380
to do what we can to, um, you know,
to really further that mission.

91
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:08,410
And I feel like I can do that in my role
as the head of talent and learning at

92
00:06:09,051 --> 00:06:11,930
SAP, which is a major
tech company. You know,

93
00:06:11,931 --> 00:06:16,220
as we're looking at projecting out
the talent needs for the future,

94
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,930
the next five,
seven years,

95
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:21,320
I know how many engineers I'm
going to need in which countries,

96
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,730
and I know how many engineers are coming
online and there's not enough. Right?

97
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:30,290
And I know that the
staffing needs for most of,

98
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,590
um,
most of the other companies in the world,

99
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,940
major sort of players and
there's not enough people, right?

100
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:43,300
So there's a tremendous concern that
we need to do more to sort of help fill

101
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:48,290
that gap, right? Uh, we
know that, um, you know,

102
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:52,660
there's a lot of very exciting
technology coming online and, um,

103
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:57,620
great opportunities with that technology.
But there's also a lot of disruption.

104
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:01,220
Again, I'm very optimistic that
we can work our way through it,

105
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:05,630
but I feel like we need to do more,
um, to smooth that out. Right?

106
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,040
Um, so as we look at the
impact that technology has,

107
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:11,720
so,
um,

108
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:16,990
driver is the highest self
identified job in the United States,

109
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:22,040
right? So this includes, uh,
not just 18 wheeler drivers,

110
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:26,960
long haul trucks. Uh, this
includes taxi drivers, Uber's, um,

111
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,320
school bus drivers, city transit
drivers, private limousines, right?

112
00:07:30,321 --> 00:07:35,321
So driver is the highest
self identified job.

113
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,810
Um, and, um,

114
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,450
there's an opportunity here
as this technology comes
online to be think about a

115
00:07:44,451 --> 00:07:49,451
retraining and to think about what is the
education that is best for these types

116
00:07:50,601 --> 00:07:51,080
of workers.

117
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,830
And one of the things that I think about
in my role is what is that cutoff point?

118
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:55,430
Um,

119
00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:00,430
what is the tipping point when you
can take talent and transition them to

120
00:08:00,861 --> 00:08:04,040
something new?
And when is the point where you say,

121
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:09,041
this particular type of talent is best
to learn not programming skills but

122
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:12,770
entrepreneurial skills because they're
going to need to do a little bit more

123
00:08:12,771 --> 00:08:17,771
pulling themselves up and
figuring something out because
we as a society may not

124
00:08:17,991 --> 00:08:22,220
be able to create enough jobs for
them. Right? So how can we help these,

125
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:27,460
these different folks? Um, a quick
story. My, uh, my mother and when,

126
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:31,760
Eh, when I was a little kid, I grew up
in the, in the 70s in Sacramento Valley.

127
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:32,893
And uh,

128
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,470
she was a bookkeeper at a local travel
agency and the local travel agency was in

129
00:08:36,471 --> 00:08:41,471
the Mall Davis time for travel
and all of the moms worked there.

130
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,550
And, you know, that was back in the day,

131
00:08:43,551 --> 00:08:46,440
if anybody can remember where you had
to like make an appointment to get a,

132
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,450
a paper ticket to go from San
Francisco to Frankfurt. And you know,

133
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,940
that was what travel agents did.
Um,

134
00:08:52,941 --> 00:08:57,480
so certainly a huge change
in the travel industry, uh,

135
00:08:57,481 --> 00:09:00,900
companies like Expedia and Travelocity
and Priceline and things like that.

136
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:05,010
So the travel industry
saw a huge increase,

137
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,520
but travel agents, right?
We saw a huge decline,

138
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:12,810
about a 40% decline from
the peak in 2002 today,

139
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:17,730
um, of that type of job. So people
who are travel agents, right?

140
00:09:17,731 --> 00:09:22,080
Those jobs were all over the United States
in every little mall here and there,

141
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,150
and they were great middle class jobs,
a high school education jobs.

142
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:27,900
Um,

143
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,890
and now the industry is doing great but
really different type of job in a really

144
00:09:31,891 --> 00:09:33,320
different location,
right?

145
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:37,350
So no longer spread out all
over the country equally, right?

146
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:41,070
Sort of concentrated in tech hubs
and different types of companies.

147
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,130
So my mom did fine.

148
00:09:44,131 --> 00:09:48,330
She was a bookkeeper and she just went
and became a bookkeeper at another little,

149
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:52,200
uh, you know, business in town. Um,

150
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,370
but not everybody has sort of has that
resilience depending on the type of

151
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,000
skills that they have and what
is our responsibility, um,

152
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:04,350
to sort of think about and plan for the,
um,

153
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:09,240
the job changes that are
happening across the country. Um,

154
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,240
so this, uh, study was,

155
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:15,810
it's a 2013 Oxford University study
and it was praised when it came out for

156
00:10:15,811 --> 00:10:20,640
being both, um, incredibly visionary
and, uh, very criticized as a,

157
00:10:20,641 --> 00:10:25,170
as an alarmist. So it's probably
something in between as we look at,

158
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:29,040
um, the different jobs that
were, are likely to go away.

159
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:33,270
And we see the same pattern for every
sort of wave of industrial revolution.

160
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:38,270
The jobs that are most likely to be
eliminated are the ones that are,

161
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:43,110
um, uh, the highest in, um,

162
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:47,640
physical skills and the lowest
in cognition. Right. Um,

163
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,600
so, um, w there's also other, uh,

164
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:56,690
research that 83% of people whose
who are earning $20 an hour or less,

165
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:02,520
their jobs are likely to be eliminated
in the next five years due to automation.

166
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,840
Right?
Um,

167
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,370
the jobs that are least likely to be
eliminated or the most safe are the ones

168
00:11:08,371 --> 00:11:12,630
that have a high amount of human
skills. What is uniquely human, right?

169
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:17,340
What can't be automated, what can't
be outsourced, what can't go online.

170
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:21,780
Um, and things that have a high
amount of human manipulation,

171
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:25,980
creativity, social perception,
things like that. Right? Uh,

172
00:11:25,981 --> 00:11:29,820
we'll see a very significant increase
in psychologists, human resources,

173
00:11:29,821 --> 00:11:33,060
people that are helping others
cope with change, right?

174
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,860
You have a thought.
There you go.

175
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:42,720
Job Security. Um, so, um,

176
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,550
there is,

177
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:49,550
you could probably tell just by reading
the news that we are at the lowest

178
00:11:49,561 --> 00:11:54,130
levels of unemployment in a while,
but the highest levels of, right.

179
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,040
So we, we, we can sense that,
um, people are doing well, um,

180
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,980
but maybe underemployed and nervous.

181
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:07,240
Um, so, um,

182
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:11,980
our economy, um, and if
we look across a host of,

183
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:17,170
of industries is really in badly need
of workers skilled in computer science,

184
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,790
right?
Um,

185
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,770
they're half a million jobs going unfilled
now and in a few years it's estimated

186
00:12:23,771 --> 00:12:27,820
that nearly a third of all
computer science related
jobs will be left unfilled.

187
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,360
We graduate in the United States about
43,000 computer science graduates a year.

188
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:38,380
Um,
and a 10th of all new jobs,

189
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,800
um,
are ones that haven't yet been created.

190
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:48,450
So we're looking for people
for occupations that haven't
yet even been designed.

191
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:52,600
Right? So, uh, another study that, um,

192
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:57,790
in in a f if you started a four
year computer science degree today,

193
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,680
by the time you graduate
in four years from now,

194
00:12:59,681 --> 00:13:04,180
your freshmen content is no longer valid.
So incredible rate of change.

195
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:04,960
Um,

196
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,820
and really the best thing that we can
do for people is help them focus on

197
00:13:09,821 --> 00:13:14,800
fundamental human skills,
resilience, creativity, innovation,

198
00:13:14,801 --> 00:13:19,750
social perception, a cross
cultural awareness. Um, you know,

199
00:13:19,751 --> 00:13:23,250
these are really what is
significantly human, um,

200
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:28,080
and can't be at risk
of automation, um, uh,

201
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:32,800
an outsourcing.
So some other stats that should worry us.

202
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:36,760
Um, we're not in good
shape globally, right? Um,

203
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:41,850
these are the 34 market economies that
make up the Organization for Economic

204
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:47,470
Cooperation and development. Um, and
you can see that, um, for example,

205
00:13:47,471 --> 00:13:50,500
Japan always comes out on in the,

206
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:55,590
in the worst spot in this because they
are significantly high aging population.

207
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,020
Um, and um, and also, you know,

208
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,840
the increased life expectancy is making
it a challenge in a lot of countries as

209
00:14:04,841 --> 00:14:09,250
we try to transition to
something that is new,

210
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:12,880
um, people are less
comfortable as they get older.

211
00:14:12,881 --> 00:14:15,040
Transitioning to something that
is really, really new. There's a,

212
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:19,600
if you're born today in North America,
there's a 50% chance of living to 105.

213
00:14:19,601 --> 00:14:23,170
If you're born today in Japan,
there's a 50% chance of living to 110.

214
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:28,500
So how do we think about preparing the
future workforce when our careers will be

215
00:14:28,991 --> 00:14:31,360
50, 60 years long? Right? And you know,

216
00:14:31,361 --> 00:14:35,530
what is the education that you need to
give you that foundation of resilience

217
00:14:35,531 --> 00:14:39,130
and fundamental human skills
to be prepared for a very,

218
00:14:39,131 --> 00:14:40,660
very long duration of change.

219
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:47,140
So this is 16 to 25 to 16 to 65 year olds.

220
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:50,710
But what about our kids? Right? Um,

221
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,520
fundamentally I'm an educator.

222
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:57,410
So given what we know about the future
of technology and how essential computer

223
00:14:57,411 --> 00:14:59,600
skills are to our economy,

224
00:14:59,601 --> 00:15:04,601
it seems pretty logical that understanding
the algorithms and applications and

225
00:15:05,181 --> 00:15:09,410
the Internet is going to be
essential for our kids. Um,

226
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:13,400
health are there economic,
uh, abilities to,

227
00:15:13,401 --> 00:15:16,310
to sustain themselves in the workforce.
Um,

228
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:21,170
and it's probably moving forward
just as important as understanding

229
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,120
photosynthesis and the digestive system
and, you know, electricity, right? Um,

230
00:15:26,121 --> 00:15:31,121
so we need to really engage with our
school systems to understand how we can

231
00:15:31,851 --> 00:15:34,910
create the workforce of
the future. Um, similarly,

232
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:38,720
when I talked about before that there's
sort of this threshold of when you can

233
00:15:38,721 --> 00:15:42,350
teach people things that are brand new
and then when it's time for them to learn

234
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:45,960
entrepreneurial skills to create
something new on their own. Um,

235
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:50,870
because of the talent needs
that are coming online
across all of these countries

236
00:15:50,871 --> 00:15:52,370
and all of our companies,

237
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:57,640
we can see a very significant demand for
certain skills and not enough graduates

238
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:01,580
coming online across all of our
countries that can meet that demand.

239
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,820
So we have to dig deep,
um,

240
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,740
across all of our companies and dig into
the k through 12 system to make sure

241
00:16:09,741 --> 00:16:13,700
that it's preparing the workforce
of the future. 10, 20, 30 years out.

242
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:21,390
So, um, what's a super bummer? Now
we're going to get into this stuff.

243
00:16:21,391 --> 00:16:22,860
It's all just a huge bummer.

244
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:28,080
So 90% of parents want their
kids to learn computer science,

245
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:31,680
but only 40% of schools
across the country teach it.

246
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,293
MMM.

247
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:39,550
And what's awesome is that kids that
take computer science really enjoy it.

248
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:43,360
Right? Um, schools that have
computer science and engineering,

249
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:47,470
the kids are excited about that.
So parents want them to learn it,

250
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,500
kids want to learn it. Uh, tech companies,

251
00:16:50,501 --> 00:16:55,250
all companies are desperate for
these graduates to have it. Um,

252
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,730
we don't have enough graduates now,
but I'm not thinking about today.

253
00:16:57,731 --> 00:16:59,590
I'm thinking about 10,
20 years out.

254
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,700
So that's why I'm focusing on this
population to get them ready. Um,

255
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:06,430
and we see a very significant,
um,

256
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:10,450
disconnect in the coming
in the coming years. Um,

257
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:15,050
this is not new information,
right? Everybody knows that
a lifetime earning of, uh,

258
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:19,930
a college graduate is a significantly
higher than high school graduate, right?

259
00:17:19,931 --> 00:17:23,950
20 x is your lifetime earnings.
Um,

260
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:27,700
it as a college graduate,
but also as a computer science graduate,

261
00:17:27,701 --> 00:17:32,701
it's 40% higher than the average
of all other degrees combined.

262
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,500
Right?
Um,

263
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:40,770
and so computing jobs are the number
one source of wage growth in the United

264
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:43,660
States,
in every industry in every state,

265
00:17:43,661 --> 00:17:47,410
and they're projected to grow at twice
the rate of all other jobs combined.

266
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,680
Um,
again,

267
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,980
there's only 43,000 computer science grads
that come online a year in the United

268
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,620
States. So, um,

269
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:03,600
states that invest in computer science
education really reap the economic

270
00:18:03,601 --> 00:18:07,110
benefit as well. It's not just at a
personal level, it's at a state level.

271
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:11,250
So there's only, there's only 10 states
in California, isn't one of them, um,

272
00:18:11,251 --> 00:18:15,610
that have k through 12 computer
science and education standards. Um,

273
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:16,830
in 2017,

274
00:18:16,831 --> 00:18:21,630
those 10 states were 9% more likely than
states without k through 12 computer

275
00:18:21,631 --> 00:18:26,090
science standards to see unemployment
fall. So this was original.

276
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:31,610
So in the U S W I think we all sort of
know this intuitively that governments

277
00:18:31,801 --> 00:18:35,730
and corporations change, um, at
a really different rate, right?

278
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,500
So,
um,

279
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:42,830
this chart shows the rate of change of
technology is the blue run here and then

280
00:18:43,711 --> 00:18:48,480
the rate of change of public
policy in alignment to that. Um,

281
00:18:48,481 --> 00:18:52,770
so what I am really challenged to do
and would love to put out the challenge

282
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:57,270
others to is see what we can do to sort
of close this gap, this change gap.

283
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,543
Um,

284
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:03,980
can we look at other sources of computer
science education to get more people

285
00:19:05,401 --> 00:19:09,240
engaged in this solution? Um, I uh,

286
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:14,630
am also a firm believer that perhaps we
can do more in our HR departments and

287
00:19:15,451 --> 00:19:19,690
our hiring, um, to meet
people halfway, um,

288
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:24,780
or meet people a little closer
to where they are. Right. Um,

289
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:29,250
this is just a quick
snapshot of Silicon Valley's,

290
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,690
um, community college system, right?

291
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:37,410
So some basic facts about the
California community colleges.

292
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:42,330
2.1 million students are enrolled
in California community colleges.

293
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:46,890
They are the nation's largest
institution of higher education,

294
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,470
114 schools. They are, um,

295
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:55,440
across California, 67%, um,

296
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:00,390
ethnically diverse.
Um, and uh, 53% female,

297
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:05,690
30% of all 16 to 24 year olds in the
state of California are enrolled in a

298
00:20:08,851 --> 00:20:12,780
California community college.
30% of every kid,

299
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,180
16 to 24.
Um,

300
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:20,100
so that's across the state.
But here in Silicon Valley,

301
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:24,330
um,
we have 17 colleges,

302
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:29,360
263,000 students and
70,000 of them are in stem.

303
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,870
They are 71% diverse
here in silicon valley.

304
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,580
But what's super cool,

305
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:40,610
I think is that a 30% of the grads from
all ucs are California community college

306
00:20:44,731 --> 00:20:49,540
transfers.
And 50% of the grads have all CSU,

307
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:52,810
who's our California community
college transfers, right?

308
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:58,410
48% of all stem graduates
from all UC schools,

309
00:20:59,351 --> 00:21:02,950
Ucla, UC Berkeley, our California
community college transfers.

310
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:08,430
Almost 50% of every engineer that
graduates started in California community

311
00:21:08,921 --> 00:21:10,330
college school.
Right?

312
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:15,750
So as we look to broadening our pool
of people that we're recruiting from,

313
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,280
uh, and helping more people
sort of move forward,

314
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:26,580
I'd like to challenge us all intac to
think about where we're recruiting from

315
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,010
and who we're looking for as we pull
people into the workforce of the future.

316
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:38,650
So, um, there are a ton of benefits, um,

317
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:43,330
to California community college
schools, uh, um, uh, kids.

318
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:47,890
And I should also say that it's
really tough to transfer. Um,

319
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:52,090
only 4% of the kids that are enrolled.

320
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:57,120
So 4% of the 2.1 million students
transfer to a four year school.

321
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:00,130
Um,
it's really hard.

322
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,510
And so you get somebody who's been
through the system and come out, um,

323
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:10,330
then you know, that person is pretty
resilient and smart and, and determined.

324
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:14,260
And so those are also
great characteristics to be
looking for as we look to the

325
00:22:14,261 --> 00:22:16,390
future of,
of the talent.

326
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:21,870
And let me also tell you a reason
why I am super bullish about,

327
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:27,460
uh, this system as I'm
a product of it. So, um,

328
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:31,180
I have a confession to make.
I says why I'm super motivated about this.

329
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:35,290
So I kind of like barely
graduated high school. Um,

330
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:39,460
and um,
went to the local community college.

331
00:22:39,461 --> 00:22:40,600
I grew up in Sacramento Valley,

332
00:22:40,601 --> 00:22:44,320
so I went to American River College in
Sacramento and it was there that I was

333
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:49,321
diagnosed as dyslexic and
attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder and obsessive

334
00:22:49,871 --> 00:22:52,870
compulsive disorder,
which my high school didn't recognize.

335
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:56,380
They just thought I couldn't sit still
and everyday I got wiggly and they would

336
00:22:56,381 --> 00:22:59,620
just send me out to run the track.
And so I was super athlete,

337
00:22:59,621 --> 00:23:02,400
but I really didn't learn a lot.
And uh,

338
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:06,040
so they figured this out at the community
college and they gave me the resources

339
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:08,470
that we need.
So I went from sort of deeds to A's,

340
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,990
transferred to UC Berkeley
on an academic scholarship,

341
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:15,340
and then a master's at Stanford on
an academic scholarship. So, um,

342
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,350
what does this have to do
with the Internet of things
and the automation of jobs

343
00:23:20,351 --> 00:23:21,430
in the Future of workforce?

344
00:23:21,431 --> 00:23:26,431
It's really about opening our eyes to an
alternative path and opening our minds

345
00:23:26,981 --> 00:23:31,330
to what needs to happen if we're going
to have a strong economy and adjust

346
00:23:31,331 --> 00:23:33,640
society, right? When we,

347
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:38,790
if we're trying to make a difference
about wealth disparity and a stable

348
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,230
society, it's about inclusion, right?

349
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:47,120
It's including all sorts of people from
all kinds of backgrounds in that future.

350
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:47,750
Um,

351
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:52,750
because there's going to be a lot of
disruption of a certain type of person and

352
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,280
we could do a lot more in tech
to include those people. Um,

353
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:03,310
I heard the term tech lash
for the first time in,

354
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,240
I read,

355
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,970
I was reading the economist maybe three
weeks ago and it said there's a tech

356
00:24:07,971 --> 00:24:11,570
lash coming against silicon
valley against, by Washington.

357
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:15,230
And I was heard that for the first
time and I was physically shaking,

358
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:19,100
so I think we could do
more, right? I mean, I'm a,

359
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:23,180
I'm a silicon valley person. I said, you
know, Berkeley, Stanford, I'm like, here,

360
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:24,890
this is,
this is my world.

361
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:30,020
And we could do more to help people
in other parts of the country,

362
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:34,580
uh, to participate in the future of work.
Because we're going to need everybody,

363
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:38,030
right? So, um,

364
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,850
you guys are doing a
tremendous amount already,

365
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,150
so I'm not here to preach to you and
tell you that you should do something

366
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:48,470
different because you are absolutely
a role model in reaching out.

367
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:53,330
Um,
you have a tremendous volunteer culture.

368
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:58,100
Um, I was doing some research about you
and you have this great partnership with,

369
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:01,330
with goodwill, which I did not know. Um,

370
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:05,260
he's the largest workforce development
nonprofit in the country. Um,

371
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:10,280
and you've pledged $10 million and a
thousand Google volunteers to create

372
00:25:11,481 --> 00:25:13,940
opportunities for 1.2 million youth,

373
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:18,320
formerly incarcerated and
displaced workers and veterans, um,

374
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:22,730
to give them digital skills to
participate in the future of work, um,

375
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:27,770
at the 156 goodwill stores across
the country. So that's fantastic.

376
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:31,580
That's fantastic. Um, so
certainly applaud these efforts,

377
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:36,800
but there's so many more things
that, um, we as a tech community,

378
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:37,670
um,

379
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:41,510
and we who are all sitting pretty with
our great degrees and our wonderful jobs

380
00:25:41,511 --> 00:25:42,470
in our great future,

381
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:47,620
there's a lot more that we can do to bring
a more inclusive view into the talent

382
00:25:48,501 --> 00:25:49,190
that we need.

383
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:53,690
So it's really about being open minded
to all kinds of talent and all kinds of

384
00:25:53,691 --> 00:25:54,710
backgrounds,
right?

385
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:58,940
Look for those scrappy people that had
to pull themselves up and do something

386
00:25:58,941 --> 00:26:02,360
the hard way because maybe they've
got some cool skills that we could all

387
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:07,100
benefit from. Um, encourage
students of all ages, um,

388
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:11,690
to, you know, it's, it's never too
late to learn something new and,

389
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,460
and to dig deep and try
and do something different.

390
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,840
And then my strongest call to action is
really around lobbying for k through 12

391
00:26:17,841 --> 00:26:22,480
computer science education.
Um, and this is why,

392
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,900
even if you don't have kids,
right,

393
00:26:23,901 --> 00:26:28,600
this is about doing what's
right for the community, um,

394
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:33,260
and the future of work because we
all want to live in a just society.

395
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,070
Um,

396
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:38,450
and in and in a place with that sort of
closes that wealth divide so that we can

397
00:26:38,451 --> 00:26:43,070
have, um, you know, a
safer and more harmonious,

398
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:47,970
um, uh, environment,
uh, to, to, to live in.

399
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,600
So there are interesting
things that can be done.

400
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:56,190
It's not just around, um,
volunteering at a school, but,

401
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:00,450
um,
people who are working in schools,

402
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,470
they know that they have a
significant challenge. Right? Um,

403
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,370
it's not just going to the
school and saying, well,

404
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:09,040
why don't you just put through
a, you know, a computer
science, you know, standards.

405
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:11,730
They know that they should, why don't
you just hire computer science teachers?

406
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:12,810
They know that they should,

407
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:18,170
they cannot recruit computer science
teachers at the rate at which school

408
00:27:18,391 --> 00:27:21,150
districts can pay, right?
If you have those skills,

409
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,810
you're going to go to a place like,
you know, your company, your mind,

410
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:29,520
and are a lot of others. Um,
so what can we do to, um,

411
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,500
you know, sponsor a teacher, uh, pay
for a teaching role. Um, you know,

412
00:27:34,501 --> 00:27:37,410
maybe five engineers get together
and they all work a four,

413
00:27:37,411 --> 00:27:40,950
10 schedule and everybody rotates and,
you know,

414
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:44,880
to actually teaches a class, um, you
know, there are things that we can do.

415
00:27:44,881 --> 00:27:48,520
You can adopt a school, you can
adopt, you know, just like a, um,

416
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:52,560
a chaired professorship at a
university, you know, sponsor, uh,

417
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:56,760
the computer science department
out of school, things like that.

418
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:01,790
Um, so there's a lot that can be
done to get creative. I've been, um,

419
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,870
talking with different people,
um,

420
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:08,930
and at a national level around
creating social sabbatical programs for

421
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:15,570
employees, check employees
to go and volunteer for
three months and a government

422
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:20,590
organization, right, go, you know,
there's more that we can do, um,

423
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:25,290
to make our presence felt. Um, and,

424
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:29,940
uh, this is just a, it's not
just good for, uh, schools.

425
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:34,590
It's good for us. So this is a
quote from a Google employee about,

426
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:38,730
um, how this really changed his life. Um,

427
00:28:38,731 --> 00:28:42,240
so I found this quote
on the code.org a site.

428
00:28:42,241 --> 00:28:44,430
So I was super excited to,
uh,

429
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:47,640
to see a colleague of yours who
was making such a great impact.

430
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,090
And, um, and there's,

431
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:56,210
I want to leave you with some links of
things that you can go and check out,

432
00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:01,670
uh, about ways to help.
So thoughts, questions,

433
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,780
feedback, ideas, reactions, anything.

434
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:11,180
Hr People, marketing people. Yes, please.

435
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,260
You mentioned,
um,

436
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:15,980
elementary school education and
then the community college scene.

437
00:29:15,981 --> 00:29:20,981
But I also keep hearing that applying
to schools is getting so challenging and

438
00:29:21,041 --> 00:29:23,660
it,
and kids have a lot of anxiety around it.

439
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:28,661
So is it also that we have to increase
the number of four year programs or is it

440
00:29:29,091 --> 00:29:32,460
really earlier than that? It's,
it's earlier than that. I mean,

441
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:38,430
there is restaurant anxiety and in all
these levels and a lot that we could do

442
00:29:38,961 --> 00:29:43,960
to make people feel that a lot of
different pads are worthy. Right.

443
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:48,970
Um, and make, I mean, w when
I keep, I have four kids.

444
00:29:48,971 --> 00:29:51,640
What I keep telling, you know,
when I go talk to schools,

445
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:55,330
there's a lot of second
chances in this country, right?

446
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:59,170
You're going to have a long career,
right? You're going to work for 50 years.

447
00:29:59,171 --> 00:30:03,880
There is nobody saying in their
right mind that you have to do x,

448
00:30:03,881 --> 00:30:08,050
Y,Z in four years. Right?
Explore, uh, take risks,

449
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:12,160
learn new things, go to culinary school,
change your mind, do this for 10 years.

450
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:14,500
Go get another degree doing
something else for five years.

451
00:30:14,501 --> 00:30:17,560
Get a different degree,
stack a bunch of micro credentials.

452
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:21,850
There's lots of different ways to get
to, you know, a really satisfying,

453
00:30:21,851 --> 00:30:26,050
joyful life. There's not one path.
So it's kind of goes back to your,

454
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:28,520
your point.
Um,

455
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:32,920
I'm trying to encourage HR peers,
um,

456
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:38,110
to back off a little bit from,
it must be this university at,

457
00:30:38,111 --> 00:30:41,410
it must be this degree.
Um, because I think we,

458
00:30:41,411 --> 00:30:44,950
there's enough research
and data now that says, um,

459
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:50,020
there's not a direct correlation between
this university and this degree with

460
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:54,100
high productivity and high success. You
can get there in lots of different ways.

461
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:56,140
And sometimes the cert,

462
00:30:56,170 --> 00:31:01,170
the Securitas path is what creates a
really interesting colleague and a really

463
00:31:02,531 --> 00:31:05,950
innovative perspective.
So my,

464
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:11,190
my advice and encouragement to schools
is to back off on the stress and

465
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:17,850
encourage concepts of lifelong learning
and joy and internal motivation for a

466
00:31:18,461 --> 00:31:22,920
long journey of learning and
discovery. Right. And if,

467
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:27,400
because if we don't have that from
within, we're going to be stuck. You know,

468
00:31:27,401 --> 00:31:30,130
we may be have a great degree
that lasts for 20 years,

469
00:31:30,131 --> 00:31:32,380
but what about the next 30
that you are still working

470
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,083
right.

471
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:40,900
Um, you touched on it a little bit as
you talked about the statistics around

472
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,670
community colleges in California,

473
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:46,600
but I'm wondering if you have any
researcher thoughts on as we're working to

474
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,370
kind of re skill or skill, the future
in computer science and tech. Um,

475
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:55,930
what about the intersectionality of making
sure that they're still that diverse

476
00:31:56,170 --> 00:32:00,970
workforce coming up with that? Um, I know
that's a hot topic right now. You know,

477
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:05,790
do you have a diverse workforce and tech
and we're seeing that there's gaps in

478
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:10,600
gender or different ethnic groups.
So have you done any research into how,

479
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:14,710
you know,
you can skill the future for these,

480
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,920
these needed gaps,
but also ensure that you're bringing up a,

481
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:22,440
a more representative sample
of workers as well? Yeah,

482
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,570
I mean that's why we,

483
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:27,860
I talked about the diversity in the
California community college system. Um,

484
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,331
you know,

485
00:32:28,331 --> 00:32:33,160
it's 53% female and 71% nonwhite.

486
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:37,870
So, um, these are great
opportunities to find diverse talent.

487
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,760
Um, and that's incredibly
important. I mean,

488
00:32:40,761 --> 00:32:45,440
as we think about the role of
technology in our lives moving forward,

489
00:32:45,441 --> 00:32:47,630
we can start to project out,
you know,

490
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:50,450
Internet of things and how
technology is in everything.

491
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:54,530
Do you want the people who are making
technology decisions to have a really

492
00:32:54,531 --> 00:32:58,430
consistent sort of frame of
reference or do you want that?

493
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:02,720
I want the people who are making
technology decisions to have a very broad

494
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:04,310
background.
Um,

495
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:09,340
the often quoted example I didn't make
up was about a self driving cars that you

496
00:33:10,101 --> 00:33:14,060
know, if a self driving car, um, is,

497
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:15,860
has an unavoidable collision

498
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:20,820
and there's a driver in the car and the
self driving car notices that there's

499
00:33:20,821 --> 00:33:25,350
for pedestrians on the
sidewalk or whatever, um,

500
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:27,270
and uh,
collision is absolutely unavoidable.

501
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:32,300
Does the car making the decision to save
the driver who bought the car or say

502
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,890
you know, one or save the pedestrians for
what is the right decision for society?

503
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:41,400
What's the right decision for the person
who said, well, I bought that car,

504
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:45,840
you know, you choose me, right? Because
my car or I don't know. I mean, you know,

505
00:33:45,841 --> 00:33:50,520
so that's an often quoted example of well,
who is making that decision?

506
00:33:50,521 --> 00:33:54,130
The car. Okay, well who
programmed the car? Right? Um,

507
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:58,980
who hired that programmer of that car?
Um, what do all of the cars consistently,

508
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:02,670
what decision would all those cars make?
Um,

509
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:07,500
is that the right decision?
What is right in that situation?

510
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:10,080
Right? What is just, um,

511
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:15,270
I personally would like to have a
lot of diversity in the room when the

512
00:34:15,271 --> 00:34:19,680
engineers are having conversation about
what that car should do in that decision,

513
00:34:19,681 --> 00:34:21,970
in that circumstance.
Um,

514
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:26,190
so I think it's imperative
that we have diversity,

515
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,593
um,

516
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:32,010
and the new forms of technology moving
forward so that we have a greater

517
00:34:32,011 --> 00:34:33,430
representative,
uh,

518
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:38,210
viewpoint in these really interesting
sort of ethical conversations that

519
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,770
need to happen. Yeah, please.

520
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,920
So there's a lot of companies now
with the massive online classes. Yeah,

521
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:58,420
sure. Of course. Sara. Sure. So it must
be a lot of students passing through that.

522
00:34:58,421 --> 00:35:01,330
And it's a question for you and
probably some people in the audience.

523
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,940
Are Those students successful?
Have they learned,

524
00:35:03,941 --> 00:35:06,640
can they use those skills
in a business workplace?

525
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:10,620
Yeah. Um, well the, um, I'm

526
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:11,470
okay,

527
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:13,060
I might get this little bit wrong,
but it's pretty close.

528
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:17,680
I think 80% of the people that are
taking moocs already have undergraduate

529
00:35:17,681 --> 00:35:18,960
degrees.
Uh,

530
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:23,710
there's about a 5% completion rate for
people to start classes to complete them.

531
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,930
Um,
uh,

532
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:30,730
the number one class on
Coursera is how to learn.

533
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:34,420
So kind of goes back to, you know, what,

534
00:35:34,421 --> 00:35:37,000
what is the most important thing
for us to know? It's how to learn.

535
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,990
You need to learn to learn.
You need to learn to unlearn.

536
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:43,260
You need to learn to relearn it.
You need to prepare yourself for 50,

537
00:35:43,261 --> 00:35:47,130
60 year career because we're
all living to 105, you know,

538
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,020
of constant change. Right? You know,
retiring early might be 70. Right?

539
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:53,100
Um,

540
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:58,100
so how do we get ourselves in a mental
space as a society of constant learning

541
00:36:00,601 --> 00:36:03,210
and constant change and being okay
with that and having that not being an

542
00:36:03,211 --> 00:36:06,810
anxiety producing experience,
but a joyful experience,

543
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:11,790
a great opportunity. Um, so yeah,
there's a lot of people that are,

544
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:16,030
um, experiencing those classes
and I, they're great. We,
we do them in our company.

545
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:19,680
You do meet yours. Um, and um,

546
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:23,100
so it's interesting. I mean, it's, um,

547
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:26,780
I think that we should be,
um,

548
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:32,720
backing off on the pressure to have the
best degree from the best school and all

549
00:36:34,111 --> 00:36:38,280
that and be more open and
accepting to diverse paths, um,

550
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:43,290
like stackable micro credentials. That's
great. You know, there's lots of ways,

551
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,240
you know, going to a code school,
they're going to a coding bootcamp.

552
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:51,320
There's lots of ways to get really
practical experience that is more open to

553
00:36:52,051 --> 00:36:53,220
diverse backgrounds.

554
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:58,043
Okay.

555
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:02,870
I have a question. Yeah. All right. So
in today's world at big tech companies,

556
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:07,910
uh, do you think, um, suppose a student,

557
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:11,960
like a community college student
did complete a Coursera course?

558
00:37:11,961 --> 00:37:15,830
Do you think that they are given due
consideration by the hiring team or do you

559
00:37:15,831 --> 00:37:20,831
think there's still a kind of an elitism
towards prestigious universities and,

560
00:37:23,261 --> 00:37:25,040
and, and, um,

561
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:29,540
what can companies like
Google and in SAP do to,

562
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,553
to fix that?

563
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:35,570
Yeah. Um, I, there's still
a us, um, uh, safety,

564
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:40,070
um, to choosing someone that
has a, um, a four year degree.

565
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:41,323
Um,

566
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:45,980
my perspective is that you should
be able to prove your experience.

567
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,130
So whether you have a,

568
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:51,800
a fancy degree from a four year school
or you have a bunch of stackable micro

569
00:37:51,801 --> 00:37:56,450
certificates on top of a community
college associate's degree, either way,

570
00:37:56,630 --> 00:38:00,560
you need to prove to me what
you know, right. As a hiring
manager, what can you do?

571
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:05,790
Um, so you know, more of a
portfolio approach to, um, the,

572
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:10,070
the hiring process where we're
talking about actual work, right?

573
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:13,940
Tell me about a time when you actually
did something right. Show me an example.

574
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:18,410
Um,
it's a great easy shortcut to say,

575
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,810
what school did you go to?
Um,

576
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,870
because we all know the vetting process
that goes through for those things.

577
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:29,180
But as the demand for workers,
it increases in and, uh,

578
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:32,030
certain roles we will need to,

579
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:37,450
we will need to expand our acceptance of
alternate paths to education for those

580
00:38:37,931 --> 00:38:39,850
particular roles.
Um,

581
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:43,690
because the university is the system
just can't produce them and bring them

582
00:38:43,691 --> 00:38:48,100
online as fast as, as they're needed
across all of our industries. Um,

583
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:52,660
so what we can do, your question is what,
what can we specifically do? We can,

584
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,920
you know, step back,
have a conversation as,

585
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:59,110
as an executive team around what are
we actually trying to accomplish?

586
00:38:59,111 --> 00:39:01,030
What is our strategy?
What are our goals?

587
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:06,330
Can we achieve these goals by having a
broader perspective to talent and how

588
00:39:08,651 --> 00:39:12,940
that talent sort of came up in the system.
So I think it really starts by us,

589
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:18,340
US as, as company sort of looking
deep into ourselves and saying,

590
00:39:18,341 --> 00:39:20,860
what are we actually trying to accomplish
here and what are the different ways

591
00:39:20,861 --> 00:39:22,030
that we can accomplish those goals?

592
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,170
Yeah. Cool. Hi,

593
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,450
I haven't seen any information on this,

594
00:39:28,451 --> 00:39:33,451
but one way I would imagine
we could increase the
incoming pool of talent is for

595
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:39,100
large companies like Google and others
to put money behind some of these

596
00:39:39,101 --> 00:39:39,934
schools.

597
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:44,860
Not for the reliance to be solely on
the government to support these schools,

598
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:48,730
but I'm not seeing, or maybe
they're just done quietly. But, um,

599
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,710
there was a time when I expected that
there would be Google you and it was a

600
00:39:53,711 --> 00:39:58,120
brick and mortar school that you could
matriculate into from any high school and

601
00:39:58,121 --> 00:40:02,790
it met all the standards, et cetera.
But the money came from within it.

602
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:07,510
Is that being thought about or done
in any way? I'm just not aware of it.

603
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:11,990
I don't know any, any plans about
Google you that's, that's not,

604
00:40:11,991 --> 00:40:14,900
that's not anything I would
have a awareness of, um,

605
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,710
confirming Google open.

606
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,120
That's what I was wondering. Yes. Yeah,

607
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:28,510
I know some companies that have MBA
programs at the company pays for,

608
00:40:28,511 --> 00:40:30,820
but they're full full programs.

609
00:40:30,821 --> 00:40:35,230
And that's where I could see that we
could expand our Cape our capacity.

610
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:39,940
Yeah. Well, yeah. So, um, many
companies do this. Sap does also,

611
00:40:39,941 --> 00:40:44,470
we sponsor five different high
schools across North America.

612
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,900
That's a partnership between the company,
uh,

613
00:40:46,901 --> 00:40:51,020
high school and a local community college.
So it's a six year high school, um,

614
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:54,640
at the end of six years you graduate
with a high school diploma and an

615
00:40:54,641 --> 00:40:58,090
associate's degree in computer science,
um,

616
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:02,200
and practical hands on experience.
So it's like an apprenticeship program.

617
00:41:02,201 --> 00:41:05,950
It's this very close collaboration.
We have one in Oakland,

618
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:11,190
there's one in New York, there's
one in Canada. So yeah. Uh,

619
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,370
other companies do that too.

620
00:41:12,371 --> 00:41:16,570
It's a great sort of first step
to making a huge difference.

621
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,533
Yeah.

622
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,890
Hi. Thank you. This is very
relevant and eye opening. Um,

623
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:28,170
so you mentioned earlier in your talk
skills for children, um, to have,

624
00:41:28,171 --> 00:41:31,360
I don't know if those children
are all people in terms of, um,

625
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:34,580
this learning path and
you mentioned resilience,

626
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:37,070
cross cultural awareness,
creativity.

627
00:41:37,071 --> 00:41:41,470
What were the other sort of essential
things to learn? Fundamental human right

628
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:45,650
skill. So creativity,
innovation, a social perception.

629
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:50,840
Um, the, uh, World Economic
Forum has a list of 16 of them.

630
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:55,490
I can send the, um, I can send
you the list and the link. Um,

631
00:41:55,970 --> 00:42:00,420
uh, emotional intelligence,
empathy, creativity, uh,

632
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:04,220
listening, active listening skills,
leadership skills. You know,

633
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:08,510
you have fundamental numeracy, fundamental
writing, fundamental communication.

634
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:12,380
But if you look at the list of, of 16
skills from the world economic forum,

635
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:14,030
it's what is,

636
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:18,710
what really jumps out is how many
are and a human to human perception.

637
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:22,870
Um, yeah, that's, that's what's
really distinctive and, and, uh,

638
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:25,610
and different and exciting to see.
Wow.

639
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,790
Thank you. Ms Deerborne.
Thank you everyone for coming.

640
00:42:27,791 --> 00:42:28,990
Let's give one more round of applause.
