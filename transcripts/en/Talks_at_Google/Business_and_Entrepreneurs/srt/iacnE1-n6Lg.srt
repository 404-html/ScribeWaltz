1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,680
Hello. Thank you for coming. It's a
pleasure being here for all of us. Um,

2
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:14,920
today I'm going to talk really briefly
but hopefully usefully about what we do

3
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,920
and give you a taste of it as well.
And our philosophical meditation,

4
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:19,870
which is one of our most loved exercises.

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,360
So first we'll talk about what
we do at the school of life,

6
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,760
then we'll talk about what
emotional intelligence is,

7
00:00:24,761 --> 00:00:26,230
how we see it at the school of life.

8
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,540
We'll talk about why it's
so important at work.

9
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,390
And also we'll talk about how we at
the school of life teach emotional

10
00:00:31,391 --> 00:00:34,400
intelligence in our classes, in
our workshops and our events. Um,

11
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,250
and sort of our technique there.

12
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,770
And finally you'll get to try it out so
you'll have a sense of how it works for

13
00:00:38,771 --> 00:00:43,030
you. We're how one of our exercises
works for you in any case. So to start,

14
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:46,690
let me tell you a little bit about
what we do at the school of life. Um,

15
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:51,400
we are a global organization dedicated
to developing emotional intelligence and

16
00:00:51,401 --> 00:00:53,290
we have 10 locations around the world,

17
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:57,310
but we operate in even more countries
than that. We have, um, first of all,

18
00:00:57,311 --> 00:01:01,210
concrete classrooms where people can
go and take workshops and classes on

19
00:01:01,211 --> 00:01:03,700
particular emotional topics as,
as was mentioned.

20
00:01:03,701 --> 00:01:07,600
So we teach things like how to make love
last and the meaning of life and how to

21
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:10,990
fail or things about how to be calm,
how to cope with anxiety.

22
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,870
We're teaching the types of skills that
you might wish that you had learned in

23
00:01:13,871 --> 00:01:15,610
school but generally aren't covered.

24
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:19,150
And in particular we're trying to save
people a little bit of time and grief

25
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,850
because these are things that otherwise
we tend to learn sometimes through

26
00:01:21,851 --> 00:01:23,050
really hard experiences.

27
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:26,170
So we'd like to save you a little bit of
that pain and a little bit of that time

28
00:01:26,171 --> 00:01:29,280
learning by doing some thinking upfront.
Um,

29
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:31,210
you can see here some of
the things that we do.

30
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:34,720
That's our classroom in London and
bloom spray and you can always come by.

31
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:39,430
We've also got a storefront in most of
our places where you can purchase some of

32
00:01:39,431 --> 00:01:41,010
our books and products.
Um,

33
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:43,720
sometimes we have big events and those
are really interesting on different

34
00:01:43,721 --> 00:01:46,990
emotional topics. And finally we've
got locations in lots of places,

35
00:01:46,991 --> 00:01:50,200
so that's a little map of
where our locations are. Um,

36
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:54,250
in particular we tend to focus our work
on two areas of life and this guy says

37
00:01:54,251 --> 00:01:55,330
it even better than we do.

38
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,080
This is Sigmund Freud and we're very
fond to Freud in of psychotherapy in

39
00:01:59,081 --> 00:01:59,411
general,

40
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:02,590
we really believe that it's beneficial
for everyone at some point in their life.

41
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:06,670
Freud said of his patience, love and
work, work in love. That's all there is.

42
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,710
And by that he meant that on the whole,

43
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,920
that was where people
came to him to talk about.

44
00:02:11,921 --> 00:02:15,250
That was the area in their life where
they really needed to explore and we find

45
00:02:15,251 --> 00:02:16,570
is the same at the school of life.

46
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,690
People come and they want to talk about
how to build fulfilling relationships

47
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,800
and how to make work fulfilling as well.
So over the last 10 years,

48
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,560
because we were founded in 2008
we're just hitting our second decade.

49
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:27,940
Over the last 10 years,

50
00:02:27,941 --> 00:02:30,490
we've been learning a lot about what
people are concerned about at work,

51
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,650
what tends to trouble then?
What tends to help,

52
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,480
what tends to make work go really well?

53
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,690
And after a while people started
coming to us and saying, you know,

54
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:41,680
the amazing thing that you taught me
about listening or about empathy or about

55
00:02:41,681 --> 00:02:45,610
patients or about keeping calm,
I'd really love to bring it to my office.

56
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:49,390
I'd love to bring it to my team. Can you
come in and teach our team that thing?

57
00:02:49,391 --> 00:02:52,900
Or can we do an exercise with my
whole organization about this perhaps.

58
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:56,260
So we began to sort of develop our
thinking around what people needed in the

59
00:02:56,261 --> 00:02:59,890
workplace and we began to provide
services to businesses, organizations,

60
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,880
and eventually we decided that roughly
there were about 20 things that people

61
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:06,580
really needed to know in
order to do well at work.

62
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,170
In terms of emotional intelligence,

63
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,440
these are the ones and you can
see that lots of different things.

64
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:16,180
So things like adaptability, diplomacy,
playfulness, self awareness, resilience,

65
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:17,043
right?

66
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:20,470
This is more or less the types of things
that people need to know in order to do

67
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:25,030
well at work. Um, so we've, we've kind
of become experts in this a little bit.

68
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:27,130
Hopefully. Uh, we also
do some other things.

69
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,270
These are some other things that we do.

70
00:03:28,271 --> 00:03:30,610
We've got a conference at travel
is about every six months.

71
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:32,590
We've got a new location for that.
Uh,

72
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:36,550
we've got really interesting fun games
cards, books, you can see them upstairs.

73
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:39,160
This was mentioned.
And of course we have our youtube channel,

74
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:42,710
which has about 3.7 million
subscribers today. Uh,

75
00:03:42,711 --> 00:03:44,140
and you should become one if you like.

76
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:47,230
And we put out about two videos a
week on different topics in emotional

77
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:48,064
intelligence.

78
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:51,190
So we like to bring our message in
lots of different ways and connect with

79
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:53,290
people in lots of different ways as well.

80
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,890
But I'd like to talk a little bit now
about what it is that we're doing with all

81
00:03:56,891 --> 00:03:59,470
of these different ways of talking
to people. What are we talking about?

82
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:02,620
What in other words is
emotional intelligence?

83
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:06,370
This is the really nice formal
definition that we tend to use.

84
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:10,810
Emotional intelligence is the quality
that enables us to confront with patients,

85
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,340
insight and imagination,

86
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,270
the many problems that we face in our
effective relationship with ourselves and

87
00:04:16,271 --> 00:04:19,420
others. And in this case effective
means having to do with emotions.

88
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,690
So another way I like to think about this
is that we're talking to people about

89
00:04:22,691 --> 00:04:26,410
how to navigate around their own emotions
more gracefully, more thoughtfully,

90
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,740
and also to connect with other people
and other people's emotions in a way

91
00:04:29,741 --> 00:04:31,450
that's more intelligent,
more insightful,

92
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,450
and ultimately more likely
to make things go well.

93
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,380
Now I know that this might sound
a little bit weird to some people.

94
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,270
Some people say that's just strange.
You know,

95
00:04:40,271 --> 00:04:44,110
it's like a little bit of woo magic,
whatever. Uh, maybe this is just a fad.

96
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:48,010
But actually we really think that this
is something that everyone understands a

97
00:04:48,011 --> 00:04:51,370
little bit intuitively because we can
talk about people we know who have maybe

98
00:04:51,371 --> 00:04:55,300
been very successful at things like
science or even maybe they've gotten quite

99
00:04:55,301 --> 00:04:58,030
wealthy in a particular area or they've
been a really good lawyer or something.

100
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,030
But their personal lives might
be a bit sad or a bit lonely.

101
00:05:01,031 --> 00:05:03,790
They might have screwed up a major
thing with their family or with a

102
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:08,200
relationship, or maybe they're just
very unimaginative or a little bit, uh,

103
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,710
demanding or cruel in a way that's not
very helpful to them in the long run.

104
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,970
And when this is the case,

105
00:05:12,971 --> 00:05:16,180
when someone's clearly very intelligent
in one area but isn't very good at

106
00:05:16,181 --> 00:05:18,160
navigating their own
emotions or relationships,

107
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,280
that person can be said to be
lacking in emotional intelligence.

108
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,550
So we all have something of an intuitive
sense of what it might mean to have

109
00:05:24,551 --> 00:05:29,200
emotional intelligence and
unfortunately sometimes to lack it. Um,

110
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:32,230
but I want to talk a little bit more
about what it is concretely that you learn

111
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:34,630
to do when you have emotional
intelligence and when you develop it.

112
00:05:34,631 --> 00:05:37,900
What exactly are you
learning? Um, first of all,

113
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:41,740
a major part of emotional intelligence
is some skepticism around our own

114
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:43,060
emotions.
In other words,

115
00:05:43,061 --> 00:05:45,790
that we're not going to believe
everything that we feel right away.

116
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:46,870
We might feel afraid,

117
00:05:46,871 --> 00:05:48,970
but we're going to be able to have
a little bit of distance and ask,

118
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,730
should I be afraid?
Right? Or, um, you know,

119
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,880
someone can come to us and we can have a
bit of skepticism about their emotions.

120
00:05:54,881 --> 00:05:58,040
They might be very angry and we're
able to have a little and say,

121
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,250
are they just an obnoxious person that's
always angry or are they really anxious

122
00:06:01,251 --> 00:06:03,890
about something right now?
And this is covering that over.

123
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,040
So we think it's very important to be
able to have a little bit of healthy

124
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:11,180
skepticism about why we're having the
motions were having and why other people

125
00:06:11,181 --> 00:06:13,010
are having the emotions they're having.

126
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,930
And we know this is a
bit counter cultural.

127
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,630
There are a lot of voices in the world
that say, you know, trust your instincts,

128
00:06:17,631 --> 00:06:20,570
go with your gut instincts. But
at the school of life, we say,

129
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,620
don't trust your instincts. They're
often rubbish, right? Not always,

130
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,960
but it's good to be able
to be skeptical about them.

131
00:06:26,961 --> 00:06:28,490
They can lead us very far astray.

132
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:32,000
And probably all of us has seen that in
our own lives or in the lives of someone

133
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,073
that we know.

134
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,010
The other thing we're very interested
in which is related and which we talk a

135
00:06:37,011 --> 00:06:38,090
lot about at the school of life,

136
00:06:38,091 --> 00:06:42,110
is that we talk a lot about being aware
of the way our past might be affecting

137
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:43,850
our current emotional responses.

138
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:47,570
So we say that emotional intelligence
involves recognition of the importance of

139
00:06:47,571 --> 00:06:49,460
our past and our childhood.
In particular,

140
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:52,340
you might recognize this if you've
ever been to therapy or even read about

141
00:06:52,341 --> 00:06:54,410
therapy because therapists
believe this as well,

142
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,980
and in particular they believe that
between the ages of zero and six,

143
00:06:57,981 --> 00:07:02,090
a lot of our emotional
apparatus or emotional hardware,
if you like, is formed.

144
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,910
It doesn't mean you can never change
and after the age of six of course,

145
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,040
but it's much, much harder in
the same way that it's much,

146
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:09,890
much harder for someone
to learn a language once
they're over the age of 20 or

147
00:07:09,891 --> 00:07:10,520
so.

148
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,090
Our minds are shaped a lot
by our childhood and they're
also shaped a lot by our

149
00:07:14,091 --> 00:07:14,421
past.

150
00:07:14,421 --> 00:07:17,720
If we had a very difficult experience
or even a very good one that's likely to

151
00:07:17,721 --> 00:07:19,340
affect how we see things in the future.

152
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:22,340
And while this isn't ideal
for a lot of reasons,

153
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,680
the most important thing is that
we can become conscious of it.

154
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,560
I also know that some people will be
skeptical about this. I'll say, you know,

155
00:07:27,561 --> 00:07:28,460
that's ridiculous.

156
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,790
I have a really nice linkedin profile
now and I look very professional and

157
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:34,910
serious and I'm an adult and I can
manage everything. Thank you very much,

158
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:37,700
Anne and I sympathize because
I sometimes feel that way too,

159
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:41,360
but I think we can see a little bit of
how our childhood might have affected us

160
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:43,550
when we get in high periods of stress,
right?

161
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,530
Or sometimes you can even
see when people get drunk.

162
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:48,410
There are moments when we kind of revert
back to our inner child is a bit like

163
00:07:48,411 --> 00:07:52,820
this, this is a child and this might be
his grown up version of himself. Right?

164
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:56,450
You can see this in people a little bit
when they're under a lot of pressure.

165
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,900
And so the point is that we're always
going to be acting in very immature ways,

166
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:03,020
but that we have the potential to do
so when there's a lot of pressure and

167
00:08:03,021 --> 00:08:06,500
therefore we need to become aware a
little bit more of what those ways of

168
00:08:06,501 --> 00:08:07,430
behaving might be.

169
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:10,280
We might have learned as a child that
people are not going to be very responsive

170
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,030
to our needs.

171
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:14,060
And actually it makes it very difficult
for us to work in a team once we're

172
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:15,140
under some stress.

173
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,740
So there are things like this about our
past that emotionally intelligent people

174
00:08:18,741 --> 00:08:22,310
tend to become more aware of and
navigate around to some degree.

175
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:27,590
Um, I want to talk now more a little bit
about how this works in the workplace,

176
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:32,690
right? So why is emotional intelligence
important at work? Um, well,

177
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:36,770
one of the reasons is actually very new.
This is a new period in human history.

178
00:08:36,771 --> 00:08:40,160
In terms of work. It's maybe always been
helpful to have emotional intelligence,

179
00:08:40,161 --> 00:08:41,510
but never more so than now.

180
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:45,380
And it's probably only going to get
more and more important and one of the

181
00:08:45,381 --> 00:08:48,440
reasons is because we're now
working so much more with our minds.

182
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:49,620
For most of human history,

183
00:08:49,621 --> 00:08:52,370
we were gathering nuts and fruits
and then suddenly we were farming,

184
00:08:52,371 --> 00:08:55,040
but that was pretty physical and maybe
then we built some pyramids and you,

185
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,660
we did a lot of physical labor,
but after that,

186
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,170
I'm only recently have we started working
in really, really complicated teams.

187
00:09:01,171 --> 00:09:04,050
Most people have started working in
ways that involve talking to people and

188
00:09:04,051 --> 00:09:07,050
convincing them and prioritizing
and managing their own emotions.

189
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:07,900
All of the sudden,

190
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:11,940
so much of our work is psychological and
so as a result at the school of life,

191
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:15,840
we believe that good business requires
good psychology and this is it.

192
00:09:15,841 --> 00:09:16,640
Something that's,
you know,

193
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,910
cute and nice and good to have and maybe
the HR team will do every once in a

194
00:09:19,911 --> 00:09:23,490
while. It's something that's crucial
every single day. It's not a luxury,

195
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,930
it's a necessity.
It's really,

196
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:28,620
really important because ultimately and
increasingly it's going to be the very

197
00:09:28,621 --> 00:09:31,020
thing that we work on.
Even if our technical skills are great,

198
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,830
this will determine whether you succeed
or don't do so well at the things that

199
00:09:34,831 --> 00:09:36,540
we're working on.
Again,

200
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:39,810
it's because we used to be doing things
like this and now all of the sudden

201
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,670
after thousands and thousands of years,

202
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,650
a lot of the most important
work in the world,

203
00:09:43,651 --> 00:09:46,620
a lot of the work that most of us
are doing looks more like that.

204
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,500
And that is very complicated.
That involves a lot of guessing,

205
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:52,890
maybe six or seven steps ahead,
how other people are likely to respond,

206
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,350
how we can persuade them,
how we can convince them,

207
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,970
how we can get along with them,

208
00:09:56,971 --> 00:10:01,020
how we can understand when we're wrong
and why that's very complicated emotional

209
00:10:01,021 --> 00:10:03,540
stuff.
So suddenly our work is psychological.

210
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:08,070
The quality of the work that we do is
now hugely dependent on our emotional

211
00:10:08,071 --> 00:10:10,500
states of mind.
And as a result,

212
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:14,280
we need to learn with modesty and courage
and insight how our emotional minds

213
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:18,080
work and why they so often don't quite.
Um,

214
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:21,600
in another way of thinking about this is
that the most complicated technologies

215
00:10:21,601 --> 00:10:24,870
on earth don't have anything to do with
all the nice things made here at Google.

216
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:27,930
They are the people in this
room and out there in the world,

217
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:31,290
we are the most complicated things and
we need to put ourselves as much as we

218
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:34,650
can, right? We need to
make sure it's working. Um,

219
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,320
so how do we do that?
That's a good question.

220
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:40,950
We'll talk to you a little bit about how
we teach emotional intelligence at the

221
00:10:40,951 --> 00:10:43,800
school of life. Um, some people say, well,

222
00:10:43,801 --> 00:10:45,360
what do you mean teaching
emotional intelligence?

223
00:10:45,361 --> 00:10:47,490
Isn't it just something that you
have where you don't have, right?

224
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,010
Either you're charming and you're
good with people and you're good at

225
00:10:50,011 --> 00:10:52,620
communicating and you're calmer, you're
not, and it's just what you're born with.

226
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:55,380
That's it. Why am I trying
to learn this now? Right?

227
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,870
But we completely disagree
at the school of life.

228
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:01,050
We actually think these are really
concrete skills. You can learn them,

229
00:11:01,051 --> 00:11:04,560
you can practice them and you can get
better at them until they become second

230
00:11:04,561 --> 00:11:06,720
nature. In a way. We'll talk
about nature more in a second.

231
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,630
And we're not the only people who have
believed this in the course of history.

232
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,730
Here's some funny people who
have definitely believed this.

233
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,770
These are French aristocrats in a salon,

234
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,370
and people like this were trained
for a long period of life, uh,

235
00:11:17,371 --> 00:11:19,410
to be more charming,
better communicators.

236
00:11:19,411 --> 00:11:22,050
They learned some funny things like how
to stand behind a chair in a charming

237
00:11:22,051 --> 00:11:24,840
way, right? But we also learned
how to persuade, how to convince,

238
00:11:24,841 --> 00:11:26,520
how to say no without giving offense.

239
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:29,610
And it's really not so much about the
concrete skills that they had because you

240
00:11:29,611 --> 00:11:31,470
might need different ones.
Now that you work here.

241
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:35,310
It's the idea that there are things that
seem natural but really took a lot of

242
00:11:35,311 --> 00:11:36,780
practice and training to get right.

243
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,610
There are things that can
make you more likable.

244
00:11:38,611 --> 00:11:41,250
There are things that can make you
succeed and do better in the world.

245
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,310
So we believe what these
guys believed in a way.

246
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,640
And we also believe what in general
is called the classical approach to

247
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:50,970
education, which is in contrast to
the romantic approach to education.

248
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:54,500
The romantic approach to education built
on the romantic movement to the 1800

249
00:11:54,501 --> 00:11:57,460
says, you know, human nature is
wonderful. Let's just have more of it.

250
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:58,990
All the things that humans
are already good at,

251
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,970
let's develop them and encourage them.

252
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,390
But actually we're very interested
in what you might call second nature,

253
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,460
the thing you develop afterward.
In other words,

254
00:12:06,461 --> 00:12:08,590
we're very interested in the
types of tools we can use,

255
00:12:08,591 --> 00:12:12,160
almost technologies we can use to improve
what otherwise wouldn't be natural for

256
00:12:12,161 --> 00:12:14,860
human beings and theorists
of classical education.

257
00:12:14,861 --> 00:12:18,280
Love to use the metaphor of the tool.
Or in this case it's a pulley, right?

258
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,970
Because no one by nature is fitted
to lift a heavy statue like that.

259
00:12:21,971 --> 00:12:25,480
That's a statue actually, that guy. Um,
but with the right tools you can do it.

260
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,000
And teaching emotional
intelligence is the same way.

261
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,240
You can basically develop
a new type of nature,

262
00:12:31,241 --> 00:12:33,100
a new type of ability
that you never had before.

263
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,010
And that wouldn't necessarily
come natural to you to begin with.

264
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,480
So that's what we're working on.

265
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,120
That'd be tell you a little
bit more about how we do that.

266
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,320
One of the things that we do,

267
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,530
and this is very important when
you're working in groups or an entire

268
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:48,700
organizations, is that we help to create
a culture of humility. This is really,

269
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,980
really important because otherwise what
happens is you bring people into the

270
00:12:50,981 --> 00:12:52,030
room and you're like,
well,

271
00:12:52,031 --> 00:12:54,760
you're the pessimistic one and you're
the problem and you're the one that's

272
00:12:54,761 --> 00:12:56,890
being really difficult than you're
the problem person in our team.

273
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:00,310
And then that person of course becomes
very defensive and Aaron else feels very

274
00:13:00,311 --> 00:13:01,960
self righteous and nobody learns anything.

275
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:05,500
So we work very hard to begin by saying
this thing that we're going to learn

276
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:08,080
today, whether it's about communication,
whether it's about playfulness,

277
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:11,590
is a problem and an opportunity for
every single one of us in this room.

278
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:15,550
All of us have this strange, quirky
thing about us that makes it difficult.

279
00:13:15,551 --> 00:13:19,270
Or in other words, we are all
crazy, right? We're all just nuts.

280
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,410
Barely holding it together.

281
00:13:20,411 --> 00:13:23,890
People some days and all of us need help
on this thing and it's actually really

282
00:13:23,891 --> 00:13:28,240
helpful if someone like the CEO can stand
up and be like, hello, I'm an idiot. Yes,

283
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:31,630
I'm an idiot. In the following ways,
it's good because first of all,

284
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,680
in most companies,

285
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,260
at least some people are already thinking
that the CEO is a bit of an idiot,

286
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:39,520
but it's actually really reassuring to
see someone like a CEO say, you know,

287
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm aware of my idiocy. It's not
escaped me. I'm, I'm working on it.

288
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,360
And that's true for all of us. We tried
to create a culture where people can say,

289
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,400
I know I have various eccentricities,
you know,

290
00:13:48,401 --> 00:13:49,810
I don't mean crazy of
course about mental health.

291
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:54,100
I mean human instability in general, but
I'm working on them. I understand them,

292
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:55,240
I know I'm not perfect.

293
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:58,520
That creates a really open culture in a
community and and then organization and

294
00:13:58,521 --> 00:13:59,354
then a team.

295
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,320
So we work very hard in the structure of
our workshops and then all the way that

296
00:14:02,321 --> 00:14:05,800
we present our materials to say this
is something everyone can work on,

297
00:14:05,801 --> 00:14:08,140
nobody's perfect at and
everybody can learn.

298
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,050
This really helps us
overcome defensiveness.

299
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:14,800
We want people to be open to the idea
and actually want to learn and learn new

300
00:14:14,801 --> 00:14:19,090
tools that can help them. Another thing
that we do, and this is very important,

301
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,340
is that we help people
not only learn but repeat,

302
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,910
learn over and over and over again and
practice over and over and over again.

303
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:28,270
The important skills that
we believe in because um,

304
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:31,810
a lot of education in the world tends to
think about sort of the human mind is a

305
00:14:31,811 --> 00:14:32,440
bucket.

306
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,550
Like you are going to spend maybe a day
or a week or a year pouring intimate

307
00:14:36,551 --> 00:14:39,070
information and then after a while you've
got it and it's in there and that's

308
00:14:39,071 --> 00:14:42,490
good and you're done and nothing else
is needed. And at the school of life,

309
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,460
especially around emotional skills,
we disagree completely.

310
00:14:45,461 --> 00:14:47,260
We think the human mind is really,
really fragile.

311
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:50,560
It forgets things really easily. It
means, well, you know, but it slips. Um,

312
00:14:50,561 --> 00:14:52,010
we think we be kind and generous.

313
00:14:52,011 --> 00:14:54,500
And that sounds really great in the moment
when you're listening to someone talk

314
00:14:54,501 --> 00:14:55,820
to you about it.
But then you know,

315
00:14:55,821 --> 00:14:58,460
an hour later you're hungry in two hours
later you have an email and you forget

316
00:14:58,461 --> 00:15:01,790
by the end of the day. So we really think
the human mind is a bit like a sieve,

317
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,410
right?
And as a result,

318
00:15:03,411 --> 00:15:06,200
we think that we need to repeat everything
to do with emotional intelligence

319
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:08,960
quite a bit. We need to practice
constantly. We need good reminders.

320
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:12,080
We need an interesting, intelligent,
sensitive, appealing reminders.

321
00:15:12,081 --> 00:15:15,140
Because no matter how wonderful we are,
it is going to slip through our minds.

322
00:15:15,141 --> 00:15:16,730
We are going to need to refresh.

323
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,550
We're not the only people that
believe this either, by the way.

324
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:22,490
Some of the very first teachers of
emotional intelligence, so to speak,

325
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:26,360
however flawed in other
ways. We're religions and
religions believe this as well.

326
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,490
They think that people need
to repeat all the time,

327
00:15:28,491 --> 00:15:30,350
that they need to be reminded
to be kind in the morning.

328
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,200
And then after lunch they
need to be reminded again
because they forgot over the

329
00:15:33,201 --> 00:15:35,540
course of lunch. Right? It's
not because people are bad.

330
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,280
They just recognize
this about human beings.

331
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:40,130
We need to be reminded constantly or
we're going to get home at the end of the

332
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,980
day and snap at our partners
and yell at our children. Um,

333
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,650
and so we kind of base some of
what we do on the structure of, um,

334
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,040
movements like this or a meditation,
things like that,

335
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,080
because we recognize the
value of that aspect.

336
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,200
The other thing we tried to do is
just make it interesting and engaging.

337
00:15:54,201 --> 00:15:57,500
We worked really hard to actually present
things in a way that people will say,

338
00:15:57,501 --> 00:15:59,390
yeah, that's right. That appeals to me.

339
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:02,330
You can see this a bit in our youtube
channel, of course, which is very popular,

340
00:16:02,331 --> 00:16:04,520
but also in the way that
we do our workshops.

341
00:16:04,521 --> 00:16:07,220
These are some funny slides from our
workshops and they just have really

342
00:16:07,221 --> 00:16:07,911
appealing quotes.

343
00:16:07,911 --> 00:16:11,420
They've interesting historical facts that
you're unlikely to forget. Strange art,

344
00:16:11,421 --> 00:16:14,960
like that funky art there at the
top, you know, um, good metaphors.

345
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:17,580
The point is we want it to stick in
the brain as long as possible before it

346
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:20,390
slides this SIF. So we're very,
very interested in beauty as well.

347
00:16:20,391 --> 00:16:24,320
We think beauty brings ideas to life and
that's true of course with these little

348
00:16:24,321 --> 00:16:25,400
products as well.

349
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:29,450
And all of this is designed ultimately
to help people be more aware of what

350
00:16:29,451 --> 00:16:31,010
they're like.
Um,

351
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:33,860
people don't need to be perfect at
the end of the day to be emotionally

352
00:16:33,861 --> 00:16:34,694
intelligent.

353
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:38,660
What they need to do most of all is to
be aware of the ways in which they are

354
00:16:38,661 --> 00:16:41,150
imperfect, to be able to
navigate a little bit better,

355
00:16:41,151 --> 00:16:42,740
to acknowledge when they
might've screwed up,

356
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:46,130
to look for places where they can improve.
That's the ultimate goal.

357
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,830
None of us will be perfect,
but all of us can be a bit better.

358
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,820
This has to do with self awareness.
We encourage all this regular reflection,

359
00:16:52,821 --> 00:16:53,780
these exercises,

360
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:58,310
they're all geared in some way towards
self awareness and rather than go on and

361
00:16:58,311 --> 00:16:59,240
on about self awareness,

362
00:16:59,241 --> 00:17:02,840
now I'm actually going to give you a
chance to try it out with one of our most

363
00:17:02,841 --> 00:17:05,810
popular exercises,
the philosophical meditation.

364
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:08,120
So I'd love to encourage you for a minute.
Um,

365
00:17:08,121 --> 00:17:10,700
it's good to write things down
during this exercise. So if you want,

366
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,350
you might get out something
that you write things down on.

367
00:17:12,351 --> 00:17:15,530
It's your phone or you know,
a little notebook or something like that.

368
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,930
And I'll explain a little
bit about this as well. Um,

369
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:25,380
a lot of traditional
meditation, especially the
way it's been brought in, uh,

370
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,720
to the West has to do with the
idea of trying to empty our minds.

371
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:33,380
And in the sounds that can imply that
maybe there's not anything that useful to

372
00:17:33,381 --> 00:17:35,270
know about the things that
are floating around in there.

373
00:17:35,271 --> 00:17:37,250
Maybe we don't need to
investigate them too much.

374
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,960
This is a bit of an overgeneralization.

375
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:42,200
I know there's very complicated different
strengths of meditation in the east,

376
00:17:42,201 --> 00:17:44,930
but the point is that we sometimes
lose the thread. We might think, oh,

377
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:48,710
what I need to do to calm down. It's just
not investigate the content of my mind.

378
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,500
But at the school of life we think
is actually really important.

379
00:17:52,501 --> 00:17:56,460
So rather than trying to empty the
mind or become more aware of our body,

380
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,140
although those things
can be useful for people,

381
00:17:58,141 --> 00:18:02,010
sometimes we're actually very interested
in things like downloading the mind and

382
00:18:02,011 --> 00:18:05,610
sorting through the feelings and ideas
that we have and interpreting the

383
00:18:05,611 --> 00:18:08,220
anxieties and hurts and
excitements that might be in there,

384
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:11,100
but which we haven't fully recognized
and interpreted for ourselves.

385
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,080
We're going to get a
chance to do that today,

386
00:18:13,081 --> 00:18:14,460
at least with one of these sections.

387
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,150
Maybe we'll start with anxiety because
my intuition is that most people have

388
00:18:18,151 --> 00:18:22,920
anxieties, a lot of anxieties
throughout the day. So first of all,

389
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,450
I might say that many
people do this a lot.

390
00:18:24,451 --> 00:18:26,850
Some people that come to the school
of life end up doing this regularly,

391
00:18:26,851 --> 00:18:30,270
maybe for even an hour or so. And it's a
good one to take home and try out again.

392
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,420
I like to say that our exercises
are a bit like Ikea furniture,

393
00:18:33,421 --> 00:18:36,270
so you can take them home with you and
then you kind of construct them in a good

394
00:18:36,271 --> 00:18:39,090
way for yourself there.
But we're just getting a taste now.

395
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:44,000
You're just getting the pieces now.
So these are the usual three Co, uh,

396
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:48,360
questions, uh, philosophical
meditation. What am I anxious about?

397
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:51,000
What am I upset about and
what am I excited about?

398
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,440
They're just good starting questions.

399
00:18:52,441 --> 00:18:55,410
They help us think about what's
going on in our life. Um,

400
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,810
and I'd love to suggest
that we start with this one.

401
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,640
What am I presently anxious about?

402
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:04,080
So I would suggest that you write down
for a minute or two, as many as you can,

403
00:19:04,081 --> 00:19:07,170
think of things that you're anxious
about. You can do shorthand. So no one,

404
00:19:07,171 --> 00:19:08,760
none of your colleagues know
what it means. You know,

405
00:19:08,761 --> 00:19:13,140
it might just say k where I might just
say 10 30 or something as much shorthand

406
00:19:13,141 --> 00:19:16,470
is you need. And then in a minute we'll
do a little bit more with that list.

407
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:18,933
Okay.

408
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:23,990
There's even some suggested categories
here at the top in case you're thinking

409
00:19:23,991 --> 00:19:28,310
of things and can't quite drum
sum up, work, relationships,

410
00:19:28,311 --> 00:19:32,300
family health, sex, money,
things I have to do.

411
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,310
Once you've written down a few,

412
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:42,370
you might just choose three and the
three are going to be the ones that you

413
00:19:42,371 --> 00:19:46,180
unpack maybe even too,
since it's a short talk, um,

414
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:49,150
and you're just going to begin
to unpack them a little bit.

415
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:53,020
It's kind of like separating
out the different strands
of thought that has to do

416
00:19:53,021 --> 00:19:56,050
with that topic. So there's a suggestion
here of how you might do that.

417
00:19:56,051 --> 00:19:57,280
Unpacking anxiety.

418
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,220
You might want to complete the following
sentences around each of those two

419
00:20:00,221 --> 00:20:02,920
things.
Let's say one of them has to do with um,

420
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,570
an argument that you
had with your partner.

421
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:07,930
So you would complete the
sentences in regards to that thing.

422
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,380
What I'm really afraid will happen is
then you'll think about is it that you're

423
00:20:11,381 --> 00:20:13,600
worried that the relationship
is getting worse?

424
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,360
Is it that you're worried
that there might be a breakup?

425
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:17,380
Is it that you're worried
that your needs won't be bad?

426
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:21,580
I'm kind of trying to be as
honest with yourself as possible.

427
00:20:21,581 --> 00:20:24,760
What is the underlying fear? It's not just
that fights are unpleasant, of course.

428
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,280
What ultimately might be the bad thing

429
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:33,880
after that, you might want to
consider what you want to do about it.

430
00:20:33,881 --> 00:20:36,400
Is there actually something that you
could do that would perhaps reduce the

431
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:39,370
anxiety or at least take the issue
further in a constructive way?

432
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,690
It's good to first figure out
what you're afraid of though.

433
00:20:41,691 --> 00:20:43,510
Sometimes people jump right to action,

434
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:47,470
but we need a little bit of skepticism
about the emotions before we can choose

435
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,520
actions wisely

436
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:57,410
and finally you can move on to the
point about reassurance. So it's con,

437
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:00,660
it's really containment and reassurance
by which we mean that you're not going

438
00:21:00,661 --> 00:21:03,090
to let the anxiety take over
your whole life and color.

439
00:21:03,091 --> 00:21:04,320
Everything else that's going on,

440
00:21:04,321 --> 00:21:07,690
you're going to begin to bring it
back down to scale. What is, you know,

441
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,840
the limit on this particular anxiety.

442
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:12,660
So the worst thing that can happen is
in some ways the limit you might think,

443
00:21:12,661 --> 00:21:15,780
okay, absolute worst case we
break up, that would be terrible.

444
00:21:15,781 --> 00:21:19,350
But I guess I would do this and that
case I could see my friends more.

445
00:21:19,351 --> 00:21:23,070
For some people this is very reassuring
because it contains the problem to scale

446
00:21:23,071 --> 00:21:26,400
that is perhaps smaller
than civil war. Right? Um,

447
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,730
we can also think about how you would
cope. That can often be very reassuring.

448
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,330
I would take baths, I would see my friends
more, I would complain to my parents,

449
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:37,200
whatever it is. Um, this is kind of silly
examples, but you probably have your own.

450
00:21:37,201 --> 00:21:39,450
So think a little bit about
how you might contain your,

451
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,450
your anxiety and maybe offer
yourself some reassurance.

452
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,920
And then in a minute if you like,

453
00:21:43,921 --> 00:21:47,250
you have a chance to just share with the
person next to you how this was for you.

454
00:21:47,251 --> 00:21:49,650
And if you like, you can share the
details. Of course you don't have to.

455
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,800
So in a minute I'll, I'll
open it up. When you're ready,

456
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,590
do turn to someone next to you
and just imagine how this was,

457
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,000
what did you get out of it?
If you'd like,

458
00:22:00,001 --> 00:22:02,970
you can share the details but you
don't have to and then we'll come back

459
00:22:02,971 --> 00:22:03,804
together in a few minutes.

460
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:34,740
[inaudible]

461
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:41,520
from just one or two people. What
that was like for you? Was it helpful?

462
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:45,360
What part of it was helpful? If anything
was helpful or if not, that's okay too.

463
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:48,870
Yeah, I think you've got a Mike,
can we bring it over? Thank you.

464
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:51,523
Yeah.

465
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:52,643
Great.
Hi.

466
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:56,390
I'm actually going to steal this
gentleman's appointment he made only with

467
00:22:56,450 --> 00:23:00,010
chatting. Um, it was
really beneficial. Um,

468
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:01,890
I took two to work on.

469
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:06,660
One was really beneficial because it
made me seem like my worries sort of. Um,

470
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:09,360
we're a bit insignificant and
I could just like move past it,

471
00:23:09,361 --> 00:23:12,590
but then one went really horrible,
so I just thought in some,

472
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:17,280
when you pick some worries it
can win. Uh, what, what, uh,

473
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:21,120
what I'm really afraid what happened
is that bit can get a bit horrible.

474
00:23:21,121 --> 00:23:23,220
Do you know what I mean?
Sometimes it can work both ways,

475
00:23:23,221 --> 00:23:27,330
but I think generally it's like a nice
beneficial way to work through it and

476
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,950
just be able to sort of like prioritize
and work through your words one by one.

477
00:23:31,951 --> 00:23:33,060
It's a really nice way of looking at it,

478
00:23:33,061 --> 00:23:35,790
which I think everyone in this
group maybe hadn't done before.

479
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:38,800
So it was nice to do it like that.
Yeah. And perhaps a second issue.

480
00:23:38,801 --> 00:23:42,390
There are other ways of thinking about it.
So it's certainly not a cure all,

481
00:23:42,391 --> 00:23:45,830
but nothing really is.
Thanks. Yeah. Thank you.

482
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:49,880
You begin to also look at the nice things
that are floating around in your mind,

483
00:23:49,881 --> 00:23:52,610
but don't get enough attention.
So in other words,

484
00:23:52,611 --> 00:23:55,910
we're thinking about how sometimes our
mind notices things and it really likes

485
00:23:55,911 --> 00:23:59,220
them and latches onto them for
a minute. But then you know, it,

486
00:23:59,221 --> 00:24:01,760
it forgets in by the end of the day,
you don't remember what it is.

487
00:24:01,761 --> 00:24:04,610
And actually you had a nice intuition
there, but you might lose it.

488
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:08,050
So these are rather exciting
thoughts. Um, or it might be the,

489
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:08,871
it's a little bit troubling.

490
00:24:08,871 --> 00:24:11,150
Sometimes we envy someone
that's not very comfortable,

491
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,870
but nevertheless the envious telling us
something about what we might actually

492
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:17,570
really like to do in the future.
So these are areas of excitement,

493
00:24:17,571 --> 00:24:18,470
things that give us a little,

494
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,660
they're a little bit appealing
to us for one reason or another.

495
00:24:20,661 --> 00:24:23,750
Things we'd really like to get
more into in our life perhaps.

496
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,400
And we need to learn to identify
the more so that we can, uh,

497
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,480
explore new positive things in our life.
So just for a minute, I'd love you to, um,

498
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,850
let's think about someone who made you
either excited, intrigued, or envious,

499
00:24:34,851 --> 00:24:37,010
which are all very interesting words.
You know,

500
00:24:37,011 --> 00:24:40,490
someone you thought other job is really
cool or their way of, uh, you know,

501
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:43,610
talking to me is really appealing or I'd
really like to have something that they

502
00:24:43,611 --> 00:24:45,710
have.
You don't have to question it too much.

503
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,540
You don't have to feel
guilty about feeling envious.

504
00:24:47,541 --> 00:24:49,940
Because the point here is to try
to take the thing that they have.

505
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:53,600
It's to try to think about what you
yourself might really be attracted to in

506
00:24:53,601 --> 00:24:56,180
life and that can be a really
helpful thing to know about yourself.

507
00:24:56,181 --> 00:25:00,800
Just for a minute. First things that
come to mind, even if it's a bit strange,

508
00:25:00,801 --> 00:25:01,700
isn't it?
Exercise.

509
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,780
You could also think about
really pleasant, interesting,

510
00:25:08,781 --> 00:25:10,760
unusual experiences you've had recently.

511
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:13,640
Maybe something that took you by surprise
because it was nicer than you thought

512
00:25:13,641 --> 00:25:16,730
it would be. That's more comfortable, but
I've given you the hard task first. Now,

513
00:25:16,731 --> 00:25:21,080
the easy task, what was really
appealing, what was really nice recently,

514
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:30,160
once you've written down some of these
hints as to your future interests,

515
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,950
you might begin to unpack them.
So you might think about, well,

516
00:25:32,951 --> 00:25:34,300
now that I've met this person,

517
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,230
what's something that I
might want to explore more or
try more or do differently?

518
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,890
Or if I wanted to get more experiences
like the one that surprised me by being

519
00:25:41,891 --> 00:25:43,810
so nice,
what might I need to do?

520
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:50,770
The last little section here
says plans from excitement.

521
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:54,430
It's bed tricky because
it's really thinking about
what you could concretely do

522
00:25:54,431 --> 00:25:54,941
in your life,

523
00:25:54,941 --> 00:25:59,080
like little actual attainable steps that
you could act on as a result of this

524
00:25:59,081 --> 00:25:59,914
excitement.

525
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:03,370
And perhaps the nicest thing
to do is maybe talk to the
other person next to you.

526
00:26:03,371 --> 00:26:06,060
Just talk to someone slightly different.
Um,

527
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:10,000
and each of you for a few minutes talk
about what your plans for your excitement

528
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:13,870
might be. What could you do as a result
of this interesting moment that you had?

529
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,390
So just for a few minutes,
talk to the other person,

530
00:26:16,391 --> 00:26:17,650
the other side of you or you know,

531
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:22,420
slightly switch your partners and think
about what kinds of plans could you make

532
00:26:22,421 --> 00:26:23,920
in response to this excitement.

533
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,390
Let's share a few,
if you don't mind,

534
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,990
I'd really love to hear
some of your friends,

535
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:43,440
some of your plans from excitement.
I can yell more loudly with

536
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:46,570
like triangle and a gong,
but

537
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,980
let's come back together.
You don't mind?

538
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,083
Yeah.

539
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:59,370
Does anyone have a plan from excitement
that they'd really love to share?

540
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:03,730
Something that came up that you could do?

541
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:08,950
No. A moment. That was very exciting.

542
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:13,640
Oh,
Yup.

543
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:20,180
Um, I will definitely apply for another
internship at Google. Excellent.

544
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,793
What else?

545
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:30,910
I think it was a little bit of difficulty
to define what would be the unusual

546
00:27:30,921 --> 00:27:35,340
experience that gets you excited or a
person that gets you extremely excited.

547
00:27:35,341 --> 00:27:40,010
Like to me there was nothing
that's extremely exciting
last time that you can't

548
00:27:40,011 --> 00:27:43,220
stand yourself kind of excitement.
That's moderately exciting.

549
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:46,910
But that's the thing. I was only
thinking when I read excitement.

550
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:51,170
I'm thinking of that extreme and like I
couldn't remember anything that's in the

551
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,003
last year probably,

552
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,010
but that does not mean that there
weren't probably smaller things.

553
00:27:55,011 --> 00:27:58,490
They just wouldn't come to your mind
because you never registered them as

554
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,690
exactly like it. It's sometimes hard
for us. We lose track of them. Right?

555
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,260
We often like to say that you should
maybe keep a journal and then the point

556
00:28:06,261 --> 00:28:09,650
isn't to say beautiful, elaborate things.
Every sentence. It's to just take note.

557
00:28:09,651 --> 00:28:12,200
Like that was quite interesting
this morning before you forget.

558
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:15,200
Otherwise we have less data
available to us effectively.

559
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,490
Really the point here isn't that this
is the only thing we did is called life.

560
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:22,240
It's rather than, it's just one of
many, many, many things that we do here.

561
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:25,340
The philosophical meditation.
And the point is that as you mentioned,

562
00:28:25,341 --> 00:28:29,090
we have a lot of unthought thoughts and
unfelt feelings and they can elude us,

563
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:30,950
but we need time to reflect on them.

564
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:34,940
Mental good health requires us to
constantly download our minds and sort out

565
00:28:34,941 --> 00:28:35,774
their contents.

566
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:39,380
And once these things become a little
bit easier to identify the fears and

567
00:28:39,381 --> 00:28:40,520
resentments and hopes,

568
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:43,460
then it can be a little bit
easier to understand them and be,

569
00:28:43,461 --> 00:28:47,210
become calmer and less resentful and
clearer ultimately about what we want in

570
00:28:47,211 --> 00:28:48,044
life.

571
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,073
MMM.

572
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:50,720
At this point, I'd love to, first of all,

573
00:28:50,721 --> 00:28:53,180
thank you for coming and sticking with
it even though it's a bit strange.

574
00:28:53,181 --> 00:28:56,350
I know some of it. Um, and I'd
also love to say that, you know,

575
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:00,280
if you have any questions,
I'm not free and I can answer them or um,

576
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:05,460
take comments too. Um, so
we were just talking. Yeah.

577
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:10,160
And I was wondering really
in terms of, um, practicing,

578
00:29:10,161 --> 00:29:14,750
you were mentioning that earlier in
terms of that excitement meditation,

579
00:29:14,751 --> 00:29:16,250
the philosophical meditation.
Yeah.

580
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:20,540
Do you think that we should be doing
that kind of regularly? Is that yes.

581
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,840
Yeah. Cause it's easy to sit
there and go, oh, you know,

582
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:27,410
carry on for two years and then go, oh,
now I need to be assessed in my life.

583
00:29:27,411 --> 00:29:30,350
But sometimes, yeah, I think
it's much more useful. I mean,

584
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:32,000
it's nice that we've
had tastes of it here,

585
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,500
but it's even more useful
as you practice it.

586
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,740
Just like with eastern meditation also,
right? People get better quote unquote,

587
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:39,770
and meditating, it becomes more
beneficial to them. And in the same way,

588
00:29:39,771 --> 00:29:43,720
the more that we start taking note these
little bits of anxiety and excitement

589
00:29:43,721 --> 00:29:45,160
and upset and so on,

590
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:48,220
the more likely we are to kind
of generate these very long list.

591
00:29:48,221 --> 00:29:49,180
We can look through and say,
oh look,

592
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:51,250
these things that have excited me
are related to each other. You know,

593
00:29:51,251 --> 00:29:56,110
are there similar, I tend to
be very excited when I have
spontaneous experiences,

594
00:29:56,111 --> 00:29:58,750
but I don't let myself do that
very much. So we, the more,

595
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:01,450
the more that we practice it, probably
the more we'll get out of it for sure.

596
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:06,950
Hi. Yes. Um, uh, you
briefly touched on this,

597
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:12,070
but I was just wondering what you think
about should this kind of stuff be

598
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:16,640
taught more formally in school? Cause
I know when I was in school, yeah,

599
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:21,670
the focus is entirely academic or
athletic and so only kids who excelled in

600
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:28,470
those things like felt good about
themselves. Um, and there were kids that,

601
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:30,860
lots of other talents
and yet we're kind of

602
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:33,160
so they think that in the future.
Um,

603
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:37,410
we've got a whole section in our blog
actually in our book of life where we talk

604
00:30:37,411 --> 00:30:41,770
about sort of Utopia and um, we talk
about the utopia of education and how, um,

605
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,330
much more of our time probably in the
education system could be well spent

606
00:30:45,331 --> 00:30:48,630
learning some of these
things and practicing some
of these things because first

607
00:30:48,631 --> 00:30:50,760
of all,
like sieves rather than buckets.

608
00:30:50,761 --> 00:30:53,140
We forget a lot of the information
that's given to us in school.

609
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,760
There's so many things we just don't
remember. Um, but second of all,

610
00:30:56,761 --> 00:31:00,300
because information is constantly
more and more available to us,

611
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:03,000
but the ability to regulate our own
emotions, that takes a lot of time.

612
00:31:03,001 --> 00:31:06,780
You've really got to invest in it and
we'd love to see it more widely available,

613
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:09,540
especially children and young people,
but also to older people.

614
00:31:09,541 --> 00:31:12,240
We can all learn together like 70 year
olds and seven year olds can be learning

615
00:31:12,241 --> 00:31:14,310
this together actually maybe
in a really useful way.

616
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:18,970
Um, I get really frustrated when I feel
like people don't have any emotional

617
00:31:18,971 --> 00:31:19,870
intelligence.
Yeah.

618
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:23,510
Cause I feel like I've got a lot
of it and I request I filled out.

619
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:27,070
I need that from other people.
How would you suggest that?

620
00:31:27,071 --> 00:31:30,160
I try not to get frustrated
in those situations.

621
00:31:30,161 --> 00:31:32,730
What advice would you give me for
dealing with people that you know,

622
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,330
would see this and they'd be like,
I don't want to go to that talk.

623
00:31:34,331 --> 00:31:35,560
I'm not interested.
Or you know,

624
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:38,800
they try or you try and explain how you
feel and they're just not interested

625
00:31:38,801 --> 00:31:39,940
because they don't understand it.

626
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:44,140
Well, first of all, in general about anger
at the school of life and frustration,

627
00:31:44,141 --> 00:31:49,030
we tend to say that, um, uh, our, our
anger is equivalent to our expectations,

628
00:31:49,031 --> 00:31:50,530
right.
If we have very high expectations,

629
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:53,440
probably they're going to disappoint some
of the time and then our anger will be

630
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,600
very intense as well.
So frankly,

631
00:31:55,601 --> 00:31:58,840
we believe in what we call strategic
pessimism and not just at work,

632
00:31:58,841 --> 00:32:00,070
but in general around people.

633
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,920
They are going to disappoint quite a
bit of the time and it's actually very

634
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,970
helpful to lower our expectations
a little bit to practice. Um,

635
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,070
we really like Seneca,

636
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:10,360
who's a philosopher and he said that you
should get up in the morning and have a

637
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:12,910
prayer meditation where you think about
all the things that could go wrong

638
00:32:12,911 --> 00:32:14,530
during the day.
And there's a lot of them.

639
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:17,170
And the nice thing isn't that at the end
you feel horribly anxious, hopefully,

640
00:32:17,171 --> 00:32:18,700
but that over time you realize,
okay,

641
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:21,370
well most of these people didn't go to
the emotional intelligence talk and said

642
00:32:21,371 --> 00:32:23,920
really ridiculous emotionally
unintelligent things in the meeting.

643
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,480
But this person actually
said a nice thing.

644
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,900
So it allows us to be less
angry and perhaps less upset,

645
00:32:28,901 --> 00:32:32,620
but also to appreciate more when things
do go well. That's a starting point.

646
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:33,820
And also you can give them,
you know,

647
00:32:33,821 --> 00:32:38,170
secret gift certificates to the school of
life or something. But thank you. Yeah,

648
00:32:38,171 --> 00:32:41,610
of course. So thank you for the dog. Yeah.

649
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:44,770
There is this thing called [inaudible],

650
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:48,370
which is basically I could test
for emotional intelligence. Yeah.

651
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:52,060
So what do you think of it as a way
of measuring emotional intelligence?

652
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:56,680
Um, I mean people have made a lot
of tests for this. Uh, it's not,

653
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:59,560
it's not for me to go and
evaluate that particular test. Um,

654
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,210
in general at the school of life,

655
00:33:01,211 --> 00:33:03,550
we like to test a little bit
more like taking your pulse.

656
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,430
It's a little bit more human sized and
also people change a lot, you know,

657
00:33:06,431 --> 00:33:09,220
and some of these tests might be
more credible than other ones.

658
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:12,580
So we tend to think it's more useful
if your thinking about your emotional

659
00:33:12,581 --> 00:33:15,040
intelligence rather than if we're telling
you from the outside like this is your

660
00:33:15,041 --> 00:33:17,020
level of emotional intelligence.
Um,

661
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:19,630
but we do have little tests and
diagnostics you can do for yourself.

662
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,760
And that's a bit more, it's
less like saying, you know,

663
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:24,070
this is your likelihood of a heart attack.
And it's more like saying,

664
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:27,580
why don't you take your pulse?
What's your pulse like right now? Um,

665
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:31,120
so that tends to be our approach to
diagnostics I would say. But you know,

666
00:33:31,121 --> 00:33:32,830
it's nice. Other people are
doing other things I guess.

667
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,560
So you contrast your
approach quite traumatic,

668
00:33:36,561 --> 00:33:41,020
d two regular mindfulness where you
tried to suppress or abstract away from

669
00:33:41,021 --> 00:33:44,170
emotions and kind of, yeah.
Can you elaborate a little bit?

670
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,500
What are the strengths and
weaknesses of each approach?

671
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,860
Yeah, I mean I, I'm not an expert
in eastern mindfulness so I,

672
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:55,300
I'm going to have to kind of
put that enormous background,
but I'm saying now, um,

673
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,930
some of the types of meditation
that are very common in the west,

674
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:03,160
which had been through a very complicated
process, translated from much older,

675
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:05,290
sometimes religious techniques,
um,

676
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:08,410
tend to allow us to empty our mind in
the sense that they don't focus on the

677
00:34:08,411 --> 00:34:11,140
content of the worry so much
as they ask you to release it.

678
00:34:11,141 --> 00:34:13,540
And that can be a very good thing.
Um,

679
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,450
but one of the reasons we're interested
in examining the contents of the mind is,

680
00:34:16,451 --> 00:34:20,020
are interested in psychology. And
Psychoanalysis and philosophy. Um,

681
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:23,400
I think there's space for both in the
world and one of the ways that there's

682
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:27,130
particularly space for both is that it's
important in general to interrogate our

683
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:29,560
anxieties and our excitement.
But we can't hold onto them forever.

684
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:33,010
And some of them are not immediately
fixable, like global warming.

685
00:34:33,011 --> 00:34:34,030
We can all do a little bit,
but you know,

686
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:36,940
if we sit all day long thinking about the
worst case scenario for global warming,

687
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:37,990
we're going to have a hard time.

688
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:42,430
So I think the goal is to be able to
sort out from our anxieties, you know,

689
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,530
this one about my relationship
where I have some,

690
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:47,560
some way of learning and understanding
more and then doing better.

691
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,920
I'm going to really investigate first
and maybe this other one where I can't

692
00:34:50,921 --> 00:34:54,310
really do anything or I'm
a more intelligent approach
will make any difference

693
00:34:54,311 --> 00:34:56,050
because I don't have the
power in that situation.

694
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,780
That might be a really good space.
And mindfulness,

695
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:01,000
eastern mindfulness has a lot
of other benefits, which again,

696
00:35:01,001 --> 00:35:04,750
I'm not an expert on but are, are
separate as well. Does that make sense?

697
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:09,070
It's kind of about how much you need to
think about the thing to do better at it

698
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,450
versus where it won't help.

699
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:16,630
In the beginning you mentioned that you
recommend to be skeptical of your own

700
00:35:16,671 --> 00:35:20,780
emotions and also other people's
emotions. Yeah. Uh, but on the other hand,

701
00:35:20,781 --> 00:35:23,360
we have to be careful not to
dismiss other people's feelings.

702
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:27,380
When someone comes to me and says they're
anxious, then I don't want to say,

703
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:29,600
let's see.
It's a reason why it shouldn't be anxious.

704
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:34,250
Don't think you ain't just to, how do
you strike the balance between this?

705
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:38,180
Well, this sounds like it's
mostly about people's, um,

706
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:41,010
not kind of telling people what they're
feeling, which I think is very important.

707
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:45,930
So I think the idea is more to open up
possibilities before we choose an action

708
00:35:45,931 --> 00:35:47,700
rather than to tell the other
person that they're feeling.

709
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:50,970
Like if a person comes to us and
they're very angry at us, um,

710
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:55,010
it's probably more helpful for
us to first ask, you know, um,

711
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,290
maybe some, some mitigating
circumstances like, oh,

712
00:35:58,291 --> 00:35:59,520
this person's under a lot of stress.

713
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:01,560
This allows me to be slightly
more patient with them.

714
00:36:01,561 --> 00:36:04,260
Or maybe this person is anxious about a
thing I haven't even thought about and I

715
00:36:04,261 --> 00:36:05,340
don't know about it home.

716
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,730
It's not that we then tell them this is
the situation is that we're almost able

717
00:36:08,731 --> 00:36:12,120
to be more curious and ask them and not
immediately judge and rush to action.

718
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,530
Does that make sense?

719
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,653
Yeah.

720
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,390
Hello? Hi. You were mentioning at the
beginning of the talk defensiveness.

721
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,320
Defensiveness.
Yeah.

722
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:25,970
And I was just wondering if you are
dealing with people who are extremely

723
00:36:25,971 --> 00:36:30,380
defensive and you, you can see that it's
coming from a place of anxiety or fear,

724
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:35,360
um, what would your advice to, what
is the best approach in your opinion?

725
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:39,340
Oh, I mean, there's lots of different
techniques for dealing with defensiveness.

726
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:42,580
The main thing, first of all, is to deal
with our own defensiveness. It's very,

727
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,660
you know, our school is about changing
ourselves more than other people. Um,

728
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:50,170
I think the other thing is to remember
that we're defensive because we often

729
00:36:50,171 --> 00:36:53,410
think that our value is attached to
the criticism the person is making.

730
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:56,470
So we talk a lot, um, in our classes,

731
00:36:56,471 --> 00:37:00,340
especially in our classes around work
that we want to make the criticisms as we

732
00:37:00,341 --> 00:37:02,560
have them enormously local,
right?

733
00:37:02,561 --> 00:37:05,140
So it's that it's very clear to
the person as much as possible.

734
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:08,020
This isn't about their value as a
human being or even necessarily whether

735
00:37:08,021 --> 00:37:11,230
they're good at their job. It's just
this particular paper online three.

736
00:37:11,231 --> 00:37:13,240
I wonder if we could make
it a little bit more acts.

737
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:17,360
So one of the things we work on doing is
making criticisms very, very local, um,

738
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:20,560
because the fear of a person
who's defensive is that
their whole being is being

739
00:37:20,561 --> 00:37:21,840
judged.
Um,

740
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:25,120
it's also very good to choose the time
and place and manner where you give

741
00:37:25,121 --> 00:37:27,090
criticism and sometimes it's
easier to give it, you know,

742
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:29,980
out for coffee if you've already had a
nice chat and there's lots of other ways,

743
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:33,250
but that's a good starting point sometimes
to make it very local and to watch it

744
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,090
in ourselves too.

745
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:41,390
I feel a bit like I've seen some of
an Ikea catalog. Yeah, definitely.

746
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:46,090
That's why you've seen 100%. It's right
here. [inaudible] just like, what's the,

747
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:49,750
what's your next suggested action
as it like signing up for a class,

748
00:37:49,751 --> 00:37:52,270
buying a book.
All those things are good.

749
00:37:52,271 --> 00:37:55,240
We like to do things in
many different formats. Um,

750
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,100
it really depends on what you need.

751
00:37:57,101 --> 00:37:58,510
I can also talk to you
afterwards if you're like, well,

752
00:37:58,511 --> 00:38:00,970
this is the thing I'm most interested in.
Um,

753
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,640
because we know people benefit from
different things depending on what,

754
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,970
what they're facing. Um, I
love our workshops and classes.

755
00:38:06,971 --> 00:38:10,240
I think they're really interesting because
you get to see not just what you're

756
00:38:10,241 --> 00:38:12,700
working with but what other people
are thinking about and going through.

757
00:38:12,701 --> 00:38:17,560
And that is particularly valuable
for me. I really enjoy that, um,

758
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:21,340
mark yet, but maybe some will be scheduled
and also they happen in our Bloomsbury

759
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:22,750
classrooms so you can
kind of go and get it.

760
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,960
A taster of some of our business workshops
and also some of our public classes.

761
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:28,060
But yeah, it is, it's an Ikea catalog.

762
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,190
The whole school of life
in 40 minutes is tough.

763
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:36,070
Yeah. I think I was just going to ask
a similar question. Um, how could,

764
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:36,550
you know,

765
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:41,050
we talked about individuals but also
maybe getting our team to be more aware of

766
00:38:41,051 --> 00:38:42,400
their own emotional intelligence.

767
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:46,300
Do you do team building
exercises along that front? Yes.

768
00:38:46,301 --> 00:38:50,050
Some of our are about sort of what does
our team need to do in order to do this

769
00:38:50,051 --> 00:38:54,610
or um, some are quite useful in terms of
like allowing the whole group to reflect

770
00:38:54,611 --> 00:38:58,210
together and come up with ideas
and suggestions together. So yeah,

771
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:01,180
it varies in the topic of course,
how individual versus team built, but

772
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,213
Yup.

773
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,090
Just checking the time. I think
it's 57. Maybe one more question.

774
00:39:08,091 --> 00:39:11,870
I see people are starting to leave. I'll
be here after as well if you have time.

775
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:16,610
Okay. Okay. Thank you
very much for having us.
