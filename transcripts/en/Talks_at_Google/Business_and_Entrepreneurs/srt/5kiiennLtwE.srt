1
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:09,590
I'm Daniel g, the boring part is I'm a
lawyer at a law firm called Sheridan's.

2
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,590
The exciting part is I do
football for my living,

3
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:17,620
which is actually quite cool and
going back very briefly and to um,

4
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,340
literally all the times that
I used to go to unfilled, um,

5
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:25,580
as a Liverpool fund with how back
in the day, um, as all you guys are,

6
00:00:25,581 --> 00:00:27,140
I'm sure some football funds,

7
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:32,120
the things that I always did when I was
a six year old and Stellar's a 37 year

8
00:00:32,121 --> 00:00:35,870
old do is talk about football all day
long if it's in the office or if it's

9
00:00:35,871 --> 00:00:39,200
actually after on the whatsapp chat cause
he gets rid of knowing on whatsapp as

10
00:00:39,201 --> 00:00:42,140
well. Actually if a result
is gone good or bad. Um,

11
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,580
but ultimately the truth is with the
loss of the work that I've done is from a

12
00:00:46,581 --> 00:00:47,780
very early age.

13
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:52,070
What I actually wants to do was talk
about football and I've been lucky enough

14
00:00:52,071 --> 00:00:56,390
and you'll hopefully see the career
journey to a degree about why and how I

15
00:00:56,391 --> 00:01:01,340
manage to convert myself from
um, uh, regulations lawyer,

16
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:05,090
which doesn't sound as sexy to a
football lawyer, which sounds a bit sexy,

17
00:01:05,091 --> 00:01:09,110
but all it is is a regulations
lawyer in football. Um,

18
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:13,400
and what I wanted to also talk about
firstly as a little bit about my journey,

19
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:18,150
but as importantly, um, the type
of stuff that I do day to day. Um,

20
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,410
and the very nice, um,
impact that my book,

21
00:01:21,411 --> 00:01:24,440
which has just come out
recently has had on that.

22
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:29,180
Now apart from my mum being very excited
about the book being published, um,

23
00:01:29,181 --> 00:01:32,570
it's been, it's thankfully been
quite well received so far.

24
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,230
And what I want to try and talk about
in a little bit of detail or some of the

25
00:01:36,231 --> 00:01:38,510
sort of myths that I try
and dispel in the book.

26
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,840
Usually the first thing that most of my
friends and even my family still ask me

27
00:01:43,941 --> 00:01:46,280
is actually what do you
do as a football lawyer?

28
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:49,130
So what is it that you
do that pays the bills?

29
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:53,210
That's cool enough to say that you're
a football lawyer and I'm working the

30
00:01:53,211 --> 00:01:57,800
football industry doing so. Um,
very briefly it is as follows,

31
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,180
on a day to day basis,
I tend to work with players and agents.

32
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,520
So that is what I do.
Um,

33
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:09,770
that tends traditionally to be behind a
computer, but very often is on what's up,

34
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:10,340
um,

35
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:14,870
is on my phone is on voice messages that
come to me sometimes at four o'clock in

36
00:02:14,871 --> 00:02:15,620
the morning.

37
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:20,000
So I'll give you one just brief example
of what happened to me the day before

38
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,820
transfer deadline day.
So Wednesday evening,

39
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,360
I won't obviously disclosed
con confidential stuff,

40
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:31,010
but just to give you a flavor of what
tends to happen very often is a message

41
00:02:31,011 --> 00:02:34,250
will come to me from a client that
may be a club or a player, an agent.

42
00:02:34,251 --> 00:02:37,970
Usually it's an agent or a club saying,
um, right this, this is happening,

43
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,920
a deals happening on this particular day.

44
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,740
We need just to have a look quick look
through the documents is always what they

45
00:02:42,741 --> 00:02:44,630
say.
And um,

46
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:49,400
that happened actually at
1:45 AM on Thursday morning,

47
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:52,910
uh, done. There's a deal that's happening.
You need to go on a train somewhere.

48
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,520
You need to get to the
meeting for lunchtime,

49
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,520
try and conclude the deal in the afternoon
and then hopefully everything we'd

50
00:02:58,521 --> 00:03:02,410
done before, um, deadline
day concludes, um,

51
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,750
on that type of stuff
happens very regularly.

52
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:09,550
The other cool element that
happens quite regularly is when I,

53
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,473
um,

54
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:15,070
when I tend to know information
that nobody else knows,

55
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,110
which obviously is very cool,

56
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,650
but I need to be extremely careful
about telling anybody this,

57
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,130
especially because my family are the
biggest Blubba miles of all time as well.

58
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,300
And it happens because I did a
Liverpool transfer over the summer.

59
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:32,980
I knew a lot of cool stuff that was
going on and couldn't tell anybody.

60
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:37,870
I'm the brilliant thing about
it also was it was that him,

61
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,470
he was asking me about particular
deals that were going on.

62
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,820
I couldn't even, I couldn't even deny
the existence of what was going on.

63
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:48,640
So for about a week and a half,
I couldn't even reply to him.

64
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,720
So he thought I was just being annoying,
not replying to the General um,

65
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,780
uh, rumor mill that was going on, Joanie.

66
00:03:55,781 --> 00:03:58,870
But it was actually because one of the
players that I was working with was going

67
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:01,810
to be signing a deal with Liverpool and
I couldn't even tell my dad obviously,

68
00:04:01,811 --> 00:04:04,180
which is very important because
he obviously wants to know the,

69
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:06,850
the Gos and what's going on generally.
But needless to say,

70
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:08,260
as soon as the deal happened,

71
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:12,670
I could then tell my dad's and my rest
of my family who had no idea what was

72
00:04:12,671 --> 00:04:13,240
going on.

73
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,640
But I still couldn't tell them anything
interesting about what happened in the

74
00:04:15,641 --> 00:04:18,750
deal. Cause obviously it's
confidential too. So the,

75
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,940
the type of stuff that I tend to do is
unfortunately and the glamorous sizes,

76
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,070
great. You're working with so many
fantastic players with great clubs,

77
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,570
they're spending lots of money.

78
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,960
It is without doubt the most terribly
stressful hours of my life on a regular

79
00:04:35,381 --> 00:04:35,891
basis.

80
00:04:35,891 --> 00:04:40,780
When the window is cropping up or
finishing or concluding because you,

81
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,190
you are managing risk on one sense you
want to make sure that the deal completes

82
00:04:45,191 --> 00:04:47,890
because you don't want to be at blame
if it's anything to do with you.

83
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,460
You are still trying to communicate
quite difficult legal concepts to your

84
00:04:51,461 --> 00:04:55,120
clients to explain what the risk
is of particular things happening.

85
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,550
And at the same time also, um, you're
trying to make sure that um, uh,

86
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:03,340
you are being proactive. You're
thinking about solutions and things.

87
00:05:03,341 --> 00:05:04,460
Generally I'm,

88
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:08,500
I'll going to plan and that you want to
look unruffled and looking and ruffled

89
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:11,380
and feeling unruffled are two
quite different things at times.

90
00:05:11,381 --> 00:05:16,150
So that's just a very brief way of
background as to what I actually do day to

91
00:05:16,151 --> 00:05:20,920
day. So about meat. We've had the
intro, this is where it all began,

92
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,770
is the truth. So, uh,

93
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:27,460
my seat was just above the
director's box about there.

94
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:28,990
And as you can imagine,

95
00:05:28,991 --> 00:05:33,280
there's this big pole that got
in the way of the goal basically,

96
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:38,740
which is a problem. So me and my bro had
to, uh, ultimate games have to swap seats.

97
00:05:38,741 --> 00:05:41,680
So one of us could see the main goal
and one of us couldn't for a particular

98
00:05:41,681 --> 00:05:44,590
game, which worked out well.
Now this is the old stadium,

99
00:05:44,591 --> 00:05:47,410
so it's now come to leave the stadium.
So it's, it's slightly better.

100
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:53,500
How did I get involved in football?
So very briefly,

101
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:58,650
what happened in law school at
university was the, um, I asked,

102
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:02,270
my tutor lets you off the cuff,
can I write about the Bozeman ruling?

103
00:06:02,271 --> 00:06:07,220
And the Bozeman ruling was John, what
Bozeman back in the day in 1990, um,

104
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,720
wasn't allowed to transfer to a new
club after the end of his contract,

105
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:15,440
after it even expired.
And that started a very big landmark case,

106
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:19,850
which five years later actually resulted
in what's called the free movement of

107
00:06:19,851 --> 00:06:24,320
players across Europe, which meant that
after a player's contract had finished,

108
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,190
they could move on a free transfer
and the selling club couldn't,

109
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:31,730
didn't have to demand it and couldn't
demand the transfer fee. So I thought,

110
00:06:31,731 --> 00:06:35,420
what a brilliant thing to possibly
in third year uni write about,

111
00:06:35,421 --> 00:06:39,440
which was the bosom and
ruling the transfer system
changing and how things would

112
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:43,010
work. And they let me write about
it, which is even better after that,

113
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,150
I actually just tried to
persuade my dad's, um,

114
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,810
for me to spend an extra year at uni,

115
00:06:47,811 --> 00:06:51,080
which he was happy for me to do if I
did something interesting. I did a,

116
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:53,840
a master's in football
broadcasting rights.

117
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,230
It didn't sound as interesting because
actually underpinning it was competition

118
00:06:57,231 --> 00:07:00,320
law, which obviously is not quite
as sexy as football law. Uh,

119
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:04,250
but at the same time meant that I could
spend best part of about nine or 10

120
00:07:04,251 --> 00:07:08,480
months writing about how broadcasting
rights are sold across Europe,

121
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,590
which is cool.

122
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,380
And it meant that I could go out to the
real world for one more year before I

123
00:07:13,381 --> 00:07:17,630
had to stop working. As
a result of that. Um,

124
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,220
master's degree had little bit
spare time at the end of the A,

125
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:24,290
which actually meant that my tutor said
to me instead of actually just slacking

126
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:28,370
off, why don't you write in a couple of
law journals about the things that you've

127
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,970
written about? Great. Okay, I'll do
that. Didn't think anything would happen,

128
00:07:31,971 --> 00:07:33,950
but in a fantastic way.
They money,

129
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,770
they were happy to publish something
about the football industry,

130
00:07:36,771 --> 00:07:39,830
which was broadcasting rights
and about club ownership.

131
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:43,370
The entertainment law review at the time
published those two articles and a few

132
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:47,170
in a few months spells. But what's
actually realized afterwards that as,

133
00:07:47,171 --> 00:07:49,940
as well as it was great for my ego.
Fantastic.

134
00:07:49,941 --> 00:07:54,500
Getting the entertainment sports
journal. Um, great to have the publicity.

135
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,100
Fantastic to show a few
people and have it on my CV.

136
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:01,700
The truth was a domain set battle
against entertainment law review.

137
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,970
Maybe only about eight
people read it is the truth.

138
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:09,470
And you'll soon find out from a lot of
the talks or rather a little bit the talk

139
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:12,800
that I give them a little bit of
time is what I actually realized.

140
00:08:12,801 --> 00:08:16,400
As much as it was really good for the
ego because no one was reading it,

141
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,820
I actually needed it to improve,
increase my profile to a degree.

142
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,230
And the way that I actually did
that, I've met my wife Holly, uh,

143
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,020
in 2007 and quite click quickly. Um, uh,

144
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,350
we talked about all the stuff that I
could do in my job and wants to do my job.

145
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,750
She actually then said to
me, well, hold on a second,

146
00:08:32,751 --> 00:08:37,220
why are you writing five or 6,000 words
for an entertainment law journal when

147
00:08:37,221 --> 00:08:40,430
you could be writing 500
words on your own blog, free.

148
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:44,630
The antibody could be able to then
access and read accordingly and actually

149
00:08:44,631 --> 00:08:47,480
thought, you know, it's
actually a pretty good idea. Um,

150
00:08:47,481 --> 00:08:50,900
and so what I ended up doing was,
um,

151
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,990
not necessarily not writing
in law journals overall,

152
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:58,620
but ultimately deciding to start my
own website, which has Daniel G. Dot.

153
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,420
Com and then,
um,

154
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,480
effectively start writing small pieces
about trying to demystify the football

155
00:09:05,731 --> 00:09:06,660
industry to a degree.

156
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:10,500
Even though actually at the time I
wasn't doing a huge amount of work in

157
00:09:10,501 --> 00:09:11,130
football,

158
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:14,130
I was doing small bets that
there is hopefully increasing
and the type of work I

159
00:09:14,131 --> 00:09:18,570
was doing, but I wasn't doing huge amounts
of that time. And it came, actually,

160
00:09:18,571 --> 00:09:21,450
it's a very fruitful is the wrong word,

161
00:09:21,451 --> 00:09:24,360
but a really interesting time
in the football industry.

162
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,960
There was financial fat play,
which I'll talk about in some detail.

163
00:09:27,961 --> 00:09:31,020
There was third party ownership,
which is a big thing at the time.

164
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,620
Luis Suarez came to the country.
Um,

165
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:39,360
and obviously he had a lot of um,
issues with racism, with biting,

166
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:44,100
with suspensions. John Terry
Marta came up as well. Um,

167
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:47,520
so I, Nicolas Anelka happened
at the same time. So what,

168
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:49,590
what was actually happening,
which is quite cool as well.

169
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,680
There were lots of cases and
lots of issues that the public,

170
00:09:54,691 --> 00:09:57,300
the wide fund funds really
wants to know about.

171
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:01,980
And what I had a little bit more time
before kids and marriage was to be able to

172
00:10:01,981 --> 00:10:06,660
read these cases, try and explain what
they meant for the average fund. Um,

173
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:11,550
and try and get beyond the Louis
Suarez is a racist or um, uh,

174
00:10:11,551 --> 00:10:16,530
it's a three much bond for fouling
somebody or actually if you look at the

175
00:10:16,531 --> 00:10:21,240
detail of a particular case, it means that
or it means this. And what I developed,

176
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:26,340
um, which was great was quite a strong
follower base on Twitter as well,

177
00:10:26,341 --> 00:10:31,260
which was a great amplifier of my blogs.
Um, to be able to then put forward,

178
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,410
easily accessible, easily
digestible five, six,

179
00:10:34,411 --> 00:10:37,140
700 word blogs that
people are interested in.

180
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,730
And then what happened is his role
to that was that journalists, um,

181
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,760
sky sports or the types of broadcast
media within interested in having me on

182
00:10:47,251 --> 00:10:49,870
their shows really, which
is, which is great. Um,

183
00:10:49,871 --> 00:10:54,871
and that in itself then drove the profile
that I was able to drive for myself

184
00:10:56,221 --> 00:10:58,640
and my firm was able then to um,

185
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:02,370
refine my message that I
wants to get across to people.

186
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:05,820
And in turn led me then to that,

187
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,740
which was from blog to book.

188
00:11:07,741 --> 00:11:11,910
So I used to give a lot of comments and
commentary to people in the football

189
00:11:11,911 --> 00:11:14,460
industry.
Someone I'm a journalist says,

190
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,730
why don't you think about writing a book
on the topic? And I said, oh, great idea.

191
00:11:17,731 --> 00:11:20,400
I don't think anyone will actually
think can be interested in it.

192
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:25,440
He introduced me to an agent's David
Luxton and who is bizarrely my agents,

193
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,430
which is quite strange to say, but
nice as well. Um, and he is an effect.

194
00:11:29,431 --> 00:11:33,990
The miracle worker that got my proposal
that I put to him out to five or six

195
00:11:33,991 --> 00:11:35,820
different publishers.
Um,

196
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:39,900
there's quite a long process in that
till or actually get the all clear to

197
00:11:39,901 --> 00:11:42,090
actually then get the deal
and to write the book.

198
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:47,420
And then more or less three years later
from starting to get the proposal to

199
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:52,080
finishing the book, we are there
with, um, with done deal. So, um,

200
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:56,920
that is the book that came out
a few weeks ago that, um, uh,

201
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,890
that so far has done really well.
You know,

202
00:11:59,891 --> 00:12:04,200
I don't know how many copies actually
mum has bought in order to actually skew

203
00:12:04,201 --> 00:12:08,440
the, uh, the Amazon algorithm
accordingly. But in any event, um, uh,

204
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:11,080
everyone's happy at the moment.
And then g household, which is,

205
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:15,490
which is nice to the extent that when I
told my daughters actually that I had a

206
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,130
book being published, my oldest one
is, he is six and my youngest one live,

207
00:12:19,131 --> 00:12:21,610
he is three and a half.
I told you I was writing a book.

208
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,810
I'm the teacher then at the next, uh, uh,
a teacher's meeting and came in and said,

209
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,630
oh, it was fantastic. That,
um, you know, you've written a,

210
00:12:28,631 --> 00:12:31,020
that you're involved in the book industry.
Um,

211
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:35,450
I didn't realize that you were a librarian
because Izzy had told her that I'd

212
00:12:35,451 --> 00:12:38,500
become a librarian because I'd
written, uh, written a book.

213
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:43,510
So that's my new new pastime as well as
being an author and a lawyer. So, um,

214
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,170
book out, um, uh,

215
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,380
and what I wants to share with
everybody for the next 15, 20 minutes,

216
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:55,980
hopefully if this works all right is
just a few insights into the world of

217
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:57,701
football,

218
00:12:57,701 --> 00:13:02,650
which I see on a daily basis and what
is covered and uncovered in the book,

219
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:06,280
but just talking about particular things.
So you'll see at the top transfer fees,

220
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,330
shirt, sales agents, book
deal, so boots, deals,

221
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,860
appearances and ImageRight
some of the more, um,

222
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:19,450
interesting elements that I
think and hope will be of value.

223
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:23,980
And please feel free to ask questions and
to delve into some of the things I say.

224
00:13:23,981 --> 00:13:26,500
I think we're going to keep the
questions if possible to the end,

225
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,590
but just hold your questions because
I'm always very keen on audience

226
00:13:29,591 --> 00:13:34,000
participation. So the most you're able to
ask, um, the batter I'm looking at, Tom,

227
00:13:34,001 --> 00:13:36,760
please be careful about the questions
because if you probably know as much as me

228
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:41,080
about some football stuff, so don't show
me up too much, please. Okay. Number one,

229
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,980
a 35 million pound transfer,
uh,

230
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,650
actually isn't a 35 million
pound transfer. Now,

231
00:13:47,651 --> 00:13:49,690
I know it sounds slightly
counter intuitive,

232
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,340
but I promise I'll try and explain myself.

233
00:13:51,341 --> 00:13:55,900
So when you look at the back page of a
story and the back page of a newspaper,

234
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:00,670
you'll see player moves for
35 million pounds. Uh, and um,

235
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:05,470
uh, and that's the, a fee basically that
the club has paid for that player. Yes,

236
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:06,400
that is the case.

237
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:10,750
But what I want to drill down to is
actually the liability that the players as

238
00:14:10,751 --> 00:14:14,530
well rather than the clubs the buying
club has to incur for that player. Now,

239
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:17,680
if a joke's talking about just
the transfer fee for a second,

240
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:23,130
the transfer fee is effectively the
amounts that's the buying club pays to the

241
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:26,200
sailing club.
The buying club has obvious,

242
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,190
but what isn't usually as obvious
is actually how that is structured.

243
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:33,700
So in most deals that I
see and I've come across,

244
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:38,940
what actually happens is there's what's
called a fixed and a contingent elements

245
00:14:39,881 --> 00:14:40,840
to a transfer fee.

246
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:46,150
The fixed bit being paid regardless of
anything over a particular period of time,

247
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,140
usually first,

248
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:51,800
second and third anniversaries of the
transfer and the contingent a certain

249
00:14:51,801 --> 00:14:56,480
bonuses or met certain conditions are met,
which mean bonuses are paid.

250
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:00,140
So if I give the 35 million pounds
example, it may be, for example,

251
00:15:00,141 --> 00:15:01,160
I'll try and do the math right.

252
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,120
That 50 million pounds is paid
upfront at the time of the transfer.

253
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:09,020
And then maybe on the first anniversary,
5 million pounds is paid.

254
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,150
Maybe on the second
anniversary of the transfer,

255
00:15:11,151 --> 00:15:14,690
another 5 million pounds is paid.
So that takes it to 25 million pounds.

256
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,690
It may be that for the next 10 million,
in order to be paid,

257
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:22,340
the buying club has to win. The Champions
League or the buying club has to uh,

258
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,110
win the Premiere League,
for example.

259
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,690
And if those performance
measures aren't hit,

260
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,330
then that's extra 10
million will never be paid.

261
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,930
It actually gets a little bit more
complicated than that because usually what

262
00:15:33,931 --> 00:15:37,740
has to happen is as well as the
club winning those trophies,

263
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,320
the player has to appear in a
certain amount of those games. I,

264
00:15:41,321 --> 00:15:45,030
he has to contribute to that
season's worth of success.

265
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,070
Now that's the first element.

266
00:15:48,071 --> 00:15:51,240
So 35 million pounds doesn't
usually mean 35 million pounds.

267
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:55,950
It actually can only my Tony mean 25
million pounds on certain contingencies as

268
00:15:55,951 --> 00:16:00,060
a result. The other element, which
is not factored into any of that,

269
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,320
is the play's wages.

270
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,950
Now obviously the players wages
are usually the biggest, um,

271
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:10,900
liability over the length of the deal.
If a player signs a five year deal, uh,

272
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:15,900
let's say for 200, 200,000 pounds a
week, that could od over five years.

273
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,160
I to try and do the calculations,

274
00:16:17,161 --> 00:16:22,161
possibly 50 million pounds worth of
liability over and above the transfer fee.

275
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:25,680
That might only be 25 million.
So the point is,

276
00:16:25,681 --> 00:16:30,681
when you see the headline at the back
page of the newspaper saying 35 million

277
00:16:30,721 --> 00:16:34,560
pound transfer, think actually the first
thing is you might not actually make,

278
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,570
it might not be a 35
million pound transfer,

279
00:16:36,571 --> 00:16:39,690
but actually the main liability
is actually the play's wages.

280
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:45,020
So 35 million pound transfer may actually
be if everything is included over a

281
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,120
hundred million pounds worth of
liability that's taken into account.

282
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,720
And the other thing that needs to be
taken into account is the agent's fee.

283
00:16:51,721 --> 00:16:54,270
But we'll talk about that
in just a second as well.

284
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,030
So myth number one,

285
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,240
35 million pound transfer isn't
usually a 35 million pound transfer.

286
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,070
It's a lot less,
but also a lot more.

287
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,110
Number two,
I see this quite a lot as well.

288
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,720
I feel I'm spending more time on this
side of the room then this side of the

289
00:17:10,721 --> 00:17:14,620
room, sorry, I'll try
this. Um, is this follows

290
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:21,310
without fail, pog Ba Latin, um,

291
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:25,250
Mannette, Liverpool, Salah,
whoever else it may be.

292
00:17:25,251 --> 00:17:27,770
Every time a big transfer happens,

293
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,970
the first thing that you will always
see back in back in the day is, uh,

294
00:17:31,971 --> 00:17:34,760
the clubs will recruit most
of the transfer fee from the,

295
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:39,970
from the shirt sales that they will then
they will then make as a result of the,

296
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:43,610
um, uh, as a result of
the transfer. I can,

297
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:48,620
I can't say categorically that
this absolutely never ever happens,

298
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:53,460
but I absolutely doubt that it ever
happens for the following reason.

299
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,310
So try and give an example,

300
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,540
and this is only from public information
because Manchester United for example,

301
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:05,370
of floats in the u s so
they have to provide certain
information to investors on

302
00:18:05,371 --> 00:18:08,310
a quarterly basis. Anyway,
it's reported to that.

303
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:12,480
Edward would states in some
of those courses, the reports
and what is published,

304
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:17,780
the Manchester United makes 75 million
pounds a year from Adidas apparel deal.

305
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,850
It makes 75 million pounds a year.

306
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
That decreases if they don't get to
the Champions League over a particular

307
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:28,110
period of seasons. But on the whole
75 million a year, and that's a 10,

308
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,290
I think it's a 10 year deal. So, um,

309
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:34,620
almost coming up to a billion
pounds for a 10 year deal,

310
00:18:34,621 --> 00:18:38,040
750 million pounds over 10 years.
Now,

311
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,260
what usually happens in these very,

312
00:18:40,261 --> 00:18:45,261
very big shirts deals is effectively
those apparel companies are paying a very

313
00:18:47,191 --> 00:18:52,191
big advance for the right to be able to
then exploit the brand and to be able to

314
00:18:53,761 --> 00:18:57,030
sell those shirts.
Um,

315
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,070
this isn't the Q and a part,

316
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:03,670
but does anybody think that
Manchester United or help?

317
00:19:03,671 --> 00:19:04,800
So just very quickly,

318
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:08,910
how many shirts do you think Manchester
United sell on a yearly basis?

319
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:14,400
Just very quickly shout outs
and hundred thousand higher.

320
00:19:14,401 --> 00:19:18,990
I'm doing a Bruce Force,
I think 15 million shirts.

321
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,400
That's quite a difference.

322
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:28,650
But it is,
well that's another big question.

323
00:19:28,651 --> 00:19:29,990
Fake or real shirts is that you can put,

324
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:34,780
let's just say authentic shirts
retailing for over 50 pounds. Uh,

325
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:37,050
shirts, 5 million. Okay.

326
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:40,470
So the last figures where I'm
from a season and a half ago,

327
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:45,471
that Manchester United on a yearly basis
sold 2.9 million shirts or rather rd

328
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,860
does showed or whoever the
manufacturer was 2.9 million shirts.

329
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:52,740
I'm not sure if that's more than a lot
of people think or less than other people

330
00:19:52,741 --> 00:19:56,700
think. I get varying degrees
of, I'm surprised either way.

331
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:02,090
The point being that usually what will
happen and those type of agreements is

332
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:05,430
there will be this advanced,
this is paid every year,

333
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:10,490
but after that there may not be anything
more paid as a result to the club by

334
00:20:12,781 --> 00:20:14,310
way of amounts.

335
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,970
Usually there will be
performance related amounts,

336
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,330
but that only kicks in after
a certain amount of shirts.

337
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:25,680
Sales are made on a yearly basis,
so it may well be,

338
00:20:25,681 --> 00:20:27,090
and I don't know that I did.

339
00:20:27,091 --> 00:20:32,091
US Don't pay anything more to Manchester
United per year over the 75 million

340
00:20:32,581 --> 00:20:37,290
pounds mark that they do. I want to say
pay what I mean his share in the revenue,

341
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:42,860
but let's say for example that Manchester
United and it does share some revenue

342
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:47,040
after they hit 2 million shirts,
sales a

343
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:52,270
and usually that share that royalty,
whatever you want to call it,

344
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:56,620
is actually probably only 10 or 20%
of the overall additional amount.

345
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,320
So let's just, without wanting to
confuse anyone in too much details,

346
00:21:00,321 --> 00:21:04,750
say that actually Manchester United for
every shirt sold over 2 million shirts,

347
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,880
maybe get 10 pounds per shirt.

348
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,810
So you don't need to meet to do the math
very quickly for you to work out that

349
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:15,640
one of the biggest clubs in the world
are not making huge amounts of money from

350
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:19,390
shirt sales over and above the amounts
that they're getting from their apparel

351
00:21:19,391 --> 00:21:21,160
manufacturer straight away.

352
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:26,950
Now the other question to also add
into the mix as well on that is, um,

353
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,480
and it's something that no one's really
done too much empirical evidence then is

354
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,300
would an additional or marginal,
um,

355
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,120
by a marginal fund,

356
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:40,870
by an additional shirt with
the new player's name on,

357
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:44,500
or were they already going to buy that
shirt with an existing players name on

358
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,260
which also fits into the narrative,

359
00:21:47,261 --> 00:21:51,880
which is it doesn't mean
that an absolutely new fun
is going to be buying an

360
00:21:51,881 --> 00:21:55,900
absolutely new players shirt.
It may be that they'll buy that shirt,

361
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,690
but we're going to buy it
anyway regardless of which
the player was going to be.

362
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:03,100
So second meth hopefully dispelled
in a little bit of detail,

363
00:22:03,101 --> 00:22:07,480
which is very rarely, whenever you
read a headline of shirt sales,

364
00:22:07,481 --> 00:22:10,720
we'll make fortunes for the club.
Usually they won't.

365
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,153
Okay.

366
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,580
Sorry.
It's a little bit smaller,

367
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:20,820
but you can have to strain to be
able to read it. Um, I know the,

368
00:22:20,821 --> 00:22:25,300
the question of agents is always
quite a topical issue generally.

369
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:30,280
Um, the narrative of
agents is that they, um,

370
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:30,970
uh,

371
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:35,080
don't do a great job for players or clubs
that they take too much money out of

372
00:22:35,081 --> 00:22:40,081
the game in terms of commissions and
that their approach is wheeler dealer at

373
00:22:40,121 --> 00:22:45,070
best. I have a slightly vested interest
in as I work with a lot of agents,

374
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:47,350
but the book hopefully
you'll see as well if you,

375
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:51,280
if you able to read it gives a slightly
different narrative to the usual

376
00:22:51,281 --> 00:22:51,731
narrative,

377
00:22:51,731 --> 00:22:56,500
which is agents are just bad guys doing
bad things all the time and nobody likes

378
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:58,110
them or at all the,

379
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:01,420
the difference with a lot of the very
good agencies that are extremely well

380
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:03,270
networked, um, uh,

381
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:08,200
very diligent in what they do
work incredibly hard in a very,

382
00:23:08,201 --> 00:23:11,440
very insecure industry.
And when I mean insecure industry,

383
00:23:11,441 --> 00:23:15,250
I mean devote worked very hard to get
very good players on their books and

384
00:23:15,251 --> 00:23:19,100
probably at every other window and other
agents has trying to poach their player

385
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,430
to say, I can get you a better
deal or I can get that for you.

386
00:23:21,431 --> 00:23:22,510
I can do this for you better.

387
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:26,270
I'm not saying all of a sudden poor
agent's doing a terrible job on the bread

388
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:26,950
line,

389
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:31,950
but the vast majority of agents are not
earning the huge sums that are reported

390
00:23:31,961 --> 00:23:36,760
in the media. Um, the points of
what I'm trying to get to here is,

391
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,550
is that there is an interesting
narrative which works in the media,

392
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:41,650
which is look how much,
uh,

393
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:46,280
agents take out of the game and
look how much clubs pay agents.

394
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:50,320
And this is the thing that I think a lot
of people maybe don't quite grasp in,

395
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:54,580
in, in the same amount of detail that
I've been able to be able to work with an

396
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:59,120
industry for some time,
is players don't pay their agents.

397
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:02,720
So I just want that to sink in for a
second because before I started in the

398
00:24:02,721 --> 00:24:05,990
industry, it seems quite a strange
concept to me is like if I'm,

399
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:11,050
if I'm a player and how is my agent and
I and how does a move for me to a new

400
00:24:12,081 --> 00:24:16,640
club, I thought that I would pay
him because my contract is with him.

401
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:21,620
I'll pay you a percentage of my earnings
and that's the way that things work

402
00:24:21,621 --> 00:24:22,454
generally.

403
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:27,080
But the way that things tend to work at
least in the UK and other countries is

404
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:31,250
in order to incentivize the
player to move to their club,

405
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:35,420
the club pays the players agents.

406
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,900
Does that make sense?
Okay.

407
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,990
And that has caused controversy
because on the whole,

408
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:50,110
that means that funds see
their club paying agents and
they see the amounts that

409
00:24:52,821 --> 00:24:57,821
they pay agents and don't like the amounts
that they pay agents and where it can

410
00:24:58,701 --> 00:25:00,620
get a little bit tricky for the player.

411
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:04,460
And I don't want to go into too much tax
detail cause it's certainly not the tax

412
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:07,250
talk and I don't want to get involved
in that type of stuff as well.

413
00:25:07,251 --> 00:25:11,300
But the one thing that
actually then becomes quite
intro already heard someone's

414
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:14,240
heard too much about taxes as well.
Um,

415
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,870
the one thing that's important just
to stress about that is, is that, um,

416
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:22,760
that is seen as what's called
a taxable benefit. The,

417
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:27,770
the club paying the player's agent is
what's called a PLF and d benefits.

418
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:32,120
It's like what Mel and medical
insurance or a company car would be.

419
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,110
So even though the player
isn't paying his agent,

420
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,840
he has to pay tax on
the club Pangas agent.

421
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:43,790
And if that is one of the most important
things that I actually see when a

422
00:25:43,791 --> 00:25:47,360
transfer happens is that there's
been so many times when the player,

423
00:25:47,361 --> 00:25:51,500
18 months on from a transfer,
we'll get a big tax bill from HMRC.

424
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:55,610
And then the, the players say, well hold
on a second. Why have I got a tax bill?

425
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:00,020
The club has paid, uh, uh,
my, my agent on my behalf.

426
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:03,590
And then if the agent hasn't done a great
job, unfortunately the agent says, ah,

427
00:26:03,591 --> 00:26:05,630
yeah, but there was still a
tax bill to be paid on that.

428
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,720
And what usually happens for very savvy
agents when a transfer is happening,

429
00:26:11,721 --> 00:26:14,480
we see this more and more, and I'm
sure you guys will have heard of this,

430
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:19,490
similar to equivalent in the employment
contracts and agent will negotiate

431
00:26:19,491 --> 00:26:24,491
what's called a gross up close and a
gross up clause is morale and a miraculous

432
00:26:24,861 --> 00:26:29,861
payment which comes one week before
HMRC is tax bell comes along,

433
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:35,320
which means that then the player doesn't
feel the money going out of his account

434
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,780
because it's more or less
going straight to HMRC,

435
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,740
which actually is a very clever
thing for the agent to do,

436
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:47,040
rarely because otherwise they will.
And I've seen it time and time again,

437
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:50,820
get into an awful lot of trouble with
the player when the player has to

438
00:26:50,821 --> 00:26:55,821
basically pay half of the agent's fee in
tax to the tax authorities at the right

439
00:26:56,041 --> 00:27:00,150
time. So they're the type of
things that you see day to day,

440
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:04,290
but the point genuinely being is
whenever it feels counterintuitive,

441
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:08,160
almost always the player
will never pay his agent.

442
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,640
And we'll talk about what the thing
is in the future that's going on.

443
00:27:11,641 --> 00:27:12,420
I think that's,

444
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:16,050
that may there's a possibility that
that may change with a new fee for

445
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,580
regulations that are being implemented

446
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,673
next.

447
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:24,200
Brute deals are complicated. Um, okay.

448
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,330
So just very briefly and I'm
always interested in doing, um,

449
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:31,910
actually I do use the good at
Google analytics tool for, um, uh,

450
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:35,120
my website to be able to understand
actually, which are my favorite,

451
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,900
which are people's favorite blog posts
more or less than what I've the most

452
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,410
abused from the,

453
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:45,030
the blog that I did on boots
deals is by far and away the,

454
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,120
the blog that I've had
my most of you is on,

455
00:27:47,121 --> 00:27:49,520
in my entire history of writing any blogs.

456
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:53,570
And the reason why I think hopefully
it's hit an interesting, um, um, uh,

457
00:27:53,571 --> 00:27:55,070
an interesting,
uh,

458
00:27:55,130 --> 00:28:00,130
point is most people think that a boots
deal I when a player signs a deal and it

459
00:28:01,241 --> 00:28:04,250
may be for goalkeepers with their golden
gloves as well for their Shin pads and

460
00:28:04,251 --> 00:28:08,900
their boots that all they are paying for
is the ability of the player when they

461
00:28:08,901 --> 00:28:13,901
go on the pitch to use their boots and
Shin pads and maybe have a couple of

462
00:28:14,121 --> 00:28:16,670
appearances on some promotional stuff.

463
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,880
So you've seen Massey last week Pepsi
but he used his idea dust boots as I did

464
00:28:22,031 --> 00:28:25,490
as shoes for the promotional
videos, et cetera. Um,

465
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:31,250
so it means more or less means this,
whenever I see a boots deal,

466
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:34,460
if it's with Puma, Adidas, Nike,

467
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:39,730
new balance underarm or whoever else
it may be in almost every situation.

468
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,980
It doesn't cover just boots.

469
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,980
So just a quick Straw poll.

470
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:49,370
Who thinks of boots deal
should cover headphones?

471
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,570
Anybody?
Yeah,

472
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,890
to thank you.
You've got a head start there.

473
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:04,160
The,
the scope of a boots deal is vast

474
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:08,960
and there's two particular caveats
and carve outs that I see quite a lot.

475
00:29:08,961 --> 00:29:11,030
One is with most manufacturers,

476
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:16,330
they will try and carve out as much as
possible into their scope that they can

477
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:21,250
then exploit for the player
to be able to use. So um,

478
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:26,210
headphones is a big one. Um, shampoo
and shit. Skincare is another big one.

479
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:31,400
Any types of electrical
goods is another one. Um,

480
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:34,760
does anyone think Armani
is a competitor of humor

481
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:41,820
apparently in some boot deals or is it
not getting Puma's but the general point

482
00:29:42,911 --> 00:29:44,380
is,
is that if possible,

483
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:49,710
what a brand is looking to try and do is
to create the biggest scope as possible

484
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,340
for a player.

485
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,590
Not to be able to endorse anything
else is the truth because it gives them

486
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:01,890
ultimately a bigger window to be able
to put a dress the player up in all of

487
00:30:03,041 --> 00:30:04,870
their gear all the time.

488
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:10,930
And also the point worth mentioning as
well is just if you've signed a Nike deal,

489
00:30:10,931 --> 00:30:11,560
for example,

490
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:16,540
obviously it goes without saying that
you shouldn't be going out wearing Adidas

491
00:30:16,541 --> 00:30:17,380
trainers.

492
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:22,600
But ultimately the practical reality is
is that if you are signing a long term

493
00:30:22,601 --> 00:30:25,940
Knightdale, you're probably not going
to be able to where I need to add,

494
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:30,850
I did ask for the next five years
at all. And if you do, bear in mind,

495
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,540
if you do wear any competitor,
and especially at direct competitor,

496
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:38,290
it's pretty likely you're deal is over,

497
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:42,140
almost very likely your deal is over.

498
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,340
So that's the one thing on the
brand alignment and scope of points.

499
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:50,450
The other bit that's quite interesting I
think also on boot deals is the amounts.

500
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:54,560
So you may have, the agent may
say to the player, okay fantastic,

501
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:59,180
you're going to earn 500,000
euros a year, um, for your deal.

502
00:30:59,181 --> 00:31:01,280
And the player says, great,
great news, great to hear.

503
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,590
There's one onyx at the back
of most boots deal contracts,

504
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:09,110
which always scares me whenever I see it.

505
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:14,720
And the reason why scared it scares me
to a degree is it because it is a direct

506
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:19,010
table which relates to the amount of
appearances that the player has to make on

507
00:31:19,011 --> 00:31:21,110
a yearly or seasonal basis.

508
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:26,030
So what usually happens is the table,
if he's an international player,

509
00:31:26,031 --> 00:31:29,600
which the big players are obviously
who are getting the bigger money,

510
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:34,960
it will say you have to perform all appear
in 80% of your club team matches and

511
00:31:37,671 --> 00:31:41,810
you have to appear in 70%
of your international club
matches and if you don't

512
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:46,400
the retainer,
which is the overall amount reduces by 40%

513
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:52,410
and sometimes bigger depending on depends
on how you want to negotiate that.

514
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:56,160
So one of the important
elements is for two things,

515
00:31:56,161 --> 00:31:58,770
one to try and negotiate
hard hard on those points,

516
00:31:58,771 --> 00:32:02,430
but secondly to make sure the
players aware of that point.

517
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,680
Now there's another question
all of that which is,

518
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,690
and I'll talk about it in
the next slide to a second,

519
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:10,410
but I want to just briefly mention it
here and this is obviously where lawyers

520
00:32:10,411 --> 00:32:14,550
get involved a lot more. What do you
think the definition of an appearance is?

521
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:23,310
Exactly. I'm not. All of
that is exactly right.

522
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:26,280
Is it appearing in the match day squad?

523
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:31,530
Is it being on the pitch?
Is it starting on the pitch?

524
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:35,760
Is that ending on the pitch? Is it five
minutes? Is it 10 minutes? Is it 20,

525
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:37,230
you know,

526
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:40,190
that is one of the most important went
what I think it might be the next slide

527
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:44,690
which has gone through quite
nicely, perfect, seamless.

528
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:50,180
Um, that is one of the
most important, um, uh,

529
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:55,300
definitions in a contract that I will
tend to deal with because ultimately for a

530
00:32:56,841 --> 00:33:01,220
boot deal, if an appearance can
simply be 10 minutes in a game,

531
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:05,480
you can obviously imagine that it's very
much easier to be able to get to that

532
00:33:05,481 --> 00:33:07,070
70, 80, 90,

533
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:11,600
whatever percent threshold in order to
maintain your retainer amount in your

534
00:33:11,601 --> 00:33:12,434
boot deal.

535
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:17,060
But most importantly in an
employment contract setting,

536
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,370
this is very,
very,

537
00:33:19,371 --> 00:33:23,840
very strategically important for an agent
and a player to know about as you can

538
00:33:23,841 --> 00:33:25,880
imagine.
But usually for two reasons.

539
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:30,440
The first is when, um, uh, uh,

540
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:34,100
an agent is negotiating his
player's employment contracts.

541
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,530
There is much more, um, uh, uh,

542
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:42,580
there is much more consideration given
to variable pay rather than fixed pay as

543
00:33:44,421 --> 00:33:45,350
the husband in previous years.

544
00:33:45,351 --> 00:33:49,400
And what I mean is fixed is you will
get 50,000 pounds regardless if you play

545
00:33:49,401 --> 00:33:51,980
one minute,
whether you're not even in the squad.

546
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:55,340
And it doesn't matter whether you
play or not, that's the fixed amount.

547
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:59,630
The player always knows that he will
get that amount regardless of what he,

548
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:01,310
how he plays or what he does.

549
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:05,900
What a lot of the elite clubs are
doing now is trying to reduce the fixed

550
00:34:05,901 --> 00:34:08,600
amounts and increase the variable amounts,

551
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:12,170
which is if you play and if you win,

552
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:17,660
you'll get more than uh, if
you would have just, uh, um,

553
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:22,250
how'd your 50 grand amount every month,
every week, and a little bit extra.

554
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:27,740
So the incentive effectively is that if
you think you're good enough to play an

555
00:34:27,741 --> 00:34:28,574
office team,

556
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,820
you should take a lower fixed amount and
a higher variable amount because we're

557
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,351
good enough,

558
00:34:33,351 --> 00:34:36,710
which means you're going to appear and
you're going to win and therefore you'll

559
00:34:36,711 --> 00:34:38,690
be remunerated better than
you otherwise would have done.

560
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,110
But you can see obviously the point
that I'm trying to get her here,

561
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:46,880
which then becomes the points
appearance becomes very, very important.

562
00:34:46,881 --> 00:34:51,881
As a definition because the bonus
element for the employment contracts is

563
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:53,810
appearance fee.

564
00:34:53,811 --> 00:34:58,790
We'll give you a bonus now as you can
imagine then it's exactly all the points

565
00:34:58,791 --> 00:35:02,450
that you said doesn't appearance mean and
it usually does and lots of instances,

566
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:05,780
uh,
starting a premiere league much,

567
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,930
that's what it can sometimes be
and that can be caveats throughout.

568
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:12,800
There was a different bonus for starting
a premier league much to an Essay Cup,

569
00:35:12,801 --> 00:35:17,240
much to a Champions League, much to a
League Cup, much to a friendly much.

570
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:21,200
That's how varied it can be and it can
be different when amounts for all of

571
00:35:21,201 --> 00:35:24,080
those competitions and sometimes there
can be merged together so it's an

572
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:27,170
appearance and when bonus
in order to get the bonus.

573
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:33,670
So obviously as you can get to now an
appearance and how that is defined is

574
00:35:34,521 --> 00:35:38,460
crucial as to whether a player
may get the bonus or not.

575
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,051
For an agent,

576
00:35:40,051 --> 00:35:43,320
he'll want to try and make sure that
one minute on that pitch classifies as a

577
00:35:43,321 --> 00:35:44,700
bonus,
as an appearance.

578
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:49,470
Whereas the club will want to make sure
that it's a start in the first team

579
00:35:49,471 --> 00:35:51,210
squad for particular game,

580
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:54,700
which means it's harder obviously for
the player to do that if he's injured out

581
00:35:54,701 --> 00:35:56,040
to for whatever else it may be.

582
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:01,020
The other element of why
when it appearance becomes
very important is because

583
00:36:01,021 --> 00:36:05,140
sometimes in a contract there'll be a
ratchet effect. And what that will be is,

584
00:36:05,141 --> 00:36:08,940
is after you've played in 20 games,
40 games, 60 games, 80 games,

585
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,330
your salary will go up
accordingly as well.

586
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:15,690
So you may be 50,000 pounds
that you get is fixed.

587
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:19,050
If you play 20 games for
us and appear in 20 games,

588
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:23,850
you will then go up to 60,000 pounds a
week and then 870,000 pounds a week if

589
00:36:23,851 --> 00:36:25,920
you get to 40 60 80.
And again,

590
00:36:25,921 --> 00:36:28,770
that's very important for
how you define appearance.

591
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,510
I've talked about parents
who are way too long,

592
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:33,810
but hopefully you can see
why that actually becomes
quite an important element

593
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:38,940
for players and agents
and clubs to understand

594
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:45,120
last bits about dispelling mess a little
bit as well. Um, so I've just been,

595
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,540
just put the phrase out there which is
image rights deals are just another way

596
00:36:48,541 --> 00:36:49,620
to avoid tax.

597
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:55,220
I just want to briefly
spend we okay for time, um,

598
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:58,980
a few minutes talking about what's an
image rights deal is for players and then

599
00:36:58,981 --> 00:37:03,900
talking about why it's important in the
current, in the current environment.

600
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:09,420
So if I just try and uh,
uh, explained very briefly,

601
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:14,370
traditionally a player will only
have one contract with his club.

602
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:19,140
It will be an employment contract that
will say you are employed by this club to

603
00:37:19,141 --> 00:37:22,620
play football straight forward with
all of those clauses and all the things

604
00:37:22,621 --> 00:37:23,640
we've talked about previously.

605
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:29,820
Nowadays for a lot of the elite
clubs with their elite players,

606
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:34,140
they have a huge raft of partners and
partnership agreements and endorsement

607
00:37:34,141 --> 00:37:37,950
deals that they can activate across
the globe at which are very lucrative

608
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:39,083
contracts.

609
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:43,500
And what clubs are realizing
is they are happy to,

610
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:47,760
well not realizing what they want to
do is control the activities of their

611
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:52,880
players to a degree so that they can
activate those players for the club to be

612
00:37:54,721 --> 00:37:59,721
able to then activate its own partnership
arrangements over a longterm basis.

613
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:03,860
So do spurs won a
hurricane to be able to um,

614
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:06,990
activate a night campaign
for Spurs? Yes, they do.

615
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:12,560
To a Liverpool wants most solar to be
able to activate a particular campaign for

616
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:18,120
Standard Chartered. Obviously they
do within the standard contract,

617
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:23,130
there are default positions where players
have to have x amount of appearances.

618
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:27,510
But what is happening more and more with
elite clubs is they are entering now

619
00:38:27,511 --> 00:38:32,160
into two separate deals with their
players. One is the employment contract,

620
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:37,210
but the second is an image rights
contract usually with a player's company.

621
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,140
Yeah.

622
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:42,920
And what happens in this
deal is the players company
more or less promises to do

623
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:47,870
two things, which is a real
significant value to the club. One is,

624
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,930
it says for the provision
of x amount of money.

625
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:53,190
Okay.

626
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:56,580
Uh,
we the club want to make sure that you,

627
00:38:56,581 --> 00:38:58,350
the players image rights company,

628
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:03,560
make sure that the player appears in x
amount of endorsement opportunities and

629
00:39:04,981 --> 00:39:08,310
partnership opportunities
for the clubs partners.

630
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:10,363
Does that make sense?

631
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:11,480
Okay.

632
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,171
Guaranteed number.

633
00:39:12,171 --> 00:39:17,090
So that means that then
the club's commercial teams
can go out and sell quite a

634
00:39:17,091 --> 00:39:22,070
lot of inventory on the basis of knowing
that maybe that top 15 stars will be

635
00:39:22,071 --> 00:39:27,071
available and are contractually available
to help endorse the club in a club

636
00:39:27,471 --> 00:39:28,304
context.

637
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:29,560
Yeah.

638
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,500
Not so very important to element.
The other element,

639
00:39:32,501 --> 00:39:37,501
which is a very useful to the club in
paying a players image rights company

640
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:44,270
is that there are a hell of a lot of
restrictions that then the club can impose

641
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,300
on the player.
So just to give you a brief example,

642
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:52,860
so I don't know how many
partners Manchester United
hough throughout the world.

643
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:56,550
Global partners. There's a lot, I mean I,

644
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,330
I'm not sure it's quite 150 I lost count.
I think there was upwards of 90.

645
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:06,690
So, for example, and just by way of if
it's Manchester United, if it's Chelsea,

646
00:40:06,691 --> 00:40:08,120
if it's Liverpool,
if it's arsenal,

647
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:13,280
a lot of these clubs have a big roster
of commercial partners and what those

648
00:40:15,001 --> 00:40:19,800
clubs would ideally want from that
players is to ensure that those players

649
00:40:19,801 --> 00:40:24,801
cannot contract with a
competitor of the club brands,

650
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,960
which means that they are effectively
clean from any club competitors,

651
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:37,030
which then puts them in a strong
position to make sure that their players,

652
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:42,240
I'll never going to endorse competitors
of the club's brands and that's quite a

653
00:40:43,091 --> 00:40:46,450
valuable commodity to be able
to actually um, use as well.

654
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:49,060
The flip side,

655
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:53,410
which is why we talked about tax is the
reason I've said all of that commercial

656
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:58,460
and explanation is because still there
are always big headlines about the fact

657
00:40:58,571 --> 00:40:59,800
that um,

658
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:04,420
image rights deals are just a way to
avoid tax because obviously players,

659
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:08,980
image rights companies
are paying corporation tax
rather than pay as you go pay

660
00:41:08,981 --> 00:41:11,560
as you earn.
And national insurance contributions.

661
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:16,500
The point being is that even though that
money is coming in and the club under

662
00:41:16,501 --> 00:41:21,010
players, image rights company
is only paying corporation tax,

663
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,360
that money is still in that
club's accounts. It has to. If,

664
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:26,530
if the player wants to remove that money,

665
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:28,390
he's either got to pay
it through dividends,

666
00:41:28,391 --> 00:41:31,840
he's got to pay it through salary
to other people through the company.

667
00:41:31,841 --> 00:41:36,841
Hover is there still needs to be Tux
paid for onshore companies that are using

668
00:41:38,181 --> 00:41:41,990
an image right structure.
So my point is I'm not the uh,

669
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:45,320
the guide that will always say image
rights structures are always totally

670
00:41:45,321 --> 00:41:47,900
inadequate.
It's just another way to avoid tax.

671
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:53,200
Usually there are very good reasons
why clubs will want to enter into image

672
00:41:53,421 --> 00:41:55,010
rights agreements with that players.

673
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:58,850
One because it guarantees
them appearances and two,

674
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:04,030
it means that they can just restrict
the players in promoting competitor club

675
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:09,260
brands, which can be very
important. Okay. Almost there.

676
00:42:09,261 --> 00:42:14,180
I promise. What's next?
I just wanted to talk,

677
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:18,230
we've talked actually about agents
already and get your questions ready.

678
00:42:18,231 --> 00:42:21,410
If you have any, any questions as we
go, more than happy to answer anything.

679
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:26,360
But lots of people, um, actually since
I've released the book of acts, you said,

680
00:42:26,361 --> 00:42:29,690
well, what do you think is
next for the industry? And, uh,

681
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:32,140
there's a chapter right at the
beginning of the book called, um,

682
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:35,620
the football ecosystem where talk about
how everything is sort of overlaid

683
00:42:35,621 --> 00:42:39,530
together. So, um, you know, where
the player's fit in with their clubs,

684
00:42:39,531 --> 00:42:40,970
where the club's fit in with the league,

685
00:42:40,971 --> 00:42:42,860
where the leaks fits in with broadcasters,

686
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,320
where broadcast is fits in with
the funds for subscriptions.

687
00:42:45,321 --> 00:42:48,980
Where of our international games was
about fee for new way for and all of these

688
00:42:48,981 --> 00:42:53,480
different ways that um, um, the
football world works. And people said,

689
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:56,810
said to me for quite some
time and continue to ask me,

690
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,570
is the football model sustainable?

691
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:02,030
I think that's one of the things
that lots of people say, you know,

692
00:43:02,031 --> 00:43:06,100
football players are being paid huge
amounts of sons to be able to played

693
00:43:06,101 --> 00:43:08,330
football and for their
image to be able to be used.

694
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:13,490
Is that model sustainable in the longer
term where we have sky for example,

695
00:43:13,491 --> 00:43:18,130
and bt paying five over 5 billion pounds,
um,

696
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:19,730
for UK rights.

697
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:25,120
And a whole raft of broadcasters paying
upwards of 4 million at 4 billion for

698
00:43:25,371 --> 00:43:28,010
the overseas rights for life
Premiere League matches.

699
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:32,720
The query is well how come clubs still
afford to pay all of these wages and pay

700
00:43:32,721 --> 00:43:34,400
these exorbitant transfer fees?

701
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,800
Is the bottom going to come out
to the market at some point?

702
00:43:36,801 --> 00:43:41,000
That's the type of question I get asked
quite a lot and the answer at least at

703
00:43:41,001 --> 00:43:43,610
the time being, and that's why I just
put the broadcasting point that there is,

704
00:43:43,611 --> 00:43:48,611
is that so long as there is an appetite
for broadcasters to spend large sums of

705
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:55,220
money because they think they can recoup
that money by way of subscriptions in

706
00:43:55,221 --> 00:43:58,970
different models then at the
moment the answer is yes.

707
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:03,770
But we see, I saw some interesting starts
a few weeks ago explaining that sky.

708
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:07,100
Um, uh, in the purchasing of the, the,

709
00:44:07,101 --> 00:44:10,880
the rights for Premiere League matches
seem to be straining a little bit in

710
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:14,810
removing some of their other contents
because they've had to spend so much money

711
00:44:14,811 --> 00:44:17,840
on Premiere League matches and
live Premiere League matches.

712
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:19,820
And in the same way,

713
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:24,560
whilst the sky has always
been the incumbent for live
Premiere League matches,

714
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:29,890
Beatty came into the markets to auctions
ago effectively because they saw quite

715
00:44:30,201 --> 00:44:31,290
significant churn.

716
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:36,890
They saw churn away from their broadband
offering into sky broadband because

717
00:44:39,421 --> 00:44:43,320
people were already taking a pay TV,

718
00:44:43,321 --> 00:44:48,090
Sky Sports and thought that they should
bundle sky broadband with their sky

719
00:44:48,091 --> 00:44:48,924
sports offering.

720
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,790
So in some ways was a lot of commentators
said at the time was that bt came into

721
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:58,380
the markets to protect their broadband
offering and then in order to be able to

722
00:44:58,381 --> 00:45:01,350
then get champions league rights and
Premier League rights and then you can see

723
00:45:01,351 --> 00:45:03,480
what's happened subsequently,
um,

724
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:07,340
bt by e a sky have their own, um, uh,

725
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:11,010
mobile offering as well. And you have
what's called a quad play offering.

726
00:45:11,011 --> 00:45:16,011
So you have to quad play players playing
out in the UK market for a whole range

727
00:45:16,531 --> 00:45:21,450
of consumer goods. Um, pay TV and sky PTV,

728
00:45:21,451 --> 00:45:25,470
sorry. And the premier league being a
very big part of that overall picture.

729
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:27,840
So the question is,
at some point,

730
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:32,730
who knows what will happen is where the
subscription start dropping off because

731
00:45:32,731 --> 00:45:34,290
of the cord cutting generation.

732
00:45:34,291 --> 00:45:37,620
Because people aren't willing
to pay 60 70 pounds a month,

733
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:41,520
the sky or bt pay TV subscriptions.

734
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:46,650
The question asked a week ago,
Simon Jordan was on um, um, uh,

735
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:49,710
talk sport and he said, why don't
the Premiere League just go it alone?

736
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:54,450
Why don't they just go straight to market
and offer an Ott offering globally?

737
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:56,800
And I ask people to pay eight,

738
00:45:56,970 --> 00:46:00,780
eight to 10 pounds a month to watch every
premier league much they want and take

739
00:46:00,781 --> 00:46:02,700
away the broadcasters. I've, I,

740
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:07,650
I wrote a blog about 10 years about that
10 years ago about that exact point.

741
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:08,520
You know,

742
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:13,020
quite a lot of major league baseball do
it really well in the states and there's

743
00:46:13,021 --> 00:46:16,560
a real interesting offering now that
could possibly come to fruition.

744
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,860
But the truth is it
would take a very brave,

745
00:46:19,861 --> 00:46:24,580
whoever the next chief executive of the
Premiere League to come in and decide

746
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:29,400
not to take the 9 billion pounds check
that is usually on the table for the

747
00:46:29,401 --> 00:46:33,840
global distribution of its rights.
So if I just end on that note,

748
00:46:33,841 --> 00:46:35,910
which is are things changing his death?

749
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,830
There's cool things happening
in the market right now.

750
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,140
There's lots of different
broadcasters doing cool things,

751
00:46:40,141 --> 00:46:45,141
but ultimately so long as that money
funnel continues because funds and

752
00:46:46,111 --> 00:46:49,260
subscribers are subscribing
to those channels,

753
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:52,810
then that money flow will
continue throughout the game
and players will probably

754
00:46:52,811 --> 00:46:57,811
be paid significant amounts because they
are that good and because the clubs can

755
00:46:58,021 --> 00:47:00,060
afford it.
So on that note,

756
00:47:00,061 --> 00:47:04,350
I think I'll probably say thank you
for listening and happy to answer any

757
00:47:04,351 --> 00:47:05,184
questions.

758
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:10,260
[inaudible]

759
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:15,770
what's the strangest thing that you've
seen in a player's employment contracts

760
00:47:15,771 --> 00:47:19,860
with the club? Like a
clause or some sort of, um,

761
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:26,960
I haven't seen any would like totally
bizarre things that I'm thinking.

762
00:47:26,961 --> 00:47:29,000
Oh my gosh,
that's just really weird.

763
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:34,810
But there's lots of publicized ones that
I've put in the book. Rarely. So, um,

764
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,820
if I talk about a few of them,
um,

765
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:40,190
and this is just what's being
reported in the press really. Um,

766
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:42,230
so Neil Rodnick who was
an ex Liverpool play,

767
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,760
I'm supposed player back in
the day who um, uh, you know,

768
00:47:45,761 --> 00:47:49,690
I think could Devonia really played
center but because he was quite a big guy,

769
00:47:49,691 --> 00:47:50,980
but you know,
he scored a great goal.

770
00:47:50,981 --> 00:47:55,310
I remember in the [inaudible] nine
new game when he went, um, uh,

771
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:57,850
towards the end of his career
it's a particular club. Um,

772
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,070
the report was that they put a way,

773
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:05,130
a weight clause in his contract that if
he went over a certain weight he would

774
00:48:06,431 --> 00:48:09,970
be fined or his wages would
be reduced by certain limit.

775
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:14,470
Another clause which, um, I read
about, which was Stefan Schwartz,

776
00:48:14,471 --> 00:48:16,630
he was a Swedish international player.

777
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:19,940
He moved to Sunderland and apparently
there was a clause which said he,

778
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,930
Sunderland had read somewhere that one
of the things that always wanted to do

779
00:48:22,931 --> 00:48:23,890
was to go to space.

780
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,810
So Sunday and apparently puts a clause
in saying during your time as our club,

781
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:31,990
you are not allowed,
you're prohibited from going into space.

782
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:36,640
And there was another one
which is from a Liverpool plan,

783
00:48:36,641 --> 00:48:40,870
next level plus digging could be on to
be, he was a Norwegian International. Um,

784
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:45,010
he, uh, his father was I
think an Olympic skier and uh,

785
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:47,860
Liverpool ensured that there was a
clause in which he said he couldn't ski

786
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:49,460
during the time that
he was Liverpool Fund.

787
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,700
All of a player obviously
for obvious reasons really.

788
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:54,200
And there is that is quite standard
clause that you can't be anything.

789
00:48:54,201 --> 00:48:56,770
It hasn't just for the obvious reasons
that you probably hurt yourself.

790
00:48:58,070 --> 00:49:00,870
Just quick question about the yeah.
The boots stuff that you put up as well.

791
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:04,500
I've got a good friend actually works
for one of the big two and d. Um,

792
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:06,690
he was saying about the,

793
00:49:06,691 --> 00:49:09,630
one of the biggest challenges he sites
we're working with some of the players he

794
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:12,810
looks after five premier
league clubs I think, um, is,

795
00:49:12,811 --> 00:49:16,800
is their egos and not their personalities.
And they all want things for free,

796
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:18,900
even though they own,
you know, mega money.

797
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:22,770
So I suppose my question is around
expectations. Do you, do you,

798
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:27,420
how do you deal with expectations?
Were players and with, with big ego,

799
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:32,070
well not everybody has got big acres
and brushing everybody puts, um,

800
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,560
yeah. How, how'd you deal with kind
of what those expectations were,

801
00:49:34,561 --> 00:49:36,750
players and those, you know, big players.

802
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:40,190
Are you talking about, uh, W in terms
of boot gears or just generally?

803
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:43,100
Just generally? Yeah, I suppose
it's quite difficult to manage.

804
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,280
Um, simple truth is that, um,

805
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:51,330
of the players that I have close
relationships with and literally it's,

806
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:54,030
it's hilarious and cool as a football fan,

807
00:49:54,031 --> 00:49:56,640
they'll just what's up you and say
hello and literally I'm giving book

808
00:49:56,641 --> 00:50:01,641
recommendations to one player who's
interested in like just expanding is

809
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:03,500
expanding his,
um,

810
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:06,540
a repertoire of reading at the moment
because I've lived through a weight trips

811
00:50:06,541 --> 00:50:10,830
and has got lots of time
on his hands. Um, but the,

812
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:15,030
the majority of players that I end
up having good relationships with,

813
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:18,480
the guys that want to know
the detail is the truth.

814
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:22,710
And usually in my experience the players
that want to know the detail of the

815
00:50:22,711 --> 00:50:25,860
most switched on to understand
the way things work.

816
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:31,340
The players that may be don't are the
ones that I'd be like just leave it and

817
00:50:31,341 --> 00:50:33,790
let the lawyer do it, let the account
and do it. Let the agent do it.

818
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,840
However is that,
that's absolutely fine too,

819
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:40,430
but usually I don't like to call it pre
Madonnas days is actually because maybe

820
00:50:40,431 --> 00:50:44,780
they're not as educated as they need as
as the team around the need to give them

821
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:49,340
to make sure they understand what they
need to be doing on a daily basis to get

822
00:50:49,341 --> 00:50:52,790
by is the truth and what I try
and do and lots of the time,

823
00:50:52,791 --> 00:50:55,580
just to flip it onto the positive
is that every time a new player,

824
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,060
even if it's a young player especially
comes into the office to say hello or

825
00:50:59,061 --> 00:51:01,520
helping them with the deal.
My Dad was like, look,

826
00:51:01,521 --> 00:51:03,890
just give me half an hour with
the agents and the player.

827
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:06,770
I just want to talk you through
particular things I think are going to be

828
00:51:06,771 --> 00:51:10,700
important for the next deal. For the
next endorsement deal you're signing.

829
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:15,650
Think about what you're doing on Twitter
or in store or snap or Tinder. Um,

830
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:20,450
literally because you know,
everybody has a phone,

831
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:22,280
everybody has a video,

832
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:26,720
everybody wants to catch someone out
doing something they shouldn't do,

833
00:51:26,721 --> 00:51:29,230
who's famous. That's the
truth. Unfortunately,

834
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:32,180
that were living at the
moment players 20 years ago.

835
00:51:32,181 --> 00:51:34,890
We're in a much in a way and much more
privileged position that it can have gas.

836
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:37,250
We'll probably get to wear it a lot
more stuff that players can't do now.

837
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:38,630
So that's almost the point,

838
00:51:38,631 --> 00:51:42,620
which is I'm trying to just to
flip and pivots the narrative,

839
00:51:42,621 --> 00:51:46,520
which is get players better educated as
to what the needs to be doing so they

840
00:51:46,521 --> 00:51:49,700
can make more informed decisions.
Always players would do things wrong.

841
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:53,600
That was fallible as as us. Um, we just,

842
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:56,570
I think people are just like a bit of
Shard and Freud of where famous person

843
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:58,370
who's earning a lot of
money to something stupid.

844
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:05,460
Just wondering how you manage your
client's expectations when you're dealing

845
00:52:06,671 --> 00:52:08,530
with someone who,
so for example,

846
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:12,890
a player that is injury prone and
you're going to see that in the boot

847
00:52:12,891 --> 00:52:17,740
sponsorship deals and then
their appearances, a lot
of that is tied to Dapper,

848
00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:20,320
you know, their parents is
and how you deal with that.

849
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:24,550
It's a really good one.
Um,

850
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:28,870
it depends how you classify
injury prone is the truth.

851
00:52:29,290 --> 00:52:31,810
Now either you do one of
two things as an agent,

852
00:52:31,811 --> 00:52:34,300
you can strategize beforehand to say,
right,

853
00:52:34,301 --> 00:52:36,760
we've got three boot deal
offerings on the table.

854
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:40,390
The retainer amount is
this amount for this club.

855
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:44,590
So for this particular manufacturer we
think an estimate that because over the

856
00:52:44,591 --> 00:52:48,910
last three seasons the players played
25 games per season because either

857
00:52:48,911 --> 00:52:50,770
injuries or form,
whatever it is,

858
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:55,120
we need to try and get to this number
with this amount of appearances that we

859
00:52:55,121 --> 00:52:57,070
think we can get for the
player of the season.

860
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:01,390
So in a way it's a reverse
engineering of the, um,

861
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:05,470
the contractual matrix in
order to make sure that we,

862
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:09,040
that you can get the player over the
line saying this is the amounts that you

863
00:53:09,041 --> 00:53:09,550
may have,

864
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:11,950
but you're probably going to own it and
decimal because of the amount of games

865
00:53:11,951 --> 00:53:14,980
you're going to play.
And ultimately what can sometimes happen,

866
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:17,780
which can help is on the
appearance side watch.

867
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:20,680
But it didn't quite touch
on if you're savvy enough,

868
00:53:20,681 --> 00:53:22,930
what you can actually say to
the boot manufacturers to say,

869
00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:27,780
we're only going to classify
a as particular competitions.

870
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:31,470
Because if you're an elite
athletes elite footballer,

871
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:35,550
you're probably less likely to
play an FAA cup and League Cup.

872
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:39,450
I'm more likely to playing
Champions League and Premier League.

873
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:45,170
So what you would try and do if you're
the elite agent elite player act agent

874
00:53:45,611 --> 00:53:49,990
acting for elite player, you
try and exclude the, the,

875
00:53:50,090 --> 00:53:55,090
the cup competitions to try and ensure
that if appearance is defined as 80% of

876
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:58,650
those games, you're more likely to
be able to hit those benchmarks.

877
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:04,150
