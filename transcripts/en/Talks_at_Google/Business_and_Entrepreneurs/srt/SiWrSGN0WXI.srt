Please welcome to the stage,
the death wish coffee company.

2
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:15,170
So,
uh,

3
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:17,990
there are a lot of you up here and I
know you guys all have very unique and

4
00:00:17,991 --> 00:00:21,230
complicated catered roles inside the
company, so it would probably be best.

5
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:22,300
Why don't you guys just go down the line,

6
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,710
introduce yourself and let
people know what you do.

7
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,560
My name is Mike Brown.
I'm the owner of founders,

8
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:30,980
CEO and chief janitor at Deathwish coffee.

9
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:35,300
Uh, my name is Dustin
Alexander. I do a shipping,

10
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:37,550
I do inventory and I do purchasing.

11
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,860
I'm also part of the podcast with Jeff
to rally on the marketing manager at at

12
00:00:43,521 --> 00:00:44,354
death wish.

13
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,900
Um, came Grogan and I run our
customer service department,

14
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:52,980
some of our events stuff and a
sales wholesale, stuff like that.

15
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:54,750
I'm Jeff airs,

16
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,780
I run our brand new broadcasting division
and I write and edit and produce our

17
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:02,820
weekly podcast fueled by death cast a,

18
00:01:02,821 --> 00:01:06,090
my name is Alyssa hardy and I'm
the content manager at death wish.

19
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,300
So the reason why we brought
Deathwish here today,

20
00:01:09,301 --> 00:01:11,800
and I think it's relevant
to a lot of Googlers, is um,

21
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:16,910
there's this great sort of just like
homecoming king esque type story of

22
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,200
starting out in a basement and just the
explosion of the past five years that

23
00:01:22,201 --> 00:01:25,320
your company has gone through.
Why don't you recap, uh,

24
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:27,150
the history of the company for us?

25
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,620
Yeah.
So back in 2008,

26
00:01:30,621 --> 00:01:34,940
I opened Saratoga coffee traders and
it was a small coffee shop in Saratoga

27
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:35,720
Springs,
New York.

28
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,410
And I learned pretty quickly that I didn't
know how to run a very good business

29
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,280
because I lost all my money. I lost
it all and all my went out the door.

30
00:01:43,281 --> 00:01:48,050
But I was very, um, uh, I
didn't want to be a failure.

31
00:01:48,051 --> 00:01:51,110
So I kept trying and trying and
trying and doing everything I could.

32
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,850
I actually hired my best friend,

33
00:01:52,851 --> 00:01:57,851
Scott to come work with me for basically
free and we just struggled then every

34
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,500
single day we were in that shop trying
to figure out how to make it in a brick

35
00:02:03,501 --> 00:02:06,200
and mortar business.
And then one day or like,

36
00:02:06,201 --> 00:02:09,740
why don't we try to
sell our coffee online?

37
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,710
And that's why we developed a death
wish coffee. And it was, it was a,

38
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,960
a recommendation from our customers
because they would always come in and be

39
00:02:17,961 --> 00:02:20,510
like, Hey, can I have, you know,
give me your strongest coffee.

40
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:24,590
And we'd go and be like, all right, do
they want the darkest coffee? Are they,

41
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:28,430
do they want the most caffeinated
coffee? And we're like, well,

42
00:02:28,431 --> 00:02:31,610
wait a minute and let's just sit down
for a minute and figure this out.

43
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,420
Let's make a coffee that's not only dark,
not only tastes strong,

44
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:39,850
but also has the most caffeine. And, and
that's what we did. You know, we, we, we,

45
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,260
we developed this coffee by just blend.
Will we,

46
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,720
there are a lot of experimentation.

47
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,051
Well,
let's,

48
00:02:46,051 --> 00:02:49,620
let's back up because I do think it's
important to qualify a death wish.

49
00:02:49,621 --> 00:02:52,890
Coffee is known online as the
world's strongest coffee. Yes.

50
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,300
How do you qualify and quantify what
that means to be the world's strongest

51
00:02:57,301 --> 00:03:00,130
coffee? Yeah. You know, I was
never focused caffeine at the

52
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,150
outset. It was always
about taste and flavor. Um,

53
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:08,340
caffeine informer and a few other
publications online, uh, uh,

54
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:12,070
deemed us the world's strongest
coffee with caffeine levels.

55
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:15,930
But I dunno, we personally, I
don't like to focus on that.

56
00:03:15,931 --> 00:03:19,330
It just cause you can brew coffee stronger
by just adding more coffee and using

57
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:23,740
less water. Um, so to me it was all about
flavor and good flavor and, you know, the,

58
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:28,540
and everything that, you
know, when I, when I drink a
cup of coffee in the morning,

59
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,510
I want to wake up. Right.
You know, I want, I want to,

60
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,960
I want it to hit my like taste buds,
the chute open.

61
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,150
That's what I focused on
that, that experience. Um,

62
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:44,020
but going back to your question,
like I said,

63
00:03:44,021 --> 00:03:45,100
I don't like to focus on the caffeine,

64
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:47,440
but caffeine does have
something to do with it. And we,

65
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,650
because we use reboost to beans.
Uh,

66
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,350
reboost beans have between
two and three times the, the,

67
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,040
the typical caffeine content
of Arabica beans. Um,

68
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:00,250
we do naturally get more
caffeine in our club.

69
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,490
Yeah. And that's a big part
of it, right? Because it,

70
00:04:02,491 --> 00:04:05,060
one would think that it would
be easy to make a, you know,

71
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,480
a new world's strongest coffee.

72
00:04:06,481 --> 00:04:10,010
You just go make a coffee and then find
a bunch of caffeine and caffeine. Yeah.

73
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:10,943
So,

74
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:15,120
but that's not really what's going on
you guys or have brewed this batch of

75
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:17,790
beans and roasted in such a way,
uh,

76
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:21,990
to just naturally get this effect without
having to force it. Yup. It's organic.

77
00:04:21,991 --> 00:04:24,150
It's fair trade.
There's no additives.

78
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:29,180
We don't add any caffeine to it or
it's just pure coffee and that's,

79
00:04:30,031 --> 00:04:32,370
you know, we're purists,
believe it or not. And we love,

80
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,030
we love just straight black
drip coffee. Sure. So,

81
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,100
so you find this niche and
you say, okay, I can start,

82
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:45,150
people are demanding a certain thing for
me. The strongest coffee, high caffeine,

83
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:47,090
but also really bold flavor.
Uh,

84
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,200
we got that and we want to
get it out to the people.

85
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:53,070
So you left brick and mortar behind and
just said, we can do this via the web?

86
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,560
Yeah, pretty much. I mean, it's
still in my coffee shop right now.

87
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:00,690
It's doing better, thank
God. But yes, we, we,

88
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,170
we took staff of the online market
cause my customer like, hey,

89
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:07,140
why don't you try selling this online?
And I was like, all right, I'll try.

90
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,890
And you know,
I sold the bag via Google ads.

91
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:14,850
I was how I sold my
first bag and they said,

92
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,870
and I got my first good review. And the
guy was like, I still remember his name,

93
00:05:18,871 --> 00:05:21,960
Phil Bron. Um, how to Oakland.

94
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,400
I filled in horrible. Yeah,
I felt okay the first bag.

95
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:30,480
And he gave me a good review. It's like
this is some strong coffee and it's the,

96
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,140
or some of the best coffee ever had.
And from the air,

97
00:05:34,141 --> 00:05:37,560
like that review lead it up to
another sale and another sale.

98
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:42,770
So I was selling basically one pound a
week and then two pounds a week and three

99
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:43,800
pounds a week.

100
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,800
And all of a sudden it just snowballed
into this company where it was me at

101
00:05:48,901 --> 00:05:53,640
first me and, uh, one of my experts
does Megan. And then one day,

102
00:05:53,641 --> 00:05:55,650
good morning America, give me
a call and they're like, hey,

103
00:05:55,651 --> 00:05:58,850
we've heard about your coffee online,
we want to open the show with it tomorrow.

104
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,060
Can we come up and interview
interview you? And I was like,

105
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:08,060
at that moment, ponder that you'd
think. I would say yes immediately,

106
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:11,900
but I don't know there's
that, it was a, I don't know.

107
00:06:11,901 --> 00:06:16,190
For me it was a great step because I,
I knew I wanted it,

108
00:06:16,191 --> 00:06:19,490
but I didn't know if I was
ready, but I was just like, yes.

109
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,910
And they came that day. I'm
like, when are you going to come?

110
00:06:22,911 --> 00:06:26,240
I was thinking like a week or two. They're
like, we'll be there in three hours.

111
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:30,480
So they good morning America show up at
my store and three hours I closed the

112
00:06:30,481 --> 00:06:30,741
store,

113
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:35,741
I cleaned it up and they interviewed
me and the next morning they open.

114
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,710
Good Morning America drinking death,
wish coffee in our mugs.

115
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,490
And Sam champion was a
weatherman at the time and he,

116
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:46,640
he was our coffee expert and he said,
this is some great coffee.

117
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:51,500
And then from there orders took off. Like,

118
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:56,230
I didn't have enough coffee,
enough bags, enough people. Um,

119
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,400
and that's how basically
higher and everyone,

120
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,300
it's just because it was just me at
the time and I was like, oh my God,

121
00:07:02,301 --> 00:07:04,370
I have all these orders I have to fulfill.

122
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,650
Where am I going to find people to
help me do this? So I went to my co,

123
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,690
my customers and my coffee shop
and I literally asked my customers,

124
00:07:11,691 --> 00:07:16,070
can you help me fulfill these orders? And
that's, and that's where like everyone,

125
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,740
that's where it started and that's
where I found like the greatest people,

126
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,340
which brings us to a lot of you guys.
And the,

127
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,490
the interesting thing I find about that
is it's like you said, you, you pick

128
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,240
bull that you knew or people
who are customers are yours.

129
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,360
You guys are not necessarily
Barista coffee. Hey, related. Yeah.

130
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,460
Yeah. I knew nothing about
marketing though. I mean,

131
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:40,270
I know a little bit about coffee, but, so
how was the, we're skipping a few major,

132
00:07:40,271 --> 00:07:45,210
major points. What are the major? So
one of the things that, um, Mike, uh,

133
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:49,000
as admitted in that, that, you know,
rags to riches story is that, uh,

134
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:52,960
he was looking for a way to supplement
some income because the, um,

135
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:55,780
the coffee shop was failing and you know,

136
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:58,600
he found a product that
worked out and they,

137
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:02,380
him and Megan would just reach out
to massive amounts of just an email.

138
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:04,330
It's like cold emails, like, Hey,
we have the world traumas, coffee.

139
00:08:04,331 --> 00:08:05,740
That's how good morning America found it.

140
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,830
It was literally in a basement and
they were just sending emails and like,

141
00:08:08,831 --> 00:08:12,610
we have this thing and it got mentioned
in a few other publications first.

142
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,630
And then when good morning America came,
um,

143
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:21,480
it was way worse than, than what Mike
just said when all those orders came in.

144
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,320
And,
and I came on at that point,

145
00:08:23,321 --> 00:08:26,920
I'm taking him on a little bit
after that are a good friend,

146
00:08:26,921 --> 00:08:30,490
Eric Donovan was there who,
you know, personally. Um,

147
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,040
and there was thousands
and thousands of orders.

148
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:35,530
And I remember just seeing it there were
in this basement where the floor is not

149
00:08:35,531 --> 00:08:40,450
really finished and it's like shorter
than I am tall and it was just piles and

150
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:43,900
piles of orders and we were like
stickering back's feeling coffee,

151
00:08:43,901 --> 00:08:46,880
like weighing it out one bag at
a time. And it was insane. Um,

152
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,310
we got kicked off of Amazon,

153
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:52,540
we got a lifetime ban off of Ebay
because people thought we were scams. Um,

154
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:55,830
that was interesting.
So it took us what was scammy,

155
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,350
they didn't get their back like
on our website at the time,

156
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,140
which if you could go back there is,
I'm sure you guys know there's you,

157
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:03,210
there's an archive.org or whatever it is,

158
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:06,720
where you can see what the Google
way back machine way back machine.

159
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:08,490
I wouldn't have bought it.

160
00:09:08,491 --> 00:09:10,710
So that's on them cause they
bought it off that website.

161
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:17,280
Slash slash I was a web
developer of that website.

162
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,190
It converted like crazy.
First of all,

163
00:09:20,191 --> 00:09:22,050
the conversion rate on there
is better than it is now.

164
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,210
You'll get it in five days and it's
like three, four weeks. And, and, uh,

165
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,490
we thought it was a dead company.
I didn't get hired for three.

166
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,230
I kept coming back every
day for three months.

167
00:09:31,231 --> 00:09:33,300
I didn't get actually get hired because
we didn't think it was going to be

168
00:09:33,301 --> 00:09:34,710
company after that. Like, well,

169
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:39,090
we just watched the ship sink and a let's
play the titanic song as we go down.

170
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:43,560
And, uh, it wasn't that, you know, we,
we, uh, through customer service, uh,

171
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:46,530
and just apologizing to everybody and
saying, you're going to get it. Um,

172
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,670
people kept ordering.

173
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,710
And then we spent the next year and a
half trying to build a foundation, um,

174
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,580
to the company. Uh, we
moved into a warehouse.

175
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,660
We begged and begged and begged
Amazon and Ebay to let us back on, um,

176
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:01,690
and called me in Amazon. And
I think in on Google too. And,

177
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:02,940
and the Internet for a lot of times,

178
00:10:02,941 --> 00:10:05,550
we're the number one coffee and sometimes
the number one grocery products,

179
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,920
Amazon. So that was just an, a, an a test,

180
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:10,230
a testament to Mike and
him just being like,

181
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,900
we're going to do this the right way.
We're not going to screw people over.

182
00:10:12,901 --> 00:10:14,220
We're not going to, you know, fold.

183
00:10:14,221 --> 00:10:16,950
We're just going to give
everybody what we promised and uh,

184
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:20,970
and we were able to deliver and it was
a pretty amazing time for the company.

185
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:25,320
One of the common threads of
the story, uh, seems to be this,

186
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:29,900
this foundation based around
communication. You guys are very,

187
00:10:29,901 --> 00:10:33,170
very communicative to, like you
said, people were placing an order,

188
00:10:33,171 --> 00:10:34,340
expecting it in five days.

189
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,790
You're then reaching out to them three
weeks later and communicating the delays.

190
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,890
Um, but this is not uncommon. Like
you guys embraced the online space.

191
00:10:42,891 --> 00:10:47,690
You guys embraced so much social media.
Talk about why going that route.

192
00:10:47,691 --> 00:10:51,770
Like it, you could easily have taken out
a loan and spent $100,000 on a marketing

193
00:10:51,771 --> 00:10:55,930
campaign, but going this route, it seems
to have been very effective for you. Yeah.

194
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,500
Our number one value is customer status.

195
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:58,890
And we,
we,

196
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:04,460
I give everyone absolute freedom to
go above and beyond to make sure our

197
00:11:04,711 --> 00:11:09,420
customers are satisfied and happy. And,
and I, I know people say that a lot,

198
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:14,310
especially businesses, but our number
two value is profitability. And it's all,

199
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,530
it's, it's a ranking system. So we will,

200
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,870
because customer satisfaction
is our number one value.

201
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,830
And then to be profitable is, uh,
you know, it's two or three or four,

202
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,910
I can't remember exactly,

203
00:11:23,911 --> 00:11:28,230
but we will take losses to
make our customers happy.

204
00:11:28,231 --> 00:11:31,950
So we'll go above and beyond to do that.

205
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:36,720
One story I'm thinking of it just
pops into my head, uh, is one,

206
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,030
one day a customer called,

207
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:43,320
and he was very upset with our cake gumps
because we had the new k cups and Kira

208
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,140
came out with a new brewer,

209
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:49,980
the Keurig 2.0 and the guy's like,
you know, I bought your cops,

210
00:11:49,981 --> 00:11:52,680
they don't work in my new machine.
And he's like,

211
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:57,850
he was very upset and I'm like, you don't
mess with people's coffee. Yeah, exactly.

212
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:59,980
So I was like, oh, I'm like, how
am I going to fix this problem?

213
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,910
So I talked to the customer
service and they were like, oh,

214
00:12:03,911 --> 00:12:06,310
we can send them another bag.
And I'm like, no, you know,

215
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,620
let's just send them a new,
like a better brewer.

216
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:13,330
So we went and we found that the
top rated a single serve brewer.

217
00:12:13,331 --> 00:12:16,200
And we sent this guy like a brand
new brewer. And it wasn't that,

218
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:20,190
it wasn't a cure. Grand was, it was, I
think it was the ox box and you know,

219
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,420
it was just the top
rated brewer at the time.

220
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:26,290
And we sent that to them and I've never,
and that guy,

221
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:29,740
he turned out to be a CEO of like
some like big construction company.

222
00:12:29,741 --> 00:12:33,850
And he was floored. He
like, you guys are amazing.

223
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:37,180
And to me that's going to say,
I don't know,

224
00:12:37,181 --> 00:12:39,940
that means a lot about my customer
service team that they would think of it

225
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,230
think to do that. And that's what we're
all about, just making people's day,

226
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:47,020
like being able to provide
that type of values.

227
00:12:47,021 --> 00:12:50,290
Who are our customers where
it's not just, um, you know,

228
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,450
here's another bag of cups,
you know, good luck. You know,

229
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:57,220
we want to really
embrace customer service.

230
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:58,050
Well,

231
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:02,250
it seems to go more than just embracing
good customer service because you've

232
00:13:02,251 --> 00:13:05,420
expanded out into social
media in unique ways. Uh,

233
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,130
that again foster communication
and sort of community, uh,

234
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:12,820
which is interesting for a consumable
product company, I think. And,

235
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:16,290
and that sort of leaves us, leads us
into the conversation about the podcast.

236
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,600
So as part of all the social media growth,

237
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:22,800
you guys have created your own
identity and branded a podcast.

238
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:26,320
Yeah, I mean it, Dustin could talk
a little bit more about that. I bet.

239
00:13:26,321 --> 00:13:30,970
But I mean to me like it just seemed
like we want to fuel people's passion.

240
00:13:30,971 --> 00:13:32,230
That's our,
that's our motto.

241
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:37,530
And to do that I feel like we have to be
in contact with them on a regular basis

242
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:41,920
and, and, and sometimes people
are only buying coffee, you
know, once a month. So we,

243
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:45,700
you know, we were thinking how, how can
we be a part of these people's lives, uh,

244
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,010
on an ongoing basis?
And that's where the podcast came in.

245
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:52,100
Yeah. When, um, when Michael first
brought it up, it was, to me,

246
00:13:52,101 --> 00:13:56,090
it was a way to give a
voice for the company. Um,

247
00:13:56,091 --> 00:13:58,850
not only with our employees,

248
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,280
so we do employee interviews,

249
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,560
but also with all the
influencers that we work with.

250
00:14:03,561 --> 00:14:07,250
Because we worked with a
lot of influencers that now
have a voice through the

251
00:14:07,251 --> 00:14:10,190
company with the podcast.
But on top of that, you know,

252
00:14:10,191 --> 00:14:14,870
it gives a little bit more
for the customer to be a
part of the company and also

253
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:19,850
keep really well informed with the
company. There's a clear style,

254
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,250
um,
to the identity of the company.

255
00:14:22,251 --> 00:14:25,940
I mean obviously it's a bold step
to call yourself Deathwish coffee.

256
00:14:25,941 --> 00:14:29,630
Why would you want to actively drink
something that is threatening your life?

257
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:32,930
But that sort of fear behind
that. I do. Absolutely.

258
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,520
Um,

259
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:38,870
so the whole thought of the name
and the image of the coffee is,

260
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:42,210
I was,
you know,

261
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,840
when it's coming up
with death wish coffee,

262
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,690
I was sitting there was that night,

263
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,300
so imagine me sitting in a room at night,

264
00:14:50,301 --> 00:14:54,350
it's dark out have is this computer screen
in front of me and I was in my second

265
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:59,000
floor apartment and pour as
broke as a joke. Like I hadn't,

266
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:03,410
it's so boring. And I'm
like, I'm like, how, what,

267
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,790
what am I, what? I had this
product in mind and like,

268
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:12,170
how do I put this on a screen?
And I looked down at this can I was,

269
00:15:12,171 --> 00:15:15,720
I was drinking a four Loko at the time.
All right.

270
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:20,120
That works for local at the time.
And I'm like, who is he? I had on it,

271
00:15:20,121 --> 00:15:22,430
had a picture of is a mean dog.

272
00:15:22,431 --> 00:15:26,100
And my girlfriend and bought me this
Cousy when she went away on vacation and I

273
00:15:26,101 --> 00:15:29,720
said Deathwish under it. And I'm like,
ah, I mean that's, that's a cool,

274
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,700
that's a pretty cool like name I could,
I could,

275
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:36,140
I could go with that for a name of this
coffee. And I'm like, how am I going to,

276
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,440
what would I want to see if I walked
into somebody's kitchen? Like,

277
00:15:39,441 --> 00:15:42,500
if I saw bad coffee, what would I pick
up and look at it and be intrigued by,

278
00:15:42,501 --> 00:15:46,130
and I had this image of a poisoned, like
a poisoned bottle, like an old school,

279
00:15:46,131 --> 00:15:50,150
like poison via, like we'd pick
up and be like, what is like,

280
00:15:50,151 --> 00:15:54,190
what kind of coffee are you drinking
with this poisoned label on it? Uh,

281
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,480
and that was the whole concept behind it.
And I was like,

282
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:00,360
Deathwish poisoned while this could, this
could work. So, you know, I did some,

283
00:16:00,361 --> 00:16:02,630
like I wanted to Photoshop and
like Photoshop some stuff around.

284
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:06,940
And so like I got the preliminary
logo. It's not the logo. It is now. Um,

285
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,920
I'm putting in my risk is actually
have the logo on my wrists,

286
00:16:09,921 --> 00:16:14,330
which it's just not a temporary tents.
There are tattoos but um,

287
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:17,690
tattoos of it. Yes, that poisoned logo.

288
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:21,070
That's the whole image I had in mind
in my brain at the time. And it,

289
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,650
well, it's fed so much into the
larger identity at this point.

290
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,100
You guys with the podcasts
of really embracing this,

291
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:32,190
and I know you're a big into MMA and
you guys have some influencers from that

292
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,710
space that in rock and roll and yeah,

293
00:16:34,711 --> 00:16:39,711
I mean that whole area of Edgy
influencers has just opened up to us.

294
00:16:40,081 --> 00:16:44,250
It becomes like a lifestyle brand.
And a certain point pretty early on,

295
00:16:44,251 --> 00:16:48,240
it became a lifestyle brand. We realized,
and I don't think it was the intent,

296
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:51,570
if you look at some of our original ads,
it was Leno,

297
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,140
a lawyer who can't wake up in the morning.
So he like drinks the coffee.

298
00:16:55,141 --> 00:16:57,750
But we found out that our number one
people that were spreading the word,

299
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:00,930
we're either like, you know,
musicians are recovered,

300
00:17:00,931 --> 00:17:05,070
addicts who wanted something to kind of
sink your teeth into and a brand that

301
00:17:05,071 --> 00:17:08,040
really spoke to them. And, and
so many people drink coffee.

302
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:11,040
It's a number two commodity
in the world behind oil. Um,

303
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:15,060
and we had the igs most badass brand and
when we started this thing, there was,

304
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:18,990
when Mike started, there wasn't a world
tour on this coffee. Now you can Google.

305
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,160
It's weird up here.
Say that.

306
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:29,040
Yeah, you can search on the
Internet. You, it's kind of cool,

307
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:32,250
but you can and you see so many different
people claiming to have that claim and

308
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:33,680
they have our, you know, uh,

309
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,920
one of my favorite stories is we see so
many websites that try to like knock us

310
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,371
off.

311
00:17:38,371 --> 00:17:43,371
And there was one that used our exact
html html code and didn't take the bottom

312
00:17:44,971 --> 00:17:48,990
off. So it said, why try
Deathwish click here and our,

313
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,890
and it was, it was also effectively
signing people up for your email.

314
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:58,860
And actually we collected email
address postures. Once they failed,

315
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,280
they had their, our bag with their
logo photoshops and top of it.

316
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:05,490
And we would email them and
be like, that's our bag. And
they're like, no, it's not.

317
00:18:05,491 --> 00:18:07,350
It's like, it has our address on
it, on the side of it, the bag.

318
00:18:07,351 --> 00:18:10,770
And that you still couldn't hear your
website? We have Photoshop. Yeah, it was,

319
00:18:10,771 --> 00:18:11,970
it was ridiculous. But, um,

320
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:14,300
it speaking to it being a lifestyle brand,

321
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:17,600
I mean there are people who walk our
shirts and our hats and everything like

322
00:18:17,601 --> 00:18:21,590
that without actually even
trying the coffee. So, and
get tattoos and get tattoos.

323
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:24,890
Um, people who've, they've probably
tried the coffee at that point though.

324
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,120
That's okay.

325
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:31,250
I'd hope so. You've mentioned tattoo
seventh, sorry to cut that off. Were you?

326
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,400
Oh, I mean, yeah. So we have a few of
our biggest fans definitely have, um,

327
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:40,280
our logo tattooed on them, which is
insane. People crying all the time.

328
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:45,410
They say, Hey, we want to get
your logo tattooed. Is that okay?

329
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,720
Well that's a big commitment,
you know, we're never like,

330
00:18:47,721 --> 00:18:50,480
oh just go ahead and do it. It's kind
of like pretty sure you want to do this.

331
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,960
You know, we do try and kind of talk
them down, but it is pretty cool.

332
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,540
You guys just finished the New York
City Tattoo? Yes. Yeah. Did anybody,

333
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:03,670
did you watch anybody get a death? Which
Tattoo? No. No actually we weren't going.

334
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:06,000
I mean, I mean it's, it's
tough. It's a weird term just to

335
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:11,570
temporary. Yeah. I always, we always
joke after they get it. Like, Oh,

336
00:19:11,571 --> 00:19:13,550
let's talk about actually selling our
name. We're going to be something else.

337
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,003
When I was in Santa,

338
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:20,240
very early became a lifestyle brand and
one of our first marketing campaigns, um,

339
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:24,020
was, you know, what fuels you,
you are a field by death. Um,

340
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:26,950
and that kind of to kind of skip
forward back to the podcast, which,

341
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,600
which started a few months ago.
And Jeff is also the cost to that.

342
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:31,650
And he kind of headed that whole project.
Um,

343
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:35,540
we found out very early on that it
wasn't just, you know, musicians and,

344
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:39,920
and all these people, it was a engineers.
It was, you know, comic book artists,

345
00:19:39,921 --> 00:19:42,710
nurses, you know, passionate people
about what they do for a living room.

346
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,970
And there are Olympians

347
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,540
fueled by death isn't just an idea of,
you know,

348
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:51,080
what is your coffee and coffee I like,
we keep saying as a lifestyle,

349
00:19:51,081 --> 00:19:53,420
but fueled by death is every
single one of us in this room,

350
00:19:53,421 --> 00:19:57,590
every single one of us outside of this
room on this planet wants to do something

351
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:02,210
significant before we leave this planet
for good. Because death is inevitable.

352
00:20:02,211 --> 00:20:06,800
Whether you get hit by a bus in five
minutes or you live to be 90 years old.

353
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,080
And what's interesting is,

354
00:20:09,081 --> 00:20:14,081
is that everybody in the world
enjoys figuring that out.

355
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,910
Whether it's or hard,
you know,

356
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,180
journey to get there or it's something
that you know you're passionate about and

357
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:24,900
it's very interesting to
attack a conversation that
way. And that's where the,

358
00:20:24,901 --> 00:20:27,320
the idea of this podcast
Kinda came back about.

359
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,540
And it's interesting to be able to bring
it to a business and because we're not

360
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:33,860
sitting there and being like,
well,

361
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,370
what kind of coffee do you like and
why does that fuel you real quick?

362
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:40,970
What that would get boring. It would
get incredibly boring. But I mean,

363
00:20:40,971 --> 00:20:44,000
like we've talked to, you know,
astronauts and rock stars and,

364
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,700
and normal people and like, why are you,
what gets you out of bed in the morning?

365
00:20:48,701 --> 00:20:52,990
Why do you get out of bed in the morning
and what gets you out of bed the next

366
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:56,140
morning? Why? Why are you doing it? Not
the coffee. There's, there's something,

367
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:59,680
there's something that you're passionate
about. And that conversation is always,

368
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:02,350
will never not be interesting.
You know? And that's,

369
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:06,040
and that's kind of what we are all
about as a lifestyle brand too.

370
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:11,280
Because what's fun about a coffee
company is coffee is a lifestyle.

371
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:15,670
I all of you out there probably have
you own way that you drink coffee and it

372
00:21:15,671 --> 00:21:16,750
becomes your morning ritual,

373
00:21:16,751 --> 00:21:19,450
whether it's just putting it in a drip
machine and hitting the brew button or

374
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,810
we're going to a gas station or
ruined and you know, taking out your,

375
00:21:22,811 --> 00:21:25,990
your chemistry set and really
making that perfect cup of coffee,

376
00:21:25,991 --> 00:21:28,300
like whatever it is that is your path,

377
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,460
that your passion for your
coffee at that moment.

378
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,070
But after you drink your coffee,
then your day starts, you know,

379
00:21:33,071 --> 00:21:36,460
and then what are you doing with your day?
And we want to be a part of your day,

380
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:39,370
not just in that, in that
beginning of it, you know,

381
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:43,550
it's a, it's a, it's a great
narrative to hear about the passion,

382
00:21:43,551 --> 00:21:44,950
the seeking passion in,

383
00:21:44,951 --> 00:21:47,120
in the people who are around
you in a part of that lifestyle.

384
00:21:47,121 --> 00:21:50,330
And then equating that back to what you
went through to actually get this thing

385
00:21:50,331 --> 00:21:53,840
up off the ground. Uh,
looking back at it now,

386
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:58,010
were there times when you thought,
you know what, this isn't worth it,

387
00:21:58,011 --> 00:22:01,340
or were there times that you had to
like refine that passion and yourself of

388
00:22:01,341 --> 00:22:03,080
like,
we can make this work?

389
00:22:03,081 --> 00:22:06,890
I do want to do it even though it's
early on with the, with the coffee shop,

390
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,980
I believe when I started death,

391
00:22:08,981 --> 00:22:13,360
wish I was probably only probably one
or two months from closing the doors

392
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,690
because it was, it was, I just didn't
have any money left and I ate them.

393
00:22:16,691 --> 00:22:19,840
I had my car repoed and how to
sell my house I was living with,

394
00:22:19,841 --> 00:22:23,080
I had to move back into,
my mom has lived in behind the garage,

395
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:28,060
so I was very close to calling
it quits and just, you know,

396
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:32,200
but I am super, I try to be like,
I didn't want to be a failure,

397
00:22:32,201 --> 00:22:34,690
you know what I mean? That
to me, like that word.

398
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:38,230
And it's funny I think back and people,
my friends and family, Hey Mike,

399
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:40,840
how's things over to the coffee shop? And
every time like, oh, they're going great.

400
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:45,040
Thanks for asking. But deep inside I was
just like, I'm crashing and burning here.

401
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:49,960
Oh No. So yeah.

402
00:22:49,961 --> 00:22:53,290
So after that I'm they know, I'm like,
oh, I gotta try something. So yeah,

403
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:57,250
the online, once the online sales
started to pick up, I'm like holy crap.

404
00:22:57,251 --> 00:23:01,720
Like maybe I can keep this thing open
a little bit longer. And I'm like,

405
00:23:01,721 --> 00:23:04,090
if I had just made like
5,000 bucks a year,

406
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:08,020
that's pretty much all I
need to like make things.

407
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:11,950
If I had worked a little longer. So yeah,
there was that time where it's almost,

408
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:17,590
I was at the absolute, you know, ready
to ready to call it quits. But yeah,

409
00:23:17,591 --> 00:23:20,920
we hung on night.
I kept going with it and then I was just,

410
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:25,660
am I gonna pay my bills back someday?
I guess, you know? And I did. So

411
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,330
you want to speak about
something specific, which is,

412
00:23:29,331 --> 00:23:33,920
I would like for you guys to talk about
the super bowl ad and how that came to

413
00:23:33,921 --> 00:23:38,790
pass because I think it's a testament to
your activity on social media space and,

414
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,360
and how hard you guys work
to build that community.

415
00:23:41,361 --> 00:23:44,840
And then not actually that community
paying you back. Interesting.

416
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:46,550
We the greatest fans,

417
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:51,620
community customers in the world,
hands down like date.

418
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:53,690
When we keep going back to lifestyle,

419
00:23:53,691 --> 00:23:56,510
we keep talking about that they
made it a lifestyle. You know,

420
00:23:56,511 --> 00:23:59,630
they made this brand what it is,
they're the reason why we,

421
00:23:59,631 --> 00:24:03,500
we got the Superbowl commercial in the
first place because it was a, it was,

422
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:06,290
it's a, uh, small business, big game.

423
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:12,190
So basically intuit quickbooks put out
a contest for a small business with less

424
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:17,291
than I think 50 employees and about
15,000 businesses actually entered them.

425
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:20,450
They were one of them. Um, and
it was a vote based contest.

426
00:24:20,451 --> 00:24:24,620
So basically you would ask your
community to vote for you, click,

427
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,260
click a very simple link.
Um,

428
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:30,750
and essentially the contest
was very simple. Uh,

429
00:24:30,751 --> 00:24:33,320
the person with the most votes would win.
Um,

430
00:24:33,321 --> 00:24:36,650
so it ended up being narrowed down
to I think a few hundred and then,

431
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:40,970
and then 10. And that was insane.
I mean, at 15,000, we had no idea.

432
00:24:40,971 --> 00:24:44,060
But coming back to the, the failure
of conversation that you're having.

433
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:49,270
I think that was the first time where
we kind of said if if we don't win this,

434
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:50,561
that would suck.

435
00:24:50,561 --> 00:24:54,310
Like it felt like it would be a setback
and it was almost are put so much work

436
00:24:54,311 --> 00:24:58,070
into it. So much work into it. It felt
like it would be the end of the world.

437
00:24:58,071 --> 00:25:01,130
And I think that is one of the
reasons why we ended up winning,

438
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,900
cause we put 100% of our focus on
winning the competition. It sounds silly,

439
00:25:05,901 --> 00:25:10,901
but it really brought our art team
together like that one driving purpose and

440
00:25:11,151 --> 00:25:14,120
everyday we'd start, it would be big.
How are we going to get more votes today?

441
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,830
How are we going to get more votes today?
Yup.

442
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:20,990
And it came down to us and Chubbies and
[inaudible] is a five and dime out of

443
00:25:20,991 --> 00:25:24,410
Buffalo, New York. Great small little
store. They had all of Buffalo,

444
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:27,140
all 6 million people in buffalo
behind him voting every day. Yeah.

445
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:30,150
And they were a brick and
mortar shop that would sell.

446
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:35,210
So find a tiny figurines
and Chinese you want to win.

447
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,800
They were like, we don't want, what

448
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:40,130
do we do if we went and,
and intuit did tell us after,

449
00:25:40,131 --> 00:25:42,590
I don't know if I should say this, but
they were like, if someone like that one,

450
00:25:42,591 --> 00:25:45,950
we would ever do this kindness again
because there's no way to quantify that or

451
00:25:45,951 --> 00:25:49,280
help that out. But, um, it
was, it was insane. You know,

452
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:52,130
the first three months it was six months
competition and the first three months

453
00:25:52,131 --> 00:25:56,630
where it started with 15,000 and I
honestly didn't think you have a chance.

454
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:59,030
We were seven employees at the
time. We're going again, some,

455
00:25:59,031 --> 00:26:01,520
some juggernauts of companies.
I mean, for instance,

456
00:26:01,521 --> 00:26:05,990
Chubbies shorts while they have a little
less than 50 employees stay at 125

457
00:26:05,991 --> 00:26:09,890
college brand ambassadors spreading
the word, which aren't on the books,

458
00:26:09,891 --> 00:26:14,820
which I think that's cheating. That's just
my opinion. A victim. Um, but one that,

459
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,750
those guys are good guys. They're
cool. They're cool. Um, but when,

460
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:21,650
when they said we want the top 10, it
became very real. Um, and then it's like,

461
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,750
okay, we did a lot of work.
I'm going to this point.

462
00:26:23,751 --> 00:26:26,120
But we were kind of like still doing
our day to day stuff once they're like,

463
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:28,690
you guys are one of 10. And
they basically picked, you know,

464
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:30,470
you had to have a
community of people voting,

465
00:26:30,471 --> 00:26:33,590
but they also picked really good stories.
Like one,

466
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:36,770
some of the people we are going
against in the top 10 were like, uh,

467
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:40,160
this Harvard business person,
uh, this, this awesome,

468
00:26:40,161 --> 00:26:43,620
awesome chick was trying
to solve world hunger by a,

469
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:46,790
you put your fruit and whatever on
this paper. And it would, it would, uh,

470
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:51,150
make it last longer. And it's like,
we're just sell coffee. We're going,

471
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,550
it's amazing,
amazing stories and amazing companies.

472
00:26:53,551 --> 00:26:56,790
And all 10 of them were
very incredible stories.

473
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:59,970
So when we actually want it,
um, we, you know, it was,

474
00:26:59,971 --> 00:27:03,180
it was the first time we came
together as a team and it really,

475
00:27:03,181 --> 00:27:05,760
team is the most important thing that you
can really do anything you want to do.

476
00:27:05,761 --> 00:27:07,560
You just have to meet him.
Everyone bought in.

477
00:27:07,561 --> 00:27:11,170
And that I think we realize that we
can accomplish pretty much anything if,

478
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,600
if we,
I mean it sounds so cliche,

479
00:27:12,601 --> 00:27:15,900
but if you put your mind to it and every
day I'm like, it would be like, you know,

480
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:19,110
what is, what $7 million worth of
heat, what would you do for $7 million?

481
00:27:19,111 --> 00:27:20,820
Cause that's essentially
what you're getting.

482
00:27:20,821 --> 00:27:22,110
You're getting a $7 million commercial.

483
00:27:22,111 --> 00:27:23,790
When we were going to
be set as a business,

484
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,490
if we could just figure out
how to win this thing. And uh,

485
00:27:26,491 --> 00:27:29,910
it was a lot of pressure and there were
months where we didn't have a day off.

486
00:27:29,911 --> 00:27:33,160
We're already going to every event like,
um, me and Mike would go to a literal,

487
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:35,610
you know, football game and
just hand out things like, yeah,

488
00:27:35,611 --> 00:27:39,090
we're a coffee company.
Both here's, and in Buffalo.

489
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:41,810
And we didn't realize we were going
against those guys. But Tana is tailored,

490
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,550
had our march, she is the head of
our marketing. So she had, okay,

491
00:27:44,551 --> 00:27:46,890
let's try this today. Let's try
this today. We're, we're not there,

492
00:27:46,891 --> 00:27:48,600
we're not winning.
And it was insane.

493
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:52,980
I would say that if we didn't establish
customer service as our number one value

494
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,830
way before this competition,

495
00:27:55,831 --> 00:27:58,920
I don't think we would have won because
it wouldn't have resonated with our fans

496
00:27:58,921 --> 00:28:01,470
are with our community
at all. Um, and they,

497
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:06,471
we have made it a point to involve
them with the company the entire time.

498
00:28:08,101 --> 00:28:10,590
So I think that kind of
set us up. Um, you know,

499
00:28:10,591 --> 00:28:14,640
our fans would when contact us and say,
Hey, wait, I said a calendar invite on my,

500
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:18,870
on my calendar so that I remember to
vote for every day, every single day. Um,

501
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:22,380
I created a separate mailing list,
um, opt in for people. You know,

502
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:25,500
we would send one a day and almost
no one on subscribe from that list,

503
00:28:25,501 --> 00:28:28,890
which is insane. And the open rates and
the click rates were incredible. Um,

504
00:28:28,891 --> 00:28:33,090
so our community, um, and just placing,
placing them on top of our values,

505
00:28:33,091 --> 00:28:35,550
I think is the most important
thing that we ever did.

506
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:40,110
We never knew it would have actually come
back to us. And it's such a great way

507
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:43,830
being real and genuine also. And
one of the things that, you know,

508
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:47,690
Mike and Tana found out early on where
they want people want it to see, you know,

509
00:28:47,691 --> 00:28:51,860
your faces they have, you're now
their favorite coffee brand. Um,

510
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,600
and they, we made, you know,

511
00:28:53,601 --> 00:28:56,900
our brand very relatable like none of
us have experienced in any of the things

512
00:28:56,901 --> 00:29:00,980
we have jobs and now, you know, um,
most of us didn't graduate from college.

513
00:29:00,981 --> 00:29:04,980
We basically googled business.

514
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:08,780
Thanks guys. Yeah, no,

515
00:29:08,781 --> 00:29:11,210
but seriously it was literally
like we had a Google education.

516
00:29:11,211 --> 00:29:13,370
I know you guys probably heard that and
it might be one of those weird trigger

517
00:29:13,371 --> 00:29:16,940
things like Ugh,
but we did do one social media,

518
00:29:16,941 --> 00:29:20,900
how do you want an ad campaign and how do
you deal do it today. We still do that.

519
00:29:20,901 --> 00:29:22,640
And because of that we
were able to kind of like,

520
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:26,780
we didn't have a whole 20 years of, of
experience and like this is the way it is,

521
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:27,643
where we're going to go.

522
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:30,860
A lot of those dinosaurs fall
at the times we are at the time.

523
00:29:30,861 --> 00:29:33,770
It's like we literally grew
up in this age, in this era,

524
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:37,220
and we figured out how to do
everything by just searching it online.

525
00:29:37,221 --> 00:29:40,820
And it's an a test like a testament
to the power of what you guys do,

526
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:42,010
which is incredible.
And

527
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,410
uh, that's kind of where we are,
why we are where we are today.

528
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:47,500
And it is a story of a very meteoric rise,

529
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:52,480
a very short time period to go from
the brick and mortar basement roasting.

530
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,840
You know, coming up with the
recipe to where you are now,

531
00:29:55,841 --> 00:29:58,900
where it's the line is diversified.
Like you said,

532
00:29:58,901 --> 00:30:02,050
you're making everything from whole being
to like k cups that people come by and

533
00:30:02,051 --> 00:30:03,040
just pop in a machine.

534
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:07,960
I want to have you guys
speak to somewhere out there,

535
00:30:07,961 --> 00:30:12,250
maybe here it's a Googler or maybe it's
somebody who's watching the video at

536
00:30:12,251 --> 00:30:15,970
home that has their thing,
their passion, and they want it,

537
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:19,150
they want a similar kind of experience.
What would you tell them?

538
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:22,920
How would you advise them to,
to get involved in that too?

539
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:27,640
Maybe not mimic what you guys have
done but at least be on that path.

540
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,150
Yeah,
I mean just go for it.

541
00:30:30,151 --> 00:30:33,900
And when you feel like you're getting
uncomfortable and just push a little

542
00:30:33,901 --> 00:30:37,110
further because I feel like,
you know,

543
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:40,950
thinking back that point in my life,
I almost quit.

544
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,800
I was that close to success.
You know what I mean?

545
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:47,460
I was that close and I did
just push a little bit further.

546
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:52,080
So whenever you're doing or if
you have a passion, go for it.

547
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:55,050
And right when you get to that point
we were about to quit is it'd be like,

548
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:58,260
actually no, I'm going to push
myself, you know, two for there.

549
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:03,180
And I think that if everyone did that,
which is a little bit more persistent,

550
00:31:03,181 --> 00:31:05,730
like the things you can
accomplish are amazing.

551
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:10,010
Do you guys agree?
I mean the podcast creators who are here,

552
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:13,310
you guys just started doing it,
right? Yeah. I ain't know where.

553
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:17,330
And you guys have now grown
to a fairly decent presence,

554
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:21,120
GL and baby cas, just 30 episodes
out right now. But I mean, yeah,

555
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:25,670
it's one thing I say about this company
and this really works towards any kind

556
00:31:25,671 --> 00:31:28,760
of anything, anything you're
passionate about is that, you know,

557
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:32,180
this company Deathwish coffee is,
I always equate it to a living,

558
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:36,770
breathing organism.
It's something that learns every day.

559
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:39,380
It's not just coffee, it's
not just the brand. It's,

560
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:44,030
it's what we're trying to achieve,
what we're trying to do and anything,

561
00:31:44,031 --> 00:31:48,050
whether it's the video game you like or,
or you know,

562
00:31:48,051 --> 00:31:49,700
the hobby that you're creating.
You know,

563
00:31:49,701 --> 00:31:53,870
when your workshop at home or the job
that you have to go to day in and day out,

564
00:31:53,871 --> 00:31:55,520
there's always another journey.

565
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,580
There's always another path you
can take to get to the goal.

566
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,240
The goal is just there,
but that's never the finish line.

567
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:05,210
There's never a finish line. And we talk
about that a lot on the podcast. In fact,

568
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:09,290
one of the influencers of the company
said it the best and we quote him probably

569
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,710
every single time. It doesn't knows who
I'm going to say. Yeah, you did. Yeah.

570
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:17,600
Naked and afraid. Um, he said it the best.
You said you either win or you learn.

571
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:21,590
There is no losing, there's
never losing. And, and there's,

572
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:25,400
and when you win there's more
to go. You know, and that's,

573
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:30,050
that's a testament to what we do.
But it's a testament to what you all do,

574
00:32:30,051 --> 00:32:33,530
what anybody can do. And I think
that's, I think that's powerful.

575
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:36,770
And just to speak on what,
what Michael brought up,

576
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:40,310
Jeff and I were podcasting
before we started

577
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:43,420
podcasting for the company.
We had our own little mini podcast,

578
00:32:43,421 --> 00:32:45,650
but we were kind of hitting the end
of the road there where it was like,

579
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:47,900
is this done?
Are we done with this?

580
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,440
And we decided we were
going to hang on to it.

581
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,470
And then that's when Mike was like, well,
why don't you do it for the company?

582
00:32:54,471 --> 00:32:59,360
And it was like, yeah, let's do it. Let's
get it together. Now we have a vision. We,

583
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:04,040
you know, we have a focus
and we now, it's been great.

584
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,280
It's been amazing. It's been an amazing
trip and it's been very short so far

585
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:10,900
and we're not even, we're not
even started, you know, I mean,

586
00:33:10,901 --> 00:33:12,910
we started out doing the idea of the,
hey,

587
00:33:12,911 --> 00:33:15,310
let's have a weekly podcast where
people can learn about the company,

588
00:33:15,311 --> 00:33:18,750
but we can also, you know, ask
those questions to influencers and,

589
00:33:18,751 --> 00:33:21,220
and interesting people
and the employees as well.

590
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:25,120
But now we're adding video
and we're adding live video.

591
00:33:25,121 --> 00:33:29,200
We're doing Facebook lives and we're
doing, um, as we do it and live,

592
00:33:29,201 --> 00:33:34,120
I'm learning how to do TV
tricks as we're going live.

593
00:33:34,121 --> 00:33:39,121
So I'm on camera talking to you and also
putting camera two on as it's happening

594
00:33:39,311 --> 00:33:42,970
with other graphics and I'm failing,
but I'm doing better at it.

595
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:48,640
Yeah.
So I mean like there's always new ideas.

596
00:33:48,641 --> 00:33:52,600
There's always new ways to like not
even just, it's not improving something,

597
00:33:52,601 --> 00:33:57,340
it's just going farther, going that
extra step, you know, like it's,

598
00:33:57,341 --> 00:33:58,720
it's awesome and it's always going to be

599
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:03,510
tough when you're breaking ground. I
mean, we're doing things that no other co,

600
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:05,280
especially coffee companies are doing.

601
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:10,020
No other coffee companies are making a
podcast like we're doing it or you know,

602
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:14,370
making comic books like we do.
Um, but when you break ground,

603
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:17,430
nobody's been there before. You
can't just Google it, you know,

604
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,100
how do I start a podcast and make
it a live show on Facebook live?

605
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,630
You're not going to get an answer.
So it's,

606
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,340
it's just a nature of the
beast of breaking ground.

607
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:29,160
You're going to have to figure out
stuff that nobody's figured out yet,

608
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,110
but that's where the success comes from.

609
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,320
Gone back to Mike's Story. I think
this is really important. Um,

610
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:37,400
like mentioned pushing past your,
um,

611
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:42,030
uncomfortable point. I'm making a
list of your worst case scenario.

612
00:34:42,031 --> 00:34:46,100
I know that's what Mike definitely did
and I'm weighing whether or not those

613
00:34:46,101 --> 00:34:48,950
things are worse than
failing business wise. Um,

614
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:52,610
I know Mike made a list of best and worst
case scenario and all of them ended up

615
00:34:52,611 --> 00:34:57,000
happening, um, mom's place,
et Cetera, et cetera.

616
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,170
Um, but you do kind of have to
push past that a little bit.

617
00:35:00,171 --> 00:35:02,060
So I do think going back
to your original question,

618
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:05,120
make a list of the worst things
that could possibly happen.

619
00:35:05,121 --> 00:35:09,650
And if you're okay with those things
happening at the expense of creating an

620
00:35:09,651 --> 00:35:12,920
amazing business and just, just
try it out, we'll definitely work.

621
00:35:12,921 --> 00:35:15,290
But at least you'll know, you'll
know what's to come. I mean,

622
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:19,430
worst case scenario is not doing
it at all. Right. That's true.

623
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,890
Part of the, uh, what we
kind of omitted from this,

624
00:35:21,891 --> 00:35:25,130
this kind of rags to riches
story is Mike had a career.

625
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,770
He had his masters in accounting.
He wasn't accounted for.

626
00:35:27,771 --> 00:35:31,340
The state worked for the state had seen
all these people that do this thing

627
00:35:31,341 --> 00:35:33,660
where they show up everyday to
work and they're just like, yeah,

628
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,350
no one's really happy. No one's,
there's nothing really driving them.

629
00:35:36,351 --> 00:35:38,760
They're just like kind
of, you know, or robotic.

630
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:41,630
They just get up and they
drink their coffee. Uh,

631
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:43,520
and then they go to work
and they do their thing.

632
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:46,200
They go home and they go to bed and
he's like, you know, I hate this.

633
00:35:46,201 --> 00:35:49,380
I want to do something I like.
And I liked being in coffee shops.

634
00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:52,200
I don't know much about coffee, but I
can figure it out. And then, you know,

635
00:35:52,201 --> 00:35:57,201
a lot of us were at crossroads in life
and we kind of joined the team and I

636
00:35:57,571 --> 00:36:01,020
would say that the most important
thing is just never settling. Um,

637
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,000
I know that like, so he, he had a career,

638
00:36:03,001 --> 00:36:05,970
he didn't like it and just try something
else. And it took him, you know,

639
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:08,520
took five or six years
before everyone told him.

640
00:36:08,521 --> 00:36:12,680
It was like the worst thing were sitting.
He was gonna make. Um, I personally,

641
00:36:12,681 --> 00:36:15,270
and I dropped out of community
college three times. I was a banker.

642
00:36:15,271 --> 00:36:19,700
I had the whole career in banking when I
was in my early twenties. I hated it. Um,

643
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,890
I quit my, uh, family and friends
saw me. It was the worst decision.

644
00:36:22,891 --> 00:36:27,891
I moved back to upstate New York and I
ended up basically homeless for a while.

645
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:34,440
His couch couch. I would be spent a lot
of time with Matt and his beautiful wife.

646
00:36:34,441 --> 00:36:37,140
And it was, it was a very, very dark time,

647
00:36:37,141 --> 00:36:39,750
but I found Deathwish and
it's just seizing opportunity.

648
00:36:39,751 --> 00:36:43,260
And now tell has got similar stories
unless I worked for a teen vogue I think

649
00:36:43,261 --> 00:36:46,170
for a little while she still
does and we've all done things.

650
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:50,000
Who for a kitchen you worked for
a kitchen. Like it was, you know,

651
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:54,540
a lot of different times where we just
weren't happy with our current situation

652
00:36:54,541 --> 00:36:55,770
and a lot of people settle.

653
00:36:55,771 --> 00:36:58,620
And I think that's the biggest mistake
you can make it just dealing with it

654
00:36:58,621 --> 00:37:02,100
because you think that's all you got and
just looking for opportunities and and

655
00:37:02,101 --> 00:37:04,730
uh, and when they're there,
you know, doors will open.

656
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,030
You just have to know
to walk through them.

657
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,310
Hmm. Very good. Very good.

658
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:11,610
I do want to leave plenty of time for
you guys to ask questions as well.

659
00:37:11,611 --> 00:37:14,080
There are microphones in the
aisles so I encourage you to,

660
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,390
to make your way to the microphone.

661
00:37:15,391 --> 00:37:18,360
So with your questions prepared
while people are getting ready,

662
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:19,650
I want you guys to go down the line.

663
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:21,660
I don't want you to tell me
how you take your coffee.

664
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:28,060
Yes. I take my coffee out of a
Chemex, typically black, no sugar,

665
00:37:28,061 --> 00:37:30,130
no cream,
strong as you can make it,

666
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:34,640
but I only drink it in the morning.
I get a little weirder with it.

667
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:38,900
I uh, I make something called death
proof coffee, which is mixed with butter,

668
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,850
MCT oil, blended. Um, I stick
a few other things in there.

669
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:48,170
Um, but yeah, that's, that's my
morning ritual. One Cup in the morning.

670
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,170
I'm good to go all day.
Typically.

671
00:37:51,171 --> 00:37:55,100
I mean actually came in as like a coffee
connoisseur and it was such a brat.

672
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:59,960
I still loved the third wave coffee,
but um, typically black, but you'll,

673
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:03,680
you'll catch me going to the Keurig
a lot more than it. So here I am.

674
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,230
I have, uh, two different, uh,

675
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:10,540
kinds where it's like I have my hangover
on Sunday where just like really just

676
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:13,630
terrible diner coffee with a
bunch of cream and sugar. Um,

677
00:38:13,631 --> 00:38:18,010
I've also figured out through this job,
I didn't know much about coffee. We see,

678
00:38:18,011 --> 00:38:21,010
use it as a literal,
a utility to get you through your day.

679
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,830
A lot of people will drink an
energy drink or something like that.

680
00:38:23,831 --> 00:38:24,730
And they would always be like,
dude,

681
00:38:24,731 --> 00:38:28,150
there's more caffeine in coffee than
there is in that. You don't need that.

682
00:38:28,151 --> 00:38:33,010
It's terrible for you. Um, so I usually
have three cups, uh, between eight and 11.

683
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:37,090
Um, and it, it'll me to where the
till about three where I started that,

684
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:41,020
that a crash and then I'll have one more
cup cause I allows me to go home and

685
00:38:41,021 --> 00:38:42,040
get stuff done afterward.

686
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:46,630
So I used to be cream and sugar all
the time and then I got really lazy in

687
00:38:46,631 --> 00:38:49,570
college.
So it's black and it's a lot.

688
00:38:49,571 --> 00:38:51,910
I drink probably five or six cups a day.

689
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:56,110
My desk is directly next to all of our
coffee machines and I'm bouncing off the

690
00:38:56,111 --> 00:38:58,510
walls by five and he never shuts up.
He never shuts up.

691
00:38:58,511 --> 00:39:00,960
And he started having panic attacks.
So he's had a contact person,

692
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,300
that dino video where it's like a
fresh pot. It's like his wife was like,

693
00:39:04,301 --> 00:39:05,520
are you all right?
And what happened?

694
00:39:05,521 --> 00:39:10,521
We know that it has an occupational
hazard when you work with top.

695
00:39:10,671 --> 00:39:13,150
Yeah. It's just, it's just how it works,
especially when you don't pay for it.

696
00:39:13,151 --> 00:39:16,350
Where we work and we have really strong
coffee. And then we started snakes.

697
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,000
And one of the things I do want to
say real quick is we always look for

698
00:39:19,001 --> 00:39:21,880
alternative methods.
And we just released a nitro cold brew,

699
00:39:21,881 --> 00:39:24,220
which is very concentrated
Deathwish coffee.

700
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:27,640
And Jeff would mean that home and
have a panic attack and not know why.

701
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,340
And it's because he would
have one of those too late
in the afternoon. Something.

702
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,950
Yeah.
How about you?

703
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:35,650
Um, I wake up very, very early,

704
00:39:35,651 --> 00:39:39,430
so I start with a chemics and I put a
little bit of almond milk in it and then I

705
00:39:39,431 --> 00:39:43,690
get to work and I make one the second I
get to work in a French press typically.

706
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:44,893
Yeah.

707
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:48,490
I feel like we haven't heard a
lot about the coffee itself. Yeah.

708
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:53,290
So I'm very curious about things like
sourcing, roasting, how you blend it,

709
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:55,760
where are you? Uh, and also
like, I guess most importantly,

710
00:39:55,761 --> 00:39:58,590
it gets very unusual to have a good,
like higher end coffee be me at,

711
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:02,350
I've ever Boosta. And what it's like,
you know, using Matt rather than Arabica,

712
00:40:02,351 --> 00:40:04,780
which every other single
copy I'm more of uses,

713
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:09,560
we'll use a rabbit goes well. Okay. Um,
I think our, I think Mike's Mike. Yeah.

714
00:40:09,561 --> 00:40:11,570
I mean,
our roasters is not here today.

715
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:14,130
That's probably why we haven't talked
about it, but he told you we'd have it.

716
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,650
It's in a, it's an Indian
Peruvian blend. Um,

717
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:21,610
so we get the reboost it means from India.
They're organic and fair trade.

718
00:40:21,611 --> 00:40:25,890
We're actually one of the few companies
out there that, that have, uh, an or,

719
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,850
or an organic source for reboost the
emotional boost. Do you find? Um,

720
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:33,140
it doesn't have the, uh, the
Usda organic certification on it,

721
00:40:33,141 --> 00:40:35,420
but we have a very good, uh, supplier.

722
00:40:35,421 --> 00:40:39,790
We work with importers and actually
in New York here and New Jersey, um,

723
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:44,330
and on the west coast, and they're
able to source that for us. Um,

724
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,130
the Peruvian is also organic fair trade.

725
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:50,150
Our coffee is a blended post rose,

726
00:40:50,151 --> 00:40:55,070
so we don't blend the beans and then
roast them. We roast them separately.

727
00:40:55,071 --> 00:40:56,600
So you'll see if you
actually opened a bag,

728
00:40:56,601 --> 00:41:00,080
you'll see two different shades in
there because we found that if you,

729
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:04,130
if you blended post roast, um, the flavor,

730
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,520
you'll get a more a fuller flavor.
Uh,

731
00:41:07,521 --> 00:41:10,250
we use Loring roasters.

732
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:15,290
It's almost like a giant popcorn
popper. I like to say, ah,

733
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,650
there's no direct flame on the beans ever.
So there's no scorching.

734
00:41:18,651 --> 00:41:22,970
If you crack or beans open, they're
roasted a uniformly straight through.

735
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:24,223
Um,

736
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:29,030
it's the most efficient roaster on the
market right now because it circulates

737
00:41:29,031 --> 00:41:29,780
the hot air.

738
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:34,430
So we don't waste a lot of gas and
there's an not a lot of exhaust either.

739
00:41:34,431 --> 00:41:36,170
It also make,

740
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:40,760
it also provides the benefit of us
not having to have an afterburner,

741
00:41:40,761 --> 00:41:44,450
which a lot of companies will have,

742
00:41:44,451 --> 00:41:47,150
which will reduce the
environmental impact.

743
00:41:47,151 --> 00:41:49,970
So it's the most environmental
friendly roaster. We have two of those.

744
00:41:49,971 --> 00:41:53,510
We have a 35 kilos in a
70 kilo, uh, at this time.

745
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:58,950
I want to speak a little bit on specialty
coffee and reboost a little bit.

746
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:03,780
Definitely when we first entered the
coffee industry reboost it was not

747
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:08,750
highly regarded. I wouldn't say
it's highly regarded, but um,

748
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:12,990
there are the NCAA, which is the
specialty Coffee Association of America.

749
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:18,620
They actually have set up something at
all of their events to compete with rebel

750
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,520
or booster. And, um,

751
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:24,000
that's something that I'm actually
really proud of at this point.

752
00:42:24,001 --> 00:42:26,010
It's cool you get to taste
for boost against each other.

753
00:42:26,011 --> 00:42:30,510
So even though it's not necessarily like
the third wave kind of light roast, um,

754
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:33,870
uh, choice, I, it definitely is.

755
00:42:33,871 --> 00:42:38,871
It's own beast that people do love and
enjoy and I think it's a 60% of coffee

756
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:42,440
enjoyed is a lot of the
times mixed with our booster

757
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:45,170
right now. Yeah. Be especially
because there's been a,

758
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:48,760
there's been a problem with coffee rust.
Um,

759
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,400
and because of this,
um,

760
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:57,430
the coffee industry is starting to
make hybrid plants with Arabica.

761
00:42:58,611 --> 00:43:02,150
Andrea boost it because there will
boost is much more, uh, hardy.

762
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:07,210
It can defend against this coffee rust
that they were initially thinking it was

763
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:10,040
going to,
we don't really raise coffee prices,

764
00:43:10,041 --> 00:43:15,041
but because they were able to
blend the two plants together,

765
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:17,990
um, it's resistant. So actually a lot of
coffee, you're probably getting all that.

766
00:43:17,991 --> 00:43:21,280
He thinks Arabica has some
has some are booster in it.

767
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:26,130
There's actually was studies that were
just done where a scientist just crack

768
00:43:26,131 --> 00:43:30,690
the genome on reboost a coffee and Arabica
has been out there for about a year

769
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:34,680
and so both genomes are now completely
mappable and that's why we're getting a

770
00:43:34,681 --> 00:43:35,700
lot of these hybrid plants,

771
00:43:35,701 --> 00:43:39,540
which is very interesting because now
we're going to be able to get a new type

772
00:43:39,541 --> 00:43:41,910
of being, you know,
that he has never even,

773
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:45,720
the world's never seen and the
possibilities of coffee are endless again.

774
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:47,180
So it's,
it's pretty exciting.

775
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:51,180
I think a lot of people just, you're here
like Oh, single origin Arabica beans.

776
00:43:51,181 --> 00:43:53,550
And you just hear that from different
people and you think like, oh yeah,

777
00:43:53,551 --> 00:43:55,530
that's the best one. Right? Like that's
what I thought. I was like, yeah,

778
00:43:55,531 --> 00:43:58,170
this is the best. I didn't know. You
just don't know until you try it.

779
00:43:58,171 --> 00:43:59,310
So I'll be able to just,

780
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:03,140
the blind taste tests are very funny and
especially, I mean, coming from me, I was,

781
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:07,580
I would criticize everyone's way of
brewing coffee and I was, you know,

782
00:44:07,581 --> 00:44:11,480
I was that person kind of until someone
stuck a blind taste test in front of me

783
00:44:11,481 --> 00:44:12,770
and then who was a jerk.

784
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:18,030
All personal preference,
personal preference. I tell
people that all the time.

785
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:20,790
We try to kind of, we're like
the gateway coffee drug. Um,

786
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,140
and I think having someone like Taya
and you know that that has really been

787
00:44:25,141 --> 00:44:28,230
around coffee for a long time,
people will buy it because it is,

788
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:31,990
it has a gimmicky approach, right?
It's a, it's colon, world's tronics

789
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:34,020
coffee. People were like,
screw that. That's stupid.

790
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:38,040
The third wave coffee people really
didn't respect that. Um, but the,

791
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:43,170
the modern person and, and most people
don't have that, uh, you know, pallet yet.

792
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:47,010
They don't know what good coffee is. So
we have this thing where it's, you know,

793
00:44:47,011 --> 00:44:50,460
Mike worked at a coffee shop. He was able
to test every kind of coffee he wanted,

794
00:44:50,461 --> 00:44:53,130
shrunk coffee, but he also
wanted it to taste good. Um,

795
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,200
and we charged a premium price
for it. It is a premium blend. Um,

796
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,140
and we always try to educate.

797
00:44:58,141 --> 00:45:01,800
And Alyssa is an amazing writer and
she writes a lot of blogs and take on.

798
00:45:01,801 --> 00:45:05,790
I started that where we educate our
customers who might be Dunkin donuts or

799
00:45:05,791 --> 00:45:10,090
Folgers or the Starbucks, whatever's
convenient and uh, and we show them the,

800
00:45:10,091 --> 00:45:12,660
you know, this is, this is good
coffee and here's how you can brew it.

801
00:45:12,661 --> 00:45:14,010
Here's Kevin Max,
here's French Press,

802
00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:16,410
here's alternative ways
to enjoy your coffee.

803
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:20,270
And now a lot of our fans that never, ever
would have gotten into that have like,

804
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:23,490
you see them like with a whole
station set up and there, you know,

805
00:45:23,491 --> 00:45:26,610
kettles and they're, and they're doing
that. So awesome question. But yeah,

806
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,800
we try to blend the two,
the two worlds.

807
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,420
Thank you. Thank you. Another question.

808
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,590
You alluded to it earlier when
you started selling online,

809
00:45:37,591 --> 00:45:39,870
all of a sudden there are a lot of
orders coming in coming in and you were

810
00:45:39,871 --> 00:45:40,704
falling behind.

811
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:44,190
I was just wondering if you go a little
bit further into how you scaled during

812
00:45:44,191 --> 00:45:47,700
that, that process in terms of like
vendors, sources and also staff.

813
00:45:47,701 --> 00:45:50,640
How quickly do that scale up and get
you back to where you need it to be?

814
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:56,110
Yeah, I was, I was very green
back then and I was using,

815
00:45:56,140 --> 00:46:00,190
I think shipstation and all I
was using paypal to, I'd have to,

816
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:03,820
I'd have to print out
every single order and

817
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:09,070
basically like I was thrown in the fire,
you know what I mean?

818
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:11,380
Throwing the fire when,
when good morning America happened,

819
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:16,710
where we had to produce thousands of
pounds of orders all at once and I didn't

820
00:46:19,331 --> 00:46:20,410
know how to do it.
And that was,

821
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:25,470
I was operating at a level where I
could probably do maybe 50 pounds a day

822
00:46:25,631 --> 00:46:29,950
comfortably. Um, so yeah.
How quickly did that happen?

823
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:34,240
Two months. Two months. Um, you know,

824
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:37,780
we started working with shipstation and
we were both printing owners after that,

825
00:46:37,781 --> 00:46:39,520
you know,
we bought another computer,

826
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:43,640
so it wasn't just one guy like
printing out the orders. I was,

827
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:49,420
Kane came on probably three weeks into it,
I think all the time.

828
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:52,260
They came along a little bit afterwards.
Um,

829
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:54,880
and there was five of us,

830
00:46:55,940 --> 00:47:00,290
five and at the time, um, when this
was 2013 just guys, just give you some,

831
00:47:00,291 --> 00:47:04,040
some references of time.
Uh, Mike had the idea, 2011,

832
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:08,030
2012 we started selling
2013 and march of 2013,

833
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:12,210
good morning America happened. Um,
and you know, as I said before,

834
00:47:12,211 --> 00:47:13,500
like none of us really had jobs.

835
00:47:13,501 --> 00:47:16,570
We didn't know if it was going
to be a sustainable company. Um,

836
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:20,430
and around June after we got through
that whole thing and we realized that the

837
00:47:20,431 --> 00:47:24,030
sales were still coming and maybe
we're onto something here, um,

838
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:28,200
we spent the next year making sure that
what had happened would never happen

839
00:47:28,201 --> 00:47:31,990
again. So we had flown up to the roof,
but we didn't have a foundation yet.

840
00:47:31,991 --> 00:47:33,520
So Mike was like,
okay,

841
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:37,990
let's outsource all this stuff that we
can't or don't want to do in house. Um,

842
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:41,350
and then let's start slowly after that,
started taking it back in.

843
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:45,190
So we immediately made lists
and on paper and like, okay,

844
00:47:45,191 --> 00:47:47,230
this is what we're doing now.
This is the process right now.

845
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:50,860
How do we either get rid of the process?
I have someone else do it or,

846
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:55,360
or how can we do it more efficiently?
Um, and so one of the things was, okay,

847
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:59,650
we can outsource to a distribution center.
So we went around and it, and Eric,

848
00:47:59,651 --> 00:48:00,720
who's not here,
um,

849
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:03,220
went around and just interview
distribution centers and
that was a huge thing.

850
00:48:03,221 --> 00:48:05,620
Now we don't have to actually
package coffee at that time.

851
00:48:05,621 --> 00:48:09,910
I spent anywhere between eight to 12
hours a day, packaging coffee. Um,

852
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,670
and then once we figured out how
to kind of make it sustainable,

853
00:48:12,671 --> 00:48:16,420
we started taking all that stuff back
and we're still taking stuff back, uh,

854
00:48:16,421 --> 00:48:19,090
to be able to do everything under
how, and you know, in house. But, uh,

855
00:48:19,091 --> 00:48:19,820
it was a process.

856
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:22,520
Scaling is probably one of the tougher
things that we've done. I mean,

857
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:24,560
Mike was doing our accounting for years.

858
00:48:24,561 --> 00:48:27,260
I'm pretty sure he still
has his hands in it. So I'm,

859
00:48:27,261 --> 00:48:30,930
and I'm the same way with
posting on Instagram like I
shouldn't be doing anymore,

860
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:34,720
but we're, we're all kind
of doing it. Um, hiring a,

861
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:38,570
we did use some temp services in the
beginning and we ended up keeping a few of

862
00:48:38,571 --> 00:48:43,160
those people on. Um, but yeah,
that scaling is impossible.
It's not like you can,

863
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:46,640
you know, look that up on the
Internet. We're so scaling,

864
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:51,390
same as being able to attract talent.
That's what I was most excited about.

865
00:48:51,391 --> 00:48:54,300
It took a long time cause at
first we would put like, you know,

866
00:48:54,301 --> 00:48:57,240
a Craig's list ad up and like, who, you
know, this person, we're looking for this,

867
00:48:57,241 --> 00:49:00,480
but we don't have money to
pay you. So like, here's a,
a small money. But it's like,

868
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,000
it might be bigger later. And, uh,

869
00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:06,450
I think the most exciting thing for
us right now is where, you know, we,

870
00:49:06,451 --> 00:49:10,200
we've done multimillions of
dollars of sales and, and
we're, we're still, you know,

871
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:12,650
growing and growing and
growing, um, being able to,

872
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:17,100
to bring on a Dustin who an absolute beast
and everything he does and, and like,

873
00:49:17,101 --> 00:49:20,190
okay, here's a problem, figure it out.
And he's like, so he builds our, you know,

874
00:49:20,191 --> 00:49:23,760
our entire warehouse and inventory. And
then Jeff, like, you know, so much about,

875
00:49:23,761 --> 00:49:27,270
you know, broadcasts and all
this, your voice, um, Alyssa,
you're a content, you know,

876
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:29,530
writer, can we, you know, where
you want to come over here?

877
00:49:29,531 --> 00:49:32,460
And went and worked for us and we met able
to do that and we're still doing that.

878
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:33,533
Super exciting.

879
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,760
Yeah.
It's like working for a small business.

880
00:49:35,761 --> 00:49:38,670
Like I'm somebody that went from working
in a corporation and then it was very

881
00:49:38,671 --> 00:49:39,600
attracted to this,
like,

882
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:42,210
what is this small business that
seems to be doing really well? Like,

883
00:49:42,211 --> 00:49:44,370
what's going on over here?
How can I get my hands into that?

884
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:47,520
And I think that as far
as scaling with people,

885
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:51,960
as people start to see that and as we
have jobs are to opening, people are like,

886
00:49:51,961 --> 00:49:52,231
wait,

887
00:49:52,231 --> 00:49:55,170
how can I get involved in something
that's cool and small and different than

888
00:49:55,171 --> 00:49:58,290
what like, you know, working at the state,
we're in upstate New York, so you know,

889
00:49:58,350 --> 00:49:59,183
that kind of thing.

890
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:02,870
I don't think we've even touched
on this like that at that point.

891
00:50:02,871 --> 00:50:04,730
Good Morning America. You
said that, you know, it was,

892
00:50:04,731 --> 00:50:08,990
it was a team of five and then that blew
up and obviously scaling up and like I

893
00:50:08,991 --> 00:50:10,130
said,
we're still scaling up.

894
00:50:10,131 --> 00:50:14,480
We have the largest employee
base right now and we're at 25,

895
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:17,870
2123 and that's the company.
So I mean, you know,

896
00:50:17,871 --> 00:50:22,160
and doing what we do,
it's still how do we,

897
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:26,300
how do we maintain that base but reach
that ceiling and not, you know, go,

898
00:50:26,301 --> 00:50:27,860
go nuts it.
So

899
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:30,320
it's a, it's a, it's a
journey. It really is.

900
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,860
I think the coolest thing also is
being able to do what, uh, what we,

901
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:36,800
what we're passionate about.
Matt when we were having lunch,

902
00:50:36,801 --> 00:50:40,160
he alluded to like the 20% time and
people being able to have time to do

903
00:50:40,161 --> 00:50:42,770
projects they're passionate
about. And, and we, you know,

904
00:50:42,771 --> 00:50:45,770
we're obviously on a much smaller scale,
but we have a lot of things that we,

905
00:50:45,771 --> 00:50:48,860
like for instance, Alissa, you might want
to talk about the grinded out campaign,

906
00:50:48,861 --> 00:50:51,560
our first real marketing campaign
where they had these ideas.

907
00:50:51,561 --> 00:50:52,394
I'll let you talk a little more.

908
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:55,730
Yeah. So basically what we would like,
we were talking about our fan base.

909
00:50:55,731 --> 00:51:00,440
We have a lot of nurses and firefighters
and things like that that really use

910
00:51:00,441 --> 00:51:01,850
the coffee to get them through the day.

911
00:51:01,851 --> 00:51:05,780
So what we decided to do with kind of
put together a content campaign where we

912
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:09,290
highlighted those people
because we felt like, you know,

913
00:51:09,291 --> 00:51:13,200
so many companies are like Highland men
who athlete or like highlighting this

914
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:14,150
super famous person.

915
00:51:14,151 --> 00:51:17,990
But like who we want to champion is the
people that are drinking our coffee.

916
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:22,580
And that might be the nurse that's in
the hospital or the EMT or all of those

917
00:51:22,581 --> 00:51:26,990
people. So yeah. So basically it
was something where, you know,

918
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:29,870
the marketing team, me Taya and our
art director Thomas were like, yeah,

919
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:33,410
wouldn't it be really cool to put together
some videos of these people and blogs

920
00:51:33,411 --> 00:51:36,860
and play lists and all of this kind
of stuff. And Mike was like, do it.

921
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:41,930
So it's kind of been able to give us the
freedom to just make creative projects

922
00:51:41,931 --> 00:51:42,764
and things like that.

923
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:43,840
We want to just show up.

924
00:51:43,841 --> 00:51:47,790
We wanted to showcase the greatest tag
line like that you guys came up with is,

925
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,620
is we wanted to showcase how our
coffee lives. Yeah. You know,

926
00:51:50,621 --> 00:51:55,090
and it's not just about whose hands
we can flip coffee into. It's about,

927
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:56,260
like we said,
you know,

928
00:51:56,261 --> 00:51:58,990
it's like you get up every morning and
you might have a cup of coffee and then

929
00:51:58,991 --> 00:52:03,010
you're going to go do something awesome.
Usually, you know, and it's like, okay,

930
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,360
let's see you do that
awesome thing and why,

931
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:06,970
how is it and why are you doing that?

932
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,480
And that's kind of where that
whole marketing came to cry it out.

933
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:14,440
Hashtag Hashtag Rhino everyone
can boy after. Yeah. Yeah.

934
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:18,080
Like, it's, we want to see everybody's
grind because like you said, it's,

935
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:20,360
it's how our coffee live.
So cool.

936
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:23,440
Thank you. It really is, um, uh,

937
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:28,450
powerful and amazing story of the passion
for a product leading to the creation

938
00:52:29,001 --> 00:52:33,290
of a family, uh, leading to the
creation of a community. Uh,

939
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:38,350
and it's interesting that the product
itself is sort of secondary to all of that

940
00:52:38,361 --> 00:52:41,660
for you guys. That really it's about
you being able to work together,

941
00:52:41,661 --> 00:52:45,200
follow your passions, and continue
to grow this community out there. Um,

942
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:49,320
to that respect, please let people know
how they can find all of this. I where,

943
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:52,310
where do you go to hear the podcast?
How, where can you check out the coffee?

944
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:56,480
Go to death wish coffee.com. That's
the easiest place. That's the arc.

945
00:52:56,540 --> 00:53:00,620
Our content hub for everything. I mean,
you can find us on Twitter, Instagram,

946
00:53:00,621 --> 00:53:04,250
and Facebook. Obviously I'm
under death wish coffee. Um,

947
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:09,160
the podcast lives right off our homepage
to go Deathwish coffee.com backslash

948
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:13,610
outcast, outcast. Uh, what were
the top selling coffee on Amazon?

949
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:15,650
So if you go over there
and type in coffee,

950
00:53:15,651 --> 00:53:19,310
we should be under the
headline bestseller.

951
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:25,450
You can buy it there or you can also
get on jet and get it on our website.

952
00:53:25,801 --> 00:53:26,220
We actually

953
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:30,510
have a, um, we're going to be in
your guys' employee discounts,

954
00:53:30,511 --> 00:53:33,020
I think in the next quarter.
I worked a deal out with a,

955
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:37,140
I forgot who was the head of that, but
if you do use a discount, Google, um,

956
00:53:37,141 --> 00:53:41,720
you will get 20% off the back of our car
or whatever it was on the website. Um,

957
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,310
so you can share that internally.
It hasn't been announced yet,

958
00:53:44,311 --> 00:53:48,000
but that should be coming. Um,
very soon. It's been announced. No,

959
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:52,400
you'll be able to find it and just
says that he said he was gonna share it

960
00:53:52,401 --> 00:53:54,200
around the office. I wasn't
a big deal. He just hasn't,

961
00:53:54,201 --> 00:53:56,480
it hasn't been in the newsletter yet,
so I don't think I broke any rules.

962
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:02,510
We'll see.
Also get off that newsletter and just a,

963
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:08,180
the podcast location, any Podbean, iTunes,

964
00:54:10,970 --> 00:54:14,400

yeah, you can pretty much find us anyway.

965
00:54:14,401 --> 00:54:16,830
And like I said, we're getting into
video too, so, you know, youtube, we're,

966
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:20,340
we're all over that Facebook
live. Excellent. Well,
