1
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,590
Good afternoon everyone.
Thank you for being present.

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,270
Happy Women's Day to all the ladies in
the audience and it is a pleasure and an

3
00:00:13,271 --> 00:00:14,500
honor being here at Google.

4
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:20,850
It was always on the 25th of
December that my late father,

5
00:00:21,301 --> 00:00:26,301
Orlando used to recite the exact same
story year in and year out to my elder

6
00:00:28,691 --> 00:00:33,340
brother, Giovanni and myself. It
wasn't one of his own stories.

7
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,830
It didn't stem from his own experiences,

8
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:41,220
but it was a story that was relayed to
him by a former mentor of his doctor

9
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:46,900
Rossi. When my father used to work
at the Cypress Embassy in London.

10
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:52,950
The story was about a former under
secretary of defense and that former under

11
00:00:53,501 --> 00:00:58,501
secretary of defense was invited for
the second year running at the same

12
00:00:58,781 --> 00:01:03,400
conference
as he took up the podium.

13
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:09,280
He was holding a Styrofoam Cup with
coffin in his hand and before he started

14
00:01:09,281 --> 00:01:13,990
speaking he went off
script, took a sip, smiled,

15
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,330
turned,
looked at the audience and said,

16
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,180
I want to talk to you
about the Styrofoam Cup.

17
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:23,950
Last year I was the
undersecretary of defense.

18
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,100
I flew here,
business class,

19
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,380
a limousine was waiting for me at
the airport to drive me to my hotel.

20
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:38,100
They already checked me in the next day
there was another limousine waiting to

21
00:01:39,161 --> 00:01:40,360
bring me to this venue.

22
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:45,580
They escorted me to the green room and
the green room is the room where all

23
00:01:45,581 --> 00:01:50,581
speakers meet and prepare before they
take the stage and when I asked for

24
00:01:50,591 --> 00:01:51,610
something to drink,

25
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,200
they brought me coffee in a ceramic cup.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,140
This year I'm no longer the
under secretary of defense.

27
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,350
I came,
I flew economy class.

28
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,240
I took a taxi from the airport
all the way to my hotel.

29
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,510
I checked myself in
and it took 15 minutes.

30
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,920
The next day I took another taxi to come
to this venue and because I couldn't

31
00:02:22,651 --> 00:02:24,180
remember where the green room was,

32
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:30,470
I asked them to escort me and they
gave me or directions how to get there.

33
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,960
Then I asked for something to drink and
they showed me the vending machine and

34
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:41,070
they said, take a surf on cup and
serve yourself. Whatever you like.

35
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,810
He turns,
looks at the audience and says,

36
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,290
we all deserve a Styrofoam Cup.

37
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,040
The Ceramic Cup was never meant for us.

38
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,540
It was meant for the position
that I was holding at the time.

39
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,790
So as you gained fame,

40
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:06,100
as you gain fortunate
positions or possessions,

41
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,260
people will open up doors for you.

42
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,580
They wouldn't refer to
you as Sir and Madam.

43
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,560
They would bring gifts and when
you ask for something to drink,

44
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,450
they will bring your coffee
or your tea in a ceramic cup.

45
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,230
But because time doesn't stand still,

46
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,550
we all deserve a Styrofoam Cup

47
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:38,070
and I'm being former under secretary of
defense found out the hard way we sh two

48
00:03:40,601 --> 00:03:45,601
should be alerted to the fact and to
the possibility that we might not be our

49
00:03:47,111 --> 00:03:49,840
current position or our positions.

50
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,820
Who we really are.
As today's title suggests,

51
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,520
which is finding your inner campus,

52
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,400
is that internal camp has,

53
00:04:00,401 --> 00:04:05,401
when you strip away positions or
positions that will guide you through

54
00:04:06,431 --> 00:04:11,260
challenging and difficult
moments in business and in life.

55
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,500
Today,
my dear friends,

56
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:20,310
I will relay five personal stories and
each story carries a valuable lesson.

57
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,800
That's the lessons that power my internal
campus and helped me navigate through

58
00:04:28,991 --> 00:04:33,250
the professional and the personal world.
I hope,

59
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,260
but by the end of the speech,

60
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:41,550
the same stories and the
underlying messages from
these stories will help power

61
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,660
your internal campus and help
you navigate better in your life.

62
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,960
So they make the road more smooth in
order to reach for that elusive word,

63
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:57,610
which is called success.
Three disclaimers to make.

64
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:03,690
Each and every lesson starts with a
letter h as you will see from each story.

65
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,860
Second disclaimer,
there are no powerpoints.

66
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,910
Unlike 95% of my keynote speaking,

67
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:17,940
there are no powerpoints because I do
not believe that there slide can depict

68
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:23,390
interlock campuses and values as well
as a vivid story which carries an

69
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:28,420
underlying message. And
disclaimer, number three,

70
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,140
the law.
The third story,

71
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:39,380
which happened 13 years ago in 2006
I've never ever before set this story in

72
00:05:41,221 --> 00:05:44,300
front of a professional audience.
I only one message,

73
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:49,340
I only once mentioned this story
and that was on the 9th of October,

74
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:55,590
2018 as I was lecturing at University
College London in front of 300 students.

75
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:01,340
So let's begin and let me take you
back to 1997 that was the year that I

76
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:05,180
completed my studies
in the United Kingdom.

77
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:10,660
I've done my Ba and my master's degree
and like any good Cypriot boy who has a

78
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,580
flourishing business,
I went back to the island,

79
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,890
back to Cypress to work
for the family business,

80
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,570
all newcomers at our family business,

81
00:06:20,571 --> 00:06:22,550
which was called variety
is still called variety.

82
00:06:22,551 --> 00:06:26,780
We deal with catering equipment and
tabletop supplies for the Horeca industry.

83
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:30,170
The Horeca industry is hotels,
restaurants and catering.

84
00:06:30,171 --> 00:06:35,171
Institutions had to go through an
induction course and that induction course

85
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,910
started from my late father's office

86
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,650
and I too had to go
through the same procedure.

87
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:48,050
That was what I called my phd degree only.

88
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,500
It didn't last five years.
It lasted five minutes.

89
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:57,730
My father gave me two valuable pieces
of advice for the first piece of advice.

90
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:05,350
My father took a pencil and he
took a sharpener and he said,

91
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,633
Michael,

92
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,333
yeah,

93
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,500
I've sharpened your edge.
I paid.

94
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:19,890
You are lucky enough and
I paid for your tuition,

95
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,750
but if you leave a pencil
standing on its own,

96
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:26,730
it will fall.

97
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:32,820
Go out their son and find the
hunt that will keep you standing.

98
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,180
The handed we'll keep you standing was
an analogy for the mentors in my life,

99
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,730
for the trusted advisors,

100
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,960
the likes of your former colleague McCally
Solo Montez who was escorting me here,

101
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:51,720
all the mistakes that I've done in my
life and all the failures that they've

102
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:55,470
encountered. Because as the
saying goes, when you lose,

103
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,000
don't lose the lesson

104
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:05,600
and I owe a very big thank you to all
the people who turned me down and all

105
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,820
those who believed in me to hire me.

106
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,150
And as I was making my way
out of my father's office,

107
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,650
he gave me the second piece
of advice. He said, son,

108
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,590
I see something in you.

109
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:24,640
My feeling is you will do well in
life 10 15 years down the road.

110
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:29,900
And when you do well,
when you gain positions and possessions,

111
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:34,490
if for any reason you think
that there is one person,

112
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:40,040
then you don't need them because you
either outgrown them or get in a better

113
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:42,410
position.
That's the day.

114
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:47,000
And I as an experienced professional,
young professional,

115
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:50,690
I rush to fill in the sentence and I said,
that's the day that I made it,

116
00:08:50,691 --> 00:08:54,980
that he said, no, that's the
day that you lost it all sir.

117
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:59,130
So the first stage in our first story,

118
00:08:59,131 --> 00:09:02,010
my dear friends is age for being humble.

119
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,440
Understanding that as you rise up the
hierarchy ladder as you taste success,

120
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,330
always remain humble

121
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:20,780
because we are not our current successes.
We are not our trophies,

122
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:24,290
we are not our positions or our positions.

123
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:31,090
Which leads me to the second story that
happened in 1998 I was one year into the

124
00:09:32,061 --> 00:09:35,720
family business
and Lo and behold,

125
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:38,660
the company that my dad
told me to take care of,

126
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,820
which was Carlisle food service products.

127
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:45,290
It's the tumblers where you have your
juice here at Google of like food service

128
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:48,350
products.
We want the first European award.

129
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:54,140
So the Americans taller to fly all the
way to shallow together with my brother,

130
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:57,620
all expenses paid to get an award.

131
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:03,310
And we were lucky because there were
seven days of celebrations and on the last

132
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,630
day,
Jeffrey Gitomer,

133
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:09,320
one of the best sales
consultants in the United States,

134
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:13,940
came to speak to us for
all those who know me.

135
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,520
I cannot stand still for 10 minutes.

136
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:22,070
I stayed live at that on my
chair for six consecutive hours.

137
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:27,950
As soon as Jeffrey Gitomer finished
his talk, I ran up to him and I said,

138
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:32,840
Mr Gitomer, congratulations.
How can I become like user?

139
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:38,330
And he turned, he looked at me and
said, it's easy and it's difficult.

140
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,000
And as I say, period, I said, what's easy

141
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,950
is that study on your chosen topic,
whichever topic of that is

142
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:56,320
for two hours every day except weekends.
In five years,

143
00:10:56,321 --> 00:11:00,640
you'll be recognized in your
country in 10 years worldwide.

144
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:06,340
I said, sir, I'll start
today. I bought his books.

145
00:11:06,341 --> 00:11:07,750
At the time he had only two books.

146
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:12,640
The Sales Bible and customer
satisfaction is worthless.

147
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,670
Customer loyalty is priceless.

148
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:21,040
I even bought his cassettes,
not DVDs, not cds,

149
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,830
not USBS,
but cassettes.

150
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:29,290
And I was listening to Jeffrey
Gitomer's cassettes in my car,

151
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,500
which was sales messages coming out,

152
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,680
driving from one town
of Cyprus to the next,

153
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:39,580
promoting Caroline food service products
and all the other products that we had

154
00:11:39,581 --> 00:11:43,750
that variety, and I was weeping in
my car, listening to the messages,

155
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,530
and I have a feeling that people looking
from the outside thought that I was

156
00:11:47,531 --> 00:11:48,550
going to a funeral.

157
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:54,610
I still remember my favorite tape,
my favorite cassette.

158
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:58,720
It was one or 1.5 rules for success.

159
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,600
Let me tell you my
favorite rule for success.

160
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:06,900
It was the one oh 1.5 you're given a
bucket of water in a bucket of cement.

161
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:13,740
You can either build a stepping stone
towards success or a stumbling block.

162
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,190
The choice is yours,

163
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,660
and he was right.
Even the great author,

164
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,140
Malcolm Gladwell in his book outliers,

165
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,820
he said the exact same thing.
He popularized the notion that wasn't his,

166
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,250
but it was the 10,000 hours.

167
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:38,300
Malcolm Gladwell said that if
you want to achieve something,

168
00:12:38,301 --> 00:12:40,580
you need to put those 10,000 hours in.

169
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:46,180
Even the Beatles were known for seven
consecutive years as they played music in

170
00:12:48,561 --> 00:12:52,970
what was eastern Germany at the time
and it was after they hit that mark,

171
00:12:52,971 --> 00:12:56,480
the 10,000 hour mark that people
started to recognize them.

172
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:00,680
Even great criminals,
as it says in the book,

173
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:04,670
need 10,000 hours to perfect their craft.

174
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:09,480
So my dear friends,

175
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:16,430
the second age is age for hard work.

176
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,620
I know you work at a technology company
and I know that intelligent work is also

177
00:13:22,621 --> 00:13:23,454
important,

178
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:28,110
but hard work takes precedence
over intelligence work.

179
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:33,870
I guess what I'm saying to you is
sacrificed something today so you can gain

180
00:13:33,871 --> 00:13:35,490
something better tomorrow,

181
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,440
which leads us to the third story,

182
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:44,570
which I've never before said in front of
a professional audience so you can cut

183
00:13:44,571 --> 00:13:45,770
the camera now.
I'm joking.

184
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
2006 as a good Cypriot boy who was working
at the family business getting a bit

185
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,460
older.
By the way,

186
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:59,480
I am 46 even though I look
45 just for your information,

187
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,900
it was time to get married.

188
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:08,090
700,000 inhabitants on
the island of Cyprus.

189
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:11,210
We invited 4,000 to the wedding.

190
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,000
That was almost 1%

191
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:20,890
and the night before the wedding I found
out that my wife was cheating on me.

192
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:27,020
Yes, I know you say such a good
looking guy and she's cheating on him.

193
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:30,110
Can you believe that?
I had the same feeling.

194
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:38,870
So what did I do? I had to think for a
while and then I called everything off.

195
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,690
My mother was crying.
My late grandmother was hysterical.

196
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,800
What will happen to their family name?
What will happen to our image?

197
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:51,950
What will happen to your image? What
would happen my life? I told them

198
00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:00,580
the only person who hasn't spoken like
always and waited and waited was my dad.

199
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,010
So he comes up to me, he says,
Michael, let's go to the front veranda.

200
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:12,530
The Front Veranda in my parents' home
was where the bad news were delivered.

201
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:17,390
The back veranda was where
the good news were delivered.

202
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,270
So I go to the front veranda.

203
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,490
He puts his hand on my
shoulders and he says, son,

204
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:30,890
you have guts.
Actually the word he was wasn't guts,

205
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,710
but for this speech at Google,
it's guts.

206
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:41,240
When I die,
he continued on.

207
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:46,640
I'm very happy and I will die peacefully
knowing that I can leave the company to

208
00:15:46,641 --> 00:15:47,900
your brother,
Giovanni,

209
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:53,200
who has the wisdom and the patients
and also to you son who has guts.

210
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,900
So my dear friends,
the third age

211
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:03,440
is age for honesty and I'm not talking
about honesty from the other person

212
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,120
because you cannot control that.

213
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:09,530
It's being honest with yourself
to take the hard decisions.

214
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:14,240
Even if he'd paints you at the time
that you are taking those decisions

215
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,100
and we move on to the fourth story.

216
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:25,320
One year after not
proceeding with a wedding,

217
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:30,350
2007 now I had to find the guts to go
tell my dad that I wanted to leave the

218
00:16:30,841 --> 00:16:35,490
company and pursue what you see
me now doing, giving keynotes,

219
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:40,830
training, development and
consulting. I go up to my dad.

220
00:16:40,831 --> 00:16:44,370
I explained what I wanted to do. He
says, son, let's go to the front veranda.

221
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:51,210
We go to the front veranda. He
said, Michael, you can go your way.

222
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:56,400
I'm sure you will succeed, but if
you leave the, they will close down.

223
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,720
He bought himself 1,100 days.

224
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:06,050
I stayed at the family
business for another three
years and when the time passed

225
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,680
I went back. My father was a
true gentleman. He said, son,

226
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:18,540
you will do very well, but I would like
to give you some advice, go your own way,

227
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:23,130
but I would like to give you some advice.
This is where the fourth age comes in.

228
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:26,550
Always be helpful,

229
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:32,750
deliver value first or deliver value
without expecting anything in return.

230
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:37,200
And he gave me two pieces of
advice that I will never forget.

231
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:43,100
The first piece of advice was that when
you meet prospects and they ask you to

232
00:17:44,011 --> 00:17:48,480
give quotations,
never merely right accommodation,

233
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:51,030
right self help book,

234
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:55,140
give them so much value that
they can see their vision,

235
00:17:55,350 --> 00:18:00,300
give them so much material and
value so they can bring it to life.

236
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,420
If they decide to come with you,
your price will see minute.

237
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,620
If they opt to go with your competitors,

238
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:12,450
at least you have built a stepping
stone towards their success.

239
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:20,960
And my father was right and I still do it.
Up until today.

240
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:26,150
Even recently when a company from New
York contacted me to do a cultural

241
00:18:26,151 --> 00:18:27,290
enhancement project,

242
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:32,450
which involves strengthening the team
and it had a 360 degree evaluation,

243
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,760
which means that those managers were
evaluated by the top management,

244
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:41,600
by their peers, by their
subordinates, and by customers.

245
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:44,060
I didn't just write a quotation,

246
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:49,420
I even sent a five page
pdf with all the questions,

247
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:54,350
everything that I was intending to ask.
And if I don't get the job,

248
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,670
I still know that I added
value to that company.

249
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:03,710
And if I do get the job,
they can come back and alter
some questions, change some.

250
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,240
And even giving me some feedback.

251
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:12,190
What my father was telling me is be
a trusted advisor, not a salesperson.

252
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,170
Yeah.

253
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:19,170
And I guess what I'm telling
you is transform your
thinking from what can I get

254
00:19:19,331 --> 00:19:21,580
from you too.
How can I serve you?

255
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:28,420
And the second piece of advice he
gave me that day was that Michael,

256
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:32,920
you will never be the
smartest person in the room.

257
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:37,390
And he and my dad had foresight.
Even though he died in 19 months ago,

258
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,280
he never knew I was coming to Google.

259
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:43,570
So this guy had foresight and it's true,
my dear friends,

260
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:48,220
even if you are wanting a million
in a 7 billion population,

261
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:52,000
there are another 7,000
people exactly like you.

262
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:57,430
Why should they hire you?
Recently I was at singularity university.

263
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,390
I took a course there and
they have the same philosophy.

264
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:06,640
They were telling us that engineers,

265
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,950
the brightest minds,
scientists,

266
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:13,980
we're trying to fault protein three
dimensionally and they were trying for 15

267
00:20:14,261 --> 00:20:16,690
years nonstop and they never managed it.

268
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,570
They all pent up,

269
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:25,500
they open sourced it and in 10 days only
a wife from the Midwest folded protein.

270
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,170
So the experts are the known experts,

271
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,350
the experts sometimes or
outside your organization.

272
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:40,270
And it is not a coincidence that
in the book of how Google Works,

273
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:45,600
it says on page 175 default to open.

274
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:52,480
So have you kind of not be the
smartest person in the room.

275
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:55,810
You can be something else.
In my case,

276
00:20:56,170 --> 00:21:01,120
I opted to be the prom test and I have
a rule. If you go onto my website,

277
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:06,150
you will see that I reply back to my
messages with the rule seven seven seven I

278
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:10,420
reply back in seven seconds.
If I'm not doing anything,

279
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,080
I reply immediately in seven minutes.
If I'm doing something,

280
00:21:14,081 --> 00:21:17,740
I want to finish it and then
reply or in seven hours,

281
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,600
which is the duration of a workshop,

282
00:21:19,601 --> 00:21:21,580
I finished the workshop
and then I reply back.

283
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,780
I'm not telling you to do
that within this framework,

284
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:30,790
but expanded if you like
to 14 1414 or 21 seconds,

285
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,680
21 minutes or 10 to one hours,

286
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:38,610
but refrain from staying
at the 24 hour rule,

287
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,830
which was invented when
there were telephones,

288
00:21:41,831 --> 00:21:44,080
plaque on the wall and not smart devices.

289
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:49,240
And when they were at that time,
people were more backward.

290
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:54,430
So my dear friends,
the fourth age is to be helpful,

291
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,860
which leads us to the fifth and final age.

292
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,450
And for this story,

293
00:22:01,451 --> 00:22:06,451
I need to take you to nine 11 2011 that
was the day that I married the woman.

294
00:22:08,681 --> 00:22:09,514
Of My dreams.

295
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:14,790
The lady that puts a smile on a daily
face on a daily per day on my parallel in

296
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:20,410
my face. And that's Christine.
And on the 28th of January,

297
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:25,830
2013 she delivered the greatest present
in our lives and that's our six year old

298
00:22:26,681 --> 00:22:31,681
Rolando who wanted to accompany me on
this trip to meet the people behind his

299
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:32,830
favorite platform.

300
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:38,560
And that is youtube because thanks to you,

301
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,720
he observes, he meticulously
observes Christiana, Ronaldo,

302
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:46,480
soccer Mousse on a daily,
sorry, hourly basis.

303
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,560
So when we're going to get
married with Christine,

304
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:54,220
Christine went to your grandfather
who passed away recently,

305
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:59,430
who was married to his childhood
sweetheart for 68 years.

306
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:05,860
And she asked for advice
for a happy marriage and her
grandfather was very happy

307
00:23:05,861 --> 00:23:07,030
to give that advice.
I don't know,

308
00:23:07,031 --> 00:23:09,640
maybe he was worried that I would
walk away from this wedding as well.

309
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,150
And he said to her,
Christine,

310
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:17,710
do you know what's the secret to
a happy and a longterm wedding?

311
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:22,780
And Christine said, what's the
secret grandfather? He said,

312
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:28,680
give 100% to your spouse
and expect zero in return.

313
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:34,650
If your husband to be gives
100% and expect zero in return,

314
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:39,330
then you increase your chances
of having a happy wedding.

315
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:44,320
Think about it, my friends. It also
applies to all the other agents.

316
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:49,910
Give 100% of your marriage or to your
relationships and expect zero in return.

317
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:53,600
Give 100% to hard work
and intelligence work.

318
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:59,330
Be 100% honest first and
foremost with yourselves.

319
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,210
Even if he'd paints you at the
time you take the decision,

320
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:06,680
take it if you are wrong at
the immediate and apologize,

321
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:12,830
be 100% helpful by offering
value to others first

322
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,760
and be 100% humble.

323
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,840
Not because you will need someone
further down the line in your career,

324
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,680
but because it is the right thing to do.

325
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,310
So if you're wondering by now,
what's the fifth h,

326
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:33,050
the fifth h is h for heart.

327
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:39,020
Opening your heart and pour your heart
in everything and anything that you do

328
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:44,090
because it's only in this way that
you can move away from positions and

329
00:24:44,091 --> 00:24:47,450
possessions and you move
closer to your true north.

330
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:49,790
And by true north,

331
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:55,120
I mean that internal compass that is
helping you to navigate through life after

332
00:24:56,751 --> 00:24:57,680
all my dear friends.

333
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:03,430
It is that campus that represents who
you are as human beings at your deepest

334
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:06,860
level.
Thank you very much.

335
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:12,300
[inaudible]

336
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,730
thank you very much for
being here today with us.

337
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:27,350
Punish and I live at Toka doctors my
heart and I think you represented few of

338
00:25:27,351 --> 00:25:32,120
the values we have in the company.
Like put the user first, be Humvee,

339
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:35,900
take risks. So, um, it's nice
remembering again and again.

340
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:39,870
I have few questions, uh, one then

341
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,430
my first question is about mentors.

342
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:49,100
Do you want to tell us who were your
few of your mentors along the way?

343
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,360
And My, my question is how
do you find the minders?

344
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:56,960
Is it something that comes into
your life or you seek for them?

345
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,590
Okay, excellent question. Uh,

346
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,860
how many mentors and
mentors do not have age?

347
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:06,530
If I'm going to be giving
a speech on technology, uh,

348
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,840
I rush to find younger people,
older people. It depends.

349
00:26:10,841 --> 00:26:14,500
The people who are well versed.
My father was my first ever mentor.

350
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:19,210
I had mentors from my university days,
my college professors.

351
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,230
I even meet people on the road,
which I keep in touch always.

352
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:28,840
But you cannot find a mentor if you're
not ready to receive a mentor in your

353
00:26:28,841 --> 00:26:32,620
life and to receive advice.
And uh,

354
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,570
I hope I have answered
your question this way.

355
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:39,920
Definitely. And can I ask,
it seems like the father,

356
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:44,760
the model in your life I eat
really played important role in Eh,

357
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:49,350
have you kept, I don't know, he's wisdom
in one sentence maybe or you know,

358
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,690
something you want to
share with us about this?

359
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,110
It seems like a very
pretty sure relationship.

360
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:56,310
It was a very precious relationship.

361
00:26:56,910 --> 00:27:01,910
My father died on the 22nd of August,

362
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:06,300
2017 and the time at that,
the time that he died,

363
00:27:06,301 --> 00:27:08,910
he was wearing kiss variety tee shirt,

364
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:12,360
which said customer service first.

365
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,960
So my father always believed that you
should serve your customer and that

366
00:27:18,091 --> 00:27:22,050
customer is also the internal customer
and the way you treat your internal

367
00:27:22,051 --> 00:27:25,740
customers is the way that your internal
customers will serve your external

368
00:27:25,741 --> 00:27:27,930
customers.
So at the end of the day,

369
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,630
my father wasn't focused on
the price of the products.

370
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,440
He wasn't focused so much on the quality,
even though he believed in quality.

371
00:27:34,441 --> 00:27:36,330
That's why we imported
a lot of German things,

372
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:42,020
but he believed in people and he believed
in helping people give first and then

373
00:27:42,181 --> 00:27:43,020
you will receive.

374
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:48,000
So awesome for my side. Thank you very
much for this inspiring speech. Um,

375
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:50,010
in your second story,

376
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:54,570
you were talking about the advice you
got to follow to practice two hours of a

377
00:27:54,571 --> 00:27:59,220
certain topic to become very good at
it. And you immediately said, okay,

378
00:27:59,221 --> 00:28:01,110
I want to,
I'm going to start today.

379
00:28:01,111 --> 00:28:05,610
I know exactly what this
topic is now in my situation.

380
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,950
I'm 30 years old now, 29 actually like me,

381
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:15,600
46 45 exactly. Um, I don't know yet,

382
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,920
which is the precise topic
that I want to focus on.

383
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,630
That drives me for the next 15 years.

384
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:26,690
And I also believe that this is
kind of an generational thing.

385
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:33,170
So what advice would you give to us
to find this topic where you have your

386
00:28:33,901 --> 00:28:38,901
passion and the topic that that follows
you and the drives that basically drives

387
00:28:40,321 --> 00:28:42,660
to the next 10 to 15 years?

388
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,690
I was 20 and that's a great question.
By the way,

389
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:49,200
I was 29 years old when
I found my passion.

390
00:28:49,201 --> 00:28:52,380
When I saw Jeffrey Gitomer on stage,
I was mesmerized.

391
00:28:52,381 --> 00:28:56,040
I went up to him and I asked him before
that I was working for the family

392
00:28:56,041 --> 00:28:58,830
business and even though I
was enjoying it very much,

393
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:02,910
I felt it like you're filling it now.
I might be this or something else.

394
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:07,260
What I will say to you is whatever
you're doing now, give it your best.

395
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:11,580
As Muhammad Ali once said, if you're
shipping, if you're sweeping the floors,

396
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:13,740
sweep it to the best of your abilities.

397
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:17,100
Give it your best because
somebody is watching.

398
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:21,600
My late father always told me to
keep a note for everyone I meet.

399
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:23,580
What did I like?
What I didn't like,

400
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,920
because even I'm not
saying about your manager,

401
00:29:25,921 --> 00:29:29,520
but even if your manager
doesn't appreciate what you
do, which is not the case,

402
00:29:29,521 --> 00:29:34,200
but I'm just saying it.
So why are you laughing guys?

403
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:40,410
Somebody else is watching and whilst
you're doing what you're doing to the best

404
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:44,590
of your abilities, an
opportunity, we'll knock the door.

405
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:50,110
So be concerned. Shoes, do what you
do. Continue being knowledgeable,

406
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,690
put in those hours in
what you're doing now.

407
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:57,340
But you have to be honest with yourself.
If this doesn't inspire you,

408
00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:00,640
you need to take the painful
decision and do something else.

409
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:03,040
And I'm not only talking
about relationships,

410
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:04,960
I wanted to ask,

411
00:30:04,961 --> 00:30:09,940
you mentioned that you had kind of
understood three years before you left the

412
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:12,970
company,
that you wanted to change career paths.

413
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:18,300
So how did you find the courage to
actually leave after three years and just,

414
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,310
um,
go off and do your own thing?

415
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:24,730
If, if that's scared, it means
that I had the courage. Yes.

416
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:30,090
Then I believed I was preparing myself
for 10 years to find the courage to go

417
00:30:31,691 --> 00:30:36,190
and do what I'm doing. And from the
day that I decided to go on my own,

418
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:40,380
I had to believe in myself. First
and foremost. I took my, uh,

419
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:44,830
my father's advice on board
and I was adamant, even though,

420
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:49,750
and I will tell you when I went for my
first Gig and they asked me, Michael,

421
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,260
how much do you charge
for a speech at that time?

422
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:57,580
At that time it was 1,500 Cypress pounds.

423
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,830
And the guy said,
excuse me,

424
00:30:59,831 --> 00:31:04,330
1,500 pounds for a one hour speech.

425
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:09,220
Do you know how much your competitors
are charging? And he told me two names,

426
00:31:09,221 --> 00:31:14,050
which had 30 years of experience
and they were charging 500 lbs.

427
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:19,410
Why should I pay you 1,500 pounds
and you don't even have experience?

428
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:24,430
And I said, sir, I was preparing for
10 years and if you don't like it,

429
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:28,120
I will give you your money back.
And he threw me out of the office,

430
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,560
but the next year somebody
else believed in me.

431
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:41,190
I kept the 1,500 ceiling
and they gave me a chance.

432
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,030
It went on to youtube.

433
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:48,010
We just don't think you know which
company by Google and thanks to Google,

434
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:53,290
I commanded my pricing and thanks to
their performance on stage because my

435
00:31:53,291 --> 00:31:55,810
father told me,
if you're going on your own son,

436
00:31:56,770 --> 00:32:00,370
don't put your prices low. Because
if you are very good at what you do,

437
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:04,090
it will never go up high. It all,
it will take 10 years to go up here.

438
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:08,440
Put your prices high,
deliver more value than expected.

439
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:13,030
You'll get a lot of rejections,
but you'll get a chance eventually.

440
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,940
Any of you are wondering
where will you find the money?

441
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:20,440
You can do two jobs until you find
the money to go for your dream.

442
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:26,730
So you're talking about really believing
in yourself and continuing on as well.

443
00:32:26,731 --> 00:32:31,470
Training yourself and learning and
educating yourself and then going for it.

444
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:34,010
Yes, but I'm a be a
little bit against, uh,

445
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,930
the secret and it's philosophy
that think about it, it will come.

446
00:32:36,931 --> 00:32:39,740
Think about no working can,
it will come put on,

447
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:44,820
put in those hours and it will come and
always keep your breach assault pen.

448
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:50,510
My late father used to tell me,
oh, we send a Christmas card.

449
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:54,710
At that time they were sending Christmas
cards, but always send a Christmas card.

450
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:57,500
Always connect with the people
that you meet on the road

451
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:03,530
because your network will determine
your net worth at the end of the day,

452
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,900
not only your abilities.

453
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,540
And I have one more
question if that's okay.

454
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:12,360
He spoke about the turn ours off yourself.

455
00:33:12,361 --> 00:33:15,300
So if you do not mind speaking
to us about that a bit more,

456
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:21,060
I will speak about my true north
beyond possessions,

457
00:33:21,061 --> 00:33:22,410
beyond positions.

458
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:29,360
I agree with my father that you need to
be humble because what else is there to

459
00:33:29,371 --> 00:33:31,500
be and uh,

460
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:36,590
I find my true north when I hugged my
son or when I'm over with my wife and I

461
00:33:37,051 --> 00:33:39,810
think what,
what powers everything is the word trust.

462
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:42,750
If you trust people who are in your life,

463
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:48,350
you have less tension and more trust to
go forward and do what you need to do.

464
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:53,940
You even have allies within your company,
within your relationship,

465
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:56,220
inside your flood or inside your house.

466
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,930
You need allies because no man or woman
is an island. You cannot do it alone.

467
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:05,070
So I have one more question.

468
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:08,130
How do we learn and
navigate around failures?

469
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:14,490
I also said before that when you lose,
don't lose the lesson.

470
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:18,300
If failure is a chance to understand.
For me,

471
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:22,140
when I used to work at the variety
of family business, I always asked,

472
00:34:22,141 --> 00:34:26,340
where did you find us? For you guys?
You know, where did they find you?

473
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,860
It's called Google ad words and the rest.

474
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:34,020
But I w I used to ask and when I fail
at some people, which, what is failure?

475
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:37,650
If you stand up, you're
still standing. Uh,

476
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:42,000
you need to ask what went
wrong. Contemplate, think,

477
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:45,540
look at your offer again.
Uh, talk to people,

478
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:49,710
even to the people who consider
you in inverted commas, failure.

479
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:52,860
So the best way is asking like you,

480
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:56,610
like the Greek contingency is placing
the questions. More questions.

481
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:58,140
Questions are very important.

482
00:34:58,141 --> 00:35:01,830
You judge a man or a woman or a person
by the quality of their questions,

483
00:35:01,831 --> 00:35:03,360
not by the quality of their answers.

484
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:06,030
That's how you deal with
failure with lots of questions.

485
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:12,620
Um, thank you very much for the speech.
I was focusing on the um, the part,

486
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:15,560
your rule of the seven,
seven, seven and also the,

487
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:18,810
the 10,000 hours that you put in.
Um,

488
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,450
I mean you were working full
time for the family business.

489
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:26,010
On top of that you put in 10,000 hours
and now you traveling around the world

490
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:30,480
giving speeches and you still reply
by like seven, seven, seven. Um,

491
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:31,710
w how would he do that?

492
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:36,560
You're contested tonight if
you like. Yes, I fly Emirates.

493
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:41,200
That is wifi connection.
If I'm going transatlantic,

494
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:43,890
yes I do it because

495
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:50,340
if you're a prompt, people attributed
more things to you that you are reliable,

496
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:53,760
that you are dependable, that you
are the one they should work with.

497
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:57,140
And it's also a
differentiator. It's zone. Uh,

498
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:59,400
Marilyn asked me how do
you deal with failures?

499
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:03,000
I also should turn the
question on its head.

500
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,560
How do you deal with success?

501
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:09,830
I ask why beat the American
Pni why did Microsoft hire me?

502
00:36:11,101 --> 00:36:13,710
I asked them and you know,
what's the answer I get?

503
00:36:13,711 --> 00:36:17,490
Most of the Times it's not because you
are the best. Because I said earlier,

504
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:20,620
if you're one in a million
in a 7 billion population,

505
00:36:20,621 --> 00:36:24,020
then another 7,000 people like you,
which they're very good in,

506
00:36:24,021 --> 00:36:25,080
it might have a lower price.

507
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,520
90% told me because your prompt Michael,

508
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,260
because you are the liable because we
were in a hurry to set it up and I knew I

509
00:36:34,261 --> 00:36:36,570
could count on you.
There are other things,

510
00:36:36,571 --> 00:36:40,380
of course you shouldn't stand up here
and talk about fear is that you don't

511
00:36:40,381 --> 00:36:41,214
believe in,

512
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:45,270
you shouldn't talk about others people's
stories except if that's an example

513
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:49,760
that you want twain for
to be truthful and the rest.

514
00:36:49,761 --> 00:36:54,270
So I do it because it's also in my
favor because most people won't do it.

515
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:58,290
Imagine if somebody walks into your
house and you don't greet them because

516
00:36:58,291 --> 00:37:00,510
you're busy.
It's impolite.

517
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:04,890
Somebody is walking into your electronic
house and they're knocking the door.

518
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,610
Thank you very much for the
speech. Mr [inaudible]. Um,

519
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:14,220
how would you define success?
Excellent question.

520
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:18,480
That's why I used the
word elusive for success.

521
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:24,030
It cannot be defined and it cannot
be so broad to include all of us.

522
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:28,680
Success is a different thing
for every different person.

523
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:34,170
If you ask me what success success is,
Christine and Rolando,

524
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:39,710
success for me is to live by the values
that my father instilled in me and my

525
00:37:40,141 --> 00:37:41,010
mother.
Of course,

526
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:46,020
success is to wake up in the morning
and be happy doing what you're doing,

527
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,530
love what you're doing and if you're
not happy with it, I'm not saying quit,

528
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:54,770
but find a way to be happy doing it
and be honest enough if you are not,

529
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,590
if it's after six years,
it really pains.

530
00:37:58,591 --> 00:38:03,591
You find the strength to move on that
success because some people tell me,

531
00:38:05,161 --> 00:38:09,920
my colleague, you are a freelancer,
sometimes you might not work as hard. No,

532
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:14,960
I work hard to see a vision and to go
after that vision with no guarantees.

533
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:20,980
So for me that was success. For
you, it might be something else,

534
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:24,370
but it's elusive as they say.
In theater

535
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:31,380
you got as good as your last performance
and in my job you are as good as your

536
00:38:31,381 --> 00:38:36,040
last speech or training session.
I want to talk a little bit

537
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,760
about your public speaking career and
acknowledge that about half the people in

538
00:38:39,761 --> 00:38:43,090
the Google double office, um, don't
have English as their first language.

539
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,010
So it's a challenge to speak,

540
00:38:45,011 --> 00:38:47,080
but even more so when English
is not your first language.

541
00:38:47,081 --> 00:38:50,380
So can you tell us a little bit about
how you ramped up your communication

542
00:38:50,381 --> 00:38:52,330
skills? How do you practice?
What are your tips?

543
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,820
Excellent. Very good. Because
we are also addressing this one,

544
00:38:55,821 --> 00:38:57,550
the online program that is coming out

545
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:03,060
there was once a great football
player by the name of Malenka spoiler.

546
00:39:03,061 --> 00:39:06,360
It's used to play for my
team in Cyprus or Poland.

547
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:11,370
Malenka was a very talented player,
extremely talented.

548
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,900
He never played in Europe.

549
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,890
He never played in the big
league because he was very slow.

550
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:22,140
And he gave me a piece of
advice. If you're a slow
player, passes the ball faster,

551
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:27,450
the ball travels much faster. And
if you dribble, so if you, if you,

552
00:39:27,451 --> 00:39:30,660
if you are not a native speaker,
it's not the fancy words.

553
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:36,090
Keep it short, keep it simple.
And practice, practice,

554
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,560
practice,
practice.

555
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:39,893
Yeah,

556
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:44,160
perfect. Practice makes perfect.
So try it again and keep it simple.

557
00:39:44,161 --> 00:39:48,120
Even with my mentees, when they come
for coaching sessions one on one, you,

558
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:51,540
even if that is even if their,
if their native language is English,

559
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:55,170
I always tell them, keep
it short. Keep it simple.

560
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:59,370
They gave me 45 minutes, one hour
to speak. I spoke 30 minutes.

561
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:04,340
You shouldn't be keeping you too long
if the people get the juice of what you

562
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:07,290
want to say, it's not the
fancy words and think about it,

563
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:11,130
which is your favorite politician.
My feeling is,

564
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,360
is not someone who uses language
that you can not resonate with,

565
00:40:15,361 --> 00:40:16,410
all understand,

566
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:21,900
but it's someone who speaks to your heart.
Keep it short.

567
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:23,790
Keep it simple and practice.

568
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,430
Okay.

569
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:27,230
Thank you very much.
It was a pleasure.

570
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:32,590
[inaudible].
