10
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,600
Keep Girls Club.
Please join me in welcoming Kelly.

11
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,770
Cool.

12
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,040
We're really excited to have you here.
Let me said he'll be here with you. Great.

13
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,150
So, uh, the word networking sends a
lot of chills or on people with downs,

14
00:00:57,151 --> 00:00:58,770
people's spines,
including my own.

15
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,730
And I might even dare to say there's
other people in the room that would prefer

16
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:06,360
to treat the word networking like an
elephant in the room and maybe maybe keep

17
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:09,210
it a enclosed corners.
But without networking,

18
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,130
your career would have never
gotten to where you are today.

19
00:01:11,131 --> 00:01:12,780
And you talk about this a bit in the book,

20
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:16,410
but would you mind sharing with us how
this idea of networking and how it's

21
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:21,060
creatively developed brought you
from 2002 to where you are today?

22
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:24,050
Yeah, so my uh, my background
is I'm an attorney.

23
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:29,100
I practice law in Canada
in an Inn New York City,

24
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:30,450
made a career change,

25
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:34,950
decided wanted to make a career change
in 2002 and realize I didn't have the

26
00:01:34,951 --> 00:01:39,270
network to do it even though I was looking
for a career within the same industry

27
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,810
and everything synced.

28
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:45,900
Ben has come about because of networks
and relationships and purposely building

29
00:01:50,741 --> 00:01:54,670
strong connections. So is Abby
mentioned, you know the word networking,

30
00:01:55,030 --> 00:02:00,010
put chills in their spine. It puts a
chill in my spine too fast in the book.

31
00:02:00,011 --> 00:02:02,890
I am a reluctant networker.
Um,

32
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,050
I was also very reluctant
in public speaking,

33
00:02:05,051 --> 00:02:08,110
so the universe does really have
a way of coming back at you.

34
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:14,000
When you think of networking is
working a room, y'all think about,

35
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,430
you can say the word networking.
You'd probably imagining cocktail party,

36
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,160
there's a name tag that
you have to pin somewhere.

37
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,150
It probably balancing some sort of
a drink, trying to talk to someone.

38
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,700
Someone introduces you,
you're pulling off, you know,

39
00:02:26,701 --> 00:02:30,080
some satay off a little stick.
He goes the horrors, right?

40
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,220
Like how are you talking about the weather
or something? You're just like, ah,

41
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:39,210
that is not networking. To me,
that's a networking tactic.

42
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,900
But networking to me when you think of
it as an activity is every single human

43
00:02:46,081 --> 00:02:50,370
interaction.
So when you think about your own lives,

44
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,250
for me networking was your
decision to be here today.

45
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,730
You're networking is your
email signature line.

46
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,910
It's the headshot you all have on,
you know,

47
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:04,900
fabulous name tags are on social media.
Um,

48
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,050
it is, um, I dunno,

49
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:10,900
maybe someone leave a voicemail
message for someone else today.

50
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,210
Did you hand out a business
card? Did you, I dunno.

51
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:19,120
Leaving on out of office responder that
says you weren't going to be around to

52
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:24,010
me every time we interact with
someone else that is networking and,

53
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:29,150
and those micro-actions in my mind or
what are more effective in moving our

54
00:03:30,371 --> 00:03:31,210
careers.

55
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:36,280
And our ambitions and our
relationships forward than relying on,

56
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,593
you know,

57
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:42,750
balancing a cocktail plate and handing
out a business card and having something

58
00:03:43,171 --> 00:03:45,730
you know,
smart to say at a cocktail party.

59
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,120
So if networking is an activity I
want you to think of was every human

60
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:51,970
interaction and how can
you do those better.

61
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,370
Networking is a mindset.

62
00:03:54,371 --> 00:03:58,330
I want you to think about it as this
is really hard for a lot of people.

63
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,910
How can you be a decent human being?

64
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:05,320
Because I think that's all we're ever
looking for is how can we have someone who

65
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:09,550
listens to us and is considerate
and the networking as well.

66
00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:12,430
Where do you start when someone
says something foolish to you,

67
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:16,120
like do more networking cause he's
offered that one. That's great.

68
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:20,170
How do I start doing that
is where are you headed?

69
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,053
Where are you going?

70
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:26,020
What are you trying to achieve right
now with the help of other people?

71
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:30,070
And then who are the people who can
help you or the people already in your

72
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:30,880
network.

73
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,450
Are they groups or organizations that
you maybe think you need to join now?

74
00:04:34,451 --> 00:04:36,340
How can you communicate with them better?

75
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:41,290
Because part of networking
is our preference on how
we communicate and engage

76
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,870
and the other is the person you want
to interact with. So I mentioned that.

77
00:04:45,871 --> 00:04:49,360
I said voicemail as as uh,
I think it's an active networking.

78
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,940
My voicemail message,
if anyone calls me,

79
00:04:51,941 --> 00:04:55,600
says please don't leave me a voicemail
message. I don't listen to them.

80
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,890
The number of people who still leave
me a voicemail messages is comical.

81
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,970
And I can tell you what I do with
every single one of them. Delete.

82
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:09,940
I've stated my preference,
text me or email me or tweet me,

83
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,940
do not leave me a voicemail.
I don't listen to these.

84
00:05:12,941 --> 00:05:14,410
And they are with the
Twitter handle again.

85
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,510
So this is a pretty significant rebrand
to the idea of networking and especially

86
00:05:19,511 --> 00:05:22,540
what we hear in business
communities or in, uh,

87
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,030
an MBA session or anything like that.
Well,

88
00:05:25,031 --> 00:05:29,230
I always say we get so
unamortized I to say,

89
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,220
I think we've become so unnevered with
technology and ways things can do things

90
00:05:33,221 --> 00:05:37,900
faster. We don't have to pull out
a paper map anymore, you know,

91
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,080
thankfully who can get us our directions.

92
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:44,140
We can click and swipe and tab.

93
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:50,190
But we need to remember behind all of
this is human beings and we have messy,

94
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:54,430
complicated, you know, unusual lives.

95
00:05:54,431 --> 00:05:57,710
And on any given day, you
know, we can, you know,

96
00:05:57,711 --> 00:06:02,090
be in a good mood or bad mood or you know,
have some trigger that sets us off.

97
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:05,780
And your reaction to something might be
different than my reaction to something.

98
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:10,340
And so I think, you know, if nothing else
from this book and people put people,

99
00:06:10,341 --> 00:06:14,420
put people back in the center
of your networking and think,

100
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:18,200
how can I be someone other
people want to network with?

101
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,380
How can I be the person
I want to network with?

102
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:27,020
And just add that little consideration
into your daily activities and will make

103
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:29,340
all the world of difference.
So digging in

104
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:33,320
a little bit, one of the themes that
Kelly talks about in her book is the give,

105
00:06:33,321 --> 00:06:37,850
give, get theory. And while it might
seem a little bit self explanatory,

106
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:40,130
it would love to hear your
thoughts on how you came to it.

107
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,520
When we're thinking about putting people
back in networking people back and

108
00:06:43,521 --> 00:06:44,350
relationship building.

109
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:47,560
Well let me see the, the, the gift. I mean
it's great to be talking about it here.

110
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:48,410
You know,

111
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:53,410
that Google and in the heart of Silicon
Valley that where there is often been

112
00:06:53,801 --> 00:06:58,030
and has been built on this give,
give, get mentality and that,

113
00:06:58,031 --> 00:07:01,360
but that is sort of one of
those old rules of networking.

114
00:07:01,361 --> 00:07:02,380
I think there's an element of,

115
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,720
of resurrecting ms manners or Craig
Claiborne and wrapping them around our

116
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:11,620
networking activities. Again.
Uh, and the idea is this is,

117
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:12,011
you know,

118
00:07:12,011 --> 00:07:16,950
have you been a good person in
the community within your awkward,

119
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:19,900
within your, with, within
which you are operating.

120
00:07:19,901 --> 00:07:23,170
Have you been that colleague who
has been helpful to other people?

121
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:27,070
Kathryn Finney who is interview
the book is very case study driven.

122
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,920
Kathryn Finney,
one of the interviewees,

123
00:07:29,921 --> 00:07:33,180
and she's has the big
accelerator out of uh,

124
00:07:33,181 --> 00:07:36,350
Atlanta as she says, you know, if you,

125
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,280
if you can't call upon a network,

126
00:07:39,281 --> 00:07:43,210
you probably have a low
return on generosity and
then you need to look at what

127
00:07:43,211 --> 00:07:47,560
your own interactions are. I
think that idea of the give, give,

128
00:07:47,561 --> 00:07:51,460
get though is hard for some people because
there's often a networking imbalance.

129
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,181
You know,

130
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:57,181
you're looking to network with someone
who was higher up a corporate ladder or

131
00:07:57,341 --> 00:08:02,320
someone who apparently has more resources,
connections,

132
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:03,460
then you do.

133
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:06,910
And that's where I come back to what I
said before about being a decent human

134
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,680
being.
Um,

135
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:13,420
are you considerate of somebody else's
time when you're asking them for advice?

136
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,890
Do you follow up and let them know
what you did with that advice?

137
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:22,390
Have you done enough research so that
if you're taking someone's time to ask

138
00:08:22,391 --> 00:08:25,480
them the question, you're asking them
right question the right question.

139
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:29,980
If they've already written it on a blog,
if they shared it on a youtube video,

140
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,560
if they have posted an endlessly,

141
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:36,520
why would you ask a question that you
could find the answer to when a Google

142
00:08:36,521 --> 00:08:40,600
search, you could do
that work, read it all,

143
00:08:40,601 --> 00:08:43,240
take it all in and then
ask them a better question.

144
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,820
In my mind that is networking,
generosity and that is an essential give.

145
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:52,060
I think in this day and age
before you ask for you know,

146
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,460
time,
you know we have two resources in life,

147
00:08:56,461 --> 00:08:59,910
really time and reputation.
One,

148
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,980
you can maybe earn back your reputation,

149
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:05,340
you can never get back your own time and
you can never give back anybody else's

150
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:06,970
time.
So really that,

151
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:12,060
that essential given networking for me
is like doing your homework before you

152
00:09:12,061 --> 00:09:16,620
make that, that asks to maximize
that time and maximize the, the,

153
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,880
the giving of the other
person instead of wisdom and,

154
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:24,930
and realize that that level of
consideration is enough of a,

155
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,990
of a, of a gift. Because like
I said, people like, oh my God,

156
00:09:27,991 --> 00:09:31,230
if I ask someone for you
know, an introduction, what
am I going to give them?

157
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,180
You don't need to give
them an equal introduction.

158
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:36,090
You may never have that opportunity
and they may never want it.

159
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:41,130
But you can give them consideration.
You can give them that kindness,

160
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,650
you can give them that
thoughtfulness and that,

161
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:46,410
I mean it sounds like a
really low base level,

162
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:51,510
but the number of people who,
who sort of like this is all we need.

163
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,770
Uh, one of the other people interviewed
in the book is Alison Levine.

164
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,610
Ellison is,

165
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,220
and how many friends do you get
to see in life or an adventurer?

166
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,030
And she's a best selling author,
but she's also an adventure.

167
00:10:06,031 --> 00:10:11,031
She has led the first all us women's
team up Everest amongst other

168
00:10:11,281 --> 00:10:14,070
accomplishments in mountains,
literally that she has climbed.

169
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:19,410
And when I asked her about, you know,
networking, generosity, what was the give,

170
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,660
because of course she's
accomplished so much.

171
00:10:21,661 --> 00:10:26,220
People ask her for so much and she just
said, you know what, just be considerate.

172
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,710
Be considerate about the
time that you're asking for.

173
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,200
Get be considered about
what you're asking for.

174
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,130
Don't ask me if I've climbed Everest,
you know, Google search will reveal that.

175
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,490
And she was so adamant on this,
I had to call her and say, Allie,

176
00:10:38,491 --> 00:10:42,810
I need to edit your answers for my book
because if I kept her original answers,

177
00:10:42,811 --> 00:10:46,350
the book would come in a brown paper
wrapper with a parental warning.

178
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:51,930
A lot of all caps,
lot of imaginative words.

179
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,860
Uh, it's, it, it sounds crazy, but
like just that little consideration,

180
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,910
it makes all the difference.

181
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,200
So Alison was actually at Google
last week and now you're making me,

182
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,480
I'm going to watch her talk when
it was recording. She sounds,

183
00:11:03,481 --> 00:11:04,420
it sounds fantastic.

184
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,310
Like seriously, if you missed
her person, watch her talk.

185
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:11,680
Alison Levine is extraordinary.
Okay,

186
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,163
fantastic.

187
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:18,170
So on that idea of frequent networking
asks that we might get or questions that

188
00:11:20,101 --> 00:11:20,701
might come in often,

189
00:11:20,701 --> 00:11:23,880
especially for someone like you
who identifies as a connector, uh,

190
00:11:23,881 --> 00:11:28,650
one of the ideas I wanted to run through
by Kelly was to self assess and look at

191
00:11:28,651 --> 00:11:33,300
some of the networking emails I've sent
or I've received with leading questions.

192
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:36,960
And I want to read these out cause I
think these are often networking crutches

193
00:11:36,961 --> 00:11:39,810
that we land on.
I want to pick your brain about something.

194
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,670
Talk to the hand on that one.

195
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,280
Don't send that email and we'll break
it down and break some of these down

196
00:11:47,281 --> 00:11:51,420
afterwards. But if you think
of anyone for this, nope.

197
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:56,860
Nope. Oh, do you have any
opportunities in mind for me to grow?

198
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,360
You mean you don't know everything
about my personal and professional

199
00:12:01,361 --> 00:12:03,890
development?
Uh,

200
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:09,370
do you know anyone that might
want to cover this story
or give me some publicity?

201
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:13,570
The number of that last one,
the number of times I get that from,

202
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:17,770
from emerging tech companies who hired
PR firms and that's what they email me.

203
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,330
Oh,
for the love of God.

204
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:24,210
So as someone who's relatively young in
their career and when I'm thinking about

205
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:26,670
networking horizontal or
networking vertically,

206
00:12:26,671 --> 00:12:30,420
and I'm talking to folks that I know I
want to make the most value their time,

207
00:12:30,421 --> 00:12:35,130
but I also don't want to overstep. I don't
want to come off as a asking too much.

208
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:39,660
So sometimes it can feel more comfortable
to go back to these general statements.

209
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,000
Questions are asking too much.

210
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:47,190
Think about an email you get from a
friend that says, I'm looking for a job.

211
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,270
How does that feel when you get that?
You're like, I don't know where to start.

212
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,850
Yeah,
so what do you have to start by doing?

213
00:12:53,851 --> 00:12:56,370
You have to start by asking a lot of
questions and we're racking your brain.

214
00:12:56,371 --> 00:12:57,120
Well,

215
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,920
did you want a job at Google or where
you were looking for a job at Walmart?

216
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,750
I don't know.
Like what are you looking for?

217
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,770
And when you ask big general questions,

218
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:14,900
you're making your network do the work
for you rather than giving them that

219
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:18,370
target. Think about like darks. You gotta,

220
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,910
you know like you've got a
target that you're going for.

221
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:25,470
Tell them what your bullseye eye is
because then we have a radius of ways to

222
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:29,700
help you. So if you said, hey, I'm
looking for a job at x and you're like,

223
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,410
I don't know anyone at x, but I know
someone at why I don't know anyone at NBC,

224
00:13:34,411 --> 00:13:36,810
but I know someone at ABC,
would you want to talk to them?

225
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:40,560
We have something to aim at. But if you
said, I'm just looking for a new job,

226
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,960
I don't know what to shoot for and now
you put the work on me and that is too

227
00:13:45,961 --> 00:13:46,920
heavy of an ask.

228
00:13:46,921 --> 00:13:51,720
I think our networks have
been extraordinarily strained
when I think of it from

229
00:13:51,721 --> 00:13:54,690
a,
probably about 2009.

230
00:13:54,691 --> 00:13:59,460
When you think the economic collapse
and uh, you know, Lehman brothers,

231
00:13:59,461 --> 00:14:02,940
all of that stuff going on in people's
strained and looking for opportunities.

232
00:14:02,941 --> 00:14:07,530
I think our networks are strained
because our nature of work has changed.

233
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:12,740
So many of us do freelance
or we're looking to get
opportunities and experiences

234
00:14:13,981 --> 00:14:17,160
with, with within one company
and then we're moving to another.

235
00:14:17,161 --> 00:14:21,690
So we're constantly moving in and
out of opportunities and networks.

236
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:25,200
So you're better off and you're,
you're helping your network,

237
00:14:25,201 --> 00:14:28,890
you're helping yourself and you're
helping you get a better answer if you're

238
00:14:28,891 --> 00:14:33,880
specific and people are afraid
of going specific and, and, and,

239
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,340
and maybe they're afraid
of doing the work,

240
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:36,510
but there are a lot of people say to me,

241
00:14:36,511 --> 00:14:39,540
but if I do all that research and ask
the question, I have to do a lot of work.

242
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,340
And I'm like, yeah, that's a
point. That's why it's network.

243
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:46,770
So that work word in it,
but it's also, you know,

244
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,640
if you get off on just sending 50 emails
saying, Hey, I'm looking for a job,

245
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:54,710
can you help me this time sitting
around waiting for an answer as time,

246
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:57,830
why not do the research?

247
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,090
Find a smaller group of people within
your network who can provide you with the

248
00:15:02,091 --> 00:15:05,210
right answer or closer
to the right answer.

249
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:09,620
Spend your spend your networking
time on that front end doing that.

250
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:14,240
Ask a better question. You don't
need 50 people emailing you back.

251
00:15:14,241 --> 00:15:18,410
You need one or two and email you back
with the right opportunity. I think so,

252
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:22,700
yes to all of that. And to give a plug
here, buck and build your dream network.

253
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:26,270
You, one of the things that I loved about
this focus that you talked about how to

254
00:15:26,271 --> 00:15:28,520
figure out what you're asking
in the networking anyways,

255
00:15:28,521 --> 00:15:32,540
you should have a goal in mind.
And sometimes we know that this,

256
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,480
this ambiguous networking
concept is important,

257
00:15:35,481 --> 00:15:37,670
but we don't know why we
need to be doing it. So,

258
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:40,700
and that brings to random
acts and networking. But when,

259
00:15:40,701 --> 00:15:43,380
when you think of what you started,
like the bad name on networking. Like I,

260
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,530
if I don't know why I'm
in a networking room,

261
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:50,540
I mean I'm equally sweaty palms and
anxious as anyone else. I'm like, wait,

262
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,240
why am I here? What am I going to talk
about? But if I know why I'm there,

263
00:15:53,241 --> 00:15:55,610
if I've made a conscious
decision to be there,

264
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:00,350
it's a heck of a lot easier to
kind of figure out. All right,

265
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:03,520
what are we going to talk about?
Um, what's, what's an introduction?

266
00:16:03,521 --> 00:16:07,280
We question that I would want to say
to someone or if my networking is,

267
00:16:07,281 --> 00:16:11,000
I just need to discover what this group
or organization or association is all

268
00:16:11,001 --> 00:16:11,834
about.

269
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:16,670
I'm happy to go and sit quietly and
assess the landscape to understand, right?

270
00:16:16,671 --> 00:16:18,770
Do I want to spend more
time here in the future?

271
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,190
But that all should aligned back to
the goals that you have set before even

272
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:26,240
walking into the room. Otherwise
you run around like with chicken,

273
00:16:26,241 --> 00:16:29,090
with your head cut off and
listen, our time is, look,

274
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,300
we have not been able to hack time,
still only 24 hours looking on that.

275
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,250
Know, maybe someone's working on
it here, you know, uh, you know,

276
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,550
we can just reverse this
every once in a while. Um, um,

277
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,300
met George Takei at a south by a
few years ago and I said to her,

278
00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:45,850
I'm still mad with star trek.
We don't have that, you know,

279
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:48,410
beam me up Scotty technology,
that would be good too.

280
00:16:48,411 --> 00:16:51,650
But so we don't have more time in the day.
And for many of us,

281
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,830
you know what work is important.

282
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:58,370
There's other things that are important
and your network is also important for

283
00:16:58,371 --> 00:16:59,510
your community service.

284
00:16:59,511 --> 00:17:04,010
It may be important for other things in
your life and frankly just having time

285
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,920
to be with you know,

286
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:09,500
other people that are close to
you like make a priority for that.

287
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,920
So you know, I'm very much
about efficiency, you know,

288
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,540
maybe it's women multitasking,

289
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:18,710
how can you pack more into things we're
already doing rather to add more things

290
00:17:18,711 --> 00:17:21,650
on when our time is
limited. Great. Thank you.

291
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,980
I would say for folks that are
interested more in about goal setting and

292
00:17:24,981 --> 00:17:27,440
thinking about those,
those metal levels of career development,

293
00:17:27,441 --> 00:17:29,360
I would highly recommend
checking out the book.

294
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,230
The chapters on goal setting helped me a
lot personally with thinking about time

295
00:17:33,231 --> 00:17:37,370
at Google and it made some
of those networking questions
a little bit clear and

296
00:17:37,371 --> 00:17:39,860
some of the steps easier to just apply.

297
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:44,930
One of the early readers of my
books called me up and said,

298
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:47,420
I've got some bad news about your
book. And I said, what's the bad news?

299
00:17:47,421 --> 00:17:50,160
And she's like, it's not about
networking. And I'm like, yeah, I had,

300
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,030
I had that suspicion, I
had that suspicion. Uh,

301
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:58,120
and I think it is a bigger look at what
is it that you want to achieve and you

302
00:17:59,821 --> 00:18:01,530
achieve things with the
help of other people.

303
00:18:01,531 --> 00:18:05,610
Now how can you form better relationships
and how can you focus what you're

304
00:18:05,611 --> 00:18:07,920
doing so you can achieve it.

305
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:12,780
So the case studies in the book range
from working up the corporate ladder to

306
00:18:12,781 --> 00:18:17,520
crowdfunding to getting on
a national board to, uh,

307
00:18:17,521 --> 00:18:21,170
I wouldn't say landing a job
right out of college. Um,

308
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:24,600
how Tina Roth Eisenberg
created creative mornings.

309
00:18:24,601 --> 00:18:27,870
I've global network for the
creative community. So it's, it's,

310
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:33,080
it's more than just how you balance the
and work room and it has gotten a few

311
00:18:33,841 --> 00:18:38,070
people thinking about Ra, where, what
do I want to achieve with my career?

312
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:41,310
Um,
what do I want to do after I retire?

313
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:46,560
I have a friend's mom inspired to start
her own business after she retires is a

314
00:18:46,561 --> 00:18:49,740
school teacher in June
because she read the book.

315
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:51,841
That's pretty cool.

316
00:18:51,841 --> 00:18:54,450
It's gonna be exciting to see where this
book brings people over the years as

317
00:18:54,451 --> 00:18:58,590
well. Sure you're gonna be getting
some fun emails or tweets and those,

318
00:18:58,591 --> 00:18:59,910
and those are the things
that mattered to me.

319
00:18:59,911 --> 00:19:04,400
Like when I get those to think that, you
know, something is unlocked, you know,

320
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:09,180
something for someone else and now they
can pursue a path to their own success.

321
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,190
So in very gratifying in that.

322
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:16,470
So I want to jump back to something you
were talking about earlier around our us

323
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:20,610
owning our relations are a part of the,
our reputation and owning our time.

324
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,840
And one thing that really stood out to
me in the book was you kept bringing back

325
00:19:24,841 --> 00:19:26,940
this idea of who knows what you know,

326
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:29,700
or the way I would rephrase
it as what are you known for?

327
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:34,620
And I think my question for you right
off the bat would be how do you know who

328
00:19:34,621 --> 00:19:38,890
knows what, you know, I mean,

329
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:43,350
cause I put part of their, I see that
is, is I think about how we've evolved,

330
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,680
how the job market,
um,

331
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:50,940
and opportunities have evolved from who
you know and all those insider networks,

332
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:56,550
you know, to maybe what, you know,
cause it was a world driven by help.

333
00:19:56,551 --> 00:20:01,440
Wanted and recruiters and classify ads
to now a world that where I put it is,

334
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:05,930
it's not who you know or what you
know, but who knows what you know. Um,

335
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,380
and I mentioned this in the book.

336
00:20:07,381 --> 00:20:12,060
I remember when I was researching and
I pulled up something and it popped up.

337
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:15,750
I know it was in Linkedin.
It popped up an opportunity at Google.

338
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:19,140
So I went and clicked on it
and then it said, by the way,

339
00:20:19,141 --> 00:20:23,190
who do you know at Google one at you
contact them? And I'm like, yeah,

340
00:20:23,191 --> 00:20:27,990
what is the information you're sharing
with your network in terms of what your

341
00:20:27,991 --> 00:20:32,910
interests are? Uh, you know,
what maybe you want to do next?

342
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,000
What in your life and your
career that you want more of?

343
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:39,390
Because the signals you send out,
maybe you know,

344
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:43,050
the stuff that starts coming to you as
the opportunities that you're really

345
00:20:43,051 --> 00:20:46,290
seeking. So if you look at it,
go and look at your own profiles.

346
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:50,020
Go and look at the information that
you're sharing, whether it's in person,

347
00:20:50,021 --> 00:20:53,710
online, or offline, uh,
with your community.

348
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:56,860
Because you may be sending out the wrong
signals in terms of what you want to be

349
00:20:56,861 --> 00:20:57,694
found for.

350
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,660
I know like my profile and you don't
see anything about being a lawyer.

351
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:05,860
It is so buried and so minimal with
search words and everything else.

352
00:21:05,861 --> 00:21:08,680
Cause Lord knows I don't
want to be contacted on that.

353
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:14,250
So when we're thinking about our email
signatures or our Twitter headlines or

354
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:17,980
even our bios on our
internal job search boards,

355
00:21:17,981 --> 00:21:21,220
do you think that those should all
be the same and we should have it,

356
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:25,230
we should know what people
are identifying us. Make,

357
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:28,300
make sure it's powerfully moving forward.
Your ambition,

358
00:21:28,301 --> 00:21:31,120
if you're posting things online,
you know,

359
00:21:31,121 --> 00:21:35,770
what are the stories that you're sharing,
if, if, you know, are you sharing,

360
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,940
if you're sharing rich content that is
dealing with your professional and your

361
00:21:39,941 --> 00:21:41,380
career interests in,

362
00:21:41,381 --> 00:21:44,740
or are you sharing in a way that people
are identifying with something that you

363
00:21:44,741 --> 00:21:49,270
either are an expert in or you want to
move into or something that you care

364
00:21:49,271 --> 00:21:54,250
about? Uh, we have that ability in
mobility to move between things. I mean,

365
00:21:54,251 --> 00:21:58,780
my own personal story was, um, in 2011,

366
00:21:58,781 --> 00:22:02,980
2012, I co founded a startup
accelerator. It was not my idea though.

367
00:22:02,981 --> 00:22:04,180
I was one of the cofounders,

368
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,920
the original idea came from my two
cofounders and they realized in launching

369
00:22:08,921 --> 00:22:13,600
this nutty, crazy idea that they
needed somebody else to help them.

370
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:18,820
And they kept talking to people and
describing the skillset and the abilities

371
00:22:18,821 --> 00:22:22,420
that they were in the background.
They were looking in this third cofounder,

372
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:26,680
nameless, third cofounder
and my name kept coming up.

373
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,100
Everyone kept saying, you know what?
He'd started to Kelly, you know,

374
00:22:30,101 --> 00:22:34,030
you should talk to, you should
talk to Kelly. So what do
you want to be known for?

375
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:38,950
A network that, that experience
network, that ambition,

376
00:22:38,951 --> 00:22:42,910
network, that skillset, but people
know what you're interested in.

377
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:45,340
Cause they may be like, oh, I
know who you're looking for.

378
00:22:45,341 --> 00:22:48,190
You're looking for someone like Kelly,
are you looking for someone like Abby,

379
00:22:48,191 --> 00:22:51,430
let me re you should talk to them.
Sounds like a great opportunity.

380
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,760
And that's how everything in my life
has happened really since 2009 for folks

381
00:22:58,151 --> 00:23:00,850
that are listening in right now
and saying, that sounds great,

382
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,720
I need to update my
headline or my goodness,

383
00:23:04,721 --> 00:23:08,890
I don't know what people know me for
right now. Do you have any take actions?

384
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,430
And I want to say a quick win.

385
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:14,200
They areas that people can take away
today to start to change their headline

386
00:23:14,201 --> 00:23:16,590
changed, but they're known for.
Right? Well, I mean the take,

387
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:20,950
take an audit of every place where you're
interacting with other people and say,

388
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,320
you know, is this, is
there's this consistency.

389
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:26,800
Is this networking me forward
in the way I want to be found?

390
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:31,090
And then stop and think and
say, all right, how is my
network interacting with me?

391
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,930
What are they asking me for? How
are they engaging with me? Now?

392
00:23:34,931 --> 00:23:37,780
How much of that is my network?
Like,

393
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:42,900
do I have the right mix of people in it
in terms of relationships and diversity,

394
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,290
uh, and, or how is my terms of
engagement with it that, you know,

395
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:51,890
I've enabled them to keep calling, calling
me back and asking for these things.

396
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,350
It's a little, you know,
so it's a little of both.

397
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:58,310
So go and go and do that audit
and sort of assess and say, oops,

398
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,420
what needs to shift and change?
Great action item for me.

399
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:09,020
I do it myself. I mean, I would say it is
one of those things, it's kind of funny.

400
00:24:09,021 --> 00:24:11,290
Write a book on networking and you know,

401
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:15,290
they have to eat your own dog food and
I have to follow the advice between the

402
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:20,270
two covers. So I'm not just sitting up
here flippantly tossing, tossing out, oh,

403
00:24:20,271 --> 00:24:22,970
you should do this. He's
like, I have to do it myself.

404
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:27,540
And I do catch myself the so,
wow.

405
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:31,460
So you actually just started
to touch on something that I'm,

406
00:24:31,461 --> 00:24:35,260
I'm excited you brought up around
diversity of networks and um,

407
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:39,550
these where we find these groupings
and we actually had a great speaker at

408
00:24:39,551 --> 00:24:41,680
Google last year,
a terror Winston.

409
00:24:41,681 --> 00:24:43,920
I'm not sure if other folks
are able to tune in a,

410
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:45,160
she's from interacting consulting.

411
00:24:45,161 --> 00:24:48,970
It was giving a skills building session
at Google last year and she had a quote

412
00:24:48,971 --> 00:24:52,240
that stood out to me, uh, that
I'd love to hear your thoughts on.

413
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:57,010
She said she warned us against putting
your entire network in the same food

414
00:24:57,011 --> 00:25:01,330
chain and I'll leave it at that.
I'd love to hear what you think about that

415
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,241
physician.
I was in,

416
00:25:03,241 --> 00:25:08,241
in 2002 I had a network that was very
narrow and very deep within the legal

417
00:25:08,701 --> 00:25:13,230
industry, but very particular within
the legal industry. It was, you know,

418
00:25:13,231 --> 00:25:18,180
New York City in Toronto. It was
bankers, investment bankers, Wall Street.

419
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:21,330
Um,
I'm going to say trustees.

420
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:25,080
It was within a very
narrow area of practice.

421
00:25:25,081 --> 00:25:29,970
And even though then my next career
move I saw within the legal industry,

422
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:31,823
you know,

423
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:35,490
I had nowhere to go unless I wanted to
go a general counsel and move to another

424
00:25:35,491 --> 00:25:37,140
firm and do the same thing.

425
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:41,430
And so that was a big wake up call for me.

426
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,520
So I'm doing this because there's
basically two types of networks.

427
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:49,580
Some of them are associated with gender
and some of it I want to say like I

428
00:25:50,071 --> 00:25:52,110
described my own legal career.
Some of us,

429
00:25:52,111 --> 00:25:54,540
because of our industry in our profession,

430
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,690
we do this with our network.

431
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:01,610
It becomes very expertise in very narrow.
So there's an,

432
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,340
there's a narrow deep network
that's often associated with women,

433
00:26:05,341 --> 00:26:08,070
the types of networks they have.
As I described it,

434
00:26:08,071 --> 00:26:10,080
I had to guess I had the
double whammy on that.

435
00:26:10,081 --> 00:26:13,440
I also had it cause I was a lawyer
doing a particular area of law.

436
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,130
The power and that network
is, that's where you have
people who've got your back.

437
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:21,690
Um, they're the people who you
know, can give you that feedback.

438
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,140
Maybe some deep mentorship. They
really know you well. That team,

439
00:26:25,141 --> 00:26:27,360
you can instantly pull together.
On a project.

440
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:31,470
When you have a narrow deep network,
you can already see the problem with it.

441
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,670
It doesn't create a lot of opportunities.
So the other network is a broad,

442
00:26:35,671 --> 00:26:38,910
shallow network that's
typically associated with the
types of relationships that

443
00:26:38,911 --> 00:26:41,340
men have.
The reality is you need both.

444
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:46,800
You need those ties, those loose
ties or where opportunity comes from.

445
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,050
You may not be able to get deep feedback,

446
00:26:49,051 --> 00:26:51,300
but you can sure spread
a message in a long way.

447
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,810
You share can find someone
to go, Oh God, yeah, right.

448
00:26:54,811 --> 00:26:56,670
I went to college with
someone who's doing that.

449
00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:00,580
Let me reach out to them and see
if they're interested in, you know,

450
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:05,010
talking about it or meeting or whatever.
You need both of those.

451
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,260
And the reality is our lives do that.
You know,

452
00:27:07,261 --> 00:27:11,690
you thinking about when you are in college
and then those relationships ab out

453
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,320
this way further and further,

454
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:17,250
but find ways to keep those people
in your periphery. I mean our,

455
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:21,810
we're a case study of
that quote in many ways.

456
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:24,870
If you had had just said,
all right,

457
00:27:24,871 --> 00:27:29,790
I had my nice internship for two
months in New York City in 2012.

458
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:32,770
Thanks very much. See you later. Yeah,

459
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:36,950
when I today here today,
right.

460
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,010
So Abby had been my intern and I think
that's also when you think about food

461
00:27:41,011 --> 00:27:44,430
chain, we often think of
networking is up the food chain.

462
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:48,630
And the reality is we
live in a three 60 world.

463
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:53,760
You never know where opportunities are
going to come from. Your next boss may be,

464
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,640
you know,
30 years old or 30 years younger

465
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:02,730
was sort of nurture and take care
of all the relationships around you.

466
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:06,900
Back to being that decent human being.
Cause you never know.

467
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:08,580
You never know who's going to mentor you.

468
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,520
You never know where who's was an
opportunity's going to come from.

469
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,540
You never know who you can help.
And that just kind of creates that,

470
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,960
that vibrancy and resiliency in a network,

471
00:28:18,961 --> 00:28:23,930
which in my mind creates the vibrancy
and resiliency in your own career. Great.

472
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:24,923
Thank you.

473
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:29,790
Um, I have a lot of more questions,
quite a few more questions. Um,

474
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,130
around social media.

475
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,710
You've talked a lot about generosity
and how that plays in the network and,

476
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:38,480
but right now I want to ask you one
more question then I want to open up to

477
00:28:38,481 --> 00:28:42,390
folks on live stream and in
the room for questions. So uh,

478
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,350
start thinking about him or put them in
the door if you feel more comfortable.

479
00:28:45,351 --> 00:28:49,030
But my last question for
you for now would be, um,

480
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:53,000
if anyone's here was to go home and
change only one thing about their know how

481
00:28:53,001 --> 00:28:54,140
they network,
what would it be?

482
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:59,580
Change. One thing, it's like
the hunger games of your book.

483
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:01,951
You don't know what to do.

484
00:29:01,951 --> 00:29:04,900
I said it to two different than these
are the biggest networking gives him

485
00:29:04,901 --> 00:29:09,660
office to as what is the
biggest networking mistake
people make and the biggest

486
00:29:09,661 --> 00:29:12,120
networking mistake people make
is a failure to follow up.

487
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:17,700
And I don't mean by that, the hey Abby,
you know the email I could send that say,

488
00:29:17,701 --> 00:29:20,790
hey Abby, thanks for very much
for arranging this chat today.

489
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:25,590
It's when could I follow
up a month from now when?

490
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:29,250
Is there some time that you crossed
my mind that I could follow up again?

491
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,910
And that failure to follow
up with a piece of advice,

492
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:38,220
maybe an introduction someone
made, um, whatever it may be.

493
00:29:38,221 --> 00:29:40,020
And if you do nothing else from today,

494
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:44,900
like go back to your desk and you know,
whatever,

495
00:29:44,901 --> 00:29:47,410
sit there and look at your
calendar and think, right,

496
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,670
where is someone who has done something
for me that other than the hey,

497
00:29:51,671 --> 00:29:52,510
thanks a lot.

498
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:57,550
Where can I circle back and let them
know what I've done with that guidance or

499
00:29:57,551 --> 00:30:02,551
how something turned out and that that
type of follow up changes things within

500
00:30:04,181 --> 00:30:06,490
networks and that changes relationships.

501
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,910
So if you do one thing from
today and change one thing,

502
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,340
like mastered the art of the followup,

503
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:17,200
that's a great note to take some
questions on. Thank you so much. Um,

504
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:21,700
I want to first open it up to the room
and see if we have any last questions.

505
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:25,150
I have a question on the gender issue.
So yeah,

506
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:28,960
Hindi aren't met and we met very
different in networking styles.

507
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:32,050
And how does that
differentiate the two genders,

508
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:36,220
South Korea development?
That is a terrific question.

509
00:30:36,221 --> 00:30:38,740
In terms of networking
and career development.

510
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:45,310
Here's the two things that are
running through my mind. Um,

511
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:49,390
one is for people earlier in their
career, I often recommend them. I said,

512
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:53,530
look at what it takes for other people
to be successful in the area you want to

513
00:30:53,531 --> 00:30:57,610
go into. And part of how they're
successful is not just the knowledge base,

514
00:30:57,611 --> 00:31:00,130
it's how they interact and ask yourself,

515
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,180
will I be in successful
within that interaction.

516
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:07,870
So I knew I could be
successful as a legal career,

517
00:31:07,871 --> 00:31:12,610
but if I'd chosen to be a tax attorney
I would have been an abject failure.

518
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,000
Their way of networking is very technical.

519
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:20,890
It is very research driven and it's very
paper driven in terms of writing papers

520
00:31:20,891 --> 00:31:24,640
and things and giving, sending
updates. That is not me.

521
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,990
I was much better off hanging out as I
used to refer to them with my frat boy,

522
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,870
Wall Street clients.
Cause you know,

523
00:31:31,871 --> 00:31:35,170
giving someone a Tequila shot was a heck
of a lot easier than spending endless

524
00:31:35,171 --> 00:31:38,080
hours researching.
But that was my personality type.

525
00:31:38,081 --> 00:31:41,020
So look ahead and say
how do they interact.

526
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:46,470
I also think this is where there is
power in knowing why you want to seek the

527
00:31:49,331 --> 00:31:50,980
advice of other people.

528
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:54,550
Because we all operate within,

529
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,510
I would say proximity in communities
that they may have their patterns of

530
00:31:58,511 --> 00:32:00,850
interactions and how you can,

531
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,460
you may not want to completely disrupted,

532
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,610
but you want to be part
of the conversation.

533
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:11,820
And this is where you have to find those
opportunities to seek out people in my

534
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:17,770
mind on their advice and their guidance
of how they can help you. So for example,

535
00:32:17,771 --> 00:32:21,550
to reach out to someone and say,
please explain to me, you know,

536
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:23,560
why this happened in your career.

537
00:32:23,561 --> 00:32:28,390
Like how did you make the
move from HR to engineering?

538
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,250
That intrigues me and it
doesn't seem to be, you know,

539
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,310
a linear career process.
How did that come about?

540
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:40,760
People want to talk and share
that of particular advice.

541
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:45,080
And so when do you find yourself within
an environment that you don't think,

542
00:32:45,081 --> 00:32:47,930
well I'm not going to go out
and do that type of networking?

543
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:49,510
Yeah.

544
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:53,680
Find other ways to have conversation
that focuses back on the nature of work.

545
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:57,550
Does that help build a Doherty question?

546
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:02,390
So what advice do you have for introverts?
Oh, this is my favorite question.

547
00:33:02,391 --> 00:33:05,320
Advice for introverts can,
we didn't talk about this.

548
00:33:05,321 --> 00:33:09,760
I did mention that the buck is case
study driven and I saw people within my

549
00:33:09,761 --> 00:33:14,080
network that had a particular
outcome and I said,

550
00:33:14,081 --> 00:33:19,081
I need you to unpack this because I have
a suspicion that you have achieved this

551
00:33:20,481 --> 00:33:24,190
school in a networked way
by building relationships,

552
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:27,910
seeking the help of others,
building your own expertise,

553
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:32,650
sharing that within your network and
moving towards whatever your goal is,

554
00:33:32,651 --> 00:33:36,380
whether it's up the corporate
ladder, starting a, um,

555
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:39,910
I would say a venture capital
fund, climbing Everest, et cetera.

556
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:45,490
So I sent out questions to these people
in my book and I did not ask them one

557
00:33:45,491 --> 00:33:49,210
question. I didn't ask them
their personality type. I
didn't ask, how'd you turn?

558
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:52,630
How'd you do on the Myers Briggs?
You know, how'd you do? No,

559
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:55,240
didn't ask that question.
And my answer's started coming back.

560
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,000
Most of the people are,

561
00:33:57,050 --> 00:34:02,050
we're featured in the book are introverts
and not a little bit introverted,

562
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:04,810
really introverted.

563
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:09,760
I think in this day and age when we
are bombarded with opportunities and

564
00:34:09,761 --> 00:34:12,640
information online and off and choice,

565
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:17,710
I think people who are more purposeful
and conscientious and how they network

566
00:34:17,711 --> 00:34:18,970
are better networkers.

567
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:24,400
And my guess is those are introverts
in managing your own discomfort,

568
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:30,030
in managing your concern on what you're
asking may be and how it may feel or

569
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:31,600
impose on someone else,

570
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:36,930
I think you're better positioned
to succeed then extroverts.

571
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:40,720
I'm going to go really out on
a limb and say that one. Uh,

572
00:34:40,721 --> 00:34:45,340
so my advice to introverts is anytime
someone sends you a networking tip that

573
00:34:45,341 --> 00:34:48,340
says, you know, maybe it's a
link to an article that's hey,

574
00:34:48,341 --> 00:34:52,090
10 things introverts can do to it, you
know, network more like extroverts.

575
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:55,870
I want you to hit delete immediately.
Someone sends you that advice.

576
00:34:55,871 --> 00:34:57,040
I want you to ignore it.

577
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:03,220
Continue to be conscientious to compete
in you, to be purposeful, you know,

578
00:35:03,221 --> 00:35:07,420
continue to understand why it is you
need to undertake networking activities.

579
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:11,650
One of the great case studies in the book,
he's a guy by the name of Joe Styler.

580
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:13,510
Joe Is at Godaddy.

581
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:19,380
He networked his way up from the help
desk to the aftermarkets department.

582
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:23,260
So cause I like to say,
you know,

583
00:35:23,261 --> 00:35:26,440
in my way from being in New York
and on Wall Street, you know,

584
00:35:26,441 --> 00:35:29,740
from being the receptionist at
Goldman Sachs to lead trader,

585
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:34,120
he's made that change in his career,
networking,

586
00:35:34,121 --> 00:35:38,650
building his expertise, moving his
career forward within his industry, um,

587
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:43,560
very purposefully and very intentionally
with it and go daddy. And he's like,

588
00:35:43,561 --> 00:35:46,530
hey, there's things I know I have
to do that, you know, I'm not,

589
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,190
if I look at my personality type,
I know I'm not comfortable doing them,

590
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:55,080
but I understand now why I need to
do them so I can step into that room.

591
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:58,690
And he's so purposeful and
so well researched anytime.

592
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:00,360
I think it's to manage that discomfort.

593
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:05,540
But his case study is an absolutely
brilliant one in terms of someone who is

594
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,590
introverted,
moving their career forward.

595
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:12,450
Because if he had succumb to into
introversion and just been told, you know,

596
00:36:12,451 --> 00:36:16,170
go network, go work cocktail parties,
you'd probably still be, you know, hey,

597
00:36:16,171 --> 00:36:17,910
thanks for calling, go daddy, this is Joe.

598
00:36:17,911 --> 00:36:22,890
How can I help you instead of in a very
fulfilling role within that company and

599
00:36:22,891 --> 00:36:26,940
within the industry. A tactical
question on Linkedin, uh,

600
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:31,980
what is your thoughts on the linkedin
open networkers and how can you use them

601
00:36:32,771 --> 00:36:37,430
as a resource? Uh, struggling with
that. They open networkers attempts,

602
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:41,080
people actively connecting
with other people on Linkedin,
right? So they, you know,

603
00:36:41,081 --> 00:36:43,630
if you send them a connection,
you don't have any connection with them,

604
00:36:43,631 --> 00:36:47,440
they will automatically approve you
in their network. I want to know why.

605
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:50,650
So one of the things they,
the benefits they do,

606
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,930
which may not be a
benefit for individuals,

607
00:36:52,931 --> 00:36:56,980
but they are able to connect groups that
are not actually connected together.

608
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:59,800
So there's a good society
that these people play.

609
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:04,350
But I didn't know how other as
a individually, tactically, uh,

610
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:07,390
for those folks. Yeah. I mean,
here's the thing. I mean I

611
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:12,910
as a networking platform and
to date myself as a Rolodex,

612
00:37:12,911 --> 00:37:17,470
as a way of keeping eyeballs on contacts
and thinking about who and when to

613
00:37:17,471 --> 00:37:22,471
contact people depending on where I'm
going or industries I'm looking into.

614
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:27,670
I'm a massive fan of linkedin. Um, and
I think also too, it is revealed to us,

615
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,170
you know,
it's not only your own network,

616
00:37:29,171 --> 00:37:34,171
it is the second and third
degree connections and sort
of unveiling that concept

617
00:37:34,791 --> 00:37:36,160
to people hadn't heard of it.

618
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:40,930
I think it's vitally important
that like Linkedin as a platform.

619
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:42,880
But there's two things with linkedin.

620
00:37:42,881 --> 00:37:47,380
I think we look at it as a platform and
technology and we forget that people use

621
00:37:47,381 --> 00:37:51,610
it differently and we use it
differently at different points in time.

622
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:57,100
So I request to connect without a,
without a personal message,

623
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,870
I think is meaningless.
Tell me, remind me,

624
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,910
prompt me how and why.

625
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:06,940
And then when you do
that with other people,

626
00:38:06,941 --> 00:38:11,380
also remember some of us may be
using the network differently.

627
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:14,890
I know some people who use
linkedin very closed off.

628
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:20,020
If we haven't sat, you know, face
to face. If we haven't broken bread,

629
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:24,730
you're not in my linkedin network.
Other people are, oh, you know what?

630
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,840
I'm expanding my business. I've got
a new role in sales. I've, you know,

631
00:38:28,841 --> 00:38:31,810
my own case, I'm going to book
this out. It's a lot wider.

632
00:38:31,811 --> 00:38:35,410
So if someone was to message
me on linkedin and said, hey,

633
00:38:35,411 --> 00:38:37,840
loved hearing your talk at
the University of Tampa,

634
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:41,500
like I was the one who asked this
question, I'm likely to connect with them.

635
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:47,590
It also makes it, when someone
says, can you make an introduction?

636
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:52,000
I see you're connected on Linkedin to this
person, can you make the introduction?

637
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:55,510
That's also where you need to understand
that they may not have the strongest

638
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:59,410
connection to people to make
an introduction. So I would
be able to say, oh yeah,

639
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:03,160
that person, I know them. We
connect it in Tampa for 10 minutes.

640
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:05,770
You can reach out and use my name,

641
00:39:05,771 --> 00:39:09,100
but I don't think I can be that meaningful
in terms of anything in depth, in a,

642
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:13,000
in a connection. But we use it
differently. And I think there's, that's,

643
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:17,110
you've hit on something in my mind
which is bigger, is that we don't,

644
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:22,060
when you have digital
tools around networks,

645
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:25,720
when we focus on the tools
themselves and the technology,

646
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,390
we forget that people
use them differently.

647
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:32,760
And we're just remember always
as human beings behind that. And,

648
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,910
and think about ways,

649
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:38,200
the way that you using something is not
necessarily the way somebody else uses

650
00:39:38,201 --> 00:39:41,650
it. And, and, and I would
say for anyone, you know,

651
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:46,570
you're in the room and anyone
watching, so on my website, Jay Kelly,

652
00:39:46,571 --> 00:39:51,370
hawaii.co, it's a.co, not a.com.
There's a little box that says,

653
00:39:51,371 --> 00:39:54,310
ask Kelly crazy thing comes to me,

654
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:59,920
comes into my Gmail account. Uh, there
is no one in between that. So if I,

655
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:04,000
if you don't get your question answered
today, just fire me the question.

656
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:07,190
Say that you were watching this and
you've got a question and I'll answer up.

657
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,710
Jay Kelly,
Jay Kelly,

658
00:40:08,711 --> 00:40:13,510
hawaii.co ask Kelly and Kelly answers.

659
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:17,920
Great. Thank you. I to build on
top of the previous question,

660
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,430
what other tools do you use
to keep track of fuel network?

661
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:25,420
Oftentimes I realized that I don't
remember if people verbal and in order for

662
00:40:25,421 --> 00:40:29,650
juniors, I think of this
problem of short memory and uh,

663
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,320
oftentimes I would find myself,

664
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:37,580
he there was this problem and I didn't
think of conducting this person and only

665
00:40:37,751 --> 00:40:41,570
two weeks later to realize he would
have solved this issue very quickly. Eh,

666
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:46,060
I wish I had like the magic solution for,

667
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:49,750
for remembering these
things. I am very, um,

668
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:55,300
I want to say geography based in my
thinking in terms of when I start problem

669
00:40:55,301 --> 00:40:58,630
solving. If I think of networking as it
gets the way you've just described it,

670
00:40:58,631 --> 00:41:02,050
like problem solving, who can
help me with this problem? Uh,

671
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:06,190
I'm often very geography or um,
company based.

672
00:41:06,191 --> 00:41:08,890
When I think of it sometimes I'm
like, okay, where did I meet them?

673
00:41:08,891 --> 00:41:11,800
Where did I meet them? And I have to
kind of like go down this waterfall.

674
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,170
I would say for anyone,

675
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:17,920
like figure out how you start to
problem solve in these situations.

676
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:19,443
Like who,

677
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:23,770
who have I met and then you'll probably
figure out what is the best way for you

678
00:41:23,771 --> 00:41:27,670
to organize your contacts.
Are you someone who would go to Linkedin?

679
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:31,960
Is a spreadsheet the answer for you,
is there some other,

680
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:36,400
yeah.
Is it groups on,

681
00:41:36,401 --> 00:41:40,360
you know on on a Google
plus like figure it out.

682
00:41:40,361 --> 00:41:42,280
Start to think about how you

683
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:48,290
problem solve and need the help of other
people and figure out van from there.

684
00:41:48,291 --> 00:41:51,680
Right. Where the ways I can clump people
in different things to be able to say,

685
00:41:51,681 --> 00:41:55,220
you know what, I just met this person
we talked to about this stuff. He might,

686
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:58,730
he or she may be a good person to ask
this type of question in the future.

687
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:02,960
Figure a way to tag them or do something.
But that part of,

688
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:05,660
I think maybe all of this with
the book and networking is,

689
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,540
is whole lot of self awareness,

690
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:13,970
a whole lot of self awareness about
how you operate within this world,

691
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:19,010
but how you reach out to other people
and how you can do that in a way that is

692
00:42:19,011 --> 00:42:22,340
more effective. But I mean, I
wish I had the ultimate dashboard.

693
00:42:22,341 --> 00:42:26,240
Maybe that's the next thing I
create. 2018. Yeah, there we go.

694
00:42:26,241 --> 00:42:28,460
Then we in August didn't have
enough projects to be all come on,

695
00:42:28,461 --> 00:42:30,200
come up with a dashboard because it is,

696
00:42:30,201 --> 00:42:34,040
it is something people are
always like where, where is
the, you know, the Rolodex,

697
00:42:34,041 --> 00:42:35,360
the CRM system.

698
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:36,650
Okay.

699
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:39,950
You know, I am not a spreadsheet person,
but if that's what works for you,

700
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:41,090
put it in a spreadsheet.

701
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:43,750
Okay.

702
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:46,180
And so great to have you here and um,

703
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:49,360
I hesitate to say if you want to leave
us with any parting wisdom because I

704
00:42:49,361 --> 00:42:51,460
think that's what the last
45 minutes was all about.

705
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:55,800
Any closing thoughts or final,
final remarks before we wrap?

706
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:59,650
I just want to say go forth and, you
know, be better human beings. So it's,

707
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:02,530
that's all that we all can
ask for. And I think, uh,

708
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:06,550
we understand that we're networking
with other people that their lives are

709
00:43:06,551 --> 00:43:07,960
complicated and messy.

710
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:12,990
If we can stop and observe and listen
a little bit more in our before we

711
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:19,740
interact, we will improve
our interactions. Thank
you. That's great. Kelly.

712
00:43:19,741 --> 00:43:21,810
It's been tight.
