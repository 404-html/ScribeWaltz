1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,700
So I'm absolutely delighted to have them
visit us today and talk to us a little

2
00:00:09,701 --> 00:00:13,880
bit about how she's managed to build
an unconventional company. Um, so,

3
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,070
so first and foremost,

4
00:00:15,071 --> 00:00:17,800
tell us a little bit about yourself
because you've got an impressive resume

5
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:19,120
resume,
um,

6
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:23,260
which goes from being a biologist
to various things and finally,

7
00:00:23,261 --> 00:00:25,900
entrepreneurship.
So tell us how that's all come about.

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,300
Okay. Um, Ooh, what do
I start? Okay. So, um,

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,270
I was born and raised in Minnesota.
Um,

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,190
I was one of those kids
that, um, love to get lost.

11
00:00:38,191 --> 00:00:40,430
So I was always wondering around,
uh,

12
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,040
my mom often tells me
the story of, um, how I,

13
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,740
I let myself out of the apartment that
we were staying at when I was, um,

14
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:50,850
I think that was one,

15
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:55,800
it was the middle of the winter and I
walked around the parking lot until child

16
00:00:55,801 --> 00:00:59,480
services came to pick me up. And so she
likes to tell me that story. And so I,

17
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,290
I link that to, um, kind
of to what I'm doing now.

18
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,630
I'm kind of a wander at heart.
Um,

19
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:11,310
after I left Minnesota, I was about eight
years old. I moved to North Carolina.

20
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,840
Um, and I got into biology
my freshman and sophomore,

21
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,470
junior year of college. And, um,

22
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,080
at the age of 19, I cloned a gene. Uh,

23
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:26,700
I was one of those like
nerdy kinds of kids.

24
00:01:26,701 --> 00:01:30,570
I was like crushing fruit flies
and just doing really weird things.

25
00:01:30,571 --> 00:01:35,571
And so that led me to traveling around
the state to talk about my research.

26
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:41,280
I also teamed up with my best friend
who did a lot of anti tobacco work,

27
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,690
um,
at the time.

28
00:01:42,691 --> 00:01:46,740
And we traveled around the country talking
to the young people about big tobacco

29
00:01:46,741 --> 00:01:51,450
and, and how to, how to, um, protect
ourselves against, against them.

30
00:01:51,451 --> 00:01:56,370
And so, um, after after
that I did some travel.

31
00:01:56,371 --> 00:02:00,780
I went and I moved to DC and moved to
San Francisco to organize churches or

32
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:04,500
pastors of those churches,
uh, in the Fillmore district,

33
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:09,210
which is the oldest black neighborhood
in San Francisco. And, um,

34
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,810
then I moved back to North
Carolina for my senior year.

35
00:02:12,811 --> 00:02:17,700
I had five years of university. I
stayed an extra year. Um, and, uh,

36
00:02:17,701 --> 00:02:21,120
I started an organization to help
open a civil rights museum. Um,

37
00:02:21,121 --> 00:02:25,770
it was a museum that, um, had had
been open for I think 14 years.

38
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,220
Come on in. I'm sorry. I definitely
put you on the spot. I'm sorry.

39
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,600
Um,
and so

40
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,970
my senior year, this
museum opened and, um,

41
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:42,110
I decided that I wanted to do something
a little bit different instead of

42
00:02:42,111 --> 00:02:45,080
traveling and living in
San Francisco and DC,

43
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:48,650
I wanted to try something
international. So, um,

44
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:53,950
I applied for this program and I got it
and I sold everything that I owned after

45
00:02:54,471 --> 00:02:56,780
I graduated college and I moved to India.

46
00:02:56,781 --> 00:03:00,610
So I was in India for
a little over a year.

47
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:05,440
I learned Hindi and, um, I lived on
a train for four portion of the year,

48
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:07,900
so I was just doing all of
these really interesting things.

49
00:03:07,901 --> 00:03:11,200
And I went to India with
braids similar to this.

50
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:13,960
And so as my,
uh,

51
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,830
diaspora folks know at some point
the brains have to come out.

52
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,870
So I took the braids out and I didn't
know what to do with my hair. Um,

53
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,620
uh, the hair of a lot of Indians
is very different from my own,

54
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:30,160
and I didn't have anything
to take care of it. So, uh,

55
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:33,910
my hair started breaking and I,
and I thought to myself, you know,

56
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:37,000
I don't see any people who looked like me.

57
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:42,001
I don't see any travelers or any x bats
who I can talk to about what's happening

58
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:47,080
with my hair. And so the idea
for travel noire was born there.

59
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,430
Um, but I sat on it for two
years. I traveled through Asia,

60
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:56,230
spent all of my money and ended up broke
back home in southern California at my

61
00:03:56,231 --> 00:03:59,680
mom's house. And so, um,
it's kind of troubling.

62
00:03:59,681 --> 00:04:01,300
More kind of started out of that.

63
00:04:01,301 --> 00:04:03,580
So it was a seed planted
while I was living in India.

64
00:04:03,581 --> 00:04:07,030
And then I kind of came back to the US.

65
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:11,140
My mom tried to get me into medicine as
again, all of my diasporic folks here,

66
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:15,470
you all know in our, in,
in, so I'm Nigerian. Um,

67
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:20,140
and for my mom it was either
you were either a doctor,

68
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:24,340
a lawyer, an engineer, or a failure.
Like anything else. There was another,

69
00:04:24,341 --> 00:04:27,190
there was this like little box
that you kind of had to fit in.

70
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,630
And so when I came home after
spending all my money traveling,

71
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,530
my mom was like, oh yeah, so
here's this a nursing program.

72
00:04:35,531 --> 00:04:38,500
Here is this doctor's program.
Here's this postbac program.

73
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,660
And after six months I was like,
all right, I love you mom, but, uh,

74
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:47,080
I'm going to move to San Francisco.
So I had $300 in my bank account.

75
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,220
And, uh, somebody offered a
couch for me in San Francisco.

76
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,100
I'm on treasure island. I don't know
if anybody's been to San Francisco,

77
00:04:54,101 --> 00:04:58,480
but there's this little island called
treasure island between San Francisco and

78
00:04:58,481 --> 00:05:01,150
Oakland if you're to cross the bay bridge.
So I lived there.

79
00:05:01,151 --> 00:05:06,151
I slept on a couch slash bed for
six months and I worked four jobs.

80
00:05:06,401 --> 00:05:10,480
And I had this like really interesting,
like I sold luxury sunglasses.

81
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:15,170
I was a nanny, which was very
short lived. And, um, I, uh,

82
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,670
helped my friend, senator, our
company, and, um, what else did I do?

83
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,920
Um,

84
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:24,580
and I was an intern at a startup company
and being an intern of that startup

85
00:05:24,581 --> 00:05:29,290
company was what kind of fine
tune this idea that I had,

86
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:34,420
um, for travel new are. So that is
a very long answer to your question,

87
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:38,330
but I hope it gives some background.
Absolutely. And you know,

88
00:05:38,331 --> 00:05:42,610
it sounds like you chose the favorite
option came to have Nigerian parents

89
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,550
wanted,
hence you funding travel traveling well,

90
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:48,760
but tell us a little bit about what travel
and why it actually is when it does.

91
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,760
Yeah. And who you talk to.
Woody Allen says. Sure.

92
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:55,160
So started traveling to war in 2013.
Um,

93
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:58,250
and this was after,
you know,

94
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:03,140
not seeing travelers who look like me.
If you go to any store,

95
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:07,010
you pull any travel magazine off the,
off the stands,

96
00:06:07,011 --> 00:06:09,410
you'll never see somebody
who looks like me.

97
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:13,580
You'll never see a black girl in
Italy or in, you know, whatever.

98
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,060
And what that meant for a lot of people
was if they didn't see somebody who

99
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:19,730
looked like them traveling and
all these different places,

100
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,620
they then thought that it might have
been dangerous for them to travel or that

101
00:06:24,621 --> 00:06:25,970
travel might not be for them,

102
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:29,810
or that travel is only for the rich
and famous like Beyonce and Jay z or

103
00:06:29,811 --> 00:06:34,790
whatever. And so I wanted to bring
that down to earth. I mean, I was,

104
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:35,960
when I was living in India,

105
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:40,670
I was flying on Air Asia for $8
to Malaysia from India. I mean,

106
00:06:40,671 --> 00:06:44,660
it was crazy. And so I wanted
people to, um, to know this.

107
00:06:44,661 --> 00:06:48,040
And so traveling was started out as,
um,

108
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:49,700
an editorial site.

109
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:53,510
So we had about a hundred writers who
lived all over the globe who shared their

110
00:06:53,511 --> 00:06:57,190
love of travel and what it was
like being a person of color. Um,

111
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:02,220
while they traveled. I remember
being in, um, I think I was in, uh,

112
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,130
the Netherlands and somebody
asked me, they said, well,

113
00:07:04,131 --> 00:07:07,100
what's the difference between a black
person traveling or black American

114
00:07:07,101 --> 00:07:10,940
traveling and a white American
traveling? And I, I told him,

115
00:07:10,941 --> 00:07:15,170
I gave him a couple of examples,
but one that stood out was in China.

116
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:19,110
Um, when I would go into a
store and I'd ask her for, um,

117
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,180
facewash they'd give me skin whitening
cream or a kid would come and try to rub

118
00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:26,540
off my skin thinking it was dirt
and there was like white, white,

119
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:31,080
white underneath or people who would
constantly pull my hair or, um,

120
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,820
there were all of these
different experiences that
were very unique to a certain

121
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:37,460
subset of people that
nobody was talking about.

122
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:42,500
So we started out as an editorial site
and then we grew from that to hosting

123
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:47,030
live classes about how to get your boss
to let you work from anywhere in the

124
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:51,950
world or how to get paid to travel. And
we started building an audience that way.

125
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:56,870
And one thing that I learned that we did,
we didn't make money for 18 months,

126
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,700
so 18 months.

127
00:07:58,701 --> 00:08:03,701
We spent the time building an audience
and we just offered a lot of free things,

128
00:08:04,341 --> 00:08:08,390
a lot of free classes. Um, and when
we did end up selling a product,

129
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,230
we sold out of it.
And so we started as an editorial site.

130
00:08:12,231 --> 00:08:14,950
We started doing a lot of free
things and then we launched, um,

131
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:18,170
traveling to our experiences
in July of 2015, uh,

132
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,880
travel noire experiences their small
group experiences, about 14 people there,

133
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:24,320
14 strangers from anywhere in the world.

134
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:27,410
They meet in one of
our seven destinations,

135
00:08:27,411 --> 00:08:31,820
and we take them for the ride of
their life. Um, it was inspired.

136
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:34,970
Um,
it was inspired by my time in India.

137
00:08:34,971 --> 00:08:38,870
It was my time in India was awesome,
but it was also like very challenging.

138
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:41,090
Who in here has been to India?
All right.

139
00:08:41,091 --> 00:08:45,950
So y'all know that India is not people.
Some people used to tell me,

140
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,671
oh,
like Indians,

141
00:08:46,671 --> 00:08:50,090
like traveling to like any other Asian
country or it's like traveling to any

142
00:08:50,091 --> 00:08:54,710
other country. Um, and it's not, it's like
very difficult. It's very challenging.

143
00:08:54,711 --> 00:08:58,680
You either love it or you hate it.
And I thought to myself,

144
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,700
if India had not been so challenging,
I would not have,

145
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,230
have grown so much or been so transformed
by it. And so I thought to myself,

146
00:09:07,231 --> 00:09:12,231
how can I compress that into seven days
where you challenge people enough that

147
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:16,920
you know, they don't hate you, right?
Cause it's a vacation. But you also, um,

148
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:20,310
build in moments of transformation.

149
00:09:20,311 --> 00:09:25,080
So on any one of our trips,
you'll find days that challenge these,

150
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:29,520
that lifts you up days that may make you
upset. Like in Cape Town for instance,

151
00:09:29,521 --> 00:09:33,140
we talk a lot about apartheid in Jo'Burg,
we talk a lot about apartheid. Um,

152
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,390
and we go in and talk to people and we
go into people's homes and we cook with

153
00:09:36,391 --> 00:09:40,050
them. And so the, the idea
behind those experiences,

154
00:09:40,051 --> 00:09:42,150
it is that they are an experience.

155
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:47,710
It's like you're living just like a logo,
which isn't easy in a lot of places. Um,

156
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,620
and so we launched tn experiences.

157
00:09:49,621 --> 00:09:53,510
We run about 60 trips a year
across five continents. Um,

158
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,250
each trip comes with a
private photographer. Um,

159
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,360
and that's because I didn't want people
to look through travel through their

160
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:01,021
phone.
Right?

161
00:10:01,021 --> 00:10:05,520
I wanted people to be present and I wanted
people to really enjoy the moment and

162
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:09,780
enjoy conversations and not try and
Graham everything or a snapchat,

163
00:10:09,781 --> 00:10:12,670
everything, uh, or tweet things. Um,

164
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,320
and so those are the experiences I
typically seven days, eight nights,

165
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,940
seven days, six nights. Um, and then
we launched compass earlier this year,

166
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,880
which is a platform that
helps travelers travel better.

167
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:27,990
So if you want to move abroad,
if you want to travel solo,

168
00:10:27,991 --> 00:10:30,810
if you want to move your family abroad,

169
00:10:30,811 --> 00:10:34,020
we have resources that we deliver
every single week to help you do that.

170
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:38,960
So that's what traveling war is in.
I always tell everything in the story,

171
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:42,780
just, just so you know. So sometimes
the answers are very long, um,

172
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,240
but they're with me or whatever.

173
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,920
Then so that step off to,
you know,

174
00:10:49,921 --> 00:10:53,340
towards being an entrepreneur is obviously
one that some people are that I'm

175
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:56,430
nervous about. How did you
find it? Like what was it,

176
00:10:56,431 --> 00:10:59,610
what emotions did you go through when you
were making that decision and actually

177
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,530
deciding that this was going
to be for you? Um, well, the
decision was made for me.

178
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,560
I didn't make the decision. Um, so, uh,

179
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,480
two days before my birthday actually,
my boss sent me an email,

180
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,140
a firing me, um, and this was

181
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,680
so was two days of my birthday.
Um,

182
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:24,740
and I think two weeks before
like a vacation that I was
supposed to take and um,

183
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:30,060
that kind of forced my hand, you
know, because I didn't, I wasn't,

184
00:11:30,061 --> 00:11:32,960
I was planning on leaving a couple
of months later, but it was a,

185
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:37,770
it was such a blessing because had I left
a couple months later on my own terms,

186
00:11:37,771 --> 00:11:41,310
I wouldn't have gotten like the
severance, but she, since she fired me,

187
00:11:41,311 --> 00:11:44,100
I was able to keep that severance,
which went into this,

188
00:11:44,101 --> 00:11:48,250
this pocket of mine to help me kind of
live for the next 18 months that travel

189
00:11:48,251 --> 00:11:52,440
noire didn't make any
money. Um, and so when,

190
00:11:52,441 --> 00:11:57,441
so entrepreneurship I would say is
probably like the hardest thing I've ever

191
00:11:58,841 --> 00:12:02,740
done. Anybody who is an
entrepreneur who has been,

192
00:12:02,741 --> 00:12:05,200
we'll probably say the very same things.
I mean,

193
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,440
just last couple of months ago I was like,
you know,

194
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,670
like what if I just like give it all
up and like just buy a little house in

195
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:17,170
Italy with no Internet, no electricity,
and just look at the water.

196
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:21,970
I'll be fine. I'll be quiet. I live a nice
quiet existence. Every entrepreneur has,

197
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:27,060
has talked like that with themselves and
it's a matter of really understanding

198
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:32,260
your mission and what you are
called to do in this world.

199
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:37,120
And it's just hard. It's hard. Like it's,
it's not easy. Like I, we have a team,

200
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:40,000
I have a team of full time
folks with eight, eight people,

201
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:44,140
but you count all of our contractors
in and that brings it up to 30 and just

202
00:12:44,141 --> 00:12:45,110
managing your,
like you,

203
00:12:45,111 --> 00:12:49,420
you're holding these people's
lives in your hand and you know,

204
00:12:49,421 --> 00:12:54,421
every move that you make it like
their livelihood depends on it.

205
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:59,350
And that pressure of having to figure out,
you know,

206
00:12:59,351 --> 00:13:01,300
whether or not you have
this really great idea,

207
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:03,790
but it's not financially feasible,
but you want to do it.

208
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:07,030
You can't do it because you have these,
you have the livelihoods.

209
00:13:07,031 --> 00:13:09,760
Of these people in your hands,
people who have families,

210
00:13:09,761 --> 00:13:13,120
people who are considering proposing
to their significant others, you know,

211
00:13:13,121 --> 00:13:17,170
you have all of these different things.
And so it's, it's been a challenge,

212
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,970
but it's also pretty
beautiful. I mean, you,

213
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:22,740
you build something out
of the dust and it's, um,

214
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:26,710
one of the things that I thought was
really cool last year in January,

215
00:13:26,711 --> 00:13:29,760
we had a team of four people and,
um,

216
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,760
got a tweet one morning in
January that we had been named by,

217
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:39,580
by fast company as one of
the most innovative companies
in the world. And, um,

218
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,660
it was, it was kind of mind blowing
because we were such a small team,

219
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:47,950
but it was kind of validating too that,
you know,

220
00:13:47,951 --> 00:13:52,750
anybody with an idea that has a
pension towards execution, um,

221
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:56,230
can really do some good in the world.
And so that's what I've,

222
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,900
I've learned about entrepreneur.

223
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:00,610
There's a lot that I've learned about
entrepot I could talk about all day, but,

224
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:05,080
um, it's really hard. And I tell
people, people ask me what their, uh,

225
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:08,080
advices for,
for wanting to be entrepreneurs.

226
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:12,460
And a lot of times I tell them not to
do it. And I know that's really bad,

227
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,320
but it really is hard.

228
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:18,190
And when you think about entrepreneurs
that are charismatic specifically,

229
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,210
they have, um, I or rate
of depression, right?

230
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:27,100
And they have like, you know, being
a charismatic entrepreneur who,

231
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,070
who are you going to talk to
you when things go wrong, right?

232
00:14:30,071 --> 00:14:31,930
Like if you have a significant other,
perfect.

233
00:14:31,931 --> 00:14:36,670
But are there people around
you that really understand
the perils and the plight

234
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,290
of being an entrepreneur?

235
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:42,100
And I know it's hard to like put into
words for people who aren't entrepreneurs,

236
00:14:42,101 --> 00:14:45,790
but, um, sometimes it can get really
challenging, but it's also beautiful.

237
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:49,810
So there's a, there's a balance, right?
So just to pick up on your point around,

238
00:14:49,811 --> 00:14:51,890
you know,
needing to have other people to talk to,

239
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:56,690
who have your mentors been over your
journey with traveling while, yeah. So,

240
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:02,000
um, I have a group of advisors, they all
come from different walks of life. Um,

241
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,830
but I also have,
um,

242
00:15:03,831 --> 00:15:08,831
a group of entrepreneurs that I meet
with maybe four or five times a year.

243
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,160
Um,

244
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,160
these are entrepreneurs from all over the
world and we all come together to talk

245
00:15:15,471 --> 00:15:17,870
about issues and what we're going through.

246
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,630
And one thing that I've learned is
that no matter how much money you make,

247
00:15:20,631 --> 00:15:23,480
you're still, you're still messed up.
Like everybody's still has problems.

248
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,800
Everybody has problems.

249
00:15:24,801 --> 00:15:29,330
You think when you get into a room with
somebody who has a $200 million company

250
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:32,330
that they're just going to
be like relaxing and Maxon,

251
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:35,450
but it's just the problem's
magnified on a different,

252
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,020
on a different scale and
a different level. Um,

253
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:41,750
and so that's one thing that I've learned
is that problem that your problems

254
00:15:41,751 --> 00:15:44,600
don't go away or you know, money.
I mean, they just, they're,

255
00:15:44,601 --> 00:15:47,750
they're still there just in
different ways. Yeah. Cool.

256
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,830
And congratulations on being
named on a excuse. She ended
30. Thank you. Thank you.

257
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:56,210
Subsea fantastic from last year.
So apart from that particular highlight,

258
00:15:56,211 --> 00:16:00,770
one of the highs of you had,
um,

259
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,710
other HIEs.
Uh,

260
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:08,150
I would say having a team of
really cool people, um, you know,

261
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,120
it's always great when you're able to
work with people that you get along with.

262
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:16,130
And people who are just a lot of fun,
um,

263
00:16:16,131 --> 00:16:18,980
who are grounded in the same
mission that you're grounded in.

264
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:23,900
I can take a month off and not have to
worry about anything because they handle

265
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:28,670
everything. Um, and so I think that that's
been the biggest blessing, uh, launch,

266
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:33,650
launching compass this year has
also been a big blessing. Um,

267
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,570
I'm trying to think. There've
been so many highs, but I,

268
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:40,760
I tell my team not to get caught
up on all of them. Right. And, um,

269
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:44,630
so while we do celebrate, you
know, what we've got going on,

270
00:16:44,631 --> 00:16:48,350
we are also still very rooted in the
work that we have to do because they have

271
00:16:48,351 --> 00:16:50,270
more people to reach and we have more,
you know,

272
00:16:50,271 --> 00:16:54,830
we have more people that we want more
people whose lives we want to help

273
00:16:54,831 --> 00:16:58,510
transform. And so we do
celebrate the wins, but then we,

274
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:03,170
we go back and we, we, we dive into,
to the work that we have to do.

275
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,400
Yeah.

276
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,910
And you have hundreds of thousands of
followers on social media at the moment.

277
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,200
Um, so what role has digital actually
played and helping build your brand?

278
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,280
Huge. I mean, I, you talk
about millennials today and,

279
00:17:18,281 --> 00:17:22,370
and how much our lives are kind of
intertwined with social media. Um,

280
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,990
I remember it was the first starting
at the travel to our Instagram account.

281
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:31,910
It was so hard to find black
travelers. Like I, I would,

282
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:36,970
I would sit and browse on Instagram for
hours to find one photo and we would

283
00:17:37,371 --> 00:17:41,630
post 12 photos a day. So if you can
imagine like it just took, it was,

284
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,880
it was a lot of,
a lot of hard work,

285
00:17:43,881 --> 00:17:48,140
but over time and that easier people
like seeing themselves featured in,

286
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,260
in different places.

287
00:17:49,261 --> 00:17:53,670
So that made it easier for people to kind
of tag their photos. And so it's been,

288
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,890
it's been such a great help.
In fact,

289
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:59,400
people when they tell me they've heard
of and water the first place that they

290
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,320
say that they've heard of
travel north Instagram.

291
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:04,830
And so we use Instagram as
like the top of the funnel.

292
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:09,540
And so a lot of times when
we need somebody to do
something and we have a call

293
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:13,370
to action, we start on Instagram
or we start an email. Um,

294
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,680
and we direct people where we want to go,
which has been really,

295
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:17,910
which has been really cool.

296
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:22,560
And I'm sort of back to more your
travel and personal experiences.

297
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:24,420
What's the craziest place
you've ever visited?

298
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,970
The craziest place I've ever visited.
Um,

299
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,340
probably India. I will always say
India for any, any crazy adventure.

300
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:40,680
Um, crazy, craziest place I visited. So,

301
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,770
uh, my boyfriend and I, um,

302
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:47,670
he came to India while I
was living there and we, uh,

303
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:52,640
took a bus like a four by four
up to Kashmir, which is, uh,

304
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:57,120
the disputed a territory of India,

305
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:00,510
India and Pakistan. And um,
it was so beautiful though.

306
00:19:00,511 --> 00:19:02,430
It was so beautiful,

307
00:19:02,431 --> 00:19:06,270
but it was quite treacherous getting
there and we had to sit in the,

308
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,730
it wasn't the trunk,
but it was like,

309
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,120
if you imagine like a jeep
and you'd have the chair,

310
00:19:12,121 --> 00:19:15,570
you have the drivers see in the passenger
seat and then you have like another

311
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:19,710
row of seats. We were in the back, like
where there were no seats, just the floor.

312
00:19:19,711 --> 00:19:23,970
So we were just sitting in the
back looking at the outside and we,

313
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,600
um, we rode on this, um,

314
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:32,070
this canyon with no fence,
but it was just like,

315
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:36,750
it was the craziest thing. It was
the craziest adventure. People die,

316
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:40,560
people die on that road.
Um, and uh, you know,

317
00:19:40,561 --> 00:19:42,820
we got stopped by,
um,

318
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:48,050
they're either cows or goats that were
crossing and it caused the whole traffic

319
00:19:48,091 --> 00:19:52,440
jam. And, um, for those that
have been to India, you know,

320
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:57,120
how cows do, they just do whatever
they do and everybody just stops. So,

321
00:19:57,121 --> 00:19:59,640
you know, but it was
cool. It was fun. Right.

322
00:19:59,641 --> 00:20:02,700
I'm just going to open it up to the
audience to see if anyone has got any

323
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,600
questions for them.

324
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,230
You've got to Mike,
so

325
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,733
thank you.

326
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:13,470
Thanks so much again,

327
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,520
my love the way that you want to
have questions and stories. Um,

328
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,320
so I was just wondering what you think,
what you know now,

329
00:20:20,321 --> 00:20:23,470
what would you have told yourself when
you first decided to start traveling?

330
00:20:23,471 --> 00:20:24,304
You are,

331
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,940
that's a good question.

332
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,210
MMM.

333
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,760
Back then.

334
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:36,523
Hmm,

335
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:42,340
I'd probably say have a closer
relationship with God. Um,

336
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:46,750
and I think that, so when, when I
first started traveling new, our,

337
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,480
I had like a team, but it was a t
because we didn't make any money.

338
00:20:51,481 --> 00:20:53,110
We couldn't afford to pay anybody.

339
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:58,420
And I think that the way that I treated
people back then, I went, it wasn't bad.

340
00:20:58,421 --> 00:20:58,871
Like I,
you know,

341
00:20:58,871 --> 00:21:02,800
I wasn't yelling at people or kicking
them or doing anything like that.

342
00:21:02,801 --> 00:21:06,040
But I think that what I
think that, that, you know,

343
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:09,430
had I had a closer and
tighter relationship with God,

344
00:21:09,431 --> 00:21:14,290
I would have been much calmer.
I would have been nicer to people.

345
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:19,330
Um, and so I think that's
probably one of the big things,

346
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:24,100
um, because I had a team fallout
before we hired a new team.

347
00:21:24,101 --> 00:21:28,690
So if you can imagine running a company
and then she leaves your team and then

348
00:21:28,691 --> 00:21:30,760
you have to kind of have to start over.
Um,

349
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,360
and then another thing that I
would say would probably be,

350
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,330
um,
I dunno,

351
00:21:40,331 --> 00:21:44,590
like sometimes people sometimes,
because we're not out there,

352
00:21:44,591 --> 00:21:48,460
like we're not hosting a lot of
events and we're not, um, you know,

353
00:21:48,461 --> 00:21:50,230
we're not at every event.

354
00:21:50,231 --> 00:21:54,850
People kind of see us as standoffish
or a little like secretive or you know,

355
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:58,720
whatever. And it's, it's not, it's
not the case. And I, and I, it's,

356
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:02,620
I guess it's maybe it's just like the
ethic or the or the ethics or the drive.

357
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:06,970
Uh, we just love our work and we love
doing good work and sometimes we just get

358
00:22:06,971 --> 00:22:08,740
consumed in doing that good work,

359
00:22:08,741 --> 00:22:12,820
but not being afraid to like pick out
of the curtain every once in a while and

360
00:22:12,821 --> 00:22:15,040
say what's up to folks. So, yeah.

361
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,720
How did you find your team
when you were still smell?

362
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:25,960
Um,
so I think everybody,

363
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:30,990
everybody for the most part has been
really intrigued with this idea from about

364
00:22:31,691 --> 00:22:34,970
like working for, from anywhere or
working for a travel company or, you know,

365
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:39,820
we have unlimited vacations and you
don't have an office. And so, um,

366
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:42,970
obviously we couldn't
pay people back then,

367
00:22:42,971 --> 00:22:46,090
so this is so before we could pay people.
Um,

368
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,240
I think people would just really attracted
to the brand and the culture of the

369
00:22:49,241 --> 00:22:50,710
brand.
Um,

370
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:55,550
and people want it to be associated
with what we were doing. Um,

371
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:57,100
so it was,

372
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,360
it wasn't difficult to find a team.

373
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:04,670
I mean it's always difficult to find
like a quality quality team. Um,

374
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:09,690
but it wasn't challenging to find people
who love travel because back then there

375
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:13,270
not that there was a small subset
of black folks trap traveling.

376
00:23:13,271 --> 00:23:15,670
There were a ton, but we
weren't all connected. And I,

377
00:23:15,671 --> 00:23:18,700
and I think once people found that nexus,

378
00:23:18,701 --> 00:23:20,950
they kind of wanted to
gravitate towards it.

379
00:23:20,951 --> 00:23:25,240
So some people were like old friends
that I brought into this project and some

380
00:23:25,241 --> 00:23:28,420
people, if you had a fellowship
program and the fellowship program,

381
00:23:28,421 --> 00:23:32,560
I taught you how to earn enough miles for
a free vacation anywhere you wanted in

382
00:23:32,561 --> 00:23:37,060
the world. And a lot of people
were like, oh shoot. Okay.

383
00:23:37,061 --> 00:23:38,830
Like you're not paying
me, but you're, you're,

384
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:43,330
you're showing me how to travel for free.

385
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,130
And that's like the next best

386
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:50,850
of all your work on Instagram. Amazing.
So that's one of the people who found it.

387
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:56,200
Okay. Um, so I'm going to
talk about building of culture
and um, that's, you know,

388
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:59,450
previously swat for us set up and
that's one of the biggest, um,

389
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,500
I guess like studying,
it's pretty tough to do it.

390
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:07,450
How did you go about sort of building
culture and especially from Instagram sort

391
00:24:07,451 --> 00:24:09,430
of getting the follow up
base because you know,

392
00:24:09,431 --> 00:24:13,320
you've got lots of travelers that you
sort of connected in there and sort of,

393
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:17,650
I guess you predicted a group of travelers
all over the world or an Instagram

394
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,370
post travels through that trouble anymore.

395
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:26,170
So how do you go about doing that and
just sort of creating this community? Um,

396
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,010
and then my second question was about the
locations that you have already listed.

397
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:34,770
How do you go about selecting those and
sort of organizing the experiences? Um,

398
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:38,010
for one eight, you didn't,
Cape Town and most experiences,

399
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:41,980
you see this as very touristy because
you don't learn about sort of the history

400
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,470
and what's going on in the actual,
people will leave there.

401
00:24:44,471 --> 00:24:46,120
So how did you go about just so creative?

402
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:50,700
I have a very short term memory,
so I'm going to try,

403
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:52,340
I'm going to try and
remember both of them. Okay.

404
00:24:52,341 --> 00:24:55,400
So the first question is
how do we build culture? Um,

405
00:24:56,030 --> 00:25:00,740
culture wasn't, extension is an
extension of who we are as a team.

406
00:25:00,741 --> 00:25:04,790
So right when I had that team fall off,
we had like two people that stayed.

407
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:08,380
And so what I did was I said,
all right, we got a bit,

408
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:09,740
we had to build a tighter culture.

409
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:12,980
So we had a summer culture
project and we worked,

410
00:25:12,981 --> 00:25:16,970
we had I think a Friday all hands
on deck for like two months.

411
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:21,200
And we built out the entire culture. We
build art, we want unlimited vacations,

412
00:25:21,201 --> 00:25:24,410
we want, um, we want to be
able to work from anywhere.

413
00:25:24,411 --> 00:25:26,750
I feel like now if I went back to
my team and said, all right, y'all,

414
00:25:26,751 --> 00:25:30,020
we're gonna put an office in Chicago,
they would like revolt. They, they,

415
00:25:30,021 --> 00:25:34,490
they really love being able
to work from anywhere. Um,

416
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,890
we, you know, we pay
their cell phone bills,

417
00:25:36,891 --> 00:25:41,510
like we have all of these different
things that we do to make it easy to,

418
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:45,680
um, work for travel in New
Orleans. So our culture is,

419
00:25:45,681 --> 00:25:47,390
was an extension of who we are.

420
00:25:47,391 --> 00:25:50,510
So everything is figureoutable
is one of our tenets.

421
00:25:50,511 --> 00:25:55,511
And that just means that if I can't find,

422
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,920
like I can probably tell
I slipped this chair over,

423
00:25:57,921 --> 00:26:01,250
even if it doesn't have a name on it,
there is,

424
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:05,300
I will find out who made
this chair some way somehow.

425
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,460
And that's one of the
cultures of the team.

426
00:26:07,461 --> 00:26:11,540
That's one of the tenants for our culture
of the team is that if we can't find a

427
00:26:11,541 --> 00:26:15,030
solution right away, we,
we figure it out. Um,

428
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:19,280
and so every time we, uh,
are considering candidates,

429
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:24,260
we run them through a really
interesting, um, questionnaire. And it's,

430
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,820
I don't know if it's similar,

431
00:26:25,821 --> 00:26:28,970
like y'all Google used to have
something where they, it was like, Huh,

432
00:26:28,971 --> 00:26:31,670
so how many pennies are in
the empire state building?

433
00:26:31,671 --> 00:26:33,530
Or like something like that.
We got rid of those. But yeah.

434
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,440
So you got rid of those questions.
We actually have that.

435
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:41,420
We have the pennies question
in our, and one of our um, um,

436
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:46,110
forms because it goes
back to that everything is
figureoutable value instead of

437
00:26:46,111 --> 00:26:49,590
telling me what the number
is for that particular,

438
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,200
like how many pennies are
in empire state building.

439
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:55,650
You can ask me questions like,
is there furniture in the,

440
00:26:55,651 --> 00:26:59,700
is it furniture in the lobby? How many
people are there? Is, you know, is this,

441
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:04,260
are the coins? Um, like from the UK,

442
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:07,110
are they American pennies?
Like whatever. Um,

443
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:12,120
it allows us to see who people are
without them telling us who they are,

444
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:16,770
if that makes sense. Um, so we
also have one of our values is,

445
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:21,480
um, uh, be you stayed true.

446
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,340
Um, everybody on our team is weird.
Like the weirdest people that I know.

447
00:27:26,341 --> 00:27:30,560
And I'm also weird, but I want
people who come into the travel,

448
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:33,420
our team to also feel
like they are welcoming.

449
00:27:33,421 --> 00:27:36,420
They're weird and it's okay to be
weird because we're all weird. Okay.

450
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:39,390
So that's Kinda,
so we have kind of like,

451
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:42,290
it's like a very kind of
like a familial vibe. It's,

452
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:47,320
it's kind of like almost how I would
imagine Google was back in 90 back in

453
00:27:48,141 --> 00:27:49,520
[inaudible] 98.
Um,

454
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:54,660
and so has the culture question
for the destination questions.

455
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,550
Um, sometimes we choose places based on
where I've been or where some of my staff

456
00:27:59,551 --> 00:28:03,420
has been. Um, and then we go
there, we travel there and we,

457
00:28:03,421 --> 00:28:07,590
I remember going to Cape Town
who's been to Cape Town. All right.

458
00:28:07,591 --> 00:28:10,920
So we've got folks who have been to Cape
Town. Um, so when I landed in Cape Town,

459
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:14,730
I wanted to, to build an
experience that I could relate to,

460
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:19,200
which was a black Cape Town experience.
Um, but when I landed in Cape Town,

461
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:23,730
um, I sit in camps bay. I don't know
if y'all are familiar with camps bay,

462
00:28:23,731 --> 00:28:24,660
but it's like near the,

463
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:28,740
near the water near the ocean and the
only people of color that I saw where the

464
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:31,500
help. Um, and I was like, hmm.

465
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,100
So in order to build an
experience that I can relate to,

466
00:28:35,101 --> 00:28:38,430
I have to find people who look like me.
And so I was,

467
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,190
I was racking my brain trying to
figure out how to build the Cape Town

468
00:28:41,191 --> 00:28:45,750
experience. That was one that focus
on culture, meeting people. Um,

469
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,460
and so I ended up
figuring it out. And, um,

470
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:54,300
I remember we were at a point where we
were trying to figure out whether to

471
00:28:54,301 --> 00:28:57,270
include Robben Island, um, in the tour.

472
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:01,110
And I talked to one of the
guys who grew up in long ago,

473
00:29:01,111 --> 00:29:04,680
which is a township outside of
Cape Town. And I said, you know,

474
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,900
I'm kind of torn between
this, between um, uh,

475
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,220
Robben Island and the district six museum.

476
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:16,640
And we landed on having those stories
told by the people who live them

477
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,630
themselves in the township.
Um,

478
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,800
and so we encourage people on their free
day if they want to go to Robben Island

479
00:29:22,801 --> 00:29:24,310
to go there. But, um,

480
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:28,170
the guards and Robben Island don't even
like giving the tours there because it

481
00:29:28,171 --> 00:29:32,400
reminds, these are former prisoners
who spent their lives in this,

482
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:36,270
in this prison, and they're now forest
because they have to make a living.

483
00:29:36,271 --> 00:29:39,720
Nobody will hire them to retell the
story that were so painful for them.

484
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,750
And so when building that experience
and all of our experiences,

485
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:48,280
really, we have to be very
sensitive to all of these things.

486
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:53,050
So people are paying for that sensitivity,

487
00:29:53,051 --> 00:29:56,170
if you will. Right. So understanding
the issues as they exist.

488
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:00,370
People still go to Robben Island and they
find out for themselves, just like in,

489
00:30:00,371 --> 00:30:04,630
um, Bali we haven't experienced in
Bali. People go to the elephant. Um,

490
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,810
they're not elephant farms,
but they're like the elephant.

491
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,500
I'm not sanctuaries with the elephant
places. I don't know what they're called,

492
00:30:11,501 --> 00:30:14,860
but people go there and then
they'd come back sad, right?

493
00:30:14,861 --> 00:30:19,000
Like they realize for themselves that
this wasn't like this wasn't what I

494
00:30:19,001 --> 00:30:21,310
expected.
But we get a lot of questions like,

495
00:30:21,311 --> 00:30:24,560
why don't you include like an elephant
tour? Like why don't you do x?

496
00:30:24,561 --> 00:30:25,480
So why don't you do y?

497
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:30,750
And it's our job to be mindful and to be
sensitive to how the locals really live

498
00:30:31,001 --> 00:30:36,001
their lives and how to create a
space where we're only working with,

499
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:40,090
um, local vendors. We're building
up economies and things like that.

500
00:30:40,091 --> 00:30:44,800
So a part of it,
the mantra is om travel to meet people,

501
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:49,210
not see things. Right. So traveling
to have conversations with people.

502
00:30:49,211 --> 00:30:52,930
Sometimes I know when I try,
when I've traveled in the past,

503
00:30:52,931 --> 00:30:57,040
I would go to like monuments and like
take pictures. But at the end of the day,

504
00:30:57,041 --> 00:31:00,700
what I really remembered about the trip
for the people that I met and the homes

505
00:31:00,701 --> 00:31:02,650
that people were invited me
into and the coffee shops,

506
00:31:02,651 --> 00:31:04,420
we sat and talked and whatever.

507
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:09,190
And so that's kind of the philosophy
that we use to build those experiences.

508
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,450
Yeah,
you're welcome.

509
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:16,820
So I have a questions around money.
It's one question

510
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,310
pop up.

511
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:24,310
So like how can I make someone transition
from employment to entrepreneurship?

512
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:31,310
Because, see, when union payment, you'll
be feeded and at least honesty, CPD.

513
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:32,810
So if you decide,
you know what,

514
00:31:32,811 --> 00:31:36,300
I'm just going to follow my dream and
you need to be able to generate revenue

515
00:31:36,301 --> 00:31:39,730
because at the end of the year or human
being, you need a roof, need to eat.

516
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:44,570
He tells me everything. So, and you don't
know how long that business is way to,

517
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:48,130
you know, uh, how long have you sensed
it would take to go to [inaudible] team,

518
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:50,420
the current standards of
living that you have now.

519
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:53,330
So like that's something that I think,
and then again,

520
00:31:53,331 --> 00:31:57,590
the question of passion and also being,
maybe they saw the right word to use,

521
00:31:57,591 --> 00:32:01,040
but realistic. So like I'm passionate
about this idea by the end of the day,

522
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:05,350
do you got bills to pay? Right?
So, so how do you like, you know,

523
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,340
how do you like is cause that's,
that's,

524
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,450
that's a conversation I need to have
yourself, right? For sure. So how,

525
00:32:11,451 --> 00:32:14,240
how do you go about that? This,
this, of this whole money thing.

526
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,700
And maybe the type question would be,

527
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:19,190
how do you know this is
the right and to stop?

528
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,730
Maybe you have a nice idea you're working
on in, but the money's not coming in.

529
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,230
So,
yeah.

530
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:27,780
All right. I, Gosh, I
got to short. Okay. Okay.

531
00:32:27,781 --> 00:32:31,230
So first question was,
um,

532
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:36,110
the first question was, I know
what you're getting at. Okay.

533
00:32:36,111 --> 00:32:40,040
So incident when I was living
in San Francisco, after I
spent my money traveling,

534
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,420
I live with my mom for six months.

535
00:32:41,421 --> 00:32:44,390
I moved to San Francisco
and I had all those jobs.

536
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,790
I had a $3 a day budget.

537
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:51,850
So it was either I use that $3 for
the bus or I use it to eat food.

538
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:55,580
And with any startup,
well not any startup,

539
00:32:55,581 --> 00:32:57,290
but a lot of startups in San Francisco,

540
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,450
they had free food just
like I'll do it Google.

541
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:04,250
So I was able to kind of offset that.
But $3 a day isn't that a lot,

542
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,410
you know, um, at all.

543
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:10,790
And so that was the budget that I had
for six months. So when you think about,

544
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:13,340
and not every entrepreneur's
journey is like that,

545
00:33:13,341 --> 00:33:16,100
but a good number of folks,

546
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,440
when they leave their high paying jobs,

547
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:21,320
you maintaining that standard of living,

548
00:33:21,321 --> 00:33:26,321
you have to reconcile that because if
you're making six figures and you are

549
00:33:26,331 --> 00:33:30,680
trying to start a company that is making
$0 million and 0 million cents, um,

550
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:34,850
if you quit your job, then you're,
you're, you're not, it's not,

551
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:39,770
it's just not going. The numbers aren't
going shake out. So I had to, I remember,

552
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:44,240
uh, after I got fired from my job, those
checks stop coming. But I had saved,

553
00:33:44,241 --> 00:33:49,220
I think I saved maybe like $15,000
or something, but that was the,

554
00:33:49,221 --> 00:33:52,850
for the next 18 months that I had
to live like $15,000 for 18 months.

555
00:33:52,851 --> 00:33:54,170
That's like,
that's not a lot of money.

556
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,440
And so I had to move out of my apartment
and I was living in San Francisco.

557
00:33:57,441 --> 00:34:01,490
I moved out of my apartment and I
just traveled for six months. And so,

558
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:02,721
you know,

559
00:34:02,721 --> 00:34:07,721
there are lots of different ways that you
have to reconcile what your passion is

560
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,350
and your current standard of living.
And how comfortable you are.

561
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:15,590
You have to be comfortable with
being uncomfortable. Otherwise,

562
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:17,180
at the first sign of hardship,

563
00:34:17,181 --> 00:34:20,600
you're just going to quit and you're
going to go back to your, the,

564
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:24,080
the high paying job, which I think is a
lot. It's a danger for a lot of people.

565
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:28,550
They don't give their their business or
they idea enough time to really incubate.

566
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,810
When I was,
uh,

567
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,720
when I started traveling Nawara
while I still had my full time job,

568
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:37,370
so I started traveling war in 2013.
I got my job in 2000.

569
00:34:37,371 --> 00:34:39,320
I started talking to Laura
two months after I got my job.

570
00:34:39,321 --> 00:34:44,290
So all I needed was that security net
and I was like, okay, boom, this idea,

571
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,960
let's, let's get it going. I started
traveling to war and I didn't quit until,

572
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,070
well, I got fired. So I was
forced into entrepreneurship,

573
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:57,310
but I ran with that idea while I
had a steady paycheck and I wasn't,

574
00:34:57,741 --> 00:35:00,460
I didn't like quit the job
and then start child new are.

575
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:03,440
So I think that's also
something to consider. Hi.

576
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:05,910
I'm also a huge traveling offline.
Um,

577
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:10,260
so you were talking about how one of the
main things I get to through the tough

578
00:35:10,261 --> 00:35:13,380
times is knowing what your mission is and,
and hang onto that.

579
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:18,680
So I'm wondering what is your mission
is personally or the company and how did

580
00:35:18,871 --> 00:35:20,520
you come about pulling it together?

581
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,290
I looked back at um, my thread,
so I went, I told my mom,

582
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:28,280
cause this like Oprah event like a
couple of years ago. And Oprah said,

583
00:35:28,281 --> 00:35:29,210
what's your thread?

584
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,840
What does the thing you were doing when
you were a child that you can link to

585
00:35:32,841 --> 00:35:37,200
what you're doing now? Right?
So if you, if you were you,

586
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:41,850
there's one story that she had that she
gave of a girl who loves to me organized

587
00:35:41,851 --> 00:35:46,200
and she got a file cabinet for her seventh
birthday and was the happiest person

588
00:35:46,201 --> 00:35:46,471
ever.

589
00:35:46,471 --> 00:35:50,100
And now she's like one of
the best accountants in the
country or like something

590
00:35:50,101 --> 00:35:50,881
crazy like that.

591
00:35:50,881 --> 00:35:54,090
But what is the thing that you were doing
when you were young that you stopped

592
00:35:54,091 --> 00:35:56,790
doing? Because people may be saying,
Oh, you can't make any money with this,

593
00:35:56,791 --> 00:35:58,470
or oh like you can't do x.

594
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:03,210
And tie that into the thing that you
were the most passionate about. Right.

595
00:36:03,211 --> 00:36:07,350
So for me, my mom told me the story
when I was one and I left the house.

596
00:36:07,351 --> 00:36:10,260
I would just let myself out.
And I was just walking around.

597
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,600
I was probably throwing snowballs,

598
00:36:12,601 --> 00:36:16,470
like having a good making snow
angels just doing as a one year old.

599
00:36:16,471 --> 00:36:18,900
And so she was like, this
is, this was who you were.

600
00:36:18,901 --> 00:36:23,340
Like you are always wandering around
trying to find the newest adventures.

601
00:36:23,341 --> 00:36:27,900
And so I often tell people I will
go anywhere that's not war torn.

602
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:30,950
You know, I'm, uh, I, I,

603
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:35,610
and I want everybody to feel the same
way that anywhere that you traveled to is

604
00:36:35,611 --> 00:36:38,760
your place to travel to and
you are welcome in that place.

605
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:43,020
And so I think that the mission of
traveling to Ark came out of that.

606
00:36:43,021 --> 00:36:46,710
Like you also belong here and you know,

607
00:36:46,711 --> 00:36:49,080
you don't just because you don't see,
I grew up in Minnesota,

608
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:51,390
Minnesota is very white.
Um,

609
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:55,410
I was like one of three
people in my class, but,

610
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:59,280
and so I grew up living a
very different life. Like I,

611
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:03,810
I was this like one black girl with
the exotic name. People were like,

612
00:37:03,811 --> 00:37:07,020
where are you from? So I shortened
my name to Zim instead of Zim Ozo,

613
00:37:07,021 --> 00:37:08,070
which is my full name.

614
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:12,000
And then I moved to North Carolina where
I was crushing fruit flies and cloning

615
00:37:12,001 --> 00:37:16,050
genes. Like there were no other
black girls in my school who were,

616
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:20,400
who were doing those things. And so I
was always used to just being the other,

617
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:24,720
and it took me time to figure
out that that was also okay.

618
00:37:24,721 --> 00:37:28,680
And I wanted everybody to be able
to feel okay with being other.

619
00:37:28,681 --> 00:37:33,280
And so I think the travel, our
mission kind of came out of that. Hey,

620
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,940
you sound like the emails you send.

621
00:37:35,941 --> 00:37:40,941
Very [inaudible] go back.

622
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:49,260
How do you find time for self?

623
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:55,640
Oh, so I block out, um, so a
couple of a couple of things.

624
00:37:55,641 --> 00:37:59,720
So from like 6:00 AM to
10:00 AM I have like,

625
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,650
just like nothing.

626
00:38:00,651 --> 00:38:04,700
So I usually do a lot of like praying
or reading the Bible or like studying

627
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:08,810
scripture or something like that.
And then I take a one week off per month.

628
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,690
Um,
and yeah,

629
00:38:11,691 --> 00:38:15,410
so I take one week off a month and
that it doesn't usually doesn't include

630
00:38:15,411 --> 00:38:18,770
vacations.
So I kind of mix those all in as well.

631
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:22,120
I am one of the most restful
people you'll meet. I've,

632
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:24,470
I have friends that I
know that are really busy.

633
00:38:24,471 --> 00:38:28,550
I just have them block off a month in
their calendar and send me an invite.

634
00:38:28,551 --> 00:38:30,860
So I know that if they change the days,
you know,

635
00:38:30,861 --> 00:38:34,820
if you send somebody a confirmation,
if you change the time or whatever,

636
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,070
they get the notification.

637
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:39,970
So if I get any notification from my
friends that they moved their off times,

638
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:42,820
I'm calling them and then we're
going to have a serious discussion.

639
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:46,990
And so I think that rest is so important
because who are you without rest?

640
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:50,800
Like if you, if you all worked from
January to December with no days off,

641
00:38:50,801 --> 00:38:55,450
y'all be Frizzell frazzle shaken gray
hair, hair, falling out, everything.

642
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:57,640
And you wouldn't be of no use to anybody.

643
00:38:57,641 --> 00:39:02,440
And so I think that of the things
that I've learned you like, you know,

644
00:39:02,441 --> 00:39:05,770
you have some entrepreneurs that are
like work til you die, like sleep.

645
00:39:05,771 --> 00:39:09,700
Don't like, whatever, like don't
sleep ever. And I'm like, what?

646
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:13,110
Like it doesn't make any sense.
So I think that, you know, it's,

647
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:17,050
I've been very intentional about
the time that I had to myself. Yeah.

648
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:20,620
Hey, thanks for being here. First of all,

649
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:25,370
I would like to know what's next for
treble norm and maybe are there any of the

650
00:39:25,371 --> 00:39:26,310
industries a,

651
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:30,070
was it lack of representation of people
of color that you're looking into

652
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,770
branching into?
Excellent,

653
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:37,820
good question. So for TN
experiences, more destinations, um,

654
00:39:37,821 --> 00:39:40,850
we're launching a new
destination this summer. Um,

655
00:39:40,851 --> 00:39:44,300
we're also looking at different segments.
So I know that I've,

656
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:49,280
I've gone to a lot of conferences where
people who are 50 plus for instance will

657
00:39:49,281 --> 00:39:51,950
be like, I want to go on
your chosen. Everybody,

658
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:55,190
everybody on those trips look
like they're like my children.

659
00:39:55,191 --> 00:39:59,750
They could be my kids. Um, and so,
you know, things like that. Um,

660
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:05,090
there are always places that need
more representation, I think. Um,

661
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:09,890
we've thought about interiors.
We, I mean travel kind of like,

662
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:14,450
it intersects a lot of
different industries and
really interesting and unique

663
00:40:14,451 --> 00:40:16,760
ways. Um, so those are,

664
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,780
those are some of the things that we're
thinking about in terms of what's next.

665
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:23,270
Yeah. I, Hey.

666
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:25,550
Um,
when you were talking,

667
00:40:25,551 --> 00:40:28,670
you talked about execution and how does
importance for each other and ship.

668
00:40:28,671 --> 00:40:32,770
And when you answered your question also
about taking time for herself and we

669
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,790
don't rest. And I, she liked,

670
00:40:34,791 --> 00:40:37,580
most of us always have the
solution that we're going to do.

671
00:40:37,581 --> 00:40:39,800
What's important now and
we're going to rest later.

672
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:44,360
Or You like this since day one or did
you have this moment of, you know,

673
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:49,400
I think in six months when it's going
to take off, I'll rest then her. So, uh,

674
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:52,910
so I was where I was actually working.
So when I moved to San Francisco,

675
00:40:52,911 --> 00:40:56,030
I had the four jobs, right?
So I was like a crazy person.

676
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,530
And then when I got my full
time job as a producer,

677
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:02,760
I'm in San Francisco and
I started travel noire.

678
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:05,360
I did those two jobs simultaneously.

679
00:41:05,361 --> 00:41:10,040
So I would work on travel and war from
6:00 AM to 9:00 AM go to work from nine

680
00:41:10,041 --> 00:41:13,400
to five and then work from traveling
to work on traveling war from five to

681
00:41:13,401 --> 00:41:17,660
midnight and then like do it all over
again until I got myself sick. Um,

682
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:22,450
and like I wound up in a hospital
and then I realize like, oh,

683
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,310
I don't know, like I can't,
you can't do that forever.

684
00:41:25,311 --> 00:41:27,200
Like hustle isn't sustainable forever.

685
00:41:27,201 --> 00:41:29,450
There is a period of
time and a place for it,

686
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,300
but it can't be an everyday thing.

687
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:36,560
And so that was maybe in May.
So then I was like, all right,

688
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:39,170
so we'll travel noire is
doing pretty good. Um,

689
00:41:39,171 --> 00:41:43,340
I've saved up enough money to like be,
well, it wasn't enough. It was like,

690
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:48,290
it was not, I mean, whatever is
relative, but you know, um, I was like,

691
00:41:48,291 --> 00:41:52,300
okay, so there has to be a time
limit for like working these two,

692
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:56,900
two jobs simultaneously. Like they're
both full time jobs. Um, and so,

693
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:02,240
you know, July was my date that I was
going to say, all right, I'm out of here,

694
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:07,520
but that my boss had other
plans. So, um, so yeah,

695
00:42:07,521 --> 00:42:12,380
I think in the beginning it was very
much like work, work, work, work,

696
00:42:12,381 --> 00:42:14,330
work, work all the time, 24, seven,

697
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:17,630
but then you get sick and
you can't work anymore.

698
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:20,360
Like you can't wear your body if you're,
if you don't give your body rest,

699
00:42:20,361 --> 00:42:21,620
your body's going to force you to rest.

700
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:26,390
And at the point where your
body is forcing you to harass
you, like just no good,

701
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:27,560
no good to anybody.

702
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:31,230
And so it's a lesson that I've
had to learn time and time again,

703
00:42:31,231 --> 00:42:34,910
and those periods of like
working, working, working,
my body is like, all right,

704
00:42:34,911 --> 00:42:39,080
not today. And you just have
to listen because you just,
you can't do anything. Um,

705
00:42:39,081 --> 00:42:42,980
so I think it's a, it's a constant
lesson that as entrepreneurs,

706
00:42:42,981 --> 00:42:44,540
you're taught all the time.

707
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:48,020
I'm going to see your
last question, sorry. Um,

708
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:52,080
do you think the idea is more important
than the execution or is institution?

709
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:54,143
Thank you.

710
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:59,070
Execution. Execution is more important
than idea. Cause you, listen, I,

711
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,460
when I was in living in India,

712
00:43:00,461 --> 00:43:05,461
I had a spreadsheet of like all of these
ideas that I had 80% of them now exist

713
00:43:06,401 --> 00:43:09,820
today. Right? Like I just had these
ideas and I was like, oh, like I do,

714
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:14,140
I could be an idea machine and, but
if I don't execute on them, they just,

715
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:19,180
they're just there, you know, there do
they just exist and excellent execution.

716
00:43:19,181 --> 00:43:22,030
Like you can find ideas and that
you could find ideas anywhere,

717
00:43:22,031 --> 00:43:27,031
but if you have an execution mindset
that any idea that comes your way,

718
00:43:27,131 --> 00:43:28,270
like you can make happen.

719
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:33,970
Yeah. Execution. Great. Well on that note,

720
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:36,010
um, I'll just say thank
you so much for coming in.

721
00:43:36,011 --> 00:43:39,850
I think it's been an inspirational
talk, um, on so many different levels.

722
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:41,800
You've taught us that, you know, we can,

723
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:45,550
we should follow her dreams first
and foremost. You had this, you know,

724
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:49,030
one lust biting of the age of one,
which is pretty amazing,

725
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:50,890
but also the importance of rest.

726
00:43:50,891 --> 00:43:54,160
And that's not easy to be an entrepreneur
that you running your own business is

727
00:43:54,161 --> 00:43:56,650
not the nirvana that some people
think it is. But if read reading,

728
00:43:56,651 --> 00:43:59,830
hold on and challenge yourself and
create a culture within your own company,

729
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:02,290
it could be something that your dreams
are made of. So thank you again.

730
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:04,280
You are a good summary.

731
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:09,760
[inaudible] remember what I
talked about five minutes ago?

732
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:11,410
That's cool.

733
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:12,640
Thank you.
Thanks again.

734
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:18,280
