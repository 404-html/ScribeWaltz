1
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,540
I'm really excited today to welcome
Martin Atkins to talks at Google.

2
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:10,920
He's an entrepreneur,

3
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:16,290
[inaudible]

4
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,930
Martins and entrepreneur and
educator, a musician, producer,

5
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,250
Dj,

6
00:00:22,251 --> 00:00:27,230
and the list goes on with a 35
year career that spans genres,

7
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,560
borders and industries.
You could say that Martins,

8
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:35,210
the definition of entrepreneurial
activity in cultural arts endeavors.

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,680
So to call out a few things from
his massive list of accomplishments.

10
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,600
He was a member of public image limited,

11
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,780
founded the industrial
supergroup pig face,

12
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:49,430
contributed to nine inch nails for which
you won a grammy as well as ministry.

13
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,250
He's the owner of invisible records,

14
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:57,440
mattress factory recording studios and
he's the author of Book Smart Band,

15
00:00:57,441 --> 00:01:01,610
smart tour smart. And I think I probably
left a few other titles out as well.

16
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,160
Uh,
he is also the father of four.

17
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,940
Martin is also the music business
chair at the ASAE institute Chicago.

18
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,900
I think a few of you guys are here
today and he's here to talk about the

19
00:01:15,901 --> 00:01:20,250
creative industry with advice for artists,
musicians and entrepreneurs alike.

20
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,040
He has all kinds of tried,

21
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,990
tested and remixed ideas that all add up
to make a difference in a creative and

22
00:01:27,991 --> 00:01:32,430
arts focused career. He'll share his
perspective around longevity, efficiency,

23
00:01:32,431 --> 00:01:35,700
and having a mindset to plant
the seeds of your own future.

24
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,950
So for Googlers in the audience,

25
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,380
be sure to think of your
questions during the Q and a,

26
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:41,520
which we'll have up at the end.

27
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,570
So please join me in welcoming to
the Google stage, Martin Atkins

28
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,780
[inaudible]

29
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:55,750
thanks for that introduction.
That was kind of awesome.

30
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:59,440
You did miss out one of my books. Welcome
to the music business. You're fucked.

31
00:01:59,441 --> 00:02:04,000
I think you miss that one.
Uh,

32
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,193
so yeah,

33
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:09,430
so I play drum set and I was nine
joined my first band when I was 11.

34
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:14,290
Started Drinking Newcastle Brown Ale
and backing strippers at the age of 12.

35
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:18,940
And it's just been, speaking of
longevity, it's just been a long, slow,

36
00:02:18,941 --> 00:02:23,941
sad decline from Wa in retrospect
as a career high at the age of uh,

37
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,150
he said,
just a little bit of me,

38
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:33,400
my time with public image limited
Katrine Johnny rotten of the sex pistols

39
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,740
to the suicide goes
from American bandstand.

40
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,450
Hello.
What's your name please welcome to empty

41
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:46,530
the
nine inch nails to pig face.

42
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,510
Yeah.
Uh,

43
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,430
I just like seeing that me spitting and
hitting this ruining microphones and

44
00:02:53,431 --> 00:02:56,400
stuff to my books and my third book,

45
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,440
I always forget to do this at the end,
so I want to do it now.

46
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:02,740
If you follow me on Twitter and a r. T. E.

47
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:06,010
E my hilarious eighties joke is for ease.

48
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,570
Just like the old days.
Yeah.

49
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:14,580
Laughter over here from both
students to sit in here going,

50
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,670
Oh, if you follow me on Twitter, you get
a free download of, of my second book. So,

51
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:26,440
well, I'm going to, but this
seems a little bit grandiose.

52
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,780
Little stuff, big stuff and huge
stuff, which is all I could think of.

53
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:36,850
How to describe, uh, this stuff first,

54
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,580
before we get into that,
I wanted to thank,

55
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:44,060
because here in Chicago I wanted
to thank chance the rapper, um,

56
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,830
for donating $1 million
to Chicago public schools.

57
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:57,930
But is anybody else thinking
about what you couldn't do 1.5,

58
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,470
you know,
how to say,

59
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,380
but without going off on too many
tangents before we get started,

60
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,880
do you have any idea how many types
of Kit Kat there are in Japan?

61
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,870
It's absolutely bonkers.
Soy Sauce, Ginger Ale.

62
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,390
I don't know what the
meeting was on that one.

63
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,020
Red Bean pumpkin baked potato kit Kat.

64
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:24,690
Yeah, and I'd love to say we're going
to try them on mark down on your cards,

65
00:04:24,691 --> 00:04:27,620
which I don't have baked potato kit Kat.

66
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,900
I do have some kit kats.

67
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:35,450
Anybody wants to fucking throw out
some kickass now if some pay attention,

68
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,110
we're not having to Google the Lord.

69
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:44,270
I was stabbed in the eye with
a kit Kat piece will come out.

70
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:49,080
I see you. It's all
right. We'll go. We go.

71
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,100
Well or not.
So all we have time for,

72
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,860
does anybody want some kick counts?
It doesn't have kit kats

73
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,180
40. What should I just,
if I pass this over there,

74
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,220
will it get past you? Would you, you
could take a couple of pass it around.

75
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:16,380
That will work on a
system. Uh, also while I'm,

76
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,030
while I'm not on the subject.
Yeah,

77
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:23,040
I'm loving this book hitmakers
by Derek Thompson. I'm really,

78
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:26,220
really loving it.
I think he's the senior editor of

79
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:32,550
Vanity Fair market. Uh, the
Atlantic. It's just awesome.

80
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,060
And while I'm up here,
uh,

81
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,810
I just got Kevin Coval a 10th book,
which is slightly awesome too.

82
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,350
Okay, enough of that. Are
there any rockstars here today?

83
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,720
Let's try that again, Shelly. Hey,

84
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:03,380
Google is,
are there any rock stars here today?

85
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,690
Absolutely. That's more like a hand
in the air. Hand on your crotch.

86
00:06:09,691 --> 00:06:11,600
Doesn't have to be your crutch.
Anybody's,

87
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,600
well that's good news because Jimmy
John's sandwich sharp is looking for some

88
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,520
stars. I don't mean to completely
deflate your ambitions,

89
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,990
but everything just keeps
changing all the time.

90
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,370
Except this slide,

91
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:33,260
which is in every presentation
I've given in the last, I dunno,

92
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,700
10 years,
stuff just keeps changing.

93
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:42,500
Paris got, well there's me
cat before periscope and no
sooner and I go like that.

94
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:45,800
I was at south by southwest two
years ago to kind of go, oh me a cat.

95
00:06:45,801 --> 00:06:49,370
This is interesting.
Oh by the time my fingers hit the keys,

96
00:06:49,371 --> 00:06:50,810
it didn't exist anymore.

97
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:56,200
And Paris got comes along and and that
Instagress was awesome and now they

98
00:06:56,481 --> 00:06:59,450
changed the,
yeah,

99
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,050
I'm liking report a report.

100
00:07:03,051 --> 00:07:07,610
Make sure still images look like video.
It's Kinda cool.

101
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:12,020
And this is just a catastrophe now.
A turntable FM.

102
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:16,400
Does vine still exist even?
Wow.

103
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,090
See it's a good job. I approached
it. That workers, yeah.

104
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,020
Mindspace it's back. No, it isn't.

105
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:28,670
It was even when it was back,
he was like, no, it is a

106
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,240
hoot.
Suite actually is awesome.

107
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,680
Landa is software that masters
your music in a heartbeat.

108
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,460
But as I said,
it's just a mess.

109
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,600
Instagress yeah, it was loving
it. Everything keeps changing.

110
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,580
A Dunkin donuts

111
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,750
making chicken sandwiches,

112
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,800
Burger King donuts,

113
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:01,460
little walls is gone, man. It's
called mad. I'm like, well,

114
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,170
is how this is not right?

115
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:07,280
I drove past Kentucky Fried Chicken
down by the white sox and it's,

116
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:10,670
and the sign outside says
stop on in for a cake.

117
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,003
No,

118
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:19,600
I'm not gonna Vinyl is back
from near extinction just to,

119
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,070
just after I threw all my vital away,

120
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:26,360
I through all the vinyl cassettes are
back and this was a cassette store day

121
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:30,740
2013 and punk is a beer,

122
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:36,380
right? Like I was in a band with
Johnny Ron for five years. Right.

123
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,320
I came up through punk in
London and now it's a beer.

124
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,540
I want to go to the factory
and see the production line.

125
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,450
Kids were doing yellow Mohawk

126
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,060
at least we still have anarchy.

127
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,870
Don't we hear of Google? We
still have anarchy. Don't link.

128
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,510
Sometimes I'll say to my kids,
hey kids,

129
00:09:03,511 --> 00:09:07,170
you feel like a spot of only key today
and I, yeah, I've got four boys. Yes.

130
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,060
Dad was,
yeah,

131
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,740
the revitalizing shower gel from ax.

132
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:19,020
I don't remember what I, lucky smart
light. It's not that I tell you what.

133
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:23,400
There is also an a key for him.
That'd be smelted.

134
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:30,240
Yeah,
it's terrible.

135
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,210
Really bad that you just got
off a plane down. I said,

136
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:41,350
well, your your English, but

137
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:47,340
ladies.
Yeah,

138
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,140
and the key for her,

139
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,070
that just all just blew back.

140
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:59,010
Now here's a tip with anarchy for her.
You don't just spray it,

141
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,280
you spray it and then

142
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,490
you want to try some Chelsea,
Eddie, it's want to pick one.

143
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,760
It's terrible. It's
really, it's really bad.

144
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:22,350
It's just going to be
circulating now. Now, uh, yeah,

145
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,900
there's the anarchy a workout and

146
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:32,640
there's nothing you can do with
that credit card that makes it punk.

147
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,720
You could like buy a bag of
drugs with that critical. It's,

148
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:41,580
there's nothing you can do with
that card that will make it punk.

149
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:49,980
Okay.
Little stuff.

150
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,330
Let's look at some local stuff.

151
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:58,860
We'll move on to bigger stuff and
we'll get to the huge stuff. Well,

152
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,960
maybe we'll spend so much
time on the little stuff.

153
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,740
Who knows what's going to happen.
Fear of selling.

154
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:10,290
Get over it. You know, I,
I pulled up at a venue,

155
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:13,980
we were in Florida and I said to my
friend Chris Mackey, I was doing a talk.

156
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,820
I'm like, should I shouldn't
bring my merchant tonight?

157
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,830
You think it will sell? And
he said, really smartly, uh,

158
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,790
well you won't sell any if
you leave it in the car.

159
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,570
I'm like,
Oh my God,

160
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,250
I'm protecting myself from
putting my wares on display,

161
00:11:35,251 --> 00:11:38,820
which sounds selling my stuff.

162
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:44,700
I'm flying to sell my
shit and we all do that.

163
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,450
You've got to get your stuff
out the car and set it up.

164
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:52,440
And it's not about the selling of it,
although it is.

165
00:11:52,441 --> 00:11:56,650
If you need gas money to get to the
next Gig, it's about the transaction,

166
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,820
which is never about money. It's a
transaction about uh, relationship.

167
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:07,420
Ah, rolling your tee shirts. This is
band related stuff. You Roll your shirts,

168
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:12,250
Kip job, I keep forgetting this
tiny little thing to have a tip jar.

169
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:17,860
I got an email from a band.
They said that tip the tip jar tip

170
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:23,020
as it shall become no saved our band.

171
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,910
I'm like, well, what do you
mean? Like, well it didn't,

172
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,390
but it kind of nearly
did after our first show.

173
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:35,260
We had a bit of an argument
and it was $15 in the tip jar.

174
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:39,370
And we took that and we went to
Denny's and we got like a band meal.

175
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:44,520
It felt like they'd been bought dinner
by some fictitious record label of what

176
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:50,440
good luck getting $15 out of a
record label, but an over dinner.

177
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,280
They talked about what was right about
the day and what was wrong about the day.

178
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:55,830
And it didn't say the band,

179
00:12:55,831 --> 00:12:59,500
but he got them to the next show
and the $15 from the next tip jar.

180
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:03,850
Got them to the show after that. Just
tiny stuff that made a big difference.

181
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:08,860
You have to have it say
something smart on your tip jar.

182
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:13,330
Sexy people tip every time
you tip God saves a kitten.

183
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:16,630
Of course that needs to be changed.
Every time you tip,

184
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:20,200
we'll guillotine a kitten out the back.

185
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,430
That's a genre.
That's how you really make the,

186
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,270
uh,
and of course you need to have ambition.

187
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,870
Have more than one tee shirt.
Have a choice of shirts.

188
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:37,780
Your question cannot be [inaudible].

189
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,690
Would you like to buy a shirt?

190
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:47,510
Your question has to be blocking the exit.

191
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:51,800
Which one of these shirts are you
going to buy now? This one or that one?

192
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,690
It's a very different question.

193
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,460
Giveaway your songs all the time.

194
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,220
Give away everything all the time.

195
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:05,600
And some musicians still her like,
yeah,

196
00:14:05,601 --> 00:14:10,601
we'll give away that demo or that crappy
live recording we did or the that makes

197
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:15,020
it didn't work out very well. That was
cheap. What's give that away. You can't.

198
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:17,810
You have to give away your
best stuff all the time.

199
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:22,400
You have got this one chance to start
a relationship. If you were a bakery,

200
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:28,770
you've got some smoked salmon things,
uh,

201
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:31,120
one watching the great
British baking show.

202
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:36,100
So I'm about to go off at some
flaky Vala vom pastry nightmare.

203
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:41,260
I'm honest. Yeah, great. Yeah, you've got
to watch it. Great British baking show.

204
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,640
Very real. Oh well, great. British
baking show and heroin. Really relaxing.

205
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,440
So you're this bakery and you've got
the smoked Salmon Boulevard thing that

206
00:14:51,441 --> 00:14:53,930
costs you a fortune is
complicated and difficult to make.

207
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,210
You don't want to give that way.

208
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:01,430
We've also got some style bagel chips
that didn't turn out very well and some

209
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,050
somebody tripped,

210
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:06,590
drop them on the floor and now you've
got style Bagel chips that people didn't

211
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:09,620
really like. And there's probably
some cat hair mixed in with them too.

212
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,860
You can't give them away.

213
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:17,810
That's the end of your relationship with
your freestyle cat hair infested bagel

214
00:15:17,811 --> 00:15:18,644
chips.

215
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:23,830
You've got to give away the smoked Salmon
Vala thing and there's a relationship.

216
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,030
Oh, I'm hungry. Anybody else hungry? Now

217
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,600
it's time to remove the protective cap.
So come on everybody.

218
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,860
This is leftover from my sports.
Let you remove.

219
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:42,850
So eighties business nineties
business was this, wasn't it?

220
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,990
Everybody's protecting their shit.
Oh,

221
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,960
that can't be how we act anymore.

222
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,290
You've got to put your
arms down to the side

223
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,980
and give people a hammer.

224
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,600
Here's the thing, the bigger
the hammer you give to somebody,

225
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:08,710
the less likely they are to
smash you in the Crotch with it,

226
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,910
right? If you do that,
if you put on the side,

227
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:18,070
you want to have my mind and you'd give
me some GI Joe Toy, miniature hammer. Oh,

228
00:16:18,071 --> 00:16:19,510
find a what?
I'll kill you with it.

229
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:26,190
If you give me a sledge
hammer, I'd be like, Oh yeah,
here we go. Bring it on. Who?

230
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:30,160
That one too. I can't
mate. Let's go have a beer.

231
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:33,790
The bigger the hammer you give,

232
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:38,160
the less likely people are to
smash you in the crotch with it.

233
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,960
I don't just talk about this stuff.
This is my version of the hammer.

234
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,980
I did a thing on my website Christmas Eve.
Hey,

235
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:51,400
things are going pretty good for me.
If they're not going very well for you,

236
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,810
pick a discount

237
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:57,520
and Bolton by my sledgehammer slide

238
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:02,520
and I put those discounts.
It was,

239
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:05,770
I felt like punk rock to me,
right?

240
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:10,890
40% 50% 90% do you know the discount that
I didn't imagine people would use that

241
00:17:12,311 --> 00:17:16,590
they used a lot?
I'm like,

242
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,620
holy crap.

243
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:22,000
Why would somebody use 0% when you've
got a choice of 30 50 90 I don't know,

244
00:17:22,001 --> 00:17:27,001
but lots of people did because I gave
a big sledgehammer 90% next time I do

245
00:17:28,211 --> 00:17:32,320
this, so I got busy, but I'm going to
do it again. I think I'll do 100% now.

246
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,810
I'm not just going to do
100% and they go on holiday,

247
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:38,820
I'm going to do 100% sit
by the laptop going, oh,

248
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:44,470
get ready to shut that down.
All temporary temporary, oh,

249
00:17:44,471 --> 00:17:48,880
this servers crashed. Right.
Be Smart about it, but

250
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:54,870
it's trust that was selling.
Ah, that's not right is it?

251
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:59,310
It's trust that we're building.
It's trust that we're making.

252
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,880
It's trust that we choose to create
this obstacle course for in a way.

253
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:11,130
Yeah.
It's no real reason for this slide.

254
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:17,730
There's a quote from Chuck D's. I could
seem like, yeah, so what junk d says,

255
00:18:17,731 --> 00:18:20,640
what you know is what you're saying
and what are you save is what you make,

256
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:24,210
but really it's just me and chuck the,
I was hanging out with Chuck d.

257
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,113
We go,

258
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,230
there's no more of that,
and it's like, check.

259
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:34,980
It's just me and you and
a Richard Branson anyway,

260
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:42,120
so protect your assets.
You need assets.

261
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:46,680
Always have something else to sell,
right? All this free stuff is great,

262
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,950
but if you only have one shot at
one song, one thing, you're screwed.

263
00:18:49,951 --> 00:18:54,180
When you give it away, you need 10
more things and other things besides,

264
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,530
so when you give something away,

265
00:18:55,531 --> 00:18:59,220
you're stimulating and creating this
other part of this relationship.

266
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,710
Bigger stuff.

267
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:08,910
You want to spread your message far and
wide. We start to think geographically.

268
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:12,990
We start to look at a map. Where are
we going to go now? Installed Jacuzzi,

269
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:17,820
go to culinary school, start
brewing amazing beer. Thanks.

270
00:19:17,821 --> 00:19:22,650
Lance has one of my favorite beers in the
world. That is, I buy some extra beds.

271
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,710
These are the reasons things will
be better. Two years from now,

272
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:30,570
I met this woman in Cleveland and I don't
know if she was at a talk somewhere,

273
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:35,610
one of my talks and she said,
well at least I know wherever my son goes,

274
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,780
he'll have people helping him, protecting
him, but cool. How'd you know that?

275
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:43,980
And she shows me this book,
this tattered book,

276
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:49,180
you know one of those line books with
the pen stuffed in it and she did all of

277
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:50,760
those things.
She went to culinary school,

278
00:19:50,761 --> 00:19:52,860
they put a laundry in
the basement for beds,

279
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:57,870
screaming internet and invited every band
coming through town to stay with them

280
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:01,380
and she made them breakfast. She
helped them with the laundry, right?

281
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:06,410
She did all of that cool stuff and
created connections for her son,

282
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,320
a safety net for her song. Like
that's genius. So we think,

283
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,810
how can we be huge in Cleveland?

284
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,350
Stay where you are and invite pants
from Cleveland to come stay with you and

285
00:20:16,351 --> 00:20:18,570
then go and stay with them.
Of course someone will break up,

286
00:20:18,571 --> 00:20:21,080
some of them won't answer
the phone when you call.

287
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:26,520
That's just the roll of the dice
that's on them. Don't just do more,

288
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:29,620
be more. Right. Um,

289
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,020
I got a nice piece on NPR about this.

290
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:39,420
I don't have time to talk you through it.
My blackberry jam scam a story.

291
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:42,620
If you go to NPR,
all songs considered that's,

292
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:46,950
there's a few nice stories actually.
Me planting trees for Bon Jovi's drama.

293
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,790
High Point for me.
What did he do with your summer?

294
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,890
I was planting trees for Bon Jovi.
Strummer

295
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,870
you've got to stay on top
of the newest technology.

296
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:01,480
It's like ironic why I'm
standing here with Google.

297
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,600
You've got to stay on top of all of them.

298
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,453
Newest Shit

299
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:13,310
really did. Was there, does
that mean, oh, it's me. Sorry.

300
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:16,820
That is me.
Yeah,

301
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:23,880
well I'm doing it. Google talk. Yeah,

302
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,420
no, say hilarious. Yeah,
it's a phone. Yeah,

303
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:35,130
but you do. I'm joking about
it, but you know it's important.

304
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:39,230
Technology, technology,
technology. You've got mail walk,

305
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:44,520
you've got mail,
but you're laughing.

306
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:50,270
He'd say it's 9.0 go all on my laptop.

307
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:57,210
One of my favorite things to do while
I'm in the green room at some conference.

308
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,530
I like Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee.
I'll make sure my volume is on full.

309
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:04,290
Make sure there's a bunch
of people sitting in the
grim talking about their new

310
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:08,720
startup and you're, oh, we're bootstrap
this and bloody blah, and I hit back.

311
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,110
I'm just like,
honestly,

312
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:13,800
I'm going to have to start traveling
with an ambulance or something cause the

313
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:14,643
whiplash.

314
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:19,730
When people hear that it's just fantastic
and I don't kind of get up and go,

315
00:22:21,061 --> 00:22:24,390
ha ha, I have to sit there
and pretend like I'm an idiot,

316
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:31,160
but they're the idiots.
Oh,

317
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:32,940
we got a little bit off track there,
but let's,

318
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:37,590
let's get back to do something different.
It different,

319
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:42,450
do something different, do more of
what works and less of what doesn't.

320
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:45,090
That's the great thing about all
the apps and technology. These,

321
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:49,260
you can track something immediately.
This is a great idea. No,

322
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:53,490
it isn't change. It's a
right. Do something else.

323
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,960
Efficiency.
I got pulled into this all the time.

324
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,770
People want to do things more efficiently.
There's no such thing as efficiency.

325
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:06,950
We just sit a pig face show last year
and people bought tickets from me and uh,

326
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:13,740
they got a pair of tee shirts and it's
some coupons and some other stuff.

327
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:17,910
And so I'm sending her all these packages
to people have a list of all these

328
00:23:17,911 --> 00:23:21,780
addresses of people who wanted to come
and see my band pig face. I'm like, well,

329
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:26,550
I've got to write a note
and I have to put their name on it.

330
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:31,290
I have to sign it, which makes perfect
sense. If you're talking to your grandma,

331
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,870
right,
there's 450 packages going out.

332
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:38,730
That's not nothing that
we put in a science CD,

333
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:43,290
which is not nothing to unwrap a bunch of
cds to sign and then let them dry them,

334
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:48,150
put them in. Then I put handfuls
of and assembles cause we're,

335
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:52,340
we're building or cementing or
reinvigorating these relationships.

336
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:55,250
So the efficiencies just not end it.

337
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,960
There needs to be a column
on the spreadsheet for Vibe
grooviness and something

338
00:24:03,111 --> 00:24:07,520
else I can't think of. Right. That
shouldn't be on the spreadsheet.

339
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,690
Okay.

340
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:12,870
We'll talk about longevity in a bit,
but yeah.

341
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:20,880
No reason, no reason.
This slide, that slide,

342
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:25,710
sometimes it feels like he's pointing.
Get the fuck over.

343
00:24:25,711 --> 00:24:28,770
Whatever it is. It's
something, just get over it.

344
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:34,170
Technical ability.
This is worth mentioning.

345
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:41,450
I think many of us want to
be really good at one thing.

346
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:46,950
Doesn't matter. I was hanging out
with John Langford from the metcons,

347
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:52,270
uh, Tuesday night and he said
he started the [inaudible].

348
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:55,380
He played Johnson and me comes
not because he was a good drummer,

349
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,910
he had a drum kit.
I was there and one of the guys,

350
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,580
the other guys in the past, if you want
to start with, none of us can play.

351
00:25:02,581 --> 00:25:06,360
Should we start a band and they think
they're celebrating their 40th anniversary

352
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:07,403
this year.

353
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:12,720
He's a nine year old prodigy guitarists
on the Ellen degeneres show about to

354
00:25:12,721 --> 00:25:17,640
meet Ozzie. He's a seven year
old drama with 13 million hits.

355
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,700
Whatever it is,
you're good at typing to youtube,

356
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:26,670
whatever your good at child prodigy.

357
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:34,420
Within three minutes you'll be
down at u break. I fix cars.

358
00:25:34,421 --> 00:25:38,290
You cried into your laptop
and the salty tears,

359
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,540
what sparked me off keyboard.

360
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:47,700
There might be one or two people sit and
he goes, yeah, this doesn't apply to me.

361
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:51,480
I'm a pilot.
Yeah.

362
00:25:51,481 --> 00:25:54,430
So is this five year old kid from China

363
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:06,000
always say yes to everything.
Difficult for me.

364
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:08,830
I'm kind of shy and uh,
if there's like,

365
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:10,683
okay,

366
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:16,000
so I'm bummed revealing this part of me.
You want to laugh?

367
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,640
Okay,
go ahead and left.

368
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:24,363
Ah,

369
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:29,630
this like a three year lag between
one of my slides in me actually doing

370
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:33,530
something about it, I've
just realized. Right. Um,

371
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:38,190
but I would say south by
southwest Edu and, uh, uh,

372
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:43,100
I met the mayor of Austin who's doing
some amazing shit right now for sure. And,

373
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:46,470
um, it was this long day and, uh,

374
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:50,730
just about to get in the elevator
and he's Canadian educators say, Hey,

375
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:56,080
let's go for Sushi. I'm like,
ah. I felt myself going, Eh, ah,

376
00:26:56,270 --> 00:27:00,570
and I'm like, I'd like to, well, it's been
a long day, blah, blah, blah. Do you know,

377
00:27:00,571 --> 00:27:02,450
uh,
and I'm like,

378
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:07,800
do you remember your slides from the
last four years? Mine? And I'm like, yes.

379
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:11,910
Had the most amazing time talking
about education in Canada.

380
00:27:11,911 --> 00:27:16,650
It's very different than Canada,
obviously. Uh, so I use this,

381
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:21,000
the guy who kind of taught me that was
either beyond some from enslaved long

382
00:27:21,001 --> 00:27:24,780
story, but, uh, it was kind of amazing.

383
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,450
Let's try,
can we,

384
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:31,770
let's have a pact between ourselves here
today to be more awesome than a pastor

385
00:27:31,771 --> 00:27:34,680
restaurant.
Can we do that?

386
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:39,870
Does everybody agreed to be more
awesome than a pastor restaurant?

387
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:46,170
Because, uh, yeah, I feel you
thinking of what I thought,

388
00:27:46,171 --> 00:27:49,010
he said, pastor, I should've
said pastor restaurant.

389
00:27:49,011 --> 00:27:51,450
It shouldn't pastor restaurant.

390
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:57,570
But uh, they had this thing,
I think a year ago was, hey,

391
00:27:57,571 --> 00:28:01,290
you want to come in and need some of
our pastor will watch your kids for two

392
00:28:01,291 --> 00:28:03,660
hours? I'm like, wow.

393
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:08,490
So originally I put this slide in
my talk because it was like, wow.

394
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,320
And then I started to get upset,

395
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:15,600
like I'm pointing at a pastor
restaurant for us to like aspire to,

396
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:21,750
you know, and now I start to
see bands on Facebook. Well,

397
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,460
where Ohio, where were you
Friday? Where was everybody wears?

398
00:28:26,461 --> 00:28:29,450
I seen what's going on.
Just having to go up.

399
00:28:29,451 --> 00:28:34,320
People who didn't come to their show.
Nobody cares.

400
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:39,930
Nobody cares about anything
that's important to you for
a moment. I'm in a band.

401
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:44,730
Yeah, I'm a DJ or I'm a terrible
Dj. He didn't mention that. Josh,

402
00:28:44,731 --> 00:28:48,780
I'm really bad. I will could destroy
your wedding. Not In a good way.

403
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,440
I could just completely
destroy your winning. But

404
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:59,090
I thought how many artists
would watch their fans kids,

405
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,840
right?
So let's aspire to do that.

406
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:07,110
Let's stop being shit start being awesome.

407
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:12,360
Your brand is a band and you want
to have your customers be fans.

408
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,900
So do your fines. Laundry. This
is where I lose everybody, right?

409
00:29:15,901 --> 00:29:18,060
If I'm doing a music that
people just like, oh yeah.

410
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:24,470
Normally I'll say drugs will do
something to try and get people. But,

411
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:29,130
but you think about it, I don't know if
you've got, Google is here who are like,

412
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,970
hey, how's it going? I don't
know how you guys get along,

413
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:38,100
but there's gotta be some,
Hey, record release pie. Ah,

414
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:42,760
I'm busy. I haven't told you what it
is yet. Now, but I'm going to be busy.

415
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,440
Nobody cares.
Nobody cares.

416
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:52,960
So why not have your music release party?

417
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:57,580
You'll launch whatever is a longterm
mountain. Now the conversation different.

418
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,400
Hey, we're having a release party. Ooh.

419
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:04,900
And everybody gets two loads of
laundry to old. When is that?

420
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:09,700
Let me put, let me dial it.
Ain't no my phone. Boom,

421
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:14,140
because nobody cares.
I'm sure some people will show up,

422
00:30:14,141 --> 00:30:17,170
but just get the long term,
screw them.

423
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:21,520
But you can manipulate the situation.

424
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:27,210
You can slide the owner of the laundromat
$50 would probably do it to like dial

425
00:30:28,781 --> 00:30:33,610
back the temperature on the dryers.
So how far in you can be like,

426
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:38,470
hey, whoa, whoa, hey, sorry. Terribly
sorry. No disrespect to you Mike.

427
00:30:38,471 --> 00:30:39,970
This is a fantastic laundromat.

428
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,830
There is a problem with the dryers
were putting in more dryer sheets.

429
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:48,790
We're going to keep the party going.
Somebody brought a case of beer.

430
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,930
Let's listen to the album more. More
time. People are like, fuck, you know,

431
00:30:52,931 --> 00:30:54,450
what are people going to do?
You've got,

432
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:57,880
and they're held captive now
by their own wet laundry,

433
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:04,650
right?
Unsure five listens to you.

434
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:07,120
But yeah, two albums to listen.
So you could get away with,

435
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:11,190
it's a red bull and monster, but there
will be people who are called screw house,

436
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:14,920
screw the hat,
but at least I got clean underwear.

437
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:20,820
I'm thinking nine days later when
they still got clean underwear,

438
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:25,060
they're like, screw the
house guys. Ha ha ha, I win.

439
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:29,900
But you know what,
the songs are pretty good.

440
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:35,690
I kinda like him. Let me dial her up
again. I wonder if that playing close by,

441
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,820
right?
That's that trusting again.

442
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:43,520
Nobody cares about what's important to
you. Everyone's got doing underwear.

443
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:48,340
You win
as well.

444
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:52,390
We lose everybody else.
Get the fuck out of bed.

445
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:57,740
I'm lucky my kids have kind of grown now.

446
00:31:57,741 --> 00:32:00,050
Coal is eight I was going to be nine soon,

447
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:04,560
but when he was three or four
most mornings, ah Eh. Ah,

448
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,520
before four 35 I'm getting
kicked in the back.

449
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:10,670
I've got congeal puke
across the back of my neck.

450
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:15,290
Similar to some of the situations.
I think you guys wake up in most mornings,

451
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:21,950
but here's the deal. I'm up at five.
I'm five hours ahead of my arch rival.

452
00:32:21,951 --> 00:32:24,800
Ironically, the lead singer
in a band called arch rivals

453
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:31,250
five hours. Big Deal, but at the
end of the week, I'm 35 hours ahead.

454
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:37,820
That's 1000 I know you've
done the math in your head.

455
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:42,680
It's 1000 hundred and 20 hours a year.
76 days ahead.

456
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:47,720
That's the difference.
Just in case you're wondering,

457
00:32:47,721 --> 00:32:49,430
they get the fuck out of bed.

458
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:54,790
A theme is also available as fantastic
performance hall pillowcase set

459
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,870
and uh,
I'm not just a crazy punk rocker.

460
00:32:59,871 --> 00:33:04,070
You can't just have these slides up
at Google. You have to have cats.

461
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:08,130
The cats are swung it. No, this,

462
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:12,650
this get the fuck out of all of this cats.
I think those are no blacks cuts.

463
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:17,470
Dynasty podcast cats, the
dynasty podcasts. That's,

464
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,033
that has

465
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:24,890
a couple of quotes before I get to the,
the big huge stuff.

466
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:28,370
This is Dale Carnegie. My Dad
sent me this quote. Thanks Dad.

467
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:32,120
You can make more friends in two months
by being interested in other people.

468
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:35,840
Then you can make in two years trying to
get other people interested in you that

469
00:33:35,841 --> 00:33:39,070
she's, I've like asterisk unless
you do the laundry, you know,

470
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:40,940
love that quote.

471
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:45,860
It's another good one about community
and neighbor is defined as one of the

472
00:33:45,861 --> 00:33:49,850
resides 40 houses to one's right,
40 houses to one's left,

473
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:53,900
40 houses in front,
40 houses behind.

474
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:56,970
I think that's the correct.

475
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:00,500
Always be nice to everyone.

476
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,620
Be Nice to the people with the least
reason for you to be nice to them.

477
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:07,820
You can't be strategic about being nice,
just be nice.

478
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:12,050
The good thing is there were
some people being nice to them.

479
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:15,350
You'd have to buy them a
car and if someone's at that
point where you've got to

480
00:34:15,351 --> 00:34:17,180
buy a car for them to go,
thanks for the car,

481
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,490
the car isn't going to
make a difference anyway.

482
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:22,940
The time to make a difference
is when it's a smile,

483
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:26,180
a sandwich not being an asshole.
Right.

484
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:30,380
That's a huge thing to do to be nice
to someone you don't know the context.

485
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:33,560
Maybe their partner just left them.

486
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:39,530
Maybe they just got this ridiculous
electric bill or a speeding fine or

487
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,720
something.
Just be nice.

488
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:46,160
See what I did here with the here,
it's so big.

489
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:51,040
It's like a typographic thing.
We don't have to get into it now.

490
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,330
I'll be sticking around afterwards.
How do we put 20,000 fans in the stadium?

491
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,760
I'm going to answer that question,
uh, more on my subscription site.

492
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:07,250
That's like a question, right? How do
we do that? How do we get to there?

493
00:35:07,251 --> 00:35:11,870
On the billboard chart. Yeah.
Don't know. I don't fucking know,

494
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,820
but I know something.

495
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:19,720
I know every single person in this room
could make friends with two people today

496
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:23,550
of all days. You want to and we're
not going to do somewhat. Oh,

497
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:27,040
turn to the person. [inaudible] punch him
in the face it, I'm not going to do it,

498
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:32,270
but that's all this stuff is.
If you make two France today or six,

499
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:35,180
we're not going to do the math.
We'll keep it at twos. Right?

500
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,940
Every day you make two friends.
Now it gets a little bit played.

501
00:35:38,941 --> 00:35:42,960
Spinny you've got to stay in touch with
the friends you made eight weeks ago.

502
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,710
Right? You've got to keep that plate
spinning, but that's all it is.

503
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:50,820
When you approach it as, how do we
put 20,000 people in, you're screwed.

504
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,650
If you're approaching it as,

505
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:56,640
I could make two friends today
and you get better at it,

506
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:01,710
you'll have days where you make 20 friends
or 20 potential longer term friends.

507
00:36:01,711 --> 00:36:02,460
Right,

508
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:06,030
and you'll have days where you do do
some terrible stuff that doesn't make any

509
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:08,070
difference.
That's it.

510
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:12,480
There isn't any huge stuff.

511
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:18,210
There is a huge stuff.
There's just small stuff plus time.

512
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:23,390
That's all there is. And so we've
all been like, uh, what does that,

513
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:27,810
uh,
we're like a Stockholm syndrome,

514
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:32,340
prisoners of music business and the key
holders who want us to believe like,

515
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:36,640
oh one day we'll,

516
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:40,620
we'll it's behind this
curtain and actually there's
a door behind the curtain.

517
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,390
We could go through there. There's another
room with more curtains were pulled,

518
00:36:44,391 --> 00:36:44,721
the curtains,

519
00:36:44,721 --> 00:36:49,410
you get the key that gets the key to
the digital combination of the one day.

520
00:36:49,411 --> 00:36:51,200
We'll take you there.
I said,

521
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:53,970
I want you to know this is
no fucking secret 20 event.

522
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:59,240
Just one day making to France
one day making two more friends.

523
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:03,730
You know, when I came up, uh,

524
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:07,740
a lot of really good things
happen to me very quickly.

525
00:37:07,741 --> 00:37:10,650
I was on the front cover of melody maker.
That was just weird as hell.

526
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:14,790
He used to walk past the news agents on
my way to my government job when I was

527
00:37:14,791 --> 00:37:18,510
18 in London, and that's the
melody maker, NME sounds,

528
00:37:18,511 --> 00:37:23,511
all those magazines smash hits probably
and fantasize like one day that could be

529
00:37:23,881 --> 00:37:27,690
me at the age of 18 I'm on the front
cover. We didn't live television.

530
00:37:27,691 --> 00:37:29,580
We came over here,
we did American bandstand,

531
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:31,260
went to Japan and did all this stuff.

532
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,600
But I had this smash and grab
mentality of like, um, the,

533
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:40,800
I would have less time than a
superstar soccer player. Right.

534
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:44,640
What we got two years
grabbed a case of beer.

535
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:49,350
We're at not realizing I, you know, I
met Joe Shanahan from the Metro in 1991.

536
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:53,130
I still see him with his
kids, Dave and busters. Right?

537
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:54,950
He's just don't think like that.

538
00:37:55,470 --> 00:38:00,470
You just like get the [inaudible] wish
[inaudible] Wa this just relationships,

539
00:38:03,301 --> 00:38:05,640
people trust and community.

540
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:10,410
I want you to start looking at things
like that. The efficiency thing,

541
00:38:10,411 --> 00:38:11,460
it's just a no brainer.

542
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:16,970
It doesn't matter if I'm creating a
relationship that could go on for touch

543
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:20,010
wood, there's no course,
there's no word in his

544
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:27,000
relationships that could
go on for 30 40 50 years.

545
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:30,420
It's the front end
takes whatever it takes.

546
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,800
It's not one thing.
It's hundred

547
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,133
or four 20

548
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:44,170
got the students back. Lost some
students with the laundry. Oh yeah.

549
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:46,040
This genius.
It's genius.

550
00:38:46,041 --> 00:38:51,041
What he's saying now and big letters
for 24 20 big oh now losing it.

551
00:38:51,471 --> 00:38:54,290
What's going on?
420,000

552
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:56,630
is the number.

553
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:01,670
Anybody know what that number is now?
Okay.

554
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:07,910
It's how many cats you get.
If you don't spay one cap,

555
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:13,403
Google it.

556
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,210
[inaudible]

557
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:24,740
well, if you don't Spec, of
course he's not from that one cap,

558
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:29,760
which I think you were thinking from
all the cats that come because of low

559
00:39:29,761 --> 00:39:33,110
Spain. That cat, there's probably
eight the first time it has a litter,

560
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:37,430
but butt balm,
so what we need to be is,

561
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:42,960
well, we can't, we got to speak. I
don't want to say we shouldn't, right,

562
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:47,780
but one of my kids said to me,
this marketing thing,

563
00:39:47,781 --> 00:39:51,410
dad,
it's like zombies.

564
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:56,560
It's like a Zombie thing.
Where are you going with this son?

565
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:59,750
Who you Harrison and,
and well,

566
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:04,250
it's like a Zombie by some person and
there's two and then those two zombies by

567
00:40:04,251 --> 00:40:07,360
Tim benders for, it's like grains
of wheat on the chessboard, right?

568
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:09,350
Eight 1632.

569
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:14,650
So my last piece of advice to you is
to be a not splayed Zombie kitten.

570
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,610
This title of my next book.
That's rare,

571
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:28,240
but that's when we got to be not spayed.

572
00:40:28,241 --> 00:40:32,110
Zombie kittens buying people having,
yeah.

573
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:39,650
And of course we always
need to throw muffins.

574
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,560
That's my shit.

575
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:51,020
[inaudible]

576
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,330
I don't have any control
over these bags of muffins.

577
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:02,740
Does anybody desperate for a muffin?
It's not code.

578
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,040
It's just once again,
please.

579
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:10,220
I ice forward icefall would
say

580
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:15,390
dining in the air.
Uh,

581
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:19,780
one of my favorite moments
that south by southwest,

582
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,140
I picked up, I picked up a box, right?

583
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:29,860
And I thought I couldn't get the little
bags all the way to the back. I thought,

584
00:41:29,861 --> 00:41:34,320
well, I'll just, I'll kick this right.
There was somebody sitting there,

585
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,240
it hit,

586
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:39,500
I bet you've never heard such a bang
and just hit this guy in the face,

587
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,170
and we're still friends to this day,
which I'll just,

588
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:47,120
I don't know why I was saying anybody
want to go for the whole, well,

589
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:50,540
it's easy sitting down with
you. Find some muffins. Yeah.

590
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:54,020
I thought overall to talk was pretty good.
He made some good points and blah,

591
00:41:54,021 --> 00:41:54,854
blah,
blah.

592
00:41:55,160 --> 00:42:00,160
People don't realize the preparation
that goes into something like this.

593
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:05,550
Why I'm sitting up all night
opening these bags, masturbate in.

594
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:10,380
He his back, he Pete ceiling. It's just,

595
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:13,400
it's like six or seven hours right there.

596
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:22,130
That's my, that's my,
that's me. Thank you.
