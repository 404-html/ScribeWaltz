1
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:07,683
Right.

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,650
Thank you for coming. I'm impressed. Uh,

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,800
and flattered that you'd come. Number
one to hear me. And number two,

4
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,810
uh,
I mentioned to mark earlier,

5
00:00:20,811 --> 00:00:23,480
the world would come to a
screeching halt without Google.

6
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:24,890
I'm just pretty convinced of that.

7
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:29,891
We are all so dependent now on Google
so it's actually pretty have much of an

8
00:00:30,051 --> 00:00:32,210
honor to be here to talk to you.

9
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:36,410
What I want to do is talk to you a little
bit about the work we're doing at the

10
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:39,110
university and we have
a research center there.

11
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:44,360
And I want to share with you some
of what I think is important for

12
00:00:44,361 --> 00:00:45,200
organizations,

13
00:00:45,201 --> 00:00:50,201
for leaders and maybe for parents and
friends and colleagues even that is a,

14
00:00:51,471 --> 00:00:56,240
I want to talk to you about the power
of and the importance of positive

15
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,400
leadership,
positive practices,

16
00:00:58,401 --> 00:01:02,870
positive dynamics for individuals
and for organizations. So,

17
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:05,840
um,

18
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,840
I want to have you think
about align across this slide
as representing a deviant

19
00:01:11,991 --> 00:01:15,440
continuum now in English that we're,

20
00:01:15,441 --> 00:01:17,360
deviants has a negative connotation.

21
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,550
So normally deviance means you're in
trouble, you're doing something wrong.

22
00:01:22,551 --> 00:01:25,490
If I call you a deviant,
normally a criticism,

23
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,090
but deviants just means an
aberration from the norm. Unexpected,

24
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,180
not normal behavior show.

25
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,320
There's several implications of
thinking of deviants on a continuum,

26
00:01:36,321 --> 00:01:38,030
so you can think of negative deviance,

27
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:40,970
but you can also think
of positive deviance.

28
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,640
Several implications,

29
00:01:43,641 --> 00:01:47,810
one of which is all organizations
exist to eliminate deviance.

30
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:53,660
The reason we organize just to eliminate
unexpected abberant not normal behavior.

31
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:57,950
So mark stands up, everybody stops
talking, everybody looks forward.

32
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:02,090
We organize, otherwise it's
chaos. We can't get anything done.

33
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:07,870
Show all organizations aspire
by definition toward the
middle of that continuum.

34
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:13,970
That is, we don't want deviance,
unexpected aberrant behavior.

35
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:19,370
So for the most part, organizations
or organizing puts us in the middle.

36
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,870
Another important implication is we
know a lot more about one end of this

37
00:02:23,871 --> 00:02:28,760
continuum than the other. So for
example, think of physical health.

38
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:34,010
On the lefthand side, we'd call that
illness. I got the flu, I got diabetes,

39
00:02:34,011 --> 00:02:34,880
I got a heart disease.

40
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:40,240
90% of all medical research focuses on
the gap between the left hand side in the

41
00:02:41,481 --> 00:02:45,500
middle. It's right and five six,
five meal. If I'm having difficulty,

42
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,670
I will get studied. There will be
pharmaceutical products produced for me.

43
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:53,450
People will do all kinds of
tests as soon as I'm healthy.

44
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,950
I mean I get a physical exam once
in a while, but for the most part,

45
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,650
medical science doesn't
pay much attention me.

46
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,400
So we know a lot more about the
lefthand side than the right hand side.

47
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,600
Another important implication,
excuse me,

48
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,960
is that hardly any research is done
in psychology on anything except the

49
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:20,350
lefthand side of that continuum.
So for example, physical,

50
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,243
uh,

51
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:25,420
physical health gets a lot of attention,

52
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:29,020
but psychological health gets a lot
of attention to, for the most part,

53
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:30,490
psychologists are in a business.

54
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:35,440
95% of publications focus
on schizophrenia. Stress,

55
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,790
depression, anxiety.
I'm not doing so well.

56
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,790
Emotional difficulties.
That's where we focus.

57
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,010
But see on the right hand
side of that continuum,

58
00:03:45,011 --> 00:03:48,910
there is something called
positively deviant health.

59
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:53,560
Physically it's Olympic fitness levels,
5% body fat for man,

60
00:03:53,561 --> 00:03:57,640
15% body fat for women.
The ability to run an ironman competition.

61
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,120
How many different than me?
You know, some research,

62
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,030
not much psychologically it's similar.

63
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:08,350
Some years ago there was a book
written called flow. It was about,

64
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:12,370
describes a condition where you're
so immersed in a task you care about,

65
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:16,900
you lose track of time, you lose track
a physiological needs if you're using,

66
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,000
if you put electrodes on your brain,

67
00:04:19,001 --> 00:04:21,560
you're using more of your brain
capacity than normal sounds.

68
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,110
Zoning out in front of a screen. It's
hyper activity mentally. Not much.

69
00:04:26,111 --> 00:04:28,390
Research on that a little bit.
Not much.

70
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:32,860
So there is positively deviant phenomena.
We just don't pay much attention to it.

71
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,200
Organizationally,
it's very similar.

72
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,720
If you go to the business school
at the University of Michigan,

73
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,190
many of the courses, half the courses
probably will hand you a case study.

74
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:47,140
The normal assignment is, all right, what
are the issues? What are the challenges?

75
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,710
What has gone wrong? Come up with some
recommendations and defend yourself.

76
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:53,350
I went, how are we going to make money?
How are we gonna overcome the competition?

77
00:04:53,351 --> 00:04:58,351
And so on that as we go from the left
hand side to the middle just fine,

78
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,370
but on the right hand side
there is positively deviant
organization performance.

79
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,110
Now there are several important
implications of thinking
of the right hand side

80
00:05:08,111 --> 00:05:12,820
of that continuum. I refer to the
right hand side as abundance gaps.

81
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:18,160
I refer to left hand side as deficit gap,
problem solving gaps, challenge gaps.

82
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:23,320
Almost everything we study is focused
on the left hand side of the continuum.

83
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,150
On the right hand side,

84
00:05:25,151 --> 00:05:29,530
I refer to that end of the
continuum as a virtuous condition.

85
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:35,550
Now virtuousness as a concept is not
really acceptable in scholarly rigorous

86
00:05:35,891 --> 00:05:38,290
circumstances to religious,
too philosophical,

87
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,150
but in the original Latin and Greek
virtuousness just means the best of the

88
00:05:43,151 --> 00:05:44,050
human condition.

89
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:48,190
The highest aspirations we have
for sales is a virtuous state.

90
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,190
So when you were at your
very best at your peak,

91
00:05:51,191 --> 00:05:55,510
that's virtuousness see and music
virtuosos are the most or the best,

92
00:05:55,511 --> 00:05:59,660
most inspiring performers.
Virtuosity. In fact,

93
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:04,220
if the world was virtuous, there
would be no war, no poverty,

94
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,920
everybody be well educated.
It's the best we can imagine.

95
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:11,930
So the whole point of this
introduction is to get to this slide

96
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:17,960
that is to separate problem solving
deaths, the gaps from abundance scabs.

97
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:22,700
Here's the most important point.
When you focus on abundance gaps,

98
00:06:22,701 --> 00:06:26,660
you unleash something called
the heliotropic effect.

99
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:32,720
Do you know what the heliotropic effect
is? You do. You just don't know you do.

100
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:38,720
You put a plant in the window. Over time,
it will lean toward the light. All right,

101
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:42,860
which is an example of the heliotropic
effect, which is defined as follows.

102
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,150
Every living system,

103
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:49,180
everything alive has a tendency toward
the light and away from dark or toward

104
00:06:49,641 --> 00:06:52,880
positive energy, away from
negative energy. See, in nature,

105
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:56,300
the sun is the source of positive
energy is so life giving force,

106
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:02,410
so most accurately defined the heliotropic
effect is every living system has a

107
00:07:04,011 --> 00:07:08,900
tendency toward that which is life
giving and away from that which is life

108
00:07:08,901 --> 00:07:11,540
depleting. Now that
makes sense, doesn't it?

109
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:13,820
You think of evolutionary
processes over time,

110
00:07:13,821 --> 00:07:18,821
every species is attracted to that which
gives life and is repelled or avoids

111
00:07:19,341 --> 00:07:23,090
that which endangers or detracts
from life. Now, if that's true,

112
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,930
if every human being not to mention
every system, every living system,

113
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,730
every human being flourishes,

114
00:07:28,731 --> 00:07:33,680
and the presence of the positive and
languages in the presence of the negative,

115
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,040
it has big implications for
how we rear our children,

116
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:40,370
what kind of incentive systems
we have in organizations,

117
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,650
how we treat our colleagues,

118
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:46,010
how we manage the folks
who report to us and so on.

119
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:50,330
So what I want to do
is try to prove to you,

120
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:54,140
convince you that the
heliotropic effect exists.

121
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:57,170
And then if it does, then we're
going to talk about therefore what,

122
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,490
what's the relevance to Google,
to parents,

123
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,630
to colleagues, to friends. So just, um, I,

124
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm going to share with
you a very small percent,

125
00:08:08,001 --> 00:08:12,470
maybe one or 2% of the research available.
So very little,

126
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:15,890
but a few studies.
So here's one study.

127
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:20,950
Let's assume that I am a researcher
and you are all students.

128
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:26,240
But let's say you're 10 years old. Just
a normal, every do group of students.

129
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,690
I have three teachers who
are naive to the experiment.

130
00:08:29,691 --> 00:08:33,410
They don't know this an experiment, but
it is. So I say to teacher number one,

131
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:33,681
look,

132
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:37,730
we have a group of students in this
class are incredibly bright Iq points off

133
00:08:37,731 --> 00:08:40,010
the church.
They are really aggressive students.

134
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,940
It's going to take a great teacher to
help these kids flourish. Can you do it?

135
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,163
You Bet.

136
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:49,640
Teacher number two of group of students
in this class who I've enormous

137
00:08:49,641 --> 00:08:53,660
diversity of ability levels,
some really smart,

138
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:54,980
similarly challenged lots in,

139
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:59,730
it's going to take a great teacher to
handle real variety of ability levels.

140
00:08:59,731 --> 00:09:01,380
Can you do it?
Sure.

141
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,890
Teacher number three of a group of
students in this class who come from

142
00:09:04,891 --> 00:09:08,190
difficult backgrounds, failed a
lot, struggled, have not done well.

143
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:12,150
It's going to take a great teacher to
help these kids flourish. Can you do it?

144
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:16,190
Sure. Then I simply asked the
teachers to teach for one year.

145
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,250
Now the students are all the same.

146
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,240
I simply asked the teachers to
teach for one year, same subject.

147
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,531
At the end of the year,

148
00:09:22,531 --> 00:09:27,531
I give all the students a standardized
test and I find statistically significant

149
00:09:27,721 --> 00:09:30,300
differences in the results.
Who scores the best

150
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,290
above average scores?
Average scores below average scores of,

151
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,220
I think I'm teaching geniuses.
I am.

152
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,790
I've learned from US army generals
with whom I spend several days a year,

153
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,110
60% of the outcome of navy seals training,
army ranger training,

154
00:09:46,111 --> 00:09:49,470
special forces training is due to
the expectation of the instructor.

155
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,130
It's called the Pygmalion effect happens
with airline pilots all the way through

156
00:09:53,131 --> 00:09:56,850
preschoolers learning shapes and
colors. All right, that's one study.

157
00:09:56,851 --> 00:10:01,140
Another study done here on our campus
has been replicated several times,

158
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,760
so a physician puts a drop of liquid
at the bottom of your nostril in which

159
00:10:05,761 --> 00:10:10,410
there's cold virus, they call it
rhino virus. You breathe in the virus,

160
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,180
some people get sick and some people
don't and the question is will how do you

161
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:18,780
explain who succumbs to the
virus and gets a call versus not?

162
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,360
Turns out the temperature at the back
of your throat where you were sofic is

163
00:10:23,361 --> 00:10:23,610
neat,

164
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:27,420
meets your nasal passages a half a degree
difference in air temperature causes

165
00:10:27,421 --> 00:10:32,220
you to succumb or the virus versus be
resilient and your emotional state affects

166
00:10:32,221 --> 00:10:33,840
the temperature. Happy, optimistic,

167
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:38,841
positive people become six significantly
less often half as often as depressed,

168
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:40,320
angry,
cynical people.

169
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,820
But the classic study that illustrates
this is called the nun study.

170
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,800
It's a study of 678 Catholic
nuns living in a convent.

171
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:54,630
Now, this was originally designed
as an Alzheimer's disease study,

172
00:10:55,020 --> 00:11:00,020
so these women were between the ages
of 75 and 104 and some of them and

173
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:04,410
Alzheimer's disease, but see they
have the same diet, same regimen,

174
00:11:04,411 --> 00:11:08,310
same environment. You can control
for a lot of factors. Well,

175
00:11:08,311 --> 00:11:11,310
there was a side finding that emerged
from that research and here it is.

176
00:11:11,311 --> 00:11:16,311
I was especially interesting to me they
found the journals or diaries of 180 of

177
00:11:17,971 --> 00:11:22,110
these women when they entered
the convent 60 years before.

178
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,490
Some of these women are saying
things like this in their journal.

179
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,940
This is a culmination of my life's dream.
I'm so happy to enter the order.

180
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,710
This is such a blessing. Some are saying
this is going to be a real challenge,

181
00:11:34,711 --> 00:11:37,740
going to be a sacrifice, going to
be difficult, but I'm committed.

182
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,330
I'm going to follow through difference.
They simply put nuns in two groups,

183
00:11:42,331 --> 00:11:45,420
depending on which type of type
of journal they were keeping.

184
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:50,280
Then the study was at the end of 60 years,

185
00:11:50,281 --> 00:11:53,740
they simply counted the number
of nuns alive in each group.

186
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,530
Now,
these numbers aren't precise,

187
00:11:56,531 --> 00:12:00,160
but they are very close and they represent
the difference of the 90 nuns in the

188
00:12:00,161 --> 00:12:03,790
first group. 70 real live of the
90 [inaudible] in the second group,

189
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,070
20 were alive and at every decade.

190
00:12:06,071 --> 00:12:08,140
There's a significant
difference in mortality rates.

191
00:12:08,141 --> 00:12:12,190
13 years difference as it turns out,
I mean, you live longer on that happy,

192
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:16,060
optimistic, positive
perspective. Now the study,

193
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,430
let's assume that for a minute,

194
00:12:18,431 --> 00:12:23,410
I'm interested in having all of you become
better bowlers. B. O w. L. All right,

195
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,910
and I'm so committed to this. I'm going
to give you a big incentive. In fact,

196
00:12:27,911 --> 00:12:28,271
my power,

197
00:12:28,271 --> 00:12:33,130
I'll give you $1,000 if you can improve
your bowling score by an average of 10

198
00:12:33,131 --> 00:12:36,610
pins. All right? Pretty good
incentive. The challenges,

199
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,870
I'm going to give you only 30 days,
so we got to get a baseline.

200
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,060
We're all going to go
down and bowl three games.

201
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,020
I'm going to film you as
you bowl then for you folks.

202
00:12:47,021 --> 00:12:48,550
I'm going to show you
when you were bullying.

203
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:52,090
I'm going to show you only when you made
strikes and spares when you're knocked

204
00:12:52,091 --> 00:12:55,750
all the pins down. Okay? I'm going
to show you when you were bullying.

205
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,930
I'm going to show you only when you
did not make strikes and spares,

206
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:02,110
so square up. Work on your
approach. Try to improve. All right?

207
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:07,180
30 days later we come back together. We
all go down and bowl. Three more games.

208
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,730
Some of you get the money
who'd get the money?

209
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,860
These folks who get the money.
The question is why?

210
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,690
Why would these folks do better?

211
00:13:16,691 --> 00:13:20,650
Just by watching themselves make strikes
versus these who are trying to improve.

212
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,130
That's kind of easy and
then getting comfortable.

213
00:13:24,131 --> 00:13:28,100
I'm getting confident and stuff except
think about this the first time you're

214
00:13:28,101 --> 00:13:30,790
not in played basketball.
Then she mostly miss.

215
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:36,220
What didn't you learn how to miss? Because
most of the data's coming back wrong.

216
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:40,420
First time when the golf
course went this way, this way,

217
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:45,490
first time in a tennis court bounced off
your racket went over there in the net.

218
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,470
Why didn't you learn how to do it wrong?

219
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,710
The answer is heliotropic effect.

220
00:13:50,711 --> 00:13:54,640
Inherent in your DNA is a
tendency to learn the positive.

221
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:58,030
If you didn't, you wouldn't be
this old. You would've died before.

222
00:13:58,031 --> 00:14:01,180
Now you would not have adapted
so you don't have to choose.

223
00:14:01,181 --> 00:14:03,160
I'm going to show you in a minute.
You don't have to choose.

224
00:14:03,161 --> 00:14:06,880
You have an inherent inclination.
It is in your DNA.

225
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,610
I showed you a picture of
a cell and that last slide,

226
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:13,960
it's at every cell in your
body has receptors to light.

227
00:14:13,961 --> 00:14:16,420
When it's turned transforms
into life giving energy.

228
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:19,240
It's at the cellular DNA level.

229
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,940
The heliotropic effect has an n,
eh,

230
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,050
creates an inclination in all
of us toward the positive.

231
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:30,640
I'll show you some more data and just
a minute. One more. One more study.

232
00:14:30,641 --> 00:14:32,860
I used to do this in my classes.
I don't do it anymore,

233
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,540
but it's done all over the world.

234
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:39,700
That's assume all of you are in my Mba
class at the University of Michigan and I

235
00:14:39,701 --> 00:14:41,590
say to you, okay, students in my class,

236
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:46,930
you are required to keep a journal and
you have to write in your journal every

237
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:48,730
day, okay? However,

238
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:52,970
you folks every day are going to write
in your journal three things for which

239
00:14:52,971 --> 00:14:54,890
you're grateful.
All right,

240
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,030
so five minutes before
you go to bed tonight,

241
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,030
just write down the three best
things that happened here.

242
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,820
Today are three things
for which you're grateful.

243
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:06,140
You write down three events or three
things that were frustrating or problems

244
00:15:06,141 --> 00:15:10,700
you faced, so I got a journal group.
I've got a gratitude journal group.

245
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:14,000
All right. Now at the end of the
semester, I'm going to do several studies.

246
00:15:14,001 --> 00:15:17,450
All of these studies are published.
For example,

247
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:22,100
I'm going to give all of you a flu shot.
Seven days later.

248
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:25,340
I'm going to test for the number
of antibodies in your system.

249
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:30,740
You're going to be healthier in seven
days detectable. He physically healthier,

250
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:34,880
more antibodies in your body.
Then are you now look,

251
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,200
this is a gratitude journal.

252
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:39,530
It's putting yourself in a virtuous or
in this case and gratitude condition.

253
00:15:39,531 --> 00:15:43,670
Once a day I can get a
physical difference. This
is not something difficult.

254
00:15:43,671 --> 00:15:48,080
This is not losing weight or giving up
coffee or training for a marathon or

255
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:52,280
something. This is put yourself
in a virtuous condition. Another,

256
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:57,060
I give you a mental acuity test. What's
that? You have to memorize information.

257
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,550
You have to remember information.

258
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,420
You have to come up with sophisticated
decision rules for complex data,

259
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:07,520
more mental acuity here than here.
I can affect your test scores.

260
00:16:07,521 --> 00:16:11,870
I'm going to show you in a minute. I
give you a creativity task. What's that?

261
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:12,950
Well,

262
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:17,360
think of all the things you can use
this for or a ping pong ball or a brick.

263
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:21,290
More ideas here and a broader
variety of ideas here.

264
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:24,410
It's called mental
flexibility here than here.

265
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,180
This is a gratitude journal. This is,
this is a pretty easy intervention.

266
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:33,890
There's a study done about six months
ago now as the first they say claim its

267
00:16:33,891 --> 00:16:37,820
own. Only one of its kind.
I can detect if you have,

268
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,790
if you have heart disease and
the basis of blood chemistry.

269
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:45,020
I'm not a medical doctor, so I don't
know how that works. But that's,

270
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,520
that's apparently the case.

271
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:51,910
So what they did is took heart disease
patients and he simply put them in two

272
00:16:52,251 --> 00:16:54,260
groups once a control group.
The other one,

273
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:58,520
they asked them to keep gratitude
journals for eight weeks every day.

274
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,990
At the end of eight weeks,
they simply tested blood chemistry.

275
00:17:02,991 --> 00:17:05,870
Those people are keeping gratitude.
Journals were healthier,

276
00:17:05,871 --> 00:17:10,670
their blood chemistry was healthier
than those who did not. I mean,

277
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:15,590
they said, holy cow, first study of
its kind to show that kind of evidence.

278
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,580
And then I've learned
from these military folks,

279
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:22,760
if you lose a spouse to death or divorce,

280
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,270
zero deep depression,
six months later here,

281
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:29,870
30% deep depression here six months later.

282
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:35,440
So the whole notion is this virtuous
positive practices has physical

283
00:17:35,481 --> 00:17:40,250
differences, cognitive differences,
academic differences and so on.

284
00:17:40,251 --> 00:17:43,730
I'll show you some more.
Um, earlier this year,

285
00:17:43,731 --> 00:17:45,280
I was on a group of,

286
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:50,560
I had a chance to select the best doctoral
dissertation done in the plant on the

287
00:17:52,801 --> 00:17:54,630
planet in this general area.

288
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:59,660
This is the winner done by guy who went
to Butan and he selected high schools,

289
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:05,100
so he had 11 high schools in
an experimental condition,

290
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:08,640
nine high schools in a control condition
would that mean in 11 high schools?

291
00:18:08,641 --> 00:18:13,641
He changed the curriculum so students
were exposed to virtuousness positive

292
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,380
practices,
positivity and so on.

293
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,140
He then measured one year
later and then two years later,

294
00:18:22,141 --> 00:18:26,430
simply a measure of wellbeing. How you
doing? You're feeling good about yourself.

295
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,820
Do you like school? You're getting along
with your friends and so on. Wellbeing,

296
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:34,050
significant improvement in those,
exposed to this positive stuff.

297
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:37,260
Then here was the real surprise.

298
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:42,630
He then measured scores
on standardized tests.

299
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:48,060
Now in America that would be sat,
act tests, significant differences.

300
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:51,720
A year later, two years later,
academically they perform better.

301
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,390
The only differences are getting
exposed to positive practices.

302
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,980
Then you went to Mexico,

303
00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:00,360
approximately 70,000
students in that study.

304
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,170
That is 35 high schools in each condition,
experimental condition,

305
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:08,070
control condition, significant
improvement, wellbeing,

306
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:11,400
academic performance.
Then he went to Peru,

307
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,070
700,000 students,

308
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:19,200
347 schools in each condition.
Significant differences,

309
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,690
and we can affect your test scores.
I mean,

310
00:19:21,691 --> 00:19:26,310
virtuousness actually has an
impact. And here's, here's why.

311
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,110
There are interesting studies
done of heart rhythms.

312
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:36,720
So for example, I have a good friend
at an organization called heart math.

313
00:19:36,721 --> 00:19:41,040
They study heart rhythms in
a frustrated, angry, upset,

314
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:45,540
depressed condition.
Your heart rhythms are very unpredictable.

315
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:50,550
Go like this. In a positive
virtuous state, like for example,

316
00:19:50,551 --> 00:19:55,410
inducing gratitude. Your heart rhythms go
like this. You don't have to choose it.

317
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,790
It's heliotropic.
So now you know why after 60 years,

318
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:03,540
some nuns are alive in some are dead.
Their heart just works better.

319
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:08,730
Another study,
they simply ask people to contemplate,

320
00:20:08,731 --> 00:20:10,050
ponder a positive,

321
00:20:10,051 --> 00:20:13,800
optimistic future versus a
neutral or negative future.

322
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,750
So now I have you in a mental set.

323
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:19,800
Now I'm going to put you through
an MRI machine and scan your brain.

324
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,500
Turns out those in the positive,

325
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:27,501
optimistic mental set had more areas
of your brain activated and have those

326
00:20:29,131 --> 00:20:32,250
activated. They're activated to
a great extent, greater extent.

327
00:20:32,251 --> 00:20:35,460
You literally are smarter in
that positive virtuous state.

328
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:39,780
You don't have to choose it.
It's heliotropic your brain works better.

329
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,910
And that virtuous positive state,

330
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:46,560
sorry I don't have these slides
to show you a another study.

331
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,660
The, excuse me, the

332
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,453
um,

333
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:59,770
there was a study done of
a kidney dialysis patients,

334
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:05,440
people who were hooked up to a kidney
dialysis machine so they can't go

335
00:21:05,441 --> 00:21:10,080
anywhere. And the question
is, um, I'm either,

336
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:15,170
the assignment was we want some of you
to receive a phone call from other people

337
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,630
expressing love,
support and concern.

338
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:23,470
And we doubled that is you're going to
receive a phone call for some people and

339
00:21:23,471 --> 00:21:27,070
for some people we want you to
place a phone call expressing love,

340
00:21:27,071 --> 00:21:30,400
support and concern.
At the end of that period of time.

341
00:21:30,401 --> 00:21:32,320
At the end of a two year period of time,

342
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:34,900
those people who had placed a phone call,

343
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,590
those people who had received support
and love and concern from other people

344
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:43,120
were significantly better off than
those who did not. And here's the,

345
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:48,130
here's the explanation for them.
If you are significantly overweight,

346
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:53,340
the probability of dying early is
20% if you are an excessive drinker,

347
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,490
probably dying early,

348
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:02,700
30% my MBA students always want to know
what the definition of excessive means.

349
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:07,600
If you're a smoker,
probability of dying early,

350
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:12,690
50% if you are in poor
social relationships,

351
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:15,340
probably of dying early,

352
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:19,390
70% bad social relationships,
Trump,

353
00:22:19,391 --> 00:22:21,850
the physical factors we
normally pay attention to.

354
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:27,390
I mean it matters a lot and there's a
whole bunch of research that suggests that

355
00:22:27,401 --> 00:22:30,970
that's the case. If you're in a
conflicting, difficult relationship,

356
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,350
you're going to have a hard time.

357
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:37,990
That is your body for many reasons is not
going to be, it's not going to do well.

358
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,360
All right,
well

359
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:46,780
the question is why is that?
Well,

360
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:51,640
most of the time we say, well
it's because um, you know,

361
00:22:51,641 --> 00:22:54,400
I'm getting my needs met. I
mean, I want to be popular. I,

362
00:22:54,401 --> 00:22:57,790
it feels good to have somebody care
for me and so on, except that's not,

363
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,430
that's not the explanation.
Here's the explanation.

364
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:05,230
A and these studies were all done in our,
in our university.

365
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,600
So I have a colleague who's
a psychologist who, um,

366
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:13,270
took entering freshmen at the
interview or University of Michigan.

367
00:23:13,271 --> 00:23:15,340
These are all 17, 18, 19 year old kids.

368
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,070
She simply asked them to identify
their goals for the year.

369
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,950
Now everyone has lots of goals,

370
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,640
but she categorized the
goals into two types.

371
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:28,810
One type recalled achievement
goals. I want a good, good grades,

372
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:31,750
want to be popular. I want a girlfriend,
I want to make the team and so on.

373
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:34,780
The other kind of goal was
called contribution goals.

374
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:36,310
I want to make a difference.

375
00:23:36,311 --> 00:23:38,620
I want to have something get better
because of what I've contributed.

376
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:44,020
Now she put people into groups depending
on which type of goal was dominant.

377
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:50,110
Then the study was you simply followed
these students for a approximately a year

378
00:23:50,781 --> 00:23:54,710
academic year measuring things like how
well they get along with her roommates,

379
00:23:55,490 --> 00:24:00,140
how many minor physiological symptoms they
experienced, the cold headache, nausea,

380
00:24:00,141 --> 00:24:03,740
flew, cramps, stuff like that.
How many times they miss class,

381
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,020
what their grade point average was,

382
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,040
how many times they made the team or got
elected to a club office or something.

383
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:12,140
See social factors,
academic factors,

384
00:24:12,141 --> 00:24:15,770
physical factors on
every single dimension.

385
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:20,870
Contribution, goals, trumped achievement
goals in predicting performance.

386
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:25,730
It's what they contributed more
than what they got. Second,

387
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,111
uh,

388
00:24:27,111 --> 00:24:32,060
this is one of my favorite studies is
a study of multiple sclerosis patients.

389
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,221
These folks,

390
00:24:34,221 --> 00:24:38,720
half of them were assigned to place
a phone call once a week to somebody.

391
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:42,950
Half of them were asked to receive a
phone call from somebody once a week,

392
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:46,760
two years later they measured wellbeing.

393
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,110
You can see on the right hand side of
this slide, self efficacy, confidence,

394
00:24:51,111 --> 00:24:54,680
competence, physical
activity, hope, depression.

395
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:00,760
Those who placed the phone call or eight
times healthier at the end of two years

396
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,230
than those who received the phone call.

397
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:07,550
It was the contribution because
them to flourish physically.

398
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:11,480
Um, you know, um,

399
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:16,550
borders bookstore used to be in Anarbor
now bankrupt world's largest book seller.

400
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:19,520
While they were in business,
they created the borders foundation.

401
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:23,030
The borders foundation was simply a
unit within borders where you could

402
00:25:23,031 --> 00:25:26,960
contribute money and if people had a
sick child or an accident or needed

403
00:25:26,961 --> 00:25:29,630
financial support,
you could apply to the borders foundation.

404
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:35,020
Get results are get a financial support.
When of our doctoral students did it,

405
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:35,751
did a study,

406
00:25:35,751 --> 00:25:40,250
the hypothesis of which was if you
have received money from the borders

407
00:25:40,251 --> 00:25:44,420
foundation, loyalty, commitment,
engagement will go sky high.

408
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,890
It turns out no difference if you receive
money, if you hadn't received money,

409
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:49,973
didn't matter.

410
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:54,410
What did matter was the opportunity to
contribute to the borders foundation.

411
00:25:54,411 --> 00:25:58,370
If you had given money to the borders
foundation, commitment, loyalty,

412
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,490
skyhigh borders is bankrupt.

413
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:05,510
The Borders Foundation will not die.
Still exists.

414
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:08,180
Now they're trying to get mom and pop
bookstores around the country to join who

415
00:26:08,181 --> 00:26:09,260
don't have safety nets.

416
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:14,390
People will not stop giving if they
have a chance to give turns out.

417
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:17,960
Contribution in relationships
is the predictor.

418
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:22,940
So when we think about positive
leadership, it's not, I want to be famous,

419
00:26:22,941 --> 00:26:25,550
I want to get,
make sure you give me things.

420
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:30,020
It rather is what can I contribute to
the wellbeing or flourishing of other

421
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:30,800
people?

422
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,520
And there's a whole bunch of ways to
think about doing that because almost all

423
00:26:34,521 --> 00:26:39,140
organizations, when you do
especially well give you stuff,

424
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:43,010
you given him financial incentive,
you get your picture on the wall,

425
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:47,490
gives you some recognition and a
newsletter. You, you're a receiver.

426
00:26:47,491 --> 00:26:52,260
Turns out if you have an opportunity
to give or contribute to somebody else,

427
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:57,420
that's a much better incentive. Like for
example, if mark does especially well,

428
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:00,810
I'm going to ask him to coach somebody
else because they need to become as good

429
00:27:00,811 --> 00:27:04,590
as he is. That is his reward as
he get a chance to teach or coach.

430
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:09,710
That's just one example of Manny
that you can use to contribute in

431
00:27:09,811 --> 00:27:12,960
organizations. Okay, and
I'm going to skip these now.

432
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:17,220
The question is,
all right,

433
00:27:17,221 --> 00:27:19,470
I got the brainwaves camera
and I got the heart rhythms,

434
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,870
rhythms and all that stuff.
Okay? But wait a minute.

435
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:27,440
Organizations are much more
complex than our individuals.

436
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:30,150
That as you can get a bunch
of happy people together,

437
00:27:30,151 --> 00:27:33,930
does not make for a great organization.
So the question is,

438
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:38,640
does this actually work in organizations
when I'm held accountable for

439
00:27:38,641 --> 00:27:43,170
profitability and productivity and quality
and customer satisfaction and so on.

440
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:47,970
That's been my research for 15 years.
That's been the question. Yeah,

441
00:27:47,971 --> 00:27:52,650
but does it work in organizations?
Turns out after 15 years.

442
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:57,830
The bottom line is if you implement
in an organization positive practices,

443
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,500
we haven't talked about
what that is at all,

444
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:07,260
but virtuous practices,
compassion, kindness,

445
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,910
uh, forgiveness, gratitude and so on,

446
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,410
you will get higher
levels of profitability.

447
00:28:16,411 --> 00:28:18,480
You make more money by
far than the industry.

448
00:28:18,481 --> 00:28:22,830
Average productivity is
significantly improved.

449
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:26,970
Quality goes up, fewer errors, fewer,
fewer, less waste, fewer mistakes,

450
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,830
innovation, new product ideas, creativity,

451
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:36,990
all improve the scores on creativity
go up, customer satisfaction,

452
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:40,110
customer loyalty,
customer retention goes up,

453
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:45,060
employee satisfaction and employee
retention. I'll go up. That is,

454
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,860
that's what you're held accountable for.

455
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:51,510
All of those are significantly improved
when you implement positive practices.

456
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:55,860
I'm going to not show you
hardly any of their search,

457
00:28:55,861 --> 00:28:57,810
but let me just give
you a couple of studies.

458
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:04,140
One of the most surprising studies is
this one because we said where is the

459
00:29:04,141 --> 00:29:08,880
least likely place anybody
would care about this? Positive,

460
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:13,680
virtuous, Saccharin, sweet,
soupy, syrupy touchy,

461
00:29:13,681 --> 00:29:18,600
feely,
naive pollyannish stuff.

462
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,060
Likely Wall Street.

463
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:25,410
I mean if I got $100 million invested
in that portfolio and I'm going to hedge

464
00:29:25,411 --> 00:29:28,290
fund, I want to know if it's going
up or down cause I got one goal.

465
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:32,910
Show me the money. That's all
I care about. I don't care
if you treat people well.

466
00:29:32,911 --> 00:29:35,820
I don't care if you downsize, I don't
care if you, I don't care what you do.

467
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,140
I want to return.

468
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:42,620
So it picked 40 firms when
they implemented positive
practice or some did better

469
00:29:42,731 --> 00:29:44,980
than others. Should we measured
change or in other words,

470
00:29:44,981 --> 00:29:48,310
how are you getting better? You're getting
worse. You're staying in the shame.

471
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,840
When organizations improved,
gotten more and more virtuous,

472
00:29:52,841 --> 00:29:57,841
essentially we could account for
almost 50% 0.45% 45% of their financial

473
00:30:01,961 --> 00:30:03,430
performance. Now, I dunno,

474
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:08,460
anything that predicts Wall
Street performance by 45%
but we could plus a bunch

475
00:30:09,431 --> 00:30:12,300
of other things to turn over and you know,

476
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,870
satisfaction and all
those kinds of things.

477
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:18,900
That is even in the least likely
a most hostile environment.

478
00:30:19,061 --> 00:30:23,110
You can imagine positive performance has
paid off and then in healthcare you'd

479
00:30:23,111 --> 00:30:25,660
sort of expect that,
but over a two year period of time,

480
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:30,610
double digit improvement where the
industry average is one or 2% double digit

481
00:30:30,611 --> 00:30:35,110
improvement on these various dimensions
that really count that people want to

482
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,273
improve.

483
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:41,500
So the whole point is with only a very
small sampling of the information,

484
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:47,020
what we know is actually positive
practices pay off physically,

485
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:51,250
cognitively, socially, and they pay off.

486
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:55,540
Organizationally when you
implement positive practices,
organizations do better.

487
00:30:56,060 --> 00:31:00,520
Where we improve what we want, what
we're held accountable for, oh,

488
00:31:00,521 --> 00:31:01,630
we want to improve.
All right,

489
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,710
there's a bunch of resources that are
available if you want to get them.

490
00:31:05,711 --> 00:31:10,570
There's a website that we have for our
research center where there's long lists

491
00:31:10,571 --> 00:31:15,571
of videos and references and papers and
syllabi for courses and all those kinds

492
00:31:18,881 --> 00:31:19,714
of things.

493
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:24,740
And that I'm going to stop
here because I've just, uh,

494
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:29,680
I've just talked for 32
minutes. Questions, comments,

495
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:32,020
yeah,
buts anything on your mind.

496
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,390
Hey, my name is Dominique. Um,

497
00:31:38,391 --> 00:31:42,680
and I do have a question about if
you've ever stood a study on Google.

498
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:47,300
I feel like all of the brackets you talked
about and positive leadership and are

499
00:31:47,301 --> 00:31:51,890
quite a few of our pillars. I think our
senior leadership takes pretty seriously.

500
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,030
Have you ever looked at a study on here?
Never

501
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:57,990
done it. I've never done a study on
Google. I'd love to. Just was curious.

502
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:01,750
I
read a lot.

503
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:06,420
I would like to get my prediction.
I'll finish the thought.

504
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:11,540
My prediction is that there are
pockets that are spectacular,

505
00:32:12,061 --> 00:32:16,560
extraordinary and pockets that are,
could be improved, I would guess.

506
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,830
And one of the nice things about starting
Google is to try to find out where

507
00:32:19,831 --> 00:32:24,831
those are and what the practices are
specifically here that would create the

508
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:28,560
spectacular performance. Um, uh,

509
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:33,030
I am so far there is no disconfirming
evidence that this pays off and

510
00:32:33,031 --> 00:32:37,320
organizations so far I'm not going to
disconfirming evidence about anything but

511
00:32:37,321 --> 00:32:39,000
not this.
Thanks.

512
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:42,550
First of all, thank you for coming
out here and speaking to us. Um,

513
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:46,000
I was wondering if you had a similar
to the question about Google,

514
00:32:46,001 --> 00:32:47,130
but have you done any research or,

515
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:50,460
but we're on like nonprofits
and those who work there, um,

516
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:54,340
or maybe are in some sort
of service jobs such as, um,

517
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:58,600
nursing or fire firemen, you
know, just helping the community.

518
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:00,990
Yeah,
that's really good question.

519
00:33:00,991 --> 00:33:05,991
How about not for profits and turns out
we've done a lot of work in the f and

520
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:07,650
the following industries.

521
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:12,720
There's a lot of work in education that
is implementing these positive practices,

522
00:33:12,721 --> 00:33:16,200
changes, test scores, changes,
academic performance and so on.

523
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,970
We've done a lot of work in healthcare.

524
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,350
I showed you one little quick study of
that, uh, of that. And, and hospitals.

525
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:27,570
We've done a lot of work in the
national intelligence agencies, CIA,

526
00:33:27,571 --> 00:33:31,350
FBI, Nsa, Dia, 16 agencies.

527
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:37,010
See you can't manufacture enough
bullets to keep the world safe Kenyon.

528
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,560
So they've gotta be some alternatives.
They get it.

529
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:46,250
And it's been pretty inspirational to me
to see how the FBI is trying to figure

530
00:33:46,351 --> 00:33:50,460
out a way to implement positive practices
or positive leadership. You know,

531
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,440
so that's another military army generals,
especially US army generals.

532
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:58,560
I'm not working on any, you know, the
noncommissioned officers and so on.

533
00:33:58,561 --> 00:34:03,320
But from the one, two, three, four
star level, boy, I tell you what their,

534
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,090
um,

535
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:09,090
I'm impressed with them from
their perspective setting
strategy for the world.

536
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,190
This resonates and matters.

537
00:34:11,191 --> 00:34:14,700
So they've been working on this for
seven or eight or nine years, you know,

538
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:17,430
this whole topic.
Um,

539
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:21,480
so that we did a big
study of nursing nurses,

540
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:26,780
similar kind of outcome with the
nursing care and probably some others,

541
00:34:26,881 --> 00:34:31,260
but there's a lot of not for
profit, um, work that's being done.
