So people from all walks of
life. Uh, he's a crypto expert,

10
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:51,240
but he likes to remind people
that that's not all. He's about a,

11
00:00:51,241 --> 00:00:55,280
that is all the rage right now. Um, and
he does an awesome class on masterclass.

Um, so without further ado,

14
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,670
let's start this interview. I really
appreciate you coming here, James.

15
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,400
Jessie, I can't tell you how much I'm
appreciative of being invited here.

16
00:01:09,401 --> 00:01:11,140
So my favorite company

17
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:13,340
in the world.
Absolutely.

18
00:01:13,341 --> 00:01:17,270
And you apparently have a pretty good
story when it comes to Google, right?

19
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,630
Well,
well,

20
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,850
so one time I started this company
and I'm always in the mode.

21
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,970
As soon as I start a
company I want to sell it,

22
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,670
which is really kind of not
a good philosophy to have.

23
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,480
But unfortunately that's my philosophy.
And uh,

24
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:38,490
so the incident the company started,
I basically went around to every company,

25
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:43,050
um, AOL, Yahoo, Google,
Forbes Interactive Corp,

26
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:47,280
and it was kind of like a social media
site for people interested in investing.

27
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,680
And I basically say we're for sale.

28
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,040
Google finance was just
starting at the time.

29
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,590
I don't even know what's
happening now with Google finance,

30
00:01:55,591 --> 00:01:57,740
but Google finance was, uh, uh,

31
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,810
starting at the time and I met with
them in New York and it was great.

32
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,140
Like it was in this conference
room where then it goes,

33
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:10,620
it went right into a video screen
where the people in San Francisco,

34
00:02:10,621 --> 00:02:13,710
we're on the other side.
So it felt like one big conference table.

35
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,940
And I just remember walking into
Google in New York and people were

36
00:02:17,941 --> 00:02:22,770
skateboarding around.
There was like chefs making lunch.

37
00:02:22,771 --> 00:02:25,830
There are people getting haircuts.
There was like everybody,

38
00:02:25,831 --> 00:02:30,630
everybody had like three monitors
are crazy monitors and I just,

39
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:35,760
I'm like, oh my gosh, I really want to be
here. Like I want to come to work here.

40
00:02:35,761 --> 00:02:40,761
I hadn't had a job in 12 years at that
point and I just really like wanted to

41
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,630
just hang out there.

42
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,900
And I remember waking up at two in the
morning and I had that feeling like you

43
00:02:48,211 --> 00:02:51,690
get when you're on your, your first
high school date with a big crush.

44
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:56,460
And I had this feeling like, oh my
gosh, I love Google. And so I wrote,

45
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:01,600
I think it was a Katie Jacob Stanton was
running, um, Google finance at the time.

46
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,420
She ended up, she ended up working
for Obama then working at Twitter.

47
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:08,470
I don't know where she is now.
Um, I wrote her and I said,

48
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:11,470
I really love the meeting.
I love Google.

49
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,990
I can't wait to our next conversation.

50
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,950
It's like everything you would write
as like after your high school crush,

51
00:03:17,951 --> 00:03:21,340
first date. I wrote in
this email like, you know,

52
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:25,690
like hours after I met them
and she never wrote back.

53
00:03:25,691 --> 00:03:27,570
I never heard from them again and,
but,

54
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,550
which is typical loss of that
high swell first date. By the way,

55
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:31,870
I never had a first date in high school.

56
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:33,910
I had a first day when I
was in college finally.

57
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:37,840
But I'm imagining that's what I be like
if he had a first dating in high school.

58
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,410
So that's my goal.
We'll set bay.

59
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:45,770
Yeah. Well anytime you want to come hang
out and just, just let us know. Great.

60
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,460
Um, so, uh,

61
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:50,700
I want to just get into your background
a little bit just for some context, uh,

62
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,240
for, for the people that
don't know out there and, uh,

63
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,670
you're very kind of vulnerable and open
about the adversity you've faced in your

64
00:03:56,671 --> 00:04:01,640
adult life. But take us back to the
beginning. Give us, give us like a, a bio,

65
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,573
give us everything.

66
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:07,390
Sure. So, uh, I'll, I'll
speed it, speed through it,

67
00:04:07,391 --> 00:04:10,450
but I was a technologist at heart.

68
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:15,250
I majored in computer science. I went
to graduate school, Computer Science.

69
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,260
Um, in fact, the last time I was
on this campus, I visited, uh, uh,

70
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:24,730
next Grad school classmate of mine,
which was astro teller who runs, uh,

71
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,190
I don't know what it's called.
That was Google x. Then.

72
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:32,260
I don't know what he's going to ask. The
moonshot moonshot. A. Yeah. So, uh, uh,

73
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:36,310
uh, and then I, and then I
got really interested in,

74
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:41,080
in writing. I wrote a
four failed novels, uh,

75
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,870
which is, I don't know where they are
now. They're thrown out somewhere.

76
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:48,250
And I decided I wanted to be
an entertainment industry.

77
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:52,450
So I went to work for Hbo in New York.
And uh,

78
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:56,860
from that I was able to combine
several interests at once.

79
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,040
I knew technology, I knew how to
build websites in the mid nineties.

80
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,020
No one else knew how to build them.
So I,

81
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,000
but I was also in the
entertainment industry.

82
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:09,270
So I started a company that focused on
building a very particular niche sort of

83
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,200
websites. So you could probably
even tell what kind of websites,

84
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:19,130
just by the way I look, but every,
almost all of our websites where uh,

85
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,940
uh, the websites of
gangster rap record labels.

86
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,930
So that's supposed to be
a little bit funny. Um,

87
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,240
well we did bad boy records, loud
records, the source magazine,

88
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:32,330
that's where records jive records and um,

89
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,950
American express.com which most people
don't know is actually a gangsta rap

90
00:05:35,951 --> 00:05:40,951
record label and a timewarner.com
we did miramax.com,

91
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,470
uh, with where I'm on. Harvey
Weinstein was running it and we did um,

92
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:47,710
kind of edit.
It was funny.

93
00:05:47,711 --> 00:05:51,250
We did kind of edison.com [inaudible]
website and then we made an internal

94
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:54,940
website for them to keep
track of their y two k stuff.

95
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,100
And I remember asking them
and one of the meetings,

96
00:05:58,101 --> 00:06:02,930
where are you guys going to be
during, you know, on December 31st,

97
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:07,370
1999 and they were 100% of them was
like where we are going to be long,

98
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:12,110
far away from New York City then because
they had no faith in their abilities to

99
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,950
keep the electricity going on y
two k but everything was fine.

100
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:20,760
So they didn't know anything.
But so I, so I, I started that,

101
00:06:20,761 --> 00:06:25,700
that company we grew pretty fast and
then during the boom of, uh, you know,

102
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:28,100
everybody was acquiring an IPO and so on.

103
00:06:28,101 --> 00:06:30,440
So we sold the company as I remember my,

104
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:35,360
my sister who was in like junior high
school at the time was learning how to

105
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:40,160
build websites at that point. And I
was thinking to myself, oh my gosh,

106
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:45,580
I charge HBO $75,000 to do a three
page website about Dennis Miller.

107
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,520
And now my lip,

108
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:52,280
my junior high school sister is learning
how to build websites so that this

109
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:53,240
business is going down,

110
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:57,020
this industry is going downhill and within
probably within three or four years,

111
00:06:57,021 --> 00:07:00,610
every single business and that
industry was bankrupt and a,

112
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,910
so I sold that company
and started a VC fund,

113
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,140
started a Hedge Fund II.
Along the way.

114
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,480
I went totally broke. So I
sold this company, cashed out.

115
00:07:14,481 --> 00:07:18,800
It wasn't like I had paper cashed out
for enough money for the next three

116
00:07:18,801 --> 00:07:23,690
generations of my kids, grandkids,
great grandkids could live,

117
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:28,990
and then I managed to spend every
single dime like there was one summer.

118
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:33,560
It was really, it was really
unbelievable. Then again,

119
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:38,590
it wasn't like on paper there was one
summer I probably lost $1 million a week

120
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:44,410
and then at the end of it I go to my ATM
machine and I had $143 left in my bank

121
00:07:44,841 --> 00:07:47,540
account. So then I, I, I,

122
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:52,310
I lost all this money and so I wrote some
software to figure out why did I lose

123
00:07:52,311 --> 00:07:57,290
this money? I modeled, I did all
sorts of statistical pattern modeling,

124
00:07:57,291 --> 00:08:02,291
pattern recognition on the stock market
over the past 60 years and started

125
00:08:03,681 --> 00:08:06,080
trading based on,
on this software that I wrote,

126
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,260
built up a hedge fund than
a fund of hedge funds.

127
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:14,090
Then I built this kind of
social media site for investing,

128
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:19,430
uh, sold that. I started another
hedge fund after that. Um,

129
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:23,510
and then gradually I started doing
more and more angel investing because I

130
00:08:23,511 --> 00:08:28,511
realized I really couldn't handle day
trading and hedge fund investing was so

131
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,470
stressful for me in every way.

132
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:34,970
I remember I would put on a trade and,
and there were,

133
00:08:34,971 --> 00:08:39,710
the trade would instantly go against me
sometimes even if like every software

134
00:08:39,711 --> 00:08:43,070
was shouting it and I thought I could
outsource my emotions. So the software,

135
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,420
but I was still get so stressed like
I would, I would go across the street,

136
00:08:47,421 --> 00:08:50,440
there was a church across from my
house and I go across the street,

137
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:54,920
no one would be in the church and I would
literally go right up to the statue of

138
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:59,910
Jesus and I pray,
please make s and p futures go up.

139
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,960
I'll do anything. And I'm
Jewish, so I'm in the car.

140
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:09,540
It just wouldn't work out.
And um,

141
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,090
and so eventually I did
a fund of hedge funds,

142
00:09:12,091 --> 00:09:16,530
but I decided to get out of the hedge
fund space and I focus more on angel

143
00:09:16,531 --> 00:09:19,530
investing, which was, which
was much easier, not easier,

144
00:09:19,531 --> 00:09:22,650
but much more relaxing
for me. And then I, I,

145
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,850
I had previously written a bunch
of books in the finance space,

146
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,940
but then suddenly I
started writing about my,

147
00:09:29,941 --> 00:09:33,900
as around 2010 I started writing about
the things I was feeling vulnerable about

148
00:09:33,901 --> 00:09:37,290
and the things I was scared
about it. And I realized, look,

149
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,850
this is much more important to people.

150
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:43,740
Not everybody cares whether apple is
a better investment than Microsoft.

151
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:49,020
Uh, but everybody goes through periods
in their life where they don't know what

152
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:52,020
they're doing. They don't know
what path they should be taking.

153
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,950
They feel like maybe they've made some
mistakes in their journey and they want

154
00:09:55,951 --> 00:10:00,430
to reinvent themselves. And so I became
very interested on, because I had read it,

155
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,860
mentored myself so many times,

156
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:07,250
I became very interested in this process
of reinventing myself and getting rid

157
00:10:07,321 --> 00:10:12,000
of all the obstacles along the way. Like
if you, if anybody were to decide, oh,

158
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,280
I don't want to be a
software engineer anymore.

159
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,620
I don't want to be an accountant anymore.

160
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,660
I want to be a an actor, I want
to be a writer, I want to be,

161
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:25,860
um, I want to be a doctor or
work in the healthcare business.

162
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,960
Somehow people will always,

163
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:31,290
the first thing everyone will
tell you is you can't do that.

164
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,390
And because I saw it time after time,

165
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:38,010
I've probably reinvented my career
15 times. And that's conservative.

166
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,700
And every single time someone has said,

167
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:46,530
usually the first person I spoke to,
my mother has said,

168
00:10:46,531 --> 00:10:51,080
you can't do this. And, and, and,

169
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,190
and, and you have to figure out, well,

170
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,640
how am I going to do this both
psychologically and mentally?

171
00:10:56,641 --> 00:10:59,940
How am I going to learn to do this? How
am I going to be around the right people?

172
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:03,210
So that they influenced me?
And, and I'm inspired by them.

173
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:06,180
How do I stay healthy enough so I
have the energy to do the sticks,

174
00:11:06,181 --> 00:11:08,130
a lot of energy to reinvent a career.

175
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:13,520
How do I kind of spiritually
and void the anxiety of failure?

176
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,550
If you try to, if you say to
yourself, okay, I'm going to,

177
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,430
I'm not going to work in a cubicle.

178
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:24,690
I'm going to be a professional
skateboarder. Well, if
you do that initially,

179
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,940
you're going to fail every day.
You're going to fail at it. Um,

180
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,000
because you're going to
realize you're going to,

181
00:11:30,001 --> 00:11:33,000
you're going to love something enough
that you're going to realize, oh,

182
00:11:33,001 --> 00:11:35,010
the best people in the
world do it this way,

183
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,980
but I'm not that good yet because you're
going to understand the difference

184
00:11:37,981 --> 00:11:39,480
between the best and yourself.

185
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,370
So you have to get through the psychology
of how do I keep improving even though

186
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:49,000
it's so hard and so painful
to fail every single day. Uh,

187
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,770
and just all these things of the process
of reinvention, the pain of reinvention,

188
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,530
the pain of success is,
uh,

189
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,450
is very psychological and requires a lot
of energy and it requires a lot of, uh,

190
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:06,550
uh, spirituality is the wrong word, but
a way of dealing with the anxiety of,

191
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:11,140
of trying to improve yourself no
matter what age you are. You know,

192
00:12:11,141 --> 00:12:13,510
we always think, oh, when I'm 18,

193
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,320
that's when I'll put myself on the right
path because I'll study it in college

194
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,920
and then I'll be an expert and then all
succeed at what I say to in college.

195
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,560
But what if at the age of 40,
you decided you want to change?

196
00:12:23,561 --> 00:12:28,240
What if the age of 60, you decide you
want to change and people change at every,

197
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:28,931
you know,

198
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:33,070
I don't know anybody who's done the
same thing from the age of 20 to 60.

199
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,100
And you have to be able to deal
with all the ups and downs. Now,

200
00:12:36,101 --> 00:12:38,640
some people don't and they decided they,

201
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:43,870
they stay the same and they get gradually
that chronic level of anxiety that

202
00:12:44,771 --> 00:12:46,840
just builds into their system.

203
00:12:46,841 --> 00:12:50,350
And then every disease
basically is related to that.

204
00:12:50,351 --> 00:12:55,351
Like that slow stress that you don't
really notice but exists as opposed to

205
00:12:55,361 --> 00:12:57,430
handling the volatility of,

206
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:03,060
of trying to succeed at something that
volatility eventually subsides and you

207
00:13:03,761 --> 00:13:06,820
succeed. But it's very,
very difficult on that path.

208
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,600
And so I became very interested in,
that's why I started the podcast.

209
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,570
That's why I wrote these books. Choose
yourself, reinvent yourself and,

210
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,670
and with choose yourself was a
great example where I didn't want,

211
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,120
I wanted to write a book that was a story
that was for me and I didn't want to

212
00:13:25,451 --> 00:13:27,880
deal with and I,
and of course because I was,

213
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,020
the book was called choose yourself or
wanting to figure out how do I choose

214
00:13:32,021 --> 00:13:34,060
myself with publishing this book here.

215
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:37,660
If any of you have written a book
or tried to write a book before, uh,

216
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:42,310
it's very hard to get published. And,
and, and the rewards of it are very small.

217
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,820
So you have to get through,
when you submit your book to somebody,

218
00:13:45,821 --> 00:13:47,320
you have to get through an agent,

219
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,710
you have to get to through an editor's
assistant. An editor has to say,

220
00:13:50,711 --> 00:13:53,890
this is a great book of Marketing Team
for a publisher has to say this great

221
00:13:53,891 --> 00:13:57,490
book, this is a great book. The publisher
has to say, this is a great book.

222
00:13:57,491 --> 00:13:58,810
It public tries a committee,

223
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,750
they have to say it's a great book
bookstores that I have to say,

224
00:14:01,751 --> 00:14:05,110
it's a great book.
So all these steps along the way,

225
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:09,340
you have to have all these people who
are not qualified really to tell you your

226
00:14:09,341 --> 00:14:12,610
book is good or bad when you're the
only one who is qualified to decide.

227
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,950
So I decided to skip that with the book.
Choose yourself.

228
00:14:17,951 --> 00:14:19,960
And I've done that ever
since. And that, by the way,

229
00:14:19,961 --> 00:14:24,180
what's my most successful book has
sold over a million copies. And, uh,

230
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,440
uh, you know, again,

231
00:14:26,441 --> 00:14:29,800
the benefits of not only
doing what you love doing,

232
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:34,630
but figuring out along the way how to
avoid the obstacles that nobody else has

233
00:14:34,631 --> 00:14:38,740
even thought to avoid, uh, choose
yourself. I ended up self publishing,

234
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:42,730
I self published it through another
smaller company down the street called

235
00:14:42,731 --> 00:14:46,000
Amazon are actually up the
street very far I should say.

236
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,560
Uh, you know, and again,
with everything you do,

237
00:14:50,561 --> 00:14:54,500
there's ways to usually choose yourself
to kind of avoid a lot of the obstacles

238
00:14:54,501 --> 00:14:57,110
and pitfalls that the gatekeepers,

239
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:01,840
we'll always try to put in your way that
you can't do this people. Yeah. So, and a,

240
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,950
in a nutshell, that's,
that's my background.

241
00:15:03,951 --> 00:15:07,100
I could talk about specific hedge
fund strategies was that's not as as

242
00:15:07,101 --> 00:15:10,460
interesting or how to make a website or
whatever that that's not as interesting

243
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,000
how, and you will writing, uh, manuals
for computer chips at one point, right?

244
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:18,130
Yeah.
Long time ago in a I,

245
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:21,110
there was a company called
four systems that, uh,

246
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:26,170
had the fastest chips out there and I
was writing there their manuals and I

247
00:15:26,931 --> 00:15:31,610
remember, uh, and I wanted to be a writer
and so I thought they hired me figuring,

248
00:15:31,611 --> 00:15:35,930
hey, I knew computers, I knew hardware,
I'll play around with their chips,

249
00:15:35,931 --> 00:15:36,201
I'd write.

250
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:40,340
So I wrote the initial software for
their chips and then I wrote the customer

251
00:15:40,341 --> 00:15:44,870
manuals and they were,
they were so bad cause I was,

252
00:15:44,871 --> 00:15:46,790
you can't do something
you're not interested in.

253
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:50,060
And the CEO calls me in his office
and he literally said to me,

254
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,980
don't even take any pride in your work.

255
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:55,390
And like what kind of response
is that going to get? Like,

256
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:59,960
am I going to suddenly realize, oh, you're
right, I can take more pride in my work.

257
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,440
I just immediately, I think
thought to myself, I'm like,

258
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,290
I'm like nodding to him on his
suggestions, but I'm thinking to myself,

259
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:10,410
I have to quit this job as quickly as
possible. And that's what I did was,

260
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:14,030
was quit. I quit and left for
HBO. Uh, I know I left eye.

261
00:16:14,031 --> 00:16:15,980
There was an intermediate job in between,
but yeah.

262
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:19,420
How so how do you go from, from that,
from like working a dead end job,

263
00:16:19,421 --> 00:16:21,080
not being inspired?
Uh,

264
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,730
maybe having some kind of like learned
helplessness around like trying things on

265
00:16:24,731 --> 00:16:29,040
the outside, uh, to what you are now,
which is an idea machine where you,

266
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:32,360
you're trying things constantly. If
you think of something you'd do it, uh,

267
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,900
you're involved, you have your hand and
you know, millions of different things.

268
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,460
You're incredibly productive.

269
00:16:36,461 --> 00:16:40,180
How do you go from that to
where you are now and, and,

270
00:16:40,181 --> 00:16:45,181
and maybe focus on the incremental kind
of small steps you took in that dead end

271
00:16:45,551 --> 00:16:47,200
job?
It's to get where you are now.

272
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:50,290
I mean there's, there's a lot of
different answers. I'll, I'll,

273
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:55,300
I'll kind of skip ahead 20 years
to answer it. At one point,

274
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,990
uh, not quite 20 years,
maybe 18, 17 years later,

275
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:03,430
but at one point I was broke again
probably for the third time I,

276
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:07,690
I kept making a lot of money and then
somehow faring out the fastest way

277
00:17:07,691 --> 00:17:08,441
possible.
It was like,

278
00:17:08,441 --> 00:17:11,080
it was like my life's goal to figure
out the fastest way possible to lose

279
00:17:11,081 --> 00:17:16,000
millions of dollars each time. And so
one time again, I was broke and I was,

280
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:17,950
I remember I was on a Hammock,

281
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:23,320
I had two houses and there's nice piece
of property and there was a hammock in

282
00:17:23,321 --> 00:17:27,070
between them and it was just pouring
rain. And I was, and I realized, you know,

283
00:17:27,071 --> 00:17:29,440
I'm broke again.
It's pouring rain.

284
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:34,610
I there was the IRS that literally
like stamped on the wall of the house,

285
00:17:35,381 --> 00:17:38,590
like, you know, going to
be seized any day now.

286
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:41,920
And I'm on this hand and I'm thinking,
how could this happen to me again?

287
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:46,660
Why is it happening to me again
and again and again? And uh,

288
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,970
I,
I realize well,

289
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,770
the way up things were happening
differently than on the way down.

290
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:55,260
And it was what I talked about earlier.
I had focused on,

291
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:59,850
on the way up every time I had focused
really hard on physical health.

292
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:03,930
It's basically, it doesn't mean go to
the gym every day, but it means eat well,

293
00:18:03,931 --> 00:18:06,720
move well, sleep well, emotional health,

294
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,600
which means be around good
people who will support you.

295
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:13,170
One toxic person will.
You need to 20.

296
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:18,350
You need 20 or 30 positive people in your
life to counteract one toxic person in

297
00:18:18,511 --> 00:18:22,230
your life. And it's such an important
rule. That ratio never changes.

298
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,460
Creative health,
which is do one creative thing a day.

299
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,780
And spiritual health as I referred to
it before, but the creative health,

300
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,510
now I'm going to go back in
time a few years. Um, so it,

301
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:39,510
prior time I had been broke,
uh, I decided, okay, I want to,

302
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,560
I had never been in the hedge
fund or finance space before I,

303
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:45,690
I had been in the Internet space.
I was a technologist.

304
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:48,750
I had been in the creative space,
I had shot TV shows,

305
00:18:48,751 --> 00:18:51,420
I had done a bunch of things,
I had written books. Um,

306
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,700
but I want it to be in the finance space.

307
00:18:53,701 --> 00:18:56,790
So that's when I wrote this
software modeling the stock markets.

308
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,500
And I wrote to everybody in the business
that was a hero of mine and I said,

309
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:05,790
can you meet me for a cup of coffee?
I'll just take five minutes of your time.

310
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:09,700
Can you meet for a cup of
coffee? Uh, I got zero response,

311
00:19:09,701 --> 00:19:10,830
zero to 50 people.

312
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:15,950
I got zero responses because it's not
as if Warren buffet is going to suddenly

313
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:21,000
get my email and say,
Gladys,

314
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,220
hold all meetings.

315
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:29,210
James Out of the chair is going to buy
me a 60 cent cup of coffee downstairs and

316
00:19:29,731 --> 00:19:34,260
I really need to meet this guy and let
him pick my brain for five minutes.

317
00:19:34,261 --> 00:19:38,550
There's probably be more like an hour
or two. Um, nobody ever says that.

318
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:42,900
I don't know why I say Gladys was his
secretary. It seemed like the sort of,

319
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,640
if you thought were
above it and a secretary,

320
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:48,960
it's like Gladys or Bertha or something
like that. Like, I dunno why I think that.

321
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,070
I don't know why. I think she's a woman.
I happen to know she's a woman now,

322
00:19:53,071 --> 00:19:56,670
but could have been a man.
He has a secretary, but um,

323
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,360
nobody responded. And so
I figured, you know what,

324
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:04,170
I need to get figured out every
time something goes wrong.

325
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,900
It's not the common
denominator in all these years.

326
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,620
It's not like Warren Buffet or,
or all these people were bad guys.

327
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,610
I'm the common denominator in
50 people not responding to me.

328
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,060
So what did I do wrong? And you
have to think about it. And so,

329
00:20:18,061 --> 00:20:20,790
well I was being totally selfish.
His warrant,

330
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:25,020
all these Bill Gates time is
more valuable than my time. He's,

331
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,880
he's a better human being than me.

332
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:29,520
So why should he give me
five minutes of his time?

333
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:32,270
And so I needed to,

334
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:35,550
to start exercising what
I call the idea muscle.

335
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,880
Now if you have a bicycle accident and
you're in the hospital bed for two weeks,

336
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:44,310
you need physical therapy to walk again,

337
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:49,390
your leg muscles will atrophy that. So
it's the same thing with the idea muscle.

338
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,830
If you don't come up with ideas
every single day and even bad ideas,

339
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,560
you'll lose the ability to
come up with good ideas.

340
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:00,220
And so I started writing down
10 ideas a day just for myself.

341
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,790
They can be ideas about businesses that
can be ideas of books I want to write.

342
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,940
It could be just stupid ideas like,
oh,

343
00:21:06,941 --> 00:21:11,630
here's 10 pieces of clothing
I'm going to design. Like just,

344
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:15,880
I don't know how to design clothes. Here's
10 pieces of clothing. So every day I,

345
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,970
to this day,
I still come up with 10 ideas a day.

346
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,180
And today for instance,
I'm,

347
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,710
I'm an advisor on a a TV show.
I came up with 10 ideas for them.

348
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:29,860
And uh, uh, uh,

349
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:34,300
yesterday I had an idea 10 things.
And this is not even ideas for business.

350
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,910
10 things I value more than money.

351
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:41,380
And I remember on the very first list
of ideas I wrote, this was in 2002,

352
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,920
I wrote,
um,

353
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:48,500
10 games I could teach people,
uh,

354
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,440
to be great at, in, in, in, in
just three or four easy tips.

355
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:55,420
So the idea is I wanted to write a book,

356
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:59,560
how to beat your friends and family
at every game in the universe.

357
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:03,520
Because when you go to thanksgiving,
you play your friend right after dinner,

358
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,500
you break out the monopoly board,

359
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:10,180
a or scrabble and you want to beat all
your friends and family and humiliate

360
00:22:10,181 --> 00:22:12,940
them completely and why not?
If you're going to beat them,

361
00:22:12,941 --> 00:22:16,060
you might as well humiliate them.
And uh,

362
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,480
and so I wrote down 10 ideas of games
and then for each game that three or four

363
00:22:21,701 --> 00:22:23,560
ideas of how to win in that game.

364
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,830
And then now suddenly I had an idea
for a book that I could easily write,

365
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:31,630
which I never did. Most ideas are bad,
but like take a game like monopoly.

366
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,000
What's the one thing you need to do to,

367
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:36,580
to beat all your friends
and family and monopoly.

368
00:22:36,581 --> 00:22:41,060
It's just one tip and you'll beat
everyone at monopoly. Anybody know,

369
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:46,000
build hotels is not correct.

370
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,220
Persuade them. Okay. If
you're a good negotiator,

371
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,460
but there's one set of properties,
I'll give you a head.

372
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:58,330
There's one set of properties that are
far more valuable than any other set of

373
00:22:58,331 --> 00:23:00,670
properties by a factor of like five.

374
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:04,840
So parking and Broadway,
you're saying park place and Broadway.

375
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,020
That is the most valuable pieces,
but a squares.

376
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:11,750
But it's not the most important to own.
In fact, those are the worst. All of them.

377
00:23:11,751 --> 00:23:16,630
Sorry to say. Um, no. I'll
tell you now. Nobody got it.

378
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:19,420
The orange properties say in New York,

379
00:23:19,421 --> 00:23:22,990
I have Saint James Place in
Tennessee and I'll tell you why.

380
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:27,160
The most popular square to
land on in monopoly is jail.

381
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:30,310
Cause there's three ways land on
jail either let him to go to jail,

382
00:23:30,311 --> 00:23:34,000
square the dice, take you to jail
or the community chest is a car,

383
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,600
go to jail immediately.
So there's three ways to let on jealous.

384
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,900
The most popular square on the board,

385
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,930
the most popular roll
with the dice is a seven.

386
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:44,710
Seven takes you to the utility right
in the middle of the RN squares.

387
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:48,290
So you're most likely to land
on the R and the squares.

388
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,270
So someone else should own.

389
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,500
You should own the orange squares and
then build hotels on just the RN squares.

390
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:57,170
And then you'll win. Bam. That's monopoly.

391
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,930
After the talk I can answer
about any other game monopolies.

392
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,510
The easiest to understand.
So,

393
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:08,450
so then I started writing 10
ideas for these other people.

394
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:12,980
So I wrote 20 emails or I really
researched each person. I said,

395
00:24:12,981 --> 00:24:16,160
here's 10 ideas for your business.
10 I didn't ask for a cup of coffee.

396
00:24:16,161 --> 00:24:19,460
I didn't ask for anything with
one guy wrote, here's 10 ideas.

397
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:24,380
He was a well known writers, still is
a 10 ideas articles about investing.

398
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,920
You should write with another person.
Big Hedge fund manager. I said,

399
00:24:27,921 --> 00:24:31,970
here's 10 pieces of software
that you could use. I,

400
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,080
we have very similar
stylistic way of investing.

401
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:39,840
Here's 10 pieces of
software for you for all.

402
00:24:39,841 --> 00:24:42,710
Even teach your employees how
to use the software they work.

403
00:24:42,711 --> 00:24:45,680
Here's the my personal track record
with them. You could have them.

404
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,560
And another person, I
wrote 10 ideas for him. Uh,

405
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:54,740
and out of those 23 people responded,
you still get a very low response rate,

406
00:24:54,741 --> 00:24:55,120
but you're,

407
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,540
but you're giving now instead of trying
to take ideas are all about giving.

408
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,730
He always want to help people with
each idea. So the, the writer said,

409
00:25:04,731 --> 00:25:07,520
these are great ideas.
Why don't you write them for us?

410
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:10,280
So I started writing for his website.
It was Jim Cramer.

411
00:25:10,281 --> 00:25:14,170
We started writing for the, for his
website, the street.com and I beat,

412
00:25:14,171 --> 00:25:17,270
and then I got a book deal based on
what I was writing because it was very

413
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:20,120
different type of stuff and
that, and I wrote, you know,

414
00:25:20,121 --> 00:25:24,620
seven or eight books about investing
after that and I've been on CNBC a billion

415
00:25:24,621 --> 00:25:27,110
times. Jim Cramer was about
to call him my podcast again,

416
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,570
so you build a relationship
over over decades.

417
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:33,440
Another person who responded
was this big hedge fund manager.

418
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:36,170
He invited me over for lunch,

419
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:40,490
we got to know each other and he ended
up personally investing money with me and

420
00:25:40,491 --> 00:25:44,690
then I started my hedge fund and then
the third person who responded and said,

421
00:25:44,691 --> 00:25:48,050
yeah, sure I'll have, let's have
lunch and talk about these ideas.

422
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,790
I never responded to him.

423
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:55,130
12 years later I hit reply on
that exact same email and I said,

424
00:25:55,131 --> 00:25:57,950
hey, can you come on my
podcast instead of lunch?

425
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:03,190
This is 2014 I hit reply on that
email instead of 20 instead of 2002 he

426
00:26:03,351 --> 00:26:04,820
responded and said,
sure.

427
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,700
It's the only pockets he's ever been
on the seem to lab who wrote fooled by

428
00:26:07,701 --> 00:26:10,970
randomness,
Black Swan antifragile uh,

429
00:26:10,971 --> 00:26:14,210
and now he's coming Wednesday called
on my podcasts again in February. So,

430
00:26:14,211 --> 00:26:17,960
so he's never been ever been
on any other podcasts. So it's,

431
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:20,960
that's another thing I typically do is
I'll go through my emails from 10 years

432
00:26:20,961 --> 00:26:24,530
ago and I have 280,000 unread emails.

433
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:29,740
So I'll hit reply on on an email from
2007 and just answer as if I got the email

434
00:26:30,321 --> 00:26:35,321
yesterday and no one has ever not
responded to that way of getting back in

435
00:26:38,001 --> 00:26:40,640
touch. You know how sometimes you
don't get back in touch with someone,

436
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:41,750
you feel really bad about it.

437
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:47,070
Wait 10 and then reply
life hack number eight, 67.

438
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,960
So, uh, so this, this idea,

439
00:26:49,961 --> 00:26:54,150
so I haven't stopped doing it since
2002 every single day I'll write down 10

440
00:26:54,151 --> 00:26:58,820
ideas up, but then sometimes people say,
sorry if I'm answering very long. No,

441
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:01,680
it's great, but, but you asked
about the micro steps you take.

442
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:06,090
Sometimes people say, Oh, I
did. Ideas are a dime a dozen.

443
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:10,440
Execution is everything. People
don't realize execution is a subset.

444
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:13,620
Execution ideas are a
subset of actual ideas.

445
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:17,910
So I'll give an example that involves
Google and and particularly android.

446
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,120
I was that uh,
uh,

447
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:24,240
a birthday dinner and our friend of mine
was there with his brand new girlfriend

448
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:29,040
and I said, oh, you guys look
really cute together. And they said,

449
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,850
oh, we just had the conversation,
we're going steady now. And I'm like,

450
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:37,640
do people still say that going steady?
Like if that upgrade and,

451
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:40,590
and he said, yeah, we even
deleted are dating apps.

452
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:43,560
So I had an idea of the next day on my,

453
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:48,770
I did an a a 10 app ideas and one of the
ideas was let's make a going steady app

454
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:54,660
and are going steady app. Would you agree
that you download the going steady app?

455
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:56,430
You Bro,
you linked to each other.

456
00:27:56,430 --> 00:28:01,430
You both say we're going steady and it
deletes all the dating apps on both bones

457
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:04,230
and it keeps track of all
the dating apps out there.

458
00:28:04,231 --> 00:28:05,400
Just in case there are new ones.

459
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:10,670
And if the other side ever let downloads
a dating app or does anything tricky,

460
00:28:11,641 --> 00:28:16,620
we figured it all out. The other person
gets informed. And so I wrote down,

461
00:28:16,621 --> 00:28:17,610
what's the 10 execute?

462
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:22,700
So then the next day I wrote here
is the 10 mini execution steps.

463
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:25,810
It's not like, oh, uh,

464
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,130
how will I raise VC funding for this APP?

465
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,620
That's the stupidest thing of all.
You don't,

466
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,950
you don't think of a ways to help
people and then immediately say,

467
00:28:34,951 --> 00:28:38,660
give me money to help people.
You need to show that you're a qualified,

468
00:28:38,661 --> 00:28:41,640
a good person to, to help
people. So I thought,

469
00:28:41,641 --> 00:28:46,200
what are the 10 next steps in execution
that I can do to create this app?

470
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:51,530
So I went on freelance.com and
I specked out the whole app.

471
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,780
So first I specked out the
whole app actually. I said,

472
00:28:54,781 --> 00:28:58,560
this is what the front screen looks like.
This is what the sub screens look like.

473
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,590
Here's how you log on, here's how
to people connect to each other.

474
00:29:01,591 --> 00:29:03,150
Here's how to people message each other.

475
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:07,830
Here's the list of Apps I want to watch
out for. And then I expect it out.

476
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:12,720
And on freelance.com I
got 10 companies from us,

477
00:29:12,721 --> 00:29:16,750
India and Malaysia, the big
three as we call them. And uh,

478
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:22,200
that was a joke. But, uh, uh,
uh, add, everybody said, oh,

479
00:29:22,201 --> 00:29:26,190
we'll do it for $1,000 or $2,000 or $500.

480
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:29,610
And then I called up each one and I said,

481
00:29:29,611 --> 00:29:32,160
the one question I have that I don't
know and I can't figure it out with my

482
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:32,910
research,

483
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:37,910
the one question I have wa is can android
and Ios from within an APP find the

484
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,840
other ad? Ooh. See what
other apps are on the phone?

485
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:49,150
It turns out android,
yes. Ios. No. And since,

486
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:53,230
uh, many, you know, I didn't want to
just do it for one operating system.

487
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:58,380
I didn't do that idea even though I'm
absolutely sure it would have been a huge

488
00:29:59,051 --> 00:30:01,060
hit.
But uh,

489
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:05,800
but here's a case where I had the idea
I had the execution ideas I executed on.

490
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,320
They were all,
it took me three hours,

491
00:30:08,321 --> 00:30:13,260
two hours from beginning to end to
figure out t to Spec out the site, the,

492
00:30:13,261 --> 00:30:18,160
the APP. Talk to at advertise it to
actually find developers, call them,

493
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,840
figure out what my main question was,

494
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:23,410
ask them and determine it was not
a good idea, a good enough idea.

495
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,690
So execution is not as
hard as people think,

496
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:29,710
but you still have to be good at idea
generation to be good at execution idea

497
00:30:29,711 --> 00:30:33,790
generation. So you know what those
micro execution steps are. Now,

498
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:37,990
if anyone could help me figure out how
to do from within IOS APP to see the

499
00:30:37,991 --> 00:30:40,400
other Ios apps we're in business.

500
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,270
But that's kind of an example of, you
know, ideas can lead to execution.

501
00:30:46,271 --> 00:30:49,810
They're not separate. It's not that
execution is everything, ideas or nothing.

502
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,750
They're there, they're
interwoven and connected. Yes.

503
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,090
That was my huge response
to that question.

504
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:57,210
Great answer. Thank you. Um,

505
00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:01,260
so you've had these kind of wild financial
swings that you just describing your

506
00:31:01,261 --> 00:31:05,790
life, um, and it, it's, uh, been
kind of a volatile path for you.

507
00:31:05,791 --> 00:31:10,710
How is that changed your philosophy
and how have things like minimalism and

508
00:31:10,711 --> 00:31:14,760
stoicism and kind of non attachment
to material things and money kind of

509
00:31:14,761 --> 00:31:16,020
informed the way you think now?

510
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:21,250
Yeah. So, so, uh, I
mean it's really, I see,

511
00:31:21,251 --> 00:31:26,251
I see what I call failure porn
all over the Internet now.

512
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:30,880
Like, oh, I failed. So my next thing
will be a success. Oh, I failed.

513
00:31:30,881 --> 00:31:32,110
Here's 10 things I learned.

514
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:37,850
X Sorta as tells me that they didn't
quite fail because failure is really

515
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:43,150
insanely painful and difficult. You know,
some failures more than others, but,

516
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:47,230
um, and it's really unpleasant. It's
an unpleasant feeling in your stomach.

517
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,230
You feel like, you know, just
because you hit rock bottom,

518
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:54,940
it doesn't mean you're not going to go
even lower. Most people I know who say,

519
00:31:54,941 --> 00:31:58,480
well, I hit bottom here and
then if I drill, like on my
podcast, people will say,

520
00:31:58,481 --> 00:32:01,600
I hit rock bottom here. And I'm
like, really? Well, what happened?

521
00:32:01,601 --> 00:32:03,970
Where were you six months
later? And they were like, well,

522
00:32:03,971 --> 00:32:07,630
then I was in the street with a
needle out of my elbow. Oh, okay.

523
00:32:07,631 --> 00:32:12,600
That sounds like more like rock
bottom to me. Um, and uh, uh,

524
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,260
so it's really,
it's really painful,

525
00:32:14,261 --> 00:32:19,240
but I think that's what really
focused me on at the end of the day.

526
00:32:19,241 --> 00:32:23,350
I really, I really, and I say
this to my daughters to a,

527
00:32:23,351 --> 00:32:28,030
I ask them to ask themselves,
who have I helped today?

528
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:31,620
Because if you've helped,
that means you have some energy that,

529
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:35,490
and that means you have ideas and so on.
But really I,

530
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:40,310
I make sure I check the list every
day. Physical health, emotional health,

531
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:45,650
creative or idea health and spiritual
health and the spiritual health. Again,

532
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:49,700
can I deal with the inevitable things
that I can't control? Like, oh,

533
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:54,740
this business failed. You know, it's
over. I mean, there was one day,

534
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,370
can I tell a story again? We
have time. Yeah, go for it.

535
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:00,440
So there's one day I was
on the set of a TV show,

536
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:04,400
some friends of mine who
created this TV show and uh,

537
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,820
they invited me to watch
the pilot being filmed.

538
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,550
And like one of my favorite
directors was filming the pilot.

539
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,740
Some of my favorite
actors were in the show,

540
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:17,240
having the best day I was on the board
of a company and my shares in this

541
00:33:17,241 --> 00:33:19,160
company,
we were worth millions of dollars.

542
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,410
And I get this message
in the middle of the day,

543
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:24,950
emergency board meeting and I'm thinking,
great,

544
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,810
the company got sold,

545
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,830
I'm going to finally cash in
on the shares and I'm going to,

546
00:33:30,831 --> 00:33:33,380
it's going to be great.
And um,

547
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:38,750
I get on the board and I mean, I got on
the call and it was announced right away.

548
00:33:38,751 --> 00:33:40,760
Well,
our largest shareholder,

549
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,330
he just told us he owes
$90 million to the IRS.

550
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,620
He never disclosed that before.
Uh, we had to tell our bank,

551
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:53,570
our bank has fired us as the management
team except for this one board meeting.

552
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:57,770
They're going to pick apart the company
and just sell it in pieces to their

553
00:33:57,771 --> 00:34:02,060
other customers. Uh, it was a billion
revenue company and we're going to sell,

554
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:04,230
they're going to sell off each region,
um,

555
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,950
and dissolve the company just so
that they can make their money back.

556
00:34:06,951 --> 00:34:08,540
We owed them like 15 million,

557
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:12,590
which was nothing really for a billion
revenue company, but it was, you know, we,

558
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,900
this was the rule and a,

559
00:34:14,901 --> 00:34:19,400
within days my shares went from being
worth millions to be worth zero.

560
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:23,060
And I try it on the board,
like on the call,

561
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:27,770
how about I buy the pieces or have I
find buyers for each piece of the company

562
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:32,000
or have it, I've raised money and we just
pay back the bank. And they were like,

563
00:34:32,001 --> 00:34:34,430
everything I said,
it was just too late.

564
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,140
They've already locked us out
of the offices. It's over. And,

565
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:43,590
and now I get off the phone and now my
favorite actor is filming this amazing

566
00:34:44,691 --> 00:34:45,290
scene.

567
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:48,290
If I even told you the scene and you've
seen the show and you've seen the scene,

568
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,550
and, and, and my, my favorite director,

569
00:34:52,551 --> 00:34:55,050
he's directed like
limitless. He directed, um,

570
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:59,750
all these great movies and uh,
and I just figured, you know what,

571
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:03,950
I'm in the middle of nowhere. Uh,
I just lost millions of dollars,

572
00:35:03,951 --> 00:35:07,700
but I'm on this as the person. I'm gonna
ever on the set of a TV show like this.

573
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,590
I'm just going to enjoy
the rest of the day.

574
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:13,310
And so I spent the next eight hours
asking questions to the directors,

575
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:17,940
the writers, the actors. Uh, and a
few months later I explained to the,

576
00:35:17,941 --> 00:35:21,200
one of the writers what had happened
that day and they were like, oh my gosh,

577
00:35:21,201 --> 00:35:23,750
you were the last one
to leave. You were, uh,

578
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:28,340
asking questions all day long and
enjoying it. And, uh, you know,

579
00:35:28,341 --> 00:35:31,730
I think it's really important and like I
couldn't control anymore that situation

580
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,360
and I knew I wasn't going to sleep at
night cause I was going to be depressed

581
00:35:35,361 --> 00:35:37,040
and anxious, but I figured, okay,

582
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:40,800
right now I'm here and I'm never
going to get this chance again.

583
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:45,830
We only live one life and I'm gonna
learn a lot and I'm going to take what I

584
00:35:45,901 --> 00:35:48,570
learned into,
into new things and new opportunities.

585
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:53,130
And I decided to focus on that and not
think about this negative thing until I,

586
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,200
I made an appointment to think about it
later with myself when I got home. And,

587
00:35:57,310 --> 00:36:00,180
and that's how I acted in the
day. And I think, you know,

588
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:05,160
not wallowing and things you can't
control is a very important part of um,

589
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,040
you know, moving forward
and making progress in life.

590
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:09,960
Otherwise it will just be
always held back by these,

591
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,460
these negative events you can't control.
Yeah.

592
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:15,760
And how do you use failure
to hack the 10,000 hour rule?

593
00:36:15,761 --> 00:36:17,380
So for those of you that don't know,

594
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:22,650
Malcolm Gladwell wrote a book called
outliers about 10,000 hours required to,

595
00:36:22,871 --> 00:36:24,010
or this is just part of the book,

596
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:28,000
10,000 hours required to be
really great at any skill. Um,

597
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:30,940
and it does make you a
little kind of defeatist.

598
00:36:30,941 --> 00:36:34,120
It makes you think you don't have to
be Mozart or Andre Agassi to get really

599
00:36:34,121 --> 00:36:38,750
good at a certain scale. So how do you
use failure to kind of short circuit that?

600
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,730
Yeah, so that's, that's a great question.

601
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:44,600
So anytime you want to get good at
something, I don't know how old, uh,

602
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:48,170
many of you are.
Bomb 49 I'm going to be 50 in a month.

603
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:51,140
And just as an example,

604
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:56,410
over the past year I've gotten somewhat
obsessed with doing standup comedy.

605
00:36:56,870 --> 00:37:01,340
So I, I do stand up comedy
at different clubs, uh,

606
00:37:01,341 --> 00:37:04,340
all around New York.
I'm doing Chicago next week.

607
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:08,120
I go up three to six times a week.
And um,

608
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:09,680
and it's a scary thing.

609
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,890
It's the scariest thing and it's the
hardest skill I've ever had to learn.

610
00:37:12,891 --> 00:37:16,580
And I've learned many different
skills in my life, uh,

611
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,220
that are considered hard skills.
And,

612
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:23,060
and I talked to a lot of comedians
and they're all like, yeah, 20 years,

613
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,660
15 to 20 years is if you
watched a special on Netflix,

614
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:30,560
chances are that comedian you're watching
has been doing it for at least 15,

615
00:37:30,561 --> 00:37:34,680
probably more like 20 or 25 years.
And I'm thinking to myself, uh,

616
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:39,400
oh my gosh, I want to do this in a
year. I don't want to do it in WWE.

617
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:42,110
I don't want to be doing
this when I'm 70 years old.

618
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:46,460
And it's so painful because you're,
yeah,

619
00:37:46,461 --> 00:37:48,970
you're making people laugh,
but before you go on,

620
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:52,910
you're really nervous and sometimes you
bomb and sometimes you get heckled and

621
00:37:52,911 --> 00:37:57,170
sometimes you feel really awful afterwards
and there's so many sub skills you

622
00:37:57,171 --> 00:37:59,930
need to learn.
It's not just about telling a good joke,

623
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,160
there's maybe 50 different sub skills.
And by way of comparison,

624
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,280
I'd say becoming a chess master,

625
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:11,810
maybe there's 20 different mutually
exclusive sub skills you have to learn and

626
00:38:11,811 --> 00:38:15,020
master to become an overall
chess master with comedy.

627
00:38:15,021 --> 00:38:19,610
I would say there's about
50 subscales. And so, um,

628
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:22,790
part of this is related to
here. I said to myself, well,

629
00:38:22,791 --> 00:38:24,500
I've been doing all these pie.

630
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,980
I've done 300 podcasts with
amazing peak peak performers,

631
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:31,250
the best performers in the world
at what they do. Again, I'll again,

632
00:38:31,251 --> 00:38:36,010
I'll mention Tony Hawk at skateboarding
or Garry Kasparov at chess or,

633
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:40,450
uh, astro teller from Google
has been on my podcast. Um,

634
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,300
Sara Blakely is probably the only self,

635
00:38:43,301 --> 00:38:47,440
made a female billionaire on the
Forbes list who mentored spanx.

636
00:38:47,441 --> 00:38:52,150
She's been on my podcast area and a
Huffington, uh, so many great writers,

637
00:38:52,151 --> 00:38:55,360
actors, Comedians,
athletes, entrepreneurs,

638
00:38:55,361 --> 00:39:00,190
Richard Branson was just on and so,
but on the 10,000 hour rule specifically,

639
00:39:00,191 --> 00:39:04,540
I also had on Anders Ericsson who
Malcolm Gladwell in his book outliers,

640
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:08,410
he's quoting Anders Ericsson and the
10,000 hour rule. So I wanted to know.

641
00:39:08,411 --> 00:39:12,100
So I invited Anders Ericsson on
Anders Eriksson broke it down.

642
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:14,170
It's not quite 10,000 hours.

643
00:39:14,171 --> 00:39:18,450
That was just a catchy phrase that
was used in the book for some people,

644
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:21,730
10,000 hours. For others it
wasn't. Um, he said the Beatles,

645
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:24,970
which was the example in
the book, the Beatles, uh,

646
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:29,920
performed 24 hours a day.
I had these German porn clubs before.

647
00:39:29,921 --> 00:39:32,770
They were famous just, and that was
how they got their 10,000 hours.

648
00:39:32,771 --> 00:39:33,670
Was the example.

649
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:37,930
Glad will use a now Anders
Ericsson thought it was more
like 4,000 hours when he

650
00:39:37,931 --> 00:39:40,120
calculated it out. So I figured, okay,

651
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:43,690
it might not be 10,000 hours for everybody
if you have some talent and so on,

652
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:48,280
although Erikson doesn't
believe in, in talent. And uh,

653
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:49,563
uh,

654
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:54,220
then I started asking everybody
what were common denominators in,

655
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:56,800
um,
your 10,000 hours in your,

656
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,310
in your move towards world excellence.

657
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:05,730
And there's a couple of ways that you
can kind of hack the 10,000 hours and an

658
00:40:07,331 --> 00:40:08,920
important one,
I'll get to failure in a second,

659
00:40:08,921 --> 00:40:13,921
but an important one is building up
a strong community of friends who are

660
00:40:15,401 --> 00:40:18,950
already successful in that subculture.
So anything you want to get good at,

661
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:22,060
let's do you want to get good at tennis.
There's already a subculture.

662
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:26,500
Like if you just show up at the
professional tennis courts or whatever,

663
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,750
nobody's going to talk to you
because they don't know who you are.

664
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:30,520
And they're already friends
with all the other pros.

665
00:40:30,521 --> 00:40:32,260
They don't want to talk
with the weaker players.

666
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:36,820
But if you can somehow figure out how
to be friends with all the strong people

667
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:40,810
in the space that you want
to get good at, um, that's,

668
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:45,990
you can literally skip five to eight
years of work because they know everything

669
00:40:47,861 --> 00:40:48,551
you're doing wrong.

670
00:40:48,551 --> 00:40:52,090
And they could just look at what you're
doing and they say this, this, this, this,

671
00:40:52,091 --> 00:40:56,320
you're doing wrong. So as an example, I
had a pink, like many people probably,

672
00:40:56,321 --> 00:40:58,780
I had a ping pong table in
my basement when I was a kid.

673
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,790
I played ping pong every day when I,

674
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:04,960
the whole time I was growing up and
I've played ping pong for 40 years.

675
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:09,850
Then I took ping pong lessons a few
months ago from a Worldclass Ping Pong

676
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,280
player.
Like he's world champion level.

677
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:17,950
100% of the things I was doing were wrong.
So the way I held a racket,

678
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:21,040
the way I swung, the
way I did, the backend,

679
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:25,960
the racket itself, uh, the way I stood,

680
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:30,790
even the way I kept score was wrong.
I didn't even know,

681
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:36,350
I didn't even know, I didn't even
know the rules of pink. So, so,

682
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:40,460
so just by taking a few lessons,
I immediately was like much,

683
00:41:40,461 --> 00:41:43,580
much better than I was
for 40 entire years.

684
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:48,740
And so that's the importance of
being around. You're the, you,

685
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:51,710
there's, let's say you're the average
of the five people around you. Well,

686
00:41:51,711 --> 00:41:54,950
if everybody around you
is a chess grandmaster,

687
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:58,370
you're going to much more easily be a
chess grandmaster as opposed to just

688
00:41:58,371 --> 00:42:03,230
playing bad people all day. And you
know that's true for everything in life.

689
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:07,370
So that's,
that's one fast way to hack a good,

690
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:10,460
let's say it really is 10,000 hours,
although I think it's less.

691
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,990
That's a way to hack like at least four
or 5,000 hours out of that 10,000 hours.

692
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:20,390
Now failure is extremely important.
So let's say comedy,

693
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:25,810
I go up on stage and one time I go
up and I used the same exact joke and

694
00:42:26,451 --> 00:42:31,451
everybody laughs the second time I
bought up on stage and nobody laughs.

695
00:42:31,491 --> 00:42:31,821
In fact,

696
00:42:31,821 --> 00:42:36,821
I might even get heckled and I have videos
of both I video tape all the times I

697
00:42:37,191 --> 00:42:41,120
go up on stage where most of the
times I go up on stage. So I'll,

698
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:46,340
I'll take the videos and I'll show
it to several comedians and I'll say,

699
00:42:46,341 --> 00:42:50,750
what is the difference between these
two videos? I don't understand.

700
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:53,780
I'm not seeing something.
But they've been doing it 20 years.

701
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:57,950
So they instantly see many,
many things that I don't see.

702
00:42:57,951 --> 00:42:59,780
I'm completely blind.
For me,

703
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:04,550
I'm only asking is the joke funny
or not for them, they're asking,

704
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:07,610
how are you holding the microphone?
How are you moving around the stage?

705
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:11,210
What does your voice sound like? Are
there more men than women in the audience?

706
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:13,610
Are there more older people than
younger people in the audience?

707
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:16,370
Are there more tourists or
non tourists in the audience?

708
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:19,610
Do you have a friend in the audience who
happens to be the first one laughing?

709
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:20,743
Um,

710
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:25,970
there's so many things they're
looking at that uh, they might say,

711
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:28,790
you may seem,
you may think you said the same joke,

712
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:31,220
but it's actually a different
joke in these various ways.

713
00:43:31,221 --> 00:43:36,140
You switch these two words or you took
two sips of water instead of one sip of

714
00:43:36,141 --> 00:43:37,250
water in the middle of that joke.

715
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:41,000
That was one response that was completely
a hundred percent the difference.

716
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:46,030
The reason why the same joke was funny
one time and not funding the other is

717
00:43:46,221 --> 00:43:49,100
that in the middle of the joke I took
two sips of water instead of one sip of

718
00:43:49,101 --> 00:43:49,730
water.

719
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:54,730
And there was a reason why the timing
created too much tension on the two sips

720
00:43:55,191 --> 00:43:56,570
of water versus the ones who are,

721
00:43:56,690 --> 00:44:01,640
but it took a professional
comedian to tell me that now. So,

722
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:06,020
so again,
failure allows you to ask,

723
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:09,200
you know, you can say, oh, I
failed the best, I'm going to quit.

724
00:44:09,201 --> 00:44:11,600
And that's what most people do.
Anything that's hard,

725
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:14,420
anything that's worth doing is hard else.

726
00:44:14,421 --> 00:44:18,590
Everybody would be a success
in everything. So everything
worth doing is very,

727
00:44:18,591 --> 00:44:20,000
very difficult.

728
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:24,320
So you're going to fail in big ways
and you're going to fail in little ways

729
00:44:24,321 --> 00:44:28,950
every single day. Every single time I go
onstage, I fail at something. And, um,

730
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,070
and I'm just speaking specifically about
comedy. I can be talking about chess.

731
00:44:32,071 --> 00:44:36,150
I could be talking about business and
business. There are so many sub skills,

732
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:39,660
again are probably say there's about 30
different sub skills that you have to

733
00:44:39,661 --> 00:44:44,220
master with each one to be, to make
money for yourself. Um, but I'll,

734
00:44:44,221 --> 00:44:48,630
I'll just stick to the common
example for a second. Um, uh,

735
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:51,630
you know, I had one case where, oh,

736
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:56,580
but this is why it's important to be
the question is how do you get to get

737
00:44:56,790 --> 00:45:01,290
professional comedians? Uh,
look at my little stupid videos.

738
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:02,610
They don't want me to be better.

739
00:45:02,611 --> 00:45:07,020
They don't want an extra person
saying he's a he or she is a comedian.

740
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:11,130
But I,
because of my business expertise,

741
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:16,370
I bought part of the comedy club
and that I performed at the most.

742
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:18,660
So now I get to talk to,

743
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:22,110
and I have a podcast
so I could talk to any,

744
00:45:22,111 --> 00:45:26,160
almost any comedian I want to talk to.
And right in the middle of my podcast, oh,

745
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:28,850
this is part of the bog guys. Look at
these two videos of me doing comedy.

746
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:33,390
Tell me where I went wrong.
And it's a great way to get feedback.

747
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:38,660
And so I've figured out how
to hack getting professionals
to look at these mini

748
00:45:39,211 --> 00:45:42,030
failures I do along the
way and give me help.

749
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:47,130
So most people wouldn't even to guess
what the most important skill is.

750
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:51,750
In comedy, you would think the obvious,
which is humor. Now, by the way,

751
00:45:51,751 --> 00:45:55,590
humor itself is divided into a
bunch of different sub skills.

752
00:45:55,591 --> 00:45:57,620
Like how you write a,

753
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,530
a punchline is different than how
you tell a funny story. Public,

754
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:04,020
a funny story in public speaking,
it doesn't work.

755
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:07,710
Telling the same story in stand up comedy,
no one will laugh and kind of money.

756
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:11,100
Everyone will laugh and
public speaking. So, uh,

757
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:15,930
but the most important skill that many
comedians have told me is not humor but

758
00:46:15,931 --> 00:46:20,400
likability. And so that's why you
see many comics who are unknown.

759
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:24,540
They get on stage and they started
talking to the audience where you're from,

760
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:29,400
where they say, I grew up and I was
bullied and here's the worst bullying.

761
00:46:29,401 --> 00:46:30,960
And then they tried to
make a joke at the end,

762
00:46:30,961 --> 00:46:33,260
but they're self deprecating
in the beginning. So you,

763
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:38,320
the audience can relate a little bit. Um,
that's only one way to build likability.

764
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:41,880
There's other ways to build likability
and you're learning all those sub skills.

765
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:45,930
But like on business, I'll give you a
very important set of sub skills. So,

766
00:46:45,931 --> 00:46:49,950
obviously product development is
an important sub skill in business.

767
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:54,060
But most people think that's the only
skill. Oh, if we build a good product,

768
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:59,140
people buy the product. Vcs will invest
in money. Most. But I, I've done, uh,

769
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:01,170
hundreds of angel
investments at this point.

770
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:05,160
I'll tell you an incredibly important
skill that is different from any other

771
00:47:05,161 --> 00:47:06,090
skill in business.

772
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:11,420
But I won't invest unless I see the CEO
and maybe the other investors have this

773
00:47:12,031 --> 00:47:15,960
skill. It's really hard to
sell your company. So selling,

774
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:20,730
nobody wants to write you a
check that will make you rich.

775
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:23,730
Nobody wakes up in the morning and says,
you know what?

776
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:25,620
Today I'm going to make Jesse Rich.

777
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:29,560
Nobody has ever woken up and said
that in their lives. It's unfortunate.

778
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:34,000
No one has said it about
anybody. I'm so, so,

779
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:37,690
so having the ability to
convince somebody else.

780
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:43,020
Of course there is southern company
is not about making somebody rich.

781
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:45,490
But the reality is it is.

782
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:50,440
And so you ha so there's all sorts of
ways you have to have this skill to

783
00:47:50,441 --> 00:47:52,840
convince people to buy your company.

784
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:57,430
And that's 100% different skill than
raising money, than selling the products.

785
00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:01,930
Then managing employees, then sales, the
negotiations, then building a product.

786
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:03,610
All of these skills are important.

787
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:07,780
Dealing with a landlord is almost as an
important skill as developing a product,

788
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:12,130
uh, for various reasons that most
people would suspect. For instance,

789
00:48:12,131 --> 00:48:14,830
if Google bought a company
and I had a landlord,

790
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:19,810
my landlord has to approve that Goebbels,
the new tenant instead of me.

791
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:23,020
And if the landlord says, no,
you can't sell your company.

792
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:26,350
So there's all these little things that
most people don't think about when they

793
00:48:26,351 --> 00:48:28,480
start a company.
And I've seen so many,

794
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:32,800
it's been the cause of so many failures
of mine investing in the wrong set of

795
00:48:32,801 --> 00:48:36,670
skills. Uh, and now I ha
I have one trick for it,

796
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:41,770
which is I only invest in
alongside people smarter than me.

797
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:46,360
So I outsource my thinking to people
who have big research teams doing due

798
00:48:46,361 --> 00:48:50,200
diligence. And ideally the CEO has
built and sold the company before.

799
00:48:50,201 --> 00:48:53,800
So I know he's got the whole
skillset and so on. So,

800
00:48:53,801 --> 00:48:58,540
but these are some ways in
which failure has taught me.

801
00:48:58,541 --> 00:49:03,310
And I'll just give you one quote from,
so ray Dalio was on my podcast last week.

802
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,600
We haven't released the
podcast yet, but, um,

803
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:11,220
he is the founder and still runs
the largest hedge fund in the world,

804
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:15,560
is worth about, you know, he's
worth tens of billions. Uh, he,

805
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:17,350
he said in the podcast,

806
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,980
pain plus reflection equals progress.

807
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:24,580
And that's a very valuable quote
relating to all, all how, you know,

808
00:49:24,581 --> 00:49:26,650
how you hack these,
these 10,000 hours.

809
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:30,660
Yeah. I want to get to Q and
a and an a second real quick.

810
00:49:30,661 --> 00:49:34,410
I want to couple two questions. Sure.
Oh, I promise I'll answer more. No,

811
00:49:34,411 --> 00:49:38,070
you're all good. Um, so
the two questions are, uh,

812
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,560
what's your favorite podcasts
you've ever done and why?

813
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:43,740
And then the second question is,
what's your favorite life hack a,

814
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:44,700
or to put it a different way,

815
00:49:44,701 --> 00:49:48,210
what's the one thing these people can
do that will have the greatest kind of

816
00:49:48,211 --> 00:49:51,720
multiplicative effect, positive
effect on their, on their life,

817
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:54,480
whether it's sleep or
whatever. So, sure. All right.

818
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:58,440
So, uh, the, the, the greatest,
the best podcasts I've ever done.

819
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,320
It's really hard to answer cause I,

820
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:03,180
I learned so much from all
of these amazing people.

821
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:08,400
Like I dunno how many people grew up
on Judy Blume books. For instance.

822
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,230
Like I grew up reading,

823
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:14,610
Judy Blume was the best
children's writer in the 1970s.

824
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:16,680
You sold 150 million copies of her books.

825
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:21,510
And I would never have imagined when I
was in fifth grade or sixth grade that

826
00:50:21,511 --> 00:50:24,300
one day I was going to talk to Judy bloom.

827
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:26,460
Like that was an amazing moment for me.

828
00:50:26,461 --> 00:50:28,070
I know it doesn't like
the most amazing thing,

829
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:32,270
but usually the best pockets I've ever
had is my last podcast cause that's the

830
00:50:32,271 --> 00:50:34,280
one that's still so fresh in my memory.

831
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:37,820
And I'm thinking about it and I'm thinking
about the things they say. So again,

832
00:50:37,821 --> 00:50:40,940
Ray Dalia was the, the
last one I did, but I'll,

833
00:50:40,941 --> 00:50:45,860
I'll talk about the worst podcast I
ever did and what I learned from it. So,

834
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:50,310
uh, this was in 2014 I did
this podcast with, um, the,

835
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:54,770
the rapper Biz Markie to know Biz
Markie. He did that song, just a friend.

836
00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:59,630
It's a kind of like a popular
song. And I said to him, uh,

837
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:02,990
what's it like that everybody
knows you primarily,

838
00:51:02,991 --> 00:51:05,540
you've done a lot of songs and
albums and things in your life,

839
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:09,050
but everybody primarily
knows you from just a friend.

840
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:14,420
And he was very upset. He said, I've
done much more than just a friend.

841
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:18,530
And I said, that's true, but two
things I want to point out. One,

842
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:20,090
if I go to your website,

843
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:24,410
the e this song immediately
starts playing just,

844
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:29,390
and if I, if, if I were to go to
China right now and ask anybody,

845
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:32,120
do you know who Biz Markie is?
If they know you at all,

846
00:51:32,121 --> 00:51:36,630
they're going to sing just
to Fred. So he's like, yeah,
but I did Gaba, Gaba, Gaba,

847
00:51:36,631 --> 00:51:41,190
and Nickelodeon. And I did this song,
that song, and he hung up on me. And um,

848
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:46,730
so it's the only time I ever hung
up on me on a podcast. And so,

849
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:51,170
so I figured, okay, well it's not
so fun to just put this podcast up.

850
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:52,930
So what I did was I put,
I,

851
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:58,390
I had the audio engineer play the
podcast and then with another person,

852
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:03,320
we analyze what I did wrong
throughout this podcast.

853
00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:06,530
So we kept having the engineer rewind,
fast forward, rewind, fast forward.

854
00:52:06,531 --> 00:52:09,830
And we kept commenting how I could've
done a better job when this podcast,

855
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:13,820
so that, so I made it like a metal
podcast about doing this bad podcast.

856
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:18,200
So every,
everything is content,

857
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:22,430
every everything, you
know, process is art.

858
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:25,280
Just as much as the outcome.
The process of,

859
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:30,190
of the final outcome is artistic
in and of itself. You know, I,

860
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:34,970
we had scheduled at one point for
the podcast, Jordan Belfort, who's,

861
00:52:34,971 --> 00:52:39,050
uh, you know, he's famous for being the
wolf of Wall Street. He's a criminal.

862
00:52:39,051 --> 00:52:41,720
He wouldn't spend time in jail and
he's not, he's, he did his time,

863
00:52:41,721 --> 00:52:44,240
so I shouldn't say he was a criminally,
he spent time in jail,

864
00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:48,710
Leonardo Dicaprio place him in the movie.
But before the podcast,

865
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:53,720
he asked, slowly time I was ever asked
this, he asks his publicity team,

866
00:52:53,721 --> 00:52:55,610
I shouldn't say he,
his publicity team said,

867
00:52:55,611 --> 00:52:58,730
you need to submit all the questions
in advance. And I said, no,

868
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:01,040
that's like Soviet Russia did that.
Like,

869
00:53:01,041 --> 00:53:06,041
I'm not doing that and I'm going to
ask him whatever I want to ask him and

870
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:08,540
listen to my podcast.
I'm never mean to anybody on my pocket.

871
00:53:08,541 --> 00:53:11,990
It's not like I'm trying to trap somebody.
So chose me.

872
00:53:11,991 --> 00:53:16,700
They didn't do their work on my podcast
and, and I didn't want to in any way.

873
00:53:16,701 --> 00:53:18,890
It wasn't like he was a peak performer.
The guy was a criminal.

874
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:22,220
So he didn't want to, I didn't want
to have him on my podcast again.

875
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:27,520
He did his time. Not a criminal. I
have to say that legally. But, um,

876
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:30,870
but so was that a failure or a success?
Well,

877
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:35,670
I wrote an article mentioning that
I turned process into content.

878
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,160
It was an article that appeared
on 20 different platforms,

879
00:53:38,161 --> 00:53:41,940
got tens of thousands of views.
And I don't think he's a bad guy.

880
00:53:41,941 --> 00:53:45,160
He could have just been as
publicity team. I have no idea. But,

881
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:47,520
but everything I do that doesn't work out.

882
00:53:47,521 --> 00:53:52,290
I always figure out how do I take this
process and turn it into art in some

883
00:53:52,291 --> 00:53:55,650
other way or turn it into a business or
a turn it into an opportunity or turn it

884
00:53:55,651 --> 00:53:57,360
into an idea for somebody else.

885
00:53:57,570 --> 00:54:02,570
So I always repeat that to myself every
day processes art because whatever we

886
00:54:02,581 --> 00:54:06,960
do, however we falter, even if
I completely fail, for instance,

887
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:10,560
at comedy,
the process of failing,

888
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:15,590
like I've written about bombing and just
the process of how you deal with that

889
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:18,600
becomes art becomes, and for me, art,

890
00:54:18,601 --> 00:54:23,040
I write for for so many different things
and for so many different reasons,

891
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:26,910
you know, becomes connected to all my
other businesses and my all, you know.

892
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:31,170
So now, not only, not only am I
writing about bombing and comedy,

893
00:54:31,171 --> 00:54:33,330
but for one group of my readers,

894
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:36,450
I'm writing about failure and another
group of readers I'm writing about,

895
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:39,420
here's the metalanguage
of how to learn anything.

896
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:43,410
And part of the process of me learning
something that's a hard skill.

897
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:46,500
It doesn't matter what the skill is.
So there's so many different levels.

898
00:54:46,501 --> 00:54:49,410
When you treat processes, art, there's
so many different ways you can,

899
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:53,070
you can use that to create new works of
art that have nothing to do with how you

900
00:54:53,071 --> 00:54:55,200
started.
So that's incredibly valuable.

901
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:59,330
So I think that was the answer
to what's my theory of podcasts.

902
00:54:59,850 --> 00:55:04,170
So I took that Biz Markie experience and
I made art out of it in a different way

903
00:55:04,171 --> 00:55:06,000
than was than I had initially expected.

904
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:10,320
And then your second question was
lifehack favorite one. Okay. I,

905
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:14,310
and this happened to me
even yesterday. Uh, uh,

906
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:16,350
somebody comes up to me and says,

907
00:55:16,351 --> 00:55:19,980
I read that 10 night year at your
suggestion of doing 10 ideas a day.

908
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:24,750
I thought it was nothing. You know,
the best life hacks are not like, oh,

909
00:55:24,870 --> 00:55:29,870
inject this super soldier serum into your
arm and you're going to become captain

910
00:55:29,971 --> 00:55:34,200
America. Like the best life hacks are
simple ones that people don't realize.

911
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:39,860
The compound effect of it
over time becomes a miracle.

912
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:45,350
And so writing 10 ideas a day improves
your idea muscle and strengthens your

913
00:55:45,871 --> 00:55:48,240
idea muscle 1% a day.

914
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:52,860
1% a day compounded is 3800% a year,

915
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:57,180
billions of percent over 10 years.
So you're going to be like,

916
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:02,300
your ability to compete against everyone
else becomes so powerful over time,

917
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:06,930
even over the course of a year,
even look over the course of three months.

918
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,940
If you just write 10 ideas a day,

919
00:56:08,941 --> 00:56:11,280
and someone came up to me and
told me this yesterday, he said,

920
00:56:11,281 --> 00:56:12,690
I didn't think this would be anything.

921
00:56:12,690 --> 00:56:15,990
I figure I'll try it for a couple of
weeks. And he said it was like magic.

922
00:56:15,991 --> 00:56:20,550
What happened? It'll create so many
opportunities. It will create so many,

923
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:24,130
whether it's businesses or
skills or relationships,

924
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:27,820
or if you want to meet your
future wife or husband,

925
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:31,870
it's this one thing, and I'm not, I'm
not even advising people to do it.

926
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:34,150
This is what it's done for me and it's,
it's in.

927
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:38,170
It's the result of that have been
incredible. Then number two, of course,

928
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:40,990
is um,
uh,

929
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:44,980
making sure no toxic people
are in your life. You cannot,

930
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:47,800
you cannot cure a toxic person.

931
00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:53,010
You could only remove yourself from their
presence and so be around people you

932
00:56:53,171 --> 00:56:58,130
love and who love you. I know it
sounds corny or Cliche, but the,

933
00:56:58,210 --> 00:57:02,610
you know, I, he even described it
in a simple way as a hack, you know,

934
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:07,210
to take between four and 8,000
hours out of the 10,000 hour rule.

935
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:10,900
It's so incredibly
important. Uh, uh, you know,

936
00:57:10,901 --> 00:57:14,350
those two things alone are,
are, if you just do that,

937
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:17,710
your life's going to change
almost overnight. And, you know,

938
00:57:17,711 --> 00:57:20,200
we keep toxic people in our
lives all the time. We think, oh,

939
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:23,740
I have to deal with this person because
they're my cousin or my neighbor,

940
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:27,600
or they're my friend since,
since high school. Well,

941
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,890
let me tell you something
that's important about that.

942
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:33,280
The guy who lives in another
town who you never see,

943
00:57:33,370 --> 00:57:35,290
that's never the toxic
person in your life.

944
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:40,170
It's always the people close to you that
you think you can't get away from the

945
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:44,110
toxic people in your life. And that's the
hard thing for people to realize. Oh No,

946
00:57:44,111 --> 00:57:48,940
that's my, my grandma.
I can't avoid her. Well,

947
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:52,690
I'm sorry. That's, you can't have
taught you only live one life.

948
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:56,710
Are you going to spend a big percentage
of it with somebody who is going to ruin

949
00:57:56,711 --> 00:58:00,340
your life? Anyway, that's, I don't
want to end on a negative note though.

950
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:01,760
Uh,

951
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:06,840
so I won't say the 10 ideas a day and
being around people you love and who love

952
00:58:07,061 --> 00:58:07,720
you,

953
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:12,720
that hacks really the 10,000 hour rule
because that allows you to take failure

954
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:17,680
and just fling yourself onto your idea
machine and onto these people who love

955
00:58:17,681 --> 00:58:22,510
you and they are the safety net
that will bounce you back up.

956
00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:27,690
Awesome. Do you guys
have any questions? Yeah.

957
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:32,940
You alluded to family and I was just
wondering in these tumultuous ups and

958
00:58:32,941 --> 00:58:33,510
downs,

959
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:38,510
how it affected your children or how did
you protect them or was that part of,

960
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:43,050
did you want them to be part
of that and then, um, yeah,

961
00:58:43,110 --> 00:58:46,790
that's great question.
So the question is, um,

962
00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:51,760
when I was having these ups and downs
and they happen maybe four or five times,

963
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:52,511
let's say three,

964
00:58:52,511 --> 00:58:56,920
where I went completely broke to
the point where I lost a home.

965
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,220
We'll had tax issues.
You know,

966
00:59:00,221 --> 00:59:03,410
was really depressed and suicidal.
Um,

967
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:07,750
and then there were other times
kind of in between. And, uh,

968
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:11,240
how did this affect my family,
particularly my children's,

969
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:15,610
I had two daughters and now they're older.
Um,

970
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:20,440
I suppose ultimately, um, they would
know better than me how it affected them,

971
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:23,060
but I very hard to um,

972
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:28,550
be positive around them and not let them
see how things were affecting me and

973
00:59:28,551 --> 00:59:32,060
tried to put things in the best possible
light. I suppose that to some extent,

974
00:59:32,061 --> 00:59:34,710
having two daughters for me personally,
uh,

975
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:39,790
inspired me on a couple of ways to keep
going for their sake and to show them

976
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:42,080
that this is as an,
you can't,

977
00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:47,090
you can't teach by telling somebody do
this. You could only teach by example.

978
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:49,070
And I hope,

979
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:52,520
I don't know what the final result
will be there 18 and 15 now,

980
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:56,480
but I hope that by examples for all
these years they turn out to be,

981
00:59:56,481 --> 00:59:58,430
and so far so good,
they turned out to be good adults,

982
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,060
but I always tried to
buffer them from everything.

983
01:00:02,210 --> 01:00:06,140
I'm sure it worked to some extent.
It didn't work for others.

984
01:00:06,410 --> 01:00:10,090
Maybe in some ways they're more anxious
about things than I, than I realized.

985
01:00:10,091 --> 01:00:12,080
But again, time will tell you. I,

986
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:14,960
I did think of it though
and being aware of it is,

987
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:19,250
is the first solution and just doing the
best you can is after that is important.

988
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:24,290
But I wouldn't like, I wouldn't like
shake them and say, you're two years old,

989
01:00:24,291 --> 01:00:27,830
we're going broke.
I would never do anything like that.

990
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:31,940
I did get for better or for worse.
I,

991
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:34,160
we are mother and I did
get divorced though.

992
01:00:34,161 --> 01:00:35,840
I don't know if it was
related to all my failures,

993
01:00:35,841 --> 01:00:38,660
but I certainly wouldn't want to
be married to me at that point. So

994
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:44,000
any other question? Yeah. Hold on one sec.

995
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:50,050
Uh, in 2018, what's your
thoughts on going to college?

996
01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:54,040
2018. What's my thoughts are
going on, going to college,

997
01:00:54,130 --> 01:00:58,090
the same as my thoughts in 2005.
So in 2005,

998
01:00:58,091 --> 01:01:01,710
I was a columnist for the
Financial Times and um,

999
01:01:02,110 --> 01:01:06,340
I wrote this article why nobody
should ever go to college again.

1000
01:01:06,790 --> 01:01:10,020
And at the time I was the
only person saying it. Um,

1001
01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:13,240
and there was lots of people
trashing me on different blogs.

1002
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:17,990
I actually lost some good
friendships over this. And um,

1003
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:21,040
now I think it's a more viable discussion,
right?

1004
01:01:21,041 --> 01:01:24,970
I think people can't have this discussion
without being slaughtered by everybody

1005
01:01:24,971 --> 01:01:28,540
else. But, um, the way I see it is

1006
01:01:30,310 --> 01:01:32,980
in college so many,
you know,

1007
01:01:33,550 --> 01:01:38,550
tuitions have gone up faster than
inflation every single year since 1977,

1008
01:01:40,650 --> 01:01:43,930
but every single year there hasn't been
one year where inflation went up higher

1009
01:01:43,931 --> 01:01:48,490
then tuitions. And in part that's
because the government backs, you know,

1010
01:01:48,491 --> 01:01:53,491
we'll lend you money against your tuition
and it's the one kind of loan you,

1011
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:56,710
you can't get rid of in a bankruptcy.
So of course,

1012
01:01:56,711 --> 01:02:00,580
let's give it to every 18 year old
who's totally unqualified to borrow this

1013
01:02:00,581 --> 01:02:04,450
money. So you create
this skewed, you know,

1014
01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:08,890
there's already this problem
in, in society where, you know,

1015
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:11,980
rich people get certain benefits.
I don't mean to sound,

1016
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,440
this is not a political bias.
This is the truth.

1017
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:18,370
Rich people have certain
benefits and poor people don't,

1018
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:21,540
and a d and that divide
gets greater and greater.

1019
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:25,170
And that's why we have all this political
strife right now more than ever before.

1020
01:02:25,171 --> 01:02:25,950
We have all these,

1021
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:30,950
these political enemies like half of
Facebook hates the other half of Facebook

1022
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:34,500
and vice versa because of
these political problems.

1023
01:02:34,890 --> 01:02:36,630
And uh,

1024
01:02:37,110 --> 01:02:40,560
I think in part it's created by
some kids go to Harvard and they,

1025
01:02:40,561 --> 01:02:45,480
and they see their parents can pay for
it and other kids borrow $200,000 to go

1026
01:02:45,481 --> 01:02:48,390
to a worse school.
And meanwhile,

1027
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:52,320
there's plenty of places online
to learn faster and better.

1028
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:56,760
There's so many online
educational resources to learn
more than you would have

1029
01:02:56,761 --> 01:03:00,200
learned in college that
I don't understand why,

1030
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:05,210
why 100% of kids don't just learn for
free better and start making money and

1031
01:03:06,181 --> 01:03:10,950
don't go into debt? It seems to me like
a no brainer. Just thinking about it now,

1032
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:15,270
I have an 18 year old and so
she was a senior last year,

1033
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:18,660
which foreshadowing and

1034
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:25,350
I had, I kept saying to her
throughout her whole high school,

1035
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:28,680
we need to have this conversation.
You're not going to college.

1036
01:03:29,070 --> 01:03:33,390
And she would just, which wasn't really a
conversation, right? It's like a command.

1037
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:38,640
And she would literally just turn around
and start walking away. And I would say,

1038
01:03:38,641 --> 01:03:39,780
don't walk away from me.

1039
01:03:39,810 --> 01:03:42,750
It's like the only time I've ever got
angry about her was like on the topic of

1040
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:47,040
college. So I'm like, don't walk away
from me. We're in the middle of a mall.

1041
01:03:47,041 --> 01:03:51,630
I want to argue with you in front
of all these people. And uh, Eh,

1042
01:03:51,690 --> 01:03:53,640
cause that's the only time we spend
time together was when she was,

1043
01:03:53,670 --> 01:03:58,410
I would take her shopping and uh,
you know,

1044
01:03:58,411 --> 01:04:02,820
but I realized, I realized
several things. One is,

1045
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,250
you know,
a,

1046
01:04:05,251 --> 01:04:08,370
I wasn't being a very good father if she
didn't feel comfortable having a very

1047
01:04:08,371 --> 01:04:10,530
basic conversation with me.
So again,

1048
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:16,040
I had to parent by example and show
openmindedness and listen to her,

1049
01:04:16,381 --> 01:04:20,070
what she wanted to do with her life
and offer her a real alternatives.

1050
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:21,390
I even wrote a book,

1051
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:26,280
bought 40 alternatives to college and I
self published it and she did not read

1052
01:04:26,281 --> 01:04:27,320
the book.
Um,

1053
01:04:29,410 --> 01:04:33,870
but so one time I said to her,
look, what do you want to be?

1054
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:37,620
And she,
I know she's going to see this on a video,

1055
01:04:37,621 --> 01:04:42,540
but she lied to me, I suspect. And she
said, oh, I want to be a neurobiologist.

1056
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:43,680
And I'm like,

1057
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:48,680
you have never once spoken to me about
anything relating to neuro or biology or

1058
01:04:52,201 --> 01:04:55,170
any igg or any nerve.

1059
01:04:56,430 --> 01:05:00,510
You're just not interested in this. You
want to, you're interested in chemistry,

1060
01:05:00,511 --> 01:05:01,770
are you interested in statistics?

1061
01:05:01,771 --> 01:05:04,050
So you understand understanding all of
these sub things are going to have to

1062
01:05:04,051 --> 01:05:06,030
learn. And she's like,
yeah, yeah, I'm interested.

1063
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:10,050
And so I would buy her neuro biology
books. Did you read it? Never read it.

1064
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:15,060
So, um, but I knew she, since
she was in kindergarten,

1065
01:05:15,061 --> 01:05:19,870
she's been in every single performance
in her school ever. Like, so I'm like,

1066
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:23,080
you want to be an actor?
Why don't you,

1067
01:05:23,290 --> 01:05:26,920
why don't you act?
And I'm like,

1068
01:05:26,921 --> 01:05:30,160
well you have to go to college to go
major in agony. I'm like, no, you don't.

1069
01:05:30,610 --> 01:05:34,030
The first skill had acting
as learning how to audition.

1070
01:05:34,270 --> 01:05:36,580
So here's what we're going to do.
This is what I offered her.

1071
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:40,450
I am going to give you in cash.
It's like a brick of cash,

1072
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:45,220
the tuition I would have paid to
that school. You're going to, um,

1073
01:05:45,310 --> 01:05:46,360
the president of that school.

1074
01:05:46,361 --> 01:05:48,700
Just a great to go out on the podcast
so I shouldn't make fun of it.

1075
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:52,090
And uh,

1076
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:56,410
and all you have to do is watch
a movie with me every morning.

1077
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:57,870
We'll pick a different movie every day.

1078
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,790
Just have to watch one movie with me
every morning and then spend the rest of

1079
01:06:00,791 --> 01:06:04,930
the day going on auditions because
you'll learn how to, you'll learn a,

1080
01:06:04,931 --> 01:06:06,370
if you like the lifestyle,
be,

1081
01:06:06,371 --> 01:06:09,400
you'll learn how to get better at
auditions when you're 18 instead of when

1082
01:06:09,401 --> 01:06:14,230
you're 23. Um, see you won't have
any kind of debt or you know,

1083
01:06:14,231 --> 01:06:18,880
you were saying I would have saved
an enormous amount of money. Uh,

1084
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:21,520
and you'll just be that much
ahead of all your peers.

1085
01:06:21,521 --> 01:06:24,790
You'll learn so much more about acting.
Actually being in New York, I have no,

1086
01:06:24,791 --> 01:06:28,930
I've had like Broadway producers and
other producers on my podcast is one call

1087
01:06:28,931 --> 01:06:31,780
for me to get you. Oh, this is,
that's the real advantage you have.

1088
01:06:32,110 --> 01:06:36,220
And might as well take advantage
of it. And she said, no.

1089
01:06:36,850 --> 01:06:40,390
Uh, instead she decided to go to
college, which she's enjoying very much.

1090
01:06:40,690 --> 01:06:45,690
And so I'm against it and
she's an adult and I figured,

1091
01:06:46,031 --> 01:06:48,200
okay, I still want to, I don't know.

1092
01:06:48,201 --> 01:06:49,930
I don't know if I did the
right thing or the wrong thing,

1093
01:06:49,931 --> 01:06:53,530
but I wanted to be supportive of her.
Now she's deciding what to major in,

1094
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:55,390
at least major in acting.

1095
01:06:55,391 --> 01:06:59,500
So you learn a real skill that you're
interested in and not learn some something

1096
01:06:59,501 --> 01:07:02,050
like neurobiology, which I know
you're not interested, it's not,

1097
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:06,580
it's not like being a neuroscientist
is a fall back profession. You know,

1098
01:07:06,730 --> 01:07:10,630
just learn an actual skill.
It's very hard to learn acting.

1099
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:15,340
And then you could see if you want to
be an actor and come to New York now

1100
01:07:15,341 --> 01:07:18,160
people will say, well what
if, uh, you know, what if,

1101
01:07:18,161 --> 01:07:20,410
what's she going to do later on
if it doesn't work out as acting?

1102
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:23,350
Does anyone here, actually this
is a different sort of place,

1103
01:07:23,351 --> 01:07:27,460
but most people I know don't actually
do what they learned in college.

1104
01:07:27,790 --> 01:07:31,750
I was a computer science major.
I went to Grad School of computer science.

1105
01:07:31,990 --> 01:07:34,960
And then my first real job
doing computer programming,

1106
01:07:35,350 --> 01:07:37,930
I was so bad at programming.

1107
01:07:38,170 --> 01:07:43,090
I had to go to remedial programming
classes for two months just to be at the

1108
01:07:43,091 --> 01:07:45,910
lowest level of my job at programming.

1109
01:07:46,210 --> 01:07:49,960
I went to an ivy league undergraduate
school for computer science and I went to

1110
01:07:49,961 --> 01:07:53,980
a top two or three graduate school
for computer science. Again,

1111
01:07:53,981 --> 01:07:56,980
many employees that are here
went to the same graduate school.

1112
01:07:56,981 --> 01:08:01,790
I know they were in my class and uh,
it didn't help me.

1113
01:08:01,791 --> 01:08:03,070
Only the real world helps you.

1114
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:07,720
So that's my 2 cents on 2018 pay.

1115
01:08:07,721 --> 01:08:12,000
Ya Anybody? No, don't go to, uh,

1116
01:08:12,190 --> 01:08:14,050
let's pass the mic over there possible.

1117
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:19,260
Um,

1118
01:08:19,260 --> 01:08:24,180
what's your biggest insight
on a relationship and dating
that most people don't

1119
01:08:24,181 --> 01:08:25,014
realize?

1120
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:29,630
Biggest insight on relationship and dating
that most people don't realize and to

1121
01:08:29,631 --> 01:08:32,390
qualify,
I'm really not an expert,

1122
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:37,490
but I will tell you a couple of
things I've learned through failure.

1123
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:41,900
And then a couple of things I'm trying
to guess. Uh, as I go along, first off,

1124
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:45,350
I don't know if you remember this book
of roles. It was written in the 90s,

1125
01:08:45,351 --> 01:08:48,560
sold 3 million copies. Um, great book. Uh,

1126
01:08:48,650 --> 01:08:50,690
these two women wrote about dating.

1127
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:54,560
They were all my podcast recently and I'm
not going to discuss their Bob, but um,

1128
01:08:55,070 --> 01:09:00,070
they gave me advice and bear
advice to me was do online dating.

1129
01:09:00,950 --> 01:09:05,600
And I said, no, I'm never going to
do online dating. And they said,

1130
01:09:05,601 --> 01:09:08,330
why not? And I said, you know,

1131
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:13,360
everything is related to supply
and demand. The value of how you,

1132
01:09:13,370 --> 01:09:15,950
of how you look at something is
always related to supply and demand.

1133
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:19,040
I sort of feel for me personally,

1134
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:24,290
that online dating creates this
illusion of infinite supply.

1135
01:09:24,770 --> 01:09:29,180
So it reduces the value
for me of a relationship,

1136
01:09:29,450 --> 01:09:33,710
a long term relationship. Now, short
term, who knows? That's not what I go for.

1137
01:09:33,711 --> 01:09:36,620
I go for our longterm and for me,

1138
01:09:36,621 --> 01:09:40,910
I feel like having just the feeling of
infant and supply will, oh, I don't,

1139
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:45,370
this person doesn't like Chinese food.
Swipe out onto the next one. So this,

1140
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:49,880
this, this value I place on
really getting to know somebody.

1141
01:09:50,210 --> 01:09:53,290
So I prefer, uh, uh, I,

1142
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:58,540
I prefer meaning somebody through friends
or through some sort of interactions.

1143
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:00,890
But, um, uh,

1144
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:04,780
the other thing that's really
important is it's okay for PE.

1145
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:09,880
You have to have anger compatibility
with who you go out with.

1146
01:10:10,650 --> 01:10:15,230
If you ever have that relationship where
you're arguing over here and they're

1147
01:10:15,231 --> 01:10:18,350
arguing over here and
somehow you're like trending,

1148
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:21,200
I don't understand what you're saying.
You just said this,

1149
01:10:21,201 --> 01:10:23,390
but now you're saying like, you
don't, you're not compatible.

1150
01:10:23,391 --> 01:10:25,640
And the way you're arguing,
there's something completely,

1151
01:10:25,641 --> 01:10:29,270
some line of communication completely
off. Now, many people will say, well,

1152
01:10:29,271 --> 01:10:30,830
that happens in every relationship,

1153
01:10:31,250 --> 01:10:34,190
but I've seen plenty of relationships
where that never happens. And they,

1154
01:10:34,191 --> 01:10:38,720
they argue, and maybe they
argued for a serious argument,

1155
01:10:38,990 --> 01:10:43,430
but somehow they resolve it. So I think
anger compatibility is, is important.

1156
01:10:43,790 --> 01:10:48,170
The other thing, um, the
other thing I will say is,

1157
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:53,840
uh, it's one thing when two people are
able to support each other through hard

1158
01:10:53,841 --> 01:10:58,150
times. If, if you're in a relationship
with somebody and they get sick, you're,

1159
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:01,700
you help them through hard
times or they fail in business,

1160
01:11:01,701 --> 01:11:06,500
which happens to me regularly, you'd
help me through hard times. And um,

1161
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:09,830
but that is not the
important thing to note.

1162
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:14,550
The important thing to really ask is
does this other person helped me through

1163
01:11:14,551 --> 01:11:19,200
successful times?
So let's say you were dating somebody who,

1164
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:24,310
I'll just use the actress
example. Oh, they say to you, uh,

1165
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:26,280
I just got to acting gig.

1166
01:11:26,430 --> 01:11:31,430
I'm going to Costar and oceans 18 with
Brad Pitt and I've got a kit kiss Brad

1167
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:35,610
Pitt in the middle of the movie.
Now,

1168
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:40,080
if I think a really good thing is to
be supportive of them achieving their

1169
01:11:40,081 --> 01:11:43,770
dreams, you know, and they will
in turn will be supportive of you.

1170
01:11:43,771 --> 01:11:48,600
And that's a sign of an extremely healthy
relationship that will last forever.

1171
01:11:48,601 --> 01:11:52,200
And there's even studies that show that
that's the type of relationship that

1172
01:11:52,201 --> 01:11:52,891
will last forever,

1173
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:56,640
even more so than the people who help
each other during hard times is the people

1174
01:11:56,641 --> 01:11:59,490
who support each other during
successful times. So I think,

1175
01:11:59,610 --> 01:12:00,690
I think that's really important.

1176
01:12:00,990 --> 01:12:05,490
And then finally I will quote
a good friend of mine. Um,

1177
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:09,630
I've had both him and his
wife and my podcast. Uh,

1178
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:12,420
basically he said to me,

1179
01:12:12,510 --> 01:12:15,990
the most important decision you'll ever
make for your career is who you decide

1180
01:12:15,991 --> 01:12:19,140
to spend the rest of your life with.
And I really do agree with that.

1181
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:23,790
Who was that person? Uh,
so it's Brian Koppelman who
created it. He wrote rounders,

1182
01:12:24,150 --> 01:12:28,620
ocean's 13. Speaking of oceans, he wrote
one of my favorite movies, a solitary man.

1183
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:32,370
He writes the TV show billions
and his wife Amy Koppelman,

1184
01:12:32,371 --> 01:12:35,220
she's written three excellent
novels. Uh, plus the movie.

1185
01:12:35,221 --> 01:12:38,400
I smile back starring Sarah
Silverman and they have a really,

1186
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:41,800
they've been together forever.
They've really, they've it.

1187
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:44,280
And he was the one that we
were giving a talk at a,

1188
01:12:44,910 --> 01:12:49,050
I was interviewing him at
another company and uh, uh,

1189
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:52,710
he said this to me either in the talk
or maybe when we were on the plane.

1190
01:12:52,711 --> 01:12:57,010
I forget, but I remember it though. Do
you want to take the final question?

1191
01:12:59,670 --> 01:13:03,990
So I'm super curious about this
and I just felt like I had to ask.

1192
01:13:03,991 --> 01:13:06,180
So I was going to, first of all,
I was going to ask you like,

1193
01:13:06,181 --> 01:13:10,110
what are you most proud of? And then I
was like, no, I'm more curious about this.

1194
01:13:10,111 --> 01:13:11,560
And I'm lucky,

1195
01:13:11,990 --> 01:13:13,480
I'm most proud of speaking here at Google.

1196
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:14,793
Awesome.

1197
01:13:17,350 --> 01:13:20,950
Google. Oh my God, I'm
speaking in. Thank you so much.

1198
01:13:20,951 --> 01:13:24,540
I'm speaking in front of the best
company in the world and, and,

1199
01:13:24,570 --> 01:13:28,780
and just to add to that, Google is
such a great, I'm going to interrupt.

1200
01:13:28,781 --> 01:13:29,800
You're asking your questions.

1201
01:13:30,850 --> 01:13:34,960
Is that okay on time or so Google,

1202
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:39,640
there's one aspect of global that
is such an important lesson in life.

1203
01:13:40,390 --> 01:13:44,230
When you go to Google, what was
this one page website, right?

1204
01:13:44,231 --> 01:13:45,190
When you're the search engine,

1205
01:13:45,191 --> 01:13:50,191
I'm talking about google.com you go to
Google and Google has nothing on it.

1206
01:13:50,770 --> 01:13:55,270
There is nothing, there's nothing
there. It's if you want to,

1207
01:13:55,450 --> 01:13:57,040
but what you do is you type in,
Oh,

1208
01:13:57,041 --> 01:14:01,420
I want to learn about motorcycles
and Google will as fast as possible.

1209
01:14:01,690 --> 01:14:05,230
It'll literally say to you,
I don't know anything about motorcycles,

1210
01:14:05,590 --> 01:14:07,810
but we've determined for you.

1211
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:12,100
Here's our 10 favorite sites
and 400 more if you want,

1212
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:14,500
but here's the 10 favorite
sites about motorcycles.

1213
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:17,380
Why don't you go to one of them?
And so they get you off of,

1214
01:14:17,381 --> 01:14:20,230
they measure success by how
you guys measure success,

1215
01:14:20,231 --> 01:14:23,650
by how fast the customer
leaves the website.

1216
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:28,930
So now if you want to find out about,
I dunno,

1217
01:14:29,050 --> 01:14:33,100
tennis, uh, where do you go? Well,

1218
01:14:33,101 --> 01:14:34,300
I remember that other site,

1219
01:14:34,330 --> 01:14:38,290
google.com was so good at helping
me find out on motorcycles.

1220
01:14:38,530 --> 01:14:42,640
I'm going to go back to Google to find
out about tennis. So once the life lesson,

1221
01:14:42,670 --> 01:14:46,150
if you're the source and
you're willing to just, hey,

1222
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:49,150
you don't have to give me any money.
You don't owe me anything.

1223
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:50,860
You never even have to come back here.

1224
01:14:50,950 --> 01:14:52,870
Maybe this is the last
time you and I meet,

1225
01:14:53,110 --> 01:14:57,250
but I'm going to still give you my all
and send you to the best resources.

1226
01:14:58,090 --> 01:15:00,790
Who are you going to go back to?
You're going to go back to the source,

1227
01:15:00,791 --> 01:15:05,440
which is global. That's such a gift,
credit, wherever you can give ideas,

1228
01:15:05,441 --> 01:15:07,450
wherever you can always be the source,

1229
01:15:07,451 --> 01:15:12,451
be the be the Bank of knowledge and
information and giving and then everybody

1230
01:15:12,671 --> 01:15:15,970
comes back to you again and again.
And that's, and that's the goal.

1231
01:15:16,090 --> 01:15:18,460
That's why I'm so proud to speak here.
What's your question?

1232
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:21,160
Ooh,
that was really nice.

1233
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:25,810
My question and when I'm most
curious about is what is,

1234
01:15:25,811 --> 01:15:29,560
what is the story behind your hair?
Like honestly, no lie. The first,

1235
01:15:29,590 --> 01:15:33,790
the first article I ever read by you,
I was just like, wow, this person,

1236
01:15:33,970 --> 01:15:37,810
he looks very interesting and a little
funny looking like maybe I'll read this

1237
01:15:37,811 --> 01:15:41,500
article and see how it is. So,
uh, I'm just always been curious.

1238
01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:46,480
So I've always been curious
cause it makes you stand up.

1239
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:50,860
I worked in a cubicle, I kept it,
had worn a suit or ball, went on TV.

1240
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:53,560
I used to go on CNBC a lot.
I kept it short.

1241
01:15:53,950 --> 01:15:58,060
Now I work from home most of the time
and they don't really pay that much.

1242
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:03,730
I just go a little wild.
So I had to do, you know,

1243
01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:08,830
most of the activities I do don't
really require me to, I don't know,

1244
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:13,900
I'm not dressed up or anything. I have
only a few outfits to my name, you know,

1245
01:16:13,901 --> 01:16:15,370
for a long time I only had,

1246
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:20,290
I would never have more than 15
possessions to my name. And, uh, I can,

1247
01:16:20,350 --> 01:16:23,410
I didn't really consider
myself a minimalist. I just
didn't want to own anything.

1248
01:16:23,411 --> 01:16:24,760
I didn't want to think about anything.

1249
01:16:25,030 --> 01:16:27,280
So I didn't want to think of
anything except the things I loved.

1250
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:31,600
And it's just part of
that. I just, um, you know,

1251
01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:35,540
I just live the life I want to. I
want to live and nothing, I don't,

1252
01:16:35,610 --> 01:16:39,460
I don't need extra
frills, so, I dunno. No.

1253
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:43,810
Anything you want to plug before
we go? No, I'm just happy.

1254
01:16:43,811 --> 01:16:48,130
I'm really super excited. You invited
me to be here. I'll, I'll promote your,

1255
01:16:48,131 --> 01:16:52,380
your dad's toolbox. Can I do that?
She shit tools is a great book. Uh,

1256
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:56,140
I honestly, to be honest, I read the
second book, but I forget the title.

1257
01:16:56,141 --> 01:17:00,430
I have a really bad coming alive,
coming alive and great book. Uh,

1258
01:17:00,431 --> 01:17:02,770
I think we were planning on having
him on the podcast at some point.

1259
01:17:03,110 --> 01:17:07,000
Scrapebox I really enjoyed that.
I really enjoyed both, but I will,

1260
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:10,380
can I say one more thing about memory and
is it related to gold? Gold too? Yeah.

1261
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:11,560
So,
um,

1262
01:17:11,780 --> 01:17:15,560
I'm always constantly worried because I'm
preparing so much for podcasts and for

1263
01:17:15,561 --> 01:17:18,260
other things.
I really forget a lot of things.

1264
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:22,520
I'll even be like out on a day and
I'll forget the name of the woman,

1265
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:27,150
even if I've been dating her
for months. So, uh, which, so,

1266
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:30,830
so one time I signed up for 23
in me, um, which is, you know,

1267
01:17:30,831 --> 01:17:34,430
indirectly I think Google was an investor
or Google ventures is, or I don't know,

1268
01:17:34,431 --> 01:17:38,060
there's some connection there. And, um, I,

1269
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:41,590
I had the gene, I did the test, uh,

1270
01:17:41,810 --> 01:17:44,090
the DNA tests and I had the gene,
oh,

1271
01:17:44,091 --> 01:17:47,360
there's a little bit extra chance you
could have early onset Alzheimer's,

1272
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:51,950
which is a BS statistic.
If you have a 0.001%,

1273
01:17:52,310 --> 01:17:56,300
20% more chance doesn't really mean
anything. It's not, it's how they always,

1274
01:17:56,301 --> 01:17:59,630
doctors always scare people. But, uh,

1275
01:17:59,690 --> 01:18:04,070
so I wrote to the CEO at the time
and I said, oh, there's all these,

1276
01:18:04,071 --> 01:18:04,791
I did some research.

1277
01:18:04,791 --> 01:18:08,900
There's all these foods you can eat
to delay the onset of Alzheimer's.

1278
01:18:09,110 --> 01:18:13,600
How about I write the,
um, the [inaudible],

1279
01:18:13,610 --> 01:18:18,470
which is like the gene, how about I
write the [inaudible] cookbook and,

1280
01:18:18,530 --> 01:18:22,250
uh, you know, recommending all
these, you know, Alzheimer's foods.

1281
01:18:22,610 --> 01:18:26,930
And she wrote back instantly that book
would be a bestseller. You know, why?

1282
01:18:26,990 --> 01:18:29,820
And I wrote back why, and she said, uh,

1283
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:31,430
because no one would remember
if they had already, yeah.

1284
01:18:31,470 --> 01:18:35,250
Bought it. I gave, I gave credit to her.

1285
01:18:37,110 --> 01:18:39,720
Thank you so much for coming.
I appreciate it.

1286
01:18:39,890 --> 01:18:40,040
Yeah.
