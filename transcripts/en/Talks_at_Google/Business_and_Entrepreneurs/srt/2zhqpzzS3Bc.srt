1
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:06,950
Yeah.

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:11,330
My name is heath row and I'm research
operations manager for the brand studio of

3
00:00:11,331 --> 00:00:14,270
Google.
And we're here today with Jason Calacanis.

4
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:17,150
Jason is a technology entrepreneur,

5
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:21,710
angel investor and the host of a weekly
podcast called this week in startups.

6
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,550
He's the founder of a series
of conferences that bring
entrepreneurs together

7
00:00:25,551 --> 00:00:26,930
with potential investors.

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,480
And he was a scout for top tier
silicon valley venture capital firms,

9
00:00:31,481 --> 00:00:35,300
sequoia capital. He lives in
San Francisco, California.

10
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:39,620
Used to live down this way in southern
California and is author of a relatively

11
00:00:39,621 --> 00:00:41,840
new book.
It's about a month old called angel,

12
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,510
how to invest in technology startups,

13
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:49,570
timeless advice from an angel investor
who turned $100,000 into $100 million

14
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,820
published in July by Harper business.

15
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:58,040
I've known Jason for probably 20 years
now. Haven't seen him for ever and a day.

16
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,360
So it's good to have you here,
Jason. Thanks for having me. Heath.

17
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,860
And we were journalists together
back in the day that we were covering

18
00:01:03,861 --> 00:01:07,070
technology. Well, let's start
theirs cause I first met you.

19
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,870
It wasn't photocopied when I met you,

20
00:01:08,871 --> 00:01:13,490
but silicon alley reporter you went on
to digital coast reporter web blogs,

21
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:14,660
Netscape,
Mahalo.

22
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:19,370
That journalism is all generally
focusing on the gathering,

23
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:24,120
curation and promotion of ideas
and powerful ideas. Yeah, I was,

24
00:01:24,121 --> 00:01:28,430
I'm lucky enough to be in New York
when the Internet hit in 1994,

25
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,920
95 CD roms were becoming
a big deal and multimedia.

26
00:01:31,921 --> 00:01:34,650
And then all of a sudden the Internet
became commercialized with the Netscape

27
00:01:34,651 --> 00:01:36,330
browser supporting images.

28
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,110
And I started a Zeen Chris back then too,

29
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,910
if you want it to be
important in the world,

30
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,890
the real startup idea you had was the xen
and xen just meant a magazine that was

31
00:01:46,891 --> 00:01:49,800
not professionally produced,
but that was literally a photocopied.

32
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,390
And so after starting that photocopy
xen silicon alley reporter,

33
00:01:53,391 --> 00:01:58,391
it quickly grew into a print magazine
and have 300 pages and I got caught up in

34
00:01:58,471 --> 00:02:02,370
the whole.com sort of wave of innovation.
And so I got very lucky.

35
00:02:02,371 --> 00:02:07,371
But being a journalist is a great way to
learn how to interview founders and to

36
00:02:07,621 --> 00:02:11,880
cut through bs. And, um, you're
kind of a detective, right?

37
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,090
Like when you're a journalist,
you have to ask questions,

38
00:02:15,091 --> 00:02:18,300
let the person talk and maybe try
to figure out what the truth is.

39
00:02:18,301 --> 00:02:20,420
And when you're an angel investor,
it's very similar. You're,

40
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,010
you're talking to founders and
sometimes they're tourists.

41
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,100
They're people who are just trying on
the concept of being a founder. They,

42
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:28,480
they saw the social network or they,

43
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:32,190
they seen how Uber or Google or
Airbnb have grown and they say,

44
00:02:32,191 --> 00:02:33,900
I want to be a jerk,
I'm going to be a founder.

45
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,450
And then they start pitching
investors and you realize, wow,

46
00:02:36,451 --> 00:02:37,650
this person's going to give up.

47
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:42,180
This idea does not have real meaning to
them and they have no idea how hard it

48
00:02:42,181 --> 00:02:43,080
is to be a founder.

49
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,680
So I think that journalism background
has helped a number of people,

50
00:02:46,681 --> 00:02:49,990
including Michael Moritz, who was
the original investor in Google, um,

51
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,820
was a journalist and wrote a book
actually about Apple, uh, back in the 80s.

52
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:54,683
And so it's,
uh,

53
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:59,890
it's one of the great paths I think to
investing is either being a founder today

54
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:04,390
you can be a founder and then go on to
be an investor or somebody in growth.

55
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:05,830
That's another big one.

56
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:09,720
Right now everybody's looking for
growth hackers to become investors. Um,

57
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,920
and then journalists,
it used to be Mbas,

58
00:03:11,921 --> 00:03:16,230
so you have to go get a Harvard Mba or
Stanford Mba and then you know, you,

59
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,570
your fraternity brothers would get
you into a venture firm. Now it's,

60
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,810
it's really delightful that the whole
model has flipped and it's like if you

61
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:24,250
don't have operational experience,

62
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:26,110
they really don't want you
to venture capital end.

63
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:31,300
It used to be all venture capitalists
had zero operating experience and they

64
00:03:31,301 --> 00:03:33,910
were all finance,
you know,

65
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:38,770
NBA Bros and all the firms were
just groups of, you know, Harvard,

66
00:03:38,771 --> 00:03:41,080
Stanford Mbas.
Now it's totally changed.

67
00:03:41,081 --> 00:03:44,590
They don't want to hire people without
operational experience cause the founders

68
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:45,880
can see through it immediately.
They're like,

69
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,520
you've never run a company and
I'm going to take your advice.

70
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:52,480
I'm going to take a pass on that.
And what do you think caused that or what,

71
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:55,210
what happened in the industry that,
that led to that shift and thinking?

72
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:00,580
I'm the founder friendly
movement. I think, um,

73
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:05,140
when a market gets hot and uh,
really Sean part,

74
00:04:05,141 --> 00:04:09,700
I would give Sean Parker a lot of credit
for it. You know, Sean Parker and Google,

75
00:04:09,701 --> 00:04:10,030
uh,

76
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:13,780
and Michael Borowitz had a little bit of
a back and forth over Plaxo back in the

77
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,350
day.

78
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:18,970
And he then brought Zuckerberg out
to silicon valley and famously,

79
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:19,600
you know,

80
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,410
left sequoia at the altar and wouldn't
let them invest because of how he felt he

81
00:04:23,411 --> 00:04:27,160
had been treated. And then founders
fund, Peter Teal created and,

82
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,410
and Sean Parker created founders fund.

83
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,370
And the reason they named it founders
fund was specifically to attack sequoia

84
00:04:33,371 --> 00:04:34,990
and other venture firms and say,

85
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,010
those firms are interested
in kicking out the founders.

86
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,670
These firms are interested in,
you know, being founder friendly.

87
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,750
And then that just changed everybody's
thinking like we have to be founder

88
00:04:46,751 --> 00:04:51,440
friendly, you know, uh, and you know,
there's pros and cons to it. Yeah.

89
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,271
How do you balance that,

90
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:57,070
the operational experience with a
maybe an idea driven founder? Yeah.

91
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,300
Um, it's pretty interesting when you
look at the history of Silicon Valley.

92
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:05,350
If you were to say I'm only going
to invest in founders who have great

93
00:05:05,351 --> 00:05:10,240
experience, you would miss Larry
and Sergei, you would've missed, um,

94
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,080
Bill Gates and you would have missed
Zuckerberg. You wouldn't have missed,

95
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,910
you know, Uber or some other
companies that had serial founders.

96
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:23,770
Twitter had a serial founder obviously
and Evan Williams. Um, so a lot,

97
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,020
there is actually a theory that the,

98
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:29,380
the biggest outcomes are by
people who are first timers.

99
00:05:29,381 --> 00:05:33,520
It's not actually backed up by
reality. It's kind of 50, 50. Um,

100
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,730
but the thing about venture
capital and angel investing,

101
00:05:36,731 --> 00:05:37,900
and she don't have to hit everything.

102
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,280
So if you miss Google and you get
Facebook or you get Facebook and you don't

103
00:05:42,281 --> 00:05:44,950
invest in Google or we get
airbnb and you don't get Uber,

104
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,640
well you have to do is hit one.
And then they let you write a book.

105
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:52,780
I hit six UNICORNS, you know, in
the first hundred investments.

106
00:05:52,781 --> 00:05:55,660
Now when I wrote the book
and did the book deal,

107
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:58,670
I had three UNICORNS and
since the book came out,

108
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:01,400
three of the other companies have
tipped over into that territory.

109
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,160
So it's a pretty good track record.
But you know I,

110
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,580
the reason I wrote the book
really is it's so opaque,

111
00:06:07,581 --> 00:06:10,340
the idea of being an angel investor
in doing it professionally,

112
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,340
but because of large the size,

113
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:18,140
the scale of Internet companies now and
the amount of wealth being created has

114
00:06:18,141 --> 00:06:22,190
gotten so great that now we went
from just maybe 10 or 15 years ago,

115
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:26,720
10 years ago when I started
angel investing, I started
about seven years ago,

116
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:29,390
but about 10 years ago when I
was a founder raising money,

117
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,050
there was only like a dozen or two dozen
angel investors of note and you could

118
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,610
kind of make the rounds very quickly.

119
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:39,611
Now I'd say in Silicon Valley there are
500 to a thousand people who do it as a

120
00:06:42,531 --> 00:06:44,330
primary activity.
In other words,

121
00:06:44,331 --> 00:06:46,730
he spent 50% of their time
on angel investing or more.

122
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:49,940
So I think there's going to be a
professional angel investing class.

123
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,080
The vcs have retreated and said,
we don't want to take risk anymore.

124
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,450
We don't want to do a
series a that's speculative.

125
00:06:56,451 --> 00:06:58,760
Bring US companies because
there's so many companies,

126
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,550
they've moved down treme and they just
bring us companies that have revenue and

127
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:02,270
traction.

128
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:06,830
If it's an enterprise company
with $100,000 or $50,000 a month,

129
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:07,933
we'll meet with them.

130
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:13,180
If it's a consumer product and it's got
10 to 50,000 people using it in a day

131
00:07:13,821 --> 00:07:16,610
and you've got three to six
months of traffic, we'll meet,

132
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,820
we'll probably wait till you hit 10
million users a month before we invest and

133
00:07:19,821 --> 00:07:20,654
do a series a.

134
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,400
But really that's opened up this huge
swath of what I call the Goldilocks Zone,

135
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:29,360
pre series a pre a venture
capitalist wanting to join the board,

136
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:33,860
but post the product being launched in
the market because let's all face it,

137
00:07:33,861 --> 00:07:37,010
we know that you can get any product
to market or I'd say nine out of 10

138
00:07:37,011 --> 00:07:37,844
products,

139
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:42,880
you can get some version of it to market
for either sweat equity or a $100,000

140
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:48,770
or less. Right? So if you wanted to
build slack or Twitter or even Uber,

141
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,590
you could do that for low hundreds of
thousands of dollars. In other words,

142
00:07:51,591 --> 00:07:53,570
people can bootstrap it,
friends and family,

143
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:57,320
some close friends to get that Beta out.

144
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:02,890
And that goldilocks zone is where I think
a lot of wealth creation is going to

145
00:08:03,321 --> 00:08:08,321
occur in the future because you've
removed the 99% of founders who never get

146
00:08:09,861 --> 00:08:13,820
their product to market from
your investment criteria.

147
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,240
And then you don't have the vcs in with
their sharp elbows blocking the angel

148
00:08:20,301 --> 00:08:22,820
investors yet.
And that's just probably a,

149
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,320
I'll call it a three year window in most
startups where angels can participate,

150
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,860
there's probably about four or five
rounds of funding in there as well. Uh,

151
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,030
anybody here,
um,

152
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:37,340
have a friend who's actively running a
startup and is raised money in the last

153
00:08:37,341 --> 00:08:41,900
12 months or so, right? So almost
half the room and if you talk to them,

154
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,470
they probably will raise five
rounds of funding before a series a,

155
00:08:45,471 --> 00:08:50,180
it used to be raised in angel round
friends and family and angel or seed round

156
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,780
and then a series a. Now you
raise friends, friends and family.

157
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,620
Then you do a pre seed round,
a seed round, an angel round,

158
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,530
a pre series a,
a series a extension.

159
00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:03,360
I mean they come up with all
these crazy names for them,

160
00:09:03,361 --> 00:09:07,980
but just call them $250,000 to
one point $5 million rounds.

161
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:12,870
And usually there's six convertible
notes converting when they finally get to

162
00:09:12,871 --> 00:09:13,704
series a,

163
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,800
which means you can really take her time
as an angel investor and get to know

164
00:09:16,801 --> 00:09:19,180
the company.
There is really no

165
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:23,700
need to panic and like I
have to get in this round,

166
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:27,180
you can actually wait and just build a
relationship with the founders over six

167
00:09:27,181 --> 00:09:27,451
months,

168
00:09:27,451 --> 00:09:30,990
which is kind of what I outlined in the
book is my theory on how to do it given

169
00:09:30,991 --> 00:09:32,590
today's environment,
uh,

170
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,740
which is there's a lot of startups and
they raise a lot of rounds of funding and

171
00:09:37,741 --> 00:09:41,310
you really don't want to be investing
in startups before they finish their

172
00:09:41,311 --> 00:09:42,860
product because it's a bit of a towel.

173
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:46,110
If you can't finish the product
without raising a ton of money,

174
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,220
maybe you're not an actual builder.
Sometimes it's true,

175
00:09:50,221 --> 00:09:54,060
but most of the time you're not an actual
builder. Yeah. It's 99 all over again.

176
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,450
I mean it is highly
tourist season right now.

177
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,020
So the opportunity is still very great,

178
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:05,940
but a lot of people are trying on and
playing the role of founder and what

179
00:10:05,941 --> 00:10:09,300
they'll find is it's a really,
really difficult job.

180
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:12,180
It's very hard to be the founder.
You don't sleep at night,

181
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:16,740
you've got somewhere between six
weeks and 12 months of runway.

182
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:22,070
Your product is probably under assault
from competitors and investors are

183
00:10:23,641 --> 00:10:28,230
waiting to see and people are deciding
between joining Facebook or Google and

184
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,190
getting huge RSUs are coming
to your company and you've
got to convince them and

185
00:10:32,191 --> 00:10:36,390
then they come for six months and leave.
So it's, it's very hard. And I think,

186
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,020
you know, that's, that's one of the, um,

187
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,880
the interesting parts of this is just
trying to figure out who's going to stick

188
00:10:44,881 --> 00:10:45,540
with the idea.

189
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:49,550
Because most days as a founder I would
say are not super rewarding there.

190
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,460
They're generally hard.

191
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,450
The reward you get for being a founder
of a technology company is you hire the

192
00:10:54,451 --> 00:10:57,540
smartest people you know,
and they all bring you the problems.

193
00:10:57,541 --> 00:11:01,890
They can't solve that, you know? So like
literally every week it's like, hey,

194
00:11:01,891 --> 00:11:05,250
we got all this stuff done, but here's
what we didn't get done. Can you help us?

195
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,390
Wow, that's challenging. You know,
that's, that's Elan's life is like, okay,

196
00:11:09,391 --> 00:11:12,210
I hired the smartest people
in the room and now they're,

197
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,750
they can't figure out these
things and I got to, you know,

198
00:11:15,751 --> 00:11:18,540
figure out how to get
the model three out on,

199
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,880
tie in and get the Falcon
to land properly. Right.

200
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:24,140
It's a hard life and it never gets easier.
So you mentioned sequoia.

201
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,740
Do you still work as a scout for,

202
00:11:25,741 --> 00:11:28,620
so I'm still part of this
request scouts program.

203
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:31,560
I do like a investment
once a year with them,

204
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:36,030
but I just finished up my first proper
fund. I had a $10 million Angel Fund,

205
00:11:36,031 --> 00:11:39,660
which was basically my friends,
uh, and my money. And then, um,

206
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:43,290
I'll do something in the future.
Uh,

207
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:47,750
you can't talk about those types
of things, right? Obviously. Um,

208
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,450
but one would suspect I'm going to stay
in the game and do another hundred 50

209
00:11:51,451 --> 00:11:54,640
investments. Uh, and then
I'll me at 300 investments.

210
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,010
It's very hard to scale angel investing.

211
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,920
That's one of the things
I'm trying to do right now.

212
00:11:59,921 --> 00:12:03,160
And part of the reason I wrote the book
was I think there's a lot of people who

213
00:12:03,161 --> 00:12:07,870
have money in very boring asset
classes. I call a dead money. You know,

214
00:12:07,871 --> 00:12:10,780
you've got your money in
bonds, real estate, you know,

215
00:12:10,781 --> 00:12:14,010
some equally balanced equities
portfolio using Wealthfront,

216
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,370
which is a great tool for doing that.

217
00:12:15,371 --> 00:12:20,230
I'm an investor in their company
and so you have these, uh, you know,

218
00:12:20,231 --> 00:12:24,220
swaths of money that are sitting there
and it's not kind of helping society in

219
00:12:24,221 --> 00:12:25,990
any way or changing things.

220
00:12:25,991 --> 00:12:30,040
I think people should take maybe 5% of
that net worth 10% of that net worth and

221
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,550
put it in something that's highly risky.
It may not return,

222
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,580
it may not have the stability of,
you know,

223
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:39,490
the stock market balanced portfolio that
people talk about that returns four to

224
00:12:39,491 --> 00:12:41,890
7% a year in doubles every eight years.

225
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,300
But you have that outside chance of going
in a hundred to one on an investment

226
00:12:46,301 --> 00:12:49,090
or a thousand to one which would
then double your net worth.

227
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:53,740
So I think people are overly risk averse
and I tried to outline in the book,

228
00:12:53,741 --> 00:12:56,380
here's a strategy,
maybe investing in syndicates,

229
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:59,470
people know Angel List or seed
invest or I have my own syndicate.

230
00:12:59,471 --> 00:13:00,460
Now Jason's syndicate,

231
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,910
people know that they can invest
alongside of angel investors.

232
00:13:03,911 --> 00:13:06,160
That's a great way to
learn how to do this.

233
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:10,960
You're investing $1,000 or $3,000 in
each startup and you do 20 startups.

234
00:13:10,961 --> 00:13:13,900
All of a sudden he's may
have invested $60,000 total,

235
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:18,310
but you've done 30 investments and you
are watching the monthly updates of 30

236
00:13:18,311 --> 00:13:18,731
companies.

237
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:22,240
It's a great way to build a network and
get in the game for what most people

238
00:13:22,241 --> 00:13:25,750
would consider the price of one
angel investment of 50 or $60,000.

239
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:30,940
So I try to outline all of that in the
book of how to slowly learn how to do

240
00:13:30,941 --> 00:13:34,840
this. And I think it's probably the
most exciting career you could have.

241
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:38,590
You get to hang out with the smartest
people who want to change the world and

242
00:13:38,591 --> 00:13:43,300
meet them when they have, you know, one
to 10 employees in their company. Right.

243
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,460
It's pretty exciting,
I have to say.

244
00:13:45,461 --> 00:13:47,440
And even if you lost
half your money doing it,

245
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,750
you'd be losing half of say five or 10%
of your net worth the network and the

246
00:13:52,751 --> 00:13:56,530
knowledge you would build during that
time would easily make up for that two and

247
00:13:56,531 --> 00:13:59,820
a half percent of your net worth.
Right, right. Regardless. And you're,

248
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,780
one of the things I liked most about
the book was the kind of attitude of

249
00:14:03,781 --> 00:14:05,850
democratizing angel investment.

250
00:14:05,851 --> 00:14:09,060
You mentioned earlier today that you
know there's a couple of hundred angel

251
00:14:09,061 --> 00:14:10,110
investors in the valley,

252
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,780
but this is saying that grandma
can be an angel investor,

253
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,610
college student can be an angel investor.

254
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:19,560
Talk us through some of the steps or
the advice that you would give people.

255
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:23,020
So I think it's purposely opaque.
We,

256
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,280
we have a very unfair system in the
United States where there's two classes of

257
00:14:26,281 --> 00:14:27,114
people,

258
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:32,160
accredited investors and nonaccredited
people who make over $200,000 a year for

259
00:14:32,161 --> 00:14:34,110
a couple of years in a row
are considered accredited.

260
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,120
If they have a million
or $2 million in cash,

261
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:37,680
you can look it up on the SCCs website.

262
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:41,100
And then the other 95% of America
are considered nonaccredited.

263
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:45,690
But those 95% can go to Vegas and bet on
a sports team or they can play in their

264
00:14:45,691 --> 00:14:48,600
local poker game or they can buy,
you know,

265
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:53,180
they can do whatever they want with
their money. Um, using bad judgment,

266
00:14:53,181 --> 00:14:54,200
good judgment,
et cetera.

267
00:14:54,201 --> 00:14:58,400
They could even buy stocks in the public
market without having to check with

268
00:14:58,401 --> 00:15:01,640
anybody. But the idea of
investing in private companies,

269
00:15:01,641 --> 00:15:06,260
which is where ultra wealth is created
really outsized outcomes, is very,

270
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:11,650
there's nowhere you can have these kinds
of odds to get these kinds of returns

271
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:16,320
except in Silicon Valley and startups.
So I think that we'll see that change.

272
00:15:16,321 --> 00:15:17,270
It's in Europe,

273
00:15:17,271 --> 00:15:20,840
which is interesting because it's a
pretty protectionist kind of a vibe over

274
00:15:20,841 --> 00:15:25,100
there. Obviously they allow everybody
to invest their money however they want.

275
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:28,300
So here in the United States we have a
little bit of a history of, you know,

276
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,950
not trusting people with their own money,
but that's unraveling.

277
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:31,820
It's good intention.

278
00:15:31,821 --> 00:15:35,260
But now they have something called
equity crowdfunding where sites like seed

279
00:15:35,261 --> 00:15:39,680
Invest in republic are taking companies
and allowing them to raise money from

280
00:15:39,681 --> 00:15:44,420
civilians, nonaccredited investors
for $500. So I look at it and say,

281
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:47,690
you know what? I see people
out there spending money on
all kinds of dopey stuff.

282
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,990
I think making investments in
startups would be a lot better.

283
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:55,430
And if you were to ask all of the
Etsy sellers early Etsy sellers,

284
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,880
hey, you're, you're not
accredited, but we have, you know,

285
00:15:58,881 --> 00:16:00,470
5,000 creators on the platform,

286
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,290
you can each invest up to a
thousand dollars in the platform.

287
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,350
How many of them would have done it?
And what kind of wealth would be created?

288
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:10,490
Ebay, same story. Think about all the
adsense partners in the early days.

289
00:16:10,491 --> 00:16:13,310
If you had told me when we were in
in gadget, is adsense going to work?

290
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:16,160
I was like, well, we're making
$3,000 a day off of it. You know,

291
00:16:16,161 --> 00:16:19,580
10 years ago I would have
made that baton but pre uh,

292
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:24,440
public Google shares for sure, but that
opportunity wasn't open TV than me.

293
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,460
I wasn't accredited yet.

294
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:28,670
At that time I was negative 10
grand actually and my bank account.

295
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:33,440
So I was stuck. So I'm hoping that
all changes over time. And since we,

296
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,600
since I wrote the book,
it's been 25 days,

297
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:41,170
we had 1200 people in our Angel
Syndicate and we've had 700 more join.

298
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:45,380
So we're averaging something like 30
people a day applying and then accepting

299
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:48,710
maybe half of them. And so I think
this is going to change in a big way.

300
00:16:48,711 --> 00:16:53,360
A company Cafe X, which I'm an investor
in, which is a robotic coffee machine, um,

301
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,300
who has raised to um,

302
00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:00,180
not equity crowdfunding but to
syndicates of node, like, you know,

303
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:04,040
upwards of $1 million from investors,
10 K at a time.

304
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:09,460
Now we have hundreds of investors on
that cap table under one umbrella.

305
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:14,180
My syndicate and all of those people get
to participate. I'm super proud of that.

306
00:17:14,181 --> 00:17:18,200
If I becomes a Unicorn and those people
turn 10,000 and he goes a hundred x,

307
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:22,760
I mean I would be super excited to see
people become millionaires or to generate

308
00:17:22,761 --> 00:17:26,060
that kind of wealth. And I've seen
it happen. I mean, in Silicon Valley,

309
00:17:26,061 --> 00:17:27,500
I see people who are pretty dopey,

310
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,280
make angel investments and make
millions of dollars pretty regularly,

311
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:36,260
and it should be open to more people.
And most people have a good eye for this.

312
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:40,550
If you were to ask anybody who was on
Linkedin in the first two years who were

313
00:17:40,551 --> 00:17:42,770
recruiters or HR executives,

314
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:46,820
those HR executives and recruiters who
would normally not have access had the

315
00:17:46,821 --> 00:17:47,720
insight information.

316
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:51,780
They knew that linkedin was going to
become a very significant platform.

317
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:55,890
The early creators on Youtube knew that
it was going to be something special.

318
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:59,250
It was obvious to them,
but they could not participate into it.

319
00:17:59,251 --> 00:18:03,060
And Chad would have absolutely allowed
youtube creators to invest if that was

320
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:06,270
allowed. And that's what we're
slowly starting to have happen.

321
00:18:06,271 --> 00:18:08,790
It started last June and it's been a year.

322
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,990
The companies that are doing equity
crowdfunding, I would say, um,

323
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,530
are the Wa in some cases the ones
that didn't clear market with venture

324
00:18:16,531 --> 00:18:17,670
capitalists and angels.

325
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,660
But I think that's slowly
starting to change where people,

326
00:18:21,661 --> 00:18:25,470
the scariness of doing something new
like angel is syndicates was very new and

327
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,570
people were very scared of it.
That's flipped over.

328
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:32,490
So if everybody were to invest 5%
of their net worth and startups,

329
00:18:32,491 --> 00:18:34,260
I think the world will
get better a lot quicker.

330
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,710
We create a lot more jobs and we say
a lot more problems getting solved.

331
00:18:37,711 --> 00:18:41,310
So I actually believe that this is
something bigger than just making money.

332
00:18:41,311 --> 00:18:42,690
I think it's making change in the world.

333
00:18:42,691 --> 00:18:45,000
If you think about all the
great change that's occurred,

334
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:49,980
it's because some angel
investors supported some
crazy kids who had some crazy

335
00:18:49,981 --> 00:18:53,890
idea, whether it was Larry
and Sergei or chat and uh,

336
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:57,210
the team at Youtube or
snapchat and you know, they,

337
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,870
they all needed some small
amount of money to get going.

338
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:05,760
And these experiments are worth trying
and if you lose, you know, six, seven,

339
00:19:05,761 --> 00:19:09,480
eight or nine out of 10 bats in the
last bad returns, more than 10 x,

340
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,250
you're in the black.
Uh,

341
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,280
and just as a gambler myself
as a semi professional gambler,

342
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:19,990
in fact like high stakes gambler in poker,
like it's,

343
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:25,610
it's very hard for people to deal with
losing six or seven hands in a row.

344
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,780
Anybody here play poker?

345
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:32,550
Anybody here ever loose seven or eight
hands in a row when they were the odds?

346
00:19:32,551 --> 00:19:34,610
Favor? Yeah. People are
raising their hand. I mean,

347
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,650
it's going to happen one out of
every 500 games you play, right?

348
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,860
Like when you're not ready for it,
you stare at the ceiling and go,

349
00:19:40,861 --> 00:19:43,380
how did I lose all of those heads?

350
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:47,460
I lost six hands in a row that I should
have won. It's a very odd feeling. Uh,

351
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:50,940
that's actually how the normal for angel
investing if you're doing it right.

352
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:55,830
Like when I introduced people
to Uber 17 of 22 or 23,

353
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,620
oh,
only three people said yes.

354
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,490
Out of maybe 20 or 25 people I introduced
them to and we're talking about the

355
00:20:02,491 --> 00:20:06,330
greatest investors in the world said no
to Uber and they said no two or three

356
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:09,930
times. Um, and I'm the
three people who said yes,

357
00:20:09,931 --> 00:20:13,830
all have nine figure positions.
Uh, and the people who said no,

358
00:20:13,831 --> 00:20:16,980
or some of them have 10 figure position,
some of the people said no.

359
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,170
Just every time they see me,
the way I should have listened.

360
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,890
And the list of reasons of why a
startup will fail is very long.

361
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:26,250
And the list of reasons of wildly
succeeded, they're very short.

362
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:30,200
And so what I've learned to do is
work against my natural, you know,

363
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:34,290
our biological nature is to be
conservative as humans, right?

364
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:36,480
If you were to swim across the river,

365
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:39,030
the river might take you or
the alligator might take you.

366
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:40,830
Or if you go over the hill,
the line might eat you.

367
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:44,970
We are conservative
animals for good reason,

368
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:48,190
but we don't need to be conservative
in this aspect of her life.

369
00:20:48,191 --> 00:20:49,160
We should be risk taking,

370
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:53,200
but risk taking is something that
people just don't have in their DNA.

371
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,780
Did you have to unlearn what
your DNA is telling you.

372
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:59,080
You should be taking this risk. There
is no crocodile that's going to eat you.

373
00:20:59,081 --> 00:21:02,500
If you lose your 10 k here's gonna
lose 10 K and make it back next month.

374
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:03,610
So don't worry about it.

375
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:08,500
It's fine to burn that 10
K it's a worthwhile risk
and people overestimate the

376
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:12,550
downsides so much. It's crazy. Let's,
let's unpack that a bit. So when,

377
00:21:12,551 --> 00:21:14,020
when you're looking at an opportunity,

378
00:21:14,021 --> 00:21:16,930
what characteristics or
qualities do you look for?

379
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,930
And the question behind the question,

380
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:25,270
what makes you push past
that? Sure. Fear. Yeah.

381
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:26,223
Um,

382
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,910
so I usually do make that long list of
reasons just to get it out of my system

383
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,040
and then I just take it on our,
cross it out or rip it up.

384
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,750
Cause I assume that a smart founder,

385
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:38,710
we'll get through those and you have to
ask yourself not what could go wrong,

386
00:21:38,711 --> 00:21:39,610
but what could go right,

387
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,890
what could go right for the company
and if those things are even a one in a

388
00:21:44,891 --> 00:21:49,060
hundred chance or a one in
50 chance of it going right.

389
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:51,850
If the odds pay off higher than that,
it's worth doing.

390
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,990
And so that's Kinda how I look at the
entire world right now. And I've had to,

391
00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:00,840
I've changed my whole thinking. I
tend to bet on people. Um, and I,

392
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:05,410
I'm good at reading people and I think
the biggest mistakes I've made in

393
00:22:05,411 --> 00:22:09,010
investing, which were
Tesla, Twitter and Zynga,

394
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,200
I wasn't an angel investor at the time,

395
00:22:11,201 --> 00:22:14,920
but my friends were starting
those companies and I
could have invested in each

396
00:22:14,921 --> 00:22:18,460
of them and that would have been a $50
million return on average each based on

397
00:22:18,461 --> 00:22:20,560
the check size.
I was writing shortly after that.

398
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,470
And in every case with Twitter was,

399
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:28,980
I just thought Twitter was such
a terrible idea because if it's,

400
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:33,160
I sat there with Evan and Biz and I said
to them like, they were like, hey look,

401
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:37,810
just take her blackberry out and we'll
text four oh four oh four and you say

402
00:22:37,811 --> 00:22:40,120
what you're having for breakfast and
business is going to say what he's having

403
00:22:40,121 --> 00:22:41,740
for breakfast and fcs,
what they're having for business.

404
00:22:41,741 --> 00:22:44,470
And all of our phones go off in the s
it was an SMS service at the beginning.

405
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:47,380
Yeah, there were no apps
and I was like, Oh my God,

406
00:22:47,381 --> 00:22:51,210
Evan is Evan Williams. I
was like, this is so stupid.

407
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:54,250
Nobody cares what business having for
breakfast or what we're having for

408
00:22:54,251 --> 00:22:57,640
breakfast and you just
cost me like 4 cents.

409
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:02,560
I'm going to run through my whole SMS
plan and there's no blog post here.

410
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,630
You create a blogger. He
sold it to Google, right?

411
00:23:04,631 --> 00:23:06,220
Like people wrote their thoughts.

412
00:23:06,221 --> 00:23:10,000
It was full thoughts and now you're saying
just it's the same as blogger except

413
00:23:10,001 --> 00:23:13,240
without the blog post. It's just the
title and now he's back to medium. Right.

414
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,520
Well, and that was like, you
realize that if this succeeds,

415
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:17,140
it's going to be a cacophony of idiots.

416
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,090
Like literally everybody who
can't put together a blog post,

417
00:23:22,091 --> 00:23:23,620
which is only 400 words,

418
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:28,450
they're going to write 140 characters
instead of 140 or 300 words.

419
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,840
Every idiot in the world is going to
be on this thing all day saying stupid

420
00:23:31,841 --> 00:23:35,110
things and it's going to
be getting magnified like
grace. I was absolutely right

421
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,580
and it costs me $50 million. So
then I realized, you know what?

422
00:23:39,581 --> 00:23:41,260
I don't have to know this is if there,

423
00:23:41,261 --> 00:23:43,570
if there is Jason's law
of Angel Investing, it's,

424
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,770
I don't need to know if your
idea is going to succeed.

425
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,420
I just need to know if
you're going to succeed.

426
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,270
So since I started that
approach to angel investing,

427
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:54,050
which is does this person have passion?
Do they have skill?

428
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:56,810
Do they understand how to
build a product and a team?

429
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:01,100
I look for those traits and when you
ask people questions, short questions,

430
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:03,590
what are you working on?
Why will this idea work?

431
00:24:03,591 --> 00:24:06,830
Now has something changed in the
world that makes this idea work now?

432
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:11,660
Or tell me about the product
design or why are you doing this?

433
00:24:11,661 --> 00:24:14,360
Just like literally pointing out one
feature of the product. Say, wow,

434
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:17,540
what is this syndication thing,
this little snippet here on Youtube.

435
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:20,510
Why is that important? Like,
if you were to ask, you know,

436
00:24:20,511 --> 00:24:22,850
Chad earlier that it was like,
oh,

437
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,120
because people want to put videos on
their site, there's no easy way to do it.

438
00:24:26,121 --> 00:24:27,950
They have to put up a server.
So if they would,

439
00:24:27,951 --> 00:24:30,830
if they put this javascript
into their blogger.com account,

440
00:24:30,831 --> 00:24:33,680
they can put a video on their site.
Oh, why is that important? Well,

441
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:37,100
because it's free marketing for us.
We're giving them free hosting a videos.

442
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:39,560
They give us free marketing to their
audience and we're going to grow the

443
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:43,370
service that way. That was the why
now, syndication and cloud computing.

444
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:47,130
So I'm now, I now have
three or four founders, um,

445
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:51,110
who ha are creating products,
um,

446
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:53,330
that I invested in after
investing in their last company.

447
00:24:53,331 --> 00:24:56,840
So Raul created a company called
reportive that people may have used.

448
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,890
That was that little sidebar in Gmail
that told you everybody's social stats and

449
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,770
this is their Twitter handle and
here's a bunch of information on them.

450
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:06,770
He sold that to linkedin. Now he's
doing something called superhuman,

451
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:10,490
which is like a better Gmail. I
mean like, well anyway, I mean,

452
00:25:10,491 --> 00:25:12,530
I don't make anybody feel,
feel bad in the room.

453
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:15,890
It's kind of like nobody's
taken on Jean Allen a long time,

454
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:19,940
rather it feels like gmls like it was so
radical when it came out 15 years ago.

455
00:25:19,941 --> 00:25:23,270
So he's kind of taking an approach of uh,
uh,

456
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:27,020
the same approach that GML took towards
the, of like a radical email client.

457
00:25:27,021 --> 00:25:31,310
And so when he sold reportive, I made two
or three times my money and I told him,

458
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,120
hey, this is fine. Like I, I'd rather
we don't sell, but okay, uh, you're,

459
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:39,230
you got four cofounders. I only ask one
thing role, when you have your next idea,

460
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:43,860
you call me and I can be the
first investor. He called
me, I put $1 million in,

461
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:46,190
I joined the board, boom,
we're off to the races.

462
00:25:46,191 --> 00:25:49,150
And this has happened like three times
now where somebody who I invested in who

463
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:53,240
got a single or double or lost my
money, we come back, we do it again.

464
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:58,240
So I'm investing in the arc of a founder's
career and I think that's the way

465
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,550
that's in my mind, the best way to do it
as if you know somebody who's a winner.

466
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,410
If you know they work hard,
you know they're passionate,

467
00:26:03,411 --> 00:26:04,610
you know they're not going to give up.

468
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,180
These are the qualities of the
founders who when they won't give up,

469
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:11,000
they have skills and they
have passion for the space.

470
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:16,030
If an intelligent person wakes up one
day and realize is how hard it's going to

471
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:20,930
be and how much sacrifice there is and
they're not passionate about with the

472
00:26:20,931 --> 00:26:24,500
idea, the rational thing
to do is to quit and say,

473
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:27,140
this is going to be too hard.
You have to really,

474
00:26:27,141 --> 00:26:31,160
really care to blow up two or three
rockets and still go to work the next day.

475
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,840
You know,
Ilan was,

476
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:37,130
he's a close personal friend of mine
and like when he blew up the second or

477
00:26:37,131 --> 00:26:40,760
third rocket, I mean it was,
you know, I think that was,

478
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:45,420
that pushed him to the brink. I
mean he was really, really focused,

479
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:47,900
but he wasn't going to
give up and he was it.

480
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,340
It strengthened his resolve if anything.

481
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:53,400
And now you watch these idiots
on Twitter, Baxter, Twitter,

482
00:26:53,401 --> 00:26:58,401
cacophony of idiots like criticizing the
model three for it being Mike a couple

483
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:01,820
of weeks late or something.
And Kenny hit the numbers.

484
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:04,560
I mean like I was just driving the
car for a couple of days last week.

485
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,650
It's got 300 mile range.
It's drives like a Porsche.

486
00:27:07,651 --> 00:27:11,580
Like these idiots are still doubting him.
It's like,

487
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,050
did you not,

488
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:18,050
have you not been paying attention like
these guys that it's like literally the,

489
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:23,130
there were always these haters out there
and doubters who throw rocks at these

490
00:27:23,131 --> 00:27:25,140
companies who are trying
to change the world.

491
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:29,790
And literally if Elon
succeeds like no more smog,

492
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:34,410
you know, energy independence
from dictators who own
big swats of fossil fuels,

493
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:38,910
global warming,
like a free transportation,

494
00:27:38,911 --> 00:27:42,000
eventually no more road deaths
because of self driving.

495
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,270
Like there's this whole swath of
incredible things that will happen.

496
00:27:45,271 --> 00:27:50,271
So it's so amazing to me how people could
not be positive about what's happening

497
00:27:51,121 --> 00:27:54,200
in the world. We're trending,
everything is trending so much in,

498
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:58,020
in the right direction and there are small
issues here on the sides that we have

499
00:27:58,021 --> 00:28:02,310
to solve. Some of them are big, but
I look at them all as incredibly, um,

500
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:07,350
solvable. Incredibly. It's
solvable, including jobs, including,

501
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,070
you know, environmental issues.
I think we can solve all of them,

502
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,110
which is a lack of,
um,

503
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:18,600
positivity and a lack of paying
attention to what's happened to date.

504
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:23,190
We seem to solve a lot of the problems
that we face as humanity. If we are,

505
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:28,290
you know, India fatiguable and clever
in our approach and we're clever.

506
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,970
We're clever species.
Well,

507
00:28:29,971 --> 00:28:33,120
let's talk about the people building
that better world because the book is

508
00:28:33,121 --> 00:28:36,210
written kind of in the guise
of how to become an investor,

509
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:39,870
but it would also be really useful to
people who want to build a company that

510
00:28:39,871 --> 00:28:44,570
others would invest. It is really about
talk about that. Yeah. Well, as a founder,

511
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:48,360
you know, everybody's trying to figure
out how to hack investors. Like, I mean,

512
00:28:48,361 --> 00:28:52,350
the whole point of y Combinator for the
last couple of years has been how to

513
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:57,300
manipulate and get an edge
on the investors. And I think
it's the wrong approach.

514
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:00,960
Um, I think they've realized it's the
wrong approach because you're really in it

515
00:29:00,961 --> 00:29:03,780
together. You don't want to
try to trick the investors.

516
00:29:03,781 --> 00:29:07,050
So people are constantly asking me,
how do you get an investor to invest?

517
00:29:07,051 --> 00:29:08,670
You know? And it's like, well,

518
00:29:08,671 --> 00:29:11,760
if you have a great team and
a great company and great
product and customers who

519
00:29:11,761 --> 00:29:16,020
love you and some level of traction,
you're going to meet a hundred investors,

520
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:16,711
you know,

521
00:29:16,711 --> 00:29:20,700
and eventually six or seven of them
will invest and then it's that simple.

522
00:29:20,701 --> 00:29:24,150
But they're trying to figure out how
to hack the investment and instead of

523
00:29:24,151 --> 00:29:25,170
trying to hack the investment,

524
00:29:25,171 --> 00:29:29,490
how about hacking the usage and the
engagement level of your customers?

525
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:32,550
So if you had a hundred units of work,

526
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,990
this idea of spending 90 units on
hacking me, investing investor community,

527
00:29:36,991 --> 00:29:40,920
which is a pretty sophisticated group
of people to try and hack. Like,

528
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:44,830
why not spend those 90 cycles trying to
triple the engagement of your current

529
00:29:44,831 --> 00:29:49,420
customer base and then explain with
the last 10 units of energy here,

530
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:52,510
here's what we did to increase
engagement and tell that story.

531
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:57,780
So I think this is the rookie mistake a
is just too much gaming of the investor

532
00:29:58,961 --> 00:30:01,700
community and trying to figure
out how to hack it and what,

533
00:30:01,701 --> 00:30:04,270
what are they thinking?
It's pretty simple what they're thinking.

534
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:09,990
Does this person have the ability to
build a team that can build a product that

535
00:30:10,721 --> 00:30:14,110
delights users and if they can get
that product to market, you've,

536
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:15,370
you've built that credibility.

537
00:30:15,371 --> 00:30:20,290
So and to think it's going to happen
after one meeting is probably silly.

538
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,430
Like it usually happens over five,
six, seven meetings and email updates.

539
00:30:24,431 --> 00:30:29,431
So I'm so a pro this monthly update
that I require it from my investments

540
00:30:30,131 --> 00:30:32,590
because the first hundred
investments I did,

541
00:30:32,591 --> 00:30:34,390
I didn't require them
to send monthly updates.

542
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:38,260
Now in my legal documents that require
a monthly update that starts with the

543
00:30:38,261 --> 00:30:40,930
most important metrics,
how many months of runway to have,

544
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:44,050
how much cash is left in the bank.
When do we need to raise money next?

545
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:46,840
What's the revenue?
What's the user engagement?

546
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,790
And so I've been making
this a requirement, uh,

547
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:54,670
because so many founders don't send these
updates and then they don't have the

548
00:30:54,671 --> 00:30:57,580
opportunity to raise money from the
investors who they've already convinced to

549
00:30:57,581 --> 00:30:59,500
put money in because those
investors lose faith.

550
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,430
What I tell founders now is if
you want me to invest, you know,

551
00:31:03,431 --> 00:31:06,190
so many deals coming at me right now.
Um,

552
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:08,500
put me on your monthly
update for three months.

553
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:11,080
I'll read your monthly updates
for three months before I invest.

554
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:14,140
And then I'll decide like looking at your
monthly update when it's right for me

555
00:31:14,141 --> 00:31:16,540
to invest when it's in my goldilocks zone.

556
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:20,920
And so the best thing that founders
can do is really understand what that

557
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:24,780
investors invested in and what,
what their timing typically is.

558
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:29,200
There are investors who like to invest
when the company's worth $1 million or $2

559
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,290
million before it launches their product
because they're product driven people

560
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:33,041
and they make products.

561
00:31:33,041 --> 00:31:36,820
So they want to be involved in the
product creation and they want to be there

562
00:31:36,821 --> 00:31:40,090
for the day. It launches, there's other
people who want to be there, you know,

563
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:43,660
right after it launches like myself,
like I want to just see six weeks of data.

564
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:48,160
There are other people who want to see two
years of data, you know, vcs typically,

565
00:31:48,161 --> 00:31:50,950
and you just have to know your audience.
Um,

566
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:56,010
and so I get monthly updates
more consistently in some
cases from companies I

567
00:31:57,161 --> 00:31:59,950
passed on investing in than
the ones I did invest in.

568
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:04,090
Like literally I have somebody who was
sending me legal documents to sign for an

569
00:32:04,091 --> 00:32:07,870
approval of a Silicon Valley Bank
loan and credit facility. You know,

570
00:32:07,871 --> 00:32:10,450
when you're an investor you have to
sign off on these future investments.

571
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:12,400
And I'm like, I haven't heard
from you in like 18 months,

572
00:32:12,401 --> 00:32:15,070
what's going on with the company? It's
like explaining everything that occurred.

573
00:32:15,071 --> 00:32:17,590
I'm like,
you could've just done this monthly like,

574
00:32:17,591 --> 00:32:21,010
or whatever and it would
catch up. Yes. It's weird. Um,

575
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:24,880
so I think the monthly update is,

576
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:29,800
puts people on this cadence where they
can build trust and build credibility

577
00:32:29,801 --> 00:32:30,461
with investors.

578
00:32:30,461 --> 00:32:32,350
And that's what you're really trying
to do with those investors is just just

579
00:32:32,351 --> 00:32:36,430
trying to build this sense that you're
credible and you're not stomping.

580
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:39,950
Like when people get the sense that like
you're not going to give up and that

581
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,310
this train is leaving the station
and they can either get on it or not.

582
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,590
That makes it a very
attractive investments.

583
00:32:45,591 --> 00:32:49,700
Like this person's not going to give up.
And that's a,

584
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,590
at least you know that your money didn't
get burned without people even trying.

585
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,610
Right.
Um,

586
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:58,730
it's nice to know that people try it and
I don't mind people losing the money.

587
00:32:58,731 --> 00:33:02,780
I mean, as long as they tried
hard, that's really the goal. Okay.

588
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,250
Um, you've lived in New York,
you've got many, many years.

589
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:10,780
You've lived in southern
California, 30 and 10. Yeah. And uh,

590
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:15,710
now San Francisco for three. Yeah. How
do the business communities differ?

591
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,170
How does being an investor in
those communities differ? Sure. Um,

592
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:23,210
you can build a great company in
those three cities. No problem.

593
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:26,120
I'm a great founder. We'll build a
great business in those three cities.

594
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:29,150
If you're in southern California,
over here in New York,

595
00:33:29,151 --> 00:33:31,940
you're going to have less
competition as a founder for talent.

596
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:36,950
Talent will stay longer, costs will be a
third less. Those are all great things.

597
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:39,920
You're going to have to come to the
valley to meet with investors and those

598
00:33:39,921 --> 00:33:43,730
investors will not mind going to New York
or Los Angeles because they're awesome

599
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:45,470
cities.
And if you were to rank the three cities,

600
00:33:45,471 --> 00:33:47,750
it's like New York's the
greatest city in the world.

601
00:33:47,751 --> 00:33:50,780
Los Angeles is probably
the better lifestyle. Um,

602
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:54,290
and very similar to New York as people
who have lived in both cities will say

603
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:57,620
I'm in San Francisco is the worst run,
great city in America.

604
00:33:57,621 --> 00:34:01,570
It's like just horribly run. It's
a completely dysfunctional, um,

605
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:05,930
and like can't even solve like
minor issues. So, um, it's pretty,

606
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:09,290
pretty tragic in a way.
But if you're a founder there,

607
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,680
obviously you have access
to more a wider talent pool.

608
00:34:12,681 --> 00:34:16,430
I wouldn't say necessarily better. Uh,
but the costs are ridiculous now. I mean,

609
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:19,590
it's really like show
stopping lead bad. Um, so the,

610
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:23,720
the high art I think right now is to put
your headquarters in Silicon Valley in

611
00:34:23,721 --> 00:34:28,130
a we work office and then have everybody
in Arizona or Los Angeles or San Diego

612
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:32,060
or have your team at Waterloo doing your
code and have a mail drop in the valley.

613
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:35,750
Basically it's like having this little
like headquarters and the valley until

614
00:34:35,751 --> 00:34:40,370
you can get some, you know, a valley
vcs VC to put a series a and, um,

615
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:46,070
your chances as an angel investor in
hitting a Unicorn are greatly reduced

616
00:34:46,071 --> 00:34:49,310
outside of Silicon Valley. Just
statistically, everybody knows that.

617
00:34:49,311 --> 00:34:51,140
And if you look at the
hundred billion dollar out,

618
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:53,780
the 50 billion or $100 billion outcomes,

619
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:57,080
those are almost universally
come from silicon valley.

620
00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:01,160
You do have Amazon and Microsoft
as the two notable exceptions,

621
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:04,930
and you have snapchat down here, but
snapchat might be a $5 billion company,

622
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:09,380
not a $10 billion plus company.
So what I say in the book is like,

623
00:35:09,381 --> 00:35:12,170
do to be a great investor.
Do you need to be in Silicon Valley?

624
00:35:12,171 --> 00:35:14,900
It's the answer's yes.
Now you could go there.

625
00:35:14,901 --> 00:35:18,560
So I lived here and was
going up there weekly. Um,

626
00:35:18,561 --> 00:35:21,050
and that was a lot of work. Um, but that,

627
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:25,640
that's how I did investing and I hit
a four of the six unicorns doing that.

628
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:30,260
So it just going up there and going
up for two days, three days a month,

629
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:34,130
you have a chance to just book all your
meetings and, and get it done that way.

630
00:35:34,131 --> 00:35:37,740
So there's something very special
about the, the community up there,

631
00:35:37,741 --> 00:35:39,960
but you see something very nice
happening down here as well.

632
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,550
And I think the question is,

633
00:35:41,551 --> 00:35:46,410
will those people who make money off
of snapchat or working for dollar shave

634
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:48,000
club,
will they become angels are not,

635
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:50,340
and will they start investing
in this community or not?

636
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,420
And that's what happened
in New York. You know, the,

637
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:55,110
the silicon alley reporter days,
there weren't that many investors.

638
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:59,070
Things started to work out and you had
someone like Kevin Ryan from DoubleClick

639
00:35:59,071 --> 00:36:02,900
who had made a ton of money,
launched business insider, um,

640
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:07,700
and uh, a DNS company
work. I'd CDN company,

641
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,930
can't remember the name of it.
That did very well.

642
00:36:09,931 --> 00:36:13,910
And he also did a flashlights out, so he
was just investing in everything there.

643
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:17,760
Um, and, and you're starting to see
that cycle. I think actually lear hippo,

644
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:21,180
Erica Poe was at Ziff Davis in New York
and then they did lear hippo and they

645
00:36:21,181 --> 00:36:24,300
started a venture firm that invested
in buzzfeed and Huffington post and all

646
00:36:24,301 --> 00:36:26,550
that kind of stuff.
So you see that renewal happening,

647
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:30,870
new firms and new individuals
in those cities. So, uh,

648
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:34,580
Stockholm is another crazy example
of nine unicorns out of Stockholm.

649
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:38,670
That's crazy. How'd that happen? But
I've been asking for an explanation.

650
00:36:38,671 --> 00:36:42,450
Nobody can give it to me except that they
worked really hard over there because

651
00:36:42,451 --> 00:36:44,610
there's no sunlight long.
Lynchers lat long winters,

652
00:36:44,611 --> 00:36:46,730
they just like worked for 12 hours a day.
But you know,

653
00:36:46,731 --> 00:36:50,110
there were nine that came out of there,
which is pretty, pretty amazing. Um,

654
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,650
so innovation can come out of any place.

655
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,600
How are things going here after the memo?

656
00:36:54,601 --> 00:36:58,230
I'm curious a lot of talk about that
or no, wait was like, I was like,

657
00:36:58,231 --> 00:37:01,290
what should we talk about? They're
like Google memo, Uber and benchmark.

658
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:04,680
They like it was all the
controversial topics. Well, to a,

659
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:08,670
to side step that question entirely. Go
ahead. Let's talk a little bit about it,

660
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:11,750
about growth and optimism
growth and on what,

661
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:15,660
what areas do you see
a nascent opportunity?

662
00:37:15,661 --> 00:37:18,510
And we've talked a little bit about free
energy. We've talked about robotics.

663
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:21,330
Yeah. Uh, well, you know,

664
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,610
in our industry we
always have false starts.

665
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:27,080
And so if you think about
Vr as an example, uh,

666
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:30,930
how many people will remember VRML
the virtual reality markup language?

667
00:37:30,931 --> 00:37:31,940
Like there was like,
literally we,

668
00:37:31,941 --> 00:37:35,340
we're going to go through the Jaco index
and be like flying through in three d

669
00:37:35,341 --> 00:37:38,940
and like picking arts and leisure
or photography nudes, you know,

670
00:37:38,941 --> 00:37:42,540
whenever I'm like pulling out the folders
and it was going to be this incredible

671
00:37:42,541 --> 00:37:45,910
Gerald linear world and,
um, it never happened.

672
00:37:45,911 --> 00:37:49,200
And now send you put an Oculus on and
you're like, wow, that's incredible.

673
00:37:49,201 --> 00:37:53,880
But still hasn't happened, right? Like
when is that going to happen? Exactly. Um,

674
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,910
VR VR might be a false start right now.

675
00:37:56,950 --> 00:38:00,690
The headsets seem extremely expensive
and it might still be four or five years

676
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,810
away. Before we have 100
million people using it, right?

677
00:38:03,811 --> 00:38:07,740
And you really need to have
tens of millions of people
to possess the technology

678
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,900
in order to have 10
million use it in a day.

679
00:38:09,901 --> 00:38:13,130
And that's when you sort of hit this
tipping point. Now ar feels a lot closer,

680
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,000
right?
So that,

681
00:38:14,001 --> 00:38:16,170
that's something where it feels like
you could have 10 million people a day

682
00:38:16,171 --> 00:38:18,600
using it, you know, two years from now.

683
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:23,580
And so I do think there's something there
with ar and Vr, whether it's two, three,

684
00:38:23,581 --> 00:38:26,700
four years. So that would make it
a good time to start investing.

685
00:38:26,701 --> 00:38:29,010
But people who invested two
years ago and VR companies,

686
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,720
those companies are running
out of money right now.

687
00:38:30,721 --> 00:38:34,740
And they're desperate because they
thought they would be selling $5 million

688
00:38:34,741 --> 00:38:39,450
worth of software apps and they're
selling 50,000 a year. And it's, you know,

689
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,140
like really early adopters.

690
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,730
Ai was when we had a lot of false starts
on and now it's not a false start.

691
00:38:45,731 --> 00:38:50,170
So I've been pitched on six or seven
companies that are taking AI into Schuman,

692
00:38:50,171 --> 00:38:54,040
resources, customer support, legal, um,

693
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:58,360
and it's pretty obvious
that like, I dunno, 60, 70,

694
00:38:58,361 --> 00:39:01,960
80% of legal docs that have been created,
you should just be able to be like,

695
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:06,100
okay Google, I need a nondisclosure with
Jason that says this, this and this.

696
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:09,280
And then it's just like, okay, we sent
it over to him and then I get an okay,

697
00:39:09,281 --> 00:39:13,660
I sign it and boom, like we, we
could do most contracts that way.

698
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:14,943
Uh,

699
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:19,840
and so white collar jobs like that I
think are going to be at risk in the next

700
00:39:19,841 --> 00:39:24,140
10, 20 years because it's going to be
so easy to do things like contracts, uh,

701
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:29,050
or accounting, you know, these kinds
of things are ais for real obviously.

702
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:32,350
And you guys all know that from deep
mind and the impact that's going to have,

703
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,640
and that's a horizontal impact.

704
00:39:33,641 --> 00:39:38,641
So when you have something like AI and
machine learning hitting at this pace and

705
00:39:39,071 --> 00:39:42,780
people learning about it this quickly
and implementing it, tensorflow,

706
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:46,450
all this other stuff, like it's
getting easier to implement Watson,

707
00:39:46,451 --> 00:39:50,290
etc. So that means you're going to have
a whole group of entrepreneurs being

708
00:39:50,291 --> 00:39:54,820
backed by angels to try to,
you know,

709
00:39:54,821 --> 00:39:59,650
we do every vertical to make an AI.
And if you enabled,

710
00:39:59,651 --> 00:40:02,500
if you look at Google photos, I
think it's a great example. You know,

711
00:40:02,501 --> 00:40:04,600
Google photos is just
anticipating what I want.

712
00:40:04,601 --> 00:40:07,850
And I don't know if anybody works on
Google photos here, but high five. Um,

713
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,810
do you guys uh, crushing it? I mean like,

714
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:15,190
I'm like a download Google photos from
my phone. Like for a year people like,

715
00:40:15,191 --> 00:40:18,790
you have to get Google photos on your
iPhone. I'm like, no, I don't. I already,

716
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,120
I got Icloud, I'm paying for it. And
then I get Google photos. I'm like, oh,

717
00:40:22,121 --> 00:40:23,200
that's pretty dope. Like, you know,

718
00:40:23,201 --> 00:40:26,080
it's telling me like I should check out
these photos and it's like telling me

719
00:40:26,081 --> 00:40:28,120
like, look here, we made a video for
you because we know you like videos.

720
00:40:28,121 --> 00:40:28,811
It's kind of scary.

721
00:40:28,811 --> 00:40:32,890
Like it's figuring out what I like and
I'm delighting me every day and it's

722
00:40:32,891 --> 00:40:35,470
obviously juicing machine learning
and AI to figure that out.

723
00:40:35,471 --> 00:40:38,620
And it's going to only get scarier
and better as time goes on.

724
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,750
So I think that's pretty,
pretty real.

725
00:40:40,751 --> 00:40:43,330
And I think robotics is the one
that was another false start.

726
00:40:43,331 --> 00:40:48,130
We had all of these Roombas and
segways and other, you know,

727
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,690
robotic ish devices,

728
00:40:49,691 --> 00:40:53,270
hardware devices that we're going
to change the world and didn't. Um,

729
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,500
and now I have uh,

730
00:40:56,530 --> 00:41:01,180
two startups that are using
robotics in a way that um,

731
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:03,070
our as truly disruptive.

732
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:07,150
The cafe x one is a robotic coffee machine
that maybe you'll see here in Google

733
00:41:07,151 --> 00:41:11,470
one day. Um, I wouldn't be
surprised if you saw it here. Um,

734
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,290
and uh,
it's to coca cola machines wide.

735
00:41:14,291 --> 00:41:17,650
It's got the arm and it makes your coffee
and it makes it perfectly and you can

736
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:18,580
order it on your phone.

737
00:41:18,581 --> 00:41:22,090
It knows the distance you are from the
machine so it makes your coffee and under

738
00:41:22,091 --> 00:41:25,420
60 seconds it gets it perfect every time
it remembers your last instructions.

739
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,930
I want this type of milk. I want this type
of being, I want this type of caffeine.

740
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:33,070
I want this temperature. Like you can
really dial it in. You pick it, you go,

741
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:37,480
it enhance it to you. It
takes under 45 seconds. Uh,

742
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,550
and so the idea of waiting
had intelligentsia,

743
00:41:40,551 --> 00:41:44,390
if we're sia for how long to get a coffee,
that's about 20 minutes.

744
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:49,580
They have the same intelligency or beans
in their machine now and you'll be able

745
00:41:49,581 --> 00:41:52,430
to every airport,
every two gates,

746
00:41:52,431 --> 00:41:56,300
there'll be a cafe x machine and it
will cost one third less to get a cup of

747
00:41:56,301 --> 00:41:58,820
coffee and it will take
19 or nine minutes left.

748
00:41:58,821 --> 00:42:01,060
Everybody's been in that position where
there's like a line for coffee and you

749
00:42:01,061 --> 00:42:01,894
just give up.

750
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:06,320
So the idea of people making coffee for
a living and a robot should be doing

751
00:42:06,321 --> 00:42:06,711
that,
right?

752
00:42:06,711 --> 00:42:09,380
It doesn't make much sense unless you
want to have like the charming experience

753
00:42:09,381 --> 00:42:14,230
of a Barista with suspenders
and a big mustache. Um,

754
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:17,240
that'll still exist somewhere in the
world. And then this other company,

755
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:20,900
lockable is making modular housing
and they're going to use robotics.

756
00:42:20,901 --> 00:42:22,730
So you can be able to take out
your phone or iPad and be like,

757
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:27,020
I just bought this lot over here in
Culver city and I need a house that's like

758
00:42:27,021 --> 00:42:29,210
this dimensions and I
want to have it delivered.

759
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:30,410
And the robot's going to make it.

760
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:33,920
So like prefab modular at
Yahoo that made housing. Yeah.

761
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:39,320
And so it may be the same price, you
know, two or three or $400 a square foot,

762
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:44,800
but it may take out six months or
12 months of time to build a or,

763
00:42:45,921 --> 00:42:49,140
and then eventually it might cost last
actually two. And were my quest, you know,

764
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,240
10, 20, 30% less.

765
00:42:50,241 --> 00:42:53,420
But the time savings will be where the
real savings is and then they might have

766
00:42:53,421 --> 00:42:56,030
four of those factories. So depending
on where you're living in the country,

767
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:00,340
you know, it could be conceivable
that you order out, uh,

768
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:02,750
a nanny unit or an in law unit.

769
00:43:02,751 --> 00:43:07,070
I think they called them in the back of
your place in Culver City and you know,

770
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:10,130
it's outside your house in two days,
two days are the addition,

771
00:43:10,131 --> 00:43:11,900
you laser cut the new door,
boom.

772
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:15,110
And then like literally at like the
crane drops it in your backyard.

773
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:19,980
So housing and coffee, you know, or like
two areas where robotics specialized,

774
00:43:19,981 --> 00:43:22,490
they're going to do really well.
So I really believe in

775
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:28,880
looking at areas where we
had false starts. Because if
you think about, you know,

776
00:43:28,881 --> 00:43:32,480
going back to youtube as an example,
there were hundreds of startups.

777
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:33,860
I tried to do video on the Internet,

778
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:38,510
but the reward for putting a video on
the Internet back then was you would,

779
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:39,680
if it went viral,

780
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:44,120
you got a $5,000 bill and then you
do the video got turned off. I mean,

781
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,220
some people in the room might
be too young to experiences,

782
00:43:46,221 --> 00:43:50,030
but it was often that you would go to a
website that went viral and it would say

783
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:51,020
this wet,

784
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:55,270
this user has used up their bandwidth
cap and therefore you can't see the blog

785
00:43:55,271 --> 00:43:57,020
post.
He couldn't afford the video accessible.

786
00:43:57,050 --> 00:44:00,640
You couldn't afford to be successful.
And because of cloud computing, just,

787
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:05,030
you know, uh, Steven and Chad
had this like vision, like, wow,

788
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:08,480
it's cheap enough or we're kind of in
that range where we can kind of let people

789
00:44:08,481 --> 00:44:09,314
host for free.

790
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:12,110
The idea that you could put a video
online without putting your credit card,

791
00:44:12,111 --> 00:44:13,010
Ian was kind of crazy.

792
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:17,630
Now it's like four k video uploaded to
Google free forever, upload it to Itunes,

793
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:22,580
almost free forever. Like as we've
come a long way in 10 years. Uh,

794
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:26,260
so I like to look at those spaces
where people try, try, try.

795
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:31,270
I tried and that's one of the things
that investors totally by and mess up.

796
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:37,560
They always look at their personal history
and knowledge of the space and they

797
00:44:37,561 --> 00:44:42,390
correlate that with, you
know, oh, it hasn't worked
before therefore work, I mean,

798
00:44:42,391 --> 00:44:46,380
Google was the 11th or 12th search engine.
It was just 20 times better.

799
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:50,340
Like page rank was just that much better.
The algorithm was the why.

800
00:44:50,341 --> 00:44:55,341
Now this is like a very complex algorithm
that really made the results Germanna

801
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:57,060
Chablis better. Um, and

802
00:44:58,090 --> 00:44:58,400
okay,

803
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,890
somebody's taking another swing
at bat at an idea that, you know,

804
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:05,870
became 100 million or a billion dollar
company is worth it. And we saw that with,

805
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:10,430
you know, web van versus now
instacart and other all Google,

806
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:15,140
Amazon prime. Now Google has an,
I don't know what it's called in.

807
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:19,430
I don't know if you have the Google
delivery here to have the Google shopping

808
00:45:19,431 --> 00:45:22,310
express up here or is it just in
San Francisco? Tier two. Yeah.

809
00:45:22,311 --> 00:45:25,850
So like all these things that we're
using now, ubereats and Postmates,

810
00:45:25,851 --> 00:45:30,050
like these were things that
were tried cosmo urban fetch,

811
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:35,300
a Web van and now just
gps, logistics, robotics.

812
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:38,450
All of this stuff has gotten so much
better that it's actually working now and

813
00:45:38,451 --> 00:45:40,370
they're going to figure out
the unit economics and it's,

814
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:44,780
it's gonna change the world again to
replaying the hype cycle for new appetite

815
00:45:44,781 --> 00:45:47,630
and new timing. Yup. New
Position. Look at gaming.

816
00:45:47,631 --> 00:45:50,000
Like we had this whole thing
on web gaming. We're casual.

817
00:45:50,001 --> 00:45:51,170
Gaming was going to be a big deal.

818
00:45:51,171 --> 00:45:54,890
And then all of a sudden Facebook
came out and social gaming was a big

819
00:45:54,891 --> 00:45:57,710
revolution.
That apps were a big revolution.

820
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,160
So you keep having these games,
you know,

821
00:46:01,161 --> 00:46:04,790
waves coming one after the other.
And I think we'll have that for ar.

822
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:09,820
I think there'll be an ar gaming wave
that'll be just crazy when you can put

823
00:46:10,611 --> 00:46:13,960
glasses on. I'm like, we're
all playing like paint balls,

824
00:46:13,961 --> 00:46:16,940
Zombie paintball around the
office for an hour. Exactly.

825
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:20,060
It says some people with glasses on
or like watching the zombies attack,

826
00:46:20,061 --> 00:46:23,150
like it's going to be a lot of fun.
So I think there's going to be something.

827
00:46:23,151 --> 00:46:26,960
I think the ar stuff is the, is
really interesting. That's super,

828
00:46:26,961 --> 00:46:31,420
super interesting. Can we open it to
questions? Anyone have any questions for,

829
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:35,060
for Jason? We have a microphone that
they're going to throw the box at you.

830
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:43,670
There. It is sort of,

831
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:47,570
um, so you mentioned that, uh,

832
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:52,370
you started off in journalism and then
broken to investing and you were doing it

833
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:57,200
long distance even from
just looking valley. How did
you break into the kind of,

834
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,510
uh,
bro Mba circles?

835
00:46:59,511 --> 00:47:03,530
Because I guess investing must be a
pretty social activity. Yeah. Again,

836
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:09,120
the sequoia had this idea that they're
entrepreneurs where they invested in the,

837
00:47:10,941 --> 00:47:15,020
had invested in our company,
Mahalo, which is now inside.com. Um,

838
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:20,080
they thought that it would be really cool
for founders to scout out investments

839
00:47:20,691 --> 00:47:23,760
for them. And that's actually how
I did my first 15 or so investment.

840
00:47:23,761 --> 00:47:27,560
So I was kind of pushed
into it by sequoia. Um,

841
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:29,150
because they had this idea to do scouts,

842
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:33,090
then they kind of created a monster
and I started doing it on my own. Um,

843
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:37,330
but now since that time I used to host
something called open Angel Forum,

844
00:47:37,331 --> 00:47:38,164
which was just,

845
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:42,640
I would have a conference room at a law
firm or at somebody's house and invite

846
00:47:42,641 --> 00:47:44,530
10 angel investors to see companies.

847
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:48,010
And actually thumbtack and Uber
both came to open Angel Forum,

848
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:50,910
which was Angel List, but in person. Uh,

849
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:53,830
and so now angel list exists
in these syndicates exist.

850
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:58,480
The best way to break in is to just
join as many syndicates that you can.

851
00:47:58,481 --> 00:48:02,590
Funders, club, Angel List SeedInvest
and just watch the deal flow go by.

852
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:06,280
And then you could do one
of two scenarios. One,

853
00:48:06,281 --> 00:48:09,820
you could play fantasy sports where
you read the deal memos and you'll say,

854
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,830
I think this is going to
work for these reasons.

855
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:13,870
I don't think it's going
to work for these reasons.

856
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:18,640
And my conviction level is
between one and 10. It's a seven.

857
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:23,890
And so I'm gonna pretend I put in $5,000
and I'm going to remind myself every

858
00:48:23,891 --> 00:48:27,820
six months on this Google sheet to
check it on the company's valuation.

859
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:30,250
See if they raise more money and
to see if I'm good at picking.

860
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:33,700
And you could do it in a moneyball
fantasy sports kind of way,

861
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:35,800
which is what I tell young
people in colleges. You,

862
00:48:35,801 --> 00:48:38,740
you're just like creating
a virtual portfolio. Um,

863
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:40,210
but now if you have a little bit of money,

864
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:43,810
I think doing this micro investing
and putting real money on the table,

865
00:48:43,811 --> 00:48:48,340
we'll make your senses go
a little bit. Uh, you know,

866
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:52,450
just like playing poker for money changes
it when you're playing for, you know,

867
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:56,080
um, you know, pennies or f for fake money.

868
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:00,700
So I like the idea of going to a casino
and playing poker for a $1 $2 while

869
00:49:00,701 --> 00:49:01,300
you're learning,

870
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:03,040
even though you're going to burn
through a couple of hundred bucks,

871
00:49:03,041 --> 00:49:06,550
you're going to play these tournaments
and you'll feel the sting of losing your

872
00:49:06,551 --> 00:49:10,900
40 bucks. You need to have that pain. So
I liked that pain for you specifically.

873
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:15,970
You look like you need to feel that pain.
So I would say just go on Angeles.

874
00:49:15,971 --> 00:49:16,810
Join all this indicates,

875
00:49:16,811 --> 00:49:20,290
go on seed investor and all the
syndicates and trust your gut.

876
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:25,180
Make 10 bets of $1,000 each and see
how you wind up. Now here's the secret.

877
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:29,110
You know, you're building networks
is not as hard as people think.

878
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,490
If you do those 10 investments,

879
00:49:30,491 --> 00:49:34,120
you put $1,000 in each act as
if you put 10 or $100,000 in,

880
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:37,630
which is to say email the email
the founder, introduce yourself,

881
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:40,360
follow them on Twitter,
favorite and retweet what they do.

882
00:49:40,361 --> 00:49:44,950
Look at their job board and check
in with them every 60 days and say,

883
00:49:44,951 --> 00:49:46,600
how's it going?
Is there any way it can help?

884
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:51,040
And then find all your co investors in
the company by looking at crunchbase or

885
00:49:51,041 --> 00:49:53,710
mattermark or any of the
publicly available places,

886
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:58,810
but that been a Google sheet and then
email the hundred of them with a mail

887
00:49:58,811 --> 00:50:00,880
merge and say,
Hey,

888
00:50:00,881 --> 00:50:04,300
I noticed were co-investors
in Acme company together?

889
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:07,030
Was wondering if you had any interest
in companies you're looking at?

890
00:50:07,031 --> 00:50:11,410
I'm looking, I'm breaking into
angel investing. Um, and uh,

891
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,090
I'm investing in this company next.

892
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:15,790
So I started doing that in the early
days I was telling people like, Hey,

893
00:50:15,791 --> 00:50:17,740
have you seen anything interesting?
And little,

894
00:50:17,741 --> 00:50:21,160
I would do a mail merge like that
where I would email 50 people and say,

895
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:24,520
have you met any interest in companies?
Like one sentence.

896
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,770
And I would say half of the time people
would respond and then some people

897
00:50:27,771 --> 00:50:29,230
respond three or four times.
Yeah.

898
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:30,560
Meeting with this company
I met with that company.

899
00:50:30,561 --> 00:50:32,070
People are more than happy to share,

900
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:37,040
share deal flow because in
the early stages you need
probably 30 40 50 investors

901
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,470
before the company gets
ready for a series a.

902
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:43,610
So if you're one of the first 10 that
means there's another 40 spots left to

903
00:50:43,611 --> 00:50:47,110
fill. If you're investor 50
they might only be, you know,

904
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,350
a couple of investments left.

905
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:52,430
So that's how you build that network is
you just email your co investor and say,

906
00:50:52,431 --> 00:50:56,510
we're co investors in this. That makes
you, you know, like a family members.

907
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:59,840
You're now on a first name basis because
you're both invested in Uber together

908
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:02,720
or this company together. And what,
what other deals are you looking at?

909
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:06,590
People really don't understand how easy
it is to build a network in today's

910
00:51:06,591 --> 00:51:09,170
environment with all this
information online, it's super easy.

911
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:13,130
Does that mostly work when you get a hit?
It's not really like your family? No. No,

912
00:51:13,131 --> 00:51:16,250
because it's sort of like,
it's sort of like poker.

913
00:51:16,251 --> 00:51:18,890
You ever get invited to a poker game
and you're a bad player and you're like,

914
00:51:18,891 --> 00:51:20,530
why are they inviting me? It's like, oh,

915
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:23,600
we need some map layers that they want
your money, they want your money. No,

916
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:26,720
but also you need to fill a table,
right? So we need to fill a table.

917
00:51:26,721 --> 00:51:29,480
Like we have a, we have a company
cafe acts that's just starting.

918
00:51:29,481 --> 00:51:32,090
We need to raise $1 million.
We have 400,000 in,

919
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:35,720
we don't care what that next $600,000 is.
When it's that first round.

920
00:51:35,721 --> 00:51:40,220
We needed to get that $600,000 so they
can prove out in 18 months that this is a

921
00:51:40,221 --> 00:51:41,840
possibility that they
can build the machine,

922
00:51:41,841 --> 00:51:45,410
that they can get to $1,000 a
day and profits, whatever it is.

923
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:50,510
And so again, most people overthink
it and the whole industry is cracked,

924
00:51:50,511 --> 00:51:53,200
wide open because of Angel
List and seed invest.

925
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:58,160
And the reason I wrote the book was
really to try to inspire people to get

926
00:51:58,161 --> 00:51:59,900
involved in it and not overthink it.

927
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:05,390
Investing and losing 1% of your net worth.
If you learn a ton.

928
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:08,540
It's going to be well worth it in my mind.
A quick followup.

929
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:13,310
If you try to tie on overthinking,
do you try to time it in terms of,

930
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:17,720
well, this thing, uh, there's been
not enough false starts quite yet,

931
00:52:17,721 --> 00:52:21,320
or there's this paradigm shift and I
really should be looking in this direction

932
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:24,100
or, yeah, don't overthink it is what I,

933
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:29,030
I think because to the Twitter
example, I didn't, you know, I, I,

934
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:34,480
I understood it could become
a huge cacophony of idiots
yet I miss the obvious.

935
00:52:35,181 --> 00:52:39,920
If it does, who cares if
it's a, if they're idiots
or geniuses, whatever it is,

936
00:52:39,921 --> 00:52:43,310
it's a big thing and big things in
the world generate tons of wealth.

937
00:52:43,311 --> 00:52:47,780
And this thing also in addition to being
a place for idiots to spew hate is a

938
00:52:47,781 --> 00:52:49,590
place where revolutions can start.
Right?

939
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:53,360
So you're saying that if
you don't personally like
something that shouldn't be a

940
00:52:53,361 --> 00:52:55,670
barrier toward,
I think you have to stick,

941
00:52:56,060 --> 00:53:00,740
let go of your ego and what you think of
the idea and what you think of the, uh,

942
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:02,480
possibility that it could work.
Now,

943
00:53:02,481 --> 00:53:05,810
if you're offended by the existence
of something that I don't think you

944
00:53:05,811 --> 00:53:08,330
shouldn't fast, you're not enthusiastic.
But I, I'll give another example.

945
00:53:08,331 --> 00:53:10,370
I didn't have a chance
to invest in Airbnb,

946
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:14,870
but I thought when I heard the airbnb
idea, I literally said to people,

947
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:17,810
they were like, yeah, you let, you can
rent your couch. It's like couch surfing,

948
00:53:17,811 --> 00:53:21,020
so you let somebody sleep on your couch.
And I'm like, like a serial killer.

949
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:24,410
So like I led a serial killer
sleep on my couch. Or like,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

950
00:53:24,411 --> 00:53:27,360
They're all like, it's a community.
And I'm like, I've serial killers.

951
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:28,561
And they're like,
no,

952
00:53:28,561 --> 00:53:32,040
it's not like you could or you could
stay on someone's couch for like 50 bucks

953
00:53:32,041 --> 00:53:35,130
or 30 bucks if you go to, you know,
if you couldn't afford to go to Paris,

954
00:53:35,131 --> 00:53:38,070
you could stay in Paris for 30 bucks.
That's like on a serial killers couch.

955
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:41,340
Like how many people here
have stayed in an airbnb?

956
00:53:41,341 --> 00:53:43,860
Raise your hand if you stayed
in an airbnb. It's everybody.

957
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,560
How many people have hosted
somebody as an airbnb host?

958
00:53:46,561 --> 00:53:49,320
Raise your hand if you've ever done
an IRB house. One person. Okay,

959
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:52,910
how do you do?
I could net,

960
00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:56,160
I could never have somebody in my
house who I don't know and do this.

961
00:53:56,161 --> 00:53:59,120
Like I'm just not brave enough to do
that. And sure enough, I was like,

962
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:03,360
like how do you stop a meth head from
renting a place and just carrying it to

963
00:54:03,361 --> 00:54:05,700
the ground and ripping it apart and
having a meth party. Like sure enough,

964
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:07,620
like year two of Airbnb,

965
00:54:07,621 --> 00:54:10,440
it was like there's a meth party at this
woman's house and they took all their

966
00:54:10,441 --> 00:54:14,220
photos and they made their own collages
and put like kill everybody on the walls.

967
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:18,240
And it was like the most horrific
horror movie ever. And I was like, Yep,

968
00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:21,150
just like a hotel room. I was
like, oh, I see. I overthought it.

969
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:23,880
Like everywhere there is a,

970
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:27,360
there's 20 meth parties going on
right now in hotels in Los Angeles.

971
00:54:27,361 --> 00:54:31,110
We not aware of them,
but this is what people do in hotels.

972
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:33,840
There's not parties going on I guess.

973
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:36,540
So like it's of course it's going to
happen in Airbnb and there's whatever.

974
00:54:36,541 --> 00:54:38,910
So you have to be able to like again,
right?

975
00:54:38,911 --> 00:54:41,640
The long list of why it's not going to
work is that there's going to be a math

976
00:54:41,641 --> 00:54:44,760
party or somebody in to
tragically, uh, you know,

977
00:54:44,761 --> 00:54:48,360
a ride sharing service is going to flip
a car and people are going to die. Like,

978
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:52,440
or an airplane's going to die. You know,
people are going to die in an airplane.

979
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:54,750
I just couldn't get through it in my mind.

980
00:54:54,751 --> 00:54:58,830
So I think sometimes taking yourself and
your understanding of the issue in the

981
00:54:58,831 --> 00:55:01,230
market out of it,
and just looking at the founder,

982
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:04,080
are they passionate and are
they making a great product?

983
00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:07,170
If they're able to make a great product
and they're passionate and they're smart,

984
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:10,830
well, if the product doesn't
get that uptake from users,

985
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:14,220
they're probably gonna pivot a bit
and figure out another product.

986
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:19,650
Whereas a team of idiots who have such a
great story about how big the market is,

987
00:55:19,651 --> 00:55:22,980
but they can't build a really great
product, they're not going to succeed.

988
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:27,480
They're just not going to succeed. Cool.
Thanks. I think you have a question here.

989
00:55:27,481 --> 00:55:29,370
In the other hand I'll do shorter answers.

990
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:33,330
What about the people raising
money with virtual currency?

991
00:55:33,331 --> 00:55:35,460
Now it's a great question.
Um,

992
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:40,940
I have looked at the companies and I
would say the first wave of ISOS are

993
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:44,970
extremely scary.
It reminds me of the.com bubble.

994
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:46,770
So I'd be very careful.

995
00:55:47,490 --> 00:55:50,970
People who have crazy
ideas have not built them.

996
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:56,050
Raising 30 million or $100 million
is a recipe for disaster. Um,

997
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,200
in the height of the Dotcom boom,

998
00:55:58,710 --> 00:56:03,270
we had people raising money or taking
companies public based on the idea that

999
00:56:03,271 --> 00:56:06,120
they would raise $100 million and then
figure out what to do with it. Right.

1000
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:07,740
There was a company called Cmgi,

1001
00:56:07,741 --> 00:56:11,520
I remember that was like an incubator
and all these companies were going public

1002
00:56:11,521 --> 00:56:13,290
with the idea that they
would create companies.

1003
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:17,010
She had people who are creating
ICO for products that don't exist,

1004
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:21,390
that are crazy ideas. We'll
one of them work. Sure, we'll
99 of them fell probably.

1005
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:24,070
And so I,
and then where's this money coming from?

1006
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:28,030
And this money is dark money from,
I think the crypto boom.

1007
00:56:28,031 --> 00:56:31,800
So people have a ton of a theory and
we're a ton of bitcoin. Like, okay,

1008
00:56:31,801 --> 00:56:33,970
I will diversify it.
So I'll buy all these ICRS.

1009
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:38,440
It feels like the ultimate Ponzi
scheme to me. It's real technology.

1010
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:41,800
It could have a real impact.
But this early cohort,

1011
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:46,660
I would not be surprised if almost all
of them went to zero and all of that

1012
00:56:46,661 --> 00:56:50,980
money got burned and there were massive
lawsuits around it and that there was

1013
00:56:50,981 --> 00:56:55,640
massive fraud occurring. Right now.
I believe Bitcoin is probably, uh,

1014
00:56:55,660 --> 00:57:00,250
one of the most massively manipulated
currencies in the world where most

1015
00:57:00,251 --> 00:57:01,540
manipulated things in the world.

1016
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:05,560
What's to stop somebody from creating
100,000 wallets were 10 of us from

1017
00:57:05,561 --> 00:57:08,680
creating a hundred thousand wallets each
and moving a bunch of bitcoins around,

1018
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:09,461
uh,

1019
00:57:09,461 --> 00:57:14,410
and making it look like there's all this
volume and then making the sh the share

1020
00:57:14,411 --> 00:57:14,981
price go up.

1021
00:57:14,981 --> 00:57:19,981
Like there's a lot of ability to
manipulate anonymous currencies and um,

1022
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:23,350
the sec is not very,
uh,

1023
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:25,650
we talked a little bit earlier about
non accredited versus unaccredited.

1024
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:30,010
Like the SEC. They do not have a, um,

1025
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:32,350
a, uh, what's the right way to say it?

1026
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:37,540
They're not looking for
creative solutions, uh,

1027
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:42,280
to be put into the market with people's
money at risk. They're risk averse,

1028
00:57:42,281 --> 00:57:46,960
they're whole reason to exist is to
protect people from losing their money and

1029
00:57:46,961 --> 00:57:47,794
being tracked.

1030
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:50,680
These things seem like people could get
tracked and can lose their money and

1031
00:57:50,681 --> 00:57:54,270
then a lot of people are like,
it's not an offering it,

1032
00:57:54,490 --> 00:57:57,130
it's not like a stock offering. And
then the people buying it are buying it.

1033
00:57:57,131 --> 00:57:59,020
When you asked them
why are they buying it,

1034
00:57:59,021 --> 00:58:01,340
they're saying because it's going
to go up in value. But if they're,

1035
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:05,470
if the people buying it believe it's a
security and you are pretending it's not

1036
00:58:05,471 --> 00:58:08,260
while you're cashing in
tens of millions of dollars,

1037
00:58:08,770 --> 00:58:13,000
this is I think a disingenuous. So some
people who are taking in the money in,

1038
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:18,720
I know a are doing things like I'm paying
taxes on it saying it's future revenue

1039
00:58:19,571 --> 00:58:22,510
form software because this
our API calls or whatever.

1040
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:24,300
So they're actually going
to pay their taxes on it,

1041
00:58:24,301 --> 00:58:28,970
pay as if its profits against software
revenue. So I think that's smart. Um,

1042
00:58:29,050 --> 00:58:31,420
I do think that the fund,

1043
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:34,300
having a venture fund
where the LP interests,

1044
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:38,740
the limited partners are in coins and
are on a ledger is inevitable and that

1045
00:58:38,741 --> 00:58:40,390
people will then be able
to trade their interest.

1046
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:44,620
So if you were in the sequoia fund with
Google at the IPO or right before the

1047
00:58:44,621 --> 00:58:48,310
IPO and you want it to sell your shares
to another person or you're a benchmark

1048
00:58:48,311 --> 00:58:52,600
right now in the Uber situation where
Uber and benchmark or fighting, if Uber,

1049
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:57,490
if benchmark shares were freely tradable
and the lps could trade them well they

1050
00:58:57,491 --> 00:59:01,840
might liquidate right now or they might
be wanting to buy from another party.

1051
00:59:01,870 --> 00:59:03,520
Right?
And so you'd have this more fluidity.

1052
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:06,370
So I do think that that
will come very quickly,

1053
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:10,060
like two or three years and
other countries are going
to lead it because we are

1054
00:59:10,061 --> 00:59:11,320
very conservative when it comes to this.

1055
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:15,280
So I think Scandinavian
countries and Asian company,

1056
00:59:15,350 --> 00:59:20,020
Asian countries and the companies
are going to be very fluid with it.

1057
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:24,530
But I'm monitoring it because you know,
if you are a fund,

1058
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:28,340
if you have funds like I have
had or have, you know, it's a,

1059
00:59:28,341 --> 00:59:32,990
it's an interesting concept. I'm, I'm
certainly a believer in the technology,

1060
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:38,240
but I also saw a lot of companies I think
in that group that I just thought they

1061
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:40,100
could not clear market
with the venture community.

1062
00:59:40,890 --> 00:59:43,700
Now it doesn't mean the venture community
is perfect or the angel community

1063
00:59:43,701 --> 00:59:44,061
perfect,

1064
00:59:44,061 --> 00:59:47,240
but they tend to know what they're
doing and that machine is a well oiled

1065
00:59:47,241 --> 00:59:49,740
machine that knows how to take risk.
So if there,

1066
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:53,810
if the well oiled machine of Silicon
Valley and venture money and angel money

1067
00:59:54,110 --> 00:59:57,440
passed on investing in these companies
and then they were able to raise from

1068
00:59:57,441 --> 01:00:01,070
dark pools of capital of
unsophisticated people,

1069
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:04,940
I don't know. I don't know if
there's that much wisdom in crowds.

1070
01:00:05,070 --> 01:00:08,870
I'm very worried about it. I think we
have time for a couple more questions.

1071
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:13,640
Do you have a question? Yeah.
Uh, I actually had a couple,
I'm the first one was, um,

1072
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:14,391
on average,

1073
01:00:14,391 --> 01:00:18,500
how many of your initial
investments significantly
change product direction? Um,

1074
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:22,400
at like prototyping stage or
initial customer base. Um,

1075
01:00:22,430 --> 01:00:25,010
and then another question would be on,
um,

1076
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:29,630
how many investments have you made or
how do you usually see where you're

1077
01:00:29,631 --> 01:00:33,050
investing in someone who's a,
also like for example,

1078
01:00:33,051 --> 01:00:35,100
like working at Google but has legal,
uh,

1079
01:00:35,101 --> 01:00:39,120
acceptance to work on a product on the
side or maybe any of the big five and

1080
01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:40,450
that have, uh, have,

1081
01:00:40,490 --> 01:00:44,970
have done very well those companies
and they let her on quit of course. Um,

1082
01:00:44,971 --> 01:00:48,980
and then maybe just how you see in terms
of a silica, US Southern California,

1083
01:00:49,010 --> 01:00:52,080
excluding silicone valley, where do you
see southern California against, uh,

1084
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:55,640
the other, uh, cities
in the u s yeah, so we,

1085
01:00:55,660 --> 01:01:00,010
we talked before technology and talent
can come from anywhere. So I don't think,

1086
01:01:00,011 --> 01:01:00,610
um,

1087
01:01:00,610 --> 01:01:04,210
and I think southern California is so
close to silicon valley and the people in

1088
01:01:04,211 --> 01:01:04,751
Silicon Valley,

1089
01:01:04,751 --> 01:01:08,110
especially investors and people who
live there are kind of tired of silicon

1090
01:01:08,111 --> 01:01:12,130
valley. It's, it's pretty horrible to
live there right now because of cost,

1091
01:01:12,131 --> 01:01:15,910
because of homelessness, because of
crime. It's much better to live here, uh,

1092
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:18,940
to be honest. Like it's a much better
lifestyle, like five times better.

1093
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:22,540
So I think you have a lot of them
who are moving down here. Uh,

1094
01:01:22,541 --> 01:01:25,210
and a lot of people who are willing to
move down here because it's literally

1095
01:01:25,211 --> 01:01:30,200
like, it's like a borrow, right?
It's a one hour flight. Um,

1096
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:34,420
to your question about people
doing their side hustle,

1097
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:38,770
I think most investors like to see a
clean break because they want to know that

1098
01:01:38,771 --> 01:01:39,520
you're all in.

1099
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:44,050
So I generally don't invest when people
are doing those kind of side hustles. Uh,

1100
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:47,020
even if they have permission, we
want to get a clean break. No,

1101
01:01:47,021 --> 01:01:50,560
you're full time on it and then make the
investment but willing to meet and see

1102
01:01:50,561 --> 01:01:51,394
the prototype.

1103
01:01:51,610 --> 01:01:56,290
But I've been in a lot of cases where
people have those side hustles and they've

1104
01:01:56,291 --> 01:02:01,210
got permission from their manager and
then the big five company is like, yeah,

1105
01:02:01,211 --> 01:02:03,700
we're going to pull you back in cause
we kind of liked your side hustle and

1106
01:02:03,701 --> 01:02:05,170
let's get that back in the company.

1107
01:02:05,590 --> 01:02:09,130
So because those big five
are so competitive with
startups now and aware of the

1108
01:02:09,131 --> 01:02:11,090
startup ecosystem,
um,

1109
01:02:11,590 --> 01:02:14,710
I think a clean break is the wisest way
to go if you want to raise from serious

1110
01:02:14,711 --> 01:02:19,680
people. Um, and most companies
pivot here and there.

1111
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:20,460
Um,

1112
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:25,080
the term pivot used to mean taking
what you've learned and changing your

1113
01:02:25,081 --> 01:02:26,490
direction slightly.

1114
01:02:27,230 --> 01:02:30,150
One foot staying where it is
and then you're moving around.

1115
01:02:30,570 --> 01:02:34,440
The word pivot somehow meant dropping
the existing idea and coming up with a

1116
01:02:34,441 --> 01:02:39,360
completely different idea. That's
not the term pivot as we all use it,

1117
01:02:39,390 --> 01:02:40,110
but people are like,

1118
01:02:40,110 --> 01:02:44,490
we're pivoting and pivoting now in
silicon valley means this fouled.

1119
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:49,320
Now we're doing this. That's not
pivoting. Pivoting is we were going to go,

1120
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:52,740
you know,
and do video for the enterprise.

1121
01:02:52,741 --> 01:02:57,540
But then we found this new
class of prosumers so we're
kind of going to make it

1122
01:02:57,750 --> 01:03:01,050
pro-sumer where it's free for most
people and paid for the elite people.

1123
01:03:01,051 --> 01:03:04,500
But it's not going to be an enterprise
video solution anymore. Cause we, we,

1124
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:07,230
we realized the enterprise, you
know, they'd like to roll their own.

1125
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:09,540
That would be a pivot.
You're staying in the same vertical,

1126
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:11,520
you're shifting the
customer base a little bit,

1127
01:03:11,521 --> 01:03:13,860
but the product and everything
is in the same zone.

1128
01:03:13,861 --> 01:03:17,580
So that happens in almost every
company where you learn as you go.

1129
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:18,590
It's very few get it right.

1130
01:03:18,591 --> 01:03:23,591
And in fact if you look at Uber like is
going into ride sharing and Uber Pool a

1131
01:03:24,961 --> 01:03:29,070
pivot. No, but maybe in
the classic term it was,

1132
01:03:29,071 --> 01:03:32,250
we started with black cars,
Lincoln town cars, expensive cars.

1133
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:36,960
We pivoted to ride sharing like we
added it, you know, we, we folk,

1134
01:03:36,961 --> 01:03:39,810
we moved our focus over a bit to it.
Um,

1135
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:44,850
so I think it depends on which
definition of pivot you're going with.

1136
01:03:45,270 --> 01:03:49,500
Um, but you know, there, there are
people like Stewart Butterfield who did,

1137
01:03:49,870 --> 01:03:53,700
who did flicker after doing a failed video
game and did slack after doing a fail

1138
01:03:53,701 --> 01:03:58,050
video game. I mean, basically if he had,
if he does a v another video game company,

1139
01:03:58,051 --> 01:04:01,230
I'm investing, it's just for the
pivot, really good video game.

1140
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:06,150
The video game will never be released
and $1 billion company will come out the

1141
01:04:06,151 --> 01:04:06,631
other side.

1142
01:04:06,631 --> 01:04:10,320
That has something to do with the team
that's building the failed video game.

1143
01:04:11,070 --> 01:04:13,500
Like the second he succeeds at a
video game, I'm going to be worried.

1144
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:20,620
All right. Is the felon back still
here? It doesn't look like he is. Um,

1145
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:24,520
I think that's all the time we had
for questions. Thank you so much. Uh,

1146
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:27,780
if anybody wants me to sign their book,
I'm willing to do that as well. All right.

1147
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:28,540
Thank you very much.
