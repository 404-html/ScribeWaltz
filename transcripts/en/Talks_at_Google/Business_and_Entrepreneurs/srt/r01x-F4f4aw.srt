1
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:08,280
Yeah,

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,640
it's great to be here today. And, uh,

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,940
it's a tremendous honor to get to
chat with Jimmy Wales. So Jimmy,

4
00:00:14,941 --> 00:00:16,740
why don't you come on? Um, so

5
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:18,110
first of all,

6
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:22,400
everybody knows [inaudible]

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,300
if you go on, if you go to
Wikipedia, you'll notice that his,

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,830
a drawing of him or a picture of him
appears asking you to give money.

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:37,100
So if you're one of the hundreds of
millions of people who go to Wikipedia

10
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,190
practically every day, um, you'll
know his face. This is him.

11
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,340
It's not like Colonel Sanders.
He actually exists. Uh,

12
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,100
so just by a little bit of background.

13
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:51,900
So Jamie started Wikipedia in 2001,
uh,

14
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,750
he launched with Kia in 2004,

15
00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:59,751
which is much more focused
on entertainment and games
and is one of the top 20

16
00:01:01,171 --> 00:01:04,830
websites worldwide.
And in 2015,

17
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:09,540
he started the Wikipedia foundation
and most recently this year he started

18
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:13,830
something called Wiki Tribune
with the goal to fight fake news.

19
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,280
And,
um,

20
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,290
you described it as news by
the people and for the people.

21
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,430
And the first time that professional
journalists and citizen journalists will

22
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:27,030
work side by side. So, uh, let's go back.

23
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,410
Let's rewind back to when you
started. You've described, um,

24
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,030
the initial group that helped you
start Wikipedia is a, I'm quoting here,

25
00:01:36,031 --> 00:01:39,120
rag tag band of volunteers.

26
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,490
If you can remember back,

27
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:47,040
what was it like to start something that
has become such a worldwide phenomenon?

28
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:52,020
Yeah, well, I mean this was in the
very, very early days of Wikipedia.

29
00:01:52,021 --> 00:01:56,550
We were just a, you know, a really a
small group of people. And, uh, you know,

30
00:01:56,551 --> 00:01:59,070
before Wikipedia had a
project called new PDF,

31
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,370
which has the same goal to have
a free encyclopedia for everyone.

32
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,160
But I didn't really
understand online communities.

33
00:02:05,161 --> 00:02:07,950
I didn't have any idea
about the concept of a Wiki.

34
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,100
And so we organized a very top down
system with [inaudible] as a review to get

35
00:02:13,951 --> 00:02:16,530
anything published. Uh,
and that was a failure.

36
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:21,030
It was a failure mainly because it was
really intimidating for anybody to get

37
00:02:21,031 --> 00:02:24,150
involved. Um, and uh,

38
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,030
we have the course of a year,
uh,

39
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,980
we had created about two
dozen entries. Um, I joke,

40
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,670
I still keep them by my bed and
read them every night. I thought,

41
00:02:35,671 --> 00:02:38,960
we'll get my money's worth someday. What
were, what were some of the, to do death.

42
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,070
They were just very eclectic.
Uh,

43
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,320
but I mean there were so few that and
there were very academic and so forth. Um,

44
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,090
and then, you know, really realized
that that wasn't working and, uh,

45
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,880
decided to pivot,
although nobody called it pivot back then,

46
00:02:53,881 --> 00:02:57,360
but nobody should call it
that anymore. Yeah, exactly.

47
00:02:57,361 --> 00:03:02,080
I'm about done with that word.
Um, and launched the Wiki.

48
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,340
Uh, and in two weeks we had as
much work done as we had, uh, in,

49
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:11,110
well it was actually nearly two years. So,
uh, so that was the, the very beginning.

50
00:03:11,111 --> 00:03:13,930
And the truth is in the, in
the very early days, I mean,

51
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:18,790
the software was in no kind of state.
Um, I had downloaded a used model Wiki,

52
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:23,410
which was a pearl, um, script,
very simple wiki package.

53
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:27,280
Uh, it was so simple in fact that
there were, there were no passwords.

54
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,100
So you could create a user name,
but you didn't have a password.

55
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:34,570
So anybody could pretend to be anybody,
um, which clearly doesn't scale very well.

56
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:39,460
Um, so one of the first things I did
was sort of right, you know, a password,

57
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,960
uh, sort of, uh, ability
to have a password and uh,

58
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,220
but still what was great about Wikis is,
is the word Wiki.

59
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,000
It comes from a Hawaiian word Wiki Wiki
meaning quick, quick collaboration.

60
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:55,600
Like people were able to just turn in
because although we had been going for

61
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:58,120
about two years and
hadn't gotten much done,

62
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,480
there were a lot of people who were super
interested in super excited about this

63
00:04:01,481 --> 00:04:04,750
concept of a free
encyclopedia for everyone. Um,

64
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,510
and so we were able to
pretty quickly move forward,

65
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,250
but we were able to do it. I
mean, there was no, like again,

66
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,400
people didn't say minimal
viable product back then.

67
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,940
It was just like this crappy perl script
and we were just in sort of doing stuff

68
00:04:18,941 --> 00:04:20,680
on a day to day basis to
try and make it better.

69
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:26,060
When you take apart Wikipedia as
you really founded an invented it,

70
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:31,830
there's a couple of unique things.
One of them is that practically,

71
00:04:31,831 --> 00:04:36,831
but anybody can post one of the others
that that isn't so parent is this massive

72
00:04:38,191 --> 00:04:43,191
community of people who totally unpaid
and a lot of cases totally anonymous who

73
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:51,890
edit and make sure that every entry
fits to really tip to you to Wikipedia

74
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:54,294
standards.

75
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:57,770
Yeah, I mean I think there's
a few elements of that that
are really important to

76
00:04:57,771 --> 00:05:02,030
understand. So first of all, I,
you know, the word community,

77
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:06,260
a online community as much abused and
oftentimes what people mean by that,

78
00:05:06,261 --> 00:05:09,500
it's just the general public. But for
me, when I use the word community,

79
00:05:09,501 --> 00:05:12,920
it's people who actually know each other.
Uh, and they're discussing and debating.

80
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,490
They're actually making
decisions. Uh, and so it,

81
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:20,960
if your mental model of how Wikipedia
works is 100 million people adding one

82
00:05:20,961 --> 00:05:24,230
sentence each and it magically becomes
an encyclopedia, that isn't the case.

83
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:28,070
It's really a core group of
volunteers who enforced the rules,

84
00:05:28,071 --> 00:05:30,290
who decide what the rules are,
um,

85
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,320
who put into place organize procedures
and processes to monitor things,

86
00:05:35,361 --> 00:05:37,070
to update things.
Uh,

87
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:40,580
just as one example is the
concept of a wiki project.

88
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,510
So one of my favorite wiki
project is wiki project bridges.

89
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:47,630
So this is a group of people who
are really interested in bridges,

90
00:05:47,631 --> 00:05:48,980
the architecture,
the history,

91
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,120
and they go through all of Wikipedia and
they find all the articles having easier

92
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,560
experts,
interested amateurs.

93
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,880
Um, a mix actually. So I,

94
00:05:58,881 --> 00:06:02,990
one of the guys who I met who was one of
the leaders of the Wiki project bridges

95
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:06,350
is an architect. Um, but
many of the people aren't,

96
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,220
they're just interested hobbyists.
Uh,

97
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,440
and so they go through all these articles
and they come up with checklists of,

98
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,720
okay,
what does a good bridge article look like?

99
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:18,290
What does it mean to have included which
ones don't have those elements and can

100
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:19,340
we research and find that?

101
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,310
And so there's a lot of that kind of
work that goes on beneath the surface and

102
00:06:22,311 --> 00:06:25,130
it really is small groups who
know each other, who say, okay,

103
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:28,700
well we're going to take on this
particular topic. Another fantastic one,

104
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:33,080
a particularly strong in English.
Wikipedia is wiki project medicine. Uh,

105
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:36,130
and they are quite fearsome in there.
Uh,

106
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:40,310
demands that the rules be followed
because the medical topics or, you know,

107
00:06:40,311 --> 00:06:44,120
people rely on it. It's really
important that I be, uh, are very,

108
00:06:44,121 --> 00:06:48,500
very careful about things that could
mislead the public and so forth. So,

109
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:52,280
uh, yeah. So, and why
do people contribute?

110
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,880
Is it you talked about a community
of people that know each other.

111
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,910
Is it a dedication to it?

112
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:03,440
Is it prestige among the other people
that they know in this community? So,

113
00:07:03,441 --> 00:07:06,560
so it's, uh, it's a couple of
things. Um, so first of all,

114
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:10,940
the vision of free encyclopedia for every
single person on the planet in their

115
00:07:10,941 --> 00:07:15,470
own language is exciting. Uh, people
think that's worth spending time on.

116
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,710
So, you know, if you're someone
you could have, you know,

117
00:07:18,711 --> 00:07:23,450
you could spend the weekend playing
grand theft auto, uh, and then, you know,

118
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,010
late Sunday night you realize you've
just wasted two days of your life, uh,

119
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,290
that you'll never get back and you haven't
improved the world. Very productive.

120
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:34,520
Uh, or you can, you know,
work on Wikipedia and
whatever may come of it. You,

121
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:36,140
you come away thinking,
Hey, you know what?

122
00:07:36,141 --> 00:07:38,930
The world's a little bit better
now than it was when I started.

123
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:43,190
So that Grand Vision, uh, is
important, but also it has to be fun.

124
00:07:43,191 --> 00:07:46,130
People have to find it interesting.
You have to meet other Nice,

125
00:07:46,131 --> 00:07:48,470
interesting people who are, uh, you know,

126
00:07:48,471 --> 00:07:51,890
you're learning things and you're
meeting people and you're having quality

127
00:07:51,891 --> 00:07:54,770
debates, uh, which is hard
to come by on the Internet.

128
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,700
There's plenty of places to have
sort of raging flame wars, uh,

129
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:02,900
but to actually have an interesting
discussion or debate around the quality of

130
00:08:02,901 --> 00:08:06,770
sourcing around some particular
topic, um, people enjoy that.

131
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,940
And so it's gotta be both of
those gotta be, you know, that,

132
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,980
that we feel like we're doing something
productive and we're also are enjoying

133
00:08:12,981 --> 00:08:16,190
it. And so, yeah, it does have
something to do with not prestige.

134
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:20,600
So if you want to become a
well known famous person, uh,

135
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:23,630
on the Internet, I would recommend
being a blogger or something like that.

136
00:08:23,631 --> 00:08:27,440
You know, uh, spend your
time on social media. Uh,

137
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:30,170
but so within the
Wikipedia community though,

138
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,540
we aren't particularly at
anonymous with each other.

139
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35,720
People do know each other and people
have respect and people don't know each

140
00:08:35,721 --> 00:08:39,710
other virtually, or do they actually know
each other in person? Mostly virtually.

141
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,670
But it depends. Uh, it actually, that
depends very much on the language.

142
00:08:43,671 --> 00:08:47,360
So if you think about,
uh, for example, uh,

143
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,100
Lithuanian Wikipedia,

144
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,610
virtually everyone who speaks
Lithuanian lives within a train, right,

145
00:08:52,611 --> 00:08:54,140
of each other.
Uh,

146
00:08:54,141 --> 00:08:56,970
and so they tend to have and they get
together for a beer and they actually know

147
00:08:56,971 --> 00:09:00,240
each other pretty well. Uh, other
languages like English of course,

148
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,850
is spread all around the world. And so
often has people talking to each other,

149
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:06,500
but people do meet up, they
meet up locally, uh, they
meet up all over the world.

150
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,880
We have our conferences
and things like that.

151
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,000
Of course, one of the topics
and putting aside the, the,

152
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:17,790
the last election board
and the topics overall is,

153
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,120
is verifying information. And, uh,

154
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:25,770
everybody's a aware of some
of the famous Wikipedia hacks.

155
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,050
So for example,
uh,

156
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,460
I used to run MTV networks and one of our
companies is Nickelodeon and there was

157
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,980
the Wikipedia page for
both mnm and sponge.

158
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,880
Bob said that m and m was
the voice of Spongebob.

159
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:43,440
Now I can assure you that was not the
case or Steven called bear from comedy

160
00:09:43,441 --> 00:09:44,730
Central,
um,

161
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,820
convinced his audience to change
Wikipedia to say that elephants were not

162
00:09:49,891 --> 00:09:51,680
endangered.
What,

163
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,720
what needs to happen to
ensure that these entries,

164
00:09:56,911 --> 00:10:01,800
whether it's about popular culture or
about medicine or about architecture,

165
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,460
what happens to make sure that,
that they're verified?

166
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:09,320
Yeah, just as an example. So they, uh,

167
00:10:09,321 --> 00:10:12,050
when Colburn made this joke on the air,

168
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:16,790
literally within 30 seconds of him
saying the joke, the page was locked,

169
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,610
uh, because the Wikipedia is
actually watched Kobe or two.

170
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:24,260
So the Admin is just winning to lock
the page immediately, uh, and vandalism.

171
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,530
And then we had to cope with it for like
three weeks as people kept trying to

172
00:10:27,531 --> 00:10:30,260
put it in. But we just
kept the page lock. Um,

173
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:34,490
I didn't have time. You mentioned the
Eminem when I had not heard that one.

174
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:39,650
I'm guessing that probably only lasted
in, in Wikipedia for again, a few minutes.

175
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:43,910
Um, I think I know why there's actually,
I saw it on youtube. There's a,

176
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:47,980
uh, spongebob and, uh,

177
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:52,490
lose yourself mash up on youtube
has like 4 million views.

178
00:10:52,491 --> 00:10:54,300
So that's probably where it came from.

179
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,910
That probably became a meme and
then people thought it was funny to,

180
00:10:56,911 --> 00:11:01,860
to have that. Uh, so, and that
sort of thing, it does happen. Uh,

181
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:06,380
usually it's very, very short term.
Uh, and you know, sometimes it isn't.

182
00:11:06,381 --> 00:11:10,800
Sometimes you can have vandalism in
Wikipedia that lasts much longer than we

183
00:11:10,801 --> 00:11:15,620
would like, so it isn't perfect. Um, but
the way it works that we have to have,

184
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,450
you know, if you, again,

185
00:11:17,451 --> 00:11:20,780
if you have the model of Wikipedia is
100 million people all randomly putting

186
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:25,340
stuff in, it would just be, that's
all it would be is just nonsense. Um,

187
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:30,080
but we have a whole bunch of
different, uh, policies, procedures,

188
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:35,060
uh, people become admins, they're
elected by the community, and then, uh,

189
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:38,720
they have the ability and admins
are not like in most sites.

190
00:11:38,721 --> 00:11:40,720
So like if you're on youtube
and you do something,

191
00:11:40,721 --> 00:11:42,870
it's the rules of youtube
in your page gets taken,

192
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:44,840
your video gets taken down
and you're locked out.

193
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:49,740
You actually have no idea who did that.
Somebody's mysterious, deepen, uh,

194
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,170
Google somewhere.
Did it.

195
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:56,020
Whereas in our community that the
admins are all members of the public,

196
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,110
they're all volunteers and
they monitor each other.

197
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:01,780
And there's always debates about,
oh, was this a valid block?

198
00:12:01,781 --> 00:12:04,150
Why don't you block this person?
Uh, et Cetera, et cetera.

199
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:07,990
So they're more like a police.
Um, you know, they're not judge,

200
00:12:07,991 --> 00:12:12,070
jury and executioner. They have certain
abilities to block. People are like pages,

201
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,420
but they have to justify that.

202
00:12:13,421 --> 00:12:16,510
And there are ways that those decisions
can be reviewed and overturned and so

203
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:20,710
forth. So it's, it's like managing
a good municipal government really.

204
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,510
So we have 100 million,

205
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:27,740
uh, users of Wikipedia is how
many people, I mean, this number,

206
00:12:27,741 --> 00:12:31,070
we, we, we want to know how many
people are actually editing today.

207
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:35,030
Yeah. So if you, if you take a
look at the number, so the, the,

208
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:39,920
the best number we have right now is,
uh, for the number of unique devices,

209
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:44,030
the access Wikipedia and a
month is about 1.4 billion.

210
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,710
So that's a lot of people.

211
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:49,100
It's not 1.4 billion people because
probably most people in this room,

212
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:49,934
for example,

213
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:54,110
access Wikipedia in a month on
at least two or three devices.

214
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,300
But it's a huge audience.

215
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:00,440
And then just to give the numbers for
English Wikipedia, there's probably, um,

216
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:05,390
about 70 to 80,000 people who make
at least five minutes in a month,

217
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:10,250
uh, and there's about 3000 people who make
a at least a hundred edits in a month.

218
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:14,600
So it's that 3000 who are the really
active community who really oversee and

219
00:13:14,601 --> 00:13:17,450
manage things. And then there's lots
of people who just add one thing,

220
00:13:17,451 --> 00:13:19,910
which then is reviewed by the
community and so forth. It's pretty,

221
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,130
pretty extraordinary. It's 3000. Yeah.

222
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:26,480
People who, who really make the
really changed the world for the,

223
00:13:26,481 --> 00:13:28,510
for the rest of us you've talked about.

224
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:32,170
Got, you know, it's funny, I was, uh,
a few years back, it just struck me.

225
00:13:32,171 --> 00:13:36,940
I was at Wiki mania as our annual
conference and I had a dinner. I just,

226
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,680
you know, my tray. I went and sat
and I was, okay, look, here's the,

227
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:42,730
the English arbitration committee.
So this is the,

228
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,540
like the Supreme Court of
English, Wikipedia. Um,

229
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:48,070
and we're having dinner and discussing
this, that, and the other policy.

230
00:13:48,071 --> 00:13:50,410
And I left the table and I thought,
you know,

231
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,540
I get to meet a lot of important people,

232
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:57,541
but this is probably some of the most
powerful people in media in the world is

233
00:13:57,641 --> 00:13:59,320
the English, Wikipedia,
arbitration committee. I mean,

234
00:13:59,321 --> 00:14:03,640
they make really big decisions and
they're like a bunch of geeks and nobody,

235
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,110
nobody stick. Nobody outside
their community knows them.
Not really. No. I mean,

236
00:14:08,111 --> 00:14:11,740
occasionally you'll get
a news article about,

237
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:16,720
uh, somebody who's had the most number
of edits and that sort of thing.

238
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,660
And oftentimes the people who,
if you've had the most number of edits,

239
00:14:19,661 --> 00:14:22,480
oftentimes they're running a
Bot. A, that's how you get up.

240
00:14:22,481 --> 00:14:26,890
Very high edit count is to spell checking
or something like that. Not always. Um,

241
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,800
and they're generally
known in the community,

242
00:14:29,801 --> 00:14:34,020
but they aren't always necessarily the
most influential or powerful within the

243
00:14:34,021 --> 00:14:36,850
company. They're just like really
busy as the main thing. So in general,

244
00:14:36,851 --> 00:14:39,920
now nobody really knows who they
are. I mean we do, but yeah.

245
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:44,490
But you've also talked a lot
about AI machine learning.

246
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:49,970
What role will that play in
verifying information in the future?

247
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,123
So,

248
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,220
I mean, what's interesting about this
is sometimes people ask it this way,

249
00:14:55,221 --> 00:14:58,310
or when do you think AI will be
able to write Wikipedia articles?

250
00:14:58,311 --> 00:15:01,670
And I say it's a very long time or,
anyway,

251
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,560
it's one of the highest human activities
is to write a good Wikipedia entry is

252
00:15:06,561 --> 00:15:09,890
really quite a fan. I mean, once we're
there, we're, we're at full general AI.

253
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,450
It's the singularity and let's
just hope they're nice to us. Um,

254
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:19,100
and, but before that, um, I do think
there's some interesting things. Uh,

255
00:15:19,101 --> 00:15:23,780
we have a partnership with
the Jigsaw, uh, where we, uh,

256
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:26,770
it's AI looking at edits and,
and machine learning.

257
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:30,020
I don't actually know very little
about it except it's really cool. Um,

258
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,120
so on Wikipedia,
if you're logged in,

259
00:15:32,121 --> 00:15:35,720
you can go to recent changes in now you
can filter the recent changes and you

260
00:15:35,721 --> 00:15:38,850
can save whatever filter and there's
different things you can select.

261
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,660
So what I do,
this is just my favorite way of filtering.

262
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:45,470
I want to see edits that
are very likely bad,

263
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:51,200
that are likely in good
faith by new users. So this
is somebody new to the site.

264
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,390
They've made an edit,
which is probably bad,

265
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,130
but it was probably made in good faith
and it actually is pretty good at finding

266
00:15:58,131 --> 00:16:01,000
those. And then you what you do.
Then the reason I picked those as,

267
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,650
that's the kind of people that just
go say hi, like, hi, thanks. You know,

268
00:16:03,651 --> 00:16:07,400
it looks like you're trying to do
this. Uh, let's, you know, and, uh,

269
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,500
that's kind of amazing.
So being able to,

270
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:14,140
I think what is interesting here is the
idea of AI basically just, you know,

271
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,990
raising the hand,

272
00:16:14,991 --> 00:16:18,740
raising the flag for a human to review
something because it often gets it wrong.

273
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:22,580
You wouldn't really want AI policing this
sort of thing. So it's assisted review,

274
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:26,870
it's assisted review. Um, and I
think that's very useful, uh, to,

275
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:30,110
and I think this is an area we
will pursue more in various ways.

276
00:16:30,111 --> 00:16:32,330
And Ai is a very broad term,

277
00:16:32,331 --> 00:16:37,331
but the idea of using much
more algorithmic approaches
to bring things to the

278
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:42,650
attention of people, uh, that
you're probably interested.
So just as an example to,

279
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:47,450
um, interest new editors, what we
could do is notice what you're reading.

280
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,500
And so if we see,
okay,

281
00:16:48,501 --> 00:16:52,430
every day you're reading about World
War II and we have over here on article

282
00:16:52,431 --> 00:16:56,480
that we have algorithmic signals is
not very good. We could say, Hey,

283
00:16:56,481 --> 00:16:58,970
you've been reading a lot about World
War II, would you like to help out?

284
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,530
Here's an article that leads
to improvement in recruitment.
Yeah, exactly. Um, and,

285
00:17:03,531 --> 00:17:06,980
or if you're editing, you know,
in an area, then we can say, oh,

286
00:17:06,981 --> 00:17:08,990
here's some similar things that
you might want to edit that,

287
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,600
that need help and that sort of thing.
And we've been very,

288
00:17:11,601 --> 00:17:14,300
very human about all that sort of thing.

289
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,000
We don't have much in the way of
algorithms to look at that sort of thing,

290
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:20,630
but I think there's huge
opportunities there. Um, and,

291
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:23,780
and the great thing about assisted
review or prompting people,

292
00:17:23,781 --> 00:17:28,010
it doesn't have to be perfect to be a lot
better than nothing. Um, you know, if,

293
00:17:28,011 --> 00:17:28,820
if it,

294
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:33,770
if we can start suggesting things to me
that I should edit and I think half of

295
00:17:33,771 --> 00:17:36,260
them are useless and half of them
are actually kind of interesting,

296
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:40,280
that's better than suggesting zero to me.
So how does the community feel about,

297
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:45,140
um, AI did not feel that they should put
some standard around the ta? Yeah, yeah.

298
00:17:45,141 --> 00:17:49,710
They're very, they're very,
um, protective of, uh,

299
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,370
of their turf in a certain way.
But they're also very, these are,

300
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,940
these are quite geeky people.
They're interested in technology.

301
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,500
They're open to saying,
yeah,

302
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:02,330
there's a lot of stuff that humans
aren't very good at that machine,

303
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,140
like very tedious,
boring stuff.

304
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,140
If we can get that machines do that
stuff and raise it to our attention,

305
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,170
then our work is more effective.
Because as I said in the beginning,

306
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,460
one of the reasons people want to edit
Wikipedia is at the end of an hour

307
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,450
editing Wikipedia, if you feel like you
did something useful, that's important.

308
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,320
And so if I go to Wikipedia and I picked
some obscure article and try to improve

309
00:18:22,321 --> 00:18:24,330
a couple of sentences,
I'm never quite sure,

310
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,270
is anybody even going to read that or
whatever. But if you show me like, Oh,

311
00:18:27,271 --> 00:18:30,510
here's a popular article
that is in poor state, okay,

312
00:18:30,511 --> 00:18:33,960
that I'll have an impact if I do that.
So I think people like that sort of idea.

313
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:35,323
Um,

314
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,300
let's shift gears.
Let's talk about education itself.

315
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:42,710
I have a personal experience. I
have two 18 year olds, uh, uh,

316
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:47,300
boy and girl, and they've
gone through school. Um,

317
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:51,490
and one is already in college and
their entire time through school,

318
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:54,970
their teachers have said,
Wikipedia is not a source.

319
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:58,030
You can't use Wikipedia. You
have to go. And by the way,

320
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:02,920
the first place that they go for anything
is Wikipedia, but it's never disclosed.

321
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,810
Um,
and

322
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:09,480
you can tell kids, don't listen to
rock and roll music, but we're well,

323
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:13,390
well past that, right? No, it's actually
more important. It's what you, you,

324
00:19:13,391 --> 00:19:17,970
you protect your parents from doing,
uh, and it's your responsibility.

325
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,160
So,
but coming back to what's,

326
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:25,540
what is it that we could pedia and
other organizations that are around

327
00:19:25,771 --> 00:19:30,420
information, what, what, what's their
responsibility? What's the opportunity?

328
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:35,040
So for us, I mean, we, we
feel a very heavy burden. Um,

329
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:39,700
if we think about, uh,
well 18 year olds, right?

330
00:19:39,701 --> 00:19:41,770
So Wikipedia is now 16 years old.

331
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:46,060
So from the time they were
learning to read Wikipedia existed,

332
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:47,650
it's certainly in the last five years,

333
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:52,510
a five to 10 years when they were old
enough to start doing homework and looking

334
00:19:52,511 --> 00:19:55,510
online or following their own intellectual
interests, whatever that might be,

335
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,100
they go to Wikipedia.

336
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:00,550
And so it's just part of the
infrastructure of the world
as far as their concern,

337
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:04,420
which means we have a responsibility
to make it as good as we possibly can.

338
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:08,380
And when I say we, I include everyone
in this room. I mean, this is a,

339
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:13,180
it's a public resource.
Um, and uh, but what,

340
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:17,800
but it's important to, to know, we don't
consider it to be a goal for Wikipedia,

341
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:22,750
that we be sizable source.
Um, for 18 years old, uh,

342
00:20:22,751 --> 00:20:26,260
entering college any more
than when I was at university,

343
00:20:26,261 --> 00:20:30,490
if I cited Botanica, that would have been
considered ludicrous. That's something,

344
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,530
you know,
and encyclopedia,

345
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:35,470
that's not the role they should play in
the research process in secular media is

346
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,440
the starting point, not the ending
point. Particularly at the college level.

347
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,920
It's like, Hey, if all
you're going to do is look,

348
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:43,900
read Wikipedia and write a paper, I
mean, come on, this is ridiculous.

349
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,460
Read Wikipedia to get oriented,

350
00:20:45,461 --> 00:20:49,240
but then go to the original sources and
doing more interesting intellectual work.

351
00:20:49,241 --> 00:20:50,074
Now,
of course,

352
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,700
if a 13 year old writes something and
adds a footnote and sites Wikipedia,

353
00:20:54,701 --> 00:20:56,290
I'm like, hey, you know, progress.

354
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:59,020
At least they've written something
and they put it in a footnote.

355
00:20:59,021 --> 00:21:01,690
That's okay at a certain age,
but later on,

356
00:21:01,691 --> 00:21:04,150
I don't think that it's not
something we aspire to. Um,

357
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,050
you know,
said.

358
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:10,050
Do you think Wikipedia or
other organizations with
Wikipedia have more of a role

359
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,940
in education? I mean, education
is a huge challenge for sure. Not,

360
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:19,260
not every kid in this country is going
to get to go to college. Uh, what, what,

361
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:22,690
what, what can we could PD
and other organizations do to,

362
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,260
to solve our education problem?

363
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,720
Well, I mean, I think one of
the things that's going on,

364
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:30,140
if you look at the trends
in formal education,

365
00:21:30,141 --> 00:21:33,650
so what percentage of
people are going to college?

366
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,440
That moves around a very little bit,

367
00:21:36,441 --> 00:21:39,560
but it's pretty stable and nothing
dramatic is happening there.

368
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:42,010
A few more people are going to college,
a few lessons,

369
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,360
certain places and certain things.
But in general,

370
00:21:44,361 --> 00:21:46,430
that's a pretty well understood area.

371
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,490
But what is completely
changed in the last 10,

372
00:21:49,491 --> 00:21:54,491
15 years is the amount of informal
learning that people do that,

373
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:58,990
you know, if, if you hear of
directed self directed, uh,

374
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,680
even just ordinary thing. So if
you here, um, oh, I dunno, blah,

375
00:22:03,681 --> 00:22:05,830
blah blah,
there's something going on called bitcoin.

376
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:09,410
I don't really know what that is.
Uh, you know, if it was 25 years ago,

377
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,260
you would go, I don't know, I
read this article in the paper.

378
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:15,740
I don't really get it now. People dig
deep and we see this in our traffic.

379
00:22:15,741 --> 00:22:19,010
You know, people can dictate
all the information's there. Um,

380
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:23,360
and that's really important and it doesn't
result in more degrees and so forth.

381
00:22:23,361 --> 00:22:26,780
But people can learn about anything
they want to learn about very easily.

382
00:22:26,781 --> 00:22:28,550
And that is a huge impact on education.

383
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:32,480
I do think there's a lot to think about.
So for us,

384
00:22:32,481 --> 00:22:37,220
one of the biggest things that we are
interested in is the growth of Wikipedia

385
00:22:37,221 --> 00:22:38,990
in the languages of the developing world.

386
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:43,070
Because of course there are places in
the world where people have very limited

387
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:44,870
access to information.

388
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:48,950
So what was the way I think about
this is if you're an English speaker,

389
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:53,980
one of the things is the solution to
is just narrowing down a place to go to

390
00:22:55,221 --> 00:23:00,110
find basic information. So if I type Queen
Victoria into Google, I'm going to get,

391
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,160
I dunno, millions of pages, the number
one, it's probably going to be Wikipedia.

392
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,180
That's probably what I wanted.

393
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:09,050
I just wanted to get the basic story
of Queen Victoria, her life and times.

394
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:12,800
It's all there. And this is because
we have a glut of information.

395
00:23:12,801 --> 00:23:17,180
But if you're a, you know,
if you're speaking, um,

396
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,880
a, an obscure language, uh,

397
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:23,690
with only a million speakers
and Africa in your language,

398
00:23:23,691 --> 00:23:26,540
there's going to be like the
role of Wikipedia is, hey,

399
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:29,850
it's the only source I have
for Queen Victoria. Uh,

400
00:23:29,851 --> 00:23:33,200
it's the only place I can go for that
information. And not yet in many cases,

401
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,690
we're just really getting started
in a lot of those languages.

402
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,040
So there's a lot of work left to do,

403
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,990
but it's interesting how that
impact will be different, uh,

404
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:43,250
because instead of being saying,
oh, we've got a glut of information,

405
00:23:43,251 --> 00:23:46,310
let's summarize it in an encyclopedia
article. Like we have no information.

406
00:23:46,311 --> 00:23:49,820
So let's share it with, uh, you
know, people, uh, in this way.

407
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,580
Um,
the,

408
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:56,610
the nature of how people interact
with the web is changing dramatically.

409
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,740
And so we,
everyone's aware of the voice interface,

410
00:24:00,741 --> 00:24:04,280
but the reality is the digital assistant,

411
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,410
whether it's Alexa,

412
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:11,000
Google assist or a well
or okay Google or Siri,

413
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:15,590
um, the, these are one of the ways in
which people will access information.

414
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:20,060
How will Wikipedia adapt
to those new interfaces?

415
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,130
So, uh, it is very interesting. I mean,

416
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:26,660
we are an important part of those
interfaces already. Um, you know,

417
00:24:26,661 --> 00:24:28,820
if you ask Alexa a question,

418
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:34,700
99% of the time she's just going to
read Wikipedia to you or get a fact from

419
00:24:34,701 --> 00:24:39,260
Wikipedia. Obviously Google relies a lot
on Wikipedia for the knowledge graph.

420
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:44,060
Uh, I don't actually use
the Google assistant because
I have Alexa at home. Uh,

421
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:48,350
assume it's very similar, although I
heard that if you ask Google a question,

422
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,960
it says according to Wikipedia,
thank you.

423
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:55,550
Whereas Alexa just acts like she knows
everything even though she's just reading

424
00:24:55,551 --> 00:24:58,550
it out of Wikipedia.
So, uh, so there's that.

425
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,980
I need to email Jeff and
it's about that. But, um,

426
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:07,250
but what's interesting for me to ask you
the question, I don't know. I tried Siri,

427
00:25:07,251 --> 00:25:12,140
didn't understand what
I was saying. So, so,

428
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:15,770
uh, in any event,
basically what we're, um,

429
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:20,430
what's interesting to us about that
is w and one of the areas that we,

430
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:23,720
we do slightly worry about it,
but we don't have firm evidence yet.

431
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:27,440
One of the words we have is, and
we're not a business, we're a charity,

432
00:25:27,441 --> 00:25:30,830
so we don't think much about business
model and we've never been very good at

433
00:25:30,831 --> 00:25:33,050
thinking about business model.
Um,

434
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,500
we just are a group of people who are
enjoying making this encyclopedia and

435
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:37,850
we're really happy that
everybody likes it.

436
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,910
But realistically we do have to think
about that. And so right now, uh,

437
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:45,770
the way Wikipedia gets money to survive
is you come to the website and there's a

438
00:25:45,771 --> 00:25:48,040
little banner. Um, very rarely, but yes,

439
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:51,160
you know, once a year you see
your photo does very well.

440
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:54,550
Yeah,
we haven't been using it in recent years.

441
00:25:54,551 --> 00:25:57,940
I'm very happy we found this ugly yellow
banner that no one on Madison Avenue

442
00:25:57,941 --> 00:26:01,100
would think would work, but it works
beautifully. Uh, and actually we are,

443
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:05,350
we are more and more our fundraising is
through the email campaign because our,

444
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:09,430
our donors are very loyal and if you
donate to Wikipedia a year later,

445
00:26:09,431 --> 00:26:12,010
you get a message from me,

446
00:26:12,011 --> 00:26:15,100
which I may or may not have
actually written a that says, hey,

447
00:26:15,101 --> 00:26:17,630
it's been a year of time to
cough up again. And, and it,

448
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:21,880
and it gets a really good response.
Um, but, and so that's a good,

449
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:25,780
that's a good news. What we worry
about is, I call it the, the, the,

450
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:30,940
how old is Tom Cruise problem. So five
years ago, 10 years ago, if you typed,

451
00:26:30,941 --> 00:26:32,890
how old is Tom cruise into Google?

452
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:37,060
The first link was Wikipedia and you go
there and you find out how old was Tom

453
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,770
Cruise.
Now the first link is still Wikipedia,

454
00:26:38,771 --> 00:26:42,760
but up above that it tells you how we'll
talk this because Google understands

455
00:26:42,761 --> 00:26:47,130
the much better Google read Wikipedia for
one thing. And uh, and so we think, okay,

456
00:26:47,131 --> 00:26:50,160
well does that mean we're not seeing
that traffic and does that mean we're not

457
00:26:50,161 --> 00:26:51,840
going to get the donations from people?

458
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,230
So far we don't have any evidence
of that. Uh, and in fact,

459
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:57,960
because the knowledge graph
does link to Wikipedia, I mean,

460
00:26:57,961 --> 00:27:00,660
we see a lot of traffic from that,
so it hasn't yet heard us.

461
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:05,430
But when we think then about a voice
assistant, um, if people are just saying,

462
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:07,560
uh,
who is Tom Cruise?

463
00:27:07,561 --> 00:27:10,280
And you get three sentences from
Wikipedia and people don't know you're

464
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:11,580
concerned about attribution,

465
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:14,100
concerned about attribution and
epit even if there is attribution,

466
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,280
are people going to donate?
We don't know. So far so good.

467
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,630
But that is one thing and
our view is again, the,

468
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:23,100
the fundamental,
you know,

469
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,810
the Vision Statement for Wikipedia is
imagine a world in which every single

470
00:27:27,811 --> 00:27:31,740
person on the planet has given free
access to the sum of all human knowledge.

471
00:27:31,741 --> 00:27:32,574
That's what we're doing.

472
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:37,050
And so in that front and the community's
view on this sort of thing is it's

473
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,090
fucking fantastic.
Like amazing.

474
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,190
We compete as part of the
infrastructure of the world.

475
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,020
All these new technologies are coming out.

476
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,280
The knowledge that we've
carefully stewarded and
written is now helping people,

477
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:51,960
you know, um, you know, when
did Fred Astaire die? Right?

478
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,350
You have that thought in
your kitchen for two seconds.

479
00:27:54,351 --> 00:27:57,330
You can ask Alexa and she
tells you amazing, right?

480
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,480
We don't need to get paid for that.
That's where a charity for,

481
00:28:00,481 --> 00:28:02,550
we want everybody to
have access to knowledge.

482
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:04,710
But there is a little bit
of a question about, okay,

483
00:28:04,711 --> 00:28:08,790
how does our business model
work if in 20 years, you know,

484
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:12,420
as technology changes, we don't want
to let Wikipedia get left behind. So,

485
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,170
but so far we're, I mean we're,
we're doing great financially,

486
00:28:16,171 --> 00:28:20,160
so we always run in a
very conservative way. Um,

487
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:23,470
we asked for money, sometimes
we were getting criticism, uh,

488
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,130
from I think rather stupid
press outlets who say,

489
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:30,330
why is Wikipedia begging for money?
They have 100 million in the bank. Um,

490
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:34,260
and it's like, well, you know, our
annual budget's about 70 million.

491
00:28:34,261 --> 00:28:35,940
So we have about 18 months reserve.

492
00:28:35,941 --> 00:28:39,210
That's considered to be a healthy
level of reserves for a nonprofit.

493
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:43,710
We're not apologetic about that. Um,
but you know, every year we've been,

494
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:48,540
last year, well, thanks to the president,
um, it was not necessarily big fan of us,

495
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:53,070
but who has motivated people to care
about knowledge? Uh, in a roundabout way.

496
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,460
Um,
the day from the day after the election,

497
00:28:56,461 --> 00:28:59,510
we saw a massive increase in donations.
Um,

498
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,740
which was very heartwarming to see
because, uh, you know, and, and we'll,

499
00:29:04,741 --> 00:29:06,660
we'll get onto fake news in a bit when we,

500
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:09,690
when we're talking about
a Wiki Tribune, but, um,

501
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:14,210
but we've decided we are also
raising an endowment fund, um,

502
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,670
because we do think of ourselves not
so much as a, I mean we're not a.com.

503
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:18,650
We're not a tech startup.

504
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,920
We're a charity sharing knowledge
and we try to think in the long run.

505
00:29:22,921 --> 00:29:26,040
And so one of the things we
say is, look, while we're,

506
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:28,920
while we're not in desperate
financial situation,

507
00:29:28,921 --> 00:29:31,440
we should be thinking about the
longterm future. So we've now got,

508
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:36,270
we're raising a hundred million
dollar endowment fund, um, and we're,

509
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:39,270
I think we've got pledges
for about 17 million so far.

510
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,310
And it's really the first time that we've
really tried to have more of a major

511
00:29:42,311 --> 00:29:46,750
donor campaign because the vast majority
of the money for Wikipedia comes from

512
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:50,210
those, you know, you see the banner
and you give 20 bucks and you know,

513
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,580
that's the vast majority of money.

514
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,030
And we've never been really good at
doing major donor stuff. But this is,

515
00:29:55,031 --> 00:29:57,160
we think this is an interesting product.

516
00:29:57,161 --> 00:30:01,210
You might call it for a major donor to
site, don't just fund our annual budget.

517
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,040
Think about the future.
We want,

518
00:30:03,041 --> 00:30:05,590
we keep PD and the idea of be
to be safe in the long run.

519
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:09,250
So we won't have this fund for any
future emergencies or any future

520
00:30:09,251 --> 00:30:12,640
opportunities. And we've done it all the
right way. We've got a separate board.

521
00:30:12,641 --> 00:30:14,110
So there's another layer of governance.

522
00:30:14,111 --> 00:30:18,280
So it's not just a big bank account for
some future profligate CEO and so forth.

523
00:30:18,281 --> 00:30:22,930
So, so far so good. Um, I'm going to ask
everybody for questions a little later,

524
00:30:22,931 --> 00:30:25,990
so please start thinking about them.
But in the meantime,

525
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:31,110
I'd like to welcome or eat cuts of health.
Use Your, um, your cofounder of Wiki.

526
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:33,670
Truebeam yes. So Ori, you were somewhere.

527
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,250
Okay.

528
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:46,190
Hi. So welcome. So what should
we know about Wiki Tribune?

529
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,870
Um, do, let's start. I'll have to let her
start because I'm terrible about just,

530
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:52,070
I could sit here and talk.

531
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:57,290
Uh, how many of you have heard of
wicked driven? Oh, that's great. Okay.

532
00:30:57,291 --> 00:31:00,920
It's Google here. So,
um, it's a new inventive,

533
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,150
a news platform which evolves generally's
him in a way that has never been done

534
00:31:05,151 --> 00:31:10,151
before by bringing together a Wiki
based community of volunteers and hired

535
00:31:10,791 --> 00:31:15,790
professional journalist in an effort
to create a collaborative new space and

536
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:17,660
high quality open platform,

537
00:31:17,661 --> 00:31:20,900
which is genuinely community
controlled and have the bay,

538
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:24,380
the backbone of professional journalists.
And so we practically,

539
00:31:24,381 --> 00:31:29,381
I attend the community volunteers and the
hire journalists as equals and it is a

540
00:31:30,141 --> 00:31:34,160
wiki based platform so everyone can
edit every article on our website.

541
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:39,800
So, um, but how do you
ensure freedom of expression?

542
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:43,160
And this is not just,
this isn't just journalists,

543
00:31:43,161 --> 00:31:47,690
these are individuals who are today
posting to social media. First of all,

544
00:31:47,691 --> 00:31:51,440
what do we need to protect
them from? Yeah, so I think
we ensure expression. Yeah.

545
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:53,930
One thing I wanted to explain because
there was a little error in the

546
00:31:53,931 --> 00:31:57,950
introduction in 2015,
uh,

547
00:31:57,951 --> 00:31:59,510
I didn't set up the Wikipedia foundation.

548
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:02,630
The Wikimedia foundation has been
around for a long time. In 2015,

549
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:07,040
I set up the Jimmy Wales, uh, Jimmy Lewis
Foundation for freedom of expression,

550
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:11,210
which is a nonprofit based in the UK.
When what we do is we,

551
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:16,510
we fight for mainly for social media
users, so people who aren't covered.

552
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:20,630
So reporters without borders does a
fantastic job of working to a highlight

553
00:32:20,631 --> 00:32:22,190
cases of journalists being arrested.

554
00:32:22,191 --> 00:32:26,330
But a lot of times ordinary people who
say something and get themselves arrested,

555
00:32:26,331 --> 00:32:28,310
a political speech to get a bit ignored.

556
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:32,240
And so we try to campaign for those
people and so forth. And we'll re uh,

557
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:36,590
is the CEO of the Jimmy Wales Foundation.
Uh, and that's a separate piece of work,

558
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,110
uh, from Wiki attribute, which is a
project. Uh, Jimmy was foundation that,

559
00:32:41,111 --> 00:32:45,800
that what happened there,
I went to Dubai, uh,

560
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:50,690
to give a speech as I do. And when I
landed they said, oh, congratulations. Uh,

561
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,440
the leader of Dubai has decided to give
you a half a million dollars as the

562
00:32:54,441 --> 00:32:59,300
knowledge award. Uh, and I was like,
okay, fine. It sounds all right.

563
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:02,160
But then I went back to my room
and I was like, you know, I'm,

564
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:06,680
I'm like super critical of
Dubai on human rights issues,

565
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,840
a freedom of expression and so forth,

566
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:13,010
so I can't in good conscience take
this money and buy a boat. Um,

567
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:16,400
and so that was when I said,
okay, I'm going to take the money,

568
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:19,100
which is from a bad source in my opinion.

569
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:21,920
I don't want to give it back
to him so he can, you know,

570
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:24,710
hire more people to beat bloggers.
Um,

571
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:26,900
instead I'll use it to fight
for freedom of expression.

572
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,210
So that's when we started
working together on that. Um,

573
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:33,320
and so that's been great fun. Okay.
So then explain Wiki Tribune please.

574
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:38,540
All so we can Tribune. Uh, so we
contribute and we just started this year,

575
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:43,830
uh, or you get the basic concept of
it. A little of the history. We, um,

576
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,650
we decided to launch using
a crowdfunding campaign. Uh,

577
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:51,200
and I really am a big fan of
crowd funding as you know, as a,

578
00:33:51,201 --> 00:33:54,190
as an entrepreneur starting something new.
Um,

579
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,500
I could have easily gone in and raise
money in silicon valley to do it,

580
00:33:57,501 --> 00:34:00,170
but I don't know if the public
is interested. Do they want this?

581
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,100
And so saying to people, Hey, will
you sign up to contribute? Uh,

582
00:34:04,101 --> 00:34:06,980
and the business model is, um, we,

583
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:10,070
we asked people to become
monthly supporters. Uh,

584
00:34:10,071 --> 00:34:14,270
we have no paywall and no advertising.
So a series of bad business decisions,

585
00:34:14,271 --> 00:34:18,920
but it's how I built my
career so far. Um, and, uh,

586
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:21,800
but I didn't know. I'm like, well, that
even work when people would be interested.

587
00:34:21,801 --> 00:34:24,770
So we did a crowdfunding campaign,
not on Kickstarter or anywhere like that.

588
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:28,070
We just did it sort of independently. Um,
and we've got a great, you know, I said,

589
00:34:28,071 --> 00:34:31,070
look, I need enough money to hard 10
journalists, uh, had some tech people.

590
00:34:31,071 --> 00:34:36,050
And so we managed to do that. Uh, we
also got a, a lovely grant from Google,

591
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,640
Google Digital News Initiative in
Europe, uh, to develop the software. Uh,

592
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,020
we've got,
we're using,

593
00:34:42,021 --> 00:34:45,170
we're taking wordpress as a platform
and turning it into a Wiki. And it,

594
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,150
as it turns out,
wordpress doesn't want to be a Wiki a.

595
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:52,300
So there's a lot of eating on it
to make that, uh, more, uh, uh,

596
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:55,070
useful in that regard.
Um,

597
00:34:55,340 --> 00:35:00,340
and we went into like closed
Beta for a while and then now,

598
00:35:01,581 --> 00:35:02,960
just two weeks ago we've opened,

599
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:05,630
you can go and sign up and
you can start editing things.

600
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:09,380
And we've got now 13 journalists hired,
some of them are part time,

601
00:35:09,381 --> 00:35:13,910
but 10 full time equivalents, um,
around the world, but mostly in London,

602
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:16,370
which is where I live. And
that's, that's where we are today.

603
00:35:16,371 --> 00:35:18,920
And we were publishing stories. So go
to, we contributed and you can see it.

604
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:24,130
So what is just for this group to
understand what is the problem that Wiki

605
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:30,440
Tribune solves versus what we can meet?
We compete. We can pdf death today. Yeah.

606
00:35:30,441 --> 00:35:35,210
So, um, so Wikipedia is not news.
There's a page and Wikipedia,

607
00:35:35,211 --> 00:35:37,170
this is not news. We're
not news. Now, of course,

608
00:35:37,171 --> 00:35:41,010
Wikipedia quite famously does update
very quickly when news events happen.

609
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:46,050
But it doesn't cover every single thing
as it's happening. And also in Wikipedia,

610
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:50,010
uh, one of the fundamental
rules is no original research.

611
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,850
And so everything in Wikipedia should
have been published in a high quality

612
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:56,550
third party source.
But to do journalism,

613
00:35:56,551 --> 00:35:58,950
journalism by definition
is original research. Um,

614
00:35:58,951 --> 00:36:02,480
it's actually going out and getting
new stories, new information. What,

615
00:36:02,481 --> 00:36:07,380
what I'm hopeful for. And the, and the
concept behind this is to say, look,

616
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:12,680
if we can find a way for a community to
usefully and productively help out, uh,

617
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:16,320
with the process of journalism,
it lowers the cost significantly.

618
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,300
And by lowering the cost significantly,

619
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,890
that means of the money
we get from readers,

620
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,280
more of it can be spent on
journalists. Um, you know,

621
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:27,030
if I was on the board of the Guardian
and the Guardian has lots and lots of

622
00:36:27,031 --> 00:36:28,350
journalists,
it's a fantastic paper,

623
00:36:28,351 --> 00:36:31,980
but they've got a lot of people doing
things inside the Guardian that I know

624
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:33,600
people would enjoy doing themselves.

625
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:37,850
There's no reason to pay
staff to do something that
people would enjoy doing, um,

626
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:42,060
if they're invited to do it. And one
of those things, uh, for example,

627
00:36:42,061 --> 00:36:45,030
is policing for neutrality,

628
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:50,130
which is something that most newspapers
these days are very, very bad at.

629
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:54,210
Um, so explain to you, what do you
mean by neutrality? Neutrality?

630
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:58,350
Well,
you're familiar with it from Wikipedia.

631
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:02,790
A Wikipedia tries very hard
to be quite neutral, um,

632
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:07,190
and succeeds for the most part. And, uh,

633
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:10,170
most media outlets these
days don't even try.

634
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:14,130
I mean a few do good quality
papers, still try to be neutral. Um,

635
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:18,110
and I think if we think of
neutrality, I mean we, we had, uh,

636
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:22,530
we've been criticized on the neutrality
front from both the right and the left

637
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,290
applicant reviewed already. So, uh,

638
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:28,800
Breitbart had a really nasty article
about a weekend should be in.

639
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:29,700
And I was like,
great.

640
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,790
They're not living up to their standard
of nutrient and living to Breitbart

641
00:37:32,791 --> 00:37:33,930
standard of neutrality.
No.

642
00:37:33,931 --> 00:37:37,060
It basically saying we're obviously
a bunch of lefties and so on. Uh,

643
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,760
and then when I left
wing journalists saying,

644
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:43,020
obviously there's no such
thing as truth, so, um,

645
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:45,330
I'm exaggerating, but, uh,

646
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,600
but basically everybody that the simple
way to understand it philosophically is

647
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:51,450
everybody knows what bias looks like.
You know,

648
00:37:51,451 --> 00:37:55,250
if we mentioned Breitbart and neutrality,
the same sentence, we all chuckle a,

649
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:57,480
because we know they don't
even try to be neutral.

650
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:02,040
Same with the Daily Mail for example. Um,
and frankly the same with the Guardian.

651
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:04,400
I love the Guardian, but they're,
they're not a neutral newspaper.

652
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:09,180
They come from a particular
liberal position. Um, and
the idea is to say, look,

653
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:13,800
actually you should try to just report
the facts in a very neutral manner and

654
00:38:13,801 --> 00:38:17,160
it's important to really truck will
you get there perfectly. Of course not,

655
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:17,994
not every time,

656
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:23,180
but one of the ways that you can get there
is if you do have a healthy community

657
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,520
who aren't just people screaming
at each other who are saying, yeah,

658
00:38:26,521 --> 00:38:30,470
actually we've got some diversity in the
community to make sure that, you know,

659
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,240
we're not just focusing
on one side of the issue.

660
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:36,490
We're actually taking into account
the best arguments of the other side,

661
00:38:36,491 --> 00:38:37,324
et Cetera,
et cetera.

662
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:41,590
So please get your questions ready.
I have one more question for Jimmy and,

663
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:46,180
or a read and then, um, and then
we'll open it up. So, um, you,

664
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:51,190
there are 3000 people in the Wikipedia
world who are probably the most important

665
00:38:51,431 --> 00:38:52,930
and they're the important for everybody.

666
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,270
There's also us and they're
known to each other.

667
00:38:55,271 --> 00:38:59,860
There's also a set of people in the
world who are maybe equally or more

668
00:38:59,861 --> 00:39:03,010
important in those are the people
who create the algorithm for Google.

669
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:08,550
What should Google takeaway from what
you've been able to accomplish and the way

670
00:39:08,591 --> 00:39:11,350
you see the world going forward
in terms of information?

671
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:16,670
Oh, I don't know. I mean, that's a really,

672
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:18,590
it's a really tough problem.
I mean,

673
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:25,130
so one of the things that I
think, I dunno, I have no idea.

674
00:39:25,131 --> 00:39:26,810
That's a really tough
question. I, I'll just,

675
00:39:26,811 --> 00:39:31,370
I'll comment in a somewhere near that.
So I was part of a group,

676
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,600
um, that Google asks to
help and be advising, uh,

677
00:39:35,601 --> 00:39:40,490
about the right to be forgotten in Europe,
which was a huge deal in Europe.

678
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,040
This is a written out,
we're working together sort of a,

679
00:39:43,041 --> 00:39:45,980
she was helping me write
stuff for Google and so forth.

680
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:51,390
And the issue there is that,
uh, in Europe, the, the,

681
00:39:51,391 --> 00:39:54,980
the state of the law isn't, is really,
it's a disaster for freedom of expression.

682
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,210
Um, it's really not, not appropriate. Uh,

683
00:39:58,211 --> 00:40:01,250
and the problem is the law that has been
applied by the courts is actually older

684
00:40:01,251 --> 00:40:03,810
than Google. Um, the, the,

685
00:40:03,811 --> 00:40:08,811
the particular case that went through was
a lawyer in Spain had had some sort of

686
00:40:09,861 --> 00:40:14,861
a tax problem and his house had been
taken from him and had to be auctioned and

687
00:40:15,681 --> 00:40:17,260
he,
and this was covered in the papers.

688
00:40:17,261 --> 00:40:20,270
It was actually an official notice
from the courts that was in the,

689
00:40:20,271 --> 00:40:22,700
in the papers.
It's still published in that paper,

690
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:25,510
but Google is not allowed to link to it,
um,

691
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:29,600
on the grounds that it's out of date,
irrelevant, et cetera. Not, to me,

692
00:40:29,601 --> 00:40:30,950
that's not irrelevant at all.

693
00:40:30,951 --> 00:40:34,280
If my lawyer has at his
house taken for tax reasons,

694
00:40:34,281 --> 00:40:38,150
that's probably important thing about,
no. Uh, but so there you have it. So it's,

695
00:40:38,151 --> 00:40:40,070
it's,
it's really a bad thing,

696
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:44,450
but there are other cases where you
can be a little more sympathetic, uh,

697
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:48,070
you know, some, um, revenge porn, uh,

698
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:52,700
things like that where if
Google is linking to it, that's
it's problematic. No, my,

699
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:57,760
my belief is that any demand to take down
content or a link to content should go

700
00:40:57,981 --> 00:41:02,000
through a judge. Uh, it
shouldn't be the way it is now.

701
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:06,680
Google is mandated to be judge, jury,
and executioner on these things.

702
00:41:06,681 --> 00:41:07,730
And there's not,
for publishers,

703
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:11,030
there's not a really clear right of
appeal and Google's shouldn't have that

704
00:41:11,031 --> 00:41:12,380
responsibility.
And Google,

705
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:16,070
I think takes it seriously to try to
do the right thing, but it's just not,

706
00:41:16,071 --> 00:41:20,420
the public policy was, is not the right
answer. But one of the things I said to,

707
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:24,320
uh, to Eric Schmidt when we were going
around and doing this, as I said, I,

708
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:25,430
we were doing hearings around,

709
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,430
you're hearing from all kinds of experts
on all sides of the issues. I said,

710
00:41:28,431 --> 00:41:32,960
I wish we were doing these hearings two
years ago before it became a legal court

711
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:38,000
because I actually think this is a
search quality issue that for Google you

712
00:41:38,001 --> 00:41:41,720
don't really want to be linking to
revenge porn and you really want to have a

713
00:41:41,721 --> 00:41:44,870
well understood and well
developed editorial policy.

714
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:49,570
And of course Google traditionally has
kind of been a little reluctant to,

715
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:53,720
to say we choose to link to
things we think are quality,

716
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:56,360
where like the New York Times,
we have a right of freedom of expression.

717
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:59,760
Instead Google has preferred
to go. It's the algorithm. Uh,

718
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:03,370
and I think that may have been, I'm not
a lawyer, so I don't know, you know,

719
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:04,790
why that approach was taken.

720
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:08,750
I think it may have been a mistake because
I do think for a lot of the kinds of

721
00:42:08,751 --> 00:42:12,500
things that Google is linking
to or shouldn't be linking to,

722
00:42:12,501 --> 00:42:15,920
rather than having the law
dictated most of, most of the time,

723
00:42:15,921 --> 00:42:19,430
I think Google should just make
those decisions to say, yeah,

724
00:42:19,431 --> 00:42:20,780
we're not going to link to revenge porn.

725
00:42:20,781 --> 00:42:23,630
So if there's a revenge porn link
out there and we're notified,

726
00:42:23,631 --> 00:42:26,390
we're going to take that link down,
which I think they do now. But great.

727
00:42:26,391 --> 00:42:31,190
Well this is a good transition
to questions. Uh, if you,

728
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,870
if your questions, there are two
microphones on either side and since, uh,

729
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:40,760
since we need to to this to
go on video, um, questions,

730
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:43,400
does anybody have questions? Yes, please.

731
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:43,830
Hi.

732
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:47,370
I was wondering what the relationship was
between a Wiki Tribune and Wikipedia'd

733
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,710
or what the intended goal relationship is.

734
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:54,810
Yeah, so we can do view it as a completely
new organization and there is no

735
00:42:54,811 --> 00:42:59,580
relationship at all. Uh, I'm on
the board of both, but that's it.

736
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:01,620
And the reason I did it that way,

737
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:06,480
it's one of the things that's fantastic
about the world of Wikipedia, uh,

738
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:10,950
is that all decisions get made through
a very long process of community

739
00:43:10,951 --> 00:43:14,130
consultation and deliberation,

740
00:43:14,131 --> 00:43:16,710
which means we're very
slow and making decisions,

741
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:19,330
but we tend to make very good decisions.
Uh,

742
00:43:19,331 --> 00:43:22,680
this is a startup where I'm going to
have to change the website like 10 times

743
00:43:22,681 --> 00:43:25,110
quite radically as we figure
out what's working, what isn't.

744
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:28,320
And it wasn't really possible to
even launch something like this.

745
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:31,800
It'd be a massive sort of two year
consultation and I wanted to just move

746
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:35,940
quickly. So that's what we're
doing it this way. Other questions

747
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,780
and Jimmy are both, thanks very much
for an interesting conversation. Um,

748
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:43,550
you mentioned that when you were,

749
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:47,090
you live in London and I think
the foundation is based in the UK.

750
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:52,450
The UK also has famously restrictive
and gruesome libel laws that massively

751
00:43:53,001 --> 00:43:54,350
restrict freedom of expression.

752
00:43:54,351 --> 00:43:57,130
Is there any kind of risk for the
foundation for that or is this,

753
00:43:57,131 --> 00:43:59,690
I'm going to irony in there
to basically right there.

754
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:03,590
Okay. So the Jimmy Wells
Foundation is based in the UK,

755
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:05,160
a completely separate organization.

756
00:44:05,161 --> 00:44:08,910
And we get to have too many organizations
we contribute is based in the UK. Uh,

757
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:13,100
and then the Wikimedia foundation, which
runs Wikipedia is in California. Um,

758
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,550
so on the,
on the libel law front for Wiki Tribune,

759
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,080
the law has changed recently in the
UK. Uh, it's become a lot better,

760
00:44:21,081 --> 00:44:26,081
but it's still by no means
as good as a in the US.

761
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:29,080
Uh,
but I,

762
00:44:29,081 --> 00:44:32,940
I'm not that worried about it because
we want to be really like very high

763
00:44:32,941 --> 00:44:35,370
quality, very neutral, very fact based.

764
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:39,690
Obviously there's always a risk
of a lawsuit of course. Uh,

765
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:43,500
but if the daily mail can survive
without being sued out of existence,

766
00:44:43,501 --> 00:44:44,640
I imagine we'll be all right.

767
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:48,743
Right here please.

768
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:54,780
What's your plans for a scope and scale
of the first year? How many stories,

769
00:44:54,781 --> 00:44:56,770
like on an average day
would you want to happen?

770
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:01,120
Wiki Trivia, um, don't really know. Uh,

771
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:04,730
we want to have just as much as possible,
but without compromising quality.

772
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,190
So there are a lot of
interesting open question.

773
00:45:07,191 --> 00:45:10,400
So right now because we've just launched,
um,

774
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:15,170
basically what we say is that the
community and the staff are equals,

775
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,420
but that doesn't mean that everybody
is the editor in chief. Um,

776
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:22,370
and so we do have editors who approve
things before they're published and they

777
00:45:22,371 --> 00:45:24,680
treat the journalists and the
staff is equal in that regard.

778
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:27,740
So right now we're being a little bit
slow about what we're putting out because

779
00:45:27,741 --> 00:45:32,060
we want it to be good quality. Part of
that is I wouldn't do it this way if,

780
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:35,300
if I weren't a well known personal ready,

781
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:39,860
but I know that a lot of people
who at the Daily Mail for example,

782
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:43,550
are just waiting for us to publish some
error to just sort of take us down a

783
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:47,720
notch and we'd rather be battered,
held to high standard from day one.

784
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:51,600
Whereas Wikipedia was not held to
high standard from day one, uh,

785
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,650
because nobody knew what we were doing.
Nobody cared.

786
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:56,990
They were like very tiny little group
of people on an obscure corner of the

787
00:45:56,991 --> 00:45:59,030
Internet.
Eventually though,

788
00:45:59,031 --> 00:46:02,390
I think we want to open it up to
have stories published quite quickly.

789
00:46:02,391 --> 00:46:03,530
A lot of open ended things.

790
00:46:03,531 --> 00:46:07,850
I'm happy to have short little stub
articles that are just like quick updates

791
00:46:07,851 --> 00:46:11,810
rather than a fully composed piece. So,
but to be determined to be determined.

792
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:13,190
So I'm going to take another one here.

793
00:46:13,191 --> 00:46:15,740
We have two more here and I just want to
make sure everyone gets their questions

794
00:46:15,741 --> 00:46:17,540
answered because we're
going to run at a time.

795
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:18,521
Hey Jimmy.

796
00:46:18,521 --> 00:46:21,790
I used to do some work on the Wikipedia
signposts and I was wondering to what

797
00:46:21,791 --> 00:46:25,490
extent that may have influenced Wiki
Tribune, that Wikipedia signposts as,

798
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:25,931
I don't know,

799
00:46:25,931 --> 00:46:30,640
when is say an on Wikipedia
sort of newspaper that's
been around for at least a

800
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,990
decade,
probably a decade and a half.

801
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:37,380
Um, to some extent. Yeah.
Because it's uh, uh,

802
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,830
I mean obviously I read the signpost,
uh,

803
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:43,950
and sort of goes into my thinking about
what communities can do a and the sign

804
00:46:43,951 --> 00:46:45,780
posts generally,
uh,

805
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:50,160
generally or reports on internal goings
on at Wikipedia as well as things that

806
00:46:50,161 --> 00:46:53,550
would be of interest to the community
outside and tries to be neutral and fair

807
00:46:53,551 --> 00:46:58,410
and so on. And I think it's quite good.
Uh, I can't say it directly inspired me,

808
00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:03,270
but honestly it's just a part
of my world yet. Here please.

809
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:06,530
Hi. So I'd like to go back on
fact checking in on Wikipedia.

810
00:47:06,531 --> 00:47:07,730
If you could comment a bit more,

811
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:11,390
what happens when somebody
added sort of obscure,

812
00:47:11,391 --> 00:47:14,810
difficult to check facts?
Like, uh, for example,

813
00:47:14,811 --> 00:47:18,140
you have census data for some
small county in us let's say,

814
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:23,410
which is not easy to check and
maybe does that trigger a signal,

815
00:47:23,541 --> 00:47:28,541
an email to the moderators or do you
have a minimum amount of edits that are

816
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:32,620
needed be done before that triggers an
alert that perhaps somebody is making

817
00:47:32,621 --> 00:47:34,870
significant changes? Um, you know,

818
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:39,050
I specifically liked on the same how you
check the numbers because I use that to

819
00:47:39,051 --> 00:47:39,884
my project.

820
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:41,160
Yeah.
Um,

821
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:46,280
so generally there's not much
algorithmic signaling of people. Um,

822
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:50,450
so editors have a watch list and they can
flag the things that are interested to

823
00:47:50,451 --> 00:47:52,730
watch and then they're notified
when something changes there.

824
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:55,730
Normally what we would say is
we will ask for the source.

825
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,720
So then you have to link to the
source and then you know, it,

826
00:47:58,721 --> 00:48:00,140
it may be hard to find the source,

827
00:48:00,141 --> 00:48:02,270
but once you found the
source and you link to it,

828
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:04,880
it's quite easy for other people
that go and evaluate it and say, oh,

829
00:48:04,881 --> 00:48:09,620
well this is from, uh, the
government of this area.

830
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,630
Uh,
it was published at the state.

831
00:48:11,631 --> 00:48:13,730
It seems like legitimate
formation and that sort of thing.

832
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:15,830
It's quite old fashioned,
really. There's nothing,

833
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:18,650
sometimes these resources
aren't online though. So like,

834
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:23,090
since was data from the 18 hundreds? Yeah.
Yeah. So for sources that aren't online,

835
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:27,620
uh, we consider that to be valid.
Uh, there's, there's no rule there.

836
00:48:27,621 --> 00:48:31,370
I actually sometimes get caught in,
I find it incredibly annoying. Uh,

837
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:35,480
I get quoted and people love to make
like these beautiful kind of pluck cards

838
00:48:35,481 --> 00:48:40,460
with this quote saying, if it isn't
in Google, it doesn't exist. Um, okay.

839
00:48:40,461 --> 00:48:44,450
Those words came out of my mouth only to
make fun of that view of the world. Uh,

840
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:49,010
and so I'm like, that's not really
fair to quote me as saying that. Um,

841
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:52,990
so it's basically the,
um,

842
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:57,710
uh, it's, it's, it's, there's
no, nothing special, no nothing.

843
00:48:57,711 --> 00:48:59,270
I can really tell you if,

844
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:02,150
if you're a well known contributor and
you're known to be someone who works in

845
00:49:02,151 --> 00:49:03,650
that area and you're
trusted by the community,

846
00:49:03,651 --> 00:49:08,390
that would be completely accepted if the
information you're putting in seams in

847
00:49:08,391 --> 00:49:13,390
some way. Surprising. So you're,
you're saying the population of uh,

848
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:18,200
uh, Miami, Florida was 43
million people in 1870,

849
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:23,030
we'd probably go, yeah, probably not. And
challenge it. Um, and then in between,

850
00:49:23,031 --> 00:49:24,940
I think we would tend to
trust if it's obscured,

851
00:49:24,941 --> 00:49:27,950
like what motive would you have
for making up population numbers?

852
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:32,820
That's a question that we go through
people's minds and the, the source there,

853
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:37,830
there will be people in Wikipedia who
their hobby is population figures in the

854
00:49:37,971 --> 00:49:38,804
18 hundreds,

855
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:42,560
and they will have some idea as to
whether it corroborates with the General

856
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:45,990
Dadada nothing magical about it.
Um,

857
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:48,470
it's just trying to do
the best job we can.

858
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,620
Kids or I want to just get your
through the rest of the questions.

859
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:53,270
Please go ahead and trying to throw.

860
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:55,220
So this relates to the
previous question on scope,

861
00:49:55,670 --> 00:50:00,110
but it's a good way in which news source
success bias is not only the two of the

862
00:50:00,111 --> 00:50:00,890
articles,

863
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:03,890
but also which stories that she used to
cover and what prominence they choose to

864
00:50:03,891 --> 00:50:04,700
assign them.

865
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:07,280
So is there any way that would get your
billing plans to address this issue?

866
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:08,960
I think this is,

867
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:13,310
this is where having a healthy on
diverse community is very helpful.

868
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:18,020
Um, because community members can
start stories about anything they want.

869
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:23,360
And so the problem of a small team of
an editorial board who have a certain

870
00:50:23,361 --> 00:50:26,990
perspective on the world, even if they're
trying to be neutral, obviously one the,

871
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:29,450
you know,
one of the facts about biases,

872
00:50:29,451 --> 00:50:34,340
oftentimes we are biased in ways that
we don't even notice because that's what

873
00:50:34,341 --> 00:50:38,450
bias is. Right? Um, and so having
a diverse community who says, hey,

874
00:50:38,451 --> 00:50:39,500
we need to write about this.

875
00:50:39,501 --> 00:50:42,200
This is an important story that's
not being covered elsewhere.

876
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:45,680
And they couldn't rally volunteers
to do that, then then they should.

877
00:50:45,681 --> 00:50:47,930
And I think we have to
be very introspective,

878
00:50:47,931 --> 00:50:51,350
always about our internal
staff processes to say,

879
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:54,560
are we just choosing
stories? Um, you know,

880
00:50:54,561 --> 00:50:56,810
so like in today's political environment,

881
00:50:57,170 --> 00:51:02,170
you might only choose stories about Donald
Trump and Russia and not true stories

882
00:51:02,241 --> 00:51:06,340
about Hillary and her emails. That's
just one simple example, which is,

883
00:51:06,341 --> 00:51:08,270
I know what you've always got to
challenge yourself and say, right,

884
00:51:08,271 --> 00:51:10,490
we need to make sure we're looking
at things. It's actually one of the,

885
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:15,140
I have a whole little rant about Fox
News and I haven't lived in the u s in a

886
00:51:15,141 --> 00:51:19,400
long time, uh, for eight
years. And even before that,

887
00:51:19,401 --> 00:51:22,130
I wasn't a big watcher of Fox News
because I don't watch much television.

888
00:51:22,131 --> 00:51:26,210
But one of the things I think a lot of
people missed when they thought Fox News

889
00:51:26,211 --> 00:51:29,120
was incredibly biased,
which of course it is in certain ways,

890
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:30,980
is most of the shows people talked about.

891
00:51:30,981 --> 00:51:34,280
Our opinion shows it's bill O'Reilly
pontificating and having guests in,

892
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:38,540
but they're straight news segments.
Uh, we're actually quite high quality,

893
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:43,580
but they often covered stories that
people in the heartland cared about.

894
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:47,720
The people in New York and California
weren't that interested in and that was

895
00:51:47,721 --> 00:51:51,150
one of the reasons they became very
popular. They would cover a story, uh,

896
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:55,250
that just seemed like, you know, whatever
factory workers out of work somewhere,

897
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,200
you know,
maybe we near comes covers it.

898
00:51:57,201 --> 00:51:58,760
But they were like
really in there in a way.

899
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:02,540
And I think that's important is one of
the reasons I think we've had this huge

900
00:52:02,541 --> 00:52:06,500
drop in trust in the media
is a lot of people read,

901
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:08,780
followed immediate and they're
like, well, this, I don't know,

902
00:52:08,781 --> 00:52:11,660
this has nothing to do with my life.
Nobody's really covering it.

903
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:16,720
And when we look at the
incredible devastation has
happened to local newspapers

904
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:20,810
everywhere, you can actually
see why people feel like, Hey,

905
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:23,780
journalism doesn't care about me.
They're basically,

906
00:52:23,781 --> 00:52:27,620
all they do is rant about Trump. Nobody's
like concerned about our problems here.

907
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:32,660
Um, so I, I'm, we have like
two speed dating questions.

908
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:36,110
So let's take the two questions here
and if we can, we'll just take one more.

909
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:39,680
I'm really concerned about time.
They're, they're starting to like,

910
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:44,690
I would love to, yes. Every question.
Like they say Jimmy. No, no, no.

911
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:50,180
[inaudible] and thank you. Thank you.
This question is for four week explicitly.

912
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:50,900
Um,

913
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:55,250
it seems to me part of the success of
Wikipedia is the quality of the community.

914
00:52:55,560 --> 00:53:00,560
How are you going about building
the community and making sure it is?

915
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:02,963
Thank you.

916
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:05,100
And so first of all,

917
00:53:05,101 --> 00:53:08,430
and we're welcoming everyone
and we're welcoming all of you.

918
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:13,610
And we're lucky to have Jamie to have
experience of building an online community

919
00:53:15,091 --> 00:53:16,140
of contributors.

920
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:21,270
So we are also aware of all their
possible problems that might occur.

921
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:26,570
We don't want it to be UK based
or US based or you're just,

922
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:29,100
you know,
West centric.

923
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:33,330
And that's why we plan to launch in as
many languages as possible in as many

924
00:53:33,331 --> 00:53:37,410
regions as possible to start
dissolving. You know, they're all,

925
00:53:37,411 --> 00:53:41,080
I'm focused on, on, on, you know,

926
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,230
you were talking about Trump and Hillary.

927
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:46,420
There are so many more stories around
the world were happening. You know,

928
00:53:46,421 --> 00:53:51,421
we have Tara taxing Egypt and so on
that people do talk about maybe an oddly

929
00:53:51,571 --> 00:53:52,980
enough maybe you know,

930
00:53:52,981 --> 00:53:57,060
a lot of corruptions in different new on
Columbia in different countries that I

931
00:53:57,061 --> 00:53:58,950
don't think they get enough focus.

932
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:03,040
That's why am personally I have the
background, a few in rights law.

933
00:54:03,041 --> 00:54:08,041
So personally I'm very interested in
having a very diverse community and from

934
00:54:10,201 --> 00:54:14,400
big different background for
gender, you know, gender wise,

935
00:54:14,401 --> 00:54:19,240
I know that Wikipedia has some
problem with not enough women, um,

936
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:21,750
editing the entries.

937
00:54:21,751 --> 00:54:26,320
So we are very aware of the
palms that war or still existing,

938
00:54:26,321 --> 00:54:30,240
they Wikipedia and we're trying to avoid
them or sold them before they happened.

939
00:54:30,241 --> 00:54:33,810
And,
and so it is a challenge.

940
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:37,580
Of course I don't have all
the answers yet, but um, we,

941
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:42,670
we can adopt some of the solutions that
were already farmed in Wikipedia and

942
00:54:42,721 --> 00:54:45,180
maybe we will find new once a diversity.

943
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:50,010
I think it's a very important for the
neutrality part of Jimmy spoke about a,

944
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:53,270
but for many more things,
um,

945
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:58,510
that are important for very
sustainable use side. That's going to,

946
00:54:58,790 --> 00:55:03,210
and I turned all issues and relate
to as many people as possible.

947
00:55:03,211 --> 00:55:07,290
We want to change journalists and we don't
want to replicate what already exists.

948
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:08,183
Yeah.

949
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:11,070
So we're going to,
I know I'm running over time,

950
00:55:11,071 --> 00:55:12,450
they're going to like get the hook soon,

951
00:55:12,451 --> 00:55:16,200
but I want to make sure we get out the
answers. Questions. Amazing. Duck sweater.

952
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:17,213
Please go ahead.

953
00:55:17,870 --> 00:55:20,780
So I guess bringing it back
to a Wikipedia question,

954
00:55:20,781 --> 00:55:23,810
you've mentioned how important
the community is and you
kind of just mentioned

955
00:55:23,811 --> 00:55:28,400
some of the maybe biases or
differences about that. Um,

956
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:30,020
a specific question I had is,

957
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:34,040
do you think that the
community of contributors is
going to be aging over time

958
00:55:34,041 --> 00:55:36,770
with Wikipedia or are you
seeing a lot of kind of newer,

959
00:55:36,771 --> 00:55:39,060
younger people come in common?

960
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:42,290
I guess if you have any insight into other
trials of any kind of diversity there?

961
00:55:42,830 --> 00:55:47,530
Yeah, in terms of Wikipedia,
the, uh, the, it's a,

962
00:55:47,531 --> 00:55:52,330
it's a concern, but it's not
an overwhelming concern. So
we do see, we've got a, uh,

963
00:55:52,331 --> 00:55:55,390
a very large cohort of very active,

964
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:58,870
very powerful users who've been
around for a long time. Uh,

965
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:01,850
but we also have new contributors
would come in all the time. Uh,

966
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,240
if we don't have good data on the aging.

967
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:09,190
My feeling is that the Wikipedia
community has been aging. Uh,

968
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:13,210
sort of the average age has been going
up about a quarter of a year every year

969
00:56:13,211 --> 00:56:16,840
or something like that. Uh, so we are
aging, but it's not like we're all,

970
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:21,220
we're not going up by one year per
year. Uh, so there is that. Um,

971
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:26,920
and yeah, final question please. Yeah.

972
00:56:26,921 --> 00:56:30,780
So my question is just around,
uh, she can use and you know,

973
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,820
large by the fake news problem is
that people are just consuming news,

974
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:34,571
an echo chamber.

975
00:56:34,571 --> 00:56:39,080
So I'm just curious about how Wiki
Tribune plants to tackle that and any

976
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:40,510
thoughts you have right now.
Yes,

977
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:42,100
I think I was just talking about that,

978
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:45,780
that we are going to
attend to more communities.

979
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:49,190
It also going to local
communities as well. Uh,

980
00:56:49,191 --> 00:56:53,660
we're searching for a lot of models
to get as many diverse people and

981
00:56:53,661 --> 00:56:55,970
communities and backgrounds and involved.

982
00:56:56,530 --> 00:56:59,080
Yeah. I think one of the,
one of the key elements here,

983
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:02,960
one of the reasons we're
launching with no ads is like the,

984
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:07,690
the advertising model drives a certain
sameness to the stories that are covered.

985
00:57:07,691 --> 00:57:09,100
If you're chasing clicks,

986
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:12,310
you need to have a headline about
something that people are already excited

987
00:57:12,311 --> 00:57:15,340
about and know about.
So you're going to get a lot more clicks.

988
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:17,080
Our business model,
what I need,

989
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:19,780
I need you to read to the
bottom of a piece and say, wow,

990
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:24,730
I didn't see that anywhere
else. I understand the world
better than I did before.

991
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:29,290
This deserves to exist. I should ship
in a, I should, I should pay for this.

992
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:34,060
Um, versus if I were at driven,
I just need you to come and look.

993
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:37,990
And that means it doesn't drive you in
the direction of trying to wow people

994
00:57:37,991 --> 00:57:40,930
with like, oh wow, I didn't know
about that. And how did I miss that?

995
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:44,250
This is something new. So I think
that's a part of the answer, uh,

996
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:48,940
is to set up the business model so that
the organization's internal focus is on

997
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:50,860
something different from
what everybody else is doing.

998
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:55,840
So this has been a great conversation
we could go on for a long time,

999
00:57:56,260 --> 00:58:01,120
and, uh, and I'm sure the folks at Google
really appreciate it, so thank you both.

1000
00:58:01,121 --> 00:58:01,954
Yeah.

1001
00:58:03,570 --> 00:58:03,950
Okay.
