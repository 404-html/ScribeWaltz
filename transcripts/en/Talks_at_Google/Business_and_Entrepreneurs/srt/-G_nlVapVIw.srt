1
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,420
[inaudible].

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,540
So today I'm really excited to
have you here to talk a little bit,

3
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:17,990
not just about the coffee, but your path
to getting to where you have today, um,

4
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:23,250
to talk to you guys and to see how Colby
has been able to successfully live a

5
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:27,160
life of work life balance,

6
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,480
doing things that he's passionate about
and really just like having an idea and

7
00:00:31,481 --> 00:00:32,380
going for it.

8
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:37,440
So maybe we just start out talking about
how you decided that you wanted to get

9
00:00:37,601 --> 00:00:38,820
into the business.

10
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,850
Sure. Thank you guys for all coming in.
It's pretty, pretty awesome to be here in

11
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,030
San Francisco at Google serving
coffee to you all. Google is,

12
00:00:50,031 --> 00:00:53,770
um, I'll totally get to what
you said. That's good. Yeah,

13
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:58,410
Google is actually one of our first
back in the day clients actually that a,

14
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:02,290
we ever sold coffee to
kind of, uh, more um,

15
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,850
more big league client out of Santa Cruz.

16
00:01:04,851 --> 00:01:09,560
One of the first people we sold to a was
on the original Google campus. And, uh,

17
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:13,970
our 1950 blend in fact that we sell,

18
00:01:13,971 --> 00:01:16,550
one of our most popular selling blends
was named after the 1950 [inaudible]

19
00:01:16,551 --> 00:01:19,700
building at Google.
So big ups,

20
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:25,280
but it's our trademark. So, uh, um,

21
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,990
but so yeah,

22
00:01:26,991 --> 00:01:31,880
I mean I grew up not really,

23
00:01:31,881 --> 00:01:35,780
I guess in the bay area by then, that
couple of hours north of San Francisco,

24
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,150
uh,
in an area.

25
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:39,743
MMM.

26
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:45,200
Kind of Napa, Mendocino, Lake County,
Sonoma county families from Sonoma county.

27
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:48,140
And I grew up, uh, their farming,

28
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:51,380
Paris in wine grapes and with,
uh,

29
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:57,190
in the old kind of classic farming family
and work a card and then play hard but

30
00:02:00,501 --> 00:02:03,940
mostly work hard. And, um, you know,

31
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,930
my dad went to Uc Davis,

32
00:02:05,931 --> 00:02:10,550
did that whole thing and so kind of was
really instilled in early life about

33
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:16,390
really caring about food and
produce where things come from.

34
00:02:18,021 --> 00:02:19,880
And also seeing really early on how,

35
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:28,740
how there are a lot of people out there
doing amazing work in food and they're

36
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,500
very rarely recognized or
even less rewarded for that.

37
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:37,990
And so that was kind of always on my mind
in this back back burner, um, which we,

38
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,300
I guess we can circle back to.
But uh,

39
00:02:40,301 --> 00:02:42,940
it definitely instilled to me
these kind of core values that,

40
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:47,640
that there's something, there's
something out there that exists for, for,

41
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:52,690
for doing great work in food and
that there was an opportunity there.

42
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:59,080
But um, that more was a
revelation I had later.

43
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:04,230
What kind of really kicked me into just
getting into coffee is the cliche reason

44
00:03:04,241 --> 00:03:07,590
most people get into coffee, which is you
go to college, you go to coffee shops,

45
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:11,650
you hang out there. Cool. You try to
order cool drinks. You usually don't,

46
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,743
you know,
my,

47
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:18,460
my gateway to coffee was
drinking mochas that I hated.

48
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,820
I loved everything about it
except for this espresso taste.

49
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,620
When I was in high school,
I'm trying to go play,

50
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:30,070
I used to play jazz and going and playing
like jazz combos and going to coffee

51
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:33,850
shops and just sort of being
enamored with this coffee house vibe,

52
00:03:33,851 --> 00:03:35,050
this coffee house culture.

53
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,860
Then you go to college and then you end
up studying there and hang out there.

54
00:03:38,861 --> 00:03:41,500
And you find the cool wine and you go
to the one that's cool and not the other

55
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:42,760
ones because it's not cool.

56
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:48,430
And just kind of always in the
back of my mind thought Cliche Lee,

57
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:48,840
you know,

58
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,330
coffee's cool and wouldn't it be cool
someday to do something in coffee?

59
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,220
Didn't more in the back back of the mind.

60
00:03:54,221 --> 00:03:59,221
I went and did other things and studied
environmental science and I did Gis and

61
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,480
did that for like five years and did a
lot of computer stuff and then wanted to

62
00:04:04,481 --> 00:04:08,280
really kind of
do something on my own.

63
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:13,281
Which I guess maybe kind of coming back
to that basis of growing up on a family

64
00:04:13,861 --> 00:04:14,694
farm,

65
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,800
when you're in a family that farms you
don't like clock in for work, you just,

66
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:24,420
it just is life. So I always just
sort of thought I'd work for myself.

67
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,660
And then after five years of
not doing that, I kind of did.

68
00:04:27,661 --> 00:04:32,190
I was like a contractor, but uh, I
really wanted to just start my own

69
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:38,310
business. And so this was while
you were in school? In College?

70
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:42,480
This was right after I finished college
by still the Din the college kind of in

71
00:04:42,481 --> 00:04:47,190
a college town, um, up north Chico. And,

72
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,030
uh,
we're,

73
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:53,030
I ended up living and going to
school and other things and um,

74
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,240
we can get back to those other
things. Yeah, that was cool.

75
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,950
Learned a lot about myself
and um, yeah. Uh, no,

76
00:05:01,951 --> 00:05:04,800
it was great though. I,
it is, it was perfect.

77
00:05:04,801 --> 00:05:07,830
It was a path I was supposed
to be on and but yeah,

78
00:05:07,831 --> 00:05:11,910
getting into wanting to start my own
business and ultimately taking that,

79
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:14,850
that leap. But when, when I
thought like, well, what do I,

80
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,920
what is the business I want to do?

81
00:05:18,921 --> 00:05:21,950
I kind of came back to this thought that
had always been incubating in the back

82
00:05:21,951 --> 00:05:25,550
of my mind that, well, coffee's
cool. Coffee shops are cool.

83
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,170
Yeah.

84
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:30,410
I loved,
I loved music and I just love this.

85
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:34,970
What I thought at that time was how
did very direct tie to coffee houses.

86
00:05:34,971 --> 00:05:36,800
I collect vinyl,
played in bands,

87
00:05:36,801 --> 00:05:41,801
only played analog instruments and
somehow coffee fit in the same strata

88
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,230
as those,
those elements in my life.

89
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,760
And so with out of time
without any experience.

90
00:05:51,761 --> 00:05:56,761
But I went to talk to the guy and the
cool town in the cool coffee shop in town

91
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,070
to ask him,

92
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:03,230
would you mind kind of what does it
take to do this? How do I be great?

93
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,400
What does great look like?

94
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,120
Which is an important lesson I've kind
of tried to always carry with me moving

95
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:11,120
forward. But, and he said, actually, I'm
thinking about selling this coffee house.

96
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,110
Are you interested in buying it?

97
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:16,070
One thing led to another and three
months later I was standing in the coffee

98
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:20,660
shop that I owned with not exactly
understand what to do, understaffed,

99
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,420
um, and really had to just
feel the weight of it,

100
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:30,560
all of what it's like to take that
risk of that commitment and just say,

101
00:06:30,561 --> 00:06:32,120
screw it. Like, let's do this.

102
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,290
So do you feel like it was a,

103
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,400
it was an out of comfort zone
type thing where you're like,

104
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:42,570
I'm in a coffee shop and some of these
presenting this to me and I hadn't

105
00:06:42,571 --> 00:06:45,000
planned on it, but now
you're, this opportunity is,

106
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:49,730
was it an easy decision for you to just
say, Yep, I'm going to do it or no.

107
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,970
How did you feel going into that?

108
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,780
I don't know if it was an easy decision,
but

109
00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:00,320
I kind of have a point of view on certain,

110
00:07:00,321 --> 00:07:02,000
on these things,
which is that,

111
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:03,460
okay,

112
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:07,150
decisions are hard. So sometimes
it's best just to corner yourself,

113
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,290
you know, burn your bridge,
whatever you want to say. But I,

114
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,840
you know, make the commitment
before I, I'm all about analysis.

115
00:07:16,841 --> 00:07:19,720
I wasn't analysis and an
analyst for five years.

116
00:07:19,721 --> 00:07:23,710
So I'm all about analysis and research
is my favorite thing to do in life.

117
00:07:23,711 --> 00:07:24,580
Probably one of them.

118
00:07:24,581 --> 00:07:28,690
But at some point you just jump and you
won't ever have all the information.

119
00:07:28,691 --> 00:07:33,130
And I do believe, uh, uh, saying
that one's Kinda came to me. Um,

120
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:36,250
my sister who was up here was,
can bear witness.

121
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:41,080
And the classic plays where you gather
all life information to make important

122
00:07:41,081 --> 00:07:41,501
decisions,

123
00:07:41,501 --> 00:07:44,920
which is after a prince
concert at a blackjack table
at like two in the morning.

124
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,653
Um,

125
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,710
but I ended up talking to someone who
worked in technology and I guess it built

126
00:07:50,711 --> 00:07:55,680
a pretty successful company and we ended
up talking for a long time and I had

127
00:07:55,681 --> 00:07:56,514
just said,

128
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,420
if you could give some piece of advice
to a young person who's wanting to really

129
00:08:01,421 --> 00:08:04,510
do something special and really get
to maybe in a position like you are,

130
00:08:04,511 --> 00:08:06,490
and not necessarily like,
I don't know if he was wealthy,

131
00:08:06,491 --> 00:08:07,450
I'm pretty sure he might've been,

132
00:08:07,451 --> 00:08:11,860
but just more I could just tell that he
had gotten to some place that he felt

133
00:08:11,861 --> 00:08:15,850
very satisfied with and he just,
without even blinking,

134
00:08:15,851 --> 00:08:19,180
just looked right at me and said,
take chances and over extend yourself.

135
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:21,030
Okay.

136
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:25,560
And that's sort of in my
goto since that night.

137
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:31,430
And in a way it's this permission that
some dude at a blackjack table after

138
00:08:33,241 --> 00:08:34,830
prince concerts gave me.

139
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:39,270
So of course it's valid
and totally trustworthy.

140
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:42,480
I feel like, um, those little
things come into your life.

141
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:45,840
It just different times that reinforce
that you are in the right path and doing

142
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:49,440
the right thing. I mean here you are now
co founder of a global company, right?

143
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,160
Yeah. Yeah. So that's awesome.

144
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,040
Yeah. And I think too, uh, I
mean to answer your question, it,

145
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,750
the decision what,
it wasn't easy,

146
00:09:00,751 --> 00:09:05,070
but just feeling like I
had this permission to make
it and then just jump in,

147
00:09:05,071 --> 00:09:09,210
choosing to jump and set of choosing to,
let's just wait a little bit more.

148
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,240
I'm more of a jumper for better or worse,

149
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:17,160
but I think there is something
to that that, you know,

150
00:09:17,161 --> 00:09:18,810
in life you have to make a lot of choices.

151
00:09:18,811 --> 00:09:23,811
And so I think getting comfortable with
making choices are becoming decisive,

152
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:29,420
knowing that you're knowing you're
for sure not going to be right. Um,

153
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,760
was it the best decision I could've
made my life. I'll never know.

154
00:09:31,761 --> 00:09:36,440
But it was the one I made and it got
me here. It was a stepping stone.

155
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:40,790
So it was definitely a critical decision.
Um,

156
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:45,470
which then led me to my next decision,
which was to start verve with,

157
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:49,430
uh, my business partner,
Ryan. He's over here. Hi Ryan.

158
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,120
He doesn't like being outed,
but

159
00:09:56,090 --> 00:10:00,650
so you had your store in Chico or
you're shopping Chico and what,

160
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:05,420
what was the path then to opening
up your own, your own brand?

161
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,610
Well,
one year into it,

162
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:13,730
after being super understaffed in you
learn a lot when you don't have anyone

163
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:18,443
you can,

164
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,890
when you know that there no one
else's responsibility but yours,

165
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,590
there's no like that. There's no
boss you just, you look for, right.

166
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:28,200
And you realize, shit, I met and
do you just, okay now what do I,

167
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,750
what am I going to do? And you
met, you have to make calls. Um,

168
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,940
a lot of bad decisions,
a lot of great decisions,

169
00:10:32,941 --> 00:10:34,950
but decisions on the less
that move you forward.

170
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:40,520
And I'm learning a lot about having the
right people on the bus and learning

171
00:10:41,521 --> 00:10:44,490
what it's like to have wrong people on
the bus and have to fire people and do

172
00:10:44,491 --> 00:10:47,790
all these things was my first
kind of year in business.

173
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,610
But what came through it
besides the business parts and,

174
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:53,563
okay,

175
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:54,030
yeah.

176
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:59,030
Sales Tax and all these bookkeeping
things that are not my big passion but are

177
00:10:59,461 --> 00:11:01,800
super important.
If you want to run a business,

178
00:11:01,801 --> 00:11:04,260
do not think they're not important.
Uh,

179
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:08,430
hire an accountant before you
hire anybody else. Um, and uh,

180
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:09,930
yeah.

181
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:13,620
Was how much I was falling in love with
coffee because when I got into coffee,

182
00:11:13,621 --> 00:11:16,140
it wasn't for coffee,
it was for a coffee house culture.

183
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:20,520
But after one year into it spending
every day doing it, becoming a Barista,

184
00:11:20,521 --> 00:11:22,980
just and connecting
with a couple of people,

185
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,290
friend Shaun wide who now does flat white,

186
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,840
he's a ceramicist for a
lot of coffee shops around.

187
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,930
He was our first employee at Verve,
um,

188
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:36,180
a few other people and dropping into the
world that became like Barisa culture.

189
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,030
Third wave coffee.
I was,

190
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:44,180
I became completely enamored with
coffee itself and as an analyst and the

191
00:11:45,691 --> 00:11:46,524
researcher,

192
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,020
yeah,

193
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:52,460
this like trapdoor opened and I like
fell through it and it was just the

194
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:54,340
universe of just where
does coffee come from?

195
00:11:54,341 --> 00:11:56,570
Why are some coffees taste different
than others? What's happening?

196
00:11:56,571 --> 00:12:00,040
And what's up with rusty and different
origins, what's up of different varieties.

197
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,650
I have to know everything
about all of this.

198
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,230
And I was thinking about how do I learn,

199
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:09,820
how do I jump in cause I just had this
coffee shop and I thought about my friend

200
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:14,800
from college who I played music with who
had been in coffee it's whole life and

201
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:18,680
was a home roaster and was the biggest
coffee guy knew. And Ryan Donovan,

202
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:21,010
my business partner and we started,

203
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:24,130
I called him one day just from a park
bench in front of a farmer's market and

204
00:12:24,131 --> 00:12:26,290
said, dude, we should start a
coffee roasting company together.

205
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:30,550
He had just moved back from Portland,
uh, work in coffee shops, coffee shops,

206
00:12:30,551 --> 00:12:34,750
coffee roasters, wholesale,
everything. And long story short,

207
00:12:34,751 --> 00:12:37,360
we just met up a few days later,

208
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:42,010
started looking for spots and within a
couple of months we signed a lease and

209
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:46,750
started verve in Santa
Cruz. Yes, in Santa Cruz.

210
00:12:46,751 --> 00:12:51,130
We almost, we originally gonna open in
San Francisco and at this time to 2005,

211
00:12:51,131 --> 00:12:55,360
we opened the only third wave coffee
company in all of California was ritual.

212
00:12:55,361 --> 00:12:57,670
I'm Valencia it all Cali,

213
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:01,390
they carried stump town and
that was it for the whole state.

214
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:04,510
So at this point in time,
if you opened a cool company anywhere,

215
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,820
people everywhere, I knew about it. Uh,

216
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,810
we were gonna open in San Francisco then
almost open in like Berkeley, Berkeley,

217
00:13:10,811 --> 00:13:15,640
Oakland at the last minute, right before
we were supposed to sign the lease,

218
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,530
I got a call from Ryan.
He just said, dude,

219
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:21,910
I'm living in Santa Cruz
because I got my lady,

220
00:13:21,911 --> 00:13:23,950
we're probably to get married some day,
which he did.

221
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:27,130
And they have two awesome kids,
uh,

222
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:31,880
and said, this is the lifestyle I want
to have. I want to able to surf on it,

223
00:13:31,881 --> 00:13:36,670
all the ride mountain bikes. I want
to build a company where I want to be.

224
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:41,790
And so it kind of fell
apart for like a week or so.

225
00:13:42,581 --> 00:13:46,900
And then I kind of thought, well,
let's just go look at Santa Cruz.

226
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:50,620
And one thing led to another and we
ended up making the commitment there and

227
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:54,130
said, well, let's see if we can
make noise even though we're here,

228
00:13:54,131 --> 00:13:58,870
which we didn't think we'd be
able to to do. But you know,

229
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:00,790
fortunately we were able to do that.

230
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:05,490
That's awesome. Um, so
basically it goes to

231
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:12,050
the idea of work life balance and
choosing a location that can adapt to the

232
00:14:14,031 --> 00:14:16,700
things that you want to do in
life where you can pursue this,

233
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,000
this passion that you have, a dream
that you have that you want to achieve,

234
00:14:20,001 --> 00:14:23,090
but also to be able to maintain.
Like, I want to go surfing,

235
00:14:23,091 --> 00:14:25,490
I want to go mountain biking or whatnot.

236
00:14:25,491 --> 00:14:30,020
So can you talk a little bit more about
that and how you're able to achieve that?

237
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,700
It's pretty cool to rent survey question,
right?

238
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:39,090
It was definitely in the ethos of
starting a company, like as I described,

239
00:14:39,091 --> 00:14:43,260
but I think fast forward
into present day or just,

240
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:49,510
it's hard, you know? I mean it requires
you to saying that you want to do that.

241
00:14:49,511 --> 00:14:52,790
And then, I mean work
life balance, you know,

242
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:55,960
I've heard like in a work
life harmony, you know, um,

243
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,690
Bezos talks about that and I think it's
interesting to think about it because it,

244
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,720
it,
it really determine,

245
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:07,760
it's really dependent on the individual
where they're at in their life,

246
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,100
their age, what they want, what's,

247
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:14,420
and what's energizing them to
determine is that a light switch,

248
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,250
is it a Yin and Yang?

249
00:15:16,251 --> 00:15:20,900
And they have to be opposites and that's
how they are distinct but also fuel

250
00:15:20,901 --> 00:15:21,920
each other.
How you,

251
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:26,930
or is it a fader or is it like I think
of the harmony is like multiple things at

252
00:15:26,931 --> 00:15:27,321
once,

253
00:15:27,321 --> 00:15:32,321
but it's like c major or maybe it's
like d minor depending on how your mood.

254
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,200
I Love d minor. Um, and uh,

255
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,113
but

256
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:45,010
it takes, I think it takes
practice and again, it just,

257
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:46,930
it's different for different people.
I mean,

258
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:56,160
for sure.
You know,

259
00:15:56,161 --> 00:16:00,420
one thing for sure as an exercise is
just, again, like I like corner myself.

260
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:05,010
So is to force yourself into doing
something where you for sure can only be

261
00:16:05,011 --> 00:16:09,660
thinking about that one thing. So whether
that's, a lot of people have sports,

262
00:16:09,661 --> 00:16:13,050
you know, like surfing or mountain
biking, get into your like flow state,

263
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,960
which I know can happen on computers
and a lot of different ways I've

264
00:16:15,961 --> 00:16:16,531
experienced.

265
00:16:16,531 --> 00:16:21,531
But if you take it into like outside of
work and you can pick up an activity or

266
00:16:21,991 --> 00:16:25,950
an exercise, there's some thing
or yoga float tanks, I don't know,

267
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:29,300
whatever it is for people.
I like all that. But uh,

268
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:35,250
that you just have to be in that
moment because it requires all of your

269
00:16:35,251 --> 00:16:39,540
attention and that's like one way to break
whether it's you take always have two

270
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:43,800
days off in a row or every year you take
off for a few weeks ago do something or

271
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:47,190
you know, so there's a lot
of different ways to do that,

272
00:16:47,191 --> 00:16:49,290
but I like trying to figure out,
find activities that

273
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:54,710
requiring all your attention.
That definitely makes sense.

274
00:16:54,711 --> 00:16:59,540
I think that just in general, the culture
here is, or not here as in Google,

275
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:04,541
but here as in the US is that it's very
work focused and to be on the clock all

276
00:17:04,971 --> 00:17:08,810
the time and to make sure you're
doing everything all the time.

277
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:13,520
But there's something to be said about
breaking that up and doing the things

278
00:17:13,521 --> 00:17:15,590
that you love,
making work,

279
00:17:15,591 --> 00:17:19,140
even something that you love and making
sure you're in the right headspace.

280
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,780
And um, I admire the fact
that you're able to go to,

281
00:17:22,781 --> 00:17:25,760
to so many different
activities and focus on them.

282
00:17:25,761 --> 00:17:27,620
And the drive that you
have is really amazing.

283
00:17:27,621 --> 00:17:30,350
So I'm just going to call that out.

284
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,870
I mean, I think you were saying
about enjoying what you do. To me,

285
00:17:33,871 --> 00:17:37,230
that's a big part of it. I mean,
that's why I started my own company,

286
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:42,720
but I just, I, I used to do all of
our orientations for like six years.

287
00:17:42,721 --> 00:17:44,100
Every single employee
that ever worked at Verve,

288
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:47,070
I did every employee's orientation.
I used to just tell people like,

289
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,300
we want people that want be here and
if like you don't want it to be here,

290
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:56,140
I want you to to quit,
which is hard and,

291
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:59,560
and not meaning. Like, cause we're so
cool and like you don't belong, but no,

292
00:17:59,561 --> 00:18:03,910
just like I don't, I will help you find
that, you know, put in notice whatever.

293
00:18:03,911 --> 00:18:05,020
I'll help you find a different job,

294
00:18:05,021 --> 00:18:09,040
but you owe it to yourself to do
something you're passionate about. Uh,

295
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:12,790
whether it's starting your own business
or, or not because people are different,

296
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,540
energized in different
ways or being part of the,

297
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:20,110
a team that has a huge lever
for change like Google,

298
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,970
um, or how you get empowered in
your own way. Um, but I don't,

299
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I do the one thing that kind of the work
life balance when I feel like it's this

300
00:18:30,071 --> 00:18:34,720
dichotomy that I don't like is the feeling
that you would just do something that

301
00:18:34,721 --> 00:18:34,960
you,

302
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,610
that it could mean you put
up with something that you
don't love to do or even

303
00:18:39,611 --> 00:18:42,430
like to do, but you only have
to do it eight hours a day.

304
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,230
And then you get to live your life,
which is cool.

305
00:18:44,231 --> 00:18:47,350
I mean there's like a lot of the best
musicians I've known the world that day,

306
00:18:47,351 --> 00:18:50,440
jobs that more or whatever. But I do, I,

307
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:55,670
I do think it is important to just find
what you're passionate about or fine,

308
00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:01,660
how to be passionate in what you do
because it just makes everything better.

309
00:19:01,661 --> 00:19:03,730
And to me a little bit of,
that's like the harmony part,

310
00:19:03,731 --> 00:19:08,731
which is that you know that your work
should be part of what fulfills you.

311
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:10,750
Right.

312
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,630
And I think that that shows
in your shops as well. Um,

313
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:19,420
I've been to a few of them and
the staff is very friendly.

314
00:19:19,421 --> 00:19:24,010
They all do their job really well and
they seem to actually enjoy being there.

315
00:19:24,011 --> 00:19:28,360
So maybe you can talk about how
you incorporate that into your,

316
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,160
into your company culture.

317
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,950
Yeah, I'm telling them that they can
quit if they don't really want it.

318
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:39,390
I want to tell people they have to quit
if they don't want to be here. But um,

319
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:44,370
because I think that's what people
should do but uh, for themselves.

320
00:19:44,371 --> 00:19:49,371
But it is something that's probably
been the most difficult thing as we've

321
00:19:51,001 --> 00:19:54,730
scaled. Um, because as you,

322
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,750
when you have one shop or the small team,
right,

323
00:19:57,751 --> 00:20:00,630
I forget the number of people talk
about is like a for a small tribe,

324
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:05,460
10 1530 people. But once you
blow it, once you exceed that,

325
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,890
there's a lot that happens is innately,

326
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,160
especially when you have the
small group leaders are present,

327
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,840
this trickle down effect.
It just,

328
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,370
it's is very obvious to everyone that
it's easier to set expectations without

329
00:20:17,371 --> 00:20:21,990
having things so explicitly written.
But as you scale,

330
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:24,030
you know,
40 50,

331
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:28,350
80 102 hundred employees we
have at verve now, oh Nah man,

332
00:20:28,351 --> 00:20:30,600
please Google House.
But I'm sure it's more than 200.

333
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:35,670
That's probably about 200 and this room.
And uh,

334
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:39,990
but it's the hardest thing to do is to
scale culture because at a certain point

335
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:45,540
you have to like literally be thinking,
how am I engineering culture now?

336
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,490
And it feels
there's a,

337
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:55,940
a falseness that's a word that comes
with that idea that your engineering

338
00:20:56,531 --> 00:20:56,831
culture.

339
00:20:56,831 --> 00:21:00,370
But I kind of became a numbered with that
a little bit because what you're just

340
00:21:00,371 --> 00:21:01,330
trying to,
it's,

341
00:21:01,331 --> 00:21:05,350
it's a point of being self reflective
about being reflective and self aware as a

342
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:10,620
brand and as a company about and to figure
out how you want to communicate that

343
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:15,060
and to build that into the culture at,

344
00:21:15,061 --> 00:21:18,610
to set those expectations and
then ultimately have, you know,

345
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:21,550
the right people on the bus.
I mean, I'm a big fan of,

346
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,790
I know maybe it's like old school
now, but like, you know, good to great

347
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,440
Jim Collins getting the right people on
the bus. There's no substitute for that.

348
00:21:29,441 --> 00:21:30,274
You cannot,

349
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:35,320
you cannot train somebody and to get in
it like you have to just get the right

350
00:21:35,321 --> 00:21:40,030
people and then figure
out how to empower them.

351
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:42,580
And that's what we're,
that's what we've done at verve.

352
00:21:42,581 --> 00:21:45,820
And that's what I think we're really
focused on this this next year and beyond,

353
00:21:45,821 --> 00:21:50,740
is to really figure out how to build
a framework so that people really feel

354
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:54,580
empowered and can sort of channel their
own entrepreneurial spirit and what they

355
00:21:54,581 --> 00:21:57,390
do. And that, that's a
little bit of, I think what,

356
00:21:57,391 --> 00:21:58,980
what you experience when
you come in diversion,

357
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,280
you have people smile and greet at you.

358
00:22:00,281 --> 00:22:04,810
We'd been criticized for being
too friendly. Whoops. You know,

359
00:22:04,811 --> 00:22:08,320
cause some people think it's fake,
but I don't ever want that.

360
00:22:08,321 --> 00:22:10,620
I didn't want there to ever
be a fake vibe at verve. It's,

361
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:12,370
it's not that we don't tell people like,

362
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:15,730
and then make sure you put on your smile
and get your flavor badges and like,

363
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:20,200
it's not about that. It's like we tell
people just be normal. Like, just be real.

364
00:22:20,201 --> 00:22:23,050
If you're not someone who
would say smaller, say hey,

365
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:25,540
how's it going to someone who like
walks in and stands in front of you,

366
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:30,460
then like, okay, that's like, that's your
world, but maybe this isn't, you know,

367
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:32,740
for, it's not the right
culture for you. So we're just,

368
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,240
we just try to find friendly,
outgoing people that wanted,

369
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,960
like take care of you and
tell them to just be normal.

370
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,110
I'm sorry.
I guess leading into that,

371
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:46,070
we can go on the flip side of that to
your relationship with your vendors,

372
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:49,340
the people who provide,
um, the coffee grounds.

373
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,690
You want to talk about that a little bit?

374
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:55,530
Sure. The grounds, the
grounds, I'm sorry, the beans.

375
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,240
I'm just kidding. People see
our restaurant sometimes and uh,

376
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:04,380
and um, see Brian Santa Cruz where
we have our restaurant, it's all,

377
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:06,900
we've always created this like whole
fishbowl effect with our rescue. We,

378
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:10,320
it's very transparent where what we do
and you can come see it and they always

379
00:23:10,321 --> 00:23:15,270
see these big round drums, slit
cylinders rather. And they say,

380
00:23:15,271 --> 00:23:19,230
Oh, is that, is that where you grind
the beans? But there's a giant grinders,

381
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:23,530
but there are coffee roasters. But
anyway, I'm just kidding. That's good.

382
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:28,620
Call me out. Um, yeah. Uh,
yeah, for sure. I mean,

383
00:23:28,621 --> 00:23:33,390
we call it, uh, like our sourcing
program at verve farm level,

384
00:23:33,391 --> 00:23:37,500
we call it a is does go full
circle for me personally,

385
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:42,501
back to grind up on a farm and
with a parent who was with parents.

386
00:23:43,591 --> 00:23:44,910
But My, you know, my dad, we're going,

387
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:49,280
my mom growing up on a farm myself and
then my dad also grew up a farm and going

388
00:23:49,281 --> 00:23:50,021
to UC Davis,

389
00:23:50,021 --> 00:23:53,210
it was really instilled and being like
really take care of business people that

390
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:58,220
never did shortcuts and just kept,
you know,

391
00:23:58,221 --> 00:24:02,010
the orchards and vineyards,
meticulous all year round.

392
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:04,250
Never had garbage on the ground.
Everything's just perfect.

393
00:24:04,251 --> 00:24:08,450
And the fruit you would
show that, you know, my,

394
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:13,580
they grew some of the best, uh,
somebody on blank and Paris anywhere in,

395
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,050
in the world and,

396
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:20,490
but they never really got
pretty premiums for it.

397
00:24:20,491 --> 00:24:24,900
They're just treated as a commodity
and it's like kids on laptops, spine.

398
00:24:24,901 --> 00:24:28,040
What's this? How much is the price? How
much is it over here? 4 cents cheaper.

399
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:31,650
Pound over here, buy it here, send it
to the grocer with no sense of light.

400
00:24:31,651 --> 00:24:33,690
But what's the difference in quality?
Who are these people?

401
00:24:33,691 --> 00:24:38,240
What's their background? Is
there any value? Add weekend,
you know, like the, just,

402
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:42,030
it's just, just a
commodity and coffee, uh,

403
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:46,140
being one of the more traded commodities
in the world. I mean for prospective,

404
00:24:46,141 --> 00:24:47,730
how much coffees out there Starbucks by,

405
00:24:47,731 --> 00:24:50,130
it's like 2.2 and a half
percent of the world's coffee.

406
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:54,840
So there's the other 97 and a half
percent of the world's coffee that's not

407
00:24:54,841 --> 00:24:58,320
being sold by Starbucks.
That's how big the market is.

408
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,300
It's a commodity market.

409
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:05,450
And so while we got into verve and
wanting to figure out how we could do

410
00:25:05,761 --> 00:25:06,660
something different,

411
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:11,220
and the tipping point of what became
kind of third wave coffee was to go find

412
00:25:11,221 --> 00:25:13,350
the best coffees in the world
and that there was this,

413
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:19,740
this new new world
happening of discovery and,

414
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:25,910
and just extraordinary flavors coming
into the world of coffee and we sought to

415
00:25:26,131 --> 00:25:29,730
go find them.
So when we started for the first,

416
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:36,690
I'm not sure if for six, seven years or
so, I was, I was our only coffee buyer.

417
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:39,450
So I traveled like four months out
of the year all around the globe,

418
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,970
Central America, South
Africa, South America,

419
00:25:41,971 --> 00:25:46,500
east Africa for like four months out of
the year traveling to go find coffees.

420
00:25:46,501 --> 00:25:49,680
Meat Producers.
Go back and see those producers again,

421
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:52,740
discover new gyms out,

422
00:25:52,741 --> 00:25:55,830
position people on coffees
and to really help find them,

423
00:25:55,831 --> 00:26:00,580
but also to help be part of what is
maybe the point of the spear of, uh,

424
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,740
enormous global industry.
But to just help

425
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:09,810
say we're willing to pay you
equitably for this work you do,

426
00:26:09,811 --> 00:26:14,160
which produces an extraordinary
Lee high quality product,

427
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:17,040
that same product that
we're then going to take

428
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:23,910
and sell at a higher premium
than we maybe some people sell.

429
00:26:24,671 --> 00:26:27,550
Definitely compared to
what most people sell. Uh,

430
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:30,250
because there's a value that
it's worth it and we think

431
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:32,363
that

432
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,310
it gets some off the rails here.

433
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:40,050
But I was just like this fully steered
away from it how being nice to producers.

434
00:26:40,051 --> 00:26:44,060
But um, which we are,
but no, but to me I can,

435
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,350
the economic lever is like
the most important lever.

436
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,970
If you want to help a
farmer pay them more,

437
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:51,630
you can go ask every single one of our
farmers and say, what do you really need?

438
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:55,140
And they're just going to say,
just pay me more. They're like,

439
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:56,970
a lot of people think like farmers.

440
00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:01,980
It's like a pity thing and all this
and I don't, I hate that marketing.

441
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:05,640
I hate that kind of cause marketing for
coffee for producers because growing up

442
00:27:05,641 --> 00:27:10,410
on a farm like my grandpa,
so bad ass, my dad

443
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:14,040
hard as nails.
Like those are not,

444
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:17,790
those are the last people on earth
that want your pity or like farmers,

445
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,480
they just want to be treated fairly and
to feel like their hard work is like

446
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:25,163
worth it.

447
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:29,310
They have enough stress with like mother
nature and a lot of other things than

448
00:27:29,311 --> 00:27:30,144
to,

449
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:35,100
so we sort of built our business
around that and you know,

450
00:27:35,101 --> 00:27:38,640
and it really starts with customers
paying more for a cup of coffee because

451
00:27:38,641 --> 00:27:42,630
there's x amount of dollars in a cup
of coffee and then everyone has their

452
00:27:42,631 --> 00:27:46,590
margins and I believe in supply chain.
I mean you need,

453
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:50,070
you know, someone's drinking
the coffee, going back in time,

454
00:27:50,071 --> 00:27:54,180
someone's delivering the coffee,
roasting the coffee, buying the coffee,

455
00:27:54,181 --> 00:27:56,490
importing the coffee,
someone export at the coffee,

456
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,720
someone shipped it and insured it in
between someone milled the coffee for

457
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:04,560
export right before that somebody
processed the freshly picked cherries.

458
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:07,890
And then someone grew those cherries.
You need all of those steps.

459
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,660
I mean people can be vertically
integrated or whatever,

460
00:28:09,661 --> 00:28:12,240
but those steps don't go away.
And everyone,

461
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,740
I think it's cool if everyone
has a sustainable business,

462
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:19,320
transparent business model. Uh,
like the middlemen concept is that

463
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:25,830
it middlemen to me are more like as a
term tied to people that operate within a

464
00:28:26,761 --> 00:28:30,330
supply chain that take advantage of it
without transparency and exploit people

465
00:28:30,331 --> 00:28:33,990
on either side of them.
But as far as steps in a supply chain,

466
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:39,020
everybody's critical and we all through
those points of the supply chain,

467
00:28:39,811 --> 00:28:44,220
we treat all of them with as much respect
and honesty and transparency as we can

468
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,120
because at one end of that supply,

469
00:28:48,121 --> 00:28:52,620
at the other end of the supply chain
is the producer and at the end that the

470
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:53,041
other end,

471
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:57,360
the bookmarks are literally
coffee drinkers and coffee
growers and they're the

472
00:28:57,361 --> 00:29:01,470
most disconnected physically
and emotionally. You know,

473
00:29:01,471 --> 00:29:04,170
like people that are like growing
coffee on the hills and Santa Barbara,

474
00:29:04,171 --> 00:29:09,171
Honduras totally can't necessarily
relate to people that work at Google but,

475
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:14,100
or maybe vice versa. But those are
like the two most important parts.

476
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:17,730
Everyone else is facilitating.
Yeah. You could say we're curators,

477
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:20,490
we go find this stuff. This is
cool, this is hot, this is not,

478
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,820
but you need someone to throw
it on money at the one end.

479
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,580
I needed someone to be willing
to produce at the other end.

480
00:29:26,581 --> 00:29:30,090
And those two need to kind of
have that synergy between the two.

481
00:29:30,091 --> 00:29:35,091
So we work really hard in our whole
business to create that bridge and sort of

482
00:29:36,331 --> 00:29:40,420
foster that economy.
So yeah,

483
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,980
I was really curious that decision

484
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:46,210
to be in Santa Cruz and not one of the
obvious places that you were probably

485
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,240
thinking about being,
um,

486
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:51,940
a lot of us here in marketing or touch
marketing and I would think, you know,

487
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:55,750
you have to go where the businesses
are, where the people would be. Um,

488
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:00,280
how was marketing for you and getting
your name out and getting going when maybe

489
00:30:00,281 --> 00:30:04,450
you're thinking about just, you know,
surfer surfer is walking in for coffee.

490
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,250
It's not necessarily someone
that's gonna I dunno,

491
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,700
like a business person in the valley.

492
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:12,850
Yes. Being aware that people
are, could have, I mean,

493
00:30:12,851 --> 00:30:14,350
if we had opened in San
Francisco 10 years ago,

494
00:30:14,351 --> 00:30:17,560
maybe we'd be even in a
different type of company, uh,

495
00:30:17,561 --> 00:30:20,530
as far as timing and everything.
But for me,

496
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:25,720
although we were based in Santa Cruz
for like are for like some personnel

497
00:30:25,721 --> 00:30:28,360
reasons,
Ryan and I,

498
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:32,200
our goal was never to be the
best coffee in Santa Cruz.

499
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:36,250
Our goal is to be the best coffee in
the world and to create the best coffee

500
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,150
company in the world.

501
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:42,400
We just didn't know if anyone was ever
going to even get it or care, but we were,

502
00:30:42,401 --> 00:30:46,810
that was our path was like, I
want our coffee to be, you know,

503
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:50,950
our influences were my, you know, my
friends out of Oslo, Norway, and you know,

504
00:30:50,951 --> 00:30:53,350
just like what's happening
in Australia and Melbourne.

505
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:56,740
Like we were really wanting
to step up to that stage.

506
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:01,350
And I think it's because of that. Uh, and,

507
00:31:01,351 --> 00:31:05,950
and the timing of when we, when we
opened, uh, as early super early adopters,

508
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:09,070
uh, that's kind of how it
all, how it all came together.

509
00:31:09,071 --> 00:31:12,190
And then once we had those
little opportunities,

510
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,520
we had product that stepped up to
it. I mean, one of our first places,

511
00:31:15,521 --> 00:31:17,890
our brand ever went from
Santa Cruz like two months in,

512
00:31:17,891 --> 00:31:22,270
was straight to the heart of Manhattan
with a cafe grumpy out there,

513
00:31:22,271 --> 00:31:25,700
who at the time was the east
coast caught ritual. Ah,

514
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:27,160
there's a lot more on these coast now.

515
00:31:27,161 --> 00:31:32,161
But they were very early and someone
came to Santa Cruz and had our coffee.

516
00:31:32,261 --> 00:31:32,921
That was amazing.

517
00:31:32,921 --> 00:31:36,250
Brought a bag of her Ethiopia
Conga and brought it back to them.

518
00:31:36,251 --> 00:31:38,860
And I remember I was working bar and I
had to duck down behind the counter and I

519
00:31:38,861 --> 00:31:40,660
got a call from the manager cafe grumpy.
They said,

520
00:31:40,661 --> 00:31:42,550
we want to feature you
on bar here in Manhattan.

521
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:45,640
And then that's how all of our strength
in the New York Times heard about us.

522
00:31:45,641 --> 00:31:49,000
And then he wrote about it. It
just, so it was based on quality,

523
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:51,080
but um,

524
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:55,990
and I think the idea that
we were trying to think big,

525
00:31:55,991 --> 00:31:59,860
but even just because that's what we
wanted out of the company personally.

526
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,220
Um,
and then that ended up working.

527
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:07,880
So I guess kind of like secret in
it a little bit. And, and, and,

528
00:32:07,881 --> 00:32:10,750
and as the brand,
the brand's super important,

529
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,960
like straight up like design brand that
always matters to us how we want to

530
00:32:17,051 --> 00:32:20,020
design our stores, customer
experience, how we want to look,

531
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,940
feed what we think of the brand.

532
00:32:21,941 --> 00:32:24,310
We've always really been into
brand and design as well.

533
00:32:24,311 --> 00:32:26,860
So we always thought of that.

534
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,280
That's kind of a two part question,

535
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:34,281
but you mentioned that when you were
initially picking your first location,

536
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,790
uh, third wave coffee hadn't
really taken off yet. Right. Um,

537
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:41,060
and obviously in the last 10, uh,
there's been an explosion of that,

538
00:32:41,061 --> 00:32:45,170
especially in the bay area from the
equator, four barrel, et Cetera. Um,

539
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:50,510
the, the first question is, uh,
amongst the other third wave players,

540
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:53,930
are there any that you
really admire and why? Um,

541
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,140
and the second piece of
that is how do you see, uh,

542
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:01,730
how do you see verve in relation to
some of the other players in this space?

543
00:33:01,731 --> 00:33:06,620
What, from, from your perspective,
really sets verve apart from

544
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,640
in the pack? Sure. Yeah, I mean,

545
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,630
well it's kind of split into two groups
really because a lot of the people that

546
00:33:13,631 --> 00:33:14,464
were our biggest,

547
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:18,940
a couple of people that were
big influences on us when
we were opening Stumptown,

548
00:33:18,941 --> 00:33:22,620
Intelligentsia Ryan,
my business partner,

549
00:33:22,621 --> 00:33:26,140
his brother worked at the blue bottle
kiosk on Linden street when that was all

550
00:33:26,141 --> 00:33:30,250
they had. So we go back in that world.
Those were all influences on us.

551
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:31,211
And as you know,

552
00:33:31,211 --> 00:33:33,940
there's been a lot of business activity
with a lot of brands including those

553
00:33:33,941 --> 00:33:38,440
three brands. So now that they're
kind of off the table in that regard

554
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:40,430
in uh,

555
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:45,310
you know, with the MNA stuff
that's happened, looking to
the other side of things,

556
00:33:45,311 --> 00:33:49,950
what other brands are out there that
now influence us or that I think are

557
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:54,420
influential? I mean
there's, there's a lot,

558
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,630
I mean I see stuff all the
time on Instagram and new
people brands fall on us or

559
00:33:57,631 --> 00:33:59,870
something. I'm like, who's
this? I check it out. I'm like,
damn, that's a killer logo.

560
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,610
That brand package, that packaging
is cool. I like how they did this.

561
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:05,760
I see like cold beverage drinks being
made and serving where and I'm like,

562
00:34:05,761 --> 00:34:06,594
that's hot.

563
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,530
I just see it's kind of things happening
all the time here and there and you

564
00:34:10,531 --> 00:34:14,610
know, um, but like the, the
major brands that had, you know,

565
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:19,230
it had a lot influence on us early just
because you look up to see like, well,

566
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,080
who's doing it and who else is doing it?
And those were the ones we looked up to.

567
00:34:22,081 --> 00:34:27,081
So now we're kind of like on our own
trajectory and how we feel different.

568
00:34:27,181 --> 00:34:29,970
I mean,
we,

569
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:35,730
I feel like we've always
had service first.

570
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:41,280
Uh, especially like 10 years
ago and that was super not cool.

571
00:34:41,281 --> 00:34:43,830
And the cliches of like,
you know, you know,

572
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:48,480
waxed a waxed mustaches and like, you
know, suspenders and all this stuff.

573
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:53,790
Um, and Rockstar Baristas, we were
like super anti that. In fact,

574
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:57,090
that's actually one of the main reasons
we never opened in San Francisco is that

575
00:34:57,091 --> 00:35:01,410
we just didn't, there was like an energy
that was happening, very young, young,

576
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:05,010
tense energy and we were just not,

577
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:07,380
we didn't want to really
get pulled into that world.

578
00:35:07,381 --> 00:35:08,820
We wanted to just kind
of do our own thing.

579
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,153
And

580
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,710
so I guess maybe that's another way.

581
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:16,190
We've always just done our own thing
and worried about what we're up to.

582
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:19,400
I totally influenced and love
seeing what everyone's doing.

583
00:35:19,401 --> 00:35:21,980
I'm super into like all
everything that happens,

584
00:35:21,981 --> 00:35:25,040
but at the end of the day of verb,
we just go to RM.

585
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:29,180
We kinda just go our own path
and be really nice to people,

586
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,280
really focus on our retail environments.

587
00:35:31,281 --> 00:35:34,220
Being more residential than commercial,

588
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:39,750
have wholesale program that can step up
and really service like this level of

589
00:35:39,751 --> 00:35:42,960
business but still be like
down to Earth are, you know,

590
00:35:42,961 --> 00:35:45,150
we're putting a liar and Shannon
to our online stuff right now.

591
00:35:45,151 --> 00:35:47,040
And then we have some RTD and some other,

592
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:50,310
some cool single start of stuff that
we're working on for like new innovative,

593
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,140
like next step stuff with our company.

594
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:56,570
I drink coffee, uh, occasionally. Um,

595
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:59,430
don't really think about
what's in my cup too much. Um,

596
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:01,270
maybe everybody here knows what it is,

597
00:36:01,271 --> 00:36:05,530
but I don't really know much about like
third wave coffee and like what that

598
00:36:05,531 --> 00:36:09,160
movement means. And like was
there a first wave, a second wave?

599
00:36:09,161 --> 00:36:13,560
Is there like a fourth one? Like it went
and I got an ninth, six then third. Okay.

600
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:15,970
Um,
so I was just kind of wondering,

601
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:18,970
maybe you could provide some more
context on that and also maybe talk about

602
00:36:18,971 --> 00:36:20,230
where you got your name from.

603
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:25,260
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, those
are great questions because uh,

604
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:29,760
yeah, I mean the idea of first
wave, second wave, third wave,

605
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:31,320
um,

606
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:35,160
loosely is like first wave is like our
grandparents coffee institutional canned

607
00:36:35,161 --> 00:36:37,830
coffee, Folgers, you ban Maxwell House,

608
00:36:37,831 --> 00:36:42,000
sort of that post war era coffee,

609
00:36:42,001 --> 00:36:43,080
which was really where coffee,

610
00:36:43,081 --> 00:36:46,710
you got big in the u s and really
started the real commercialization and

611
00:36:46,711 --> 00:36:50,220
commoditization of coffee second wave.

612
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,020
So that ran for like 30 years or so.

613
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:55,770
Then second wave comes about with
basically is Starbucks revolution,

614
00:36:55,771 --> 00:37:00,390
Howard Schultz creating co going from
just like coffee as this thing that you

615
00:37:00,391 --> 00:37:01,260
take two scoops,

616
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:06,000
put it in here mixed with water and you
have coffee or it's like 25 cent diner

617
00:37:06,001 --> 00:37:10,260
coffee and nickel diner coffee into
now you step into espresso culture,

618
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:14,130
espresso drinks basically espresso
culture for starters that that came,

619
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,500
that Howard brought from Europe,
um,

620
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:20,010
after visiting there and
the idea of like $4 coffee,

621
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:23,610
you know that kind of
concept of espresso culture,

622
00:37:23,611 --> 00:37:28,611
$4 coffee and coffee houses as like
he's coined the term third place,

623
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:32,910
you know, your work home and this other
place whether it's coffee shopper or not,

624
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:37,080
but just this idea that coffee isn't
just the senior grandpa drinks in the

625
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:40,740
morning before going out and like
bailing hay. It's like, cool,

626
00:37:40,741 --> 00:37:43,560
I'm going to like my mom does it
and like meet your friends there.

627
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:48,690
So that second wave and then third wave
came as like just this next generation

628
00:37:48,691 --> 00:37:52,950
said grew up, everyone grows up on the
previous generation. Grew up on Starbucks,

629
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:54,751
not me personally,

630
00:37:54,751 --> 00:37:58,590
but just because I grew up in this super
small towns and have Starbucks still

631
00:37:58,591 --> 00:38:00,450
doesn't. Um, but, uh,

632
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:06,030
that what's next and, and
I, and that there was,

633
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:10,320
people started finding these little
lots of coffee that tasted difference.

634
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:14,100
The auction systems that
in the coffee world,

635
00:38:14,101 --> 00:38:18,090
in the niche inside world started
for like the best of Panama auctions,

636
00:38:18,091 --> 00:38:21,120
these couple of excellence auctions where
they started rewarding farmers based

637
00:38:21,121 --> 00:38:25,200
on Cup quality blind and having
auctions for their coffee. Um,

638
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:28,260
there was a book written
called God and a cup, uh,

639
00:38:28,261 --> 00:38:33,261
that really was a turning point to put
third wave on the map and this and the

640
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:36,010
gay, you know, and, um,

641
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:41,170
the Geisha variety of coffee that has
been sort of synonymous with the highest

642
00:38:41,171 --> 00:38:44,080
quality,
although you know

643
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,310
that that symbol is,
is,

644
00:38:48,311 --> 00:38:52,840
is definitely it's game plan in a lot of
places that maybe that coffee shouldn't

645
00:38:52,841 --> 00:38:56,140
grow, but where it still grows the best
la places where we get that coffee,

646
00:38:56,141 --> 00:38:58,390
it's still one of the
best coffees in the world.

647
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:02,020
So those are kind of like those
three, three phases. So yeah. Yeah.

648
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:04,440
GRANDPA's coffee,
Starbucks revolution.

649
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:07,180
And then for lack of a better term,

650
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:11,020
the hipster coffee world that we all
think of Ms Coffee. Those are like the,

651
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:16,090
although I'm sure like in 1975 if
you were like 20 and you got coffee,

652
00:39:16,091 --> 00:39:17,300
you thought you were,
you were,

653
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:20,020
you were a hipster getting coffee
at the hipster coffee shop bridges.

654
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:24,850
So those are the three areas.
And then, um, everyone,

655
00:39:24,851 --> 00:39:26,980
a lot people ask what's fourth
wave? You know, I'm not,

656
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,110
people are ready to jump
to fourth way right now.

657
00:39:29,111 --> 00:39:31,720
And I've heard like fourth wave
is cold brew, fourth wave is this,

658
00:39:31,721 --> 00:39:34,690
fourth wave is convenience. Fourth
wave is bringing food into your cafes.

659
00:39:34,691 --> 00:39:36,440
Like we brought like a lot of,
uh,

660
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:41,350
more Melbourne since sort of concepts
into our store. Avocado since like that.

661
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:45,220
Um, I don't know. I think to me that's
still an extrapolation of third wave.

662
00:39:45,221 --> 00:39:48,880
Fourth wave probably shouldn't really
come for like another 10 or 15 years per

663
00:39:48,881 --> 00:39:50,680
the,
unless we're kind of on a

664
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:56,350
geometric sort of growth
plan hair. But, um,

665
00:39:57,370 --> 00:40:00,640
yeah. So, and then if we're
on our name, verve, it's,

666
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:05,170
it originally came because it's, it's a
record label of verve records, verve jet.

667
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,480
It's a jazz label.
And we were just trying to think of names.

668
00:40:07,481 --> 00:40:09,580
We had a million names and Ryan,

669
00:40:09,581 --> 00:40:14,410
cause we both play music and
jazz said what about verve?

670
00:40:14,411 --> 00:40:19,411
And it Kinda just stuck and we looked
it up and was available and kind of sat

671
00:40:20,171 --> 00:40:23,980
with it for awhile and we ended
up calling ourselves that. So,

672
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:28,360
but it means the spirit and enthusiasm
surrounding the creation of art.

673
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:32,230
And so once we saw the
definition, I was like, damn,

674
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:37,990
that really feels right.
Like it's like passion energy.

675
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,330
Like if you have a lot of verve,

676
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:43,690
you maybe that's the energy you feel
when you come into a river of cafe people

677
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:48,040
behind the bar.
It's like trying to just be posy.

678
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:53,020
Oh, I was gonna also ask you how you get
your name. Um, so that was an easy one.

679
00:40:53,021 --> 00:40:56,450
So I'm going to totally pivot
and ask you a tough one. Um,

680
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:58,520
thanks for coming.
By the way,

681
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:03,640
I'm just thinking about like coffee has
this like very specific kind of climate

682
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:07,490
that it grows in and you see it, you
know, and that quick tutorial regions.

683
00:41:07,491 --> 00:41:12,491
And I think anecdotally it seems like a
lot of those regions are also areas of

684
00:41:12,861 --> 00:41:17,840
high conflict. And you look at Central
America or Yemen, parts of Africa,

685
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:23,360
like what's our role in all of that? And
we're so, so separated from the growers,

686
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:28,610
um, just because of the nature of how
coffee grows and where we are physically.

687
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:34,100
Um, do you have a role in that? Like
for good or for bad? Do you have a point

688
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:39,100
of view on like how our collective hunger
for coffee is hopefully making lives

689
00:41:40,011 --> 00:41:44,190
better and, yeah, that's a good question.

690
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:48,630
I don't work for the
CIA and I just watched,

691
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,180
I'm totally up to speed on
narcos. So, um, so yeah,

692
00:41:54,181 --> 00:41:58,800
I can answer this
question. Um, it's, you're,

693
00:41:58,801 --> 00:42:02,730
I mean you're right, it's, it's
crazy. I mean like all Latin America,

694
00:42:02,731 --> 00:42:03,960
I mentioned narcos cause that's,

695
00:42:03,961 --> 00:42:07,830
I mean you hear about this when
you travel to all these countries,

696
00:42:07,831 --> 00:42:12,120
you hear about the history of a lot
things that back in the day felt like

697
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:16,770
conspiratorial and then you're
like, oh yeah. But then everyone,

698
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,410
you just hear it firsthand. Um, you know,

699
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,260
that's like another
talk probably. But, uh,

700
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:23,813
mmm.

701
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:28,220
With just US involvement, obviously
I'm not a Latin American studies,

702
00:42:28,221 --> 00:42:30,830
but I'm sure there's people that could
school me all up on that. But it's,

703
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:34,220
you know, it's, it's, it's tough. Um,

704
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:40,330
I mean there are certain places that we
don't buy coffee from because it's so

705
00:42:40,521 --> 00:42:45,320
complicated. But I wanted
to travel there. Like,

706
00:42:45,321 --> 00:42:48,720
I can't go to Yemen
right now, but, um, uh,

707
00:42:48,721 --> 00:42:51,290
I mean I've been to Rwanda and
Burundi and I've been in Kenya,

708
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:56,320
like in part in parts of Ethiopia
and all places in Colombia.

709
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,520
It gets, it can get really real
down there in southern Columbia, but

710
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,193
MMM.

711
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:03,850
And they,
certain places I can in Columbia,

712
00:43:03,851 --> 00:43:06,400
I can't go and either
overnight or I can't,

713
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,270
you can't even really
go during the daytime.

714
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:10,990
But we go to a lot of out
there places in Colombia.

715
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,050
But to answer your question,

716
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:19,830
I see coffee as a lever for change and
I see that lever really saying the word

717
00:43:22,451 --> 00:43:26,370
quality on it. And that's the lever,
the coffee lever that we moved.

718
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:31,010
And to me I just really believe that
not like what we do is so important.

719
00:43:31,011 --> 00:43:33,620
Like for like we're,
I mean we're just a small sliver,

720
00:43:33,621 --> 00:43:37,910
but all we can do is what we can do.
And we want to do it clearly and loudly.

721
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:41,930
And that is to just say that that's
probably recently we traveled to go meet

722
00:43:41,931 --> 00:43:46,931
producers is to understand who
they are and to understand what,

723
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:51,860
how, what, how our approach
can help them. Again,

724
00:43:51,861 --> 00:43:54,050
not out of charity.
Farmers don't want your charity,

725
00:43:54,051 --> 00:43:58,160
they just want to be treated
fairly. But A, we go.

726
00:43:58,870 --> 00:43:59,703
So I,

727
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:01,103
yeah,

728
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:04,390
I think one of the best things you can
do is just help help create, you know,

729
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:07,810
for any farming families help create a
stable economy and something that they

730
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:10,750
can count on. And some
end if there. And if the,

731
00:44:10,751 --> 00:44:12,850
if you find producers
that have a good address,

732
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:17,560
their farms in a good spot and they're
willing to put in this extra work because

733
00:44:17,561 --> 00:44:19,450
they're passionate about it,
you see it all the time.

734
00:44:19,451 --> 00:44:21,070
The best farmers are the
most passionate ones.

735
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:25,000
There's ones that get lucky
but not really. You need,

736
00:44:25,001 --> 00:44:29,110
you do need to have a good site this
side of the hill, this elevation,

737
00:44:29,111 --> 00:44:31,620
the separate macroclimate
this aspect of the soil, this,

738
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:36,980
but really it comes down to the farmers
passion and hard work and I do feel like

739
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:44,310
what we do in that way is good because
it opens up opportunities for people to

740
00:44:44,311 --> 00:44:48,380
make more, have more opportunities and
more decision making authority and,

741
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:53,970
and how they, how they live. But it's
super complex. I mean East Africa,

742
00:44:53,971 --> 00:44:55,110
Yemen come on,

743
00:44:55,140 --> 00:45:00,120
I mean like Kenya even and then
all of Latin America is mostly,

744
00:45:00,121 --> 00:45:02,940
it's, it's, it really simmer down a
lot. But then with aisle the aisle,

745
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:06,000
everything happened with the cartel
and stuff like that. It's, you know,

746
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:10,650
it's its own thing, but we try to
steer clear of it and just started,

747
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:12,720
do what we can to empower farmers.

748
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:18,050
I wonder about this notion of paying
for quality and a lot of the talk about

749
00:45:19,141 --> 00:45:23,380
like the progression of a
coffee and how it's viewed. Um,

750
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:27,570
is there anything else or like any other
industries or within the food space

751
00:45:27,571 --> 00:45:32,520
even where you see an opportunity for
that transition to happen where people

752
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,860
have expectations of,
you know,

753
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:39,330
paying very little for something where
you can see kind of bringing like you

754
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:42,330
either higher quality options or um,

755
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:45,960
higher quality brands with
also that higher price tag.

756
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:50,240
It's, I mean it's probably an
everything to be honest with you.

757
00:45:50,241 --> 00:45:54,380
I mean part of it is what
industries globally are
available for that and part of

758
00:45:54,381 --> 00:45:57,470
it is how we nationally think about food.

759
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:01,970
So I can remember the statistic off
hand. I've like, I've said it before,

760
00:46:01,971 --> 00:46:06,590
but I'm like the percentage of Americans
spend on food is like really low in the

761
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:10,190
developing world. It's
like, don't hold me to this,

762
00:46:10,191 --> 00:46:11,420
but it's something like a quarter,

763
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:14,990
like a lot of people on like
France or Italy spend on food.

764
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:19,330
It's a part of it is just
a descent d a d sense,

765
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:25,510
a decent Tizen density to say,

766
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:26,703
you know what I'm saying?

767
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:30,500
We are desensitized on the price of food
because of a lot of reasons including

768
00:46:30,501 --> 00:46:32,570
like subsidies and corn
and things like that.

769
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:37,220
And we see that as the value add is
cheaper is better and bigger is better.

770
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:39,050
Not this room necessarily,

771
00:46:39,051 --> 00:46:42,950
but that's just this thing that's been
kind of drilled be cut for good reasons

772
00:46:42,951 --> 00:46:47,390
because that's like how people think about
food security is one of the best ways

773
00:46:47,391 --> 00:46:50,870
to like, you know, growing nation. But

774
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:56,980
so I think you could look at almost
anything and think, well what, what,

775
00:46:56,981 --> 00:47:00,470
what is the version of this that
helps create change in what,

776
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:06,130
who is in the supply chain that wants
to do better and who's already wants to

777
00:47:06,171 --> 00:47:10,550
produce something better and how
do we help them have a voice?

778
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:14,060
I mean you could, I mean like
parallel problems ti ti does really,

779
00:47:14,061 --> 00:47:16,760
I mean t t has done really amazing.
I mean really,

780
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:21,440
really amazing tea growers in China and
Japan can get paid really great prices

781
00:47:21,441 --> 00:47:22,011
for their tea.

782
00:47:22,011 --> 00:47:26,960
I mean you can pick any commodity and
dissect it and try to find out how we

783
00:47:26,961 --> 00:47:30,510
could leverage the people that
want to do quality because I,

784
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:34,420
I I want,
and I believe it's us helping producers,

785
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:38,080
but I also think there's just a huge
audience. It just wants better stuff.

786
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:41,530
Like there's a huge audience of people
that just like I paid 50 50 cents more

787
00:47:41,531 --> 00:47:45,250
for blackberries if they always tasted
amazing or like strawberries or,

788
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:47,680
I mean you can just pick anything
you eat any fruit and say,

789
00:47:47,681 --> 00:47:50,080
would you be willing to pay 50 cents more?

790
00:47:50,081 --> 00:47:53,590
Because that could be like a
20 30% increase in the price.

791
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:57,610
It can be applied almost anywhere we
choose just to be focused in coffee.

792
00:47:57,611 --> 00:48:00,130
But I do think about that a lot from,

793
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:02,920
and that there's an audience that wants,

794
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:06,670
there's an audience that wants quality
and they want to have this better

795
00:48:06,671 --> 00:48:09,570
experience in their life and they're
willing to pay for it. And there's people,

796
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:11,350
people that want to produce that,

797
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:15,970
and it's just connecting those two ends
of the supply chain because without

798
00:48:15,971 --> 00:48:19,780
them, without people producing high
quality anything, there's nothing,

799
00:48:19,781 --> 00:48:20,770
no product for people to buy.

800
00:48:20,771 --> 00:48:25,030
And without people willing to step up
and pay premiums for quality experiences,

801
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:28,420
then there's no livelihood or
reasonably able to do it. So,

802
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:31,630
and I believe fundamentally both of
these students in the spectrum exists in

803
00:48:31,631 --> 00:48:34,780
almost everything we touch.
It's just a matter of connecting them.

804
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:39,340
So then that's what we tried
to do in coffee. Great. Well,

805
00:48:39,341 --> 00:48:40,570
thank you so much for coming.

806
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:46,260
[inaudible].
