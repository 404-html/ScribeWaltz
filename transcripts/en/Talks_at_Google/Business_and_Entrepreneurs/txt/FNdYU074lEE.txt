Speaker 1:          00:09          Hi Guys, is this, is this working? Yeah, that's good. Ah, look, delight to be here. It's great to see doctor draw off some free whiskey on a Friday afternoon. It's still gets people interested. So, so delighted to be here. I'm here just to tell you a little bit about who we are, what we're trying to do. Um, and at the same time maybe in part some nuggets of information linkedin to the rich providence and heritage of Dublin and Ireland in, uh, the evolution of, of global whiskey because there's lots of hidden stories and messages that have been lost along the way. And um, we're lucky myself, my brother would just the latest generations of tailings involved in the industry and we're trying to put our own mark on it and we like to say we're respectful to the past, but we're confident that forge in your future boss to do that, you need to know where you've come from.

Speaker 1:          00:57          So, uh, just very, very quickly, people don't know that actually whiskey distillation comes from Ireland's a, it was actually the Irish monks who traveled around the world and they saw in the Middle East and the Mediterranean, uh, the curious process of distillation using a lambic steels, making essential oils, uh, making older v and they took that technology back to Ireland and we didn't have the same crops, but what there was, there was lots of barley and they soon figured out dot. The resulting spirits are illiquid HUD, medicinal values. And, uh, that technology, uh, moved all around the world. And so I went to Scotland and went to everywhere else, but it was very much a mom and pop is very, very small production. So when Larry was, was on farms, um, and really catering for the local community, um, but a couple of different things changed, uh, from the 18th and 19th century.

Speaker 1:          01:46          Our family first started in 1782. I didn't small cross distillery in the city center of Dublin and one of he go to ones and I, an owner, the small distilleries came to giants. I really drove the last golden era for Irish whiskey in the 19th century when Irish whiskey and Dominique is much bigger and Scotch and much bigger than American whiskey. We, dominator in 70% of all global experts came out of the islands of our islands. Um, and there was a reason for that because we had, uh, even back in the 17th, 18th century, a quality reputation was always seen as smooth and very, very drinkable. Um, and uh, one thing happened at the start of the 19th century. It was the act of union with the British empire, which was not so good for the country, but great for Irish whiskey sales. Uh, because all of a sudden it opened up all the markets around the world, uh, to, uh, Irish whiskey and, um, and also led to a lot of foreign direct investment.

Speaker 1:          02:38          So a lot of money came into Ireland. Um, and at that time Dublin was the second richest city in the whole of the British empire. Um, and a lot of money went into whiskey distillation in particular. Um, and because of the industrial revolution, the smaller distilleries could become calm, much bigger. Um, and it was quite interesting in that, and when you think of distillation, you think of rolling hills, you're thinking of locks and all that. In Ireland it was urban, it was in city centers because it was linked to the ports and it could export around the world. So there was very, very different than what was happening in Scotland's. But unfortunately we lost our way. Um, um, I think a success breeds arrogance and we didn't adopt to modern technology. Um, uh, on one or two other things happened in the 20th century, won the war of independence.

Speaker 1:          03:24          Um, uh, which was great again for the country, but dread full of for Irish whiskey sales cause it's so a stowed away all the routes to market that we hods. Um, I'm from the 1930s to the 1990s. Uh, it was a dark day for Irish whiskey cause the last big export market was the u s and they prohibition. So it was like a car crash and we fell off a cliff. Um, um, and a lot of the old brands and a lot of the olds at distilleries slowly slipped away. Uh, and what's interesting and what's unique, uh, really about our city and the city that you guys find yourself. This is the cradle of urban whiskey distillation. Uh, it was here in the city, um, because as I said, it wasn't, these rural distilleries are driving that golden era. It was distilleries in the city center of Dublin and really in the area called the liberties, which was outside of the city wall.

Speaker 1:          04:14          And the reason why it was called the liberties because you're at liberty to do whatever the hell you wanted and was famous for manufacturing. It was a, for breweries, it was for a distilleries was for linen and for four bottles and all so forth. But, uh, uh, the one that stood the test of time was a distilleries and breweries and there was so much production in one square kilometer in the liberties. It was called the Golden Triangle. And it was where majority of the whiskey sold in the last golden era, uh, of Irish whiskey came from. Um, but it was a very dark day in 1976 from the last Dublin distilleries showed the stores, uh, when powers a show, the stores and all the production was consolidated down into worn distillery in cork, in the Middleton distillery. So from the 1976 onwards, all that rich heritage and provenance and all the stories and characters that we're linkedin to making whiskey in our city.

Speaker 1:          05:07          So he slipped away, uh, until recently of, uh, so where are we now? We are in a new golden era for Irish whiskey. I'm Irish whiskey since in 1990s has been the fastest growing spirits category in the world. Um, as a new generation that people discover the joys of Irish whiskey and Irish whiskey because of our climate and the way we make it, it's a little bit lighter, it's a little bit more accessible and it's, it's a perfect gateway, a spirit into whiskey in general. And it's, uh, everything is cyclical. So they say you don't drink what your parents drink, but you might drink what your grandparents drink. Uh, and it's really ours whiskeys, chance to shine. Um, and, uh, it's still only at the early stages of segmentation. For years, there's only been a handful of distilleries. So in 2012, when I set up, there was only four distilleries.

Speaker 1:          05:55          Now there's 20 plus and more coming very quickly behind. So it's going to change. It's going to evolve. It's going to be a proper category with lots of different styles and expression for people to discover it. Um, and, uh, it's, uh, hopefully going to double from where we are now, uh, over the next 10 years. And why is it happening? It's really down to consumer behavior. Consumer, younger people like all your good selves here. Um, um, much more progressive. They don't stick with bronze. They like to discover something new. They want to find something that's relevant, that can connect, um, um, to himself. Um, and they're enjoying whiskey, um, of every kind in different ways. Um, before our Irish whiskey was very much, um, Irish coffees, you know, around the holidays for, you know, uh, Irish American foundries and so forth. But it's changing. It's part of a cocktail.

Speaker 1:          06:44          It's being used and drunk and many different ways. Um, and straight, uh, uh, of course. Um, and, uh, the Asian for like growth is the u s market. Um, so it was a market that put the final nail in the coffin of Irish whiskey a at the start of the 20th century. But it's driving, um, uh, let's say the evolution and the revolution of the category now, um, it's grown by over 600% the last 10 years. Uh, but it's for us, the premiumization at the higher end of the market is the one that's growing very, very fast. But why are people drinking? And I told, said, um, sense of discovery, it's become part of popular culture. Um, but at the core is the taste. People enjoy the taste of Irish whiskey are lonely, miserable, temperate climates is good for one thing. And that's producing, you know, as I say, a soft climate producers are soft whiskey.

Speaker 1:          07:35          But it's true. It's true. Because if you go view, took a distillery that's in our islands and you made the spirit, but you mature that in the highlands of Scotland, or in Kentucky or in Taiwan or in Japan, anywhere else, it will be totally different. The cask and the maturation deliver 60 to 70% of the flavor. And what's distinctive about Irish whiskey is the temperate, soft climate that producers, um, limited, uh, let's say movement of the ward because Oh, costs are porous and they deliver majority of it. So it's environmental influence. So, so when you take of Irish whiskey, it's because of, you know, we don't get to go to the beach too often and we have to, you know, always carry a, a raincoat witness, but it delivers exceptional quality whiskey. Um, and when I set up a, in 2012, um, you know, I had worked in a company called Cudi distillery.

Speaker 1:          08:29          It'd been set up on my father in 1987. Uh, it was the first new distillery in arms over a hundred years. Um, and, uh, we tried to revive a lot of old, famous brands. Um, and I went around the u s and all around the world trying to promote them on ice off myself, the emergence of crafts, spirits, craft beer, people going back into urban centers to try and make things and create brands that were relevant to the people that around there. Um, on the planting the seed in my head. Um, and when my father decided to sell the company he was in in 2011, 2012 and it's beam Suntory to kill beg and Brian went to dam. But it allowed me a chance to take all these little nuggets of information and the things that I really wanted to do and really attack the category in my own way.

Speaker 1:          09:15          And my vision was to bring a more contemporary, more modern, uh, representation of what Dublin and Ireland is, uh, rather than the traditional rolling hills, red setters and all that kind of still for me as a modern owner, didn't really connect me and just kind of like, you know, it's like going to, oh, Carol's gift shop and you see all up how do you stuff it's not real. It's not really what's going on. So I thought that was an opportunity to rep present Arland and Dublin in a modern way and put my own mark on it, but do it in a way that was very relevant to me. And to go right back to where I found the first started, the studying, which just in the city with Dublin, um, and these are the other players. So Pernod Ricard, um, the biggest player by long way, Jameson is a phenomenally success story.

Speaker 1:          10:01          Uh, obviously amazing. Um, but we won't go into that because like you're talking about, uh, William grinds and Sonia they own totem or Jew, they bought out a good few years ago now, but they're the largest privately owned as Scotch whiskey company and the Igo biggest drinks company in the world. You used to own a and was at the time they subsequently flipped it a, I bought a premium Tequila, but they're coming back into it as well. Um, so, so the concept was to do something different and to do something very unique. And that was to, to come back to the city center of Dublin and do it. So, um, as I said, all of that being contemporary, urban, innovative, celebrating my own unique providence and doing something a little bit different. Um, but at the core of it was to get back into production as soon as possible.

Speaker 1:          10:45          Um, but also as we said, whiskey is a very traditional category. You can't treat whiskey like a white spirits like vodka or gin because of all the history and so forth. If you look at all the old bronze or there'd be around for hundreds of years. So you're competing against that and a certain consumer expectations of what it should look like. So, so we see ourselves as the disrupter of Irish whiskey, but at the same time, we're quite, you probably go, yeah, you're quite traditional because that's what people expect. And if you go too far, people actually lose credibility and they think you're overcompensating for something crop in the wall. Um, so, so what we have done is, uh, we are, let's say a celebrating the past. We've gone with the old style dark bottle. Um, it's the way that they would have been able to make last back in the 19th century, early 20th century.

Speaker 1:          11:33          They can't make clear white Flint. They just didn't have the capability to do it. So if you see old bottles, uh, you'll see they're all like this. So I have to go to Italy to find someone that made it, um, but then have a standard label that has, you know, modern cues that people would expect. And our symbolism is fees. A Phoenix rising from the potstill to symbolize the revival of distilling in the city, but also a revival of our family's involvement in the category. And our tagline is the spirit of Dublin. And the reason why we say that the spirit of Dublin, it's not about making alcohol in it. It's trying to capture that unique DNA that makes Dublin the city that it is. It's a bit gritty. He's got his own sense of humor. He's got a school, just got its bad points, but it's very resilient.

Speaker 1:          12:15          Uh, you know, there's a reason why you guys are here is the reason why, um, uh, Google have, uh, the European Middle Eastern headquarters here, it's because of the people and you know, the environment that it creates. And I want to capture that and try and put that into a bottle of whiskey. So that's what the spirit of Dublin means to us. Um, and uh, as you said, we're urban centers through the ages. So a Dava is not what our family does. It really looked like a, what actually happened was our family distillery. We went through a couple of different generations. It got assumed into much larger distillery that was set setup by William Jemison, who was John Jameson song and became the Marble Lane, this theory. So it was the Saudis put a lot smaller. And this is our new distillery today, um, first new distillery in Dublin for over 125 years.

Speaker 1:          13:02          Um, it took me nearly three years to get a bill just for planning reasons and so forth, even though it has all that history and all that, the kind of an old distilleries based around it. And one of the biggest breweries in the world. And Guinness, it's still was exceedingly difficult to get Dublin city council to back me to be able to build a distillery cause they want to move industry. Like manufacturing is dirty manufacturing as they see it out of the city. So it was a fight in her hands, but lucky enough it was worth the effort to get us because it's our brand tone and as you can see is we like to say we fit into the, the, the Palette of materials that are famous around the liberties, but it's a modern or disturbing. You didn't want to create a pastiche kind of, you can't recreate history.

Speaker 1:          13:43          Let's create a new history. And that's more interesting to me and I think that's more interesting for people. And if you come and see us, and that's where we are. Again, new market square where we are is a part of the old parts of the city. It has so much heritage and stories I won't go into today. But, uh, um, our previous family distillery, uh, was up around there, so not too far away. Um, but we're urban prophetess dinners. And when you come to see our distillery, the hero is manufacturing. You actually see a real manufacturing, uh, um, a location. It's not a vis center where the distillery is a distillery would, a visitor center. So it's a medium sized distillery with real people making real whiskey seven days a week, uh, bringing back that smells, the sounds and the environmental experience. And once you see it, it's a very simple process.

Speaker 1:          14:30          It's, we made the same way for hundreds of years, if not thousands of years. Um, um, it's literally makeup hair and then you distill your actually extract impurities, extract water, and you're left with your spirits, which then you have to mature for three years in the day. Um, and what we focus on is being different. So we're small. We're, we're, we're tiny. We're like a, I wouldn't like to say a pimple on a, on the arse of an elephant. We're quite small. Maybe our competitors see us like that bullet. Uh, um, well we want to do was we didn't want to take away, we're not trying to rob volume from the marketing. We're trying to create choice for people. When they want to discover something interesting with it in the category, they can come to us and hopefully we're different. Our liquid is different and we take a lot of pride in the liquid that goes into it because the one thing I learned at an early age was you call it a case of worldclass whiskey.

Speaker 1:          15:24          To get in the game, to win the game, you have to create a world class brand. And we're, we're working on that. We're, we're not there yet, but we wanted to create very, very different tasting whiskeys so that you can have any other brands out there and ours that will stand out and hopefully sign up for the right reasons. Um, what you have to have everything else that goes with it. So, so we have a premium price. Um, um, versus let's say we're in 25, 30% higher than the market leader. We have differentiated packaging and hopefully our story is different as well and bringing it all together. Hopefully we can create something that's, as you say, a little, a little off center. So this is our, our small batch, just as our kind of our flagship product. And the reason why we went with this, because 90% of Irish whiskey sales are blended whisky.

Speaker 1:          16:10          It's a blend of grain and malt whiskey. Grain whiskey is made from corn or maize. It's very light. Um, and blending it with heavier style potstill or single malt makes it more accessible, easier to drink, and it's cheaper as well. Um, so 90% of all our ish whiskey sold is that type and that's what people expect and that's what they get used to it. But we came out a little bit different. We said, well look, let's treat that blended whiskey respect and put an interesting barrels and treat it like it was a single malt and our small batch was born. So we take a grain, a malt whiskey that's been aged four and six years in Bourbon barrels. We blend it together and then we let him marry in Rome barrels for an extra year or so and the parts, this extra layer of flavor and we bottled at 46% or 92 proof.

Speaker 1:          16:57          Um, um, which captures all the natural flavors and so does up that it takes experience, but it tastes like what people expect and they joy already. So, so creating a ladder of different things to get people, um, um, discovering something new and we created a whole range of different expressions and for people. So ranging from our spirits of dove and poaching, which is new, make spirits straight off the still. So, uh, um, it's traditionally very strong. We only bought that 55%, but it's still puts hair on your chest. It doesn't put it on your head. Unfortunately. I've tried many times to our Teeling trinity range, which is a, our small batch. And then we break the individual components into a bottling of single grain whiskey and single malts, again, using very innovative casks to impart a unique flavor. And then we're lucky we have some of the oldest are single malts available and we've created an arrange of different expressions, um, all the way up to a 33 year old, which to me is a piece of arch whiskey history that we're just very lucky to be able to celebrate.

Speaker 1:          18:01          And ties into celebrating the past, but at the same time doing something different. Um, what have you achieved? You know, it's a six years now, so it's a, uh, better than something where now, uh, though we're the fastest growing Irish whiskey domestically, which I think, I think a lot of pride in. So to be a real brand, you've got to be relevant to people on your, in your backyard and put a lot of time and effort in. And Irish whiskey 10 years ago, no one gave it down. It was very much focused on bigger brands. They didn't really want to discover anything else, but it's totally evolved. It's totally changed now. Every bar, every restaurant, it takes pride in their back bar and particularly Irish whiskey are our SGN and everything else that's going on. So, so it's changed a lot, but we're delighted to be part of that evolution and we're exporting to over 60 international markets, but it's like the 80 20 rule, the u s uh, global travel retail, some bigger markets like that, that drives most of our volume.

Speaker 1:          18:57          Um, um, and we'll continue to do so we're seeding in Asia and, um, some emerging markets, but we're in probably a little bit more for when people already know Irish whiskey, getting the one to discover something new. That's where we come in and we've won over 175 international awards, which definitely you take a lot of pride in. Um, um, and, uh, we'll continue to focus on a one bottle at a time and we'd like to say, uh, we put our bottling date on it, uh, and I get to put my signature on it cause I actually have the, the, the rice to joy, the obligation to sign off every batch before we do it. So it sounds great, but you had a, let's say a busy weekend and you come in on a Monday morning and we're like, oh, we have to bottle taste this and you're drinking costume.

Speaker 1:          19:37          Whiskey can sense a lot more romantic than it actually is. Um, but it's still, it's still, it's still not a bad job, so I can't complain, but I do, I could play it all the time. Um, and, uh, we've had over 300,000 visitors. True. Um, which is amazing, which is great because we don't have money for global advertising budgets. What we want is that experiential marketing, so people to call them and experience us, meet the people, young, passionate people we have working for us, um, understand what we're all about and then take that home with them no matter where they are in the world. So, uh, it's a key thing and that was part of the reason we have to fight together distillery because we wanted that experience side of, of, of, of the business as well. Um, and you'll be delighted to know, um, I'm talking a lot about the small batch and, and I'll talk a little bit the Ciliary, we have some free passes and some whiskeys there for you guys to take with you so you can really experience what we're all about as well.

Speaker 1:          20:31          Um, and where are we now? In 2018, um, since I started coming to the category is doubled. Well if nearly doubled, um, segmentations accelerating, um, and what we had before and we were limited by supply going forward from where we are now, it's going to be limited by demand. So it puts a lot more onus on us to to let's say a perfect our digital marketing and odor to is that we can leverage to connect and tell our story in a meaningful way to our target demographic. Uh, on our glue. Our goal for the next three to four years is to really be that global discovery, Irish whiskey driving the premiumization of Irish whiskey. Not trying to be the next Jansen or [inaudible] or anything like that is really helped the category evolve and to give that choice so that when you go, no matter where you go in the world, rather it one bottle of Irish whisky, you'll see a range of Irish whiskey.

Speaker 1:          21:23          And that's the opportunity. That's the challenge. At the same time, um, and it's getting more challenging because this is what's happening and there's definitely a revolution going on. There's no shortage of entrepreneurship in our own. That's the one thing I can definitely say is that everyone sees the opportunity. I'm not sure if they're all going to be able to grasp it or not. So the ones in the red where the regional distilleries, when I settle, when I set up with that were there, the ones in the green are the ones that are there. Um, um, um, now, and the ones in the black are some of the ones, there's even more that are going to come up. So it's always very exciting. It's very noisy. Um, hopefully if everyone focused on doing something a little bit different, a little bit more interesting and embrace their own story and location, the future looks very, very bright. So Shinay

Speaker 2:          22:10          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          22:17          am I on track? Got Y'all on the head. Is Roxhill loads. Question. So,

Speaker 4:          22:22          so Jack, thank you so much for coming. This has been like a very interesting talk that I've witnessed the spite of the talks at Google team. Um, and we're talking about whiskey. But my, my first question, my very serious first question is, have you ever been drunk on Teeling whiskey? I would you recommend the experience?

Speaker 3:          22:40          Oh my gosh. Well, I can tell you my first experience with whiskey was not the best. Um, uh, you know, was it because he wasn't dealing with the problem with people who don't maybe know whiskey and how they drink it is that if you try and drink it like wine or beer, you'll drink it too fast. Um, um, you have to drink in a different way. So you sip it, you appreciate it. So if you're doing it too fast, it will hit you like a steam train unforeseen. When I was growing up, no one told me that. Uh, and uh, yeah, I can really knock your socks off. I know we're all about drinking less and drinking better. So, um, it's a, it's, it's about more flavor, more character and enjoying and appreciating the whiskey rahter than drinking it just to get drunk. But the medicinal benefits of it are a very relaxing, it's good to have, especially after a hard week and work like, you know, let's go wait to, to unwind.

Speaker 3:          23:36          Yeah. Yeah. So it's about drinking less, but drinking better. Yeah. Yeah. You know, so that's very philosophical for whiskey. Now. Uh, well it's, it's not, it's, it's happened a lot in different categories. It's happened, but it's a tequila. It's good. It used to be always just a shot. Um, part of the experience of, you know, I wouldn't say college experience for people. Um, now it's, you know, you're look at Petroleum Tequila, it's, it's all about understanding the current effort. It goes into creating the products and if you understand that you'll appreciate it a little bit more in your drinking in a different way as well.

Speaker 4:          24:10          Thank you. So you definitely recommend, um, I just wanted to know, so

Speaker 3:          24:15          I definitely recommend drinking tea rescue, but not too much that, uh, you make per life decisions. Okay.

Speaker 4:          24:22          Um, I'm really curious. I have a question for you as a CEO. Um, if you could describe for us your worst or your best day in business while without being,

Speaker 3:          24:33          she's tough. Question. Uh, yeah. Well, uh, um, I'm lucky that we've had some key landmark, um, days along the journey. Um, um, um, we're going this year, 2018 is a key landmark a year for, for, for us as a whiskey distillery because it's three years in a day. Um, and before you can legally sell it. So, so we're actually bottling up our very first release of our Teeling single potstill, which will be coming available later in the year or so. So it's amazing to have just a concept that you've had floating around in your head to actually, you know, build this, um, lay it down and let it mature over that period of time and then see it come to life. Um, so, uh, this year is a, is a, is a big year for us, but also it's like the original five year business plan has, has, has, let's say, happened and now we have to reinvigorate yourself and go again.

Speaker 3:          25:25          So all of the things you want to do and it's again, you know, just sitting back, you know, how have a range of all of our whiskeys win awards, do all that kind of stuff like that. We've done that. So how would you refire the organization to aspire to something bigger? Again, a uneven myself. Um, um, um, that's, this was a, a key challenge in terms of bonds, um, and days. Um, I always find that the worst thing is around people and sometimes, you know, the challenge that's human resources can happen. So, um, you know, some bad decisions or how did hiring and you know, to be negative for the company and so forth and creating, you know, not the type of environment for staff that you want. Um, and there were some of the, the the worst times for us, but that's just normal in an organization. Um, but still I'm lucky is by far like, you know, it's like I struggle sometimes to say like, what was your worst decision or what's the worst day hike for you? I don't think of how to yet. Um, um, uh, but it's been a real positive ions, a enjoyable experience for me so far.

Speaker 4:          26:26          Um, my, my next question is around legacy. Um, so you're running a company that has had a lot of history, a lot of family history, but at the same time you're running it in the 21st century where things are changing very rapidly. Um, so how have you been able to marry the, with the contemporary, so retaining your, your core identity, but then also adapting it for the, you know, for, for the young games like us,

Speaker 3:          26:52          I'm not that old. I used to say our target demographic was 21 to 35 now is it has to be 21 to 45, like, you know, so, um, but, um, um, I suppose in any kind of business where your, your name is on the ball, hello are, you know, it's gone through lots of different generations. There's a lot of pressure on ownership on you to represent him the right way, not screw up. Um, ours is a little bit different in that, you know, it's really a kind of revival of the trademark and the history. Um, um, so we're a little bit more, that's a, uh, not as, uh, hampered by some of the legacy issues. But water we're trying to do is when people think of Teeling or they hear the name, think the old, like the whiskey, you know, so that's where we want to go.

Speaker 3:          27:44          And uh, you know, I think, uh, our, our, our wider family, which is quite a small achieving is unusual. Arash name actually came from a vikings. Norman's Sooni came to Ireland's many years ago. There's more teamings in Hollins than anywhere else, which I only found out once I set up the company and they all kept phoning up asking for a free bottles of whiskey. So, uh, um, but, uh, no, I think a, it's a, it's an amazing opportunity that I've been given, um, to, to quote our mark back on dope. It was, um, you know, hopefully it can go through a couple of different generations and carry on that legacy too to make sense.

Speaker 4:          28:22          And my final question, so if you have a question, just get ready. Um, my final question is, when you were speaking, you said that, um, two dates, you've had about 300,000 visits us at the distillery. That's a lot of people. Um, and you also said something around digital marketing and trying to, you know, adapt for the digital age. So really quick question. Do you have an ad words account? Yes. Okay.

Speaker 3:          28:49          Oh yeah. Yeah. It's a, it's a, it's a key. Um, um, I'm just joking, but it is because the hardest thing is, is in our industry, there's so many. We don't have our own distributors, so, you know, we have distributors, independent servers around the world. Um, it's sometimes like Chinese whispers about you're telling your story, you say it to them and they kind of go, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, you, I understand. They, they've no idea what you're talking about. And then they tell their sales guys who didn't tell us the Barmah new tells then to consumer and they kind of lose that impact. So, you know, modern digital communication, cultural, all the noise. So someone on their phone and find you on, hopefully you understand what your product is on that and what your brands,

Speaker 4:          29:31          thanks for pitching adwords, but I'm going to use that in my next client meetings. Um, so are there questions from the, Oh, perfect.

Speaker 3:          29:40          I'm the best question. Got a big one. So no pressure.

Speaker 5:          29:48          Um, since we're here at Google, I want to know like, which is your favorite youtube channel talking about whiskey. And one last thing, what do you think about Conor McGregor? Snoop

Speaker 3:          29:57          proper tall, probably the first one is a guy called Ralphy. Uh, I don't know if you know Rafi. He's a, he's a serious character, um, on, um, he's been doing it for a long time. He always, you must be out of for, you know, way before, you know, the, the modern and interesting in online reviews. And he's very independent as well. He's Scottish, which is a bit of an issue. Um, so he is this a war few Irish whiskey, but you know, I, I enjoy, uh, the way he does his tasting. Do you remember your score? Uh, um, we've got a couple. Um, I think we did reasonably okay on the small batch. I think he likes the older expressions. They are seeing the multiple baker he gives good Switzerland. So, um, then Conor McGregor, it's kind of very, it was interesting when they was, uh, uh, because he sent in his negotiator to us, a couple of, uh, I would say maybe two years ago ago, I thought our Tam and, Oh Beth, who is the Russian Hower, he's a MMA fighter as well, but he is, uh, a friend of, of Connor on day.

Speaker 3:          30:58          He was looking at getting supply whiskey, real negotiator, you'll really go share. I was 40 years cause he had no clothes on his hand. And then he was like, oh, he's starting small. Like, Yo, you're like, oh they kill, maybe I can take them. And I said, not a challenge. And uh, he just finished a business degree so he was going around and do, so Connor has had an interest for awhile. We pitched and idea of doing a very limited high end kind of boring for him, but he wanted something that was a little bit more entry level, um, to kind of, uh, you know, gosh or wider opportunity. And it was something we couldn't do. Um, and his launch just being for the home, like, you know, it's a, it's, it's the definitely generated a lot of interest. Um, I, I, I'd be interested to see how that interest in teens over the weekends, you know, but, uh, I was in a taxi and he's an MMA fighter, the taxi driver, and he said guaranteed going to knock it out in the first round. And so, uh, he's putting his own money on it, so, uh, it could be an extra kick for her first Muskie, but I think more people talking about Irish whiskey. It's good. Um, um, on, you know, cause it's still at the early stages I'll definition, but we do something that's quite different. And Connor,

Speaker 5:          32:00          hi. Thanks. First for your presentation, really engaging or question around this distillery on what you're producing in there. So I've been to this distillery in new market. It's very impressive. Setup. The merchandise store, not like the party like, or Carlos you mentioned. Um, but you mentioned that you showed us an Irish family of whiskeys and one of them, my soul was the poaching. Um, so actually went to the launch of this and it was paired with poachers, an Irish gin to thought it was really great that you're supporting iris business. Where do you see this in terms of your target, Marcus, and how can this become like a, a drink, like a cocktail or we're poaching or just whiskey in Jerry w with poaching.

Speaker 3:          32:37          Yeah, we'll put, Geez, I've been interested in pushing for a long time because it is, everyone in our islands has some story about new, mostly not code. We're poaching a, it always comes out on special occasions, weeks or you know, a stags or all this kind of stuff like that. Or someone has a bottle somewhere underneath the ad. The cadre are under the counter in the seven up or whatever sort of bottle. Uh, and I always thought it was great opportunity to represent it in a more modular, um, but it's hard because people don't, I have to drink and it's a bit of a novelty because it's so strong and the, you're competing as odor, you know, a white spirits. We had vodka or anything else. Um, um, so it's, it's a difficult one. And, uh, you know, we've tried it and it's part of what the portfolio, but it's so much money would go into changing consumer behaviors and education that for us it's nice to have for our real opportunity is on whiskey, which people already understand that the already, you know, it's a global opportunity and there's one or two guys like Mikell, um, uh, which is a Golway, which is, that's what he does.

Speaker 3:          33:45          He's a pushy maker. Um, and uh, you know, I think he's trying to do some good things as well, but I think it will be in cocktails, um, and understanding, you know, maybe a signature drink that poaching can live in to really give it so, but it's up against, you know, gene, uh, which is, you know, again, it's gone crazy. Um, but, uh, um, I, you know, I'd like to see a future because we have a GI who, so it's a geographically protected terminology that's solely from our own, so it's there to be exploited. But I would like to see and figure company probably do a lot of the heavy lifting to get it to where it needs to be.

Speaker 6:          34:21          Thank you. Um, my question is about how do you start to, how do you revive the a distillery? Presume presuming that you need to have a whiskey has been aged for 12 years or 15, maybe even 25 and I know you're selling some 25 year old whiskeys and then in the same way, how do you deal with competition? How do you anticipate that people who are kids today are going to love your whiskey in 10 or 15 years and that some other distillery is not going to come up, come out to, it's something revolutionary that you couldn't, you know, deal with later. For example, I was thinking how Japan entered the whiskey market in 2010 or 2014 out of the blue and now they're kind of leading it, getting the rewards. How do you deal with that?

Speaker 3:          35:02          Yeah, I said no tough questions. Like how, how would you have whiskeys and you're only a new distillery? Um, um, that's a very good question. And I was the managing director in Cooney, uh, uh, when it was old. I wasn't happy with it as being sold. So I was a little bit problematic and like demanded supply contract to be able to stay within the industry, which they gave. Uh, which was great. So there's no noncompete, um, allowed me to get back into the category. Um, and uh, in 2012 and 13, when opportunity came to buy, you know, a big chunk of imagery which we acted on. Um, so we knew quite well, but what we focused on is changing and making a difference on by using innovative cost maturation to bring that extra flavor onto, I suppose where we're coming now. It was full circle where, where, uh, replacing that source whiskey would our own whiskey now, uh, now allows us to be truly innovative and doing things differently.

Speaker 3:          35:59          Um, in terms of, you know, when we settle, where were you producing whiskeys? I mean like people would like, uh, I suppose we were our target demographic. Oh, you like it was an eerie, the group that was involved with opening the city. We sat around and said, well, what did we find it interesting? You know, what we like if we like and we hope whether people like it. So we're the toughest critics, but we make whiskeys, we like to drink and hope for the older people like to drink it as well. Uh, I go forward. How can we keep it relevant? How we keep it exciting, but innovating if you're asking me. And uh, so we're laying down whiskeys, you know, peated whiskey, smoky whiskies, a rye whiskeys, lots of different styles so that hopefully we can respond to consumer interests for different things. Um, but it's good. It's global. People make whiskey everywhere. Japanese whiskeys is amazing. Uh, Taiwanese whiskies are amazing. Australian whiskies, you know, everywhere. So I think it's, people are more interested what's in the fall, you know, rather than necessarily a, to be from a certain country. So it puts more pressure, but also opens up a lot of opportunities because Irish whiskey is still quite small. It used to be only scotch, Scotch, Scotch, Scotch. Now it's, everyone is, is open to trying different things.

Speaker 7:          37:10          So a lot of Whiskey, uh, ends up getting, um, around 45% proof. Um, there have been some really interesting products that, uh, typically higher improves. So 50, 60% cost drinks. Yep. Um, can you talk a little bit about how that might be in a potential direction for you or uh, as, uh, just industry in general?

Speaker 3:          37:33          Yeah, yeah. I think, um, um, a lot of American whiskeys will be quite high in alcohol. Um, and that's again, because of the maturation. So because they mature in very hot climates, the actually rather than in Ireland's where you lose alcohol into the atmosphere, um, uh, use alcohol, it's called the angel share. It's our profit going up in the air. So the smell you guys, uh, at a whiskey warehouse is actually alcohol disappearing into, into Asia. What does that environmental influence them, you know, makes whiskey what it is. Um, so in hotter climates it goes up rather than it goes down. And so the longer you have it in, wouldn't our owns the lower the alcohol strands in America and Taiwan? It goes, it goes off. Uh, but I think also people want to have a four or flavor, a stronger flavor. And I think people's pile is gonna evolve.

Speaker 3:          38:22          And we do a lot of single cast bottling's. Um, you can come to our distillery, fill a single cost record from the casket, and uh, it could be anywhere from 62% all the way down to, you know, we bottled a 34 year old on was at 43.1%. That was the actual cost rent. We agile itself. So it just depends if, and what we'd like to do is cater for a full range of tastes. Um, and when you have a costume, you can add water to it to get into it. You know? So what all are whiskeys are signature is 46%. And the reason why we do it on is because if you bottle it 40%, which is the legal limits, that's the lowest. It's obviously cheaper too. So, but you also have to do a process. It's called chill filtration because if you don't do that, uh, if you get it from hot to cold, you get this clouding.

Speaker 3:          39:05          And little bits of a asters and fatty acids. Coagulating and so you go, Geez, what's floating in my whiskey? Um, but if you bought it at a higher alcohol strand, you can keep them in. So we're trying to keep, bring more flavor in our view is why would you take those naturally occurring flavors? I was cause they give it a lovely [inaudible] so, so we're, we're all over the US and uh, uh, one of our uh, um, our Bravo's involving, which is a single mall boffing again, we picked 49 and a half percent alcohol because it delivered the best tape off I floss.

Speaker 8:          39:36          Hi. Thank you. Um, my question is actually related to m trans in new product development. So, uh, you've touched upon the competition and that the big brand I tried to steal within the category, but what's also happening is cross category, um, major manufacturers and small brands competing in coming up with great ideas. Like in the UK they've invented the Collagen based gym, which is as it was indeed. Yes. I'm wondering what is happening in the whiskey do because it's quite traditional in terms of taste. Are there any crazy or interesting ideas coming around?

Speaker 3:          40:18          Well, because it's such an old industry and there's lots of rules and regulations, so you have to operate within. What's interesting in Ireland, um, is, uh, the rules, the regulations say a hostile, you matured in wooden barrels for three years in a day to be legally called Irish whiskey. Um, what if you go to Scotland? It's old crowns. So what you're seeing now is people that are using different types of woods, do you try and impart extra favor? So chess, most acacia, cherry wood, we even have experimented with Brazilian hardwood sustain and be far as, um, and it's, you know, it's weird. It's just a weird thing cause it's like, it just tastes like you have a grand piano when you put your nose into it. It's like a pace like that. Don't ask me how, but I was really weird. Boy. Yo, you can do dot.

Speaker 3:          41:05          Well it's, or you can, what? We are doing a lot of collaboration with other spirits producers, be proper Reese, uh, order, uh, spirit producers. So we've used at Casa would have been used for a Aquavit, uh, for Jim, for, uh, vamoose, um, for a craft beer, um, for anything you can imagine. Um, and you can do it because that imparts a certain flavor, incent borrow that you can then extract it into whiskey. You kind odd any flavorings and take on nothing like natural feelings or anything like that otherwise can't be classified as whiskey, but you can basically use a wooden vessel. Dot. Has been used to age and mature or something else. And we do a lot with different types of wines and stuff like that. So, so we're innovating where we can't and also you can innovate how you are, um, what raw materials you use and even the stranger users. So we're using a combination of white wine, yeast and traditions, the synergies to produce a very flavorsome, um, um, these, um, that you make your spirit form.

Speaker 9:          42:06          Um, okay. So you mentioned, um, how your challenges so far have been supply base like challenges, but then now moving more to the demand side. So I'm guessing that, um, you are thinking about how to am increased demand and one way to do that is by scaling globally. So how do you, I'm just curious, how do you maintain a local brand and make that good global? Like how do you stay Quinn's essentially Irish and chew to your heritage? Like, cause this is a business that has been inherited, right? So how do you stay true to that while I'm having a global appeal?

Speaker 3:          42:46          Yeah, it's a, it's a very good question. Uh, uh, we'd probably be like here, you guys know local type of approach in terms of, uh, what we do here in Dublin. Uh, the different things we do to try to engage your local communities and we try and foster cymbre type of behavior from our importers around the world to bring the brand to life. Um, um, so, uh, you know, at the core we are definitely Arash I'm worth Dublin. And sometimes when you go around the world, they don't understand. [inaudible] you know, was dumb. I'm like, you know, they, you know, you go to, uh, um, New York and they still think there's like donkeys going through the reading.

Speaker 3:          43:26          So it's a challenge. It is a challenge, um, on, you know what, it's easy if you live here until understand, you know, what the city is like, um, to try and capture that in an emotive way and to bring that internationally. It's, it's, it's a challenge. And I wouldn't say we practice what we're, we're working on this. What we do is we have ours people that we send around the world to represent the bronze to bring it to life. Brian Fosters a whiskey warriors is and be like to call them because they're at the coalface fighting to go bottle to spread the gospel of all team meetings, TV. And that's going into probably the right type of accounts, uh, where people take pride in what they sell, they want to, to learn and then they can tell your story for you. So, so, um, it's, it's, it's an ongoing battle,

Speaker 10:         44:12          intriguingly, purchasing whiskey to being driven by investment decision rather than for consumption. And like couple of days ago there was an article going viral, but the Macklin selling for nearly a million euro. Yeah. I was wondering for people like us who can hold whiskey for Niger for 30, 40 years at least, uh, what sort of recommendation would you have in terms of what type of risk we should be purchased?

Speaker 11:         44:37          You also disclosures

Speaker 10:         44:41          just to relate back to your companies. Are there any specific type of a Teeling whiskey though? Maybe we should, or you would envisage like surging and praise going forward?

Speaker 3:          44:51          Uh, I, I always encourage people to at least buy two bottles so they can drink one o'clock. The other one. But the core of our range, we make risky used to be drunk. Whiskey is for me, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's joy. It's social boy open and drink it. And we positioned our core range so that it wouldn't got her dose than people's, uh, drinks cabinet. It was, you know, it's, it's an affordable option. So at the core, that's what we're all about. Uh, what as a category, um, uh, Irish whiskey is, is, is booming. It's growing ahead of everyone's expectation. So the ability to, to sell older expressions is going to become more limited. You know, as more and more collectors come in, then the, the, there's going to be a high appreciation. And what we're seeing is a lot of interest in the newer distilleries like tingle in order, things like that.

Speaker 3:          45:42          People are just buying to sell on and it seems to be working. But is it a house of cards? Any sentence, three children and he's going to implode. I don't know. Um, but, uh, I think anything that has, it's like a bit of liquid history. Um, um, on some of the older expressions I would expect and I can't guarantee that they should appreciate and value as more and more collectors come into the category as the, as, as it gets bigger. So it's still at the early stages. I remember five, 10 years ago, no one really collected Irish whiskey. Now you go online and there's massive communities that are all talking about it, but it's still small rounds at the Scotch or jumping knees. Um, and I was, uh, we auctioned off our very first release from the distillery on whiskey option here, like Hamas Scottish one.

Speaker 3:          46:25          And we did it because he wants me to achieve the highest price so we can give all the proceeds back to local charities and so it gives something back. Um, and our bottom number one, which is a tree year old whiskey sold for 10,000 pounds starting, which I thought was great, but um, on average the, they went for six and her parents as well. But that's a once off never to were faces are commercial release of our single potstill will be coming out in October, November of Botswana. Uh, will be price, hopefully reasonably in offering a 50, 55 year olds. So again, drinkable. Um, but uh, if you were to put away a bottle, I did recommend that one. Yeah.

Speaker 10:         47:04          Thank you so much Jack. I never knew like coming to whiskey Sakata Kuwait and nuggets for life. Drink less, drink better. How have your yeah, I'm so do less. Do Better. Yeah, just anything less do it better.

Speaker 11:         47:17          I cannot choose. You asked the best question. You don't have to be.

Speaker 12:         47:27          Thank you.
