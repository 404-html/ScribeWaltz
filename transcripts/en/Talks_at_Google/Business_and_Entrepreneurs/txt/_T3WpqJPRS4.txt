Speaker 1:          00:05          So Lou, maybe tell us about your journey in early Korea in corporate and why you mix a decision to jump. So yeah. So, hi everyone. I'm so happy to be here. Um, last time I was here, I was in my role as a mentor for Google Launchpad, so I'm very excited to be back, um, to give you a little bit of background about my past and professional life. Um, so as shelter and I'm trying to ease and um, and when you grow up as a Chinese child, you have a lot of expectations, you know, from your family at that you need to fulfill, to have, um, you know, a good life, um, or to be deemed successful. So my parents always wanted to meet to Amino, be go either into business or into law or into, uh, into medicine. Right. And, um, so I chose business and the business called in Germany. So I was born in China and then grew up in Germany, but all my education in Germany went to business school. I'm in Germany on star with Mckinsey in Munich almost 10 years ago, nine years ago, Asian genes.

Speaker 1:          01:11          And, um, and yeah, so I started with working with Mckinsey, then moved onto drunk, um, P and g and, um, work in Switzerland in brand management and marketing. And I've done that for about five, four or five years in total. And then I sort of jumped, uh, and uh, you know, just kind of became my own person, if that makes sense. Um, kind of embarked on this part on the, of, of being an entrepreneur and I'm trying to find out what I want to do on my own. And the reason for that, um, to lots of the question actually is I don't think you ever actually leave a company. I think you leave a manager think about that. Um, and in my case, you know, it was kind of, um, you know, I, I had difficulties with a buzzer was reporting to. Um, I also saw that he had difficulty, so boss that he was reporting to.

Speaker 1:          02:02          So if you can all think about the whole sort of reporting chain, it just doesn't, but it basically work out and he was like, oh my God, this is a dead end. And, uh, you know, I was, it was not possible basically for me to maneuver in any way in that sort of situation. And I just basically had to leave the company to kind of like find something new and I as I thought, okay, I'm, you know, I need to remove myself. I'll just situation too. I want to join another corporate or do I take the opportunity to do something on my own. And uh, that was five years ago, um, and I decided to do something on my own because I'm one of these people who think I can do things better than other papers and the, yeah. So I'm back on, on that journey.

Speaker 1:          02:43          Yeah. Do you ever wish you could like maybe quit earlier or like Lucy said, exactly. Good timing for you to do so. I think it was the, it was the right time, I think. I don't think there's ever, like, I suppose I'm the best time to leave a job. Right. You feel it. I mean, you know, when you offer straight it enough and in my case, you know, you'll do it, or if there's a big enough other opportunity, um, that lures you in, then you'll do it. Right. I think, um, every decision that you know, people make, then, you know, it's, it's kind of like if it's comes from the heart, it's kind of like you're fully like behind it, then it is the the right time for you. Right. And for me it was definitely the right time. I don't think, um, I should have done it earlier or later.

Speaker 1:          03:26          So I don't regret that. I sort of trumped, um, you know, five years ago. Um, I think what I would say though is because I was in Switzerland, I was actually in Germany as an expert and then I'll move back to Switzerland and it was, I was not really part of the entrepreneurial ecosystem because there was none. Um, I think knowing that, you know, sort of being in London and having so many things around you, I think it's definitely helpful to immerse herself even while you're employed in these activities. I mean we, you know, run a lot of things also over the weekends, events and all of that. So I think that's one thing I would have. Um, I wished I would have had, but I didn't hide it, I think at the time. So there was no choice. Cool. And after you create, do naturally directly go to entrepreneurship or you take some time to figure out what you want to do.

Speaker 1:          04:13          And how long did that take? So, I mean, I left with the vision to do something on my own. I didn't know what I want to do. Um, I just, I suppose, wanted to do something I love, which is my strength and, uh, do something that, you know, I'm passionate about and I love. Right. And I think that's what a lot of people think about when this of, you know, quit a job. And, um, and then it's about actually sort of finding, finding out whether the idea that you have is a viable business or can be a viable business. And it's also a business that you want to actually build. Because, you know, if you're working for a big company, you have all the infrastructure, you know, that, that you can dream of, right? I mean, you know, buildings and food and the assistants and telephones and all of these things that you have to take off yourself and your work for you, for yourself.

Speaker 1:          04:56          Right? And, and people find out that you know, you, you like certain things or you are better at certain things than others. And uh, so before I started blooming founders, I had two other companies which I run by myself also almost as a one woman show. And I learned through that process. I took that for about three years, was two and a half years, um, that I don't want to build a company that just has me as one person, right? Because obviously you can trade your time for money and then you know, you can just kind of consult on in a capacity and you know, you can pay your rent, you can pay your expenses. And that's kind of it. But I just realized by doing that, that after a while that I had, you know, the ambition or this, you know, I wasn't satisfied myself, so I wanted to build something bigger and more sustainable with more impact and uh, that I couldn't have known in the beginning.

Speaker 1:          05:51          It's kind of, I think, you know, if you're, you know, taking the leap and then trying to find out what you want to do, I think it's a very, very natural that you're doing different things, trying different projects and find out what works for you and what doesn't work for you. Um, yeah, so it takes time. Okay. And how does a book idea, Kamala, before you answer, I just wanted to ask, um, outings and question, how many of you guys do right hand writing letters to anyone around the world? Just hands out of your, she'll still do that to families. To friends? Yeah. Nice. Um, we'll keep a journal Journal, like how many people write to themselves a bit more. I wonder like do they write to me in English or in your mother tongue? Like native language? It's quite intimate to write a letter to someone.

Speaker 1:          06:43          So how does the idea come around for you? So the book idea is kind of, it was one of the first project I released for those of under my new company blooming founders. I started completely, I mean, you know, sort of from scratch, the idea was to kind of build an infrastructure for female founders because as I was out there doing stuff on my own, I realized that a lot of other women are out there doing stuff on the, on their own. And then if you're in the startup ecosystem, you'll see no women. So you kind of like cried to square up like what's happening here. Right. And, and it seems to me that there's a lot of women around, but you know, there's no infrastructure that they, they go to apparently. And I didn't know why that was happening. So I started, um, uh, you know, running events, bringing women together that are entrepreneurial, uh, inviting female founders, speakers and you know, sort of doing talks and it's exactly what, what you are doing, um, with 90% women and the other.

Speaker 1:          07:37          Then I actually, I'm so glad that we have a lot of guys in here. I'm really, really good because obviously, you know, the title was there a female founders, so you know, wasn't expected. So yay guys. Um, so coming back to, to the, the, the, the story. Um, so yeah, so I started doing events and at this event you obviously network and after, after the event and um, you find out over time that you know, that there are no role models, are very little few role models that women have in entrepreneurship that the media talks about the typical sort of people such as Elon mass, such as Mark Zuckerberg, such as, you know, Larry Page and all of these people are all great people, but there are not us. Like it's just different, you know, it's not the same. And um, and this book came about from my view of, I think there's so many amazing women out there, cause I've had them speak at my events that, you know, we didn't need to share more content and we also need to share more authentic content.

Speaker 1:          08:39          Um, not me going out and interviewing people, which I could have done, but another train journal, I don't even know what to ask. Basically. I can answer questions, but you know, um, so that's why I came up with the idea of writing a letter because I think it's kind of, it's quite a powerful tool. Yeah. Um, and also it digs out, you know, pass it insights from those entrepreneurs that they probably would have never been prompted by a journalist. Right. Because who knows what's in your head. Right. So, yeah. So that's the long story to how this came about. And when you collecting all this success, six different letters from the female founders, is there any particular one like you, like most impress you the most or something? You never expect it as a question? Ask a lot. So there are 66 letter in that book, so there's quite a few, um, amazing women.

Speaker 1:          09:32          And so they have that, that got featured and I have several favorites was different reasons. And I think, you know, people that are just super practical and a, and just kind of like, you know, just when you read this, you go, oh my God, you the, of course, you know, like should I should do this, you know, and then people that are a bit more reflective and uh, and it takes a bit longer to process basically. And sometimes, you know, I mean even I had to like read, I mean I had to read cause I edited the whole thing, but I had to read letters several times to, and I wanna understand what, what, you know, what's behind. And, uh, so yes, I mean I do have my, my favorite letters, um, for different reasons I think. And um, if you probably sort of, I mean I can probably say like the first one of each chapter, I have three larger sections in the book.

Speaker 1:          10:22          Probably the first one that I put is, was kind of like one of the favorites. And the last one is quite powerful as well actually. Yeah. Cool. Can't wait to read the whole book. I think you guys probably thinking the same. Um, and when you, when you funding your business, do you find this at wise give you, um, good reason to hold down to, uh, have you ever experienced some of the failures or, um, time and how do you cope with the yeah, I think that his business reality, right? I mean, if anybody thinks that, you know, when you started your own business, there's going to be eight to be like, forget it. He's not going to happen. So I mean, there's naturally up and downs and, um, and then, you know, I mean, I think sort of rooting all of these articles and letters.

Speaker 1:          11:07          I think there's just, you know, a lot of things that, that is very real. And I think, you know, just one of the things, I mean there's just springs to mind, but don't work with idiots. Yeah. I mean, nobody tells you that, but don't work with idiots. Very simple. And, and it's, you know, I say it's simple, but it's actually not, because sometimes you aren't in situations where you have to work with people that you actually don't like, for example. And then, you know, it's, it can drag a lot of energy and time out of view. Um, and sometimes, you know, like the boldest move you can actually make this actually stop working with these people, even if you have to say no to money. Right. Um, and cash flow is obviously important, um, always. Um, but sometimes it's just very deliberating not, not to work with certain people.

Speaker 1:          11:50          Um, and, uh, and I know that from the community and obviously I produced the book for the blooming founders community. I know that some people have it next to their bedside table and then, you know, when they have like a shitty day, then you know, oh, can I swear actually, I don't know. I'm the one they had like a bad day. They will sort of dip into the book and then they would sort of be motivated again and said, etc. Um, because you know, life happens. That's true. Um, so when you, on your entrepreneurial journey, there's, do you have mentors? Do you have like good mentor that mentor? And how do you know at that time that's a, it was for you. How do you know it? So I think, I believe, I mean, if you don't know, I think it's good to just type this into a lot of a pin, different opinions.

Speaker 1:          12:34          Um, and then you had to just make yourself like make up your mind yourself. Basically you have what you listened to and, and just aligned with your gut. Like who do you trust most? Right? And you know, cause most of the time you asked, I mean, don't listen to people who tell you something and you actually find out that I've never done it themselves. Right? I mean, we know too many of those people and there's a lot of mentors and advisors also in the startup world that have never done anything themselves, but then they, you know, are going around and advising people. Right. And, um, um, so that, be careful about, um, and over time I think, you know, the good mentors and advisors, they would actually sort of follow up with you, um, because they like you and they really want to support you.

Speaker 1:          13:18          So with most of my current mentors, I wouldn't even call them mentors because we almost became friends. Right? I mean, I have everyone on whatsapp and if I have any questions basically, right. I just basically ping them a message and then, you know, I see what they say and then I think, oh, this makes sense. This doesn't make sense. Or, you know, and then I just move on. Cool. Um, I think I raised a research or another interview date. There's, in UK there's around 75% of the female founder. They're also solo founders, so they don't have cofounder and all by themselves. Um, what do you think can be done to change the reality or what caused that and what things we can do? So I think the reason expands is probably not that easy to explain. I mean, there's multitudes of, of of things. I mean there's research, for example, that women in business and in general have a smaller network but a deeper network and men and business have a water network and more shallow network, which means that they know the space, the more people.

Speaker 1:          14:19          And then societal lead also men tend to not shy away from is picking up the phone and call up a mate to ask them a favor or to ask him to do something. Whereas women tend not to do that basically because they're aware it's risky and I don't really want to drag another friend into like the whole thing before they are 100% certain. It's perfect and it's totally, you know, you know, safe to do, which obviously is never is. And um, yeah, so I think, you know, a lot of women in the community to me as you know, um, our solo founders because they choose that path of x, y that reason could be because they were frustrated in the previous job because they're really passionate about, you know, this idea that they have. But they are, they at that time when they had the idea, there was nobody else around that was similarly passionate or that they knew for long enough to kind of be a cofounder.

Speaker 1:          15:13          Yeah. But then, you know, sort of people venture out and then they try to find a cofounding team and that becomes really difficult as well because you don't obviously know the people and then, you know, people might take advantage of you and all of these things. So I think it's a multitude of reasons why women tend to build businesses on their own. Um, set this though, you know, I mean, luckily we still have, um, you know, women founding teams, the no mixed teams as well that built great businesses. But I think the overall sort of landscape is, unfortunately, I'm still that way and I hope through the, you know, the work that we do. So we recently opened, um, the physical space, a physical work and events space called Bloom's London. So it's a coworking space slash event space slash members club. And I think the members club element comes through bringing the community together.

Speaker 1:          16:05          Right. I'm connecting you with other women, um, that do, you know, I see similar things in business but have different businesses, um, and you can collaborate and then, you know, you can form teams that might not be sitting on the one company but at least are sort of like, you know, associated in a, in a way. So you're not working on your own. So maybe slash lay outside the topic, you know, incorporate, we're always talking about what life balance. We have yoga, we have lunch here. Once you become an entrepreneur and you used to be in this environment, how do you adjust yourself and how do you keep the balance? I think balance is another interesting question. I should, I think balance is a personal choice. Um, I think everybody has needs to get to know their own bodies better and you know, understand are you a morning person?

Speaker 1:          16:55          Are you a night person? Are you, what personality are you normal, regular, working hours person. Um, and what do you need in your life basically? Right? So when I left the corporate, um, what I've done and I could have wiped out my schedule, like nine to five or whatever and also Monday to Friday cause I had seven days in the week. And, um, and I'm not sure if you, you probably know like this, I'm sure what it was, but you know, like this, um, there's this story about this professor in a university and he comes up with like these two vases and like stones and sand and then he talks to the students about, I think it's about time management or something. And you put in like, you know, the stones and the days and then I'm sorry, the sand into the vase and then the stones and it doesn't fit basically, that have overflows.

Speaker 1:          17:38          And then he puts the stones first and then, um, the sand around it and then everything's fits perfectly. And I think that was the analogy around, you know, making sure you put the priority. Like, you know, like you will the priorities in check and you know, your ducks in a row. But I think that's what I've pretty much done with my schedule with my time. So I wiped everything out and I say, okay, I need to sleep like seven hours a day. So where do I plug that in? I actually tend to sleep between one and eight for example. And I work the best actually between 10 and one cause that's like my quiet time. Um, I proud of that in then. You know, friends, I see them for brunch or drinks or whatever, like to call my mom, you know, all of these things basically that.

Speaker 1:          18:23          Um, but somehow actually I read this, I had a really simple lives. I don't have that many stones to Putin, which as a result, the rest basically it was basic, you know, sand for me and my businesses stand basically. Right. It's kind of everything else that, that I create in my life. And, um, and that's my definition of work life balance, because if there's anything in a stolen coming right, I mean I would visit to make, to make that stone sort of work somehow and just remove the sound a little bit. Right. Um, yeah. So that's good. Oh yeah. I'll ask one more question and I'll open up to the floor. The Googlers are really good with questions. Just be prepared. Um, so what advice would you give to funders out there? It doesn't matter, male or female. What do you do say to, I would actually say like, the advice that you find in this book is applicable to everybody, right?

Speaker 1:          19:17          I mean it just comes from a female perspective because that person happens to be a woman. Um, but, uh, I think my general advice is to do it, to explore whether entrepreneurship is for you. Um, there's literally nothing to lose. I mean, if you think, I mean, maybe it was a bit of money, fine. I mean, you can, you know, dawn another company and or money again, right? Um, but you know, like the time is not lost because you learn so much and it's so different actually to how corporate life works. And you also get to know yourself actually a lot better. So I think entrepreneurship, you know, is a really good way to get, you know, like too for personal development. And, um, and you know, some people succeed, great, some people don't, but then they realize actually, you know, I don't have to build a business.

Speaker 1:          20:07          I'm actually much more happier. Cause sometimes you don't know what you have until you actually get rid of it and like loser basically. Right. And some people actually I know are very happy but in a job and still do, you know what they did on the side as a hobby basically. But then at least, you know, you feel a lot more comfortable and at ease that, you know, this is how I want to design my life now. Right. I mean it's not a constant, um, state I would say. Yeah, exactly. Oh yeah. Great. So now over up to the floor, if you have questions, just raise your hand and I'll give you a microphone. So we'll start from there. Tell me about the process of writing the book, uh,

Speaker 2:          20:48          in terms of selecting the, the, the, the founder's Eh, how you pitch it, how you convinced them to separate a time to write these really intimate later. You gave them a deadline. Did you have to do much chasing? Tell us a bit.

Speaker 1:          21:01          Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So it took me about nine months from having the idea to actually holding the book in my and my hands. So it's, it's self published through Amazon. Everybody can self publish a book. Um, and uh, so took me in total nine month and, um, I started with the women that I know, the new, uh, that I have invited to speak at my events. And I think the criteria was that they had to be, you know, um, they must have achieved something interesting, basically insignificant. So I had like, they had to be in business for at least three years and a ideally, you know, there's many like employees or race that much funding or have generated this much revenue. So all of the 66, altogether, they've generated $1 billion in revenue. Right. And some, obviously more than others, but you know, and uh, yeah.

Speaker 1:          21:50          So I leverage my own personal network. Then I have, um, ask them basically to kind of refer me to other women because, you know, it's, uh, you know, it's a small group of four or five pills or then people tend to know other people. Um, I have also, um, reached out through, you know, the Google network, like the accelerator networks, a startup weekend. So I volunteer for something or we can organize or weekends and so we can, as around the globe and that I utilized after I have pretty much gotten like, you know, 20 people like in around London and the u s which I provide the first people you get because it's kind of like, you know, the, the density is there, but I really wanted to have a global perspective. Do you have people from, you know, New Zealand, China, you know, and um, Columbia and Mexico and, and, and things.

Speaker 1:          22:40          So for that I had to use sort of like top to other networks and started working with amazing. That works. So, um, you know, everybody's like so helpful and you know, helping you to connect. And, uh, also my business school friends because they are everywhere in the world now. So from near Dubai to Indonesia to like everyone's a bit like a high, you know, and um, and so that's how I have reached out. I think the, I also tried linkedin and just like Linkedin, like connections and messages that was like the least effective, but I called a couple third that, um, yeah. And how we'll approach them was actually I, so I actually wrote a letter myself as a example. Right. And I gave them quiet, um, specific. So the f um, I suppose directions, right? So it started with DFMO founder cause that's the title of the book and everything.

Speaker 1:          23:29          Start with the female founder. It has to be between 500 and a thousand, not, sorry, 800 and 1,500 words. So it also communicates, it's not too long. Yeah. You're not asking him to write like a book, but just a letter. And, um, and, and basically just think about, you know, if you were to sit down and write a letter, what would you advise to your younger self or, you know, your best friend who was starting a business and, and, and, or the future generation of female founders. Right. And I think that idea has resonated a lot with the people that contributed, that everybody was just so happy to do it. And they were like, oh my God, I always wanted to do that. It's like, good that you're giving me the chance, you know? And, and I got actually a lot of gratitude from people because people were like, actually, you know, thank you for helping me to find my voice and my story and to tell my story because I've never done that before because I was never asked because that comes with it over Israel problem because they were never ask.

Speaker 1:          24:29          Right. Um, so yeah. So I think somehow, I think the idea just resonates it. Um, pretty much everybody had a positive response. Um, probably hotter people. I've contacted well conduct around like 150 people. Um, so it's lovely. I would love to contribute, but I'm so super busy that I just don't have time. But you know, let me know when it's out. And, um, I would love to support and spreading the word or something. Um, yeah. Cool. So just go, do they also post it to you like writing and stamp? No, no, no. Oh yeah. So Google box guys. Yeah. So, um, yeah, no, it's to be honest, like the, the actual, my work was really just project management cause he was just, you know, you quit your hit list, you contact them, you see what they say, right. Does everything in excel or Google sheets. And then literally I would just ask people to send me a Google doc. Right. And then we would, I would edit it in the Google doc with them and every letter before we had like, you know, between three to five, sort of like rounds of, of um, feedback and then, um, and that's it. Right. Just sign off. That's the text. You copy it further and that's not good.

Speaker 3:          25:41          Thanks. Thanks for sharing your story. Um, so you mentioned that, uh, the letters are from sort of a global base. Yes. So you, you spoke to people and had contributions from all over the world. Um, what proportion of the letters were from sort of the US versus Europe versus Asia in general? And did you notice any trends, like themes of different types of challenges that people faced in North America versus what perhaps they faced here or, or in Apac? Okay,

Speaker 1:          26:09          so I think around, I forgot the numbers, to be honest. Uh, around 2020 people are actually from the UK. Another like 15 or so are from the u s so like, probably half of the book is kind of UK, u s. Um, and then the rest is kind of like across the globe. Right. And at some one I would just literally keen on having somebody in Africa, for example. Um, and yeah, and I think in terms of the advice that the people, I mean, I also had like entrepreneurs [inaudible] stuff in Sierra Leone, but we're actually Americans, for example. Right. So it's a bit, you know, um, but I think in terms of advice, I think it really depends more on the type of business and the industry that they were in. Then the actual country. I do see business, you know, in the, in the agents that have like sphere, there is more cultural expectations, um, around, uh, around topic of entrepreneurship because it's not something that women do to be honest.

Speaker 1:          27:09          Um, and uh, and then in, in terms, and it's funny cause I think the, the girl from Latin America within lady actually, she's a scientist, she's like heavy, heavy like science stuff. Um, she kind of was, um, was interesting because she's like, she doing as like super serious thing. And then like her letter was kind of like really bubbly, like, you know, so that's what I felt that you and the way that she was writing, that's the other Latin American sort of flavor came out in a little bit. Um, but that's just kind of like, you know, for, from an editing perspective, um, from a content perspective, I would say I was surprised to see that probably only like five to maximum 10% of what people talk about is actually gender. Genderized is actually sort of about like, oh, as a female founder, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah.

Speaker 1:          27:58          Like most of the things are really just super, you know, applicable across everything. So I think, and I found that quite interesting because, you know, I didn't give them a bit, a more specific brief and then I shared with you just now and people were not, you know, um, oh my God, I'm a female founder, I'm so discriminated and you know, the word is so horrible, you know, I mean, you obviously have that, but in the grand scheme of things, I think probably also people just don't want to share that back to the future generation. Right. I think, you know, we, we, we want to be more positive, um, about, about entrepreneurship. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          28:35          As you, as you've mentioned that we as as women, we don't have as many role models in terms of CEOs. Uh, there are female out there. I was just wondering if there were any common topics in the book and the letters, um, about women feeling a bit like the imposter syndrome and Google sometimes they talk about, oh my, I'm not sure if I should be here if I deserve to be here. So I'm just wondering with women being CEOs if there they talked about anything about, I cannot believe I'm a CEO

Speaker 1:          29:02          or things like that they did. There they do. And I think, um, what did come out, I think what makes a difference at women wrote those letters is a little bit of that, but a lot of about, um, taking care of yourself kind of thing and being true to yourself and not, you know, trying to do something just because the rest of the world wants you to, to do it right. So for example, I'm in a typical startup acceleration phase. As you know, you, you, you know, you start a startup, you get like, see, like, you know, you go through an accelerator, you get your seed funding, you get your series a and B in another and so forth, right? And, um, and it requires a certain of business to do that and actually sort of perform against all of these metrics, but it might not be the best business and it might not be the best miss this for you as well.

Speaker 1:          29:50          Right? So people pivot, right? And then sometime it's kind of like, you know, am I doing the wrong thing of having graduated from a Texas accelerator for example, and now pivoting into an agency for example, right? That might be super profitable because we were really good at what we're doing, but isn't the high growth tech business that people thought that we were doing in the beginning. Right. And I think letting go and, and, and sort of like, you know, sort of that type of attachment. Um, you can, uh, like read a little bit through, through the book and, and also then, you know, attached to like, it's, it's, you know, it's very stressful obviously, um, to just be okay with yourself to say, okay, you know, I am in that game or I am in a different game and I'm totally fine with being in a different game.

Speaker 1:          30:37          Right. And, and to the south, the imposter syndrome thing. Um, so that's actually in the first letter written by a lady called Alex. Uh, Alex on a deep latch from hospital commentary exited hustle couple of years ago and now she's building her second startup hub bill path. And um, she has like, one of her tips for that is when you sort of have a important meeting, important presentation, you go to the bathroom, you look into the mirror and you say, I am the shit to yourself, right? And then you go back up and then it's all good. So things like that, you know.

Speaker 1:          31:16          Cool. So what is the next step for you from there? So you know what the book was literally something, I mean, I didn't have any motives behind the book to be honest. Right? I mean, I published it because I've, I felt the content was needed and then I was engaging with the community at the time. So for me, I'm obviously super happy to promote the book all the time because I think it's, it's valuable content, um, to share. But, um, you know, I'm not Simon Sinek basically. Right? There was like, no, like gigantic other thing that is kind of like coming behind the book is literally just kind of like, you know, for the universe really. And, uh, so my business is around building this infrastructure for female founders. Right. And the book is obviously one element is one product that you can, that you can get.

Speaker 1:          31:59          And, and the other product that, the, the thing that I want to scale is, um, you know, this online to offline sort of infrastructure that includes the online community where you can make connections and, um, you know, share knowledge and experiences. Plus then sort of seeing everybody in real life in those coworking spaces that I'm creating. Right. So, so that's kind of like, you know, sort of the, the business that I'm looking to build and a, at the moment we have the first one in all street. Um, and we're looking to kind of, you know, then grow that and open more spaces. And in west London, um, I'm actually thinking about Bali because why not? Who doesn't want to work in Bali and other locations. Yeah. We're going to do one more question and then, yeah. Cool.

Speaker 4:          32:55          Hi Lou. Thank you for joining. This is truly amazing. It's something that I would dream to publish, but I'm glad you beat me to it. The question I have for you is for there anyone or any founders that you reached out to where you thought, you know, they might never respond and when they did you were kind of nervous or like, oh my God, they actually responded

Speaker 1:          33:16          like a Sheryl Sandberg or, yeah, it doesn't matter. I try to [inaudible] stole sandbar but didn't go far enough I suppose. Um, I think, I don't know, it's a difficult question to answer because

Speaker 5:          33:33          yeah,

Speaker 1:          33:33          I though positive, honestly thing that every woman who has achieved something almost has a moral obligation to do that. So therefore, you know, I think that when people responded positively, I was like, yes, you got it. Awesome. Let's do this. Right. Like I wasn't me, like, hold on, call. She accepted it. This is so amazing. You know, it's, I, it's fine. You know, I mean it's, it's, um, I think, um, yeah, because I know in that way, I mean I felt a bit and title, does that make sense? And the, in a non sort of like, oh no, I think just got to do this kind of thing. But I actually genuinely think that that, you know, successful people have a moral obligation to, to share their knowledge with, with the future generation. So I was generally happy that they got it and they didn't know they were supporting me on, on that journey.

Speaker 1:          34:25          And, um, and I think, um, I was also kind of, I think what I was surprised about is actually the, the, the surrounding support, right. So one thing I forgot to mention is actually I also had a nomination process to find interesting, um, women and a lot of people actually use that actually because sometimes you don't know the woman yourself, but you know, their previous pa or the marketing manager or you know, is now like a female founder herself. And then she knows me. So she would sort of like, you know, suggest her previous boss and, and, and, and, and stuff like that. So that I actually felt, um, it was really nice, but that got me, was like, oh, sweet, exciting. I didn't know you were doing, you know, so, so, yeah. Cool. Great. So thank you Lou leaf of sharing the experience and the book and thank you everyone for coming and all the good question. I hope you guys enjoy the book. Feel free to maybe ask a Luli afterwards for a few questions. Sign the book if you won. So, yeah, see you guys next time.

Speaker 4:          35:23          Thanks.
