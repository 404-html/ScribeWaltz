Speaker 1:          00:08          Thank you everyone for this special edition of talks at Google as a fireside chat with Mr Nadine, who, uh, Mr Nadine Loseanne is one of Asia's leading social impact entrepreneurs, tech investors and financial inclusion pioneers. He is the founder of telling all microfinance bank, formerly the meal microfinance recognized by the World Bank as one of the largest and most socially impactful bags. And, uh, the field globally, uh, easy besa offering from the bank past revolutionized Pakistan's mobile financial services industry. His latest Venture Planet End Group is Pakistan, is foremost technology growth capital and incubator platform, uh, focusing on financial inclusion and facilitation of entrepreneurship in Pakistan through technology. And he has added 24 companies, uh, do his portfolio across ecommerce, financial technology, educational technology, mobile television, retail and renewable energy. Let's welcome our speak speaker. Uh, you had, uh, you had an unusual, the beginning, uh, often spending nearly 30 years in banking. You came back to Pakistan, just start a new venture at the age of 49. Um, what was easy and what was hard to start something new at that age. And how did you decide to start a microfinance back back in Boston after having lived in different countries?

Speaker 2:          01:51          So I spent about 27 years, but Citi group in about eight different countries. And my last assignment was actually out of the Bible that was disposable for Iraq during the sovereign debt restructuring. So of that 27 years, I'd spent half my time in investment, consumer banking and half my diamond disc management. I was 49 years old and I'd figured out that pretty seven years, I'd only spent five years in Pakistan launching the consumer banking Pakistan. Otherwise I'd been outside Pakistan and I felt it was time for me to go back and do something in Pakistan. Pakistan had been kind to me. I got where I had because of my, you know, education in Pakistan and subsequently in the u s but I want this tag of saying that I've done enough of city, you know, I had become relatively senior in Citi bank making decent money, but I wanted to go back and create something in Pakistan, which would be, I hoped I would be able to change an industry.

Speaker 2:          02:50          It was very ambitious for a person who had only worked five years in Pakistan and had actually never done microfinance before. And reason I wanted to do microfinance were two fold. One was simply capital. If I want to do own a bank in Pakistan, a commercial bank capital requirement, it was $100 million and a microfinance capital requirement was 10 million donors. As you can see, that decision was an easy decision to get into as far as capital department. It was a good son, but this huge financial exclusion in Pakistan of our country right now have 200 million people. Less than 6.7 million people have access to formal credit. So my view was that if we could create a microfinance bank, which could actually structural as this process, do, you know, create a bag, which was done by professionals as opposed to necessarily. But it's not that the other institution I'd run by professional, but people who had cabinet, Margaret Experience, people who are consumer experience, people who are global experience.

Speaker 2:          03:48          You would have to learn microfinance because all my knowledge of microfinance was a book written by Doctor Eunice. So I hadn't done microfinance before, so that was a challenge. But I taught it we will be able to create a world class institution using the 27 years of knowledge I had at city and the capital had buildup at city, you know, two options. And was it the funny part is that when I exited Citibank, Citibank stark was $35 you know, it came down to close to $2 afterwards. So there wasn't, you know, my bar, it was, you know, uh, luck. But right now I was reading the Citi Bank stock is cynical of stock is back to 2009 years. It was at night. It was a big decision in the sense that I'd spent 27 years working for one company, getting a salary in a very comfortable environment.

Speaker 2:          04:38          You know, when you're getting a check every month, you're getting a nice bonus. Every year you get transported to a new country and the company takes care of you. It's a nice life and it's not boring because you're moving from country to country. So the new market, so you're always getting, you know, a different experience. When I was growing up, you know, like most Pakistani's at that stage, my ambition was to become a head of a multinational in Pakistan because you know, it's a great job. You get a lot of perks, make 1 million bucks and I'd be done. You know, that was my initial ambition. Uh, you know, I'd be happy camp. I never had that stage taught at work for myself or create a company for myself because that whole mindset that I was to go find a multinational, do work for, you know, and get promoted and become a country head or maybe a regional head.

Speaker 2:          05:28          So the first transition was that I would be creating my own company and my family comes from a middle class in Pakistan. My father used to be in the Pakistan Navy and then garden and the automotive industry. My mother was a high school principal. There was no examples of any entrepreneurship in my family. So I was the first person to actually move from a salary job into, you know, an entrepreneurship kind of thing. So that was the first decision moving away, the safety net of a nice tax free job in Dubai, coming back to Pakistan and you know, putting my own capital at risk. So out of the 10 million, you know, I put in $6 million IFC, we know $1 million, and they would do local investors that put in 3 million to get to the 10 million. The second thing was I had never worked in Pakistan beyond five years.

Speaker 2:          06:20          And actually I was a Pakistani, used to go back every year to Pakistan working in Pakistan, you know, especially in the microfinance environment would be very different. So that was another challenge, uh, that, uh, you know, I knew I would experience, but I'm impulsive kind of person. So once the bug bit me that I was going to walk back, I actually didn't even paid for my bonus that dia incidentally would've been half a million bucks because we had just finished the sovereign debt, destruction of Pakistan and the city bag and made close to $120 million on that deal. It was a massive deed. Uh, so I was country had Iraq, but I, I couldn't wait so I just given my resignation. So going to go back to Pakistan and you know, my boss said, you know, you're going to be going on for abiding by, it was four months away. I didn't know. I can't wait. I've got to go back. And I just went back and started talking about bank.

Speaker 1:          07:09          Well my current to prices tend to estimate the demand side. Interest rates are typically higher for microloans and recent randomized controlled trials show that direct cash transfers that is cash without any strings attached, has more impact on poverty and livelihoods. So how does tend in all bag, uh, ensure that micro loans side impactful in upward mobility and breaking out of the poverty cycle for the communities.

Speaker 2:          07:35          I thought this is, we want to be easy interview. So there are two schools of thought and both come up with scientific evidence. One says in the controlled group environment, when you do microfinance lending, it would a period of time we actually show improvement. And there's not an equal group of people who actually demonstrate that. No, you cannot isolate that improvement. Whether it's uh, you know, floor that had been converted from you know, mud to wood or a bathroom within put in or kids are going to school or there's less people getting sick because of the incremental income that you have is not necessarily due to the intervention of the microfinance bank, but they could be other sources of income coming in and you put, because money's fungible, you can't necessarily isolate the impact. Microfinance lending is ag. So both exist and you know, both I've done by very prominent people who've done ab testing and demonstrated that deer right in my 11 years, my sense was that I met enough customers that we changed the lives that we know then dimension we had done had made them actually better off than they were before.

Speaker 2:          08:47          The big risk in microfinance is that over in depthness you get a customer, do we actually take more money than he or she can rebate and that's when the default, otherwise it typically the rates of default and microfinance, if you got the right underwriting, I typically in the 1% the big challenge in microfinance is not that your customer is going to default because they don't have, they haven't given you collateral. It's your business model. How do you take care of the long tail customer? Your Business Model takes into account that you're going to sell as opposed to a bag of tea bags, one sachet at the time. So you have to build a business model that incorporates it just selling one sachet at a time. And unless you can do that, and that's why large commercial banks are not successful in microfinance because their business model is very different as you know, mandarin million dollars or $10 million or $200,000 of loan at a time.

Speaker 2:          09:41          But microfinance is one loan acquired at a time for an average of maybe $350 or $300 where the customer has no finances, no, you know, credit report of any kind. And you're actually estimating the ability to repay the debt service by human intervention. And that's the reason the typically microfinance rates a high, it's not because microfinance banks make a lot of money. So if you look at globally, what kind of, you know, money microfinance banks make or microfinance institutions make, it's not a very high number. You will send them, you'll find a microphone has magnetic bank making $100 million of $50 million income. It's rare, I would say, you know, a good current, you know, but 10 banks globally would do that. The reason the rates are highest is the cost of customer acquisition and the cost of underwriting. So if you look at an industry that's it, industry is 30% and you said, well, you know, you're going to be poor guy and you're learning at 30% and that's not fair.

Speaker 2:          10:46          I mean, you're gouging. The customer is already very poor. So what service are you providing? You've just maximizing your own returns. But if you break and peel that onion of 30%, you find out that out of that 30%, typically 15% is customer administration. Why? Because there's no, I mean, very few microfinance banks use scorecards for the Bowman. So everything is human intervention. Tommy Bank at 2000 people by the time I was exiting because you need to go and see the customer, you need to figure it out at the able to repay your debt or not. So you have to go a couple of times to figure out what their repayment ability is. Because typically in developing country that that level corruption is high because these people are not used to getting anything done without paying money. So if they need a passport, they need, uh, you know, uh, a CAC card, which is, you know, like identity because they're always being some kind of money to touching between.

Speaker 2:          11:43          So typically the imagery immediately offering money to your relationship manager and that's something you, you know, you want to avoid because you want to have a culture where money's being taken. So you have a separate person. We ain't gonna benefit ration process when they go and recheck that the customer's estimation of what you're estimating the EPM and is correct. When you have to talk to the neighbor to see if this person living in is, you know, how has been a long time or what type of, then you go to his place of work and talk to his neighbor again. So it's a very laborious people intensive process. It commercial banks, customer administration is typically around 2% 3% it microfinance banks is 15% then you have pasta funds that typically commercial banks have low cost to fire because they have checking accounts or they have savings accounts.

Speaker 2:          12:29          Typically microfinance banks don't have checking card. They can tell me the bank had one, uh, but most magnifier and banks and dependent on going to the interbank market to raise money because the customer's view is if I have to borrow money, I borrowed from microfinance bag, but if I have to deposit money, I'll go to a commercial bank because your money's safe. So if I'm to, that's the kind of fat, if you're willing to lend to me, you can't be all that you know, uh, you know, strong and by your capital. Adequacy is concerned. So it takes time for microfinance banks to, you use the cost of funds to typically you borrowing 300 basis points over the money market rate. So let's save the money market brain Pakistan was 6% typical. My girlfriend has borrowed, we'll borrow it, nine to 10% so 15% plus 10% like 25% let's say the Ford is 1% so you're 26% if your margin of one or 2% at 28 so the rates are high, but that's the decent rates.

Speaker 2:          13:24          If microfinance bag start embracing technology, you can bring the administration countdown. If every time you'd approving secondary using score cards or artificial intelligence to create algorithms, we can forecast, you know what your default rate is going to be. You can bring some of the administration cost dunk. If you create, you know, checking account or mobile account program, you can bring your cost of funding down. So my timing, my ambition was to bring art. [inaudible] was 28% trimming it down to 15% and credit card rates in Pakistan at 30 32% so, you know, hopefully the new management is looking towards that. But that's the reason, you know, microfinance is rates range from 30% to 40% but they don't make that much money. It's because of the way this whole business model is.

Speaker 1:          14:15          So tell it all that has created and instituted a successful mobile payment system called easy besser and many have tried to introduce mobile money in Asia, but they've been right through successes. How did go about creating a new infrastructure and network to enable the mobile money? What are the challenges you faced and how did you overcome that?

Speaker 2:          14:38          So, so the biggest challenge in creating a mobile distribution network is behavior change or you got to realize that the poor are willing to pay for services. They don't want charity. And their view of value for money is much, much more acute than yours and mine. So, you know, we spent some extra money, but they have a finite budget and they have to work within that and they're willing to pay for value. If you create value, they now we're never going to be pay for one, but this is a behavior change requirement. So when we looked at Pakistan, you know, and, and we said, listen, this financial exclusion that we have is not limited to credit. It's also limited to savings. Since 1947 or Pakistan was created, it's could be 70 years. You know, this month the entire commercial banking industry's only open close to 32 million bank accounts.

Speaker 2:          15:30          And if I take unique bank account, you're probably talking about 15 million and the savings to GDP ration Pakistan is under 6% so we said there ought to be a solution for savings as well and savings can generation get generated when you start payments. So how do we create a payment culture, parks, a cash society, and there's about three point 3 trillion repeats of money floating in the system because everybody plays catch in a country of 200 million people. Unfortunately registered taxpayers are about 1.2 million. The bulk of the taxes are collected or indirect places. So you know, people don't have bank accounts, they want to keep money but they use money all the time. Cash and cash is expensive. Uh, you know a, there I depreciate in terms, you know its physical form you need to carry, it can get stolen. So if you can do digital payments many ways you're better off.

Speaker 2:          16:22          So we said, okay, we want to get into the brightness banking business. And again, the idea of easy Pesa didn't just come to me and I went to Kenya to look at m Pesa. I went to Philippines, need to look at g cash and I looked at various applications and said and obviously telling, nor was a partner at that time. So they had some insights as well. And we said the easiest way to get people to start using Brandis banking is payment of utility bills. Now you guys talk typically pay through your phone maybe, but in Pakistan every month, other than the telco payments, 30 million utility bills are created core power, gas, water, and people typically go to a bank getting online in a, during banking hours, give up the work time to make that payment. And bags hate these people because they can just the lobby.

Speaker 2:          17:15          So can again imagine they're not bank customer that is coming to page to dibels and the standing and the teller. Why the bank customers on the side. So the main mega as difficult as possible for these guys to play. Uh, but that was the only venue and we said, okay, if we can create a mechanism where we just start accepting utility bills and make it easier compared to what they're doing right now. When you started behavior change, 12,700 banks in Pakistan, 9,080 ms where people never use ADM for repayment bills or do you can 95% of you was just for cash withdrawals. Does the typical, you know, psyche, you can even make a interbank payment through ATM when people don't, they just use it for cash withdrawn. That's likely go globally. So we said Pakistan has now let's say 90 million unique sims. You know, people would fall under 120 million, same cards outstanding and 99% of those are prepared.

Speaker 2:          18:18          So it's not like postpaid account. So here the most people actually buy scratch cards or do a top up very frequently, you know, in the month whenever they run out of same balance. In order to accommodate that, the telcos had to set up a vast Asian network where people could go and buy Sim cards. It's like India, like Bangladesh and most developing countries. So the Telcos had set up agent network multiple of what the bank branch network was. So the Vision Board, if you can create the change that 80 network into providing basic banking service, like opening an account, closing an account, making utility bill, making a transfer, then you would actually create an alternative network, which would be far more convenient for the target market we were looking at, because this network is in the neighborhood, it's open seven days a week is open probably 14 hours a day.

Speaker 2:          19:11          The one that doesn't go to play golf, you know, so it's something that's service oriented because these agents are selling a whole bunch of other stuff other than just a time. So we basically started onboarding telco agents for accepting utility bill payments. Now that was the behavior change. When these customers go to a bank, they see a bank brand disease, you know the board of the bank and they're comfortable that my payment when I make it, it's going to go through the drilling company and my power won't be cut off. So we're telling them, hey guys would you know, go to the small shop the moment Bob Store in your neighborhood and pay your utility bill and you're going to be okay. And the guy says, hell no. You know, if I can make this payment and this guy shanks on tomorrow and my power gets cut off, who am I?

Speaker 2:          19:58          Where's my dress? Who do I go to? So we tried to overcome that by issuing a receipt by telling our bank. So we said, listen, General Bank, simply bank regulated entity. If you power get cut off, you can take the bank part of the central bank, the central bank will make you whole. And the second policy we had what? Because the average payment was very small and the aboriginal average payment for the common man was under 2000 rupees. So our policy was never dispute. Just make that payment. So the power that never gets cut off, even if you think the customer in the wrong, just make that payment, get that confidence level up. So there's behavioral change takes place. Two people start paying the utility bills at the local mom and pop store as opposed to a bank. And that was, you know, the change we want to do it.

Speaker 2:          20:48          And a lot of campaigns, we tried to literally beg brand ambassadors standing at this moment pop stores. So you know, Trinity Bill, it's interesting is here's the receipt and you know, I want policy was no dispute, just pay. And you know, the time I left, uh, Tommy Bank was doing 10% of the 30 million bill pays three myths, 3 million base would be bills were being paid through us. And that customer, Sally's for confidence of actually new going to a woman pop store and bring a banking transaction started. So that was the initial step. The second step we said, you know, it was an annual, you when you, if you're a startup, you make great plans and many go to the ground. You sometimes find out that those plans are, you know, are in the base of a basket because you call it drunk, but you have to figure out a way to pivot.

Speaker 2:          21:39          So we thought our biggest product was going to be international remittance. Pakistan gets $17 billion a year from workers in the Middle East, in the UK and in the u s and we said, you know, bank branches, 12,700 closed on a Sunday, half day on Saturday, close long period on Friday for prayers. We would be able to use our agents across Pakistan, 60,000 agents and be able to do this payment out. And then therefore the large payment provider that flood to come to us because we would have said great distribution. Well the only thing we miscalculated was the average limiters size is $40,000. Sorry, 40,000 rupees. And the small agent doesn't have liquidity to pay out five of these moments in a day. And all you need is if you, if a Pakistan is go to ATM is not working it's yard, no problem. But if you go to withdraw cash from a brother's Magni agent and there's no cash, they said, oh, this guy's a fraud.

Speaker 2:          22:38          And the toll conference level, you've built up changes. So our international image, this product failed. But in the whole learning process, we are necessarily that there's a huge component of domestic limiters, $15 billion that paid domestically in Pakistan and has gone through. The way the money's transferred is through some nickel hawala Hornby, which is informal payments through you know, money agents or to the post office or you know, people were into your home down and you just give them the guys too. They give it to, you know, your family back home. And we said let's try domestic limiters and domestic limiters with a phenomenal success. And as I said, in our regional plan, there was no domestic limiters as a product. But that's when we, you start pivoting to when you were original plan fails week and that's what actually achieved the biggest behavior change and the industry we created that instead of going to informal channels, you would go to an easy pesa agent and say, I want to transfer money.

Speaker 2:          23:36          And he will say, who do you want to transfer to? And in Pakistan there's a universal identifier called a computerized national identity card. So it's a 16 digit number. Everybody has, you know, you just got can't live without anyone. We didn't do anything, so I would promise jobs transferring money to you. I would show them my CAC card. I would give them yours, NFC card number. If you're in a cell phone, I'll give you a cell phone number. I'd give my cell phone number and then the agent would hand over his feature phone. Because remember you're working on SMS at that time, smart phones hadn't come in and he would ask you to put in a pin number six digit. Now incidentally, in 90% of the spinning numbers were one, two, three, four, five, six but ideally, how we all came back and within three minutes that money was available at 60,000 agents and the beneficiary would go to the agent and say, I have the money come.

Speaker 2:          24:29          And he would say, okay, show me your CIC. And they will physical should have crs and say, okay. They would give him the phone and say, put in your pin. But obviously if one two three four five six for bill and the money would be drawn to, it was a huge change from wedding, from the post office or informal services and it was phenomenally successful. So we got to the second stage, you know, of what was getting people not get to a comfort level after utility bills, just start making domestic remittances. Uh, the problem was that we went to the agent, the agent said, I'm not going to do this. You know, I make a hundred percent margin on the things I sell. This thing takes time. You want me to add, you know, at least 40 characters. But Damn, I'm done with the trust zone.

Speaker 2:          25:15          We're going to add the CDIC number from myself since I see number for you. Just extend, there's 32 digits. I'm going to add a 16 digit pin, 38 digits. It's gonna take time. So they extracted the pound of flesh. Then for every dollar we made, they took 70 cents. That's the price we paid for getting the agent that worked to absorb or accept that as banging with miss 30 cents. We're left with the split between the Telcor Tylenol and Tommy Bank. So we had to then look at doing huge volumes to be able to make money. But the agents were very happy because initially they were reluctant but then the style signing up. But, but the end state was mobile wallet because we are still learning to Bradley's bagging because we've got physical interaction. You have to go to an agent. It's like when I talked to him, you know I see an ad in the paper which says Xyz Bank has opened a digital branch.

Speaker 2:          26:07          You can walk into the branch and there's no human intervention. And I said to myself, why in the hell would I want to get in my car who travel for five minute miles and then go to the branch and say, wow, digital branch, you know, this is the smart phone is my digital branch. I should be able to transact everything. Boys sitting in my bed bed watching season three of game of Thrones. And you know, the latest episode and do my transactions. So you know, it's just mind boggling for me in or this digital brand content, no human in dementia. Maybe it's you know, busy street next to your office. But why would I even want to walk any way to do my transactions? So our next dog, it was creating mobile wallets that if we could create mobile wallets instead of just physical activity and if the customer was able to populate the mobile wallet, then you know, person to person transactions, utility bill payments, person to business transactions, gtpb government, the person projections would take place.

Speaker 2:          27:05          And the three point 3 trillion repeats floating in the system. We start coming into the magnet system and we would have a secondary revenue stream, but we would have some float on these mobile wallets. Was it the transaction fee? So initially we had a hurdle or how to open these bank accounts because the central bank required a physical face to face to open a bank account for Kyc and anti money laundering. Barbara says that to know your customer, you've got to see them. Now that's a difficult call. That means I either the customer would have to go to my branch and my brand and my network of agents would not be able to open or they would have to take a photograph of the customer photograph of the CIC with men, the deck, the feature phone wouldn't work because of pixel quality was too poor and the agent would have to have a smartphone and who would fund that smartphone?

Speaker 2:          27:57          So our advantage of having a large network Carney got me know, uh, under leveraged as a consequence of this requirement. But at zero, sometimes things happen in the industry, which don't happen because of view, but you get to benefit from. So the Ministry of Interior decided that every person with a cell phone had to be biometrically verified because there were a lot of activities taking place. Sometime kidnapping, some time, terrorist activity from cell force, they could learn defy. So if I give myself my identity card at the time, I'm making a transaction to us, you know, uh, Bradley's bagging the agent that brings bang agent would take my Sinesi card and have five Muslims issue, which I didn't know about it. So the Pakistan Telecom Authority first came up with a way that if you put in your senior as the card number, you find out how many scenes have been issued in your names.

Speaker 2:          28:52          And I didn't mind at 15 sims and I knew that only three of those were mine and the rest. But you know, people using my energy for creating a Sim card, you know, account, uh, were Delco. They were paying them on time, but above my same, and if tomorrow something happened, you know, the agencies or I would be responsible. So first, you know, this whole tage took place of political Simms went away, but they still said is not working. So they said every sim has to be biometrically verified too. So if you hold the phone, you would have to go into an agent and be biomedically verified, which would be verified by the national entity. Based we have, which is called Nada. And then your son would become active. And if you wanted a same immediately you couldn't get one. You'd have to get biometric, you'd have to do the official address and it'll be delivered to your home.

Speaker 2:          29:45          That took away like 35 million seems from the telephone market in me, you know, the period of time in the Sim to place. But then we had a very strong case and we went to the central bank and said, Hey, this sim is biometrically verified by the central database. Why am I required to see a customer? Let's create bank accounts in line with transactions and know your customer risk. So let's say we have some nick on 11 zero account. This level zero gown says you can do 50,000 rupees. Every thousand rupees is $50 of transactions in a month. That's good for 90% of Pakistanis. Given the per capita income we have send me back the loudest and the industry to do a remote account opening. So all you ever do is to send an SMS to four of the banks, which are connected with telcos. And you can open a wealth account.

Speaker 2:          30:37          The store, the first thing that came about was the one minute account, which actually doesn't exist in many countries, including here. You have to physically go into a bank to open an account. In Pakistan, you can open a level zero count remotely under one minute. So this hurdle of opening a mobile account went away with dispute regulation. And right now there are 27 million mobile accounts in Pakistan over a three period as opposed to the 2030 2 million bank accounts. There's 1947 so branchless banking or technology can actually make huge impact, you know, when used properly and it can change behavior of people. So obviously nothing is easy. So we have 27 million, 23 million mobile accounts. But the next question you would ask me is, that's great. How many are active? Because opening an account is easy because I ran a sales campaign where the agent gets paid for every mobile account and he has, you know, his grandmother and his dog opening an account, you know, just because he wants to get to that target will be going to pay him to opening a mobile account.

Speaker 2:          31:42          But less than 25% are active and active is generally defined as one transaction in 30 days. That's the GSM made, you know, definition of a mobile account being active. So we have yet to create the ecosystem to have the customer can leave money in their mobile account so that this becomes a source of revenue for the brothers bagging players. Because until you get to a stage where I can, so I was giving a mangrove getting great tangent. I was giving a speech about, you know, what I call digital Pakistan and I said three things need to happen and if we do that, you know, will get exponential growth. The source was the one minute account and that's actually taken place. The second was the six orange purchase. I should be able to buy six oranges with digital cash as opposed to cash. So if I'm in going to inbox then you have a lot of hawkers you know, people with just small is if I'm being a one done a butch, is it a paying him cash?

Speaker 2:          32:42          I should be able to pay with digital cash and that acceptance, a dig and players that you know that merchant acquisition as in taking places the end and when it does Sunday you'd see a very high level of activity in mobile account. And the third thing was the five click onboarding that you know, if you're sitting in a religion you wanted to become an ecommerce margin, should be able to do in five clicks, be able to set up the photograph of the product, set up your payment mechanism, set up your logistic mechanism and the fifth grade you should become a motion. Obviously that needs three g and four g coverage, which is happening in Pakistan. So those things, when you have those kinds of things happening, suddenly you see digital transactions taking place. So that was the challenge. And I think we are halfway there.

Speaker 2:          33:25          So we've got the mobile accounts open. Now we have to make them active startup investor. What is your view on the current technology and entrepreneurial scene in Pakistan? So Pakistan, remember the country of 200 million people, you know, that's a lot of European companies combine and you won't get to 200 million people. But a lot of, you know, the Lens you see Pakistan from here is, you know, there's blood in the street, there's bomb blast, there's, you know, or the prime minister they remove for corruption. So negative news galleries easily. And I've been trying, I've been here what two days and I'd met was turning 12 people already loaded them vcs just talking about what's happening in Pakistan because there's a counter narrative towards run by CNN and Fox, you know, a lot of positive things happening. So what's happened in last six, seven years in Pakistan is an emerging middle class, for example, that 30 million people in the emerging middle cloud with purchasing power because the inflation rate has been around for four and a half percent salaries.

Speaker 2:          34:29          And growth will company growth rate has been around eight to 10% so people has been plummeting getting incremental income and now you have 30 million people in one country which have purchasing power. Right now there are 45 million smartphones in Pakistan, which is expected to go up to 80 million by 2020 so remember the smartphone is, you know, calling in, you guys know this better than me. Calling is just the 1% of a feature of the smartphone is the biggest thing I mentioned. I see this happen in our lifetime and it's going to revolutionize many things. If you have a smartphone I can do, he helps with you. I can do education with you, I can do he and genuine with you. I can do if an financial services within a doc Watson of these initiatives where you basically the world changes when you have a smartphone by 2020 Pakistan is going to get 90% GSMs coverage, three g and four g all over Pakistan, just Sunday ruler.

Speaker 2:          35:25          Pakistan gets collected with urban Pakistan and with purchasing power increasing, you've got a whole bunch of people who can now be no box both ways they can buy things with the previous didn't have access to or I have access to them. I can run remote education program, I can do, he held consultations at clinics which are better. Doctor is President Karachi, but I'm in a remote distant part of Pakistan and I can do diagnostics and then I can use the payments to pay the fee immediately happening. And again use my iPharmacy who sent the medicines out to those people. So Pakistan, I'm getting connected and this is what I'm dong the vcs over here, that he has a country which is staffed for seed capital that two PE firms and three vcs in Pakistan and the largest angel investor in Pakistan, which is, and I'm far from a high net worth as far as Pakistan is, which family is a concern?

Speaker 2:          36:19          We just sitting on half a billion of cash liquidity, half a billion dollars. Okay. And if I'm the largest investor is a travesty because these guys, you know, can invest a lot more. But I viewed this major opportunity because I think Pakistan is grossly undervalued with all these things I'm talking about. This big consumer vive is going to take place and the valuation that will appear time go up, the vcs and bugs outside Pakistan are going to recognize Pakistan is a country where they ought to come and invest once they get over the Pakistan risk hurdle. Okay. And then, you know what valuations we have now, we're going to exponentially increase and people who invest now are going to be able to write that benefit, detecting the initial risk and people will get rewarded for being in Pakistan at the right time.

Speaker 3:          37:08          Steve Question, a question is that whether the regulatory environment in Pakistan poses a huge challenge to, to the startups and what can, what is changing and uh, what can the startups do to not fall into the dye?

Speaker 2:          37:25          So, you know, there's good news and bad news. The good news. For example, if people are starting and microfinance institution, Pakistan's regulatory environment is recognized by the economic intermittent unit as number three in the world. So that's very sorted out. But if you're not in a microfinance world, then it's a challenge because the laws are geared for the old economy is they're not geared for the new economy. So by like if you look at neighboring India, they have started India where they've taken five or six different things and said we've got to change these laws. If you're going to make an entrepreneurial culture happen in India, Pakistan, recognize this, those things. For example, if I want to register my company, I ought to be able to do it online and pain this, then they should be a separate window. So that window exists, but it's not very effective.

Speaker 2:          38:17          Right now. If I'm investing, I should be able to do a down round with Pakistan. Lord doesn't currently allowed. I should be able to give employee options that Pakistan Lord doesn't curl be recognizes. So we've identified all the issues working with the security, the Gates Exchange Commission, working with the tax regime. Now to provide shelter for both invested in investees because you don't want to have a lot of, you know, off that fed and you want to make that invested. Actually, you know, some prediction for that money that gets written off initially. So we are getting there in our day yet. Uh, but it's recognized by the government. Now that Pakistan has a largest youth cohort in the world, 75% of people that are under 35 50% of people are under 25 as these young people graduate, there's no way our current economy can absorb them to regular employment.

Speaker 2:          39:09          So they hire has to be entrepreneurship in order to make that entrepreneurship is, it can be a dividend or it can be a bomb because if you don't have employment for the youth coming out, then they'll get into what I call reverse ATM. So when he's at a traffic light, as they can have your phone, can I be a wallet? Can I have anything else that would be full? There'll be withdrawing from you. None voluntarily. Okay. Because you've got to give them employment. It has to be means for them to sustain themselves. So that's why the diamond in the private sector. And that's why I have so much passion for depression because I think that's the future because Pakistan is such a young population and I've worked with young people and they have far more brilliant ideas I can even think of and the need if you know, environment where people can believe in them, mentor them, help them grow and provide capital.

Speaker 2:          39:56          But I'm just one person. So maybe we need to have a whole slew of people and support system from the government that makes this a much, much bigger player on a grander scale. And we're getting there, but we're not there yet. So a followup question on that note, uh, how, what role are detective incubators playing? And uh, if you can name a few which are playing actoral in, so that 34 incubators, accelerators and Pakistan and I would say probably three years ago they were five. So there's a mushrooming and understanding that incubators and accelerators can play a role. Uh, there's plan x, you know, plan nine Nestio my incubate or Dell XC. You know, universities have incubators as well, but the view, right, the good news and bad news. Again, the good news is that you know, entrepreneurs who want to go into an accelerator incubator program now are able to get mentorships.

Speaker 2:          40:55          They will, I will to get coworking space. The bad news is there's only one accelerator that actually pays you, you know our values you and gives you money and once you graduate they're not enough. Seed funds are, you know, available over there. Vcs that when you're graduating and your initial capital is burned up to give you money. So the risk we run sometimes is that you're going to have default rates far higher than the natural 95% default grid because there's not enough capital once you graduate. And that's one of the things that I've spending at least a bulk of my time on, is getting people. So the seed and vcs at this or when people graduate have a great idea, they don't die because of lack of capital. They are to die because it's an idea that can be scaled, not because they didn't know capital and great ideas. Just, you know, finish it off for maybe one last question. Mesmerized. There you go.

Speaker 4:          42:02          How long do you think it would take for beavers to change as far as like actually using digital while I didn't do digital John's actions, uh, orange, uh, thing that you were talking about.

Speaker 2:          42:13          What are the constraints of the six audit? If you know the banking business, then there's something called merchant acquiring that if you use your credit card or a debit card at a merchant is the point of sale machine pos machine where he was just stripes your card and you know, the payment gets made. It takes money from your credit card and you know, visit to the supplier. So the constraint Pakistan was the deck costumers that Boston machine costs about, you know, that's it. $30 $35. And if I want to go to a real small shop, here's the hook. When tree is not equal to the $30 risk I'm taking. If I were to build 100,000 margins, I need $30 million of capital to put a hundred thousand machines in please. But technology is a way of changing things and now you have QR codes. So look you are report now at the merchant can be put in, we are post machine is no longer required and if the customer has a smart phone, you just to text, you know, puts a skew or a board and a payment can be made.

Speaker 2:          43:15          But the challenge is still remaining is that why would typically the bid that the bank makes money is that there's something going to much in Discount Rate Mdr. So if you started up a merger, the merger is going to be you one and a half percent, 1% depending on where you are in the word as fees for the facilitation that you're doing for increasing the sales. Because other than cash it wasn't going to come in and use a credit card or a debit card. But I'm mom and pop store to the Hawker. Not going to give you 1% he says the Dag, you very much. I liked Gash first. He would ask me not to take guys they didn't want to charge me, you know, for not the gas doesn't work for me. So this business model needs to be worked out that if you create these margin that you make money from float as opposed to transaction fee and the Pakistani markers not there yet. So while you are a board has been established and people like experimenting like Fingernail, you know, but you are bored or HBL or to the master God, there's real inflection point is come and they figured out the business model.

Speaker 2:          44:20          But I think we had Martin probably a year to 18 months away before that gets correct. I'm going to dig a shortage is about, so let's see. Great. All right. So, uh, we have

Speaker 3:          44:32          one final question and maybe a minute and a half for that pretty broad one. What can companies like Google and other bay area companies do, um, in the, uh, in your opinion, in the, uh, emerging markets?

Speaker 2:          44:46          I think, you know, one of the things, you know, we would, a large players can do, where do you honestly, broad response to believe in Pakistan, believe in the talent that exist and use some of the, you know, CSR and non CSR money in supporting that and some of that you already mean done. Tall Dell Xc my accelerator as a specialty for, we know, data cloud funding from Google for startups, but they're got to a lot more of that, take some investment dollars, put it in the infrastructure in Pakistan because this is, like I said, you know, a touring a million people country with a large youth cohort, which will become Google customers for life, you know, uh, so there's lots of one investment that needs to take place. Then a lot more understanding the precision of what the local dynamics are, not just for Google, but for other people in the bay area who want to access the, you know, country of 200 million people.

Speaker 5:          45:41          [inaudible].
