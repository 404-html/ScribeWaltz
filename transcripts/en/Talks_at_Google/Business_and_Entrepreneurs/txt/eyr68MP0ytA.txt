Speaker 1:          00:00:11       Welcome. Thank you for coming. Um, I guess we can take a seat or something like that. We can also stand up. I don't really have a preference. I'm welcome here today. You're a Texan and see if I'm allowed to call you that. Eh, I mean I've been in talks with you for a little while. I am super, super excited about you coming today and talking to us and telling us about what you do. Um, but before we begin, since I've been at Google for a very long time, but I also know people that are working the Mba, MBA embassies and in diplomacy and adds a lot of a different approach to things. Can you please just tell me about your first meeting with Google in this capacity as an ambassador?

Speaker 2:          00:00:53       Yeah, no. Well first of all, thanks for, for hosting me today and thanks also for listening again. Um, yeah, I'm, I'm a career diplomat. So you know, normally this is the kind of gear that the, that you wear and we're here because of the UN General Assembly. So a suits and actually ties. This is sort of part of the uniform today. But, uh, when I arrived in Silicon Valley a 12 months ago, I had one of the first meetings we had was actually in mountain view with, with the Google headquarters. And, uh, it was a clash of two different cultures and to some extent the class of civilizations because, uh, together with my tech bitsy, we went there and more or less dressed like this and our counterpart came out and flip flops and a shorter shorts and a, and I think in the old Metallica tee shirt. And we actually have a fantastic picture where we standing next to each other. And for me, this was sort of the wake up call that we actually need a dialogue but two different worlds. And the after that we also went out to buy a lot of the gene, some of those white sneaker. So now the uniform is different and we are also in that area a little bit different than what diplomats and I'll be like, yeah, I did hear about you saying that you'd made really poor financial decisions. I have too many suits. Spacing. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:59       So, uh, you're the world's first, uh, Eh tech ambassador appointed by a country. Um, can you explain to the audience a little bit more about what a tech ambassador does and the whole idea behind it?

Speaker 2:          00:02:16       Yeah, sure. Well, if we, if we go back to or euro, so on perhaps one and a half years ago, um, there was a in innovation processes inside the Danish government and inside the foreign ministry where we looked a little bit on trends and how to bring basically the foreign ministry. And so the 21st century and a and some very talented younger colleagues came up with a number of different ideas and one of them was so point, I'll take ambassador. Um, and, and the reason for this are two trends. If we look at it, one, one being the, we think technology and probably I don't have to convince anybody in this room or anybody watching him, that technology is going to be one of the main drivers for global development. And it's going to have a lot of positive effects, but it might also have a couple challenges along the way.

Speaker 2:          00:03:01       In other words, uh, technology will be defining the winners and losers of tomorrow, but it will also define some of the foreign policy or international relations of this world. Uh, also balance of power where I think things like machine learning, artificial intelligence, perhaps even iot is going to be as important as a conventional weapons or, or even nuclear weapons. So, so the mindset of looking at technology from a foreign policy point of view, uh, goes to the core of this initiative. And the other trend or the other main reason why we did this was of course, um, and this one I know I don't have to convince anybody about, uh, sitting here today, is that some of the big technology companies now, at least in the u s are becoming very, very big, very influential, not least with the platforms that you guys said, development and build an utilize.

Speaker 2:          00:03:49       But we also see in increasingly that, that companies are perhaps using that platform power also to begin influencing policies and, and the, the direction of this world. So we basically are, the Danish come visit is decided that instead of just watching the future past by outside the windows, we wanted to actually begin treating the industry and technology and digitalization as a foreign policy priority. And by creating this a first ever et seq representation and begin dealing with these issues to see, to influence the direction despite being a very small country. And, and what if like with a company like Google have to gain by engaging immediate with the tech ambassador? I think you have a few more users than the size of the Danish population. Um, but, but, but I think, I think the basic idea behind this is actually that we, we can't do it alone.

Speaker 2:          00:04:46       I think government is always trailing behind our new technologies. We don't necessarily get it right on regulations, on legislation. Our policies are being challenged because of the fast pace of these new technologies. And whether you call it the digital age or the fourth industrial revolution doesn't really matter because I think the gap is widening on, on our ability as governments, always international organizations to actually sort of cope with the, with the future. Um, but I don't think that companies are able to do it alone either. And of course we might discuss a couple of, of examples over the last couple of months or the last year or so. But I think the point here is that we need each other and we need to work closer together than we have perhaps in the past. And we need to find a, you know, joint solutions on some of the big issues, both global issues but also national issues. So this is basically a very big, warm, fuzzy huck on the Danish government to the tech industry, but also a sort of subtle way of saying we need to come closer together and we need to define together, uh, solutions to some of the big issues that we are faced with. Also on a global level. And then as we talked about, you know, that's, there's one part where you're always saying, oh, governments are trailing behind and digitalization for governments and all that,

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       but tech companies as well needs to also be really add a level of how governments are thinking about protecting their inhabitants and own protective, but also offering them opportunities and that they can get get caught behind. And this like global tech revolution that we'll see. Let's just call it the fourth industrial revolution. I think that's a nice term for it because there's so many things that are happening out there. Um, just to dial it back a little bit because we start out, we always talk about it like it's Denmark and full disclosure, I am from Denmark. I've been living here for eight years, but I still have a very big stake in thinking how interesting this is. You know, so maybe you could explain to the world why Denmark, such a small little country on the northern tip of Europe with the population size of Colorado for Americans. You know, why is it Denmark of all countries that start, that becomes the first to a point, a tech ambassador and gives them the mandate you to go out there and try and engage with us.

Speaker 2:          00:06:59       What do think are the three reasons why we came up with this? I mean, first of all, we have some extremely talented younger colleagues who, who saw this and who came up with the idea and who were able to convince the senior management back home that we needed to go in this direction. Um, the, the other reason is, uh, is of course that um, we have a little bit of street cred on digitalization because we are very digital country. We are, uh, where they look at a UN, uh, assessments or European Union assessments. We normally come out at the top of the, of these assessments in terms of public digitalization. You probably know that 90%, uh, of, uh, of all communications between the government and citizens in Denmark are today electronic. I think that's a, an all time world record, which means that you move, my grandmother needs a new driver's license.

Speaker 2:          00:07:46       She has to log onto a computer and go online to actually get that. Um, so we have, we have a tradition for being quite digital and, and also using this as an actual thing. Um, if you look at something which, which every single day in the has, that's a civil registry system, something called the CPR system is basically, um, a number of a personal identification number that is given to you within minutes after your birth and it follows you throughout your life. And that contains a lot of the data that the other countries are today discussing. Whether you need a sort of a, a whole of government approach or universal, uh, identification system where you can store medical records or educational records and so on and so forth. And that's an integral part of, of the Danish society. And I think it's also one of the reasons why we have a high degree of trust in, in public government.

Speaker 2:          00:08:39       And that's perhaps actually one of the differences between, uh, between Denmark and the US. We tend to trust the government quite a lot. Uh, I think at least in the part of the world or part of the US where I'm living in, in silicon valley, the, there seems to be a little larger trust in, in the private sector and in, but, but the way we use the trust in government is that we have the system, uh, it hasn't been breached or hacked, um, yet and hopefully it will never do that. But it actually offers a lot of opportunities for using the states at which is a available. So I think those two, three things are one of the reasons why we came up with the idea. But the last one being that we have always been a small country in Oakland country, very dependent on others also because of our size. So looking into how we prepare ourselves for the future. What will it mean for our labor market? What will it mean for, for global affairs? How can we continue to take a, a responsible approach to helping other parts of the world that are perhaps doing less well than we are cells. That's the last, the reason why I think we, we, we took this initiative

Speaker 1:          00:09:43       and then that vein and our history of using big data as a way of the population and trusting the governments with our data. And you know, we, it is quite wild. So thinking about that, the government XSL access to all your health information and all your income and tax information on all these things. And do you feel that that's a, a driving force that the, the, the government, the, the population of 10 Max has all right, we trust the government to forge these relationships with tech companies. And this is why it's not the u s a China, France that's gone out and done this initiative.

Speaker 2:          00:10:25       By the way, we, we might come back to that. Other countries are looking at what we're doing with quite a lot of interest. And I think a lot of other countries are considering whether to a point tick ambassadors, whether it'll be in silicon valley or in Beijing or in one Joe or somewhere else. I think that's not the important bit. But the fact that other concerts that are getting inspiration for what we're doing and acknowledging that we need to treat technology and teach it so platforms in a more systematic way is positive. So some extent it's part of my KPI that we deliver other countries also because it's super lonely to sit out in Palo Alto all by yourself. I really missed the National Day receptions, which is such an important part of diplomacy these days. I don't actually put that nobody is watching. Right. So it can be completed.

Speaker 2:          00:11:06       They will eventually. Yeah, I'm a blog but, but, but, but, but I think, I think the trust thing is important but, but I also be very honest sitting here in front of, of, of techies who understand this much better than I do. You know, we have a high degree of, of confidence, uh, between the citizens of Denmark and the public sector. When you look at the, at sort of perception data on globalization or where the world is heading, the Danes, I'm generally also quite optimistic. They look at the future in a, in a positive light, even despite of global affairs and issues that you might point to a currently. But I think it's also fair to say it doesn't take too much or too many. Facebook came [inaudible] a case cases to perhaps tilt that confidence. Um, and we spoke a little bit about the civil registry system before. Um, and of course one of the reasons people trust us is because it hasn't been preached, it hasn't been hacked, eh, but one could imagine of course, that the public trust in the systems and uh, could go sour if we see more of these big scandals. So that's another reason why we need a conversation with technology companies. And that's one of the reasons why we have a lot of focus right now on data ethics, on also on cyber security issues. So we make sure we protect these systems against the mullein excess basically.

Speaker 1:          00:12:23       And I would also say as a comment, you know, working at Google and I've been here for these last nine almost 10 years, it's what's happened over the last year, you know, has sort of for the first time, from a personal perspective, I work on these platforms is, is that we are all of a sudden on the wrong side of the trust conversation. Right. That's kind of new for us. You know, it's always the government's, that's that the, that, the public's mistrusts it's usually the, the, the tech companies have been good beacons and stewards of all this data and all these things, which we still are, but it's just the, the fact is that many of the things that we offer and have has far reaching implications that we might not have been able to, um, to predict. But I can say that the discourse internally in the company is very much what you were saying that like we need to make sure that we get around as good to hear.

Speaker 1:          00:13:12       Yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess that's also why you're here today. You know, it's not a, Oh, take the promise here. We're just going to shut the door. It is a thing that's on everybody's mind. And we can also see that a lot of audience here is, that's a good point, right? Uh, but let's, um, I started out saying, you know, ask questions cause technology can really cover everything. It's, there's not a lot of things that's not influenced by technology. Your water's Datadriven, you know, it's everything that is put into it. That's tech driven water, whatever. But I would say that, um, a fair question could be what have been at the core of your work the last 12 months that you've been a tech ambassador? Yeah. Well

Speaker 2:          00:13:59       one of the differences between the job I have now and some of the jobs I've been doing previously is I get one question all the time. You know, what on earth are you doing and what are the success criteria for actually doing that? And I can tell you nobody who came directly from Jakarta in Indonesia, nobody ever asked me the question, what do you actually do? And what's the added value of, of having an embassy in Indonesia? We're having an invest in Indonesia. I get that question question the all the time and my answer is not very sexy, but, uh, I'll give it to you unless what we are trying to do is basically elevate our dialogue with the tech industry where the companies but also with other countries and international organizations. I mean, it's not a coincidence we're meeting today, uh, during the, the UN General Assembly week because technology and digitalization is going to be an important topic you're on development on, on the future of a, of multilateral systems.

Speaker 2:          00:14:49       Um, but the core of what we are trying to do and what my team is trying to do is to offer to dangerous authorities a formulas platform for having a dialogue with companies like Google or some of the others [inaudible] eh, on a wide range of topics. And what does that mean? It means that we're doing exactly the same as a, as other embassies all over the world. Not only dangerous emphasis, but you know, US embassies or a Belgian embassies and that is representing his authorities on whatever topic might be relevant. So, in other words, one day it might be coming to to mountain view and say we'd like a conversation about data privacy. Uh, the next day it might be a question of digital taxation because that's a topic that is very much on the agenda in Europe these days. A third day it might be, you know, how could, how could we get access or convince Google to do investments in data centers in, in Denmark.

Speaker 2:          00:15:40       And the third day it might be on some difficult questions on how do we avoid platforms being misused for, for radicalization, extremism or terrorism. So that wide range of topics is there. It goes to the core. What we're trying to to do, I think it's important to say that this is, this is not a pessimistic tick agenda. Um, and I'm not saying this to be friendly to techies in this room, uh, but this is really about the use using and reaping all the opportunities that technology brings about. And when we fundamentally think that technology will do good for this world, but we also have a realistic view on it where we think we have to work together with Google, with others to make sure that we mitigate those areas where they're the real dangers and we'll difficulties, for example, on creating sort of global inequality or a digital poor part of this world, which I personally think is going to be one of the major challenges.

Speaker 2:          00:16:29       Getting the remaining three and a half billion people online so they can also reap the benefits of these issues. But at the core of what we're trying to do is really this government to industry conversation. And in that sense, what I do is very old school. In fact, I would argue that it's sort of bringing in diplomacy back to its roots. A diplomacy has always been about putting people into hotspots where changes were under way. In the old days it was typically into a wall prone areas or where conflict existed. Today, it's about putting a diplomat's into, into the heart of Silicon Valley so that we can have conversations with you guys on how we fix the world or we make sure that we don't undermine some of the key values and institutions that we've been working on for very long time.

Speaker 1:          00:17:12       Yeah. And I think it was a small, easy issues and small, easy as yours. But like we got to also have to got with fact that there's something called legislation that you guys represent. You know, and we must looking at legislation, which is a tool you guys have is a tool that the governments have view the US. Everybody has, you know, you can say legislation and technology's definitely does not always move at the same speed. Uh, and obviously we can talk about Gdpr as an example. Many people in here has been involved with that. And, uh, it's, it's, it's, well, it's, it's, it, it has been in the works for several years. When we look at how long it takes from the disease, an example to actually be put into practice, you know, we, we can also see that in California. They can push the consumer privacy act through and I guess two months that was real fast that they do these things. That's a part of it that's very, very interesting to how legislation and the political agendas and all that. It's not always fine tune to come with our emergency entirely and they will look at what is coming up with blockchain and AI. You know, when we look at decision making and governance, um, what do you feel that we, you and I and everybody else I can do to close the gap between technology and regulation and we can start saying what can governments do? Well,

Speaker 2:          00:18:39       a couple of different angles on the questions of course, the million dollar question, how do we fix these issues? Well, I think from a, from a government point of view, we have to recognize that we are going to be challenged over the next couple of years or the next decade because of the piece of new technologies. Uh, you mentioned blockchain. I think Iot is another good example. And of course machine learning and artificial intelligence is probably going to transcend everything we do. I mean, no sector will be left untouched. No industry will be left on touch and therefore no government will be left untouched. Um, I think from the industry side, um, and, and I don't want to be sort of a too rough on big tick, but what I would say is that I think we have a shared responsibility here. Um, one of the things that I continue to argue quite a lot is that we might not see eye to eye between Europe and the u s and some of these issues.

Speaker 2:          00:19:29       There has been a bit of tech ash in Europe and I think on the US side there has been perhaps some, uh, some concerns about the direction that Europe is taking GDPR being one of them. I think antitrust legislation, uh, is another one, but it doesn't change the fact that we have to stick together because we're still products of the same values that we paid a very high price to, to get to. Um, at the conclusion of that is that we have to work also to find the right way forward. And, and just to take one example, if you allow me, restaurants, digital taxation, I know it's a tricky issue. It's a tricky issue in Europe. And I know it's a tricky issue also with, with headquarters or taking the industries. But if you look at Europe, technology companies pay around half of what traditional companies are paying in Texas.

Speaker 2:          00:20:13       And you could say, well, that's a smarter way of operating. But for the most European countries, this is an existential issue because this is what basically undermines our ability to pay for education or healthcare basically to uphold the welfare state. Um, there are a couple of proposals from the European Commission, um, currently being discussed. Um, I don't think they're particularly popular in, in mountain view, but you can correct me if I'm wrong on that one, but it doesn't really change what I think is the way forward. And that is that we have to work together on finding solutions also, for example, in digital cessation. So what I mean by that, I think we need to answer sort of into a contract where we come to the industry also looking for advice, looking for some suggestions on what is the right way forward, not to stifle innovation to make sure that we have a protech pro platform environment in Europe.

Speaker 2:          00:21:04       But we also expect from the, from the tech industry and from the senior management teams that they help us to find the right way forward. It's not good enough to say we don't like the European Commission's proposal. And when you then ask the question, so what should we do instead in with the answers? Well, let's not offer us to, uh, to define. I think it is. And I think that's, that's where we are today at a crossroad where we have to expect from, from the senior management of the tech industry that they help us define the right way forward. Whether it is on digital taxation or whether it's on regulation or whether it's on legislation because of the absence of that is not going to help the industry and it's certainly not going to, to help the governments or, or in our case Europe either. So. So that's the way forward, uh, in, in my view. And that's what we're trying to do with this initiative by the way.

Speaker 1:          00:21:49       No, I, I see it and I've could at some point say there's, the communication is pretty much like one way as you're saying, like we do get engaged and say we don't like that, but maybe we could build a feedback loop in that sense. But yeah, that takes time. And that's why you're the first tech ambassador. She start getting these feeds going. You know, it's, it's a legislation again, right? That's the tool that sets in one way. And maybe there's a gap in legislation in Europe that needs to be fixed and agreed upon by member states and the European Union.

Speaker 2:          00:22:18       Can I just add one thing? Restaurants. I mean I think, um, I I don't think are revealing any state secrets by saying that of course Europe is not always a United on how we deal with technology and digitalization, how we deal with a big technology companies. There are different views among the 28, uh, or you 27 soon. Um, but, but what we often, and I think that goes a little bit back to one of your first questions. What's the, what's the value proposition that we bring also to a company like a Google? Well that is to have a dialogue also the issues we might not see eye to eye on. It's also an opportunity to begin discussing, you know, how to, how do we create the regulation or tomorrow so it doesn't undermine the commercial activities of the taking the, which is perfectly fine for us.

Speaker 2:          00:23:04       We don't have any problems with monopolies. We don't have any problems with, with companies growing and making money. As long as that is not misused, that dominant position is not being misused. So I think, you know, companies like a Google or Facebook or Alibaba and others, they will find no better friends than a, than Denmark in the sense that we've always been light on regulation, but we always been right on regulators. We have to make sure that we go in where it matters also to protect our institutions and democracy and human rights or the big stuff, which, which is, uh, important and which we fought quite a long time for over several centuries. We have to make sure we don't undermine those institutions. And having that discussion and bringing the two parties together, I think is going to be essential in the next decade.

Speaker 1:          00:23:47       And I think from a personal perspective and all that, and I think it's been for many that it is actually a point where we should get to, you know, it's technology moves at such an increasingly fast paced, even if you are in it, you're not necessarily always able to predict the influences it has all around. And this is the, the exponential change, right? It is faster and faster and faster than Moore's law and all these things and the human brain thinks linearly. And so there's organizations you don't necessarily get into that, but we'll try and get ahead of that. And it would be the, the aspiration and that sense and why you are here. But, um, let's try and, um, look a little bit of a wider perspective because your mandate is actually global, right? Like we've been talking about the u s the European Union and all these like complicated dense matters that are there. But let's talk a little bit about like, we have some exciting opportunities is out in the tech diplomacy. So, uh, your team is Kinda like you, you work from mountain where you work from Silicon Valley. Sorry about that. But you know, we also have a part of your team is situated in Copenhagen and in Beijing. Yeah. For you, what does it actually mean to be an ambassador to a global industry?

Speaker 2:          00:25:00       No, it's not just, it means having meetings at horrible times. So almost everyday because finding a common time to, to have the whole team present, there's basically impossible because of the time differences. Um, this, this is also a foreign policy experiment. I think it's important to mention that we haven't done it before. We don't think anybody else has done it before, but we think it's the right way to look at diplomas in the 21st century. That it's not only about having a one embassy to one country, but it's in fact looking at, at a, at an industry or a sector in a, in a holistic way. Um, again, I represent the foreign ministry. So it goes without saying that we are focusing on the global aspects of, of new technology. Um, so, so I think if you look at the u s or the America is, if you look at Europe and if look at Asia, uh, changes on the way, um, it goes without saying that there is a shift or a change also in balance of power.

Speaker 2:          00:25:53       Uh, I think when you look into the crystal ball, it's evident that, you know, in Europe received, we'll move east, I guess where we're sitting. It could also move a west. But, but the point being that, um, you know, China and other Asian countries, Eh, look as though they're going to be using technology as a, as a game changer also for their position on the global scene. It's interesting, you've look at investments in artificial intelligence. The last year, venture capital investments, I think a 30% or so went to the u s uh, 48% went to, to China and the rest went to the rest of the world. Which by the way includes two European Union. I think it doesn't require too much creativity to see that that's perhaps the contours of the new global order and a and that we might see technology being a, being a, you know, a driver for significant change.

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       I in the global scene, I think what we're struggling in Europe is of course to have, you know, a better focus on innovation. We need to also build some of the Unicorns that the US and China and the Asia is extremely good at doing. Um, and I think that requires us to take a look on, on regulations, on legislation, but it also requires us to take a look on mindsets and perhaps a little bit on access to capital for some of these big companies. Um, I think Europe has a role to play. I know we're sitting in New York, but, but, but I think Europe could play a role in the sense of help define the boundaries for newer technology. I know that Gdpr, the data protection regulation is not necessarily popular everywhere. It's not popular everywhere in Europe, either with small and medium size enterprises.

Speaker 2:          00:27:28       But it's a first attempt to try and define the boundaries and to make it crystal clear that data is something which is also personal, something that you can own yourself and that you have the right to be forgotten, uh, further down the road. Is it perfect? Perhaps not, but it's an attempt to try and set some boundaries for new technologies between sort of the wild west of silicon valley where everything goes and where it's all about building and creating, uh, but also the the wild east where you see the, the utilization of new technologies happening in perhaps not an unregulated space but certainly a speech which is very different than what we see in Europe by now. So, so again, from from our point of view, from a foreign ministry point of view, this is is also about looking at where the world is going to be not only in five years but also in 15 years or 25 years because that matters even though you are a very small country at the top of your, no.

Speaker 2:          00:28:18       Yeah. Now you're talking about, I guess looking at when we talk about the China and all that, you're looking into like the private sphere, what sort of invasion we can find there. But we are talking also a little bit about like influences, voiding policy and all that. Yeah. Which we were talking about before. What kind of like similarities or differences do you see between trying to do that in the u s and Europe and in Asia? Trying to get in there and see if you can influence that and the foreign policy side. Yeah, it goes without saying that we've been spending quite a lot of time with US technology companies to begin with. Um, also again for, for Trans Atlantic reasons, we think it's important to stay together and, and where we've been trying to do is, is to use, um, all diplomatic tools, which is going to have going into the headquarters to have conversations trying to convince in a gentle and nice way the headquarters to begin focusing more on some of these issues.

Speaker 2:          00:29:15       Also to take action in in particular areas where we might have issues or challenges. Uh, that has worked well with some companies, perhaps a little less well with, with other companies. Some of it is also because of curiosity. You know, what is this about? Is this sick Plumas initiative? Is this all about bringing the big stick of regulation and trying to, to, to do damage to the opportunities that the companies, well, it's not, and once we've had the opportunity to explain what we're trying to do, most companies have said, well, we actually see that this makes sense and we would like to work with you on, on this agenda, but we need more people around the table. We need more countries, we need all the international organizations around the table. Um, it, which is by the way, one of the reasons we're sitting in New York.

Speaker 2:          00:29:58       I can join the UN week, uh, you know, we welcome the UN secretary general's decision to set up a high level panel on teach Sukkot a corporation. So I think that's, and the European Union has done something similar, uh, under the, uh, the high representative Mogherini. So, so I think this is a trend. We are seeing more countries. We are seeing international organizations beginning to step up to the plate and focusing on, on digital, uh, issues and on technology proceed. So there are some differences. And of course there are differences. Also when you look towards her China, um, and some of the big companies, they have their, uh, my prime minister is going to meet Jack Ma later this week. So perhaps I can come back on Friday and give you feedback on how that discussion was compared to some of the other discuss with. That'd be great. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:30:45       Um, no, I actually had it's, it is, it is fascinating. And I'm, you, you're talking about the investments into Ai. That's the u s is making the China's making, which, you know, we move into a decision making faster decision making world, um, which is really, yeah, no, but I want, and this is my own like little thing. I always feel that, that's so interesting to look into for you in 10 years giving everything that we're doing with Ai. I never think that in 10 years. How do you think the Security Council will look like?

Speaker 2:          00:31:20       I think it'll look more or less as a dose today. Um, uh, it, it's, they don't think Google have a seat. Huh? We can do a sweep stake up, see where the, where it hits. Um, I think, I think it's important to say that although we are arguing for a closer public private partnership on some of the big issues, there are still a domain which should remain for fo, for estates and foundations states. And I think the UN will remain at the Security Council will remain if fora where states are discussing some of the big issues. However, I think what we will see is, is a, a small revolution where all these discussions will also take place in the margins of the UN Oh, in the margins of the European Union where we begin, uh, having, uh, you know, discussion groups or discussion for us, uh, to bring about the opportunity to sit together with the industry and actually talk about issues including foreign policy issues, including how do we make sure that you guys will also take responsibility for bringing the next 3 billion people online.

Speaker 2:          00:32:20       Uh, you will also take responsibility to make sure that we don't have, again, parts of this world that will, we'll fall behind because we shouldn't forget that this is not only about, you know, bringing health care or education to people that are less fortunate than others. This is also about making sure that the root causes of extremism or migration, that they will not be nurtured simply because of global inequality. So, so these are real issues. There might be commercial opportunities for a company like Google, but also from a, from a, from a government point of view, it is incredibly important that we work together to try and fix some of the, uh, um, some of the inequalities that might exist on a global level.

Speaker 1:          00:32:57       And then you answered one of my next question. I'm sorry about that. That's completed. That's where we should go. Right? We should, uh, we should, uh, meat instead of the problems. Probably not. You should be verbalizing them, but diverse, we're talking about like privacy and fake news and all that and, and where we are there and how we can work together. But I do feel that that's the future of collaboration and the UN and that if we can talk about like what the last 60 years to find the Security Council and the end of World War Two and where are we moving with the Cold War, whether that's relevant in the next 10 years perhaps. But then as we move beyond that, it is bigger challenges that we will need to partner ourselves. We cannot have the hammer of communism or the, the power of capitalism to solve some of those trains. Yeah. On my personal opinion. Anyways. Uh, I have two more questions left and then I think I'm going to start opening it up to the floor for questions. Um, and um, uh, I've been listening to your podcasts and we also met last year, uh, right when you became newly minted, Eh, and uh, you know, the one thing you did say was that after the first year, your success criteria would really be that you weren't the first and only tech ambassador. Hello. How's it going out there

Speaker 2:          00:34:18       relatively well, but not exactly as good as I hoped. And we are seeing a, you know, a lot of other countries coming up with, with similar appointments. I don't think anybody else had been given exactly the same title, but Eh, you know, I have a group of colleagues around the world that are dealing with some of the same topics. Some of them are called cyber ambassador, some of them are called ambassadors for digitalization or those are called ambassadors for entrepreneurship and startups. Um, but I think we will see a wave coming, uh, in, in not too distant future. And again, I think that would be absolutely fantastic on where she think that this is in the interest of everybody. Not only the government spent, in fact also the of the industry. Um, it would also enabled us to take collective meeting so you don't have to open the doors every time an individual take ambassador comes by, but that we can actually begin looking at how to cooperate together and perhaps I can deliver.

Speaker 2:          00:35:10       So those small t, so we're not ready with it yet. But one of the things that my team is working on is, is in fact to perhaps create sort of a coalition of a of like minded countries and, and a couple of companies where we actually create a forum where we can discuss the broad range of topics in relation to technology and where technology is heading. So perhaps we, when we went to have a conversation next year that will be established and we can talk a little bit about the vision and where we see that to hitting. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       I think that's about what I can say today. So stay tuned for more information on that, but it actually talks to the core what we're trying to achieve. But that's a Chromos initiative.

Speaker 1:          00:35:45       No, but that's actually true. You know, it's, it makes it bigger companies easier too because we are organizations, right? We have, we're at fault that everything that happens, it's very top down to try and say, hey, there's something really interesting we need to engage on here. Sometimes it's hard to get that bubbled up. So the bigger you have to be with the brand and umbrella organizations and we are engaging with that, you know, the UN even for us as can be hard to engage with or even state departments, which I've tried previously in my job. Yeah. We tip work very close to the Dana state of various things. So it's a, it's, it's, it, that would be a very good thing. Um, again, I, I need to refer it back to me listening to the podcast and all that. I, I, and it's, by the way, it's called tech promise.

Speaker 1:          00:36:33       You talk and it's an amazing podcast and you should realia Casper has some fantastic people. He interviews and they paid him to say that. Yeah, get a little bit, it's on podcast addict. You can easily find it on soundcloud and everything. No, it's, it's great. And on Itunes, right? Yes. Sorry. Yes. That's okay. It's an open plan. Diversify. So it's an open platform does, it's all good, but really a, if you are having any interest in, in this sort of thing, please get into that. Uh, and if anybody has any questions, please like get to the microphones. Um, but you know, you always finish with the question of these talks saying like, Hey, what question should I have asked you but I didn't? And what's the answer to that question?

Speaker 3:          00:37:19       Yeah. You know, it's, it's the poor man's response where you, you're know that you're not clever enough to come up with a good question. So it's a nice way to get people to, uh, to come up with a, with some interesting answers, I think. I think the question you restaurants and I sort of indicated a little bit of reply all it is, what can you do for us? What can Google do to, to support an initiative like that? Um, and I'm, and I think what is important is that we, we, we, uh, experience and we see also publicly a renewed societal responsibility from the second story. I'm not doing this all my Google here, but the industry per se, we need to see a societal responsibility, which is proportional to the kind of influence you guys have when you look at the platforms and all the new technologies that you're rolling out.

Speaker 3:          00:38:03       We haven't spoken too much about healthcare, but no, it's a massive investment all also for, for coming like, like Google. I think there was a commercial dimension to this and that is, I, I think we all are, is desperate to see a lot more responsibility, a lot more engagement, a also a lot more creativity in finding, you know, answers to some of these difficult questions. Um, so I think what you can do for us, which should serve cool own interest or the industry's own interest is actually to open the doors and begin becoming more comfortable with having discussions with governments. We're not out there to get you. In fact, we out there to work with you and a and help each other solve the, what I think are really timely. I'm incredibly important questions, not least in this day and time and age, we're talking about democracies. We're talking about human rights issues, about gender equality, what's all about the, you know, inequality at the global scale. These are not small issues. These are incredibly important issues regardless of whether you work for government on the dark side or whether you work for a, an upcoming year to your industry. A company like a Google

Speaker 1:          00:39:11       duly noted. Thank you very much to sign here. If you have somebody else do that. But no, I, I it's, it's a, it's, I think everybody is, is, it's always looking for making collaboration. Um, the like know Google has a mission, right? And that is making the world's information. Yeah. How has it helped me here? Free and universally accessible. Exactly. Right. Which really ties in I yes. You have a test when you're moving to Google it have to be able to answer this. Yeah. Yeah. That's amazing. Yeah. Now I'm getting a little flustered in that sense. Can't even recite the mission. But anyways, uh, let's start with the questions all the time we have and let's start with the right side and microphone. Hi, you could state your name and then, hi,

Speaker 4:          00:40:01       I'm Gabriela. I'm a designer here at Google. Thank you so much for talking to us today. Um, so my question is, I'm from Mexico, um, where the, where the idea of the government knowing everything about Usaa is bad, just you don't want that. So I'm curious, how did you achieve this like 90% of your interactions with citizens being digital. Is there a lot of infrastructure? Like do people have computers at home, do they all have in or did they have that kind of Internet literacy? And the second one is, did you have to persuade them at all or do they just trust you?

Speaker 5:          00:40:34       Yeah, a really good question. Um, and, and thanks for posting it. We, we're not letting me put it this way. You of course, like noticed that it's much easier to implement systems like that when you have a small homogenous country like Denmark where the distances are relatively small and where we already have a high degree of, of digitalization. But, but if I'm going to save a little bit black and white, one of the reasons I think we have such a high degree of penetration of digital solutions is in fact, because we didn't ask the population, this was something which was implemented gradually, initially primarily out of efficiency reasons. We wanted it to, you know, save resources, be more, get more bang for the buck in, in our communications and all service delivery to, to people and going pitch it. So it was certainly part of the, of that iteration.

Speaker 5:          00:41:25       I think that discussion has changed today where it's much more about quality, not so not only about the efficiency, but the honest answer is it was crafted, introduced. And the interesting thing was that the public sector took the lead this one time, just not something that came from the private sector. Um, you know, the public sites or took the lead. It was not incredibly popular, Nita and the private sector to begin with, but people got used to it. And today it's actually a competitive advantage because these companies are used to this. Uh, they've been doing it for, for forever. Um, but also the people are used to it. And actually one thing which might be shocking if you live in the u s is on average, it takes a day in 15 minutes to do the text report or the annual tax report, 15 minutes, because everything is provided. The digitally, you just go in and your chick, uh, you know, the numbers are they, do they look okay? Most people go to the end and see are we getting money back or do we need to pay some money? Eh, but that's some of the advantages and people enjoy that. Um, so, so I think the popularity is a, is certainly there. And so the second question was,

Speaker 4:          00:42:28       oh, did you have to, I guess you kind of already asked me, like, did you have to actually persuade them to get on board? But I think you said that you kind of implemented it gradually.

Speaker 5:          00:42:37       Yeah, we, we did. Um, but, but of course, as I said, what, what I think we had, we had to pay attention to was to make sure everybody was on board. So there is an analog way of, of replying to a, to government questions or to interact with the government because of course not everybody is online. And I think that's the important big that you have sort of a safety net around those that are not online. But the, the direction is, is crystal clear. We want to have everybody on board and I think with the, with the next generation coming on board, that will be even more natural than it than it is today. Um, but again, it is easier than a country like Denmark and they might be in a big country like Mexico.

Speaker 4:          00:43:16       Thank you so much. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:43:20       Hi. Thank You Excellency. My name is [inaudible] and welcome to Google. Um, I'm an Lsu. Uh, I'm also a fellow Dane and I'm going to preface my first question was saying I used to work at your organization. I have since switched your nice dress shoes with this very comfortable sneakers,

Speaker 5:          00:43:35       condolences about your experience before.

Speaker 6:          00:43:37       Oh, thank you. So my first question is on a foreign relations in general. So Google is pretty good at making decisions based on data and informing our product development. How do you see that informing foreign relations, for example, in your own organization? Are we sinking in more data to, to make informed decisions? And the second question is more on the monopolistic nature of a lot of these companies in the [inaudible] economy and regulation of the same. Um, so a lot of the innovation that Google is doing is often when we go into the marketplace and say, actually we can do better. So take for example, Google chrome. It might be several, uh, recently flat, but and, or Google fiber where Google decided to go out and challenge some of the comments of the market. Uh, how do you avoid regulating some of that innovation that also come from big companies? And when you do that, once you start to meddle in the market, how do you avoid that? For example saying, well, we're going to regulate maybe some of the American companies and European companies, but maybe, uh, the Alibabas and 10 cents of the world, we then go in and, and, and uh, get a bigger share of that market. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:44:34       So super good questions. Um, one, the first one, how do we use daytime informed policy? Well, I think we don't use it enough and part of my mandate together with my team is also too to help sort of change the mindset inside the, the government or inside the foreign ministry in a more digital direction. What does that mean in practice? It means, for example, that when we look at our development corporation with Africa, with Aisha, we, we also taking our a firm view on whether we're doing the right stuff. You know, is it, is it good to focus on, on a delivery of water in Tanzania and Kenya or should be in fact look at the infrastructure and building the right competencies for people so they can again reap the benefits of a, of the digital age. That's one area to look at it. The other, the other areas of course, to see whether we as a delivery mechanism can use data in a, in a better way inside the foreign ministry.

Speaker 3:          00:45:24       And, and last year we have, sorry, I have to to um, Nima a rival company, but as a u s rival company, we, we supported a collaboration between the Danish Refugee Council and IBM. And that partnership was about using data on migration flows. The, first of all, it's a better predict, you know, in Europe where people coming from, what are the reasons why people are migrating. But there's also too, to help deliver better humanitarian efforts. So in other words, people in your extremely difficult conditions in dire needs, how do we get the right kind of assistance to them so we don't send out the wrong stuff they do or don't need. And I think data is going to be creating a small revolution in how we deliver those kinds of services. So we get more bang for the buck. So efficiency again, but actually also make a bigger difference for, for the people on the receiving end.

Speaker 3:          00:46:13       So I think data will play an incredibly important role. But as with any other organization, it takes a little while to get the mindset going in that direction. But, but that's part of what we're trying to, to help with on the other, on the other issue, um, you know, I think your 0.2 to one thing which we're still struggling with in Europe and that is how do we support innovation? How do we make sure that we don't regulate, uh, technologies in a way that actually will, we'll be shooting ourselves in the foot in the long term. There is a lot of focus on antitrust and competition. Man, I'll be honest with you to share that. You know, when I, when I moved to, to the u s last year, um, and when I went to the headquarters in Silicon Valley, one of the first question was always, you're Danish?

Speaker 3:          00:46:58       I said, yeah, isn't the EEU Commissioner for competition? Isn't she dangerous as well? And said, yeah. And they said, you know, how, how does that work together? Because you just said this is a, a tech positive environment. Um, but I think permission and I told commissioner of SDR myself, so again, I can tell there's honesty. The interesting thing is just under 12 months we've been underground. Um, I think there has been a convergence of view across the Atlantic on some of these issues where there is a recognition that regulation is not only a bad thing as long as we do it in the right areas and then leave the other areas alone. Um, so I think if you look at commission investor, she, she's gone from suddenly being persona on Carta and certain parts of silicon valley or the bay area to become a little bit of a rockstar.

Speaker 3:          00:47:40       And you know, things are changing when the venture capitalists are saying, well, perhaps we need to take a look on recommendation and we need to invest more in companies that have a bigger social corporate responsibility, then things are changing. I think that's a positive thing. And I think that will actually also built, you know, a better companies and Mocha commercially sustainable companies. But, but I think the jury is still out on how we get it right in, in Europe. And we can't fix that as a small country. But I would argue not to be too focused on my own country that we punch above our weight on these issues simply because we have, you know, the, the degree of digitalization and we have, you know, a positive approach to technology. So we can hopefully also help make sure that you're a moose in the right direction on some visits, difficult questions. But again, we need the industry to help us to find what the right direction is. So that's why we are, we're inviting everybody to, for, uh, for longterm dance. Thank you. Um, and we have a question over here.

Speaker 7:          00:48:36       Sure. Appreciate it. Thank you for coming and speaking to us today. Um, as a veteran myself of a similar organization, I was a worked at the US government or us, um, you govern an it office while I was getting started up. Um, I have a great appreciation for the opportunity and the challenges you have in front of you. And you sort of answered this a little bit, but as you speak about the breadth of what you're doing in the per view of it, I'd imagine there are probably some legacy pieces of the Danish government that may not want you meddling in their business. And how have you been able to get the opportunity with them to create the influence you need to sort of enact these things back on home ground?

Speaker 5:          00:49:12       Yeah, that's evident be an insight. Has a question and you know how difficult it is to yeah. Bureaucracies to tumor when the right duration. Well, the interesting thing is, you know, I come from the foreign ministry, but I would actually argue that we work as much on the domestic agenda as we do on the foreign policy agenda. Um, there are numerous activities back home, which is about preparing Denmark for four, the fourth industrial revolution. And one of the things that we're doing is actually linking up with a lot of the ministries back home or at the authorities where the, whether it's the ministry for Philipa or the Ministry for transportation or the Ministry for health care. And the thing we're doing with them is it's both to be sort of a Ford operating posts in the epicenter of new technology. So basically being out there collecting information during small analysis, you know, telling a colleagues back home, you better be aware that, you know, Google is looking at the retina scanning for diabetes patients.

Speaker 5:          00:50:06       You know, that that will have an impact also on the way we treat, uh, patients back home. How do we propel our health care systems for that kind of new technologies coming? Yeah. A theater, the attorney. So very soon. So, so being that sort of beacon out there, bringing information back home, I think face an incredibly important part in both changing the mindset back home, but in fact also in a very practical way help look at, you know, is all legislation prepared for those opportunities or the areas where we want to work with, with Google or other companies to make sure that when you do healthcare or when you do education that we, that we get it right. So it also fits together with, with our approach. Um, I don't know whether you know this, but Uber was introduced in Denmark and then it was a band, uh, I think, uh, more or less a year after its introduction, uh, for, for a number of different reasons and eloquent to say that, that my office had, had been in existence a five years ago, that it would have fixed everything.

Speaker 5:          00:51:02       What I would argue though is that I think Uber is a pretty good example of a new technology or new platform coming into Europe coming into Denmark where have, had we had a tech ambassador or my office a few years ago, we could have identified that and said, well, let's work with the Ministry of Transportation back home or the appropriate authorities and see what we can do. Uh, what are the, what are the fine lines, what are the red lines for Denmark? And then have a dialogue with a headquarters over here to make sure there's not introduced in the wrong way. And I think that should be an interest of the companies, but it's certainly also in the interest of the, of a country our size. Did you notice how I avoided answering exactly how I know,

Speaker 6:          00:51:42       good positive answer to I'm sure other existing challenge to thank you.

Speaker 5:          00:51:46       No, but to be honest with you, it's not always easy, but I think in any organization or any, any big industry, you know, there's always resistance when you're trying to things in, in a new way that we've experienced that. But I think, I think the, the goal is so important that we get this right. Um, that, uh, you know, eventually it will, it will cause a lot of changes both in mindsets and also how we do business. And, and we've seen this just under 12 months within the underway.

Speaker 3:          00:52:13       I want to make sure we get through all our questions. Sure. People aren't lining up. So over here,

Speaker 6:          00:52:19       hi, my name's Jimmy. Uh, I'm a former Googler and my question is, um, you know, anyone who's been paying attention to the news has seen there's like increasing evidence that Russia, for example, is using technology platforms, whether it's Twitter or Facebook advertising platforms to try to influence democracies. Um, do you see that these sorts of geopolitical conflicts have a risk of increasingly spilling over into tech? And, uh, what would, uh, you know, what's your expectation or, um, the Danish foreign ministries expectation for Google and other tech companies role? You know, is it as a neutral arbiter or would you expect them to take proactive measures and these sorts of conflicts?

Speaker 3:          00:53:04       Yeah, got that question. Super quick question. And, and it, it enables me to say that I think we realized that cyber issues, uh, is, is, uh, is not something that will go away. In fact, it might increase over the next couple of years. Also, as we digitalize more and more parts of our societies. And, and of course we are, you know, Mike government has set this repeating, we're extremely concerned about the way Russia is operating in, in the cyber security arena. And we need, uh, to have better defensive mechanisms, but we also need international collaboration to try and sort of mitigate these issues. These are not small, um, you know, destructive incident. This is about potentially metalink with, uh, with elections or undermining public confidence in institutions, et cetera. So these are relationships that we'd take extremely seriously. We need an international collaboration. Um, also to make sure that, that those maligned actors that are actually performing these things, that they are brought out in the open and, and in in the right circumstances that we have attribution in that case.

Speaker 3:          00:54:07       But we also, and that's to answer the last part of your question. We certainly expect the industry to take a responsibility in this area and we know it's incredibly complex and if there is a, you know, a very fine line between a meddling with the freedom of speech and freedom of expression and then of course removing content that you identify positively as being a, you're not truthful or, or basically a based on so it doesn't exist. Um, and I think that that dilemma is going to be be important to try and, and find the silver bullet for, it's not good to be said, but we're going to put a lot of the efforts into it and we expect and we are going to work very hard to make sure that the industry also plays a part. It's part. Thank you. So we are at time, however, I would like to if possible, and I get an okay from the control room back there, um, to, um, to get the last few questions for. So over here.

Speaker 8:          00:55:03       Hi, I'm Kira and I actually just joined a Google New York from Google, Denmark. So I have Lyft and works in Denmark for about year and a half. And in the last 10 years that was the 10th country in which I lived and work. Uh, so what I see is that there's actually this growing population of people who, you know, they might not be just digital nomads, but obviously that's, you know, part of the group as well, uh, who are kind of, you know, in different countries and obviously they're experiencing the digitalization level in different countries differently. Uh, and what I noticed this is that actually no country that I've lived and work in, they really think in any way about people like that who actually have their presence beyond the country. So I know that officer Denmark has done a lot, and with like Estonia with, they're like east citizenships, you know, they're looking at that as well. Uh, but I have kind of a two fold question. Like, could you share and you know, is this part of a discussion where people are becoming more globalized and they're not really looking at any single one country, uh, as like the source of truth of their identity or of their digital identity? And number two, you know, do you feel that you, in your position, can you actually do something about that or are you having these discussions in your circles as well?

Speaker 3:          00:56:20       Oh, enormously difficult. A question. Um,

Speaker 5:          00:56:24       what I would say is that I think you represent, uh, a group which is growing in numbers. So these years, um, I think if you look at it from a, from a country point of view, uh, what there is renewed focus on is that we need people like you with skills and competencies to help, you know, drive the economy and built the new technology companies. And I can tell you very honestly that I haven't met a single Dane is tech company wares and said, well, we're in desperate need for, you know, skills and competencies that are very difficult to find even in Europe or in Copenhagen or wherever it might be. Stockholm is throwing. Yeah. Um, so on so forth. So I think a lot of focus we'll, we'll go into, into that direction both to make sure we educate a new generation that has the right skill sets to, to work in a digital world, but also to make sure that we can attract the kind of competencies that we need for, for the companies.

Speaker 5:          00:57:14       The problem is of course it's a global competition. You know, when you sit in, in Silicon Valley, I don't think I met any company where they said, well, it's damn difficult to find, you know, the right engineers or the software engineers that, that we need. The competition is fierce. And I think that competition will become increasingly a global. So we also need global solutions to, to those aspects. Whether I can do anything in that dimension. Well, I think what we can do is to bring back information and knowledge that these are discussions that are taking place or some on the, you know, the next generation of tech savvy people that we would like to, to attract to Denmark. Um, we, we can't offer any good weather and Denmark, but you know, the city is not too bad and you can bike around to everywhere. So there are, there are pros and cons. So perhaps we need to be better at branding their mark or so because of the weather, but because of the quality of life as well.

Speaker 3:          00:58:05       And that's where he can pay me back money if which page, then capital. All right. I know we're way over time, but last question from over here.

Speaker 9:          00:58:14       Uh, hi, my name is Tim. I'm a software engineer here. Um, my question is, uh, you know, traditionally when new technologies came into space, we generally didn't have an investor, right? We didn't have an investor, JC standard oil. Um, and, uh, you know, traditionally when you want to do get access to technology or to skillset, you would usually work with the State Department or whatnot of whatever country. And through that you'd create economic, you know, deals or whatnot. And so, and that's been the case I guess until now to some extent. So another way of asking the same question as um, uh, like what's, uh, I understand the initiative of trying to, you know, outreach to the tech industry, but can you give me an idea of, of like a, what's the urgency coming from to some extent?

Speaker 3:          00:59:05       Yeah, really a relevant question and perhaps I can begin by giving a, give you a example of the kind of critique that we've been faced with a the first year. Um, it's, it's quite often that we are being asked, so are you now putting companies before countries? So in other words, is this, you know, elevating Google tour a defect or a state without having, you know, democracies below it and all of that. And, and my reply to that, or I'll reply to that is always, well this is in fact about trying to protect the role of states in the future governance because I think governance is going to come under a lot of threat there or a face, a lot of challenges because of the kind of platforms that you guys are building and rolling out. It doesn't respect the national border assess. Perhaps some of the older industries would.

Speaker 3:          00:59:50       But I think the real, you know, the, the pertinent part of your question is why is it different now than it was, you know, 50 years ago when the oil industry began to roll out. And that I think is because of the piece. So, so I do think that, you know, I don't want to call it an exponential, but I think what we're seeing is incredibly fast pace of the new platforms we rolled out. The way that, uh, the technology basically penetrates everything we do, all sectors. Uh, it doesn't matter whether you're in construction or whether you're in health care technology is going to be a game changer potentially within a very short time span. So I think that's the reason why we think time is ripe and it is something different than, than oil. Uh, I think data is not a finite resource, so you'll continue to sort of expand and build on that and it gives enormous opportunities. Um, edit might also challenge our country like Denmark or the European Union or the United Nations in a more profound way than what we've seen with some previous technologies. So, so that's at least our argumentation that this is different. It feels different, and therefore we need a different, a reply or response to that. And that reply or response in our case, uh, is, is part of [inaudible] is here to do.

Speaker 3:          01:01:02       Okay. Well, thank you. Thank you. Thank you everybody. Uh, if you could give her a hand,

Speaker 10:         01:01:09       Casper.
