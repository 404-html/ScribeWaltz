Speaker 1:          00:06          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:13          So first of all, thank you all for coming today and thanks for having me again. Uh, APP. Google is always very nice to be here. Um, so I've written a few books now and this latest one, the Nordic baking book, you'd actually marks the end, uh, to a six year research process that produced the Nordic cookbook after three years and now finish this with this publication. And it's, um, the whole purpose of these books were to be documentary and to tell people about Nordic food culture in a true way because I think that Nordic food culture is one of the most misunderstood food cultures on the planet. I mean, uh, largely because of people like myself actually, because if you, um, if you search on the Internet for a Nordic food culture in order to cooking things like that, uh, the first thing you get up is like a thousand articles about Favi. Again, the noma and a handful of other very ambitious contemporary restaurants and none of them really are very indicative of how people actually in the Nordics. Um, and then aside of that, you also get the whole bunch of recipes for a gravlax for hiring and for meatballs and cinnamon buns. And those are Nordic dishes. But that's not really what people need them and everyday basis either. And then the last thing, you get this like a lot of people photographing their meatball Mila at Ikea.

Speaker 2:          01:40          So I felt that, uh, there was a real need for these books and it's been an enormous privilege to get to spend this long, uh, supported by publisher researching, researching my own food culture, the food culture that I thought I knew a lot about and that it turned out that I knew a lot less than I thought about. Um, and, uh, it's, it is a bit strange now to see this, both books, outs, um, the project being done. But it's also amazing to see people interact with both of the books, tagging me in photos on social media of bands. They've made people coming to these lectures and, uh, really learning about food culture that I think they knew very little about before. And one thing that I learned, especially during the second half of this project is how great the diversity and the depth of Nordic Bacon culture. And I come to believe very firmly that Nordic baking culture is actually the greatest bacon culture on the planet today in terms of diversity and depth. And that might sound a little bit less than obvious for most people. Uh, and, uh, my plan now is that I'm going to spend the next 30 minutes or so talking about sort of making my case for Nordic Bacon Culture and then, uh, I'll open up for some questions towards, towards the end.

Speaker 1:          03:05          Do we have a problem? Sorry, Justin. No, Dustin. Um, so the,

Speaker 2:          03:18          the best place to start when we talk about culture, it's the people because without people, we can't have any culture baking or otherwise. And the Nordic region, it's inhabited by about 26 million people and they're spread out the a surface area just under 3.5 million square kilometers. And that column by any stretch be called, particularly then as they populated, I mean, uh, we can compare this to, for example, the whole rest of Europe without the Nordics, which would then have about 90 people per square kilometer. It's even more interesting if you start comparing to specific countries. Uh, let's say France for example, France has 116 people per square kilometer. Germany, the most populous country in Europe has 237 people per square kilometer. And as a little example, to compare it to two, if you were to take all of the Germans and you have to spread them out in an even layer across their whole country, you would end up having a German every 75 knee jerk in every direction, one even layer.

Speaker 2:          04:26          If you were to do the same in the Nordic region, there will be 375 meters between each person. And that's a huge difference. So we have this vast geographical area with a very, very scarce population. Um, I mean if we were to go back in time, let's say a few hundred years to, uh, to an era when a lot of what we consider our cultural identity of today was actually founded, what would this scarcity of your population actually have meant for the way that knowledge was transmitted between people and anyone? Give me some examples perhaps. What do you think, what would this mean? Think before like social media, television, cell phones, all of this stuff.

Speaker 1:          05:17          Anyone else?

Speaker 2:          05:20          A lot of word of mouth. I mean the, the, the, I think that the, um, the most important sort of general observation about the difference between now and then we'll be that, uh, information, knowledge everywhere would have been transmitted at a much lower pace back then than it is now. And as you say, word of mouth, you essentially had to talk face to face, to a person to acquire the information that they might have a or you had to write the letter. And I think that, I mean, we can all agree that writing a physical letter, although it's a beautiful thing, a, is not a particularly efficient way of lots of information quickly or I mean the third option, if she wanted to learn from a trusted source, you could also read a book. And back then, I mean 300 years ago there were like three books.

Speaker 2:          06:07          One was the Bible and then there were two more that didn't deal with baking Heider. So, uh, I mean none of these things would have actually, uh, um, really done much for the cultural baking. So if we were to agree, then that information flowed slower everywhere because of the lack of technology. I think we can also imagine that in an area as scarcely populated as the Nordic region, this effect would have been further exaggerate them simply because series just much more distance between each person that you can interact with face to face. And this is very important for my recently and it's something that I will come back to a little bit later. Um, and now I'm going to make an example as well, sort of to illustrate this. And so I have a, my good friend Joe on here tonight is it's there in the back. He happened to be San Francisco today, so he just came here to have a little look as well. And let's say that Yo one tomorrow would invent a new cake recipe and he's not just any cake recipe. It's actually the most delicious cake recipe ever invented by humankind. It's completely revolutionary. Um,

Speaker 2:          07:17          and he would bake this cake recipe. Maybe he would share it with his family and he would do what most people do today when they do something they're proud of some, some kind of achievement, he would share it on social media.

Speaker 2:          07:33          And because of this key, and it's extreme deliciousness, I mean, everyone who sees it on social media, they're a bit excited because, I mean, he's claiming that he's made the world's best cake, right? And perhaps a few of them will ask for the recipe and they will do the same thing. They were also bake it and little by little sort of information generation by information generation. Um, this cake recipe spreads out into the world and then all of a sudden maybe, uh, you know, it hit someone with a bit of, you know, a bit more reach, perhaps a couple of hundred thousand followers and it gets even further out into the world of information. And all of a sudden it's featured in Martha Stewart living, I mean, no one's cake recipe. And then it takes one more week and it's my birthday back home in Sweden and Tova my wife, who has also done a lot of the, uh, recipe development for these two books.

Speaker 2:          08:26          She's made birthday cake, but it's not my normal birthday cake, which is the green Marzipan layer cake, which is, you know, the princess cake, the most delicious birth, the birthday cake, the race, I think. No, no, it's another one. It's a new one, but it's not Yo, when's cake either. It's the Vegan raw food version of your landscape that Toby has gotten from her goop newsletter. And, and that's sort of how information flows today when it comes to, um, food much, much. And not only does it spread quicker, lead more quickly over a large area, it also mutates quicker into new versions of itself. And this is a huge difference. I mean, this isn't, hasn't been going on for very long. And if we were to compare this with how things were back couple of hundred years ago, I mean, you're one could still have invented the cake. It will there be an equally delicious as most today.

Speaker 2:          09:19          Uh, he would have made it for his family and then like, that would have been it, right? And then perhaps a, when your hands kids were to leave the house, you know, after 20 years of eating his cake, uh, perhaps they got married into the neighboring farm 800 meters away. Um, another four people with I learned about the cake. So in, in, you know, in the span of 20 years, it would have a spread, you know, spread over a diameter of two kilometers and eight people would have known about the case. The most delicious cake invented by human guide. Uh, and I mean, this is a bit of an over exaggerating, but I think, I think that if you get the point, um, and to put this simply, a scarce population spread out over a vast area used to me and to some extent still means today that knowledge travels slower, um, this and it's turn, it will always mean that you get the more varied expression of all commonly practiced culture. This is simply because people are less influenced by charter because they, you know, do less of the same stuff. And this is one reason to why the Nordic region has a more diverse baking culture than almost any other region in the world.

Speaker 2:          10:30          And other reason for this diversity, um, that is also somewhat related to the Scarsdale population and we'd really influences the, uh, making culture. It's the bakeries and their role in society. And in the Nordics baking culture, it's not carried primarily by commercial bakeries, but rather by people in their homes. And this is not just something that used to be accurate in the past. It's salty. It's something that still applies today. And, and this is, I mean, it has to do with geography because what does bakeries need to sustain themselves? Customers. Exactly. I mean, they're going to need to have people there. And if you have a 375 meters through, you know, every person that's not many. Um, and I mean there are definitely bakeries in the Nordics. There's always been bakeries in the Nordics, but there are concentrated in quite a small geographical area. At least they used to be historically. Um, I mean you would have found most of these bakeries that were, uh, sort of common enough to produce red as a daily staple in cities. And most of the cities in the Nordics are in the southern third of Sweden, a bit on the, uh, sort of southwest coast of Finland. All of them, mark and then an area or you know, around Oslow and a bit up on the west coast of Norway. That's where you would have found these cities that were big enough to sustain. Baker is in the past.

Speaker 2:          12:01          And I actually did a little test when I did another talk that was on a completely different subjects. Uh, yes. Some weeks ago I had 100 people in the room and I ask them all what they thought was the greatest bacon culture on the planet. None of them's the Nordic. What do you guys think? They said? Yeah, they said the France or 99 of them said France. And then there was this one guy who was an Austrian. And I mean, I started thinking about this and, and I think that I would've said Francis, well, before starting with this project and I started thinking more about, I mean, what, why did, why does everyone think this? Like what's the substance behind, uh, this immediate assumption from almost every person you meet? The French Bacon culture is the greatest, greatest on the planet. I think that this simply a case and a great example, or very, very clever and successfully executed branding exercise by the French.

Speaker 2:          13:07          You know, you visit France, uh, there is, uh, but gets you buy them, they're already clarity by them. And then you'll have a great time in France. Um, and I mean, if we start to look at what French baking culture actually is, it's the polar opposite to with Nordic Pagan culture. Looks like I would on something strange. Oh, good. Um, as opposed to ours, uh, the French baking culture is almost entirely driven by professional bakeries. People in France, they don't bake that much at home. And I mean, why would they? Um, there's a bakery in every tiny little village in France and France is very evenly and quite densely populated as we said before. So I mean, there's absolutely no incentive to bake your own bread, uh, on a, on a regular basis so that it becomes a daily staple.

Speaker 2:          14:03          And if we take this a step further and think about what this actually means for the culture of eating and baking bread, um, I imagine that many in this room, perhaps almost all of you have been to France and you've bought and eaten something from a French bakery. Perhaps you were there on vacation. I mean, perhaps you live there for awhile. I don't know. Uh, but I think that most of us can agree that French bakeries are lovely places. I mean, the gets the butter across som to partial Kula Africa turnovers flow path. I mean, all of these things are examples of great, great pastries and bakes. And I too love a French bakery. I mean, I used to live there. Uh, I've been to a lot of them and not just in Paris where I live, but all over the country. And when I started thinking about these things, one thing that I realized that there are pretty much all the same.

Speaker 2:          15:02          They share almost exactly the same repertoire of baked goods regardless of where in France they are. And I mean, sure, the butter roll into a croissant in Brittany might be a little bit saltier than the one I was at. A Nice, perhaps the apricots are fresh in the south and their cabin in the north. And there are definitely some regional variations and some, uh, uh, regional specialties that are added on to this standard repertoire across the country. But all in all, they are remarkably similar. And as I said before in France, people rarely bake at home. And if they do, they bake, uh, the search, you know, might go to a, the bakery by a role of a puff pastry and go home and make telethon. That's sort of the extent of it.

Speaker 2:          15:50          And I mean, as you can understand, this is a not exactly a great growing ground for a in cultural, cultural individuality and diversity. And I mean, this is because businesses, bakeries are businesses and the businesses they have to function financially. And I mean this happens when you find that sweet spot between what people want to buy and what's actually possible to produce in a, an efficient enough manner. So there is always going to be, for all cultures, cultures dominated by businesses, certain, uh, circumstances and rules around them that will shape and quite the large degree streamline these places produce. And I think that very often we'd food, we tend to forget this because we were so, I mean, we take that for granted and we don't really see food as part of normal business even though it is obviously. And I think you can make, um, a bit of a, an interesting comparison with, for example, other types of manufacturing.

Speaker 2:          16:52          Let's say that you compare bakeries and car companies. So almost all car companies except for some cosmetic differences make essentially the same product, right? Rectangular box wheel in each corner. It goes either like that or like that. Then you know, it, they kind of do the same thing. Um, and the same rules apply there because they're a business, you know, uh, and they've collected, we figure out the best way of producing something that's as close as possible to where people want to buy. And it's exactly the same for the bakeries. And also most bakeries, they're run by bakers and most bakers who run Baker's, they've also gone to school somewhere where they learned how to debate. Incidentally, they learn how to bake exactly the same way as pretty much all of the others who also went to school and started bakeries. And because their business model works and has worked for a long time, most likely what they're going to teach the next generation of bakers is some iteration of what they're already doing. And none of this really promotes diversity and culture.

Speaker 2:          17:59          Um, so in a bacon culture driven by bakeries, you will inevitably only have a fraction of the diversity found in a culture that's driven by people baking in the home. And this is another reason why there is no more diverse, diverse baking culture in the world than in the Nordics. And I actually think that a comparison between the u s and Sweden here and we get it straight, it's the differences in how much people actually bake at home. Because something that I've understood here in the US now when we've done all of the recipe testing with independent recipe testers in America to see that the recipe is actually function. And also something that I've come to a talk a little about you bring this tour when we were meeting people and talking about the book is that um, it's hard to buy fresh yeast here.

Speaker 2:          18:46          I mean, essentially it seems to me that if you want to buy fresh yeast in America, you have to sort of sneak up in the alley behind some bakery and like go in the back door and buy some of their yeast stash, you know, uh, which is very different from how it will be in, for example, Sweden where you can buy fresh yeast and every grocery store, every petrol station, every seven, 11, many new stands, we'll have fresh cheese that is not just because they have a pretty yellow color, the cubes and you know, people have them for fun. It's because people buy them and people buy them because they want to bake with them. Um, and I think that this illustrates how big a part of, um, people sort of home cooking, baking makes out in the Nordic region. And then you'll have geography and climate.

Speaker 2:          19:31          Another very important influence on what people eat. And as I said before, the Nordics, it's a vast region. I mean from the southern most bits of Denmark all the way up to the northern parts of Spitsbergen islands, north of Norway, from Finland in the east to green. Then all the way in the West is a huge region and you can fit all of the rest of Europe a whole bunch of times in there. I think you can fit the whole universe in there as well. Easily and sure. I mean a lot of this is ocean, but that doesn't really matter because when it comes to cultural diversity, uh, dependent on the geography, it's not, you know, the important thing is not that it's evenly populated. Important thing is the distance between the extremes where people actually live and in terms of climate naturally in such a vast area, you will also have a lot of variation and this and it's turn.

Speaker 2:          20:23          It will mean that people are what people have been able to grow in the past and thereby bake wood and integrate into our culture. It's very, the lot depending on where they live. And you can think of wheat, for example, we this a grain that needs a fairly particular circumstances to grow. Well, we need a long enough in a warm enough summer, it needs quite a lot of water and it needs very fertile ground to grow well. And these circumstances you won't find everywhere in the Nordic region. You'll actually find them pretty much in that same region where all of those CPS were located. Funnily, you know, um, so in the southern third of Sweden, a little bit on the, uh, uh, finished west coast a little bit, didn't South Norway and all over Denmark. That's where we was traditionally grown. And it's also where most of the wheat based recipes in traditional Nordic baking happens to come from.

Speaker 2:          21:19          And funnily enough, what used to be, uh, you know, practical limitations on, in this essence, this in the past, it tends to inform our choices today a lot. And then you can go on and you can look at, for example, Denmark. So Denmark has the most fertile farmland in the Nordics. It's a great agricultural production area. And they grow a lot of weeds. And wheat has always been a, an important trade commodity, very expensive. So what they used to do historically is that they grew the weeds on their best land and then they sold it off to continental Europe, almost all of it. And on all of the poorer pieces of land, instead of wheat, they grew ry because ry, it ripens very dependently every summer in Denmark. And the therefore have a really great ride bread culture. And because southern Sweden is close to Denmark, you'll also find a bit of Rye bread there.

Speaker 2:          22:16          And you'll find in both Denmark and South Sweden breads that you historically wouldn't have found anywhere else, which were brands that had both rye and wheat in them because unique to this area. And then you can look at Finland. Finland has almost all rye, almost no other grains are used in traditional finish baking. And this is because most of the countries located too far north. So it's too cool in the summer for a, the wheat to grow there. And then in the, in the sort of southern part, the warmest part of Finland, um, it's, it's, it has inland climate towards the Russian border. So even if it would have been warm enough for the week to grow there in the summer would have been long enough. It's too dry so it doesn't work. But Rye, it can take a lot less water during the summer so they have, uh, you know, it and it informs all of their bacon culture where I grew up further north up in Sweden, uh, you can't grow wheat because it's too cool and the summer you can't grow rye either for the same reason. So people use to grow oats and barley and oats have, it has no gluten at all in it. And Barley, we'll have a little bit of gluten and gluten. You need to make fluffy breads. So the further north you come in Scandinavia, the flatter the bread's will be. You know, until you hit the point, sort of halfway up through Sweden and Norway where I used to grow up, um, where the traditional Bates would be only flatbreads, either soft or dry.

Speaker 2:          23:42          And I mean, I'm going to compare this to France again. Yes. Because it's a, it's a very easy comparison to make. So what Greens do we find in France? It's like wheat everywhere. They grow almost exclusively weeds, I mean, and why would they grow anything else? Uh, pretty much all of the country except for like the warmers and DIYers bits towards the southeast as a great growing climate for weeds and wheat is in Europe and has traditionally been the most well paid for grain crop. But then you look at, you know, the repertoire or recipes, almost all of the recipes for both the breads and savory pastries in France. They're based on one single grain, which is sweet. If you look all of the Nordics, I mean we've had four different grains who've all been, you know, equally important to specific parts of the region.

Speaker 2:          24:38          Meaning that we have four times as much base material to work with, meaning more diversity. We can do the questions afterwards. Sorry. So these sort of climate and it's, it's limiting factors has historically created a lot of diversity. Uh, and as, as I said before, the Nordic region is also vast, but it's a vast region that's located almost all of it in the marginal climates and it's marginal in a sense that for people to successfully live there, you know, you have to plan ahead a little bit. You can't just expect to harvest plant based foods all throughout the year, which we, which we shouldn't be the case and quite a large part of the military and Mediterranean area. Um, you know, a big part of Asia for example, and a lot of warmer climates in the world, you wouldn't really have any incentive to, um, store foods, at least not for a longer period of time.

Speaker 2:          25:37          And the interesting thing with all of these marginal climates, it doesn't really matter where you are in the world. They have two product groups in common that have been like a huge historical importance. Um, and essentially things that made people live through the harsh winters. And those two product groups. There are grains and dairy and both grains and dairy. There are not only high in energy, but they're also very easily produced in large quantities during fairly cool summers. And on top of that, both grains and dairy there are easily prepared for storage. I mean with there you can think like culture, their products, butter, cheese, all things that keep really well and all things that are very dense in energy so they don't talk, they don't take up a lot of storage space when you keep them. Uh, for the cereals. I mean all seeds of perennial grasses make great storage crop.

Speaker 2:          26:36          They dry well, um, the store well and they can be turned into a lot of different things. And it doesn't matter. I mean, if you're a in the Peruvian Andes, if you're in a monastery, in Bhutan, in the Himalayas, or if you're like in a suburb of us too soon where I grew up, it doesn't matter if it's a corn or a red rice or wheat or if it's milk from a lama or York or cow. The same sort of basic principles apply all of these marginal climates. And I think that baking, which I thought was going to be very easy to define, the baking is turns out that is not easy to define at all. And I think that baking is simply like a catch all phrase for all of the ways that humankind can, uh, turn grains sometimes in the combination with dairy into a food.

Speaker 2:          27:28          How we can turn, can turn a these two basic product groups into something that's more easily digestible, more tasty and more varied than, you know, the products are on their own. And I think that the fact that we've created so much variation with such a limited number of base products as we have in baking compared to savory food, I mean, just imagine how almost all baking recipes, they contain like the same five things in different variations. And if you look at the savory cooking, you have thousands of different based products that, you know, becomes various combinations. And I think that there's great diversity in number of recipes and expressions in baking. It really, uh, uh, says a lot about how important and how big a part of our daily caloric intake that used to come from grains and dairy. You know, we were really, really motivated to create a lot of diversity in recipes.

Speaker 2:          28:23          So today, uh, we often tell ourselves that we decide what we eat all the time that no one else dictates what products we buy and what we make from them. And from my perspective, this is obviously completely wrong because I mean, we are animals and we do exactly what our species is always done. We, we procure whatever products that make sense to us there and then, and we prepared them in whatever way that makes sense to us there. And then, and then we eat them ourselves or with our flock. I mean, that's what we do. And the thing though that fascinates me so much with this, especially when it comes to baking, it's the amount of cultural knowledge that transmitted between generations because eating correctly, grown, preserved, stored, and subsequently prepared foods made from grains and dairy, it used to be incredibly important for ancestors.

Speaker 2:          29:19          Uh, for them it was a simply about survival, which is the single strongest motivating force of the human being today for almost all of us eating breads and cakes and buns and cookies or whatever else we've baked, it's mostly about pleasure. Right? Um, and why do we find it's so pleasurable? The EEC explanation here is that these items are dentists in energy and that we are predisposed to like things that are dentists in energy and that might explain why we find a piece of cookie, very tasty, but it doesn't explain why we're so motivated to pass on this cultural information between generation and why it's so pleasurable to bake. And I think that's simply a are you know, humankind's sort of, um, function put in flight in place by humankind in our subconscious minds to make sure that we don't lose this information. Yes. Because there's a new generation coming.

Speaker 2:          30:20          Um, I mean almost everyone I know take more pleasure and they feel more satisfied when they've baked something than when they've cooked something savory. I mean personally I'm more happy, but you know, when I bake a sponge cake than one day, then when I'm making an oven omelettes. Um, and I think this is just a really good a indicator, you know, on, uh, how our minds function. And this sort of boils down to my final big reason as to why the Nordic Bacon culture truly is the greatest around there. Uh, preparing all of these grains and dairy products. Well, it's used to be more important where I come from than in almost any other part of the world. And I think this is also the reason why most people in the Nordics still bake more in their homes, then people doing other parts of the world.

Speaker 2:          31:11          We just take more pleasure in it because it used to be more important for us in the past. And as we'd all culture, I mean, if culture is regularly practiced, you know, on an everyday basis, if culture is allowed to, um, uh, change gradually because of use, it will always be more diverse and deeply rooted than if it's carried out by the Sfu people or you know, uh, kept intact in a bubble. And I think this is like the final reason from my side too. Why, uh, the Nordic Bacon culture is just the most diverse making culture on the planet today. Thank you.

Speaker 1:          31:50          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          31:58          and now we can do questions. Do we have in Miker? Yeah. Cool. And it can be questions about this, uh, about the project with these books. They can be questions about Favi and my restaurant can be questions about anything you want really. So Rachel Hanson,

Speaker 3:          32:13          you mentioned that sort of during the process for researching this entire project that, uh, you thought at the beginning, you knew a lot about serving more include culture in order to compete and culture, but you found that you need a lot less than, what are some examples of some particularly interesting things that you learned?

Speaker 2:          32:31          For me, the, uh, the most interesting I learned was actually how much diversity there south there. Um, because I, I mean, first of all, there's no such thing as a common Nordic identity. Uh, I don't know if, I mean there are some Nordic people here for sure. I mean there might be more, but I think all, all of us living in the Nordic region, we, uh, we feel a strong identity connected to where we're from, but that's usually not like, hey, I'm Nordic. You know, I'm Swedish. Um, and I think that because of this we might not have been sort of receptive to, uh, uh, be sort of our neighboring cultures as much as we should have. At least that's sort of applies to me. And just traveling around, you know, meeting people in their homes, uh, talking about food, seeing what the actually cook and bake on an everyday basis. Uh, it's just been eye opening. How much, you know, difference in cultural diversity is out there.

Speaker 3:          33:27          What's the difference in bread between hand kneading it and he's a kitchen aid.

Speaker 2:          33:31          Uh, I mean the kitchen aid specifically, it's a one way of machine needing but, and you know, it has a specific expression because of the size of the bowl and the way moves. But I think that if we look at like machine process versus hand processed, like theoretically there has to be no difference. Like it doesn't have to be any difference. Um, and uh, because the doe doesn't know what's going on to it, you know, and, and there is a lot of different machines that can take care of this and this is something that I've spoken to a lot of bakers about and, uh, very begrudgingly and most of them agree that the machine should be able to do with exactly as well as a human being, but then they were a hundred parts of the, uh, uh, baking process that machines at least not yet are able to replicate perfectly.

Speaker 3:          34:17          In your research, did you find any regional difference? It's when the difference depending on where they've grown up thinking about all. Okay. What about different kinds of brands? Different coming from different parts at least at all, just so mixed into processing. We don't really know.

Speaker 2:          34:38          The thing is that, I mean, if you look further back, there was more regional diversity when, when farmers would take and produce their own seed from their crop and then receive that next year, you would have a larger degree of genetic of the diversity and whatever was produced in various regions, not just grains, but today, I mean for the last hundred plus years, uh, pretty much all of the commercial growers of cereal crops used to same handful of, uh, varieties. Um, and in this book it's about this documentary, a object about what people bake today at home, meaning that most of the research has also been into what people use at home, which is largely the same types of flour. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          35:26          I just got, it would be interesting to have terroir of different,

Speaker 2:          35:29          it will be very interesting to have terroir of different grains, but it's actually nonexistent. Yeah. Uh, I mean there are, we buy for to fabric and we buy a specific variety, so various grains from specific farms and we used up, but I mean, that's a very extreme expression of a baking. That's not a at all representative of where people bake in the home. And I think that's, we will most likely never have that type of variety in the home. Yes. For practical reasons. I mean, and then whether that's sad or whether it's efficient than good, I mean that's up to anyone. And for me, uh, I mean I love being part of making this book has also be too mean to sort of remove my opinions from the content matter, which is not easy all the time because when you run a restaurant like five weekend, it's all about pushing your agenda and your opinion and showcasing that in the food. But for it to be documentary and representative for the region that I had to sort of remove that therapeutic therapeutic, there's to make, I mean, I think that the pretty much all baking can be fairly therapeutic. I like making chocolate old new balls, uh, which is essentially butter and sugar and oatmeal and cocoa powder. And very rarely does it ever make it to the both stage. I mean, usually it's sort of just disappears. Meanwhile,

Speaker 3:          36:49          you mentioned earlier talking about the fresh sheets. I've definitely found it very frustrating. And following Nordic case because the expectations of like you mentioned that you did some testing changes. Did you find that you have to make are with, how did you acknowledge,

Speaker 2:          37:09          yeah, so it's actually, it's a bit complicated because as I said, it's a documentary books and none of the recipes have been adapted in any way. Uh, not, you know, to sort of better fit specific territories or even if, I mean I've seen a lot of recipes are, I'm like I can do that so much better if I change it to the bit, but I haven't done that. And the same thing goes here. So what I've done though is that I written narrative texts and I sort of provided information on some of these topics. Like I written how yeast functions for example, and what the differences would be between freshmen right east. And then we explain that a little bit in how to substitute and how to work with that. I written about the variation in different flowers because there's a huge difference in flowers across the world, not just the thing in American counterparts, but everywhere. And even within the u s there's a big difference in how flower behaves. And then there is also other recipes you know what to do if you don't have a giant wood fired brick oven for example, when you make bad breads and stuff like that. Um, but it, this documentary and the recipes as such, they are exactly as they are in the Nordic region.

Speaker 3:          38:09          I'm really curious to hear more about the interaction of identity and nationality. Um, do you do if the case that um, there's not a sort of, there hasn't been an this, this identity of a culture because there's so much regional diversity and then also on the other side you're, your books are branding this idea of Nordic cuisine or are you, do you think there a broader Nordic identity you'd be on the national

Speaker 2:          38:36          identity that is emerging or that you would like to see? I think that it's always been there. It's just that, you know, I was living there. We don't like to acknowledge it because we feel more strongly for our specific national identity rather than like your common Nordic one and the common and the Nordic region. I mean it's a geographical region. It's not a cultural region. Um, but there are a lot of things that sort of bind us together a culturally as well. Um, but they're equally many things that sort of tell us apart. And one interesting thing that you can see when it comes to the, you know, where people used to cook and still cooks today and as well for that matter is that at at this sort of base you have these uh, claim math. Again, geographical differences. That's a constant, that's just there.

Speaker 2:          39:21          And then on top on top of that you'll have a geographic or a cultural layer as well, like a little cultural filter that informs a, you know, what people do with these geographical circumstances. And most of that I would say it actually depends on whom occupied whom in the past. Um, which is sort of strange and a bit interesting and funny, but you can divide the Nordic region into two cultural regions. One that's Swedish influenced and that's like from Sweden and then Finland and around the Baltics or the Baltic countries in Poland. And they're not part of the Nordics anymore, but they have a very distinctive sort of Swedish, uh, influence on that cultural layer, on top of the geography. And then the western bit would have the same with Danish influence. And it really shows because in that cultural legion, for example, you have green than the Faroe Islands and Iceland, I mean green than a Faroe islands are still part of Denmark.

Speaker 2:          40:16          Iceland was occupied by then more for many, many years. Uh, none of these islands, um, would have ever seen any green before the deans came because the climates, you know, it doesn't really support growing grains. Uh, and there are so isolated. But today they have a bread culture and you can trace almost all of it back to the Danish cultural influence. All of these countries, they will have their own version, or for example, like the very iconic and Danish Rye bread, but made to suit their circumstances on Iceland, for example, the country that has almost no trees, the, uh, source of energy to heat the home was traditionally a peat moss that was dug out of a peat bog and lug it home and dry it and then burnt and obviously a very laborious process to create fuel, meaning that people weren't exactly inclined to fire up a giant brick oven to bake a loaf of bread.

Speaker 2:          41:14          So, I mean, before the Danes came there to, didn't really have any, any type of baked goods at all, uh, with the deans came people from Denmark who obviously lived on Iceland, uh, because it was occupied, you know, managing everything they wanted their bread. And Iceland has a lot of volcanic activity. So what people did instead was just dig holes in the ground outside of the villages and lower a bucket of Rye bread down into the hole, come back in the day after in the morning and pick up a loaf of steamed bread. And that still goes on today and he's very easy to think, you know, when you're in Iceland that, oh, they've been doing this for like a thousand years, but they haven't, you know, they'd been doing it for like 200 years, which is not very long and historic or historical perspective.

Speaker 3:          41:56          That's not so bad. What is your favorite recipe in this book?

Speaker 2:          42:00          I mean, as I said before, it's been, most of the process has been about me not imposing too much of my opinion on the content matter. Um, and the choice of recipes it entirely independent on what I think is good and bad. It's about what represents the most people in the region and the most parts of the regions as well as possible. But then naturally, I mean, there are recipes that for various reasons I personally feel more for and they will probably be things that has to do with my childhood. Like, yeah, soft Swedish flatbreads. For example, I'm going to chocolate balls I mentioned earlier. Um, and then things I didn't know existed, like the Icelandic Rye bread. Also to me very appealing if even if I've never baked it myself. I mean just the fact that it's sort of exists.

Speaker 3:          42:44          I have a question about flowers and you just have a recommendation for a resource professional or the non culinary school educated person. I love baking and Rick started, we have always been interested in alternative flours and I'm really interested more in wheat flours. Just the variation of the flowers and understanding of protein content and how they all interact and what brands to buy. Simple things like that. I find myself playing different places on the Internet and googling and I don't know what's right and I'm just wondering if there's a central resource that you would tell someone to go to. Oh, this is it. The education on flour.

Speaker 2:          43:22          Um, I don't have one specific one that's available here. Uh, and what I do know is that there is like a huge amount of difference, not just in what grains that are used to make flour, but also in the various processes use like how things are milled, uh, how things are age, how they are transported and so on. And it all affects how they bake in the end. So I think that the only thing that I can suggest just, I mean try buying flour, that seems to be good, you know, cause how many a hundred reasons then yes, the pure functionality, it might be that it's organic, that is mill close to where you live, whatever by that and then, um, use only that, I'm thinking you were learning how it behaves and then you'll be able to adapt recipes into that, you know? Um, and it's very hard to be general about these things because they, they, they differ so much and there are no, I mean, I haven't found any great books on this. There's lots of research papers. I mean, you can do it into like university, the search engines and you can look for things and read people's crappy abstracts about, you know, wheat kernels and things like that. Uh, and it is very interesting. Um, but maybe someone should write that though.

Speaker 3:          44:33          Just defined baking as the transformation and, uh, my family is a Norwegian word. I never, yes. To protect the rights. Well, never. Yes, potato. Yeah. Yeah. Is that it does anything about it.

Speaker 2:          44:59          [inaudible] is a, the traditional Norwegian flatbread and the big difference between left Sir and most of the other flat breads in the Nordic region is that they are griddled, they're not baked in an oven and uh, they also use other, it's not just flower based, I should say. Quite a few of them have potato in them. A lot of them have peas in them as well and things like that. And the reason why they're not oven bake this stuff, most of Norway, uh, it's a bit like Iceland in the sense that there are not any like large, deep forests in most of the country. And that's compared to Sweden for example, where like the generation, all my grand grandparents, I mean they all had a thousand hectares. So pine forest, you know, that was pretty much worthless. All it was good for was fire wood. So they had a lot of that. Then therefore we have a tradition of these great big brick ovens on every farm. There is one of those solo, our flatbreads are baked in that Norway, they didn't have access to a few in that way, so they had to be more energy efficient and a little fire under a grid. It'll, you know, it's a, it's a much more efficient way of baking flatbreads. So I think, yeah,

Speaker 3:          46:10          and your research, you try to cut off, like you said, uh, alternate his recipes. Are there any recipes or like red spade very far off regions of you worried about will kind of die out or anything that you want to do to preserve?

Speaker 2:          46:24          So this is also something that I realized during this process and before this I think that I was more on the sort of opinion that a traditional food culture is very important to preserve acidosis. And I've come to realize more and more that is actually, that's completely wrong because food culture has to be allowed to evolve and we will always, um, eat what makes sense to us wherever we are, whoever we are and whatever time it will be. Um, what's important though is to preserve the, uh, knowledge to make sure that food culture is properly and accurately documented because it's a waste of knowledge if it just sort of, you know, stops being practiced and then everyone just forgets about that. It might've taken a generations are thousands of years, was sort of empirical study and living to come up with a lot of these techniques. But, uh, and, and this is a, it's a hard thing actually because, uh, almost everyone has doesn't, you know, no, quite agree with me on this. Almost everyone, I think often thinking just sort of a says that's these traditional service. So important to keep allowing, but like who's going to keep them alive? I mean, in Sweden we have sour herring, for example, the stinkiest food on planet earth. Um, and I think that, I mean, wait 30 more years and it's going to be gone.

Speaker 3:          47:46          Okay.

Speaker 2:          47:47          And I'm not going to be sorry that it's gone, but I will be very sorry if the knowledge on how to make it will disappear. Yes. Because we don't eat it anymore.

Speaker 3:          47:55          No. Hello. It seems to me like a lot of us eat home cooked food everyday. I haven't seen that to the same standards and other pieces though. First of all. That's true.

Speaker 2:          48:23          I think, yeah, I think it's absolutely true. Uh, even today, I mean the, the, the development in the Nordic region, especially in the bigger cities are people eat more and more out. It becomes more and more like other parts of the world. Um, but we still eat a bigger part of our meals in the home cooked by ourselves than almost any other western culture does. And I think it has to do with the historically a lot of different reasons. One of them being scared of the population that is just not enough people in a large part of the region to sustain restaurants. And then I think that there are cultural factors on top of that as well as religion, for example, and many other things. Um,

Speaker 3:          49:05          yeah.

Speaker 2:          49:05          But what I do know though is that this is one of the reasons why Nordic food culture and making culture is so little understood because it's inaccessible, not just the way I spoke about before. With like stop a recorded information but also like the practical act of eating Nordic food. I mean if you go to Sweden for example, as a tourist and you go to stock and when you think to yourself, I'm going to have, you know, one traditional Swedish mean when I'm here, you're not going to get that is not a single restaurant in Stockholm that producers and uh, uh, something that's remotely close to like an authentic version or people eat in their homes.

Speaker 3:          49:39          Okay.

Speaker 2:          49:39          Cause that's not what restaurants are about in that region. And that differs a lot from um, central and southern Europe for example. I mean, it's very easy to go to Spain and go to a restaurant and find something that's definitely a bit adapted to the world of restaurants. But that fairly accurately represents the same thing as you would

Speaker 3:          49:59          cook at home. Yeah. The question also, is there any tradition of high altitude,

Speaker 2:          50:08          uh, we don't have that much high altitude in the Nordic region and, and where are we have a bit of altitude. Uh, I mean, in Sweden, I mean the, like, the tallest mountains are like 1500 or so meters and no one lives there. I mean, traditionally has no one lived up there. It's like we're, we're, I'm from, uh, which is considered quite high in altitude, is 350 meters. So, uh, so I don't have a specific, uh, any specific knowledge of it. I know that we had some feedback from like recipe test or something in Mexico City, for example. Uh, that a lot of the recipes behave very differently. Thank you guys for coming in today and thanks for [inaudible].
