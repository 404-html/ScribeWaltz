Speaker 1:          00:06          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:10          So today I'm really excited to have you here to talk a little bit, not just about the coffee, but your path to getting to where you have today, um, to talk to you guys and to see how Colby has been able to successfully live a life of work life balance, doing things that he's passionate about and really just like having an idea and going for it. So maybe we just start out talking about how you decided that you wanted to get into the business.

Speaker 3:          00:39          Sure. Thank you guys for all coming in. It's pretty, pretty awesome to be here in San Francisco at Google serving coffee to you all. Google is, um, I'll totally get to what you said. That's good. Yeah, Google is actually one of our first back in the day clients actually that a, we ever sold coffee to kind of, uh, more um, more big league client out of Santa Cruz. One of the first people we sold to a was on the original Google campus. And, uh, our 1950 blend in fact that we sell, one of our most popular selling blends was named after the 1950 [inaudible] building at Google. So big ups, but it's our trademark. So, uh, um, but so yeah, I mean I grew up not really, I guess in the bay area by then, that couple of hours north of San Francisco, uh, in an area.

Speaker 1:          01:38          MMM.

Speaker 3:          01:40          Kind of Napa, Mendocino, Lake County, Sonoma county families from Sonoma county. And I grew up, uh, their farming, Paris in wine grapes and with, uh, in the old kind of classic farming family and work a card and then play hard but mostly work hard. And, um, you know, my dad went to Uc Davis, did that whole thing and so kind of was really instilled in early life about really caring about food and produce where things come from. And also seeing really early on how,

Speaker 3:          02:23          how there are a lot of people out there doing amazing work in food and they're very rarely recognized or even less rewarded for that. And so that was kind of always on my mind in this back back burner, um, which we, I guess we can circle back to. But uh, it definitely instilled to me these kind of core values that, that there's something, there's something out there that exists for, for, for doing great work in food and that there was an opportunity there. But um, that more was a revelation I had later. What kind of really kicked me into just getting into coffee is the cliche reason most people get into coffee, which is you go to college, you go to coffee shops, you hang out there. Cool. You try to order cool drinks. You usually don't, you know, my, my gateway to coffee was drinking mochas that I hated.

Speaker 3:          03:19          I loved everything about it except for this espresso taste. When I was in high school, I'm trying to go play, I used to play jazz and going and playing like jazz combos and going to coffee shops and just sort of being enamored with this coffee house vibe, this coffee house culture. Then you go to college and then you end up studying there and hang out there. And you find the cool wine and you go to the one that's cool and not the other ones because it's not cool. And just kind of always in the back of my mind thought Cliche Lee, you know, coffee's cool and wouldn't it be cool someday to do something in coffee? Didn't more in the back back of the mind. I went and did other things and studied environmental science and I did Gis and did that for like five years and did a lot of computer stuff and then wanted to really kind of do something on my own. Which I guess maybe kind of coming back to that basis of growing up on a family farm, when you're in a family that farms you don't like clock in for work, you just, it just is life. So I always just sort of thought I'd work for myself. And then after five years of not doing that, I kind of did. I was like a contractor, but uh, I really wanted to just start my own

Speaker 3:          04:33          business. And so this was while you were in school? In College? This was right after I finished college by still the Din the college kind of in a college town, um, up north Chico. And, uh, we're, I ended up living and going to school and other things and um, we can get back to those other things. Yeah, that was cool. Learned a lot about myself and um, yeah. Uh, no, it was great though. I, it is, it was perfect. It was a path I was supposed to be on and but yeah, getting into wanting to start my own business and ultimately taking that, that leap. But when, when I thought like, well, what do I, what is the business I want to do? I kind of came back to this thought that had always been incubating in the back of my mind that, well, coffee's cool. Coffee shops are cool.

Speaker 4:          05:26          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          05:27          I loved, I loved music and I just love this. What I thought at that time was how did very direct tie to coffee houses. I collect vinyl, played in bands, only played analog instruments and somehow coffee fit in the same strata

Speaker 3:          05:43          as those, those elements in my life. And so with out of time without any experience. But I went to talk to the guy and the cool town in the cool coffee shop in town to ask him, would you mind kind of what does it take to do this? How do I be great? What does great look like? Which is an important lesson I've kind of tried to always carry with me moving forward. But, and he said, actually, I'm thinking about selling this coffee house. Are you interested in buying it? One thing led to another and three months later I was standing in the coffee shop that I owned with not exactly understand what to do, understaffed, um, and really had to just feel the weight of it, all of what it's like to take that risk of that commitment and just say, screw it. Like, let's do this.

Speaker 2:          06:32          So do you feel like it was a, it was an out of comfort zone type thing where you're like, I'm in a coffee shop and some of these presenting this to me and I hadn't planned on it, but now you're, this opportunity is, was it an easy decision for you to just say, Yep, I'm going to do it or no. How did you feel going into that?

Speaker 3:          06:51          I don't know if it was an easy decision, but I kind of have a point of view on certain, on these things, which is that,

Speaker 1:          07:03          okay,

Speaker 3:          07:03          decisions are hard. So sometimes it's best just to corner yourself, you know, burn your bridge, whatever you want to say. But I, you know, make the commitment before I, I'm all about analysis. I wasn't analysis and an analyst for five years. So I'm all about analysis and research is my favorite thing to do in life. Probably one of them. But at some point you just jump and you won't ever have all the information. And I do believe, uh, uh, saying that one's Kinda came to me. Um, my sister who was up here was, can bear witness. And the classic plays where you gather all life information to make important decisions, which is after a prince concert at a blackjack table at like two in the morning. Um, but I ended up talking to someone who worked in technology and I guess it built a pretty successful company and we ended up talking for a long time and I had just said, if you could give some piece of advice to a young person who's wanting to really do something special and really get to maybe in a position like you are, and not necessarily like, I don't know if he was wealthy, I'm pretty sure he might've been, but just more I could just tell that he had gotten to some place that he felt very satisfied with and he just, without even blinking, just looked right at me and said, take chances and over extend yourself.

Speaker 1:          08:20          Okay.

Speaker 3:          08:21          And that's sort of in my goto since that night. And in a way it's this permission that some dude at a blackjack table after prince concerts gave me. So of course it's valid and totally trustworthy.

Speaker 2:          08:39          I feel like, um, those little things come into your life. It just different times that reinforce that you are in the right path and doing the right thing. I mean here you are now co founder of a global company, right? Yeah. Yeah. So that's awesome.

Speaker 3:          08:54          Yeah. And I think too, uh, I mean to answer your question, it, the decision what, it wasn't easy, but just feeling like I had this permission to make it and then just jump in, choosing to jump and set of choosing to, let's just wait a little bit more. I'm more of a jumper for better or worse, but I think there is something to that that, you know, in life you have to make a lot of choices. And so I think getting comfortable with making choices are becoming decisive, knowing that you're knowing you're for sure not going to be right. Um, was it the best decision I could've made my life. I'll never know. But it was the one I made and it got me here. It was a stepping stone. So it was definitely a critical decision. Um, which then led me to my next decision, which was to start verve with, uh, my business partner, Ryan. He's over here. Hi Ryan.

Speaker 2:          09:51          He doesn't like being outed, but so you had your store in Chico or you're shopping Chico and what, what was the path then to opening up your own, your own brand?

Speaker 3:          10:06          Well, one year into it, after being super understaffed in you learn a lot when you don't have anyone

Speaker 4:          10:17          you can,

Speaker 3:          10:19          when you know that there no one else's responsibility but yours, there's no like that. There's no boss you just, you look for, right. And you realize, shit, I met and do you just, okay now what do I, what am I going to do? And you met, you have to make calls. Um, a lot of bad decisions, a lot of great decisions, but decisions on the less that move you forward. And I'm learning a lot about having the right people on the bus and learning what it's like to have wrong people on the bus and have to fire people and do all these things was my first kind of year in business. But what came through it besides the business parts and,

Speaker 4:          10:52          okay,

Speaker 3:          10:53          yeah. Sales Tax and all these bookkeeping things that are not my big passion but are super important. If you want to run a business, do not think they're not important. Uh, hire an accountant before you hire anybody else. Um, and uh,

Speaker 4:          11:09          yeah.

Speaker 3:          11:09          Was how much I was falling in love with coffee because when I got into coffee, it wasn't for coffee, it was for a coffee house culture. But after one year into it spending every day doing it, becoming a Barista, just and connecting with a couple of people, friend Shaun wide who now does flat white, he's a ceramicist for a lot of coffee shops around. He was our first employee at Verve, um, a few other people and dropping into the world that became like Barisa culture. Third wave coffee. I was, I became completely enamored with coffee itself and as an analyst and the researcher,

Speaker 4:          11:47          yeah,

Speaker 3:          11:48          this like trapdoor opened and I like fell through it and it was just the universe of just where does coffee come from? Why are some coffees taste different than others? What's happening? And what's up with rusty and different origins, what's up of different varieties. I have to know everything about all of this. And I was thinking about how do I learn, how do I jump in cause I just had this coffee shop and I thought about my friend from college who I played music with who had been in coffee it's whole life and was a home roaster and was the biggest coffee guy knew. And Ryan Donovan, my business partner and we started, I called him one day just from a park bench in front of a farmer's market and said, dude, we should start a coffee roasting company together. He had just moved back from Portland, uh, work in coffee shops, coffee shops, coffee roasters, wholesale, everything.

Speaker 3:          12:32          And long story short, we just met up a few days later, started looking for spots and within a couple of months we signed a lease and started verve in Santa Cruz. Yes, in Santa Cruz. We almost, we originally gonna open in San Francisco and at this time to 2005, we opened the only third wave coffee company in all of California was ritual. I'm Valencia it all Cali, they carried stump town and that was it for the whole state. So at this point in time, if you opened a cool company anywhere, people everywhere, I knew about it. Uh, we were gonna open in San Francisco then almost open in like Berkeley, Berkeley, Oakland at the last minute, right before we were supposed to sign the lease, I got a call from Ryan. He just said, dude, I'm living in Santa Cruz because I got my lady, we're probably to get married some day, which he did. And they have two awesome kids, uh, and said, this is the lifestyle I want to have. I want to able to surf on it, all the ride mountain bikes. I want to build a company where I want to be. And so it kind of fell apart for like a week or so. And then I kind of thought, well, let's just go look at Santa Cruz. And one thing led to another and we ended up making the commitment there and said, well, let's see if we can make noise even though we're here, which we didn't think we'd be able to to do. But you know, fortunately we were able to do that.

Speaker 2:          14:01          That's awesome. Um, so basically it goes to the idea of work life balance and choosing a location that can adapt to the things that you want to do in life where you can pursue this, this passion that you have, a dream that you have that you want to achieve, but also to be able to maintain. Like, I want to go surfing, I want to go mountain biking or whatnot. So can you talk a little bit more about that and how you're able to achieve that?

Speaker 3:          14:32          It's pretty cool to rent survey question, right? It was definitely in the ethos of starting a company, like as I described, but I think fast forward into present day or just,

Speaker 3:          14:45          it's hard, you know? I mean it requires you to saying that you want to do that. And then, I mean work life balance, you know, I've heard like in a work life harmony, you know, um, Bezos talks about that and I think it's interesting to think about it because it, it, it really determine, it's really dependent on the individual where they're at in their life, their age, what they want, what's, and what's energizing them to determine is that a light switch, is it a Yin and Yang? And they have to be opposites and that's how they are distinct but also fuel each other. How you, or is it a fader or is it like I think of the harmony is like multiple things at once, but it's like c major or maybe it's like d minor depending on how your mood. I Love d minor. Um, and uh,

Speaker 5:          15:39          but

Speaker 3:          15:41          it takes, I think it takes practice and again, it just, it's different for different people. I mean, for sure.

Speaker 3:          15:55          You know, one thing for sure as an exercise is just, again, like I like corner myself. So is to force yourself into doing something where you for sure can only be thinking about that one thing. So whether that's, a lot of people have sports, you know, like surfing or mountain biking, get into your like flow state, which I know can happen on computers and a lot of different ways I've experienced. But if you take it into like outside of work and you can pick up an activity or an exercise, there's some thing or yoga float tanks, I don't know, whatever it is for people. I like all that. But uh, that you just have to be in that moment because it requires all of your attention and that's like one way to break whether it's you take always have two days off in a row or every year you take off for a few weeks ago do something or you know, so there's a lot of different ways to do that, but I like trying to figure out, find activities that

Speaker 2:          16:50          requiring all your attention. That definitely makes sense. I think that just in general, the culture here is, or not here as in Google, but here as in the US is that it's very work focused and to be on the clock all the time and to make sure you're doing everything all the time. But there's something to be said about breaking that up and doing the things that you love, making work, even something that you love and making sure you're in the right headspace. And um, I admire the fact that you're able to go to, to so many different activities and focus on them. And the drive that you have is really amazing. So I'm just going to call that out.

Speaker 3:          17:31          I mean, I think you were saying about enjoying what you do. To me, that's a big part of it. I mean, that's why I started my own company, but I just, I, I used to do all of our orientations for like six years. Every single employee that ever worked at Verve, I did every employee's orientation. I used to just tell people like, we want people that want be here and if like you don't want it to be here, I want you to to quit,

Speaker 3:          17:55          which is hard and, and not meaning. Like, cause we're so cool and like you don't belong, but no, just like I don't, I will help you find that, you know, put in notice whatever. I'll help you find a different job, but you owe it to yourself to do something you're passionate about. Uh, whether it's starting your own business or, or not because people are different, energized in different ways or being part of the, a team that has a huge lever for change like Google, um, or how you get empowered in your own way. Um, but I don't, I do the one thing that kind of the work life balance when I feel like it's this dichotomy that I don't like is the feeling that you would just do something that you, that it could mean you put up with something that you don't love to do or even like to do, but you only have to do it eight hours a day. And then you get to live your life, which is cool. I mean there's like a lot of the best musicians I've known the world that day, jobs that more or whatever. But I do, I, I do think it is important to just find what you're passionate about or fine, how to be passionate in what you do because it just makes everything better. And to me a little bit of, that's like the harmony part, which is that you know that your work should be part of what fulfills you. Right.

Speaker 2:          19:10          And I think that that shows in your shops as well. Um, I've been to a few of them and the staff is very friendly. They all do their job really well and they seem to actually enjoy being there. So maybe you can talk about how you incorporate that into your, into your company culture.

Speaker 3:          19:32          Yeah, I'm telling them that they can quit if they don't really want it. I want to tell people they have to quit if they don't want to be here. But um, because I think that's what people should do but uh, for themselves. But it is something that's probably been the most difficult thing as we've scaled. Um, because as you, when you have one shop or the small team, right, I forget the number of people talk about is like a for a small tribe, 10 1530 people. But once you blow it, once you exceed that, there's a lot that happens is innately, especially when you have the small group leaders are present, this trickle down effect. It just, it's is very obvious to everyone that it's easier to set expectations without having things so explicitly written. But as you scale, you know, 40 50, 80 102 hundred employees we have at verve now, oh Nah man, please Google House.

Speaker 3:          20:29          But I'm sure it's more than 200. That's probably about 200 and this room. And uh, but it's the hardest thing to do is to scale culture because at a certain point you have to like literally be thinking, how am I engineering culture now? And it feels there's a, a falseness that's a word that comes with that idea that your engineering culture. But I kind of became a numbered with that a little bit because what you're just trying to, it's, it's a point of being self reflective about being reflective and self aware as a brand and as a company about and to figure out how you want to communicate that and to build that into the culture at, to set those expectations and then ultimately have, you know, the right people on the bus. I mean, I'm a big fan of, I know maybe it's like old school now, but like, you know, good to great Jim Collins getting the right people on the bus.

Speaker 3:          21:28          There's no substitute for that. You cannot, you cannot train somebody and to get in it like you have to just get the right people and then figure out how to empower them. And that's what we're, that's what we've done at verve. And that's what I think we're really focused on this this next year and beyond, is to really figure out how to build a framework so that people really feel empowered and can sort of channel their own entrepreneurial spirit and what they do. And that, that's a little bit of, I think what, what you experience when you come in diversion, you have people smile and greet at you. We'd been criticized for being too friendly. Whoops. You know, cause some people think it's fake, but I don't ever want that. I didn't want there to ever be a fake vibe at verve. It's, it's not that we don't tell people like, and then make sure you put on your smile and get your flavor badges and like, it's not about that. It's like we tell people just be normal. Like, just be real. If you're not someone who would say smaller, say hey, how's it going to someone who like walks in and stands in front of you, then like, okay, that's like, that's your world, but maybe this isn't, you know, for, it's not the right culture for you. So we're just, we just try to find friendly, outgoing people that wanted, like take care of you and tell them to just be normal.

Speaker 2:          22:40          I'm sorry. I guess leading into that, we can go on the flip side of that to your relationship with your vendors, the people who provide, um, the coffee grounds. You want to talk about that a little bit?

Speaker 3:          22:51          Sure. The grounds, the grounds, I'm sorry, the beans. I'm just kidding. People see our restaurant sometimes and uh, and um, see Brian Santa Cruz where we have our restaurant, it's all, we've always created this like whole fishbowl effect with our rescue. We, it's very transparent where what we do and you can come see it and they always see these big round drums, slit cylinders rather. And they say, Oh, is that, is that where you grind the beans? But there's a giant grinders, but there are coffee roasters. But anyway, I'm just kidding. That's good. Call me out. Um, yeah. Uh, yeah, for sure. I mean, we call it, uh, like our sourcing program at verve farm level, we call it a is does go full circle for me personally, back to grind up on a farm and with a parent who was with parents. But My, you know, my dad, we're going, my mom growing up on a farm myself and then my dad also grew up a farm and going to UC Davis, it was really instilled and being like really take care of business people that never did shortcuts and just kept, you know, the orchards and vineyards, meticulous all year round.

Speaker 3:          24:02          Never had garbage on the ground. Everything's just perfect. And the fruit you would show that, you know, my, they grew some of the best, uh, somebody on blank and Paris anywhere in,

Speaker 4:          24:14          in the world and,

Speaker 3:          24:17          but they never really got pretty premiums for it. They're just treated as a commodity and it's like kids on laptops, spine. What's this? How much is the price? How much is it over here? 4 cents cheaper. Pound over here, buy it here, send it to the grocer with no sense of light. But what's the difference in quality? Who are these people? What's their background? Is there any value? Add weekend, you know, like the, just, it's just, just a commodity and coffee, uh, being one of the more traded commodities in the world. I mean for prospective, how much coffees out there Starbucks by, it's like 2.2 and a half percent of the world's coffee. So there's the other 97 and a half percent of the world's coffee that's not being sold by Starbucks. That's how big the market is. It's a commodity market. And so while we got into verve and wanting to figure out how we could do something different, and the tipping point of what became kind of third wave coffee was to go find the best coffees in the world and that there was this, this new new world happening of discovery and, and just extraordinary flavors coming into the world of coffee and we sought to go find them.

Speaker 3:          25:26          So when we started for the first,

Speaker 3:          25:32          I'm not sure if for six, seven years or so, I was, I was our only coffee buyer. So I traveled like four months out of the year all around the globe, Central America, South Africa, South America, east Africa for like four months out of the year traveling to go find coffees. Meat Producers. Go back and see those producers again, discover new gyms out, position people on coffees and to really help find them, but also to help be part of what is maybe the point of the spear of, uh, enormous global industry. But to just help say we're willing to pay you equitably for this work you do, which produces an extraordinary Lee high quality product, that same product that we're then going to take and sell at a higher premium than we maybe some people sell. Definitely compared to what most people sell. Uh, because there's a value that it's worth it and we think

Speaker 4:          26:31          that

Speaker 3:          26:34          it gets some off the rails here. But I was just like this fully steered away from it how being nice to producers. But um, which we are, but no, but to me I can, the economic lever is like the most important lever. If you want to help a farmer pay them more, you can go ask every single one of our farmers and say, what do you really need? And they're just going to say, just pay me more. They're like, a lot of people think like farmers. It's like a pity thing and all this and I don't, I hate that marketing. I hate that kind of cause marketing for coffee for producers because growing up on a farm like my grandpa, so bad ass, my dad hard as nails. Like those are not, those are the last people on earth that want your pity or like farmers, they just want to be treated fairly and to feel like their hard work is like worth it.

Speaker 3:          27:25          They have enough stress with like mother nature and a lot of other things than to, so we sort of built our business around that and you know, and it really starts with customers paying more for a cup of coffee because there's x amount of dollars in a cup of coffee and then everyone has their margins and I believe in supply chain. I mean you need, you know, someone's drinking the coffee, going back in time, someone's delivering the coffee, roasting the coffee, buying the coffee, importing the coffee, someone export at the coffee, someone shipped it and insured it in between someone milled the coffee for export right before that somebody processed the freshly picked cherries. And then someone grew those cherries. You need all of those steps. I mean people can be vertically integrated or whatever, but those steps don't go away. And everyone, I think it's cool if everyone has a sustainable business, transparent business model.

Speaker 3:          28:16          Uh, like the middlemen concept is that it middlemen to me are more like as a term tied to people that operate within a supply chain that take advantage of it without transparency and exploit people on either side of them. But as far as steps in a supply chain, everybody's critical and we all through those points of the supply chain, we treat all of them with as much respect and honesty and transparency as we can because at one end of that supply, at the other end of the supply chain is the producer and at the end that the other end, the bookmarks are literally coffee drinkers and coffee growers and they're the most disconnected physically and emotionally. You know, like people that are like growing coffee on the hills and Santa Barbara, Honduras totally can't necessarily relate to people that work at Google but, or maybe vice versa. But those are like the two most important parts. Everyone else is facilitating. Yeah. You could say we're curators, we go find this stuff. This is cool, this is hot, this is not, but you need someone to throw it on money at the one end. I needed someone to be willing to produce at the other end. And those two need to kind of have that synergy between the two. So we work really hard in our whole business to create that bridge and sort of foster that economy. So yeah, I was really curious that decision

Speaker 6:          29:41          to be in Santa Cruz and not one of the obvious places that you were probably thinking about being, um, a lot of us here in marketing or touch marketing and I would think, you know, you have to go where the businesses are, where the people would be. Um, how was marketing for you and getting your name out and getting going when maybe you're thinking about just, you know, surfer surfer is walking in for coffee. It's not necessarily someone that's gonna I dunno, like a business person in the valley.

Speaker 3:          30:10          Yes. Being aware that people are, could have, I mean, if we had opened in San Francisco 10 years ago, maybe we'd be even in a different type of company, uh, as far as timing and everything. But for me, although we were based in Santa Cruz for like are for like some personnel reasons, Ryan and I, our goal was never to be the best coffee in Santa Cruz. Our goal is to be the best coffee in the world and to create the best coffee company in the world. We just didn't know if anyone was ever going to even get it or care, but we were, that was our path was like, I want our coffee to be, you know, our influences were my, you know, my friends out of Oslo, Norway, and you know, just like what's happening in Australia and Melbourne. Like we were really wanting to step up to that stage.

Speaker 3:          30:56          And I think it's because of that. Uh, and, and the timing of when we, when we opened, uh, as early super early adopters, uh, that's kind of how it all, how it all came together. And then once we had those little opportunities, we had product that stepped up to it. I mean, one of our first places, our brand ever went from Santa Cruz like two months in, was straight to the heart of Manhattan with a cafe grumpy out there, who at the time was the east coast caught ritual. Ah, there's a lot more on these coast now. But they were very early and someone came to Santa Cruz and had our coffee. That was amazing. Brought a bag of her Ethiopia Conga and brought it back to them. And I remember I was working bar and I had to duck down behind the counter and I got a call from the manager cafe grumpy.

Speaker 3:          31:40          They said, we want to feature you on bar here in Manhattan. And then that's how all of our strength in the New York Times heard about us. And then he wrote about it. It just, so it was based on quality, but um, and I think the idea that we were trying to think big, but even just because that's what we wanted out of the company personally. Um, and then that ended up working. So I guess kind of like secret in it a little bit. And, and, and, and as the brand, the brand's super important, like straight up like design brand that always matters to us how we want to design our stores, customer experience, how we want to look, feed what we think of the brand. We've always really been into brand and design as well. So we always thought of that.

Speaker 6:          32:27          That's kind of a two part question, but you mentioned that when you were initially picking your first location, uh, third wave coffee hadn't really taken off yet. Right. Um, and obviously in the last 10, uh, there's been an explosion of that, especially in the bay area from the equator, four barrel, et Cetera. Um, the, the first question is, uh, amongst the other third wave players, are there any that you really admire and why? Um, and the second piece of that is how do you see, uh, how do you see verve in relation to some of the other players in this space? What, from, from your perspective, really sets verve apart from

Speaker 3:          33:06          in the pack? Sure. Yeah, I mean, well it's kind of split into two groups really because a lot of the people that were our biggest, a couple of people that were big influences on us when we were opening Stumptown, Intelligentsia Ryan, my business partner, his brother worked at the blue bottle kiosk on Linden street when that was all they had. So we go back in that world. Those were all influences on us. And as you know, there's been a lot of business activity with a lot of brands including those three brands. So now that they're kind of off the table in that regard

Speaker 5:          33:38          in uh,

Speaker 3:          33:41          you know, with the MNA stuff that's happened, looking to the other side of things, what other brands are out there that now influence us or that I think are influential? I mean there's,

Speaker 3:          33:53          there's a lot, I mean I see stuff all the time on Instagram and new people brands fall on us or something. I'm like, who's this? I check it out. I'm like, damn, that's a killer logo. That brand package, that packaging is cool. I like how they did this. I see like cold beverage drinks being made and serving where and I'm like, that's hot. I just see it's kind of things happening all the time here and there and you know, um, but like the, the major brands that had, you know, it had a lot influence on us early just because you look up to see like, well, who's doing it and who else is doing it? And those were the ones we looked up to. So now we're kind of like on our own trajectory and how we feel different. I mean,

Speaker 3:          34:29          we, I feel like we've always had service first. Uh, especially like 10 years ago and that was super not cool. And the cliches of like, you know, you know, waxed a waxed mustaches and like, you know, suspenders and all this stuff. Um, and Rockstar Baristas, we were like super anti that. In fact, that's actually one of the main reasons we never opened in San Francisco is that we just didn't, there was like an energy that was happening, very young, young, tense energy and we were just not, we didn't want to really get pulled into that world. We wanted to just kind of do our own thing.

Speaker 5:          35:09          And

Speaker 3:          35:11          so I guess maybe that's another way. We've always just done our own thing and worried about what we're up to. I totally influenced and love seeing what everyone's doing. I'm super into like all everything that happens, but at the end of the day of verb, we just go to RM. We kinda just go our own path and be really nice to people, really focus on our retail environments. Being more residential than commercial, have wholesale program that can step up and really service like this level of business but still be like down to Earth are, you know, we're putting a liar and Shannon to our online stuff right now. And then we have some RTD and some other, some cool single start of stuff that we're working on for like new innovative, like next step stuff with our company.

Speaker 7:          35:53          I drink coffee, uh, occasionally. Um, don't really think about what's in my cup too much. Um, maybe everybody here knows what it is, but I don't really know much about like third wave coffee and like what that movement means. And like was there a first wave, a second wave? Is there like a fourth one? Like it went and I got an ninth, six then third. Okay. Um, so I was just kind of wondering, maybe you could provide some more context on that and also maybe talk about where you got your name from.

Speaker 3:          36:20          Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, those are great questions because uh, yeah, I mean the idea of first wave, second wave, third wave, um, loosely is like first wave is like our grandparents coffee institutional canned coffee, Folgers, you ban Maxwell House, sort of that post war era coffee, which was really where coffee, you got big in the u s and really started the real commercialization and commoditization of coffee second wave. So that ran for like 30 years or so. Then second wave comes about with basically is Starbucks revolution, Howard Schultz creating co going from just like coffee as this thing that you take two scoops, put it in here mixed with water and you have coffee or it's like 25 cent diner coffee and nickel diner coffee into now you step into espresso culture, espresso drinks basically espresso culture for starters that that came, that Howard brought from Europe, um, after visiting there and the idea of like $4 coffee, you know that kind of concept of espresso culture, $4 coffee and coffee houses as like he's coined the term third place, you know, your work home and this other place whether it's coffee shopper or not, but just this idea that coffee isn't just the senior grandpa drinks in the morning before going out and like bailing hay.

Speaker 3:          37:39          It's like, cool, I'm going to like my mom does it and like meet your friends there. So that second wave and then third wave came as like just this next generation said grew up, everyone grows up on the previous generation. Grew up on Starbucks, not me personally, but just because I grew up in this super small towns and have Starbucks still doesn't. Um, but, uh, that what's next and, and I, and that there was, people started finding these little lots of coffee that tasted difference. The auction systems that in the coffee world, in the niche inside world started for like the best of Panama auctions, these couple of excellence auctions where they started rewarding farmers based on Cup quality blind and having auctions for their coffee. Um, there was a book written called God and a cup, uh, that really was a turning point to put third wave on the map and this and the gay, you know, and, um, the Geisha variety of coffee that has been sort of synonymous with the highest quality, although you know that that symbol is, is, is definitely it's game plan in a lot of places that maybe that coffee shouldn't grow, but where it still grows the best la places where we get that coffee, it's still one of the best coffees in the world.

Speaker 3:          38:58          So those are kind of like those three, three phases. So yeah. Yeah. GRANDPA's coffee, Starbucks revolution. And then for lack of a better term, the hipster coffee world that we all think of Ms Coffee. Those are like the, although I'm sure like in 1975 if you were like 20 and you got coffee, you thought you were, you were, you were a hipster getting coffee at the hipster coffee shop bridges. So those are the three areas. And then, um, everyone, a lot people ask what's fourth wave? You know, I'm not, people are ready to jump to fourth way right now. And I've heard like fourth wave is cold brew, fourth wave is this, fourth wave is convenience. Fourth wave is bringing food into your cafes. Like we brought like a lot of, uh, more Melbourne since sort of concepts into our store. Avocado since like that. Um, I don't know.

Speaker 3:          39:43          I think to me that's still an extrapolation of third wave. Fourth wave probably shouldn't really come for like another 10 or 15 years per the, unless we're kind of on a geometric sort of growth plan hair. But, um, yeah. So, and then if we're on our name, verve, it's, it originally came because it's, it's a record label of verve records, verve jet. It's a jazz label. And we were just trying to think of names. We had a million names and Ryan, cause we both play music and jazz said what about verve? And it Kinda just stuck and we looked it up and was available and kind of sat with it for awhile and we ended up calling ourselves that. So, but it means the spirit and enthusiasm surrounding the creation of art. And so once we saw the definition, I was like, damn, that really feels right. Like it's like passion energy. Like if you have a lot of verve, you maybe that's the energy you feel when you come into a river of cafe people behind the bar. It's like trying to just be posy.

Speaker 6:          40:49          Oh, I was gonna also ask you how you get your name. Um, so that was an easy one. So I'm going to totally pivot and ask you a tough one. Um, thanks for coming. By the way, I'm just thinking about like coffee has this like very specific kind of climate that it grows in and you see it, you know, and that quick tutorial regions. And I think anecdotally it seems like a lot of those regions are also areas of high conflict. And you look at Central America or Yemen, parts of Africa, like what's our role in all of that? And we're so, so separated from the growers, um, just because of the nature of how coffee grows and where we are physically. Um, do you have a role in that? Like for good or for bad? Do you have a point

Speaker 3:          41:34          of view on like how our collective hunger for coffee is hopefully making lives better and, yeah, that's a good question. I don't work for the CIA and I just watched, I'm totally up to speed on narcos. So, um, so yeah, I can answer this question. Um, it's, you're, I mean you're right, it's, it's crazy. I mean like all Latin America, I mentioned narcos cause that's, I mean you hear about this when you travel to all these countries, you hear about the history of a lot things that back in the day felt like conspiratorial and then you're like, oh yeah. But then everyone, you just hear it firsthand. Um, you know, that's like another talk probably. But, uh,

Speaker 5:          42:22          mmm.

Speaker 3:          42:23          With just US involvement, obviously I'm not a Latin American studies, but I'm sure there's people that could school me all up on that. But it's, you know, it's, it's, it's tough. Um, I mean there are certain places that we don't buy coffee from because it's so complicated. But I wanted to travel there. Like, I can't go to Yemen right now, but, um, uh, I mean I've been to Rwanda and Burundi and I've been in Kenya, like in part in parts of Ethiopia and all places in Colombia. It gets, it can get really real down there in southern Columbia, but

Speaker 5:          43:01          MMM.

Speaker 3:          43:02          And they, certain places I can in Columbia, I can't go and either overnight or I can't, you can't even really go during the daytime. But we go to a lot of out there places in Colombia. But to answer your question, I see coffee as a lever for change and I see that lever really saying the word quality on it. And that's the lever, the coffee lever that we moved. And to me I just really believe that not like what we do is so important. Like for like we're, I mean we're just a small sliver, but all we can do is what we can do. And we want to do it clearly and loudly. And that is to just say that that's probably recently we traveled to go meet producers is to understand who they are and to understand what, how, what, how our approach can help them. Again, not out of charity. Farmers don't want your charity, they just want to be treated fairly. But A, we go. So I,

Speaker 5:          44:00          yeah,

Speaker 3:          44:01          I think one of the best things you can do is just help help create, you know, for any farming families help create a stable economy and something that they can count on. And some end if there. And if the, if you find producers that have a good address, their farms in a good spot and they're willing to put in this extra work because they're passionate about it, you see it all the time. The best farmers are the most passionate ones. There's ones that get lucky but not really. You need, you do need to have a good site this side of the hill, this elevation, the separate macroclimate this aspect of the soil, this, but really it comes down to the farmers passion and hard work and I do feel like what we do in that way is good because it opens up opportunities for people to make more, have more opportunities and more decision making authority and, and how they, how they live. But it's super complex. I mean East Africa, Yemen come on, I mean like Kenya even and then all of Latin America is mostly, it's, it's, it really simmer down a lot. But then with aisle the aisle, everything happened with the cartel and stuff like that. It's, you know, it's its own thing, but we try to steer clear of it and just started, do what we can to empower farmers.

Speaker 2:          45:13          I wonder about this notion of paying for quality and a lot of the talk about like the progression of a coffee and how it's viewed. Um, is there anything else or like any other industries or within the food space even where you see an opportunity for that transition to happen where people have expectations of, you know, paying very little for something where you can see kind of bringing like you either higher quality options or um, higher quality brands with also that higher price tag.

Speaker 3:          45:47          It's, I mean it's probably an everything to be honest with you. I mean part of it is what industries globally are available for that and part of it is how we nationally think about food. So I can remember the statistic off hand. I've like, I've said it before, but I'm like the percentage of Americans spend on food is like really low in the developing world. It's like, don't hold me to this, but it's something like a quarter, like a lot of people on like France or Italy spend on food. It's a part of it is just a descent d a d sense, a decent Tizen density to say, you know what I'm saying? We are desensitized on the price of food because of a lot of reasons including like subsidies and corn and things like that. And we see that as the value add is cheaper is better and bigger is better.

Speaker 3:          46:37          Not this room necessarily, but that's just this thing that's been kind of drilled be cut for good reasons because that's like how people think about food security is one of the best ways to like, you know, growing nation. But so I think you could look at almost anything and think, well what, what, what is the version of this that helps create change in what, who is in the supply chain that wants to do better and who's already wants to produce something better and how do we help them have a voice? I mean you could, I mean like parallel problems ti ti does really, I mean t t has done really amazing. I mean really, really amazing tea growers in China and Japan can get paid really great prices for their tea. I mean you can pick any commodity and dissect it and try to find out how we could leverage the people that want to do quality because I, I I want, and I believe it's us helping producers, but I also think there's just a huge audience.

Speaker 3:          47:36          It just wants better stuff. Like there's a huge audience of people that just like I paid 50 50 cents more for blackberries if they always tasted amazing or like strawberries or, I mean you can just pick anything you eat any fruit and say, would you be willing to pay 50 cents more? Because that could be like a 20 30% increase in the price. It can be applied almost anywhere we choose just to be focused in coffee. But I do think about that a lot from, and that there's an audience that wants, there's an audience that wants quality and they want to have this better experience in their life and they're willing to pay for it. And there's people, people that want to produce that, and it's just connecting those two ends of the supply chain because without them, without people producing high quality anything, there's nothing, no product for people to buy. And without people willing to step up and pay premiums for quality experiences, then there's no livelihood or reasonably able to do it. So, and I believe fundamentally both of these students in the spectrum exists in almost everything we touch. It's just a matter of connecting them. So then that's what we tried to do in coffee. Great. Well, thank you so much for coming.
