Speaker 1:          00:06          Right.

Speaker 2:          00:10          Thank you for coming. I'm impressed. Uh, and flattered that you'd come. Number one to hear me. And number two, uh, I mentioned to mark earlier, the world would come to a screeching halt without Google. I'm just pretty convinced of that. We are all so dependent now on Google so it's actually pretty have much of an honor to be here to talk to you. What I want to do is talk to you a little bit about the work we're doing at the university and we have a research center there. And I want to share with you some of what I think is important for organizations, for leaders and maybe for parents and friends and colleagues even that is a, I want to talk to you about the power of and the importance of positive leadership, positive practices, positive dynamics for individuals and for organizations. So, um, I want to have you think about align across this slide as representing a deviant continuum now in English that we're, deviants has a negative connotation.

Speaker 2:          01:18          So normally deviance means you're in trouble, you're doing something wrong. If I call you a deviant, normally a criticism, but deviants just means an aberration from the norm. Unexpected, not normal behavior show. There's several implications of thinking of deviants on a continuum, so you can think of negative deviance, but you can also think of positive deviance. Several implications, one of which is all organizations exist to eliminate deviance. The reason we organize just to eliminate unexpected abberant not normal behavior. So mark stands up, everybody stops talking, everybody looks forward. We organize, otherwise it's chaos. We can't get anything done. Show all organizations aspire by definition toward the middle of that continuum. That is, we don't want deviance, unexpected aberrant behavior. So for the most part, organizations or organizing puts us in the middle. Another important implication is we know a lot more about one end of this continuum than the other.

Speaker 2:          02:26          So for example, think of physical health. On the lefthand side, we'd call that illness. I got the flu, I got diabetes, I got a heart disease. 90% of all medical research focuses on the gap between the left hand side in the middle. It's right and five six, five meal. If I'm having difficulty, I will get studied. There will be pharmaceutical products produced for me. People will do all kinds of tests as soon as I'm healthy. I mean I get a physical exam once in a while, but for the most part, medical science doesn't pay much attention me. So we know a lot more about the lefthand side than the right hand side. Another important implication, excuse me, is that hardly any research is done in psychology on anything except the lefthand side of that continuum. So for example, physical, uh, physical health gets a lot of attention, but psychological health gets a lot of attention to, for the most part, psychologists are in a business.

Speaker 2:          03:30          95% of publications focus on schizophrenia. Stress, depression, anxiety. I'm not doing so well. Emotional difficulties. That's where we focus. But see on the right hand side of that continuum, there is something called positively deviant health. Physically it's Olympic fitness levels, 5% body fat for man, 15% body fat for women. The ability to run an ironman competition. How many different than me? You know, some research, not much psychologically it's similar. Some years ago there was a book written called flow. It was about, describes a condition where you're so immersed in a task you care about, you lose track of time, you lose track a physiological needs if you're using, if you put electrodes on your brain, you're using more of your brain capacity than normal sounds. Zoning out in front of a screen. It's hyper activity mentally. Not much. Research on that a little bit. Not much. So there is positively deviant phenomena.

Speaker 2:          04:31          We just don't pay much attention to it. Organizationally, it's very similar. If you go to the business school at the University of Michigan, many of the courses, half the courses probably will hand you a case study. The normal assignment is, all right, what are the issues? What are the challenges? What has gone wrong? Come up with some recommendations and defend yourself. I went, how are we going to make money? How are we gonna overcome the competition? And so on that as we go from the left hand side to the middle just fine, but on the right hand side there is positively deviant organization performance. Now there are several important implications of thinking of the right hand side of that continuum. I refer to the right hand side as abundance gaps. I refer to left hand side as deficit gap, problem solving gaps, challenge gaps. Almost everything we study is focused on the left hand side of the continuum.

Speaker 2:          05:23          On the right hand side, I refer to that end of the continuum as a virtuous condition. Now virtuousness as a concept is not really acceptable in scholarly rigorous circumstances to religious, too philosophical, but in the original Latin and Greek virtuousness just means the best of the human condition. The highest aspirations we have for sales is a virtuous state. So when you were at your very best at your peak, that's virtuousness see and music virtuosos are the most or the best, most inspiring performers. Virtuosity. In fact, if the world was virtuous, there would be no war, no poverty, everybody be well educated. It's the best we can imagine. So the whole point of this introduction is to get to this slide that is to separate problem solving deaths, the gaps from abundance scabs. Here's the most important point. When you focus on abundance gaps, you unleash something called the heliotropic effect.

Speaker 2:          06:27          Do you know what the heliotropic effect is? You do. You just don't know you do. You put a plant in the window. Over time, it will lean toward the light. All right, which is an example of the heliotropic effect, which is defined as follows. Every living system, everything alive has a tendency toward the light and away from dark or toward positive energy, away from negative energy. See, in nature, the sun is the source of positive energy is so life giving force, so most accurately defined the heliotropic effect is every living system has a tendency toward that which is life giving and away from that which is life depleting. Now that makes sense, doesn't it? You think of evolutionary processes over time, every species is attracted to that which gives life and is repelled or avoids that which endangers or detracts from life. Now, if that's true, if every human being not to mention every system, every living system, every human being flourishes, and the presence of the positive and languages in the presence of the negative, it has big implications for how we rear our children, what kind of incentive systems we have in organizations, how we treat our colleagues, how we manage the folks who report to us and so on.

Speaker 2:          07:46          So what I want to do is try to prove to you, convince you that the heliotropic effect exists. And then if it does, then we're going to talk about therefore what, what's the relevance to Google, to parents, to colleagues, to friends. So just, um, I, I'm going to share with you a very small percent, maybe one or 2% of the research available. So very little, but a few studies. So here's one study. Let's assume that I am a researcher and you are all students. But let's say you're 10 years old. Just a normal, every do group of students. I have three teachers who are naive to the experiment. They don't know this an experiment, but it is. So I say to teacher number one, look, we have a group of students in this class are incredibly bright Iq points off the church. They are really aggressive students.

Speaker 2:          08:40          It's going to take a great teacher to help these kids flourish. Can you do it? You Bet. Teacher number two of group of students in this class who I've enormous diversity of ability levels, some really smart, similarly challenged lots in, it's going to take a great teacher to handle real variety of ability levels. Can you do it? Sure. Teacher number three of a group of students in this class who come from difficult backgrounds, failed a lot, struggled, have not done well. It's going to take a great teacher to help these kids flourish. Can you do it? Sure. Then I simply asked the teachers to teach for one year. Now the students are all the same. I simply asked the teachers to teach for one year, same subject. At the end of the year, I give all the students a standardized test and I find statistically significant differences in the results.

Speaker 2:          09:29          Who scores the best above average scores? Average scores below average scores of, I think I'm teaching geniuses. I am. I've learned from US army generals with whom I spend several days a year, 60% of the outcome of navy seals training, army ranger training, special forces training is due to the expectation of the instructor. It's called the Pygmalion effect happens with airline pilots all the way through preschoolers learning shapes and colors. All right, that's one study. Another study done here on our campus has been replicated several times, so a physician puts a drop of liquid at the bottom of your nostril in which there's cold virus, they call it rhino virus. You breathe in the virus, some people get sick and some people don't and the question is will how do you explain who succumbs to the virus and gets a call versus not? Turns out the temperature at the back of your throat where you were sofic is neat, meets your nasal passages a half a degree difference in air temperature causes you to succumb or the virus versus be resilient and your emotional state affects the temperature.

Speaker 2:          10:32          Happy, optimistic, positive people become six significantly less often half as often as depressed, angry, cynical people. But the classic study that illustrates this is called the nun study. It's a study of 678 Catholic nuns living in a convent. Now, this was originally designed as an Alzheimer's disease study, so these women were between the ages of 75 and 104 and some of them and Alzheimer's disease, but see they have the same diet, same regimen, same environment. You can control for a lot of factors. Well, there was a side finding that emerged from that research and here it is. I was especially interesting to me they found the journals or diaries of 180 of these women when they entered the convent 60 years before. Some of these women are saying things like this in their journal. This is a culmination of my life's dream. I'm so happy to enter the order.

Speaker 2:          11:29          This is such a blessing. Some are saying this is going to be a real challenge, going to be a sacrifice, going to be difficult, but I'm committed. I'm going to follow through difference. They simply put nuns in two groups, depending on which type of type of journal they were keeping. Then the study was at the end of 60 years, they simply counted the number of nuns alive in each group. Now, these numbers aren't precise, but they are very close and they represent the difference of the 90 nuns in the first group. 70 real live of the 90 [inaudible] in the second group, 20 were alive and at every decade. There's a significant difference in mortality rates. 13 years difference as it turns out, I mean, you live longer on that happy, optimistic, positive perspective. Now the study, let's assume that for a minute, I'm interested in having all of you become better bowlers.

Speaker 2:          12:21          B. O w. L. All right, and I'm so committed to this. I'm going to give you a big incentive. In fact, my power, I'll give you $1,000 if you can improve your bowling score by an average of 10 pins. All right? Pretty good incentive. The challenges, I'm going to give you only 30 days, so we got to get a baseline. We're all going to go down and bowl three games. I'm going to film you as you bowl then for you folks. I'm going to show you when you were bullying. I'm going to show you only when you made strikes and spares when you're knocked all the pins down. Okay? I'm going to show you when you were bullying. I'm going to show you only when you did not make strikes and spares, so square up. Work on your approach. Try to improve. All right? 30 days later we come back together. We all go down and bowl. Three more games. Some of you get the money who'd get the money?

Speaker 2:          13:12          These folks who get the money. The question is why? Why would these folks do better? Just by watching themselves make strikes versus these who are trying to improve. That's kind of easy and then getting comfortable. I'm getting confident and stuff except think about this the first time you're not in played basketball. Then she mostly miss. What didn't you learn how to miss? Because most of the data's coming back wrong. First time when the golf course went this way, this way, first time in a tennis court bounced off your racket went over there in the net. Why didn't you learn how to do it wrong? The answer is heliotropic effect. Inherent in your DNA is a tendency to learn the positive. If you didn't, you wouldn't be this old. You would've died before. Now you would not have adapted so you don't have to choose. I'm going to show you in a minute.

Speaker 2:          14:02          You don't have to choose. You have an inherent inclination. It is in your DNA. I showed you a picture of a cell and that last slide, it's at every cell in your body has receptors to light. When it's turned transforms into life giving energy. It's at the cellular DNA level. The heliotropic effect has an n, eh, creates an inclination in all of us toward the positive. I'll show you some more data and just a minute. One more. One more study. I used to do this in my classes. I don't do it anymore, but it's done all over the world. That's assume all of you are in my Mba class at the University of Michigan and I say to you, okay, students in my class, you are required to keep a journal and you have to write in your journal every day, okay? However, you folks every day are going to write in your journal three things for which you're grateful.

Speaker 2:          14:54          All right, so five minutes before you go to bed tonight, just write down the three best things that happened here. Today are three things for which you're grateful. You write down three events or three things that were frustrating or problems you faced, so I got a journal group. I've got a gratitude journal group. All right. Now at the end of the semester, I'm going to do several studies. All of these studies are published. For example, I'm going to give all of you a flu shot. Seven days later. I'm going to test for the number of antibodies in your system. You're going to be healthier in seven days detectable. He physically healthier, more antibodies in your body. Then are you now look, this is a gratitude journal. It's putting yourself in a virtuous or in this case and gratitude condition. Once a day I can get a physical difference.

Speaker 2:          15:42          This is not something difficult. This is not losing weight or giving up coffee or training for a marathon or something. This is put yourself in a virtuous condition. Another, I give you a mental acuity test. What's that? You have to memorize information. You have to remember information. You have to come up with sophisticated decision rules for complex data, more mental acuity here than here. I can affect your test scores. I'm going to show you in a minute. I give you a creativity task. What's that? Well, think of all the things you can use this for or a ping pong ball or a brick. More ideas here and a broader variety of ideas here. It's called mental flexibility here than here. This is a gratitude journal. This is, this is a pretty easy intervention. There's a study done about six months ago now as the first they say claim its own.

Speaker 2:          16:34          Only one of its kind. I can detect if you have, if you have heart disease and the basis of blood chemistry. I'm not a medical doctor, so I don't know how that works. But that's, that's apparently the case. So what they did is took heart disease patients and he simply put them in two groups once a control group. The other one, they asked them to keep gratitude journals for eight weeks every day. At the end of eight weeks, they simply tested blood chemistry. Those people are keeping gratitude. Journals were healthier, their blood chemistry was healthier than those who did not. I mean, they said, holy cow, first study of its kind to show that kind of evidence. And then I've learned from these military folks, if you lose a spouse to death or divorce, zero deep depression, six months later here, 30% deep depression here six months later.

Speaker 2:          17:30          So the whole notion is this virtuous positive practices has physical differences, cognitive differences, academic differences and so on. I'll show you some more. Um, earlier this year, I was on a group of, I had a chance to select the best doctoral dissertation done in the plant on the planet in this general area. This is the winner done by guy who went to Butan and he selected high schools, so he had 11 high schools in an experimental condition, nine high schools in a control condition would that mean in 11 high schools? He changed the curriculum so students were exposed to virtuousness positive practices, positivity and so on. He then measured one year later and then two years later, simply a measure of wellbeing. How you doing? You're feeling good about yourself. Do you like school? You're getting along with your friends and so on. Wellbeing, significant improvement in those, exposed to this positive stuff.

Speaker 2:          18:34          Then here was the real surprise. He then measured scores on standardized tests. Now in America that would be sat, act tests, significant differences. A year later, two years later, academically they perform better. The only differences are getting exposed to positive practices. Then you went to Mexico, approximately 70,000 students in that study. That is 35 high schools in each condition, experimental condition, control condition, significant improvement, wellbeing, academic performance. Then he went to Peru, 700,000 students, 347 schools in each condition. Significant differences, and we can affect your test scores. I mean, virtuousness actually has an impact. And here's, here's why. There are interesting studies done of heart rhythms. So for example, I have a good friend at an organization called heart math. They study heart rhythms in a frustrated, angry, upset, depressed condition. Your heart rhythms are very unpredictable. Go like this. In a positive virtuous state, like for example, inducing gratitude.

Speaker 2:          19:51          Your heart rhythms go like this. You don't have to choose it. It's heliotropic. So now you know why after 60 years, some nuns are alive in some are dead. Their heart just works better. Another study, they simply ask people to contemplate, ponder a positive, optimistic future versus a neutral or negative future. So now I have you in a mental set. Now I'm going to put you through an MRI machine and scan your brain. Turns out those in the positive, optimistic mental set had more areas of your brain activated and have those activated. They're activated to a great extent, greater extent. You literally are smarter in that positive virtuous state. You don't have to choose it. It's heliotropic your brain works better. And that virtuous positive state, sorry I don't have these slides to show you a another study. The, excuse me, the um, there was a study done of a kidney dialysis patients, people who were hooked up to a kidney dialysis machine so they can't go anywhere.

Speaker 2:          21:07          And the question is, um, I'm either, the assignment was we want some of you to receive a phone call from other people expressing love, support and concern. And we doubled that is you're going to receive a phone call for some people and for some people we want you to place a phone call expressing love, support and concern. At the end of that period of time. At the end of a two year period of time, those people who had placed a phone call, those people who had received support and love and concern from other people were significantly better off than those who did not. And here's the, here's the explanation for them. If you are significantly overweight, the probability of dying early is 20% if you are an excessive drinker, probably dying early, 30% my MBA students always want to know what the definition of excessive means.

Speaker 2:          22:04          If you're a smoker, probability of dying early, 50% if you are in poor social relationships, probably of dying early, 70% bad social relationships, Trump, the physical factors we normally pay attention to. I mean it matters a lot and there's a whole bunch of research that suggests that that's the case. If you're in a conflicting, difficult relationship, you're going to have a hard time. That is your body for many reasons is not going to be, it's not going to do well. All right, well the question is why is that? Well, most of the time we say, well it's because um, you know, I'm getting my needs met. I mean, I want to be popular. I, it feels good to have somebody care for me and so on, except that's not, that's not the explanation. Here's the explanation. A and these studies were all done in our, in our university.

Speaker 2:          23:05          So I have a colleague who's a psychologist who, um, took entering freshmen at the interview or University of Michigan. These are all 17, 18, 19 year old kids. She simply asked them to identify their goals for the year. Now everyone has lots of goals, but she categorized the goals into two types. One type recalled achievement goals. I want a good, good grades, want to be popular. I want a girlfriend, I want to make the team and so on. The other kind of goal was called contribution goals. I want to make a difference. I want to have something get better because of what I've contributed. Now she put people into groups depending on which type of goal was dominant. Then the study was you simply followed these students for a approximately a year academic year measuring things like how well they get along with her roommates, how many minor physiological symptoms they experienced, the cold headache, nausea, flew, cramps, stuff like that.

Speaker 2:          24:02          How many times they miss class, what their grade point average was, how many times they made the team or got elected to a club office or something. See social factors, academic factors, physical factors on every single dimension. Contribution, goals, trumped achievement goals in predicting performance. It's what they contributed more than what they got. Second, uh, this is one of my favorite studies is a study of multiple sclerosis patients. These folks, half of them were assigned to place a phone call once a week to somebody. Half of them were asked to receive a phone call from somebody once a week, two years later they measured wellbeing. You can see on the right hand side of this slide, self efficacy, confidence, competence, physical activity, hope, depression. Those who placed the phone call or eight times healthier at the end of two years than those who received the phone call.

Speaker 2:          25:03          It was the contribution because them to flourish physically. Um, you know, um, borders bookstore used to be in Anarbor now bankrupt world's largest book seller. While they were in business, they created the borders foundation. The borders foundation was simply a unit within borders where you could contribute money and if people had a sick child or an accident or needed financial support, you could apply to the borders foundation. Get results are get a financial support. When of our doctoral students did it, did a study, the hypothesis of which was if you have received money from the borders foundation, loyalty, commitment, engagement will go sky high. It turns out no difference if you receive money, if you hadn't received money, didn't matter. What did matter was the opportunity to contribute to the borders foundation. If you had given money to the borders foundation, commitment, loyalty, skyhigh borders is bankrupt.

Speaker 2:          26:02          The Borders Foundation will not die. Still exists. Now they're trying to get mom and pop bookstores around the country to join who don't have safety nets. People will not stop giving if they have a chance to give turns out. Contribution in relationships is the predictor. So when we think about positive leadership, it's not, I want to be famous, I want to get, make sure you give me things. It rather is what can I contribute to the wellbeing or flourishing of other people? And there's a whole bunch of ways to think about doing that because almost all organizations, when you do especially well give you stuff, you given him financial incentive, you get your picture on the wall, gives you some recognition and a newsletter. You, you're a receiver. Turns out if you have an opportunity to give or contribute to somebody else, that's a much better incentive. Like for example, if mark does especially well, I'm going to ask him to coach somebody else because they need to become as good as he is. That is his reward as he get a chance to teach or coach. That's just one example of Manny that you can use to contribute in organizations. Okay, and I'm going to skip these now.

Speaker 2:          27:15          The question is, all right, I got the brainwaves camera and I got the heart rhythms, rhythms and all that stuff. Okay? But wait a minute. Organizations are much more complex than our individuals. That as you can get a bunch of happy people together, does not make for a great organization. So the question is, does this actually work in organizations when I'm held accountable for profitability and productivity and quality and customer satisfaction and so on. That's been my research for 15 years. That's been the question. Yeah, but does it work in organizations? Turns out after 15 years. The bottom line is if you implement in an organization positive practices, we haven't talked about what that is at all, but virtuous practices, compassion, kindness, uh, forgiveness, gratitude and so on, you will get higher levels of profitability. You make more money by far than the industry. Average productivity is significantly improved.

Speaker 2:          28:22          Quality goes up, fewer errors, fewer, fewer, less waste, fewer mistakes, innovation, new product ideas, creativity, all improve the scores on creativity go up, customer satisfaction, customer loyalty, customer retention goes up, employee satisfaction and employee retention. I'll go up. That is, that's what you're held accountable for. All of those are significantly improved when you implement positive practices. I'm going to not show you hardly any of their search, but let me just give you a couple of studies. One of the most surprising studies is this one because we said where is the least likely place anybody would care about this? Positive, virtuous, Saccharin, sweet, soupy, syrupy touchy, feely, naive pollyannish stuff. Likely Wall Street. I mean if I got $100 million invested in that portfolio and I'm going to hedge fund, I want to know if it's going up or down cause I got one goal. Show me the money.

Speaker 2:          29:29          That's all I care about. I don't care if you treat people well. I don't care if you downsize, I don't care if you, I don't care what you do. I want to return. So it picked 40 firms when they implemented positive practice or some did better than others. Should we measured change or in other words, how are you getting better? You're getting worse. You're staying in the shame. When organizations improved, gotten more and more virtuous, essentially we could account for almost 50% 0.45% 45% of their financial performance. Now, I dunno, anything that predicts Wall Street performance by 45% but we could plus a bunch of other things to turn over and you know, satisfaction and all those kinds of things. That is even in the least likely a most hostile environment. You can imagine positive performance has paid off and then in healthcare you'd sort of expect that, but over a two year period of time, double digit improvement where the industry average is one or 2% double digit improvement on these various dimensions that really count that people want to improve.

Speaker 2:          30:36          So the whole point is with only a very small sampling of the information, what we know is actually positive practices pay off physically, cognitively, socially, and they pay off. Organizationally when you implement positive practices, organizations do better. Where we improve what we want, what we're held accountable for, oh, we want to improve. All right, there's a bunch of resources that are available if you want to get them. There's a website that we have for our research center where there's long lists of videos and references and papers and syllabi for courses and all those kinds of things. And that I'm going to stop here because I've just, uh, I've just talked for 32 minutes. Questions, comments, yeah, buts anything on your mind.

Speaker 3:          31:36          Hey, my name is Dominique. Um, and I do have a question about if you've ever stood a study on Google. I feel like all of the brackets you talked about and positive leadership and are quite a few of our pillars. I think our senior leadership takes pretty seriously. Have you ever looked at a study on here? Never

Speaker 2:          31:54          done it. I've never done a study on Google. I'd love to. Just was curious. I read a lot. I would like to get my prediction. I'll finish the thought. My prediction is that there are pockets that are spectacular, extraordinary and pockets that are, could be improved, I would guess. And one of the nice things about starting Google is to try to find out where those are and what the practices are specifically here that would create the spectacular performance. Um, uh, I am so far there is no disconfirming evidence that this pays off and organizations so far I'm not going to disconfirming evidence about anything but not this. Thanks.

Speaker 4:          32:39          First of all, thank you for coming out here and speaking to us. Um, I was wondering if you had a similar to the question about Google, but have you done any research or, but we're on like nonprofits and those who work there, um, or maybe are in some sort of service jobs such as, um, nursing or fire firemen, you know, just helping the community.

Speaker 2:          32:59          Yeah, that's really good question. How about not for profits and turns out we've done a lot of work in the f and the following industries. There's a lot of work in education that is implementing these positive practices, changes, test scores, changes, academic performance and so on. We've done a lot of work in healthcare. I showed you one little quick study of that, uh, of that. And, and hospitals. We've done a lot of work in the national intelligence agencies, CIA, FBI, Nsa, Dia, 16 agencies. See you can't manufacture enough bullets to keep the world safe Kenyon. So they've gotta be some alternatives. They get it. And it's been pretty inspirational to me to see how the FBI is trying to figure out a way to implement positive practices or positive leadership. You know, so that's another military army generals, especially US army generals. I'm not working on any, you know, the noncommissioned officers and so on. But from the one, two, three, four star level, boy, I tell you what their, um, I'm impressed with them from their perspective setting strategy for the world. This resonates and matters. So they've been working on this for seven or eight or nine years, you know, this whole topic. Um, so that we did a big study of nursing nurses, similar kind of outcome with the nursing care and probably some others, but there's a lot of not for profit, um, work that's being done.
