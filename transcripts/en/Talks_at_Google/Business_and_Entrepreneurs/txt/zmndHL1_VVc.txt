Speaker 1:          00:06          Hello everyone. Thank you for having me here. So before I start, just curious, how many of you are working on AI stuff? Okay, raise your hand. Oh, a lot. So today my topic is AI startup ecosystem in the US and China. I will provide some comparative perspectives on the two ecosystems. Okay. So many of you have noticed that AI startups grow rapidly.

Speaker 2:          00:40          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:41          So if you look at Ai Unicorns, Unicorns, meaning startups have over 1 billion valuations, there are 20, 32 Ai Unicorns in by 2018. So this is a report here by CB insights. This is about 10% of the whole Unicorn club and that this percentage is continued growing. Now that there's 17 companies from us, 10 from China. So it looks like us has more AI unit concern China. But if we look at this figure, um, we look at top five most funded Ai Unicorns. Actually China has rate and the most too well founded Ai Unicorns are from China. Maybe you are not familiar with some of the companies. I will provide you a little bit quick background.

Speaker 2:          01:39          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:39          The first well funded company is caught by dams. Actually. They have a big office in Culver city by dance raised three billing. It's a Chinese company. It has a number of products, but the two main products, one is total, which is AI powered new zap. It has over 500 million monthly active users. The second one, which is probably more popular called Tick Tock, they have over 500 million monthly active users globally. This is a AI powered, a short video sharing app. If you haven't use it, please have a try.

Speaker 2:          02:23          Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:24          Now the second well funded Ai Company is called a sense time. The company raised 2.6 billion in folks on computer vision. Now since time has over 700 enterprise customers and the strategic partners globally, it has applications over more than 10 industries. The main technology or product and have since time is facial recognition. There's facial recognition. Service is serving over 400 million people.

Speaker 2:          03:01          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          03:02          so the fifth well found, the company is called a ubi tech. It's another Chinese company. This company is building their service robotics, right? This looks human like robotics are produced by UV tech. There's a lot of robotics, so the revenue in 2018 is actually over 300 million. So the Saudis robots very well and their sales increased over 500 times within four years.

Speaker 2:          03:32          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:33          If we look at the two other companies from the U s they are auto autonomous driving companies, neuro and Argo Ai, they both raised a billing euro is a little bit different. They are building this self driving car for food delivery. Well it can also deliver other stuff later on. Argo AI is more like standard self driving car company. They build in self driving cars. We notice that these five top, most well funded AI companies, they are all funded within a few years and there are so many other unicorns they grow so rapidly. So the question I want to ask is why are these AI startups growing so rapidly? There are a couple of reasons. First, there's continuous progress in data processing, computing power and the algorithms. If we look at this two fingers, this is some statistics on image net dataset. I think many of you should know that. Um, if we look at as the classification accuracy, image net Dataset, the accuracy continuous to improve, right?

Speaker 1:          04:49          In 2014, um, and actually after 2014 it beats humans and now it continuous to improve. Another very interesting observation is that in the past a year or two, the training time and the image net to building this machine learning models actually jobs dramatically right, sounds to all these parallel computing cloud computing. Now the second reason for the rapid growth of AI companies is a significant growth of venture capital into Ai. So this figure shows the global AI investments year by year. We can see that the trend is that VC money is growing year by year into Ai. And in 2008, the VC money total actually is 70% up compared to 2017. Now this curve actually shows the number of deals. So interestingly, in 2018, the number of deals that raised money is actually a fewer than that in 2017 and we are observed a large loans but fewer teachers, fewer deals, meaning fewer companies. Actually raised money.

Speaker 1:          06:15          So why is that? Why given that so much money is into AI but money are concentrated on deals, larger, um, is fewer deals. There are a couple of reasons but the main point is that in some AI fields, the bigger guest speaker, basically big companies, big startups are easier to attract them more money. So there are a couple of reasons. So one is the data network effect because these Ai Unicorns tended to collect more and more data and these data actually provide a company more advances in technology. Secondary, these Ai Unicorns are easier to attract a more AI talents and you know, more I'd talents means right, you have more power in terms of technology development. Suddenly these Ai Unicorns are easier to expand to more territories. Tick talk, as I said, the core product of by dense, they are actually expanded to the US, Asia and Europe. Now they have over 500 million monthly active users globally. The first reason is that these bigger AI startups can expand to more industries easier. Since time as an example, they already covers over 10 industries. No. A natural question to ask is, well, there'll be more capital into AI, probably. Yes. If you look at the US VC market, 2018 is actually a record breaking year. So this shows the total venture capital money raised by US startups in 2018. Right? The amount is significantly larger than 2017 and the years before.

Speaker 2:          08:10          Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:10          So it looks like this is great timing for us AI startups because there's a lot of money in the market. What about China in southern 17 2017 actually, the, the AI funding, the VC money in China exceeds the u s right. The total fund in China is about 48% of the total AI funding globally. Well, you as has only 78, sorry, 38

Speaker 1:          08:44          but things are getting changing. Uh, so if you look at this figure, right, starting from 2018 so the number of deals and also the amount of venture capital money in China is decreasing. So in China, startups and the VC's are facing so called Capitol winter. Why is that? Uh, there's multiple reasons. One reason is the slowing economy of China. And secondary also because of the flooring share price of the tech giants, people are afraid of the market. Uh, there could be some other reasons, but the main point is that in China, the VC market, it's different. It's getting changing. And this may challenge the Chinese are Unicorns. This other reason for the raptor growth of Ai Unicorns is the thriving industry applications nowadays you can see AI, unicorns are solving big problems in almost each industry. You can imagine, uh, I will go to these details later, but these massive application drives the rapid growth of Ai Unicorns.

Speaker 2:          10:00          No.

Speaker 1:          10:01          Let's ask a second important question. Why do some AI companies grow so rapidly in one country but not in the other? We notice like companies like by dance like sense time, they are big in China but not in the u s right in the u s this autonomous driving startups raised a lot of money but now seem in China. So why is that?

Speaker 1:          10:30          So to answer this question, actually we have four key observations. So first for I and D USA is a head of China second that it for manufacturing. China has its own advantages. So delay for B, two B industries us is stronger. So what is B two B B Two B stands for business to business. Meaning the customers are enterprises. Well for B two C and B Two g China is stronger. B Two c stands for business to consumer or the customers or consumers. B Two g g stands for government. Many you are serving government hell for B two C and B Two g China is stronger. The force of the observation is that Chinese unicorns actually I adopting some unique growth strategies. So I will come to this observations one by one. First R and D USA is a huddle ahead of China. Now, if we look at Ai Talents, right? So if we look at that, the talents in or AI companies, u s as about 1.5 x of the talent, the number of talents in China, uh, the difference is not significant, right? But if we look at the number of top AI talent, u s has much more advantage that the top AI talent in the u s is 5.3 times of the number in China, right? All these AI talents are very important. The for int for developing this disruptive technologies.

Speaker 1:          12:19          Another example is two, looking at the autonomous driving technology. This is sort of integrated AI technology because you are building a complex system. This is a figure is very interesting. It's report, it's published by DMV in 2018. It shows a miles per this engagement. What does it mean? It means how many miles can have a self driving car drive until a human gets involved. So we can see that. Uh, the first one is Waymo develop a by Google. Waymo is obvious today, the top one in terms of the test, right? But this is in Tucson, the 18. Uh, for now, Google is absolute leader. Uh, in this chart you s has 16 companies. China has four, looks like us self driving cost companies are much more than China and other countries. Neuro Aurora, I also doing well, right? You notice that the top five companies are from the U s we need, they are ahead of China. Uh, interestingly in euro and Arora I founded by x school goes. So Waymo is a leader in self driving car technology. It has built a large pool of talents way more actually develop the technology 10 years ago. Right? So, uh, and the larger pool of talent developer by Waymo actually helped other self driving costs to boot Dell technologies. So, so Google made a big impact in this space.

Speaker 1:          13:59          No. The second observation is that manufacturing in China has its unique advantages. Why is that? Um, because there's relatively low cost of Labor's and not raw materials. In China, manufacturing infrastructure, uh, mature, uh, highways, roads and paths in China are well developed. So the litters detailed division of tasks. So the pipeline of manufacturing, it's very mature. Examples of the, uh, examples are UV tech, robotics. They can produce this kind of robotics in fairly cheaper price than anywhere else. Show me is another great example. Show me beauty ecosystem of smart devices in relatively cheaper price. So the takeaway for the u s startups

Speaker 2:          14:52          is that you can leverage this manufacturing advantages in China. Uh, good examples are lime and birth, right? They are building this scooters, which you can see a lot in Santa Monica. Uh, actually these scooters are mainly developed in China and these companies can cover the cost just whizzing 20 days. Touring is one example. The company we invested doing security robots, it can patrol indoors and outdoors because the hardware are manufactured in China. It's 80% cheaper than it's us competitors. So companies here, she'll try and to leverage the hardware cost advantage in China.

Speaker 1:          15:40          So the third observation is really important. So in B two B space, US startups are stronger. We're in B two C and B two cheap Chinese startups are stronger.

Speaker 2:          15:53          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          15:54          So we actually calculated the average founding of the top three startup in each industry. Well Ai is applying to, so the first part is the industry is that US startups raise much more capital then those in China. And for the second part, these are industries where Chinese startups raise more money. And if we dig into these two parts, we find that these industries are more B, two B industries where your customers are typically enterprises. Where the second part your customers are more like consumers and also government.

Speaker 2:          16:37          Okay,

Speaker 1:          16:38          so let's explain why is that in the u s B2B ecosystem is well established. That means AI startups can get access to data easier. You see all kinds of Saas model based companies are very well developed in the u s and also AI has a clear values to enterprises because AI can help enterprises to lower the cost to improve the efficiency. That's why in the US a lot of enterprises, I try AI technologist to help them. What about China? China is different. In China, US B2B ecosystem is not well established. The trust, that ecosystem, the trust, the system is not as well as developed in the u s also because of the low cost of human labors, enterprises in China tend to hire more people instead of trying to using AI to lower the cost or improve the efficiency. And also in China, B2c has a higher gross and more data. So startups doing B2C space can access data much easier. And in China you will see that the mobile internet users are growing very fast.

Speaker 2:          18:05          Okay.

Speaker 1:          18:05          The last reason is BTG has a higher revenue and the more data in China. So in China, Chinese government is highly supportive of AI startups. They give a lot of data to start ups like since time. So by working with government, these big Ai Unicorns can access more data and they can also get big contracts from Chinese governments. So this were drives the high gross of these companies.

Speaker 1:          18:38          I want to just talk a little bit about B two c space in China. Well, you can access much more data, right? If you look at this curve in China, there's three times active mobile devices than the u s and the number of food. The delivery orders is much more like 10 times in the u s but this is in 2017 I think today us has more food delivery, right? You see like door dash, Postmates or kind of delivering companies. And also the mobile payments in China is 50 times than the u s so you can get access to these consumer based data fairly easily. And you know, AI is building on data. So this is the key.

Speaker 2:          19:24          Okay,

Speaker 1:          19:25          let me give you some example. One example in B2b industry is a robotics process automation. Well, AI can automating large amount of repetitive works, right? Um, the typical example is Ui pass. This company raised about 500 million. Their revenue grow from a million to a hundred million. We seeing only 21 months. You can see that the USS Enterprise are paying a lot of money for these type of company and it has over 2000 enterprise customers globally.

Speaker 2:          20:05          Okay?

Speaker 1:          20:06          So another B Two B space, uh, is cybersecurity, right? US enterprises paying a lot of money for a cybersecurity companies to using AI to help them to detect and defend these attacks. One company Stripe, uh, crowd strike, they raised over around four, 500 million. They actually analyze a trillion events per week and it prevent, uh, about 30 southern purchase per year. Very significant. Another example is agriculture. Well, the company plenty they can do over like 300 times crop year old than traditional farms and only using 1% of water. So you can see AI plays a significant role here in terms of improving the efficiency.

Speaker 2:          21:06          Okay,

Speaker 1:          21:07          that's, rob has some example. The B two c space where I'll try new startups is stronger in entertainment is one example. You can use AI to do personalization. Using Ai to do intelligent recommendation by dance is a good example. As I mentioned, another industry, uh, service robotics, companies like UV tech, uh, producing this, all kinds of, uh, robotics to solve people to interact with people. Well, AI plays an important role of perceiving the environment and interact with people. A good example of Btg is the physical security space. Well, Chinese government is highly supportive and give big contracts to startups. Uh, let's look at some number in China. 117 million security cameras are deployed and you can expect 400 million more. So there's way more number of security cameras standing us since time is the leader in the space. But you also notice other competitors from China facetime cloud walk R or raised big amount of money. So the B two g space in China, uh, it actually attracts a lot of capital.

Speaker 1:          22:34          I also want to mention that B, two B space in China is booming, although you see that us is stronger in B two B, but now Chinese companies are paying more attention to the space. Why is that? Because the labor costs is increasing because of the aging population. Now, enterprises in China, I pay more attention to cost. Secondly, the far the high growth of Internet mobile, mobile Internet users are, the close rate is diminishing. Now, Chinese companies are looking at the B to B two B space more because you couldn't have such big roles in B, two c anymore, right? For most field. Oh, we're going to say you some example. For example, a you'd be tech, the our buting intelligent inspection robots that can patrol and find safety risks. Since time it's also doing remote sensing. They work on satellite data. They attract the insights of the data. Then can apply to industries like agriculture.

Speaker 2:          23:42          Okay.

Speaker 1:          23:43          Now the takeaway for the u s is that if you are doing something in B two B space, it's huge opportunity to expand that to China market. Well example is database. Visser is a US company backed by sequoia. Uh, they actually serving a lot of customers in the u s but also in China. You can see customers like Alibaba, Jingdong and some other social apps, social apps in China, right? Say they started in the u s but now they expand heavily in China. Another takeaway is that if you are working on B two C or B two g space, actually you can learn a lot from China's practice because Chinese startups have tried really hard in these spaces because B, two B is tougher, right? They try to hard in B, two C and B Two g and they have explored various possibilities in these spaces. That's real. Has some example. Facial recognition. You can see that facial recognition technologies in China have been applied to every industry. You can imagine, right from uh, education, finance, house, Kale, entertainment, all tall security, many industries right here. You can imagine it's way, way more ahead of us.

Speaker 1:          25:15          And that was an interesting example is the license plate recognition, right? You're going to sing you this as an easier computer vision task to recognize the license plate on your car. Now in China, many shopping malls have the systems, this systems where recognize your license plate when you get into the parking structure and then we will get out. It will automatically count how much time you spent and you will pay for it. Uh, no ticket needed, right? And it improves the whole traffic flow significantly. Um, so these systems are probably using China now, but it's still early in the u s so for startups in the US it's good to look at some applications in China. Maybe some of them you can apply to the u s two.

Speaker 1:          26:04          Um, another example is the physical security space. I mentioned this company, we invested, they are doing security robots. They actually learned a lot from the PTG space in China. These security robots will patrol in office spaces during off hours. Um, they would do human detection. They will not do facial recognition, um, because people will have less concern about their privacy, but they will detect humans and see if there's some safety risks. They will also collaborate with the security guards in the u s so that if there's some risk discovered, the robot will collaborate with Scott's to resolve these risks.

Speaker 1:          26:53          Okay. Now the force observation we have is that Chinese Unicorns, I adopt some unique growth strategies. One strategy is the horizontal expansion. Right? In China there are some Unicorns, a pride, a core AI technologies to multiple industries. Since time is one example. They applying their computer vision technology to over 10 industries and also saves time sets up its corporate VC to invest into other strategic partners. They invest companies doing entertainment company is doing Ai, was healthcare company swinging AI with smarter cities. So since time is actually doing this horizontal expansion to speed up its whole grows, right? There's a number of other AI union comes in China doing similar stuff. Well we notice that for most Ai Unicorns in the u s they are mainly focusing on a vertical because they think it's more capital efficient, right? We think the horizontal expansion can be applied to some USA I startups too, but not all of them.

Speaker 2:          28:06          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          28:07          The second interesting strategy in China is called multiple revenue streams. Uh, AI startups in the U in China, they will provide freemium models for early adopters.

Speaker 2:          28:21          Okay.

Speaker 1:          28:22          But how they make money, right? If this is free, they can get revenues from other streams. That's real cat, this license plate recognition system as an example. So in China, when's these companies? Butte, these systems, it's hard to, for them to sell to this shopping mall owners. Right? Because shopping on there, I don't want to pay much for that. They say, oh, I don't need you to pay Etsy. I would give it for you, give it to you for free. But in exchange,

Speaker 1:          28:52          let me put some ads in the entrance. Now they sell the ads advertisements to other companies to make money. By doing so, it covers their cost by later on where more and more shopping was half their systems. It's easier for them to see all to many other shopping was. So actually this is similar to the [inaudible] gross strategy. Well like Google provide free services for consumers, right? So that the adoption can be much faster. So Chinese UNICORNS actually applying this interesting growth strategy in B two c space to be B because B two B in China is so hard. They need to sync clever ways to getting into the B two c space to accelerate adoption. So they

Speaker 2:          29:42          try these kinds of growth strategies. As I said, B two C B two B is tougher. In China, it's the customer adoption is slow. So they need to expand to multiple industries as soon as possible. Secondly, there's squirrels, pressure from investors in China. So in China, investors used to seek B2C grows, which is more like explanation, exponent, exponential growth. We're in B two B space is harder. So you needed to expand to multiple industries to achieve faster grows and suddenly there's high pressure from the fierce competition in China, right? So since time is actually competing with these companies in a lot of industries, right? These companies all raised huge amount of money. So the competition is really high. So these companies will try to get into different industries faster than competitors.

Speaker 1:          30:44          Now the takeaway for us startups is that for some startups you can try horizontal expansion, right? If you have a core technology and this technology can be applied to multiple industries, you may try this kind of growth strategy. Some examples like self driving technology, we can apply to auto retail security. If you do security robots, supply chain management, if you can do robots in warehouses, right? For robotic process automation and also for fraud detection, you can try a similar strategy because it can be applied to many industries. Secondly, the takeaway on the multiple revenue streams, I think a U S B Two B startups can think of as a revenue stream than just a customer. Subscribe your services. This actually can speed up the customer adoption, right? If you apply this strategy in the US, maybe you can go much faster than your competitors. So lastly, I want to talk about some opportunities for us startups. So first, uh, you can get into more markets as I mentioned, the China and other emerging markets. So secondly, you as startups can learn from China's practices, especially in B, two C and PTG spaces. Southerly, it's interesting too looking at industries with less competition. So there are more opportunities for people to start new AI startups. Forsley a company is true, the leverage, some new tech trends in AI.

Speaker 1:          32:35          Um, so for the third opportunity, uh, startups can step into industries with less competition. So we probably the numbers, we find that for certain industries there's high capital concentration, meaning startups already raised large rounds of capital. So the competition can be high. But for new startups, it's good to look, look at some industries with less competition. For example, education, travel, energy, retail space, tech, aquaculture materials, and many others. So in this space is no company actually raised huge around huge round of capital. So it's easier for startups to getting to, there's less competition. So maybe it's good to pay attention to these industries.

Speaker 1:          33:26          So the first opportunity is to look at the new technology trends in Ai. I briefly summarize into three categories. Why is for data processing a Iot Ai plus Iot edge computing five g these technology or allow more real time processing of large number of large volume of data? A second, the catch query is computing power. For example, tensor processing unit GPU, right? It's powered by Google. I think it's a good technology to leverage to speed up the whole AI computation. Quantum computing is on the way. Um, we may still need it to wait a few years before it's gets more better developed, but it's promising there. So the category is a new optimism's again is one example. You can use it to generate very real fake images. For example, some companies are using again to generate faked training data for AI systems, right? You don't need to get a lot of data. Now you can use the sis algorithm to generate a more training data. Some companies are thinking of applying again to do some creation work. Uh, transfer learning. When you apply your AI technology from one industry to others, you can transfer some knowledge you already learned in wine industry, right? If you also expand your system from one country to others, transfer learning can be also helpful. Uh, federated running, you can do collaborative collaborative machine learning, right? Without centralize the training data, right? You can do more like distributed computing when training a larger system.

Speaker 1:          35:17          Okay. To summarize today, I shared with you four key observations. First, R and D, USAA is ahead of China. Secondly, for manufacturing, China has some advantages that u s company can leverage. So that a, B, two C, B two B us is ahead of China, but in B two C and B to g, uh, Chinese car companies are actually very strong. So it's good for B two B companies here to expand to China. And also for B, two C and B, two g industries US startups can learn from China's success. The fourth episode, Asian is Chinese UNICORNS. I adopt unique growth strategies. I think for most startups in Europe, in the US, maybe you could learn something from China's growth strategies so that you can get faster customer adoption. Uh, the opportunity is for the u s companies first go into more markets. Secondly, uh, you can learn from China's practices. Thirdly, getting into industries with less competition. I think there's a huge amount of opportunities for AI startups to do right? You can solve big problems in these industries with less competition. Lastly, pay attention to this new tech trends and you can leverage some of the technology to beauty your Unicom right in the future. Thank you everyone.

Speaker 2:          36:53          [inaudible].
