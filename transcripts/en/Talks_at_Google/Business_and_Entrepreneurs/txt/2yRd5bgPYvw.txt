Speaker 1:          03:07          yeah, those have been recognized by CNN as Africa is Queen of media who conquered the continental. So once again, welcome. Thank you for having me. It's really great to have you guess which is a whole team switching roles. So, um, a lot of people have journals, right? And a lot of people struggle to make the jump required to achieve those dreams, especially when it involves going into a new space. Now that's something you've done quite a few times in your career from the early days you left the security of a upbeat employment. So to set up an HR consultancy firm, we glorious associates. Subsequently you started a talk show moments we mo, which was new territory for you. What inspired you and give you the courage to take those initial steps?

Speaker 4:          04:04          When I decided to leave as a mobile, it was a really big jump for me because yes, there's nothing like working in oil and gas in Nigeria. I mean it's a, it's a job for life so to speak, unless you do and you to doable. But if you just go to work and do the normal things, you know, you get paid well, you know, you've got a pension or build a nice house and everything really if they need to be just fine. Um, but I think that as an entrepreneur or for me, you know, there's this, for me, there was this unsettling feeling that there was certain things that I felt that I had to do. And I think when that feeling comes, it's, it can be obsessive. It can almost be as if it's an addiction of some sorts. You know, you just feel that you have to do everything within your power to achieve that particular obsession.

Speaker 4:          05:03          So yes, I had a great job and the other day it was actually the birthday of the ta to the old deal of Exxonmobil. So she had invited me to come and it was just last Friday and I went along to enter and I saw all that. They were colleagues there and I was thinking to myself, wow, it could have been a really comfortable life. But then I decided otherwise. And the thing is that when you decide otherwise, there are no guarantees about that decision that you have taken. You don't know how it's gonna turn out. So at times I'm like, my God, what about if we had gone wrong? You know. But I think sometimes you need to take those steps because what really happens if it goes wrong? What is the what? What is? So for me I'm always like, what is the possible worst thing that can happen?

Speaker 4:          05:51          The possible wasn't that can happen is go to get another job. So I think once you understand that you are not afraid of what's the worst outcome can be and you then look at the positivity of what the upside can be and then once you are prepared, I think preparation is important. You can't just go into wanting to leave paid employment without having had a secure plan about what you're going to do once you have left paid employment. So before I left, I was kind of like walking on two sides of the street at the same time. You know, it had started that Rollins already working with Exxon Mobil. You have to declare absolutely everything. So I declared that I did have an interest in a consulting firm. We were doing some business. I did employee some stuff to look after the business for me. So when I could see that there was, there were many more possibilities and I can't achieve those possibilities by staying in a nine to five job, a then had to decide about resigning.

Speaker 4:          06:55          And I was warned about resigning. I was told that Melissa, you can go to his project and I've gone to Houston on sort of three months, you know, I'm sort of out of station work opportunities, um, some shorter. So I had all this opportunities there. Um, and also there's more you can grow hair, why you'd buy my, he said, well, don't leave. And I just said, I have to leave, you know, and I just have that punch knowing that okay, once I'm out of it as a mobile, I have no alternative now than to do absolutely everything within my power to make that transition work. So I did plenty of notice, six months notice. And whilst I was doing that, it was sort of trying to build up on the outside, sort of find an office and find stuff and you know that Vic Lawrence on the right footing so it can be staring.

Speaker 4:          07:48          You can't just leave. You do have to plan. There are no guarantees and is going to work, but I always believe that you know with a great plan, if you're ready to work hard and if you put God first, you know I do believe that you will get the results that you need. Even of course you're going to be challenged, you're going to go to many, many meetings and people are going to say no to you, but for me each time I hear no and like I'm one, you know, and one notch closer to a yes because I totally believe in the law of averages. Everybody cannot see no. At some point you're going to get to that yes is that he has going to help me break even that month and I can be able to pay my salary is that month. At some point you have to understand that you can't go into business thinking that you're gonna make a huge profit.

Speaker 4:          08:33          As soon as you set up that business, that business has to grow. You're going to have to look at the fact that you may not be able to take extensive holidays so you not able to do all the things you could even do whilst viewer fully employed. What are the sacrifices that you're ready to make to make that business work? Because sometimes we're not ready for the sacrifice. You want to continue living the life that you lead when you are being paid nine to five and there was a big company car and there was this and that was the other. You may have to just take a step back to see what those things are that you're going to have to just say, well, I can't do that for now. You know? So, um, yeah, I don't think that to answer the question.

Speaker 1:          09:10          Absolutely very, very well. And you talk, talking about making it work right? With the Florence associates, that was an area of your expertise because you were head of Exxon Mobil. Yes, that's a part that is a bit more familiar for a lot of setting up a business and your area of expertise. But that does not guarantee success. It doesn't. So what were the things that you put in place to make it work?

Speaker 4:          09:34          Well, the first thing I did was to get a small office. Um, make sure that I employed a few experts that I could afford at the time. Um, because one thing I find about going into entrepreneurship is that sometimes the people, the best people that you want your content really afford them because they're themselves want to become entrepreneurs and they want to do other things. So, you know, you have to sort of calm the markets to find the best people that you can, um, and offer them the necessary incentives for them to come on board as part of your team. So that was really important for the being an HR person. They knew that it was important to have the right team in place. So it's about having the right team. It's about, it was about having a work environment and that I thought was attractive enough for clients to be able to visit.

Speaker 4:          10:17          Um, it was about setting up all those processes and procedures they can show you have a phone that's working, they can show you have letterhead and the can you have an email address. I mean in those days there was only high Perrier so I emailed, nothing was Vic had high period.com. Um, it's not like today where you can sort of, you know, doors. It's, it's incredible how things have changed. But at one point, or you could do in their journal to get an imminent as what you had to go to high period. Um, so we had Vicky, taper.com set up all the people work and then you start the cold calling, you then start to run in your business. You then start going out for business meetings. You then start trying to persuade everyone to come on board and to do business with you. And what I used to say to my team then was that you can't go in there Dijuan expecting that they're going to give you that business.

Speaker 4:          11:03          They're going to have to find it. There has to be a pure three of which are going to have to go out there, find out what their needs are and keep going back and keep going back until at some point you're going to pick up neither some small small crumbs and then in a near turn into, you know, prove yourself and then they're going to trust you more and they're going to trust you more. And I think that's basically what we started doing. We just made sure when we're just out there every day covering every possible opportunity that we found, you know, with all the bands, with all the Telcos, with all the FMCG is with absolutely. Even in those days even, you know, public sector government work. So we're just basically just out there, you know, just sort of reaching out to everyone. Um, and what I noticed was that it was important for me to be the chief marketing officer of the company. You can impress someone to do that role, but ultimately lot of it bolted down to what you were also doing in trying to make things happen at the same time. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          11:57          yeah, yeah. Very interesting. And I see your point as well as an entrepreneur, you're pretty, you know, you own the vision and the chief marketer especially. Yes.

Speaker 4:          12:08          And you've got to get everyone else to buy in, into that vision and own the vision and take responsibility for the achievements of division.

Speaker 1:          12:15          Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then you suck up into which was, and I know before that then

Speaker 4:          12:19          there was the protest hotel, local parks. It was awkward park. So whilst I was busy with the Clarus, what I had found was that there weren't really any purpose built, treating a conference facilities in Nigeria would use the Sheraton hotel. Any character would just, the equal hotel would even use a place called city TCC augury, which is outside of Lagos on the way to Egypt. Um, and in those days there were no fools. They don't know falls. I need today the world has changed. People don't know how lucky they are. A time setting up the business in the Nigeria of today versus what it was like back then. You know, so I would have a teen in TCIS yogurt, I'll be dialing the number two, get some new to them. Maybe after a hundred tries I would get through to some landlines are started with it's six zero, whatever it was in those days, you know, so we did a lot of training there.

Speaker 4:          13:08          Um, so for me the challenge then was, okay, you're going to focus on training and development, but where are the purpose built centers for this it cover turn. There could be a wedding going on next door and you have a training event going on. People can't concentrate. Pretty much the same happened at the Sheraton Hotel. Jesus, you're what's really far. I started thinking about putting together a center, you know, started pretty much as just a center that could, you know, you could sleep there, you could also have the training center there. Um, and then one fine day I was at a cocktail, which is why it's important to go out and network. And then I want you to Dick Kramer, the cleaners, a lovely, um, old Amanda's been in Nigeria probably for about 50 years is actually a set of essential and KPMG and it's been like a mentor to me over the years.

Speaker 4:          13:53          And I said, Dick, you know, I've got this project, you know, we really want to start my own sort of like TCC augury um, and said to me about, no, why don't you brand it? Why not get a group like the Protea hotel involved to brand? So that now got me off on another trail of, okay, let's see if we can get them involved. And eventually, initially they said no, but sometimes people say, no, you have to ask, why are they saying no? So went back again and again and again. Eventually they said yes, we had done some plans initially we had to change the plans to the most suitable to a hotel. The cost of investment of building the Pulitzer Hotel went off like 10 fold from it. Just being a little nice little screening center to it. Now having some sort of, you know, three star standard.

Speaker 4:          14:34          Um, of course I was invested in it. Um, and I found that my investment in terms of my shareholding was dwindling because I couldn't afford to take on the huge investment that it was. I mean, also the five at the time, the project cost in those days was $10 million and I just wasn't to be able to do it alone. So I have to say to myself, do you want to see this become a reality? Even though you may only, you may end up owning a smaller share or do you just want to sit back and say, well, I'm just in a good and a little center, which may not get all this branding and this, you know, um, or do you want others to come in and be a part of it so that, that you can be a much bigger dream? And I said to myself, I'm going to go the route of letting me get other investors in.

Speaker 4:          15:13          So they've got Uba trustees involved. Um, we also got a mid will show his involvement as the ink. And that's basically how we got that project off the ground. So that was my second major project after having left Exxon mobile. Um, and then it was a few years after that. But um, yeah, I dunno. Sometimes I, yeah, the idea is just calm. And I think that sometimes for me, um, when I'm invited to speak on being asked, you know, what inspires you, where do the ideas come from? I have to just see is God, my son is a little bit basic and it sounds simple in its sound. Yeah. Right. But that is the truth because what I find often happens to me is, and I will say this to anyone, never go to sleep without a notepad, by your bed and a pen. Because for me, any idea that I've had is coming in the middle of the notes, that Aha moment to just yes.

Speaker 4:          16:04          And, and, and those ideas come and I find that if I haven't noted it down, by the time you wake up, you may have forgotten it. So I find that it's, the clarity for me is always at some point in the middle of the night. And I instantly just wake up and then I just write and write and write and write. And then I transfer that into some sort of PowerPoint presentation. And then I needed to go out there and sell the idea. So that's happened one night. The Inspire African dream, just key. Even the name is my Africa cane. Um, the name more with mold didn't come for a while,

Speaker 1:          16:37          but what have you been thinking? What was it like literally out of the blue? Because it looks like you're very good at identifying gaps in your mind.

Speaker 4:          16:46          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          16:47          So was that sort of in the space? You know, and we're thinking and then you've got clarity. Yeah, well it's sort of just like a light, like a flash. The

Speaker 4:          16:55          thing is, you know, the even ends a little bit in setting up get, Lawrence was easy because it wasn't easy, but pretty much it was the same line of what I'd been used to. And then sort of during the hotel project I wasn't going to run the hotel. So again, I could see that. Okay. And it was also, there was some sort of, you can see the alignment between and Mclarens and our servicing. Yes. Um, the Pulitzer Hotel at the time. So this move in some moments with Mo when that one came, I was concerned, I was concerned because you know how you're like, why are you going to tell? What are people going to think, you know? Um, and you know, we live in a society whereby sometimes, you know, people get the wrong end of the stick, you know, and then we're telling a particular person about the sound or the person could see if the hair wants to become a presenter to the presenter.

Speaker 4:          17:45          But for me it was more than that. It was about the fact that we needed to be able to have a conversation around the things on the issues that are important to us as a people within the continent. And within Nigeria more specifically. I mean, yes, I have watched the Oprah Winfrey show. I have watched the Ellen degeneres. I mean, I can't do the Ellen thing. I mean, she's so funny. I like how did she do it? I don't know. You know, at the time there was dozens of terror that's shoe. So there were all these shows. Well on the end, that platform. So I went in to have a discussion with them that um, about the fact that, you know, when I gathered the courage and I had done the presentation at, this is what happens with a lot of people about the idea of, you know, went in to do a presentation to them just to see what they would think.

Speaker 4:          18:26          And the initial response at the time was, why do we need to show, we already have a lot of talk shows and it's incredible how the nude for local content has changed in the last 12 to 13 years. Because then we didn't even have, we didn't seem to have an appetite for looking at content. We didn't seem to crave it. We did seem to want it. We don't seem to carry for dentists. Well, if it didn't even exist. So I kept saying to them, I think there's been to be a need for sure like this. And my reasons are that yes, I am traveling. I can relate to some of the topics and the things that have been said on those shows. I mean, if I want me to go, if needed that particular day or posts talking about weight loss and they're going to be talking about eating asparagus or carrots or whatever they may be, but how is that relevant to a Nigerian entity that wants to lose weight, where it should be to find a struggles we're in?

Speaker 4:          19:17          So for me it was about bringing this message home and seeing that how do we do with issues in our environment it's in that is beating his wife and you know, she's a victim of domestic abuse. How is that sure in America born to help her overcome that battle in Nigeria. Meanwhile, there are so many associations that are dealing with domestic abuse, who you can call out to in Nigeria who were having no facetime about having that conversation with people that they can say, listen, if this is happening to you, I'm here to help you. I was a victim now I'm evictor. There were no opportunities for that. How come we're not celebrating our own people that were achieving certain things in the world of fashion and music and so on and so forth. Now we have all the blogs, we have all of that.

Speaker 4:          20:03          We didn't have those things 12 years ago. All we had the humbler city people, if he wanted to know what was happening to x, y, zed, if it's totally comes alive in the last decade, it has exploded, you know? So it was really about telling them that there was a need. Then God, eventually Joe Honda, who was then the mg of Avnet eventually said, okay Mo, I'm going to buy this idea, but you know what? I can afford it. I don't have money to condition you, but I will license your show. So he now suggested that you go to look for sponsors. I've kind of been in the sponsor's game prior to starting moments with my, I didn't have a clue, but I thought, okay, in England I don't, during the summer, I don't know this sort of sales jobs and I've been told you can't sell signs to the tuition, so go out there and sell.

Speaker 4:          20:53          So I went around, I went to the banks, I went to the Tel calls to try and sell moments with more looking at what would the benefits be, an opening billboards saying brought to you by Xyz company, adverts in between the show product placements, maybe if your color is red, will have read in the background. So I had to now start thinking about, okay, what are all those things I'm going to do to get them to commit? Because you can't just keep saying to somebody, be a sponsor. What is the value? What is the value you're giving to the sponsor? And then it happens to us everyday people going to sit in, I need a partner, major partner, how you want the exposure on the channel, but what are we getting in return? So we need to get value so that we can give you some value as well.

Speaker 4:          21:33          So that's sort of opened up my eyes to the world of sponsorships and how to close those sort of sponsorship deals. And um, you know, had gone to one particular bank at the time and they were like, Oh yes, I wanted the Md. Had said we're going to do it, and then this particular MD and not later hired a new head of corporate who now said, we're not going to do it, and I was totally like devastated, but I thought to myself, am I going to let that get me down? I said, no, to pick myself up. I caught a good friend of mine at the time called Maca Darcy who runs a swirling Cavita. I'm consulting, you know mark? I said, Mark Seniors, your job, you're not supposed to. They did. What do I do now? And at the time I was looking for a huge amount of money to start this show.

Speaker 4:          22:11          He said, look, break it down. Why don't you just see if we could even do one season of this show. If you do one season successfully, then you can start grilling from there. That advice basically is what happened. It took me a while to have a meeting with them. Then the MDL stay back and session, like in February I did my usual presentation to him. I've never met the man in my entire life. And I walked in there thinking, I wonder what he thinks. And eventually he said, we're not going to sponsor but we want to invest in your company. And then they have the SME scheme and they bought into inspire Africa and that basically gave us the seed capital. We needed to go build our own studio because we had to do the old space when we're going to have this conversation. It doesn't exist.

Speaker 4:          22:53          It's not like in the space where you can just walk into a studio, dry hire the studio and record. We couldn't do that. So we then have to sort of get our studio space and with within a city mall and an empty space, we sort of did it up as best as we could. And that's what we started doing this and before the went on a training course. Yes, yes, yes. Recall hearing you say that you have never done it before. It was, I'm going into a new space. Yes, yes. How did you develop your own capacity and also, um, position yourself in a way that you and the show? Well, before we started, thank God we had Skype and so they came on board as an investor and also as a sponsor. And Luckily, eventually I was able to persuade Ntn to come on board as a sponsor.

Speaker 4:          23:47          So I have two strong brands that were associated with the moments with move brand. And the very first interview I did, my goodness was professor want to show income and I chased and chased till he said yes because I thought I need to start the show with a band. I need to have a really special guest. And that's, that sort of did the show the credibility that it needed. I went on a training course to learn how to be a presenter. At the time Oprah had launched her 25 years, you know, those sort of video DVD boxes. I bought the entire thing I would watch and watch, um, running a training consultancy firm. I've got one of my instructors turn, you'll see or see me at the time to train me. So would train every weekend I'm at the protein hotel. He would record me, would play back, would look at you no more.

Speaker 4:          24:37          You need to improve on this and improve on that. So I did all those things if I got started. So that kind of gave me a little bit of confidence. I was still very um, nervous. But I just found that once I got into the flow of the conversation, I, once I was researched, it's important to prepare for your interviews. Um, so I think a lot of advice to young girls out there that want to become presenters, it's not really about how you look or the shoes you have on. Yes, that's nice too. But it's really going to be about the quality of the conversation and the questions that you're asking and the topics that you'll select it. Because I found when I launched notice I was, I kept saying, we need to have topics that are exciting and people are gonna want to watch.

Speaker 4:          25:24          So one of my episodes was this lady, um, that said that she was the parent to 11 to seven children that she claimed she had in seven months. So we did lots of research about, okay, well for the blood test we interviewed her. She was a parent at the end of the return that she wasn't the parent. Um, I had another crazy episode with a alarm robber. This guy was an ExxonMobil and he sat and told me and Tyler will, how we got into it and how we got out of it. Um, another crazy episode was the snake, the snake eating episode actually faces physically can ground by sneaking it in Nigeria. And it's neat. I'm thinking and the lady came to the studio with the sneaker looks like chicken, I cetera and try this one today. So it was really about finding those topics that would engage, that would be interesting rather than just another, you know, domestic abuse. We covered, of course, we celebrated lots of people on the shows. Um, I mean I probably did a thousand episodes before I decided that I wanted to kind of take a back seat before we sort of started on this journey of ebony life television still on moments. So you have several moments in the course of I think it's over 10 years now. Yes, yes, yes. 2016 yes. So in 2006 to 2016, 10 years. Yeah. From the discussions whether personal lessons that you've learned

Speaker 1:          26:44          that really had a profound impact.

Speaker 4:          26:48          The thing is when people that you don't know open up to you, they literally be, you find yourself in a situation whereby you think you really, I mean, that's sharing things within that she may otherwise not have known. And one of the episodes that I did for me that was very early on in my career that I found really touching was when that plane crashed in for support and it had all those children from the, um, the school dinner, which own the flight. And I had Mrs and McCree who lost her only daughter

Speaker 3:          27:21          that [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          27:24          the studio and it was sitting next to a woman that has, she not only does she come on the show, but she was able to share her pain and you know how she dealt with the fund that her only child has been killed in a plane crash. And you find that those intimate moments are just moments where you're like, you can never just get them back and you know, people are sharing things with you that are really, really private and you're the custodian of that inflammation and how you treat it and how you treat them. I found to be, um, I had to find my own way of dealing with those kinds of issues and he would leave a show at times and you're like, oh my God. And you then, and I used to do like four shows a day because the world of production, that's the only way can make financial sense or can, we didn't want it to, you use the cooler to use your, they'd still be recording. So, um, so at times you'd have to go from doing a very happy episode to doing a very sad episode to doing a different sort of episode and how to your head is kind of, yeah, like in different places and I'm coming from a world where I haven't done this before. So having to deal with all of that was kind of, yeah. Challenge had its challenges. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          28:45          Yeah. And it sounds like it was a lot of hard work.

Speaker 4:          28:48          It's wrong

Speaker 1:          28:49          what you see on an entrepreneurial success story. It's very easy to celebrate it and to think, told him why am etc. But there's a lot of hardware, genuine hardware that goes into making anything successful.

Speaker 4:          29:00          Very much so. A lot, a lot of hard work. You've got to be worried with searched on whoever the guest is and if anyone asked in Professor Alicia, and I thought, you know what? He's like, you can't fit on the set with, you might not know what you're talking about. So I was petrified of that particular one. I must have read and read and read more than you know, then I would meet for the interview. But you just have to be prepared for every single interview that I did. I had to do our research, I have to have my questions with me and sometimes you know, the response you get has no link to the next question. So you have to be very quick on your feet about how you're now going to sort of go back to them and get the necessary answers that you wanted.

Speaker 4:          29:35          Um, and at times we're going to have technical problems on set. Something isn't working. The generator has Brooklyn. You're like dealing in an environment whereby your counterparts in another country doesn't have to think about these issues. Nobody cares who cares about Palo, who cares about some of those things here. But here you are dealing with those realities. Those are my reality is everyday that I have to deal with. Find a space when I could convert into a studio, find stuff that would understand the vision that could get me the look and feel. Because at the time, as easy as it is, I mean now that we do a thousand hours of programming, it talks show is the easiest format in the world, but no one has to been able to replicate the moments with Newforma in 10 years and not seen in other talk show that has replicated the look and feel of talk.

Speaker 4:          30:21          And for us talking to the simplest thing for us on Ebony Life TV today, we've taken talk to it. It's completely different level from things like moments. Um, now we have women's Z, which is with a much younger crop of young girls who are having a conversation. One of the things that are important to them. We have love lounge, which is about love, sex and relationships. We've got men's corn and just talk about things that men are fascinated about. You know, that women also wants to know about them. Um, we have the broad, which is doing well or doing his own crazy thing. It's all talk. So we've taken the talk and we've kind of given it a twist. So it's, um, it is a lot of work. It is a lot of work. Even convincing sponsors to come on board after you convince them, oh yeah, pay me. You're going to be chasing them around today. Payment. No, you have salaries to pay. You have cool young anybody else to be, they're not going to wait for clients to pay you. You're talking to the bank and you know, facilitating overdrafts, say when they get, didn't all kinds of things just to keep the business going. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          31:16          Yeah. So talking about everything life too. That's one of your more recent home groups. Yes. And I remember the timeline,

Speaker 4:          31:24          oh, about Africa is about to change forever. Forever. Yes. You share the vision behind that. The vision behind that was that, I remember a few years before then I'd interviewed Hillary Clinton and one of the key questions that I said to her was, how do we change the stereotypes about how we are perceived across the world? And she said to me, we have to have people like you speaking on behalf of Africa and putting a different image out there about the continent. Because even with Google, if you Google Africa, what are the first than in does it come up? Is going to be poverty, it's going to be this, it's going to be destruction. It's going to be all of these images that the world view have of our continent. How do we change that world view? It's by creating the reality. That's the other reality that the world needs to see.

Speaker 4:          32:18          And that other reality is showing that the people like him and I in Nigeria showing up as this audience here showing that we have, we are capable. And that was how we came up with a tagline. Every think you think you know about Africa is going to change because we put a positive spin on everything. We didn't create these people. These people already existed, just didn't have a platform through which you could engage with them. So he gave that platform for engagement from let's make comedy. That's nick reality. Let's make talk. Let's make speech at programming. That's to lifestyle. Let's, let's do everything that we can to show the world that this, we have a tiger. You know, we have the stamp that we put on everything, say ebony life TV made in Nigeria for the world. So good things can come out of our constant and out of our country and can be exported. And, and, and that really was what it was all about. I mean, we go out to international exhibitions, um, and people ask us, I don't know if it's a compliment or an insult, they said, what's this really needy Nigeria? Yes, it was made in Nigeria. How about that? I guess we can make things like that because they're so used to just all kinds and we have to be careful about what we put out there.

Speaker 1:          33:28          And, uh, actually interestingly, that's one of our priorities as Google in Nigeria. Just encouraging having local contents. Yes, yes,

Speaker 4:          33:39          yes, yes, yes, yes. Let me look at this conversation we're having today. I mean, it is, you're having it, so thank you. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          33:49          Challenges that you encountered in trying to set, because that's a really big fits right in setting up your own TV channel. Um, everything you've mentioned, parts of that. I know that there were very challenging, but this I think was the, in order of magnitude.

Speaker 4:          34:05          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          34:07          What are the challenges that you went through in setting and money? Setting up and running everything like TV and what support systems and opportunities are. Okay.

Speaker 4:          34:19          I wake up one day and I decided that I wanted to launch a TV channel and um, I had no idea how I was getting to do it, but I just knew that deep down in my spirit to deep down in my soul, God said, moe, go and do this. It's scary. Very scary. Very. And I think sometimes hysteria the dream, the more you need to pursue it because I think there's a message in there somewhere. Cause if it's not scary, then was the challenge. And I'm funny, I'm like, okay, oh you have to do is try. If it doesn't work, it doesn't work. So the idea came and one of the festival I called was my mom. My mom is always, she's my prayer partner. Um, and she said she's my number one fan. So I said, Mommy, I'm doing this thing. My worry.

Speaker 4:          35:04          I drank, I drank low, has she always says that she's paying about it. So the next lesson I took was a friend of mine in South Africa, Sandra [inaudible], Sandra's one of our producers. Then on moments, cause let me, didn't want us just to have a Pan African spin to a lot of our shoes and she would go around Africa sort of shooting similar stories for the show at the time. So I said to Sandra, started to reach and, and sound was like, oh, I know. Sounds really cool and um, what do we do now? Um, so I thought, how did you start to challenge, you know, I couldn't get a license. There was opportunity to get a license for free to edit, all been taken, all gone. Um, but I also felt that it was important to create a platform that could travel and one could use technology to drive and we'd be Pan African at the same time.

Speaker 4:          35:49          So I had a show on the STV as a, let me have a conversation with DSTV. So Joe Honda than had approved the initial aneurysm. I said, Joe, I want to start a TV channel. And it's like, well no, have, you know, they don't just do channels like that, you know, I'm not sure we need another channel but you can try it. So I said, who do I contact? And as it needs to contact political Alexa Albert's as I can. I have an email address. So he gave me her email and this is how it starts. I didn't know her from Adam sent her an email and eventually she responded. She sent me a form that's longer than anything else. Hundreds, not hundreds, but several pages of what is the name of the channel? What is the con? I mean questions that I did not even know because it made me think about, wow, you want to start a channel?

Speaker 4:          36:32          What did you know you're going to have to know this much before you can actually start the channel of the schedule, the types of programs, you know, the budget. I mean, there was so many questions. Eventually I did the best I could to answer the questions and I sent the form back to her. And then I kept chasing her and chasing her and she wasn't answering me because I didn't, they get requests at least 10 to 23 d from, you don't want to set up to the channels from Nigeria. So, um, eventually I said, I'm going to be in South Africa because I was shooting an episode of [inaudible] and could I please come in and see you? So that was my hope of getting in the door. So I went in and had a meeting. So before having the meeting, I then hired someone that was already in the world of media to do me a beautiful presentation around this as a sort of content would have on the channel.

Speaker 4:          37:21          Went in and did the presentation and left the meeting. They said, well, this doesn't, this isn't quite, it's, I was devastated because I actually paid someone quite a large sum of money to do that presentation. Um, it wasn't working so they were like, if you want this channel, you have to go back and do x, y, zed, and we had workshop after workshop after workshop deciding on who was going to be our key Dev. Who Do you really want to speak to across the continent? What is the conversation? What other John [inaudible], what are the hours? How are you going to produce these hours? Who is going to produce these hours? Who is going to do your post production? How are you going to clear things through legal? I mean there is a battle and in half of things you need to play to create one hour of content.

Speaker 4:          38:06          So eventually after several months of now having gone back, having left them and gone back to do another presentation with all of this, if I had to engage a consultant, Axonify, then one in Nigeria to do it because the skill sets don't exist. I found someone in South Africa again had to invest a huge amount of money that could have gone into maybe an ice bag on a holiday. Let's just get this presentation down, letting us do the strategy session. After which we then did the presentation without once back into mortgage choice to present. Then they bought the idea, but now they gave us conditions. This is a beautiful presentation, but you need to raise x, y, zed amounts of money. You need to have his studio before you can do all of this. So you know, which is why I said sometimes you need to pray harder, work hard.

Speaker 4:          38:58          At the same time, a good friend of mine, I had to raise the money and the story about how that reads is what I'd like to share. At the same time, all this is happening. A good friend of mine, [inaudible] says to me, you need to go to cross river and interview the governor. And I was like, I'm kind of his money for my channel. I'm trying to do all these things. I don't really know. But eventually she persuaded me and I also had wanted to do that into for the longest time. I got on a plane on new years day, about five years ago, went to caliber to go and do this interview with His Excellency than at the time governor really murky and his wife are the at the time. But at the same time I had a sponsor for my show moments with Mo and the support.

Speaker 4:          39:46          So had threatened to pull out unless I started having a presence on social media cause I wasn't switching. I was, I didn't know anything about, I was just doing my thing. I've got a PR person registered me on Twitter, do my Facebook and do all of that. So when I got to caliber that evening, I sent a message saying happy new year, lots of law, firm caliber. And someone said to me, what's happening in turnover? I've never been entered in that point in my entire life. So I was with a friend in the car who said, let me take you there. Let's drive around. We went there, beautiful place, beautiful but empty as nothing was into Napa. So the next day when I was going to interview the governor, um, then in Zion ob who was a special assistant said come in and have a conversation with his.

Speaker 4:          40:33          That's the lesser, before you start your interview. I did never, nothing, I didn't know what to say to him. The first thing I said was you accidents. We wanted to not pay as well. He's Very Mc. What's going on. That is how that conversation started. That is how they got the supports would be needed for the channel. Now I didn't know, I mean on one hand you are looking to set up a channel and another hand, a friend is saying come and interview the governor. You have a sponsor saying you need to start to meeting. You put all of that together, you send a tweet message out and Bob's your uncle. Somehow a couple of years later, about 18 months later, Cross River state came on board as our partner. We promised to use that to another studio, um, as our destination point for media. And that was the catalyst for getting ebony life TV started and they also supported us.

Speaker 4:          41:20          Have the fundraising for Ebony Life TV. So at times without putting all those elements together. So when people say to you, what is your recipe? I can't say to you, don't tweet or don't go to [inaudible] with the governor. You're going to have to just work hard enough from the universe to conspire to say, okay, I am going to give you your break. I believe that there are dream makers for all of us out there. We won't have to meet our dream makers. And on the other hand, yeah, you are dream killers. Those are just the kind of way to kill the dream. So you have to balance, you know, the dream killers and the teenagers makers and see how you get out of that cycle. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          41:54          That's lesson I hear as well from just this thing to use is also having your reader on.

Speaker 4:          41:59          Sometimes you think it's going nowhere and sometimes for the hell of it, just go along with whatever it is because you never know where it's going. Lead to never ever know. It could be one night you're out having a drink. You could be in a supermarket, you could be absolutely anywhere when the opportunity comes to you.

Speaker 1:          42:15          Yeah. Yeah. Another thing I think is very good at, and I think that's really critical, negative inertia is finding the right talents. Whether you saw Stalins and whatever seems to be helpful because when I think about ebony life TV and everything you do actually, you have a great day.

Speaker 4:          42:31          We have a fantastic team. How do you find them? Um, again, I think the universe will conspire to sort of be the right people, but I think maybe being a hatred person I think also has helped a great deal in understanding what the processes are that you need to go through to find the right talent. You know, I can't work with anyone on my team, but he's not ready to be playing email at three o'clock in the morning. I know it sounds crazy, but you know, you must be able to work hard. You've got to be able to identify where they're coming from, the things they've done. I mean, there's someone here with me to do is with me today. Um, and Eunice was based in America and I have to plead with her to come back to Nigeria to work with us because even before she joined us as a member of our team, as a head of strategy, we had already started working together on little, little things, not officially, like it was going to go to the states.

Speaker 4:          43:24          She would even proactively volunteer should proactively help me do things without me even asking. And I'm thinking, this is the sort of person you want on your team to be there for you in your own corner. Um, and so eventually I pleaded and said, please come back. And she packed up her bags and she's come back to Nigeria. Um, you know, so for me it's really about just putting your feelers out there and you need to have that fifth sense. You need to be able to say to yourself, is this person going to be a part of your team? And He, you can pretty much sauce are people that work hard and people that are just [inaudible]. I'm sorry to say that, you know, I mean, there are lot of people that just, they're all talk and they're just not going to do the work and I can't deal with that, you know?

Speaker 4:          44:09          So it needed me. I would attend. You're going to make recruitment errors and when you do, you said thank you very much, but it's not going to work out. Bye Bye. You know, and then you move on to the next person. And that's pretty much how I built the team. Um, but I think more than anything it's really just about finding people that can come plug in. And we have a lot of young people with us and they want a car ahead of social media. Let's say she joined us, I don't know, three, four years ago. And you know, it's incredible how she has grown into her job, you know? And it's really just about finding the right team of people and then sharing the dream and then just being conscientious about the things that they need to do. And you're not having to see it a million times before they do it and micromanage them.

Speaker 4:          44:55          You know, for them to practice. What about this, what about that? You know, and we're all learning together and I like to have lots of people around me that even know more than I do about certain things because you don't know it all. I don't know if my daughter is working with ebony life now. She's got some crazy ideas. She's like, mom, we need to do this. And I'm like, okay, we're targeting your age. Okay, I will listen to. So it doesn't, for me it's about making sure we have an inclusive team that you know, they can tell us about things that they think are going to work for the channel of whatever business it is. And we just fly with, with those ideas. And because we're small for us, we're able to just get things done very quickly. We don't have to get to 10 levels of approval before we do them in. Be like you guys, I mean Google it, there's going to be such a, such a massive organization, um, but with also can pretty much say, okay, we're going to run with this so we can execute things really quickly as a small organization.

Speaker 5:          45:44          Awesome.

Speaker 1:          45:48          Questions from the audience, but I'll ask one more question. What keeps you in a joy?

Speaker 5:          45:58          Okay.

Speaker 4:          45:58          I think the, for me, the highlights of my existence, my children, you know, um, I think that for me they are the most important thing in my life. If I had to give everything I have for my kids, I will do so tomorrows and really, and I say that 100%. I would, um, my mom is my, you know, she's my everything, my sisters. Um, I put God before everything. I absolutely do. I just think it's so important for me to have that sense of direction. And you know, what I find interesting is that people don't often know your relationship with God and the neck assumptions about how you've achieved certain things. They don't even know how you've achieved them. And what I find interesting is that, that is my secret. I shadowed a lot, but I think sometimes they're not listening to the fact that if you put him first, if you listen to him TV, it doesn't matter.

Speaker 4:          46:53          I've got this thing six inches on. I've got my lashes, the web, you in my moments when I'm on my knees praying to him, it is between him and I having that conversation and he's saying, more do this. This is the most important thing for you to do. So he guides my every, every move that I do and he just gives me the confidence to go out there and say, there's nothing that is really too much that we can't achieve because with him, you know that all things absolutely possible and that that's, that's what I continue to believe him.

Speaker 1:          47:22          Yeah. So I'm going to pause my and see if there are any questions for our very lovely, yeah.

Speaker 4:          47:37          I think for me, the schools that I started with most Appleby my people skills because I'm so impatient to get things done at times that I'm sure I'm driving everybody around me crazy because I kind of like wanted to happen now because at times I'm like, I might probe manage, I would do it to myself if you can't give it to me now I'm that kind of person. Um, what I think that as we grow, I think skills are something that with age you get better, you'll get better at them because I know I'm a much better person now than I was 10 years ago, 20 years ago. So I think it's gradual. Um, and I think it's also important to keep learning about the skills that you have that you need and to practice. I find I practiced the skills that I need. You know, even public speaking at times I practice because I'm not the best public speaker I want to be.

Speaker 4:          48:26          And I'm constantly challenged by the fact that I'm not going to say no to going out and speaking in public, but I'm going to learn to be a better public speaker. So it's really about teaching yourself those skills that you need. And I think skills come with habit. Once you practice it enough times then becomes a reality for you. So whatever skills that you think you lacking, just work out them. If it's a, you're not smiling, you know what keeps smiling, it's mild enough times you're going to find yourself just smiling without even thinking about it because the mind is a very funny thing. It just kind of just takes over and does those things without even thinking about it.

Speaker 4:          49:08          From my own personal experience, it's, it's pretty, from my experience, it's pretty much been about the fact that you need to share the dream. You know, if you have a big dream, you can't do the dream by yourself. You're going to have to look for other people that you can invite him to make the dream a reality. Um, when I was setting a lot of the chlorine's I didn't need support because it was, I started very small, but when I moved on to do the [inaudible] hotel, Oakwood Park, it was a $10 million. I don't have $10 million. I had to now go out there and do a proper placement, informal, um, you know, and get people to buy into the project and it takes time. You're not going to say to someone come and invested in and I've got to just sign the check tomorrow. No. Some will say yes, some will say no.

Speaker 4:          49:49          So there was it, there's a, there was a process of engagement. It's pretty much the same thing happened with moments with Mo had to go out there, as I said earlier and engage and get people to buy into the dream. Ebony Life TV was the same thing. I didn't have the required capital to set up a TV channel, so I had to find a partner. And those dreams can sometimes take time, you know, to, to become a reality because cash is king and you need the cash. But you just have to just keep watch dear focus that you want to achieve this. When those things will come into the plea in that, you know, and I said with moments of when I started with one season, but initially my whole idea was I was looking for money to get me comfortable for a year. I want, I couldn't find one or three year, I decided to take Max advice and just do one season.

Speaker 4:          50:32          So if you can find ways to start small, then you start small. And then once people can see success back. Now everybody in agile wants to do a film after the success of the parts. And they're like, can we come up our time with you? Do you want money? People are offering us money to partner, you know, so success has its own, you know, successes. And then others will come and say, can you come and be, you know, the parts of your own success. So once you can achieve some level of success, then you just have to just invite, but never be afraid of inviting people in to share in your dream. I mean, you've got to be careful, do your due diligence and all of that, but all things being equal, nobody. I don't think there's anyone that owes anything a hundred percent anymore. It doesn't happen if that, that is a tough one because you know, there are some women that decide that when it's time to raise the kids, I'm out.

Speaker 4:          51:30          I'm just going to focus on raising my children. And then there are some people like me who are a little bit more selfish, who believe that they can have everything. So you need to be single minded about the five that I love my children, but at the same time I have this dream, so how am I going to be able to juggle all of those things? You need to have a great support system around you. You need to spend quality time with your children because I find a lot of housewives that called themselves housewives. They're not even at home. Half the time they're probably out having lunch or doing the nails or some way. So they have deceived themselves. That's the of it. So in that regard you that you are working, you therefore make it. It became part of my day to sit, I'm going to spend x, Y, z amount of time with my children.

Speaker 4:          52:15          I'm gonna, you know, we're going to go out on this day, we're going to take this holiday, we're going to do those things. And when it's really tasteful need to take myself out of work, a hundred percent equity. My son was going to go to his a levels and I daughter, I had to physically take the time out and say, I'm not working for a month. I'm going to go. We're going to have to search for, we even do a levels in England and that was it. And you close down, shop on, you come back to do those things. So it's really about prioritizing. And I think what happens with working mothers is that I think your kids become strong. I hope so. Mine have might have that they become strong. Knowing that my mom is working. You're also a role model to your daughter that she's going to know that her mom has worked your son.

Speaker 4:          52:56          My mom has worked hard so that when he marries his wife, he's not going to say sits at home because it's seen, it's one of us working. So I think we're also preparing our kids for the fact that it's okay to have your dreams are valid to burrows. Please don't be limited the suits for plagiarism here, your dreams are valid. You can take that on to know that you can go out there and achieve your dreams the same way that your husband is achieving his dreams. Right? So why can't you achieve yours? So it's, it's, I think it's just about finding the fact that you need to find the happy medium, that happy balance and you know, have a good support system and to let the kids know you really love them when you're there. That's what has worked for me. But I can't say that sin recipe will work for everyone because everyone is different. You know, we're not all the same. So my DNA would be different to the next person's DNA, but that is pretty much what I have done. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          53:47          that's interesting as well. You touched on something. Do you believe you believe that it's possible?

Speaker 4:          53:54          Um, not all the time. I think something will good. You can't have it all, all the time. You cannot, it's not possible. So you have to decide on what is important to you. It's like the woman that decides to stay at home with her kids that wanted a career but couldn't have it. She's had to give certain things off. So I don't think anyone can have it all. I think we just have to try and do the best that we can and you know, live with, you know, just find the as good as we can really. And to be honest with ourselves about the capabilities and the capacities that we have because we can't do everything. The only certain things that we can, we can do. Um, I think we need to just look at ourselves and say, this is who I am. Yes. When I am in this mode of work, I can be obsessive. My Friends gonna think I'm selfish because I didn't want to see anybody, but it stops what gets me to get the results that I need. Then I'm going to do those things and when I'm done then I will find a way to just go back and get back into the swing of things. And Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          55:06          I think we have a lot of talent in Nigeria and if I look at the success of Ebony Life Television, it has been based on the fact that we, I mean one of my biggest concerns at the time when we actually started the channel was where am I going to find the talent? Cause I looked at the TV landscape and I was pretty much appalled by the titans that I saw. So I don't understand the hiring decisions or how people decided to put certain and look at TV. I'm like, why is this person on TV? What skills do they have? Why do they look this way? So for me it was really important to understand the look and feel that we're after and then find the right people that we could put into that looking for living if they didn't have the necessary experience. I mean what means here today or Mimi when we meet, um, she's, she does a lot of, one was one of our presenters on the channel and I remember that.

Speaker 4:          55:51          How she, I mean she's also, I mean she's tenacious. I mean I remember how she hounded me. Don at the time I said I wanted to become a presenter on your channel and I was like, we don't have any spaces. And then she'll keep sending you emails. And then I said, okay, send me your showreel. And then one day we needed to present a full show and that's how she became one of our best presenters. I mean she is so off the mark with just anything. So, but prior to that, did you have any experience really? She had known, but I don't think anybody knows who she is today, two or three years later. So the same applies to our channel. Even a Buka that is doing the big brother in, in, in South Africa is has been on the spot and has been with us for many, many years.

Speaker 4:          56:29          We have in lots of talents in Nigeria, but I think the reason why big brother's been shot there is for business reasons. We are also shooting in South Africa right now. It's just for business reasons. Also the world is a global village. We can't keep limiting ourselves to, oh, I'm fighting this cause that everything must be done in Nigeria. No, I want to do programs in America. I want to do programs in the UK. Then I can sell to make UK broadcaster. Why should my limit be just in Nigerian market? Especially with the night I'd doing what is doing now my guys and I actually off to England to go and shoot some pilots and some of our very good shows with a British cast and we're going to go to America to do the same as an American cast because we need to widen the net.

Speaker 4:          57:14          Shonda Rhimes is a black woman just like I am. She's written with an attorney. I don't think everybody in prison afternoons black, right? So she's just a very talented person that is doing great work in the big world world of media. We have to learn to take that on as well, and to be, to understand that we can go anywhere in the world and make a content and the programming. That's, that's what I think we need to do. We need to just open the blinkers and just see the world widely. What it truly is, and that's what I want to do now that the Niara has crashed and

Speaker 5:          57:44          that you should do the same.
