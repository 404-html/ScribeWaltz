Speaker 1:          00:06          Thank you so much. Thank you David. And for those of you don't know, David, David is really one of the pioneers of executive coaching, really one of the people who I think have written so thoughtfully and inspiring ways about where we can find a life that matters. And that's what's so terrific to have an opportunity to talk with all of you about today. Here at Google. I feel like I've been in a Google office every week. I was just in Singapore and London and New York and I'm on my way to Joburg when this is the front desk at Burg, uh, Google. It's how's it jumbo? And so I feel so welcome when I come here and I love coming to Google because it's a particularly point in time for me because I started on a passion play about 20 years ago where I was in a late night.

Speaker 1:          00:53          Nightcap will admit it was one o'clock in the morning. We were in Switzerland and we were jet lagged and exhausted. And I was talking to a couple of famous Googlers. It was Larry and Sergey. They were at the World Economic Forum and we were all just gushing about having met someone iconic in our lives that we never thought we would need. It was one of his last public appearances. It was Nelson Mandela, and we're thinking about how this guy should have been the most angry man in Africa and yeah. What did he do with his life? He decided to reinvent a life that mattered for millions in rethinking the way that he could have impact and a sense of belonging for a culture, and that set me on a path that would be life changing for me. I had been building businesses most of my career as an entrepreneur and I decided that I wanted to pursue this question of how to create a life that matter.

Speaker 1:          01:45          Could we find the DNA? Could we find some ingredients by interviewing enough successful, high achieving people around the planet and could we unlock some of those secrets? Please come and sit down. I'm loving the opportunity also to be on live streaming and for those of you who did get books and didn't get books, I'll make sure that you get free copies. So just ping me through the Google network and for those that I might see in other cities, please let me know if you're interested. I'd love to share with you a little research that we learned about how to create a life that matters and so here's where I want to go. With that, I want to start with just a little piece of archival footage here of just the first 60 seconds of the first interview we did starting in 1998 and I'm going to bring you to present and then share with you eight of the principals out of the 36 that we learned and the eight that I've picked is big because they are the most, I think, hidden from our souls and from the public. They are the ones that aren't talked about, the ones that have the biggest impact. And let me share with you, herb Kelleher, kind of a famously happy guy who seems to create a life that matters, even though he's really just running a discount airline.

Speaker 2:          02:59          Oh, so what job are we going to get it? And you can't really screw up.

Speaker 1:          03:15          Hey, how are you? So it was amazing to be able to meet people like herb, who in a sadly on unusual way, when you meet CEOs aren't necessarily the most happy people. And when you talked to him, you could see how that filters through the organization. How many of you've ever been on southwest airlines? Of course. Yeah, we've all had to do that. You, I was kinda coming here on southwest airlines and I had the typical safety talk that you get on southwest. Now these people can't be paid all that much. Not In money at least. But why is it that they're just a little happier? A little bit more engaged, maybe a little insane. Have you noticed this? We were like rolling out on the runway and the flight attendant was giving us the safety talk. You know, nobody's listening. We're all reading our devices.

Speaker 1:          04:00          Can you starts to pretend to be angry. He says, guys, if this plane falls out of the sky, would you like to know the documentation? You can hear the thud. You know, people are dropping everything. What's this guy up to us? It's okay. Here's what's going to happen. If there's a change in cabin pressure or there's a crisis in the year and they're going to be the little yellow masks that pop out of the ceiling. Now folks, those are oxygen masks. Now don't start to ask, why is my mask smaller than his mask? Why is my mask inconveniencing the meeting that I'm supposed to hold? No, grab of the mask, put it on yourself first and then put it on your child. And if you have more than one child, you might want to stop and consider which one really has the most potential.

Speaker 1:          04:40          And that's what I want to talk about here because this is how when you talked to her, when we did that interview, he was, he drank a, I think a full scotch. Uh, the, the bottle was empty by the time we were talking. Two hours didn't seem to affect him in bed. He went through two packs of cigarettes, was blowing this, the it off screen. He said, you know, mark and people will not decide and choose explicitly and intentionally to live a life that matters. We have to take a moment and recalibrate. You know, we're not Nelson Mandela. There's probably many times during your life when you redefine what success means and what that definition of success is. So let's look at the factors that we discovered in this research. And one of them had to do with the fact that in a world that's so volatile and changing, we're all on this mission to find a sense of belonging, to create a life that matters.

Speaker 1:          05:27          And the, the primary principle that seemed to flow through all of these came out of a research project as I mentioned. And the project started with bill to last. I don't know if you've ever heard of bill to last. You know, it was one of those great books, one of the many books that was a bestseller and half of it was true. And I had the opportunity to be a part of the research team at Stanford that was working on this, but part of that slave labor that was doing all of the conjoint analysis and Jerry when it Wharton joined us, Howard Moskowitz at Harvard, Benita Thompson led the research. She's a behavioral psychologist. We work with Jim Collins and we then went on a survey of people who we thought had an impact for 20 years or more. In other words, the cohort that we went after were not people who are one hit wonders or short term success stories.

Speaker 1:          06:10          We're talking about people who had impact for at least two decades. These were people who had been living a life that matters and they might be celebrities, they might not be. Many of them were. I did have a very eclectic experience. It started with Nelson Mandela had the opportunity to meet Maya Angelou. I did many programs with her. The Dalai Lama met the famous Googlers and the folks at Microsoft from the very early days. That just shows how you know this is going back to 1998 when when Larry bought a youtube and was talking about that at the, at the forum and into the present day and the adventure ended up finding these criteria, 36 criteria in 2000 interviews that we did and then we did a survey in 110 nations to try to force rank what were these criteria on the definition of success and what we found was that one of the great core competencies of people like yourself who have achieved is that you start to work at putting your demons in a place where you can perhaps harvest the energy from them.

Speaker 1:          07:12          That it's a bit about mastering fear and ambition and let me share with you a little bit what I mean about that. What we found was that people who have been able to find a connection with a life that matters tend to be great at failure. Winners lose often and they lose more often than losers because losers are usually trying to avoid the risk of making mistakes that winners, people who have impact year in and year at are usually experts at learning, at iteration, at being able to profit from failure and from change. And I don't know about you guys, I've kind of often feel this way in all of my work. I always have way too much more to do than I possibly can and short it. Short cuts kind of never apply when we do this. So here's the first principle at work. We found that anyone who had really swung for the fences in high achievement had also failed big time and they were experts at trying to harvest their failures.

Speaker 1:          08:13          Let me give you just one exercise that we can all apply in how we would rethink any sort of disaster that we've ever been in. So Richard Branson, who was one of the early sponsors of this book, had a tragedy occur where he had been collecting 30 years of his notes in the family home on Necker island. And it burned down four years ago. Quite famously, a bolt of lightning came through the roof. He had been sleeping on the beach and the house was filled with people and his 90 year old bum eve was able to escort actually everybody out of the house when this big explosion occurred and she's still bragging about it to this day, eve is, and he said, I learned something really profound that day. Obviously I was really worried about people being hurt, but then I realized how helpless I was in that disaster.

Speaker 1:          08:57          I was down on the beach, he was starting to run to do the rescue and he realized he wasn't fully clothed, he was barefoot. He ran straight into a cactus. It wasn't a pleasant experience for him and he realized something that informed 30 years of his work that had gone up in smoke and that is that if you did want to restart a life or a career or a business, do you think you would do that in exactly the same blueprint that you had leading up to that point of disaster? In other words, one of the greatest ways to think about looking forward in your life is to restart the old life. In other words, would you have the same blueprint for that House that you rebuild? Would you have that same work plan for your career or would you do things differently? Would you think about every aspect or process of your work or career in the same way?

Speaker 1:          09:47          I don't think so that one of the best ways we can think about our goal setting every year as it is to say, what if I were to start over? What would I do here? Friendly? How can I avoid just paving the cow path as they say? Would it be the same team? Whereas really truly the value creation in our life and work. Think about that. Restart when you're doing your goal setting rather than just thinking about incrementing yourself into the next thing you work on. Now, I'm going to give you some more tools to unpack this, but I wanted to start there because a lot of the work that we do, and it's a lot of the effort that we put into the work that we do ends up being through inertia, and I hate this quote with Edison talking about failure. You know, 10,000 ways that it didn't work, but the truth of the matter is that when, when we make effort and we are feeling like we're having a setback or re humiliated from that effort, the the truth of the matter is that the people who are continuing to have impact continue to do that and learn from that experience rather than allow themselves to be weighed under the pressures of it, that that whenever he gets criticized, he thinks about the experience he has like this virgin, we have more experience in our, Our name would suggest that it's about iteration.

Speaker 1:          11:00          It's about the capacity to be able to fail and move on this. That's the second principle that we learned from this group of high achievers like yourself was that is there anyone in this room has, who's ever wanted to do something important in their life or work where others didn't approve of them? Of course, we've all had or continue to have constantly what we call the silent scream. What is it in your life or work that others who love you, want to protect, you are trying to suppress or would hope that you'd make something of yourself so that you take another path in your life and work. This ends up being a very common pattern for all of us, and usually we tolerate it. In fact, we ended up fueling it because we do the second piece of the silent scream. The first piece ends up being, we're allowing others to perhaps deny that part of our life that we care about.

Speaker 1:          11:50          And then secondly, we will often hide that passion. Well, that's kind of our secret. It's what we don't want other people to trash because it's something that we love and something that we treasure. And then the irony of all this is that quite frankly, people who love you can see right through the ceiling like silent scream, right? The truth of the matter is it oozes out around all the edges that when we do coaching with high achievers like yourself, we find all the time that there's that silent scream that's worth being aware of. It's worth trying to build a plan of safety around that silent scream. We're going to talk more about how to develop a safe way to pursue your silent scream, but here's a glimpse at how we found this cohort around the world. In 110 nations started to deal with this. We didn't find any person who is doing something extraordinarily well, who didn't have a portfolio passions.

Speaker 1:          12:44          There isn't just one thing to do with our lives that usually there was a main expertise that was driven by an obsession, but there was always a portfolio of passions, other parts of that silent scream that you tap that feeds you, that restore you, that allow you to recover, that allow you to become resilient, that allow you to in a sense create a more rich and full life that matters. There's an obsession, I think now with expertise and being very precise about just what one area that we focus on and what we found is that people who've had endearing lives of creativity and contribution have a silent scream that contributes to a portfolio of passions and it's about, it's about putting a spotlight on what those are for you and your life. The third area that I found a bit ironic is that that people who are high achieving have a paradoxical pumpkin combination of both Hubris and humility and other was Hubris.

Speaker 1:          13:37          You have to have people like my friend Gail Devers, she went to four Olympics. Now, this woman on the fourth Olympic got a gold medal and she lamented the fact that she hadn't broken the world record said seriously gale, I mean four Olympics. And what we found was that on the one hand, she has this enormous Hubris to believe that she can do so well at something and the humility to realize that I always want to get better and that nothing that I achieved can't be done without. And through the efforts of others, that it's a combination of Hubris and humility that drives people to have high impact. Uh, we talked to Sally fields early on in the interviews that we were doing. She's one of the few women who've worked for 40 years on stage and screen Emmy and an academy award winning actress started out in meaningless roles, ended up doing very meaningful high contribution work. Listen to how she describes her journey.

Speaker 3:          14:31          The only thing that you have power over is to get good at what you do. That's all there is. That's all there is. There ain't no more. And the only time, the only way you become a leader or any such, you know, highfalutin terminology, a role model and leader, uh, you know, give back is to have something to give back. You see, the only reason, the only way you have something to give back, it's go do something, get off your rear end and go do something. And that doesn't mean I'm going to go, you know, build a housing for the underprivileged. That's good too. But go become a doctor, a lawyer, an Indian chief goal and worked your tail off and achieve something for yourself. Some specific thing, but be excellent at what that is. That's the only way that you can be a leader who wakes up one day and says, hmm, should I go to school or shall I be a leader? Let's see, what shall I do today? I think I'm going to go out and lead it. It's a non thing as a non thing that happens by accident after you've pursued and struggled and kicked yourself around the block 400 gazillion times and one day you look at and you say, okay, I've done that. I've done that and people are turning to you and saying, lead us. You know? Huh.

Speaker 1:          15:50          On more than one occasion, I was delighted to have been really put in my place when I ask questions like, so how did you find that leadership journey as a woman on Hollywood? And she said, are you nuts? That's not how we go about a journey that matters. It's not about you. It's about each of us individually finding that silent scream and reaching in and having the humility and the Hubris to make choices about moving towards that mission. And if it's ever not a struggle, then good for you. But what the people who are feeling, they're silent, scream, feeding them. And so being a very powerful combination of Hubris and humility. I think about, I met Steve Jobs in high school. I was a freshman, he was a senior. There was a summer at homestead high school where we met each other in a place, well, I shouldn't even tell you, but I was in the principal's office with him and I will tell you why we were there so long or had such an opportunity to bond.

Speaker 1:          16:46          But I will tell you that it was interesting to, to hear him talk about his dreams and at that time where I was in my life, all that was was frightening to me. To hear his hubris and his sense of ambition and creativity. There's no way I was going to chase him. This is not a story of me spending time in that garage and becoming a business building and there was no way I could possibly surrender at that point to the seduction of what he already had, which was clarity about that silent scream. Later, I would have the privilege of meeting him as Steve To oh, because I, at that point in my career, and by 1999 I was chairman of a company that invented this little thing. Um, anyone know what that is? Yeah. An MP. Three player. Right, exactly. Like what? I'm very proud of the fact that while other technology has all turned over in the last 25 years, nobody would think that was still be on your device.

Speaker 1:          17:37          But it's on pretty much everybody's device today. Still the MP three player, the audio is chairman of that. The little startup company and it was giving a speech at Stanford and Steve Jobs was going through his resurrection and he came up to the front. He said, mark, you're an idiot. This is a geeky piece of crap and we're going to crush it in about two years. You want to come work for me? What a recruiting this is. This was Steve to Datto. Don't let that attitude ever be an excuse to, I don't know how many leaders tell me, well Steve behaved that way. I said, well there's an outlier once we disrupt for different industries and maybe we have the privilege of being that kind of personality. But even he had started to recognize that it wasn't about him anymore. He was going to have to recruit a players from so many different fields and it was always about staying hungry and staying foolish enough that this time he wasn't going to lose this as company again.

Speaker 1:          18:28          But it's interesting to see, and I say this with the grace and love respect cause because I had an opportunity to work with him over a three year period, he, he'd come a lot, a long way as a leader. But when you think about what was it just last week, apple became the most valuable company in the world, broke uh, $1 trillion. They had already been the most valuable company in the world, but it wasn't until 2011 in his passing that the company went on to become the most valuable in the world. And it was interesting how he is transformation certainly contributed to the inertia in that company, but he didn't turn all of his wounds into wisdom. This guy did chuck Schwab being fiercely independent, having this Hubris, but then also being set by back by dyslexia. When I met him, he talked about how there was no way that he could have built a company if it hadn't been by finding people who had the strengths that he lacked.

Speaker 1:          19:20          And it turns out at Stanford Business School, he ended up being one of the people who most quickly scaled a business out of business school because he never thought he was the smartest guy in the room. He always chose to recruit a team around him that could do the things that he couldn't. He put his life's work, his silent scream, turned it into passions, and then instantly recruited a team to that dream who else could contribute to that dream and those sets of passions in ways that they owned and ways that they could make a unique contribution of their own independent impact. Listen to how chuck talks about this. This is another piece of archival.

Speaker 4:          19:56          How'd you go about coping when you were, you went on to college and, and started your career? How did it all through college? I got to call eyes by the, uh, you know, uh, by a lot of luck and uh, sometimes I think even mirrors, uh, because I flunked English a a couple of times at Stanford and a, it was a very debilitating, depressing thing for me to do that cause I was thought it was pretty bright and I didn't realize how incompetent I was in the skill of writing. In some respects. The positive side of this learning issue thing was probably my early recognition that I wasn't strong in every, every component of, uh, of, you know, reading, writing, all those kinds of things that I needed to have other people who could help me out in different parts of the business that it was developing.

Speaker 4:          20:49          A lot of people who are brilliant, we'll say, and who are brilliant entrepreneurs, think they can do everything and they don't develop the team that they need to have in order to accomplish that various levels that you're going to reach in your growth curve as a successful company. And so at every level this Schwab has moved to. I've been able to, I think, recognize my strengths and my deficits and build up around me with great people in the deficit area. And I think that probably has been maybe the one single most important benefit that I achieved or received from uh, having this learning issue early on in my life. Uh, so it's a little perverse in some respects, but at least that's the way I rationalize it.

Speaker 1:          21:34          Best bosses I ever had spent 12 years working at his side, really informed the way I decide now. Whenever I think about what I want to do next, I always think about who don't. Just think what think, who. Think about the community of people who might share that value, might be able to contribute to it in ways that would be profound for them as well in their own unique characteristics. This works as well in organizations as it does with your individual passions. Always recruit a team to that dream that you have. And he did this in a such a beautiful way and with dyslexia. Now, here's one of the leaders who was really changing the way we think about learning. He's got a wonderful foundation called all kinds of mines, finding geniuses everywhere with every type of learning that's out there. I suffered a disability early in my life.

Speaker 1:          22:24          An eyesight disability would read it profoundly difficult for me to read even up until middle school. So whenever I'm introduced as a New York Times bestselling author, author, I always kind of go, you're talking about me, David. Um, because that was always my struggle. I could tell stories as well. But that eyesight issue made it difficult with motor skills and certain cognitive processes until I got through adolescence and I, and it was one of the things that called me to the work that I do today in terms of executive coaching, because I always felt that everyone had their own form of genius, that maybe there are a and B players. But truthfully, it's more about a alignment, finding the things that we were profoundly gifted at and be able to contribute that with other people around us. Turning your wounds into wisdom. Principle number five, that's important.

Speaker 1:          23:08          And I'd love for you to, to ask yourself this question if you could today, the people who have life life's filled with happiness and joy, people who have lives that are filled with meaning take a moment each day or each week and shine a spotlight on who and what in their life and work is working. And one of the takeaways I'd love for you to do when you leave here today is to think of somebody to think I've got Karen May hear people development at Google who's encouraged me to do this work and and encouraged me to go around the world with Googlers to think about this. I have, David is a dear friend now who's developed these last couple of years. You'll be getting a note. I still have every note that Chuck Schwab and Steve Jobs ever wrote me. I'll never throw that away. Just think about the last night that you wrote to somebody, right?

Speaker 1:          23:54          One, send that email. It doesn't take that much effort to thank someone and it makes a profound difference and cognitively and emotionally and how it touches you. Some people call that gratitude, but that sounds Corny to me. I'm really talking about who and what works in your life. It was really a Richard Branson who's, who's continued to support this work for my coauthor Bonita Thompson and my daughter who's kind of a half Gugler. Uh, the, the work that she did at an internship here at 18 changed her life. I want to thank you guys at Google for having such a profound impact on my daughter because she's now a stem major. She went from being a political science major, which she was planning to go to school and she's now Berkeley math and she's pursuing a Haas a degree next. So thank you for the contribution you made to her life.

Speaker 1:          24:39          See how good that feels to be able to say something like that. The, the principle of having a place that's safe to tinker came up over and over again. It all 110 nations, no matter who we talked to as achievers, there was always a safe place for a garage. And I called this in a garage because if you think about silicon valley were filled with garages, which don't have cars. I don't know about you, but when I was growing up, I never visited a garage that had a car in it. What would you, what would you put a car? Unless you're inventing a car, why would you put a car in a garage? This was a safe place to tinker and create a new dream or build something or do that craft project. And you know, if it wasn't good enough to show the world, nobody can get to know.

Speaker 1:          25:19          It wasn't good enough to leave the garage. It didn't leave the garage. And so what's interesting in organizations and in, in the businesses that I've helped build and in the lives that I've helped support, you need a place to tinker. Where's your garage? It's amazing. Just across the bay at Pixar, I work with Jim Morris over there. It's amazing to see how they have safe places to tinker on massively expensive creative projects like films at Pixar is, you know, if you read Ed Catmull's book, I think one of the very best leadership books around and thinking about creating a life that matters is to read creativity inc because he talks about that place where you brainstorm and it's completely safe. This is a brainstorming room and you never criticize anybody eyes, anybody's ideas in that brainstorming room, you plus it up, you add to it. If you're going to be critical, you're out of there.

Speaker 1:          26:03          You've got to be able to build on pylon in a new way. So where is your community of or your mastermind for the dream that you want to follow? Is there a safe place to do that and have people come and pile on ideas and then it, at least at Pixar, they realize they have to run a business. So then they take it to another room to say, okay, now we're going to deconstruct the crime here. Set priorities, which are, that's miserable. I hate setting priorities. You know, no entrepreneur wants to decide which goes in which stays and what's done now and what's done next. And then they have a third room where they operationalize things. That's the business school that has to be practiced in order to run a business. So try to think about a sense of place. We're all as humans, the environment does when we do this at Google in terms of having creative spaces.

Speaker 1:          26:47          But remember, if you can have a place that you designate that's safe to create, safe to incubate, and safe to deliver, that's really important. We've found it coming up over and over again. Another principle that we found in, in this cohort of the high achievers was that they, like we talked earlier about the silent scream. Anyone here have a secret fear that they've run across? We all have different phobias and fears that we've had to face. Um, can I give you a stupid one for me? Uh, and I guess it's pretty safe to, to tell this crowd about just being, having a, a fear of heights and roller coasters. I still, even to this day, never been on a rollercoaster and not have any consequences at least, and this was hard when I became a daddy, because I would walk my daughter to the matter horn at Disney and I hear the screams of delight and I heard her screams of the light.

Speaker 1:          27:35          She, she looked like this little one here and we'd walk closer and closer, the melting down pat feeling my hands getting sweaty and, and by the time we got just up to deliver her and put her on the ride, I'd say, Daddy's got to take a call. Mommy's gonna ride with you. And that's what we do every time. You know, it was just like she saw it through that. She shot through that very quickly. Well, one of the things that I'm embarrassed to say that I didn't really discover it until this year and understanding in this data that I've been collecting for 20 years, and it was around this idea that often people who are high achievers, they may or may not face a fear down, but they almost never think about it as being a potential source of joy. If we could prepare for it, what if there was some way that we could somehow prepare for this difficulty in our life in a way that there just might be some shred of joy that comes from it.

Speaker 1:          28:26          That might to be an unlocked for me and there ended up being one for me in this particular case. I decided that yes. Okay. I was going to be ambitious here. I was going to toughen up. I was going to face, my fear is going to take a group of, of my clients, uh, it was the founder of Pinterest, the CEO of of HP and the staff. We rented a zero g plane and we went up in the so called vomit comments and what they do is they rent 10 miles by 100 miles of the stratosphere and they do 15 parabolas and you know down you're doing three g's and up. You're doing well, zero g and I, it was some macho thing in me that said, oh, I just have to do this, you know, for, forget the roller coasters are the skydiving. I'm going to prepare for this now.

Speaker 1:          29:09          I'm 20 years older than everybody who's on the plane. So I trained rigorously for this. I started studying. Why is it that you get nauseous, mark? Why do you get Vertigo? It's interesting. I'd never leaned into my fear. I'd never studied how was, what do we know about people who have fear of heights? Why do I have this fear? How could I address this fear? I guess I could go to therapy, but then that was be just a cycle. I wasn't really coaching myself. I wasn't a very good student. So I s I deconstructed this fear. Now I'm not saying I conquered it. I don't think that's true. I think what you do is you actually manage it, but I never thought that I might harvest it. So I ended up going up in the vomit comet because you know, and I was thinking this all along, it was thinking about the roller coaster ride. I'm not going to be like Ryan was in that movie, but I was going to try to find a way to go into zero g. Well that was fun. I would do that every day of the week. Something that apps that was, that was doing something. I can't imagine anything more frightening than to deal with looking out into the stratosphere and looking from dark to light and plunging like that. I stayed on the course. I, I stayed very disciplined about what they asked me to do, but I never expected to enjoy it.

Speaker 2:          30:33          Okay.

Speaker 1:          30:33          What fears do we have in our life that are holding us back that there might be just the shred of an unlock that we are worthy of leaning into and learning more about? That's something I'd never thought I would explore for myself before and I, I would see it. I observed it and I've been hearing people tell me this for 20 years and never internalized it until this year or found a way to exercise it. You learn throughout life. I'm hitting my 60th birthday here and finding a new joy that I missed that last 60 years. Now I'm feeling greedy. What else have I missed about what makes life special and what makes life so rich and creative? And this is what is unique about this cohort of people that I've found who continued to reevaluate how to create a life that matters and look at success. So let's deconstruct that one level further here. In the final piece, I want to ask you folks, if a loved one came to you not knowing anything about what you do for a living but their loved ones, it could be a child or a parent and asked you, what's your definition of success? What would, what would you tell them? Just at the highest level, what would be your definition of success? Anyone here? There's no right answer

Speaker 1:          31:45          anyway. David, what would be your definition of success?

Speaker 2:          31:53          I Love, love me and are better human beings because of that.

Speaker 1:          31:57          Is that a lovely definition of success? Give him a round of applause. That's beautiful. That's beautiful. That the community that I care about is better off because we're together and that you contributed to that community. Anyone else? What would be another definition of success? Yes.

Speaker 2:          32:18          Fulfillment

Speaker 1:          32:20          and being able to do some of those passions that maybe we talked about. Maybe if you were a silent screams, give him a round of applause. That's a great definition that you could find another part of your life that you yes. Happiness. What a concept that to come with success and that we'd be dividends of both of these others. That's a great to give her a round of applause. Success. Any other definitions of success?

Speaker 3:          32:45          Okay.

Speaker 1:          32:46          Anything else that comes to mind? She dropped. She, she was doing her hair back there. So you won the bid. What would be your definition?

Speaker 3:          32:53          Um, well it's not my definition, but a definition associated with pain.

Speaker 1:          33:01          Yes, exactly. So this is an interesting point that will make, so if you looked up the definition of success in the dictionary, which actually didn't occur to me to do 20 years ago when we started the research, but our warden team said like, if you could, we're going to publish this book with Prentice Hall. You know, we got to do the research, look in the dictionary. That was the definition in the dictionary. But that's it. The definition that we heard from people who had high impact in their lives and had developed lives that truly matter for them and others didn't have wealth, fame or goals actually on the list. So what we teach our kids or feel conflicted about, one of the reasons the silent screen is so profound is because we have a double standard on how we define success in every language. By the way, if you can find another one, I'll send you a nice bonus.

Speaker 1:          33:53          If you can find a way that deaf, the definition of success is to find anywhere else. It's, it's a punishing evil definition of success, frankly, because it's not how successful people who've had lives that matter long periods of time define success. In fact, the definition of success, I shouldn't be surprised. And I hear this, a Google, wherever I go in the world and I'm now asking people live in, in meetings like this, 10 15,000 people, they define success, the success, the same way that you did in this room. And it ends up being characterized this way. And the and, and the thing I want to say about this is also for you to notice. You should never assume that you know somebody's definition of success. There's more than one definition. I'm not sure that your definition of success might have been the same even five years ago.

Speaker 1:          34:38          The check in to find out what a person's definition of success is. You might be profoundly touched by how they frame it. If knowing that about David or knowing that about how you sense this connection with your passions makes a difference in your relationship with that person. How they define that success. There's not just waited one to do it. What we found was that there's three categories of the definition of success. All three of these were present in everyone who'd had impact for 20 years or more. They had a sense of a purpose or a cause, something that they were associated with that was greater than themselves, but that they believed in, that they cared about. They had a sense of passions and connection. They had a sense of the who they wanted to be with through their purpose, but also through their hobbyists and through their passions and through the work that they wanted to do.

Speaker 1:          35:25          And then they also had a a way of actually wanting to deliver on the goods. I mean it's one thing to be purpose driven, but it's hard to really earn the right to do that unless you can deliver on some of your promises that if this what we'd call the genius of the end rather than material, any of the your that that when you're feeling out of balance, it's not just because you can't do enough of the one thing that you love. It's because we're often not doing things that we can see connected to something bigger than us or a community bigger than us. And that also feeds our passions. The passions are about things that we would do on our own. They're not about winning. There are about doing something we believe in that we want to refine this. Something that we want to be a part of performance has to do with our ability to deliver on those things.

Speaker 1:          36:08          And, and what I'd love to do right now is just serve you a set of definitions around passion. So you can mind this a little deeper. So what we found is that there are really six dimensions of passion. And the reason I have my Angela and Warren Buffet up here is because when I went to visit Maya Angelo, she talked about how most of us don't live our lives, feelings, all three of these, that it's easy to maybe focus on one but not the other two. That wouldn't, we're feeling out of balance. It's because we haven't decided, wait, okay, so how is this connected to something bigger than me or longer term? Some people might even call this a legacy and you know, could this could be a community, it could, it doesn't have to. It could be a company, it could be a customer, just something bigger than ourselves.

Speaker 1:          36:47          Passions are for you. Performance is how we deliver an express. All of those. So let's go through purpose, passion, and performance. But one thing about Warren Buffet, Warren Buffet won't accept a job inquiry from an individual unless they qualify for all three of these. He says, a lot of people will have a sense of how they've served to a business or a purpose in the past. They'll express maybe how they've delivered in terms of performance, but when it comes to passion, most people put that off and don't integrate that in with their work. That that passion is not something you should put off to another time and needs to be a part of your everyday work. He said that that passion to put off your passions is a little bit like saving up sex for old age. It's a really bad idea. We should be living full out right now.

Speaker 1:          37:33          And I said, good for you wore and I want to be that way. When I made a right, the oracle of Omaha says that we should be living full out and so should the Po, the Po. So there's the Poe, the poet, and she expresses her life. So let's look quickly at passion. Passion. We found this portfolio. Passions. We talked about, you can, you can look at this set of passions in the sense that one of the ways to evaluate whether you're doing something you're passionate about is that you will lose sense of time. Mikael, Chez Mal, Holly, the social scientist would call experts in their field where they, the were artists are chemists and say, how long have you been working on the project? Don't look at a watch. They could never say your unconscious competence. You will lose that when you're in the flow, ever been in the flow.

Speaker 1:          38:17          You're doing something else and it starts to contribute to answering the question. As soon as you let go of the problem you're running, you're reading, you're doing your favorite knitting, then it starts to flow for you. So think when you watch the flow, that's usually an indication of passion. We tend to have a bias when it comes to defining failure. Generally, when you're doing something you're passionate about, it's not a failure. It's a learning. We redefine it. I used to run and play music in high school. I don't run anymore because I wasn't that good at it. So I failed at that, but I'm still playing the horn even though I wasn't that good at it. But I'm learning, I'm getting better and better. Um, I, I'm still trying to be creative that way. We tend to be proactive and do the things we're passionate about first.

Speaker 1:          38:59          We like to think we're objective, but we have decision by us. The things that get at the top of the list are generally the ones that we feel the most passionate about. I'm thinking over this because I'm not a behavioral psychologist. I really wanted to look at how the behavioral data, what we did a forced ranking and we asked people in this conjoint analysis to determine what they really cared about this is these were the dimensions of passion. That passion is something you'd secretly do for free. Now I know we're at Google is a business, but we're all hopefully driven not just by the clock, right? We are driven with doing something some aspect of the day. I mean life is short, but some days are very long, right? Not Everything we do is something we love and it's not what I'm really proselytizing hear. What I'm saying is that there needs to be some aspect of the work we do that feeds us even with out traditional compensation.

Speaker 1:          39:47          You bore people when you're passionate, so you go to a party and you know somebody asks me about my daughter, please don't make this mistake. I will not shut up. You'll be looking at me saying, I'm so happy for you, mark, and they're looking at their watch. They feel the aging process. They don't know how to get out of the conversation. Mark is still geeking over it. You're not politically correct or socially conscious entirely when you're in a state of passion, when you're, when you're living your passion. Now, this is an important way to deconstruct relationships because it's good to know what's flipping. Somebody switched so that you can either feed that for them or help align them with that on a project or help associate with them. If you share that passion, this is another dimension of it. You definitely bore people when you're passionate about something and it's also something that you would hope that in history that you'd like to be remembered for.

Speaker 1:          40:36          It usually is the kind of thing that I, Gosh, I'd love to say that the passions that I've been living in, the purpose I'm feeling could somehow be remembered that somehow would be a part of my legacy that could somehow maybe make a difference. Um, and it would be make a life worth living. I do some that do spend some considerable time up at Nike. And what's the slogan at Nike that's most famous, which you'll have to have a slogan like that. Everybody in any language, it always comes back, just do it in English. Why is that so compelling? Kind of cuts through the clutter and the bullshit of our lives and the pressure and the denial that comes from other people about what we really want to do. We just want to do it, but we don't want to just do anything. I want to do something that matters.

Speaker 1:          41:25          I love the current positioning that they have right now. They talk about trying to find your inner athlete, whether you are an athlete or not, and to play, to be remembered. I think what we'd all to feel is that somehow the impact and the, and the creativity and the meaning that we found in our life would mean that we had played in to be remembered that we were writing our own future. That that would be perhaps the most profound way to think about our lives. Um, I'd like it all just stand up for a moment. I asked you the definition of success and I just want to make a closing request of you all and then we'll do some Q. And. A. I asked you a moment ago your definition of success and you were processing this and hoping I wasn't going to call on you.

Speaker 1:          42:11          And as you were doing that, I'd like to now invite you to think about the fact that the success that you've achieved is not entirely yours. It's also because there's a contribution from others, that there's other people in your life and your work that have helped make you successful. Isn't that right? It's not just about you. So could you try to picture in your mind for a moment, someone in your life or work who's somehow contributing to the success that you've enjoyed in your life? Can you, can you get that picture in your mind? If that person was trying somehow to get through Google security and is now being arrested at the front door, do you think you could make a noise so loud to alert them all that they should let him, he or she in, do you think you could make a noise so loud in this room that you could indicate how much you love this person? One, two, three. I'm then on the count of three, you're going to give me a noise so loud that you're going to have them released from security. One, two, three go.

Speaker 1:          43:08          Okay, very nice. Please sit down. That's great. That's great. They're letting them through now. Could you check on that? Yeah. I wish I'd had somebody there at this morning when I was trying to get in. Um, the reason I did that is because there's so few times in our life and work that we really show that level of gratitude to the people that mean the most to us. Would you promise me one thing that when you leave here today that you could let those few people who qualified for you at that mental list of success know that you gave them a shout out today? As corny as that may be, that that'll, that'll make your day better. That'll make you feel profoundly better. And it's what the most creative high impact people do. Thank you so much. I'd love to take questions. Thank you.

Speaker 2:          43:54          Hi Mark. Thanks. Sure. Yeah. There's the three p's and I feel like certain ones come easier to me than others and damn straight. Yeah. So like getting stuff done or performance. Yeah, sure. Yeah. Um, does the passion and then there's the purpose. A purpose one. Yeah. I can serve through it. That's not natural. How does it get to come to you? Is it really a thought process or it's like really centering. It comes from the heart. The, have you heard of people struggling with that?

Speaker 1:          44:28          Yes, absolutely. And I think we have reaffirm kind of what we believe in and reevaluate that probably at many different points in our life and in our career. But what we found is that the process that, that, that many people go through is to try to, to, to get a sense of what their purpose might be by looking at their career over time and seeing what are the proudest moments that you have in your personal life. What were the proudest moments that you have? What were the ones that give you the most energy on reflection? Lay it out in a timeline. Um, and one of the ways that you can observe that list is to start to deconstruct would be the three or five reasons in terms of purpose of that work that you were doing. Frame it that way that it gave you that response.

Speaker 1:          45:12          Let's start with what gives you a sense of pride. Now I'm grossly oversimplifying a much deeper process that we can talk about, but the idea is to say that are those areas of your life that you're the proudest about kind of feeding a sense of purpose in any way. They may also be feeding a sense of passion and some of the things that you'd just like to do for your own sake. And it helps separate it from a moment from achievement because usually when you answer those questions of proud of most moments, you've probably already tick the box for performance. We're especially in Western society, very much trained towards outcomes and achievement and we are programmed for that. That's part of the silent scream. If there's something that we love that's not achievement oriented, that's probably in the silent scream category. It's one of those hard, hard things to resurrect into your active portfolio passions that you have.

Speaker 5:          46:00          It's very easy to define success. Looking back, so like, uh, I don't know, like if laddie started out with the mission of organizing the world's information, I was like a book. It started out with you know, organizing with lake kind of run the world vision is history of the past, right? Yeah, so looking forward like how do you define your mission or lake? How do you know what you are passionate about? Because honestly I don't know what I'm passionate about at this point.

Speaker 1:          46:25          You know it's because of a lot of inertia that we often lose track of what we feel that are most most passionate about. Which is why I would love to, I'll I can send to you and you'll also find in the book or if he didn't get a copy of the book we can send that to you. I'd be happy to send that free the criteria around passion because you can explore some of those areas that speak to use those areas that you find that you are talking about a little bit too long with a loved one. The the category of areas where you find yourself spending time when you're not working. Is there something you're naturally being gravitated to? What? What are those areas that you are not putting a spotlight on now because they're not achievement oriented or outcome oriented. Is there anything that you particularly look forward to in the work that you're doing right now?

Speaker 1:          47:08          What aspect of it do you hate? What aspect do you love about that? I often go through a process where it's more interesting to look at what you hate and see why you hate it and you think that's a really dumb idea. Why would we look at the things that we consider a failure and hate the most? Because what's shocking is if you share that with three other people, they may not agree you as being, that's the worst thing that ever happened to them. What's so shocking in the work that I do among high achievers is that I'll just assume that the things that people love or this and the things that they hate her, that, and I'm wrong every single time that a person might say, gosh, well what I hate about this is that, that, uh, nobody knows that I did the work and I'm not getting recognition.

Speaker 1:          47:49          And, and uh, so I don't feel significant here unless I have a speaking part. And the next person over who's a high achiever will say, what I hate most about this is I have to get up every time and speak about this. I can't stand being in front of a crowd. So to deconstruct what it is that's that you hate so much, and I call this kind of ballast the things that are, if you were to look at the high points in your life, the proudest moments and the worst moments in your life, and just spend an extra moment looking at why you hate the things you hate. There's probably, uh, if you flip that into energy, if you flip that into why it's holding you down, you'll get the insight into something that could be really miraculous in your life. So my, my wife, who is my coauthor on all of this work, uh, her brother died when he was 21, he was already taking, he was already bicycling over to NASA savant a genius.

Speaker 1:          48:40          And you might ask three people, obviously the loss of a brother when you're 18, and he's 21 particularly would be so profoundly impacting your life. And you'll almost find as many reasons in this room why that's a bad thing as there are people in this room. But for her, the greatest loss was the lack of contribution that he would have. The rural lost a genius. That's probably not the first thing. The next three people would say. So what did that do to inform what she cherishes and believes that I'm going to spend my life? I realized that's what I care about. I'm projecting it on all the other important people in my life. So she spends her life trying to create a life that matters for others. For me, I was held back because of a developmental disability. I never know a suit, a person's intelligence or capacity until we actually worked together to try to unlock what that is because everybody has a certain form of genius and the most key part of innovation is to try to unlock that particular genius. I have endless patients for that because if I didn't, I wouldn't believe in myself. It's a, it's a personal projection of that passion. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          49:47          Thank you for this affair. An inspirational talk. Um, so the common definition of success is a bit money, fortune and fame, power and all that. And then I can tell if I'm going to talk like you and your friends probably enjoyed a lot of that. My meanwhile, we're all losers. We're just, yeah. By meanwhile, do you agree that I'm in [inaudible] people just don't have those majority by just common people. Yes. You know, my sound was it goes to homestead high and I tried to east by him, Hey, look at this Steve Job, Great Java. He said, dad, he was just an exception. I'm a normal kid. Yes, that makes sense. So it's a fair, it's a fair point, right? Yeah. Do you think not fall common people he saw seen point of the fan debt sacked Sachi and can pan farm from just doing normal things just be 10, 10. We see. Why don't we, we got absolutely just for a paying job at Google. That's what happened. Yeah. Yeah. You're definitely a very normal underprivileged Gugler because

Speaker 1:          50:51          do you know they're just, that sets the bar a certain place that is maybe a little also privileged. Um, the point of all this, it really is that it's for each and every one of us to find their, our purpose, our passion and performance. The only reason I used to famous examples is because you know them. And because I was shocked at how inadequate each and every one of them were to the task that they were faced with. And yes, maybe they're the long tail or the Unicorn, but each and every one of us or a unicorn that that that really we should be looking at. The standard that we're setting the standard that you're setting at Google from your son is that he lived a life that matters to him. Nobody else can make that decision for him. And that's the silent scream. So your job is to say not to talk about Steve Jobs because he's actually a terrible role model, is to talk about what's so special about him that he lays up at night thinking about that.

Speaker 1:          51:46          He's afraid to talk to you about that you could empower. So he could be lighting up the sky with that work. It may not be politically correct. He may not become a doctor or a lawyer, but he might end up being the best creator. You might be the best inventor. What could you feed? Jane Goodall would lose the daughter at four eight she was four years old. She'd wander off and, and she'd looked for hours for a daughter and daughter would be found there. She was looking at the lizards and she was looking at the bugs. Well, that wasn't a politically correct profession in a family that had all doctors and lawyers and she became jade Goodall. So there's a, there's a, there's a shred of a place of, of joy and contribution and, and that's what we as parents are so challenged to. Yes.

Speaker 6:          52:30          Um, there was a quote earlier is something about, um, winners and losers and winners lose more than losers. Yeah. I was just wondering how would you justify your losers? It's, it's not a fair, I'm glad you pointed it out because I'd be supremely disappointed if I didn't get called on that. So thank you. Give her a big round of applause. So if there's any great exception, I think

Speaker 1:          52:53          by the way this is presented, you'd never talk about winners and losers. The reason I did that though is for a very specific reason, and that is that if you talk to people who, if you didn't know that they had had some celebrity or, or additional success, you'd find that they spent more airtime talking on their failures than their successes. That they were learning from iterating towards an outcome that they will, to seeking. The point I was really trying to make there is that we, we fail more often than we succeed if we're really trying hard at something we care about and that's okay. In fact, that's the only way to fail forward to success. Usually 10 times more losses than wins for people who were trying to do something meaningful. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          53:39          If you feel like you don't have a silent scream, is it better to a hope it comes organically, uh, be cultivate one that you want to have or see. Just kind of give up on the idea that you matter. It sounds like a standard Google bubble test. Isn't there a d all of the above or none of the above?

Speaker 1:          54:02          Um, the, this, it doesn't have to be so much a silent scream. I mean the good news might be do you enjoy your work

Speaker 6:          54:11          moderately, moderately. I enjoy everything moderately. So like there's not like a peak or a low.

Speaker 1:          54:17          Okay. So it's a matter of starting to notice whether there's peaks or Lowe's. It's starting to notice the things that really irritate you the most because there might be the germ of something you really care about there. So I have good friends who you know, are just offended if they see bad code. Um, I see. I have friends who are offended if they see a bad ad written. These are things are insights into maybe she should be spending some more time doing copywriting on ads. And that's not something you've ever been offered in your life most likely. It's so amazing to me being a late parent and having my daughter go to a grade school like Berkeley. But it's interesting asking the kids don't, what do you want to do and why do you keep changing your mind? It's because dad, we never got asked a choice.

Speaker 1:          54:58          We were never offered an opportunity to test new ideas out. Right. That's not what you're really allowed to do. Pass the AP test, right? Get the performance done. So things do end up getting kind of mediocre. Like I like everything kind of moderately well cause I did get A's in those classes. But you really haven't been offered this opportunity. Now to step back for a moment and look at the things that are your highs and your lows, you'll start to see some of them. And if you do some more reading about the passion test, you're going to find that some of those areas do activate you more than others. Some are, you're better at some of those. Speak to you more and that that might be a way to start to find a way to lean into those, those ideas. All right. Thank you everybody.

Speaker 6:          55:39          Appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you.
