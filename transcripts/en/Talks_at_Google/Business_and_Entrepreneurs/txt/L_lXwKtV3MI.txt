Speaker 2:          00:48          Cool.

Speaker 1:          00:49          We're really excited to have you here. Let me said he'll be here with you. Great. So, uh, the word networking sends a lot of chills or on people with downs, people's spines, including my own. And I might even dare to say there's other people in the room that would prefer to treat the word networking like an elephant in the room and maybe maybe keep it a enclosed corners. But without networking, your career would have never gotten to where you are today. And you talk about this a bit in the book, but would you mind sharing with us how this idea of networking and how it's creatively developed brought you from 2002 to where you are today?

Speaker 2:          01:21          Yeah, so my uh, my background is I'm an attorney. I practice law in Canada in an Inn New York City, made a career change, decided wanted to make a career change in 2002 and realize I didn't have the network to do it even though I was looking for a career within the same industry and everything synced. Ben has come about because of networks and relationships and purposely building strong connections. So is Abby mentioned, you know the word networking, put chills in their spine. It puts a chill in my spine too fast in the book. I am a reluctant networker. Um, I was also very reluctant in public speaking, so the universe does really have a way of coming back at you. When you think of networking is working a room, y'all think about, you can say the word networking. You'd probably imagining cocktail party, there's a name tag that you have to pin somewhere.

Speaker 2:          02:20          It probably balancing some sort of a drink, trying to talk to someone. Someone introduces you, you're pulling off, you know, some satay off a little stick. He goes the horrors, right? Like how are you talking about the weather or something? You're just like, ah, that is not networking. To me, that's a networking tactic. But networking to me when you think of it as an activity is every single human interaction. So when you think about your own lives, for me networking was your decision to be here today. You're networking is your email signature line. It's the headshot you all have on, you know, fabulous name tags are on social media. Um, it is, um, I dunno, maybe someone leave a voicemail message for someone else today. Did you hand out a business card? Did you, I dunno. Leaving on out of office responder that says you weren't going to be around to me every time we interact with someone else that is networking and, and those micro-actions in my mind or what are more effective in moving our careers.

Speaker 2:          03:31          And our ambitions and our relationships forward than relying on, you know, balancing a cocktail plate and handing out a business card and having something you know, smart to say at a cocktail party. So if networking is an activity I want you to think of was every human interaction and how can you do those better. Networking is a mindset. I want you to think about it as this is really hard for a lot of people. How can you be a decent human being? Because I think that's all we're ever looking for is how can we have someone who listens to us and is considerate and the networking as well. Where do you start when someone says something foolish to you, like do more networking cause he's offered that one. That's great. How do I start doing that is where are you headed? Where are you going?

Speaker 2:          04:22          What are you trying to achieve right now with the help of other people? And then who are the people who can help you or the people already in your network. Are they groups or organizations that you maybe think you need to join now? How can you communicate with them better? Because part of networking is our preference on how we communicate and engage and the other is the person you want to interact with. So I mentioned that. I said voicemail as as uh, I think it's an active networking. My voicemail message, if anyone calls me, says please don't leave me a voicemail message. I don't listen to them. The number of people who still leave me a voicemail messages is comical. And I can tell you what I do with every single one of them. Delete. I've stated my preference, text me or email me or tweet me, do not leave me a voicemail.

Speaker 2:          05:11          I don't listen to these. And they are with the Twitter handle again. So this is a pretty significant rebrand to the idea of networking and especially what we hear in business communities or in, uh, an MBA session or anything like that. Well, I always say we get so unamortized I to say, I think we've become so unnevered with technology and ways things can do things faster. We don't have to pull out a paper map anymore, you know, thankfully who can get us our directions. We can click and swipe and tab. But we need to remember behind all of this is human beings and we have messy, complicated, you know, unusual lives. And on any given day, you know, we can, you know, be in a good mood or bad mood or you know, have some trigger that sets us off. And your reaction to something might be different than my reaction to something. And so I think, you know, if nothing else from this book and people put people, put people back in the center of your networking and think, how can I be someone other people want to network with? How can I be the person I want to network with? And just add that little consideration into your daily activities and will make all the world of difference. So digging in

Speaker 1:          06:29          a little bit, one of the themes that Kelly talks about in her book is the give, give, get theory. And while it might seem a little bit self explanatory, it would love to hear your thoughts on how you came to it. When we're thinking about putting people back in networking people back and relationship building.

Speaker 2:          06:44          Well let me see the, the, the gift. I mean it's great to be talking about it here. You know, that Google and in the heart of Silicon Valley that where there is often been and has been built on this give, give, get mentality and that, but that is sort of one of those old rules of networking. I think there's an element of, of resurrecting ms manners or Craig Claiborne and wrapping them around our networking activities. Again. Uh, and the idea is this is, you know, have you been a good person in the community within your awkward, within your, with, within which you are operating. Have you been that colleague who has been helpful to other people? Kathryn Finney who is interview the book is very case study driven. Kathryn Finney, one of the interviewees, and she's has the big accelerator out of uh, Atlanta as she says, you know, if you, if you can't call upon a network, you probably have a low return on generosity and then you need to look at what your own interactions are.

Speaker 2:          07:45          I think that idea of the give, give, get though is hard for some people because there's often a networking imbalance. You know, you're looking to network with someone who was higher up a corporate ladder or someone who apparently has more resources, connections, then you do. And that's where I come back to what I said before about being a decent human being. Um, are you considerate of somebody else's time when you're asking them for advice? Do you follow up and let them know what you did with that advice? Have you done enough research so that if you're taking someone's time to ask them the question, you're asking them right question the right question. If they've already written it on a blog, if they shared it on a youtube video, if they have posted an endlessly, why would you ask a question that you could find the answer to when a Google search, you could do that work, read it all, take it all in and then ask them a better question.

Speaker 2:          08:43          In my mind that is networking, generosity and that is an essential give. I think in this day and age before you ask for you know, time, you know we have two resources in life, really time and reputation. One, you can maybe earn back your reputation, you can never get back your own time and you can never give back anybody else's time. So really that, that essential given networking for me is like doing your homework before you make that, that asks to maximize that time and maximize the, the, the giving of the other person instead of wisdom and, and realize that that level of consideration is enough of a, of a, of a gift. Because like I said, people like, oh my God, if I ask someone for you know, an introduction, what am I going to give them? You don't need to give them an equal introduction.

Speaker 2:          09:33          You may never have that opportunity and they may never want it. But you can give them consideration. You can give them that kindness, you can give them that thoughtfulness and that, I mean it sounds like a really low base level, but the number of people who, who sort of like this is all we need. Uh, one of the other people interviewed in the book is Alison Levine. Ellison is, and how many friends do you get to see in life or an adventurer? And she's a best selling author, but she's also an adventure. She has led the first all us women's team up Everest amongst other accomplishments in mountains, literally that she has climbed. And when I asked her about, you know, networking, generosity, what was the give, because of course she's accomplished so much. People ask her for so much and she just said, you know what, just be considerate.

Speaker 2:          10:26          Be considerate about the time that you're asking for. Get be considered about what you're asking for. Don't ask me if I've climbed Everest, you know, Google search will reveal that. And she was so adamant on this, I had to call her and say, Allie, I need to edit your answers for my book because if I kept her original answers, the book would come in a brown paper wrapper with a parental warning. A lot of all caps, lot of imaginative words. Uh, it's, it, it sounds crazy, but like just that little consideration, it makes all the difference.

Speaker 1:          10:57          So Alison was actually at Google last week and now you're making me, I'm going to watch her talk when it was recording. She sounds, it sounds fantastic.

Speaker 2:          11:05          Like seriously, if you missed her person, watch her talk. Alison Levine is extraordinary. Okay,

Speaker 1:          11:12          fantastic. So on that idea of frequent networking asks that we might get or questions that might come in often, especially for someone like you who identifies as a connector, uh, one of the ideas I wanted to run through by Kelly was to self assess and look at some of the networking emails I've sent or I've received with leading questions. And I want to read these out cause I think these are often networking crutches that we land on. I want to pick your brain about something. Talk to the hand on that one. Don't send that email and we'll break it down and break some of these down afterwards. But if you think of anyone for this, nope. Nope. Oh, do you have any opportunities in mind for me to grow? You mean you don't know everything about my personal and professional development? Uh, do you know anyone that might want to cover this story or give me some publicity?

Speaker 3:          12:10          The number of that last one, the number of times I get that from, from emerging tech companies who hired PR firms and that's what they email me. Oh, for the love of God.

Speaker 1:          12:19          So as someone who's relatively young in their career and when I'm thinking about networking horizontal or networking vertically, and I'm talking to folks that I know I want to make the most value their time, but I also don't want to overstep. I don't want to come off as a asking too much. So sometimes it can feel more comfortable to go back to these general statements.

Speaker 3:          12:40          Questions are asking too much. Think about an email you get from a friend that says, I'm looking for a job. How does that feel when you get that? You're like, I don't know where to start. Yeah, so what do you have to start by doing? You have to start by asking a lot of questions and we're racking your brain. Well, did you want a job at Google or where you were looking for a job at Walmart? I don't know. Like what are you looking for? And when you ask big general questions, you're making your network do the work for you rather than giving them that target. Think about like darks. You gotta, you know like you've got a target that you're going for. Tell them what your bullseye eye is because then we have a radius of ways to help you. So if you said, hey, I'm looking for a job at x and you're like, I don't know anyone at x, but I know someone at why I don't know anyone at NBC, but I know someone at ABC, would you want to talk to them?

Speaker 3:          13:36          We have something to aim at. But if you said, I'm just looking for a new job, I don't know what to shoot for and now you put the work on me and that is too heavy of an ask. I think our networks have been extraordinarily strained when I think of it from a, probably about 2009. When you think the economic collapse and uh, you know, Lehman brothers, all of that stuff going on in people's strained and looking for opportunities. I think our networks are strained because our nature of work has changed. So many of us do freelance or we're looking to get opportunities and experiences with, with within one company and then we're moving to another. So we're constantly moving in and out of opportunities and networks. So you're better off and you're, you're helping your network, you're helping yourself and you're helping you get a better answer if you're specific and people are afraid of going specific and, and, and, and maybe they're afraid of doing the work, but there are a lot of people say to me, but if I do all that research and ask the question, I have to do a lot of work.

Speaker 3:          14:40          And I'm like, yeah, that's a point. That's why it's network. So that work word in it, but it's also, you know, if you get off on just sending 50 emails saying, Hey, I'm looking for a job, can you help me this time sitting around waiting for an answer as time, why not do the research? Find a smaller group of people within your network who can provide you with the right answer or closer to the right answer. Spend your spend your networking time on that front end doing that. Ask a better question. You don't need 50 people emailing you back. You need one or two and email you back with the right opportunity. I think so, yes to all of that. And to give a plug here, buck and build your dream network. You, one of the things that I loved about this focus that you talked about how to figure out what you're asking in the networking anyways, you should have a goal in mind.

Speaker 3:          15:30          And sometimes we know that this, this ambiguous networking concept is important, but we don't know why we need to be doing it. So, and that brings to random acts and networking. But when, when you think of what you started, like the bad name on networking. Like I, if I don't know why I'm in a networking room, I mean I'm equally sweaty palms and anxious as anyone else. I'm like, wait, why am I here? What am I going to talk about? But if I know why I'm there, if I've made a conscious decision to be there, it's a heck of a lot easier to kind of figure out. All right, what are we going to talk about? Um, what's, what's an introduction? We question that I would want to say to someone or if my networking is, I just need to discover what this group or organization or association is all about.

Speaker 3:          16:11          I'm happy to go and sit quietly and assess the landscape to understand, right? Do I want to spend more time here in the future? But that all should aligned back to the goals that you have set before even walking into the room. Otherwise you run around like with chicken, with your head cut off and listen, our time is, look, we have not been able to hack time, still only 24 hours looking on that. Know, maybe someone's working on it here, you know, uh, you know, we can just reverse this every once in a while. Um, um, met George Takei at a south by a few years ago and I said to her, I'm still mad with star trek. We don't have that, you know, beam me up Scotty technology, that would be good too. But so we don't have more time in the day. And for many of us, you know what work is important.

Speaker 3:          16:55          There's other things that are important and your network is also important for your community service. It may be important for other things in your life and frankly just having time to be with you know, other people that are close to you like make a priority for that. So you know, I'm very much about efficiency, you know, maybe it's women multitasking, how can you pack more into things we're already doing rather to add more things on when our time is limited. Great. Thank you. I would say for folks that are interested more in about goal setting and thinking about those, those metal levels of career development, I would highly recommend checking out the book. The chapters on goal setting helped me a lot personally with thinking about time at Google and it made some of those networking questions a little bit clear and some of the steps easier to just apply.

Speaker 3:          17:41          One of the early readers of my books called me up and said, I've got some bad news about your book. And I said, what's the bad news? And she's like, it's not about networking. And I'm like, yeah, I had, I had that suspicion, I had that suspicion. Uh, and I think it is a bigger look at what is it that you want to achieve and you achieve things with the help of other people. Now how can you form better relationships and how can you focus what you're doing so you can achieve it. So the case studies in the book range from working up the corporate ladder to crowdfunding to getting on a national board to, uh, I wouldn't say landing a job right out of college. Um, how Tina Roth Eisenberg created creative mornings. I've global network for the creative community. So it's, it's, it's more than just how you balance the and work room and it has gotten a few people thinking about Ra, where, what do I want to achieve with my career?

Speaker 3:          18:38          Um, what do I want to do after I retire? I have a friend's mom inspired to start her own business after she retires is a school teacher in June because she read the book. That's pretty cool. It's gonna be exciting to see where this book brings people over the years as well. Sure you're gonna be getting some fun emails or tweets and those, and those are the things that mattered to me. Like when I get those to think that, you know, something is unlocked, you know, something for someone else and now they can pursue a path to their own success. So in very gratifying in that. So I want to jump back to something you were talking about earlier around our us owning our relations are a part of the, our reputation and owning our time. And one thing that really stood out to me in the book was you kept bringing back this idea of who knows what you know, or the way I would rephrase it as what are you known for?

Speaker 3:          19:29          And I think my question for you right off the bat would be how do you know who knows what, you know, I mean, cause I put part of their, I see that is, is I think about how we've evolved, how the job market, um, and opportunities have evolved from who you know and all those insider networks, you know, to maybe what, you know, cause it was a world driven by help. Wanted and recruiters and classify ads to now a world that where I put it is, it's not who you know or what you know, but who knows what you know. Um, and I mentioned this in the book. I remember when I was researching and I pulled up something and it popped up. I know it was in Linkedin. It popped up an opportunity at Google. So I went and clicked on it and then it said, by the way, who do you know at Google one at you contact them?

Speaker 3:          20:21          And I'm like, yeah, what is the information you're sharing with your network in terms of what your interests are? Uh, you know, what maybe you want to do next? What in your life and your career that you want more of? Because the signals you send out, maybe you know, the stuff that starts coming to you as the opportunities that you're really seeking. So if you look at it, go and look at your own profiles. Go and look at the information that you're sharing, whether it's in person, online, or offline, uh, with your community. Because you may be sending out the wrong signals in terms of what you want to be found for. I know like my profile and you don't see anything about being a lawyer. It is so buried and so minimal with search words and everything else. Cause Lord knows I don't want to be contacted on that.

Speaker 3:          21:09          So when we're thinking about our email signatures or our Twitter headlines or even our bios on our internal job search boards, do you think that those should all be the same and we should have it, we should know what people are identifying us. Make, make sure it's powerfully moving forward. Your ambition, if you're posting things online, you know, what are the stories that you're sharing, if, if, you know, are you sharing, if you're sharing rich content that is dealing with your professional and your career interests in, or are you sharing in a way that people are identifying with something that you either are an expert in or you want to move into or something that you care about? Uh, we have that ability in mobility to move between things. I mean, my own personal story was, um, in 2011, 2012, I co founded a startup accelerator.

Speaker 3:          22:01          It was not my idea though. I was one of the cofounders, the original idea came from my two cofounders and they realized in launching this nutty, crazy idea that they needed somebody else to help them. And they kept talking to people and describing the skillset and the abilities that they were in the background. They were looking in this third cofounder, nameless, third cofounder and my name kept coming up. Everyone kept saying, you know what? He'd started to Kelly, you know, you should talk to, you should talk to Kelly. So what do you want to be known for? A network that, that experience network, that ambition, network, that skillset, but people know what you're interested in. Cause they may be like, oh, I know who you're looking for. You're looking for someone like Kelly, are you looking for someone like Abby, let me re you should talk to them.

Speaker 3:          22:49          Sounds like a great opportunity. And that's how everything in my life has happened really since 2009 for folks that are listening in right now and saying, that sounds great, I need to update my headline or my goodness, I don't know what people know me for right now. Do you have any take actions? And I want to say a quick win. They areas that people can take away today to start to change their headline changed, but they're known for. Right? Well, I mean the take, take an audit of every place where you're interacting with other people and say, you know, is this, is there's this consistency. Is this networking me forward in the way I want to be found? And then stop and think and say, all right, how is my network interacting with me? What are they asking me for? How are they engaging with me?

Speaker 3:          23:34          Now? How much of that is my network? Like, do I have the right mix of people in it in terms of relationships and diversity, uh, and, or how is my terms of engagement with it that, you know, I've enabled them to keep calling, calling me back and asking for these things. It's a little, you know, so it's a little of both. So go and go and do that audit and sort of assess and say, oops, what needs to shift and change? Great action item for me. I do it myself. I mean, I would say it is one of those things, it's kind of funny. Write a book on networking and you know, they have to eat your own dog food and I have to follow the advice between the two covers. So I'm not just sitting up here flippantly tossing, tossing out, oh, you should do this. He's like, I have to do it myself.

Speaker 1:          24:25          And I do catch myself the so, wow. So you actually just started to touch on something that I'm, I'm excited you brought up around diversity of networks and um, these where we find these groupings and we actually had a great speaker at Google last year, a terror Winston. I'm not sure if other folks are able to tune in a, she's from interacting consulting. It was giving a skills building session at Google last year and she had a quote that stood out to me, uh, that I'd love to hear your thoughts on. She said she warned us against putting your entire network in the same food chain and I'll leave it at that. I'd love to hear what you think about that

Speaker 3:          25:02          physician. I was in, in 2002 I had a network that was very narrow and very deep within the legal industry, but very particular within the legal industry. It was, you know, New York City in Toronto. It was bankers, investment bankers, Wall Street. Um, I'm going to say trustees. It was within a very narrow area of practice. And even though then my next career move I saw within the legal industry, you know, I had nowhere to go unless I wanted to go a general counsel and move to another firm and do the same thing. And so that was a big wake up call for me. So I'm doing this because there's basically two types of networks. Some of them are associated with gender and some of it I want to say like I described my own legal career. Some of us, because of our industry in our profession, we do this with our network.

Speaker 3:          25:57          It becomes very expertise in very narrow. So there's an, there's a narrow deep network that's often associated with women, the types of networks they have. As I described it, I had to guess I had the double whammy on that. I also had it cause I was a lawyer doing a particular area of law. The power and that network is, that's where you have people who've got your back. Um, they're the people who you know, can give you that feedback. Maybe some deep mentorship. They really know you well. That team, you can instantly pull together. On a project. When you have a narrow deep network, you can already see the problem with it. It doesn't create a lot of opportunities. So the other network is a broad, shallow network that's typically associated with the types of relationships that men have. The reality is you need both.

Speaker 3:          26:41          You need those ties, those loose ties or where opportunity comes from. You may not be able to get deep feedback, but you can sure spread a message in a long way. You share can find someone to go, Oh God, yeah, right. I went to college with someone who's doing that. Let me reach out to them and see if they're interested in, you know, talking about it or meeting or whatever. You need both of those. And the reality is our lives do that. You know, you thinking about when you are in college and then those relationships ab out this way further and further, but find ways to keep those people in your periphery. I mean our, we're a case study of that quote in many ways. If you had had just said, all right, I had my nice internship for two months in New York City in 2012.

Speaker 3:          27:29          Thanks very much. See you later. Yeah, when I today here today, right. So Abby had been my intern and I think that's also when you think about food chain, we often think of networking is up the food chain. And the reality is we live in a three 60 world. You never know where opportunities are going to come from. Your next boss may be, you know, 30 years old or 30 years younger was sort of nurture and take care of all the relationships around you. Back to being that decent human being. Cause you never know. You never know who's going to mentor you. You never know where who's was an opportunity's going to come from. You never know who you can help. And that just kind of creates that, that vibrancy and resiliency in a network, which in my mind creates the vibrancy and resiliency in your own career. Great. Thank you.

Speaker 1:          28:25          Um, I have a lot of more questions, quite a few more questions. Um, around social media. You've talked a lot about generosity and how that plays in the network and, but right now I want to ask you one more question then I want to open up to folks on live stream and in the room for questions. So uh, start thinking about him or put them in the door if you feel more comfortable. But my last question for you for now would be, um, if anyone's here was to go home and change only one thing about their know how they network, what would it be?

Speaker 3:          28:56          Change. One thing, it's like the hunger games of your book. You don't know what to do. I said it to two different than these are the biggest networking gives him office to as what is the biggest networking mistake people make and the biggest networking mistake people make is a failure to follow up. And I don't mean by that, the hey Abby, you know the email I could send that say, hey Abby, thanks for very much for arranging this chat today. It's when could I follow up a month from now when? Is there some time that you crossed my mind that I could follow up again? And that failure to follow up with a piece of advice, maybe an introduction someone made, um, whatever it may be. And if you do nothing else from today, like go back to your desk and you know, whatever, sit there and look at your calendar and think, right, where is someone who has done something for me that other than the hey, thanks a lot.

Speaker 3:          29:52          Where can I circle back and let them know what I've done with that guidance or how something turned out and that that type of follow up changes things within networks and that changes relationships. So if you do one thing from today and change one thing, like mastered the art of the followup, that's a great note to take some questions on. Thank you so much. Um, I want to first open it up to the room and see if we have any last questions. I have a question on the gender issue. So yeah, Hindi aren't met and we met very different in networking styles. And how does that differentiate the two genders,

Speaker 4:          30:32          South Korea development? That is a terrific question. In terms of networking and career development. Here's the two things that are running through my mind. Um, one is for people earlier in their career, I often recommend them. I said, look at what it takes for other people to be successful in the area you want to go into. And part of how they're successful is not just the knowledge base, it's how they interact and ask yourself, will I be in successful within that interaction. So I knew I could be successful as a legal career, but if I'd chosen to be a tax attorney I would have been an abject failure. Their way of networking is very technical. It is very research driven and it's very paper driven in terms of writing papers and things and giving, sending updates. That is not me. I was much better off hanging out as I used to refer to them with my frat boy, Wall Street clients.

Speaker 4:          31:31          Cause you know, giving someone a Tequila shot was a heck of a lot easier than spending endless hours researching. But that was my personality type. So look ahead and say how do they interact. I also think this is where there is power in knowing why you want to seek the advice of other people. Because we all operate within, I would say proximity in communities that they may have their patterns of interactions and how you can, you may not want to completely disrupted, but you want to be part of the conversation. And this is where you have to find those opportunities to seek out people in my mind on their advice and their guidance of how they can help you. So for example, to reach out to someone and say, please explain to me, you know, why this happened in your career. Like how did you make the move from HR to engineering? That intrigues me and it doesn't seem to be, you know, a linear career process. How did that come about? People want to talk and share that of particular advice. And so when do you find yourself within an environment that you don't think, well I'm not going to go out and do that type of networking?

Speaker 5:          32:49          Yeah.

Speaker 4:          32:49          Find other ways to have conversation that focuses back on the nature of work. Does that help build a Doherty question? So what advice do you have for introverts? Oh, this is my favorite question. Advice for introverts can, we didn't talk about this. I did mention that the buck is case study driven and I saw people within my network that had a particular outcome and I said, I need you to unpack this because I have a suspicion that you have achieved this school in a networked way by building relationships, seeking the help of others, building your own expertise, sharing that within your network and moving towards whatever your goal is, whether it's up the corporate ladder, starting a, um, I would say a venture capital fund, climbing Everest, et cetera. So I sent out questions to these people in my book and I did not ask them one question.

Speaker 4:          33:46          I didn't ask them their personality type. I didn't ask, how'd you turn? How'd you do on the Myers Briggs? You know, how'd you do? No, didn't ask that question. And my answer's started coming back. Most of the people are, we're featured in the book are introverts and not a little bit introverted, really introverted. I think in this day and age when we are bombarded with opportunities and information online and off and choice, I think people who are more purposeful and conscientious and how they network are better networkers. And my guess is those are introverts in managing your own discomfort, in managing your concern on what you're asking may be and how it may feel or impose on someone else, I think you're better positioned to succeed then extroverts. I'm going to go really out on a limb and say that one. Uh, so my advice to introverts is anytime someone sends you a networking tip that says, you know, maybe it's a link to an article that's hey, 10 things introverts can do to it, you know, network more like extroverts. I want you to hit delete immediately. Someone sends you that advice. I want you to ignore it.

Speaker 4:          34:58          Continue to be conscientious to compete in you, to be purposeful, you know, continue to understand why it is you need to undertake networking activities. One of the great case studies in the book, he's a guy by the name of Joe Styler. Joe Is at Godaddy. He networked his way up from the help desk to the aftermarkets department. So cause I like to say, you know, in my way from being in New York and on Wall Street, you know, from being the receptionist at Goldman Sachs to lead trader, he's made that change in his career, networking, building his expertise, moving his career forward within his industry, um, very purposefully and very intentionally with it and go daddy. And he's like, hey, there's things I know I have to do that, you know, I'm not, if I look at my personality type, I know I'm not comfortable doing them, but I understand now why I need to do them so I can step into that room.

Speaker 4:          35:55          And he's so purposeful and so well researched anytime. I think it's to manage that discomfort. But his case study is an absolutely brilliant one in terms of someone who is introverted, moving their career forward. Because if he had succumb to into introversion and just been told, you know, go network, go work cocktail parties, you'd probably still be, you know, hey, thanks for calling, go daddy, this is Joe. How can I help you instead of in a very fulfilling role within that company and within the industry. A tactical question on Linkedin, uh, what is your thoughts on the linkedin open networkers and how can you use them as a resource? Uh, struggling with that. They open networkers attempts, people actively connecting with other people on Linkedin, right? So they, you know, if you send them a connection, you don't have any connection with them, they will automatically approve you in their network.

Speaker 4:          36:46          I want to know why. So one of the things they, the benefits they do, which may not be a benefit for individuals, but they are able to connect groups that are not actually connected together. So there's a good society that these people play. But I didn't know how other as a individually, tactically, uh, for those folks. Yeah. I mean, here's the thing. I mean I as a networking platform and to date myself as a Rolodex, as a way of keeping eyeballs on contacts and thinking about who and when to contact people depending on where I'm going or industries I'm looking into. I'm a massive fan of linkedin. Um, and I think also too, it is revealed to us, you know, it's not only your own network, it is the second and third degree connections and sort of unveiling that concept to people hadn't heard of it.

Speaker 4:          37:36          I think it's vitally important that like Linkedin as a platform. But there's two things with linkedin. I think we look at it as a platform and technology and we forget that people use it differently and we use it differently at different points in time. So I request to connect without a, without a personal message, I think is meaningless. Tell me, remind me, prompt me how and why. And then when you do that with other people, also remember some of us may be using the network differently. I know some people who use linkedin very closed off. If we haven't sat, you know, face to face. If we haven't broken bread, you're not in my linkedin network. Other people are, oh, you know what? I'm expanding my business. I've got a new role in sales. I've, you know, my own case, I'm going to book this out.

Speaker 4:          38:30          It's a lot wider. So if someone was to message me on linkedin and said, hey, loved hearing your talk at the University of Tampa, like I was the one who asked this question, I'm likely to connect with them. It also makes it, when someone says, can you make an introduction? I see you're connected on Linkedin to this person, can you make the introduction? That's also where you need to understand that they may not have the strongest connection to people to make an introduction. So I would be able to say, oh yeah, that person, I know them. We connect it in Tampa for 10 minutes. You can reach out and use my name, but I don't think I can be that meaningful in terms of anything in depth, in a, in a connection. But we use it differently. And I think there's, that's, you've hit on something in my mind which is bigger, is that we don't, when you have digital tools around networks, when we focus on the tools themselves and the technology, we forget that people use them differently.

Speaker 4:          39:28          And we're just remember always as human beings behind that. And, and think about ways, the way that you using something is not necessarily the way somebody else uses it. And, and, and I would say for anyone, you know, you're in the room and anyone watching, so on my website, Jay Kelly, hawaii.co, it's a.co, not a.com. There's a little box that says, ask Kelly crazy thing comes to me, comes into my Gmail account. Uh, there is no one in between that. So if I, if you don't get your question answered today, just fire me the question. Say that you were watching this and you've got a question and I'll answer up. Jay Kelly, Jay Kelly, hawaii.co ask Kelly and Kelly answers. Great. Thank you. I to build on top of the previous question, what other tools do you use to keep track of fuel network? Oftentimes I realized that I don't remember if people verbal and in order for juniors, I think of this problem of short memory and uh, oftentimes I would find myself, he there was this problem and I didn't think of conducting this person and only two weeks later to realize he would have solved this issue very quickly.

Speaker 4:          40:41          Eh, I wish I had like the magic solution for, for remembering these things. I am very, um, I want to say geography based in my thinking in terms of when I start problem solving. If I think of networking as it gets the way you've just described it, like problem solving, who can help me with this problem? Uh, I'm often very geography or um, company based. When I think of it sometimes I'm like, okay, where did I meet them? Where did I meet them? And I have to kind of like go down this waterfall. I would say for anyone, like figure out how you start to problem solve in these situations. Like who, who have I met and then you'll probably figure out what is the best way for you to organize your contacts. Are you someone who would go to Linkedin? Is a spreadsheet the answer for you, is there some other, yeah. Is it groups on, you know on on a Google plus like figure it out. Start to think about how you

Speaker 4:          41:43          problem solve and need the help of other people and figure out van from there. Right. Where the ways I can clump people in different things to be able to say, you know what, I just met this person we talked to about this stuff. He might, he or she may be a good person to ask this type of question in the future. Figure a way to tag them or do something. But that part of, I think maybe all of this with the book and networking is, is whole lot of self awareness, a whole lot of self awareness about how you operate within this world, but how you reach out to other people and how you can do that in a way that is more effective. But I mean, I wish I had the ultimate dashboard. Maybe that's the next thing I create. 2018. Yeah, there we go. Then we in August didn't have enough projects to be all come on, come up with a dashboard because it is, it is something people are always like where, where is the, you know, the Rolodex, the CRM system.

Speaker 5:          42:36          Okay.

Speaker 4:          42:36          You know, I am not a spreadsheet person, but if that's what works for you, put it in a spreadsheet.

Speaker 5:          42:43          Okay.

Speaker 4:          42:43          And so great to have you here and um, I hesitate to say if you want to leave us with any parting wisdom because I think that's what the last 45 minutes was all about. Any closing thoughts or final, final remarks before we wrap? I just want to say go forth and, you know, be better human beings. So it's, that's all that we all can ask for. And I think, uh, we understand that we're networking with other people that their lives are complicated and messy. If we can stop and observe and listen a little bit more in our before we interact, we will improve our interactions. Thank you. That's great. Kelly. It's been tight.
