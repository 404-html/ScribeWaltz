Speaker 1:          00:08          This is fun guy. These are some of the 1.5 million types of fungi. There's, here's the humongous world of fungus fungi, but one of the first organisms on earth, billions of years ago, fun guy or their own kingdom. They're not animals, plants or bacteria. Fungi live everywhere. Space stations, deserts, deserts, Antarctica, nuclear reactors. There's plenty of shrew for all fungi. Every day you walk on mushroom Mycelium, not just mushrooms, root system, mycelium communicates information, transfers, nutrients. It also builds soil that gives life to all plants on earth. Here is fun guy saving the world. This is fun guys saving you. There's fun guy for relaxation, concentration, energy and immune support. This is you on shrooms tapping into the humongous world. The fungus.

Speaker 2:          01:07          When I say to someone that I'm interested in mushrooms or that I had a mushroom company, you get often few kinds of reactions. Some are like I talking magic mushrooms or and some are like gross. I don't like the flavor of mushrooms and, and some are really excited for various reasons and but, but they are a kingdom as you saw on the video. And when something is a kingdom, that means that there's a lot of different kinds of things. So if you think of all the animals to live on earth, there's quite a few kinds just in mammals compare a Chihuahua and a blue whale and they're drastically different, right? And if you compare even plants, not all plants are good for you. I know obviously plant based diet is right now a big thing, a lot of people on it, but a lot of plans will kill you and mushrooms are no different.

Speaker 2:          01:54          Some of them will hurt you, some of them will heal you. And just to kind of get the mushroom lingo out of the way, mushroom is actually what is called the fruiting body. And fungi is a kingdom, right? Fun guys like the umbrella. But often people, when they talk about the fungi kingdom, they talk about mushrooms. But mushroom is actually like the fruiting body. So let's think of an apple tree, for example, that fruit, the actual apple would be the fruiting body here. That's the part that is visible and you will eat. It usually gets reproduced annually. What some exceptions. And then the rooting system, which is often referred to as mycelium, was also like high fade, like an early Beta version of it. But my psyllium is like the, the actual apple tree itself, the bark and the roots, right? And there's a lot of mycelium underground.

Speaker 2:          02:43          So wherever you will go around the world, they will be mycelium underground. And then sometimes you'll see these fruiting bodies popping up. And the mycelium is really important for environment. And then my sale, the fruiting body can be really helpful for us. So since there's mycelium everywhere, it serves a big purpose. So about 2.4 billion years ago. So if the earth is 4.24 point 5 billion years old, 2.4 billion years ago, um, my mushrooms or fungi came from the seed to the dry land. And what's actually fascinating about mushrooms to me is that they're actually very similar to animals. So we're way closer as humans to mushrooms than we are to, for example, plants for example. Um, mushrooms cannot produce their own food through photosynthesis like plants can they have to eat something. By the way, they also breathe oxygen and expel CO2 just like just like animals.

Speaker 2:          03:45          But they need to eat something. And since nothing else grew on dry land, mushrooms decided to for a little over a billion years eat rocks. So they're survivors, you know. And then later as plans were entered into the, into to Earth, the mushrooms help the plants to collect water and nutrients from the soil. And that happens still today. So almost all plans that you will eat have used fungi to collect water and nutrients. But this is not a biology lesson. I'm not here to talk to you for hours and hours about fun guy. Some of you might find it fascinating, some of you might not, but just wanted to give you kind of a quick overview. And the spores are, by the way, those are the seeds. So you go from the rooting system to the fruiting body. The fruiting body will produce spores. Boards are like the seeds and then the sports will fly away and produce more.

Speaker 2:          04:31          Hi Faye and mycelium. So that's kind of the lifecycle of a mushroom. Um, my company four sigmatic is focused on these functional mushrooms. Those are like healthy mushrooms, often sometimes known as medicinal mushrooms. But since medicinal marijuana, that's often a bad labeled. These are completely legal safe, nothing to do with psychedelics. So that's why I prefer the word functional mushrooms. And these functional mushrooms are all often also called adaptogens. How many have heard the word adaptogen? Could good bunch. Okay. So this is right now really trendy. It's actually not that a new of a concept. It's just become very popular. So adaptogen research started in the Soviet Union for the army. Um, what the army figured out, and this is by the way, not just the Soviet army. I had to go to, I'm from originally, if I'm thin then and I had to go to the Finnish army.

Speaker 2:          05:19          At the same thing is in certain situations the soldiers that given stimulants amphetamine. For example, if you're, I was in the air force, you fly in a fighter jet, you crash on an enemy territory, pump you up a little effort to me in and try to run as far as you can in the next 24 hours. They'll hopefully you'll be saved after that. But what happens is that you have a little bit of a let down, a lighter version of a stimulant might be like Adderall con lighter compared to amphetamine or caffeine that we often consume all the time, right? So the Russian, uh, with the Soviets were like, Hey, is there anything else that we could take which would perform performance, maybe not as much, but will improve performance that wouldn't give you the let down the next day. And they send this doctor, Doctor Zirov, the research, few things and loss of studied the best things that he could find in the world and came up with five things that he thought were adaptogens.

Speaker 2:          06:11          And the word adaptogen comes from the fact that it's helps you to adapt to stressors. So it helps you to adapt to stressors and hopefully it will not give you a let down. So I know something to be an adaptogen, it needs three things. It's non habit forming means it's not addictive. If something is addictive, it cannot be an adaptogen, didn't have to be something you could take every day safely and you don't get used to it. Secondly, it is restores balance. So erosion restores balance in your body. And then finally it's nonspecific, which is often, sometimes hard if you have a scientific mind to figure out. Cause scientific studies are usually done on one single variable, one marker. And when something is nonspecific, it can help with the brain and the immune function. And that can be complicated. And that's where it's often in health, like hormones for example, or even though you have a marker like testosterone, it's sometimes complicated because hormones go up and down, you pull a lever, another one goes up or a doubt, right?

Speaker 2:          07:10          But that's what an adapted in Zuora. That's what some of these best mushrooms are as well. And these are, um, kind of my passion. I would say. I'm, I love fun guy and I love the biology of fun guy, but I'm mostly interested in is what can the fun guy do for you? How can it improve your cognitive function, your immune system, your skin? Um, I've been running my business now for about seven years. Normally I'd been traveling 40 to 60 times a year and during that time I've lived in, in the last 10 years I've lived in 10 countries and I've not been sick in 11 years. And one of the reasons why I have to thank is, is the use of adaptogens and mushrooms for immune system. But back to my story, so I was brought up in Finland. I'm a 13th generation farmer and mushroom enthusiast and I was brought, brought up to learn about mushrooms through my mom, my mom when I was like Yay high with my brother.

Speaker 2:          08:09          We went foraging for mushrooms. And one of the first things that people get wrong about mushrooms that they're always grow in the ground. They actually also grow on trees. This is the Chaga mushroom that we also use an uh, the mushroom coffee that is outside. And a lot of them are hard. You can't eat them. Actually you should not eat mushrooms raw. Does the General Fund, whatever mushroom we're talking about don't have them rock cause they have this structure called team that is we humans are not really good at absorbing. And there we lack this enzyme. Um, think of a, the shell of a lobster is made out of Chitin so try eating a lobster shelf. Not Good. So you kind of have to process it. But they are these beautiful creatures. Most people just think of that classic mushroom shape with the, with which I showed you with the stem and the cap and there's so many different shapes and sizes, different types of mushrooms and, and some of the best ones growing trees.

Speaker 2:          09:04          Cause like I mentioned mushrooms like animals, they need something to eat. And often when people ask me like what should you eat? What's a healthy diet? I joked to them is that you should eat dirt and trees. The healthiest thing you can eat is dirt and trees. Unfortunately not, we're not equipped to assimilate either of them. So we need to eat something that has eaten them. So things that grow in the soil that had minerals and then can get the good gut biome from the soil into our body. And also trees are incredibly healthy. So obviously from maple syrup to pine pollen, but also these tree mushrooms that serves so many different functions. Um, this is called Turkey tail. This was called Rishi and a lot of the mushroom names are a little exotic cordyceps, which is used for performance. That is the lion's mane.

Speaker 2:          09:55          This is right now one of the most popular mushrooms in the U S it's a Toyota to help with focus and cognitive function. And it's funny how they look as well is like lion's mane. Um, looks like a, I guess like a main of alliance. So that's how it's named that way. But um, my fascination with these is mostly through the health benefits. Like you saw in the beginning, video mushrooms are used in almost have of, of the pharmaceuticals out there. Penicillin is the one you would know. But out of the 20 best selling drugs and and about 10 utilize fungi and they can be used to clean oil spills. They can, uh, help remove diesel from the soil. Um, they can eat plastic. Few years ago we found a mushroom that eats plastic. Plastic has been around a hundred, hundred and 20 years. And so far we haven't figured out what kind of Wa wa does it a composed or not, we don't know yet, but we found a mushroom that likes to eat it and then we can eat the mushroom and it has health benefits.

Speaker 2:          10:53          But I think the environmental change is, it's hard to change the world through the environmental impact. It's hard to change the world to sometimes, um, a lot of like very esoteric topics. But what often people are first interested in, hey, what can I do today? The field good today, right. And mushrooms can help with that. Here's a little chart that shows a mushroom Chaga, which is this one girl was on a birch tree. It grows for a 10 to 25 years. So very slowly. And Birch has these healthy compounds like Betalin and beds, folinic acid. That's why if you go to Finland or Russia, you get, he hit yourself with birch leaves because they have these healthy oils and the bark and that kind of the mushroom kind of eats them and then gets them in a form that then we can utilize. And the amount of antioxidants as quite incredible.

Speaker 2:          11:41          So antioxidants are, are one of the things that are most proven for general health and wellness in the world. It's kind of a buzzy word. People don't really know what it means, but there are color pigments. Not all color pigments are antioxidants, but all antioxidants are color pigments. It's like the champagne thing with the sparkling wine and all sparkling wine, champagne bottle, champagne and sparkling wine, right? And these color pigments can help with cardiovascular health. They can help protect our immune system. A lot of the most common ways how people die today and they can really help with, um, longevity and um, and people off the internet loves to debate Wah Wah. Antioxidants are good and what they're on, what has the highest amount, but just for the sake, the two big bubbles are how two different ways, how you can press it, process a wild Siberian Chaga, and then you have some of the other more antioxidant rich foods from dark chocolate too aside Barry.

Speaker 2:          12:33          And this gives you an idea how abundant these mushrooms are in these nutrients and how potentially you could benefit from them. And that's chart on how to use them. So mushrooms are often used for most people. They're used in like pizza or pasta or something like the very narrow focus. People mostly focus on Porta Bella and like crimeny type mushrooms may be she talkie and she talk is a good mushroom, but a lot of these culinary mushrooms are not that good. They grow in the ground and they're not that nutrient dense. They're kind of like mass produced. Think of like your normal culinary mushrooms, almost like, like iceberg lettuce versus a Rugala, right? There's nothing wrong with iceberg lettuce, but the clearly nettle or dandelion or Rugala has a lot more, you know, punch and the same with mushrooms. And, um, when we talk about, um, generally about mushrooms, it's like anything is like you have really good, really average and then really bad things.

Speaker 2:          13:31          And that's where actually my company and four sigmatic also stems from is just geeky out of math. So if you take all the worlds foods, there's roughly like let's say 1.8 million things you can eat and you put it on a bell curve, get and compared their nutrient density, it will form a normal distribution. And this is normally a science including natural sciences. If you take a large enough sample size, you look at single variable. I see how tall are people or, or how, what is their Iq tends to form an Olam and distribution, the food side of the same. And if you look at their nutrient dense city, most foods are just normal good. Some, some are like solid health foods and then some foods are kind of bad, right? And if you go for a standard deviations, which I know sigmas they go four standard deviations, you get to the top 50 foods in the world, right?

Speaker 2:          14:17          And out of those top 50 foods, there are things like lemon, black pepper, cinnamon, coconut, green tea, a Cacau, things that, you know, then there's foods that you might know like turmeric or gin sang or Makkah. And then there's really foods that very few people know, like the Reishi mushroom more stragglers route. And I, I'm just passionate about the things that are the most currently scientifically studied foods. And funny enough, those tend to be also the foods that have been used the longest throughout different cultures. So every part of the world tends to have their own like foods that they've elevated to kind of, um, a sacred status over multiple generations. And every generation after that has thought that that food is special for some reason. So if you go to Bali or Costa Rica or you go to Finland and Russia or you go to Africa, you will find certain foods are elevated over others.

Speaker 2:          15:08          And that's what I'm most passionate about. And out of those 50, about 10, our mushrooms, that's our farm where I grew up. And I think the, besides the health benefits of mushrooms, the one thing that I really want to kind of leave you today with is just generally about how what it takes to do something new. I feel like the talk, the topic was like how to dirt moved from dirt to gold and I think that's the lesson that I've learned over the years of coming from a small farm in Finland to Venice Beach, California and building a business and creating companies like understanding that in order to create value or capture value, you have to see on devalued things. Okay, so any form of business beat investing or something else, you're trying to find an acid or a thing that has more value than other people think.

Speaker 2:          16:02          Like you think the stock is worth $10 but the market things, it's $5 if you buy it at five you think eventually the market will know it's worth 10 right? The same with if you start a business or you have an idea, you try to find something that others don't yet see or they see it, but they don't understand the true value and power of it. So probably let's say Google in the early days there were people who thought, oh, search engine, it has value, right? It's some value. But then people didn't see what's the implications of having that value and how you can transport it to other factors. And then investors are Google probably made, you know, good profit by seeing that it was an undervalued asset. Right? So I'm from, uh, I'm from a town of maybe like 150 people and I'm there, you know, like I didn't travel growing up and I, my dream is to get Americans to drinking mushrooms.

Speaker 2:          16:53          That's a pretty radical idea, right? So it's like I came here, I had started the business and I'm like, I told everyone is like, hey, I want to get the whole of America drinking mushrooms. Cause that's the most ancient way of actually consuming these tree mushrooms. And I know their benefits and people like you're crazy. Nobody drinks mushrooms around here. Right? So, but I believed in it, which is kind of one of the three tips I want to leave you guys today with from the business side is if, if if you want to achieve anything, you have to be super passionate about it and believe in it. And the second thing is that hopefully whatever you do is based on some first principles with me it was science, understanding the research amount of mushrooms, understanding their history and their culture implications and also understanding how to prepare them.

Speaker 2:          17:36          And so you, you can't just make up stuff. It needs to be based on some sort of like first principle or a logic. And then finally is like as you start building the business, um, you know, forget remembering why you started this is I was a couple of weeks ago in lap plan with bunch of friends. Um, it was minus 39 degrees and went to frozen water. It's actually below, it's like 25 degrees. There's a stream that keeps the water open. Like this is the culture. Why I started the business is the Finnish culture and the culture of like a natural living. And then I moved to California to build the business. And sometimes the life here is not as natural as it was at a farm, but it's like really important for me as I go to remind myself why I started the business. So, um, uh, this is the he culture.

Speaker 2:          18:24          This is the only indigenous culture in Europe. Um, uh, partly partly in Finland as well. And how they use mushrooms is one of the sources of inspiration for me. And here's examples of products that we do like mushroom coffee and mushroom chocolate lattes won this tonics. And, and one of the reasons why we do this is that mushrooms, the healthy mushrooms don't taste anything like Portabella. They actually tastes very bitter and most Americans don't like bitter. So when I came here and I made like mushroom tea, people are like, this is gross. I first of all, I don't like tea. Second meat, I don't like this flavor. So I had to kind of reverse engineer and figure out what are the bitters that Americans like or most angle section culture is like. And I figured out there's only a couple coffee and chocolate, um, black coffee and dark chocolate with some of the only bidders that were commonly available to people.

Speaker 2:          19:11          So using those pallets and those delivery systems as incorporating into people's lives. But um, to kind of recap, um, just some of the books I've written, one about the history of the Samei people want cook book, how to use mushrooms and, and about the top 10 mushrooms. But to recap, kind of my talk is, um, I believe in the power of mushrooms. I think they're, uh, uh, an organism much smarter than we realize. I think they're an undervalued and that's why I'm also excited to build a business around them. I believe a lot in their power for myself, but also I believe that you should focus on doing something that is undervalued and getting people to understand the value. Then that's also smart business. Um, I think if you want to learn more about mushrooms, there's a lot of resource that you can go to.

Speaker 2:          20:01          I can rip, highlight too few books and um, and learning methods how are you can learn about them. And I think in the next 10 years we'll see multiple different research coming out from mushrooms for health benefits, for cognitive function, for immune system. That I think will shock a lot of people. And uh, that gets me excited every day to just start building four. Sigmatic. But with that, um, if you have any questions about the health benefits on forcing Madec or the mushrooms in general, if you have questions on, on anything mushroom related, happy to take it.

Speaker 3:          20:38          Yeah. This isn't about mushrooms, but, um, seals eat mushrooms. Does that mean snails are healthy too? Um,

Speaker 2:          20:50          yes and no. So not big as they eat mushrooms. That's not the reason. So there's sort of mammals that eat mushrooms, bears, deer, rabbits, they're sort of insects that eat mushrooms. That doesn't mean that that's why that species is good for you. But I would say generally, uh, we are very focused as a culture on, on large mammals that have flesh. This is like a complete separate topics from health. We're really obsessed about just eating few types of animals. So that classic debate is [inaudible] animals with, shoot I not I'd animals but often it's coming from a lens of eating mostly large mammals that are very domesticated, that are almost always female. We almost own the EAD women. So, uh, we don't eat bull, we eat the cow, we don't eat like a boar. We the female a chicken the same. We don't eat the rooster and we very highly processed animals and we don't even eat the whole piece of that animal.

Speaker 2:          21:45          We mostly focused on the flesh part versus like the liver and the, the eyeballs and all the things that people, most people think it's gross is actually like really nutrient dense and a lot of insects and smaller animals tend to be healthier actually cause they're lower in the food chain. So you tend to be like the Lord you're in the food chain and early you are the cleaner it is. Or if you go further in the food chain and you go to bigger animals or even bigger fish, you have to be more careful about the quality. So it's usually safer to eat a small fish than a big fish, but you really have to know what the big fish is coming. So, but it's not because they eat mushrooms. That's why snails a healthy, they just are.

Speaker 4:          22:21          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          22:22          Can you pass the mic to, you can throw it. I uh, thanks for the talk. Yeah. Uh, you raised the point about bitterness. Uh, I was just wondering like, have you found yourself, uh, compromising and the healthiness of the mushrooms by like adding sugar at any point or,

Speaker 2:          22:45          yeah, most of our products don't have sugar and I don't really believe in adding sugar, especially processed sugar. We have a couple products that have coconut palm sugar, about two grams per serving. Awesome. And coconut palm sugar is a lot healthier, has more minerals. And is it more kind of diabetic friendly but don't believe in adding sugar? We use things like monk fruit and Stevia and certain products and certain products or just unsweetened, it's kind of this healthy balance of like knowing where the market is and knowing where you want to get to. Right. And kind of like bridging the gap. So let's assume you want really technology. I'm from Finn than we are. We love like, like my SQL and leanings and all this stuff. Lean never really got big accepting servers just because partly because they use are in the phase was it was not the easiest to use.

Speaker 2:          23:29          Right. And um, and, or even know Kia where our farm is, is like think of Nokia leading the mobile technology and then apple taking over. And it's partly because apple is just, iPhone was just so much easier to use for most people. Right. And Nokia's weren't always not. And the same here is like, if my dream is to get here, but consumers are here, how do I meet them in the middle? How do I make a product that is a little more bitter than what they're used to? A little less sweet, a little less artificial. Still healthy. Yeah. But I kind of meet them because without compliance there's no change. There's no like you can buy a pass to the gym but you feed never go. It doesn't help you. So rather do a shitty workout than no workout. So in this case the same thing. But yeah, I wouldn't add, um, I wouldn't add much sugar or any sugar to these products because I think it jeopardizes the main function, which is kind of being more like anti inflammatory and protecting the immune system. And when you add the sugars and sweeteners, it can kind of do the opposite. Mushrooms can also balanced blood sugar and support, um, um, blood sugar management. So when you kind of do that, it kind of counterbalances the benefit. So. Yeah. That's great. Thanks. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          24:41          so I've heard a formulating new products and bring them to market is like a multi year process and it takes a lot of r and D and energy for. Um, I'm curious, you have a lot of different products that keep seeing new stuff that you introduce quite regularly. How long is your design process,

Speaker 2:          25:03          by the way? Thank you for asking that. The, you're the first person to ever ask it. I'm very passionate about this topic. So I'm the, like the product founders. If we will be a tech company, I would be like loving to make the code myself. And I'm like, this is a really a topic that I could talk for days. So you're right, most of the people take multiple years to build a product. Uh, for us, my goal is two months realistically where three but it's still drastically shorter than for most people. And that requires a few fundamental things to be in place to innovate so quickly. So obviously like sourcing ingredients, any ingredients that are going to use, you have to be really good at that. So you have to have a baseline infrastructure of like, hey dude, why do you get products? But that's still like somewhat easy to solve where most even large companies take years to develop a product and they don't succeed with it.

Speaker 2:          25:49          And I think one of the key things why we've been successful in a short while, um, building products is a couple of fundamental things that I think is transferable to any industry, any product, any situation. First of all, being close to the end consumer, right? Lot of people who, especially large companies try to create products from an ivory tower. They send out surveys and focus groups and whatever, try to figure out what's the trend. They read reports and I think they're already from them. They're behind the curve versus every day engaging with the consumer and knowing what's out on the market and listening to their needs and wishes. So we do tons of community work in person, uh, to meet people, to talk with them and being in that interface. So whatever you're trying to build, the more time you can spend or actually even be the consumer who I think ims as well as everyday using these products myself is easier.

Speaker 2:          26:43          The R and D is, and the more removed you are from the end consumer, target consumer or that lifestyle or the industry, whatever the harder days, right? Sometimes you can get too close to it. Yes. But nevertheless, like the closer you are to interface. So I could come out with 20 to 30 product ideas in an hour just by looking my own lifestyle in different parts of my day, a week, a month, a year, and figure out where the gaps, where I need optimal performance. So where do I need a boost and enhance a support and it would be so easy. And then you kind of pick your battles like what is easy to execute, why has big upside? And then the other thing that is very few people have is it besides the customer proximity or the customer interface with with products is that they think they have to be right.

Speaker 2:          27:33          And I think even our best products are currently best selling products. I've gone through multiple iterations and I think if you remove your ego and you just have like, Hey, I have a thesis. This is what I hope to get eye health, gut health. Okay. I think most people that gut is messed up because a, B, and c and this time of the day they need support. Hey, this is my idea. Let's bring this light to make healthy lemonade, whatever it is, and then you're trying to innovate for it. And then he'd come with the concept of the market. You let people try it, they give you feedback and then you iterate. Most large companies especially, they want to get the product be so good from the get go and probably, I mean Gmail or something like that has gone through seemingly so similar calm through, you know, hundreds of thousands of iterations over the years.

Speaker 2:          28:18          Right? And that's us how it is. And I think most people try to get a perfect product from the, from the beginning. And that's a big failure. So we have a big direct to consumer business besides the retail business with um, whole foods and Erewhon and Sephora and whoever we work with. Um, but with that online kind of like email list and our community, we can test products really quickly and within like 30 days, we saw how many people bought it. We can send them a survey, ask them what they think in 45 days to 60 days. We know how many people have those repeat purchases and then we already have a good baseline understanding of how to make it better. So being really close to the customer and not being scared to fail or be ready to iterate, like we assume that we will not get it right and we assume that we need to tweak it and amended over the ghost. And we also assume that some of them like have the products will be discontinued at some point. You're more likely to create more innovation versus if you're always scared to fail, then you're kind of be frozen and you try to perfect it. So I don't know if that helped with that. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          29:21          Yeah. Hey, uh, I got here a little late so I don't know if he covered the salary, but that's like, um, what was, uh, some of your biggest challenges to like growth in the early stages? Like getting your first customer. Like what did that look like? What did you switch? Should have you spent more time, which should have you

Speaker 2:          29:42          de prioritized, I guess getting through that initial hurdle where you, no one knows who four sigmatic is suddenly, you know, you have your first customer, what does that look like? Sure. So I started the company in Europe and then when I brought it to us, so I have, I have to go twice through the process when I was like first getting the first customer in Europe and then came to the u s and nobody cares about what you did in Europe that Americans just don't care at all. So he kind of had to restart. So when I started in Europe, it was actually really easy for me to get the first customers because I was in that industry and I had tons of friends. So the first 50 to a hundred people, I was just like friends that people I knew, which is really valuable because you get really get feedback really quickly.

Speaker 2:          30:20          But he was a lot harder to scale. So in Europe it was easy to get initial traction, but then harder to scale for us. And some of the things I spend a lot of time focusing in on is the ingredient and sourcing, which is like the geeking out part. And unfortunately in most consumers don't care. But it was important for me to know that I had like the best raw materials. I don't regret it, but it definitely took a lot longer. The second thing is that I didn't raise venture funding, I didn't have capital. So even if you had success just by not having a lot of cash, you have to kind of really slowly chip away. And that was a big hurdle having patients because as an entrepreneur you want everything to happen overnight and just crush it and kill it. And when you didn't have cash and you had a big dream of getting people to drink mushrooms and nobody drank mushrooms, it was like really hard.

Speaker 2:          31:04          So having patients and, and then figuring out how to scale, I had initial traction, but how to scale was really difficult in the beginning. Um, and then if I say something other than that is like the flavor was as something that we focused a lot on. And if you don't have a food or beverage product, just the user ease of user experience is kind of maybe the touch point is like I as I was so obsessed with the technology and the ingredients versus not enough with the flavor and the ease of use straight out of the gates. And then when I came to the u s the challenge was being an immigrant. I've lived in multiple countries, but this is the only country where it really felt like it was hard to open a bank account. You know, everything was so difficult and um, that took a lot of time and it was harder here to get the initial traction.

Speaker 2:          31:52          But then when it's scaled and scaled more beautifully, there's just one language. One currency versus Europe is multiple languages, multiple, you know, Lee legally just the hassle, the u s it was just easier to scale. And I had already thought about that scaling and what I've would have hoped I focus even more on is sound. The thing that we, people think we did really well, but I just think you can never do it well enough is storytelling and community. And if you ask people in the industry, they often know that we build an awesome community, but I've wished I would have even doubled down on that and maybe focus a little less on kind of the minutia of, of, of just like retailers and caring about the industry stuff, the B2b folk stuff. I should have focused even less on an even more double down on community and storytelling and, and get those, those made it even better.

Speaker 2:          32:40          So I got, so I want to sort of silo in on, on one point there. Yeah. Um, so what would you say was your best growth channel in that early stage? Was it content? Was it, you know, building a community? Was it Instagram? Was it purely growth marketing wise? Um, our success because we didn't have money and I couldn't do any, so there, if there's t three types of media, there's paid, owned and earned. We mostly eat, killed it with the, with the earned and through influencers is because your favorite health influencers, favorite influencer probably used our products. It's still today if you think of the person you go to in health advice, whoever they go to for health advice, use our products. And through that we had this constant and I credibility and like support from people that it really mattered and that helped us grow into the one phase.

Speaker 2:          33:32          And then soon after that, um, we started winning with like podcasts. Like that was a big thing for us is because podcast allowed long form content. Our topic is not easy. It's not bullet sizable. You can sell it on as easily on um, uh, 22nd 15 second Instagram story or something like that. He requires deeper explaining and trust. I was like, hey, mushroom coffee sounds gross. I definitely don't want to try that. But if somebody you trust says is actually doesn't taste like mushrooms and it makes me feel awesome, you should try it, you're more likely to try it. So on the kind of second wave long forms content, really worked for wealth for us predominantly podcast, but also long email marketing, blog post, other educational forums. But the Spi podcast was, I think still podcast is so undervalued as a form of, uh, as a, as a growth way for any, any product or service. Thank you.

Speaker 7:          34:27          Yeah, yeah, I found out through Tim Ferriss, so now. Cool. Yeah. Yeah. Um, so I'm curious how you were talking about sourcing and then you also mentioned how, uh, large scale mushroom production kind of lost its nutrition. Um, and then I was also thinking about, I've read that truffle production is down about 99% over the last hundred years due to like too much harvesting of wild truffles and they're hard to grow in microrisal and whatnot. Um, so how do you view a sourcing and maintaining quality and the sustainability thereof?

Speaker 2:          35:07          Yeah, definitely. Again, a topic, thanks for asking. Like, I don't think a lot of people focus on that. There's a lot of foods that have become popular at Saint Chia seeds or Makkah and then suddenly people like we can't actually produce that. That would be like Internet kind of made few things really popular really quickly. And agriculture is a slow moving thing. It's like it doesn't change overnight. You can't just physical agriculture doesn't, you can't just, it takes a long time. And farmers are usually are risk adverse and a little bit is like they're not going to change their plans because Instagram influencers to sell Chia seeds or something like that. So with mushrooms we were about one third of our mushrooms are wild crafted, two thirds are grown on logs and if wildcrafting is the hardest part and the La growing is the easier part because it's Super um, good yield.

Speaker 2:          35:54          So dollar per square feet is a really high, so you take trees that are already dead because that's their natural habitat. A lot of these mushrooms grow on debt or decaying trees. You drill a hole, it would a spore and they will grow a mushroom that you can for that square food. You can get a lot of money. So there is that part is a little easier, especially when you talk to people who understand what mushrooms to grow. So and mushrooms or extra fields. So they grow really easily, is it you just give them the right environment. So that to third part is the easy that wildcrafting crafting was the hardest part, right? Because you have to actually, somebody needs to go to the forest and pick up a piece of Chaga to get this. And I could talk for this for hours. Um, the one benefit we had is Finland is a small country, but it's bordering.

Speaker 2:          36:37          I used to have the, one of the biggest economic borders in the world between Finland and Russia and Russia starting from thin than they have just happens to have the largest force in the world called Taiga, ta Iga. And that's a forest size of United States. So one forest size of United States, right. And that forest is predominantly perfect for a birch tree that happens to grow Chaga and he happens to grow pretty much everywhere. And you just need to kind of know where it grows and how to collect it. But it's more like education on harvesters and, and telling them where to get in and how to get it. That was like operational and it a little bit more difficult. Um, but yeah, it takes a lot of thinking and most people don't focus on it. They just read on our block that outside berries, good for you.

Speaker 2:          37:22          And then let's say a loss Iberia. And they don't never think about the supply chain until they're much later in the process. And this is even with college and right now there's like most college and brands are, they don't have enough college and to sell because college has become popular. And I don't know if you know how you may collagen basically, usually a boy like the hides and the bones and you kind of skim the cream on the top and it's like a quite the process and, and it was just the waste product before Kiner and now it's become like every um, yeah, beauty person is trying to use college and every athlete's trying to use college and as the p the demand just went sky high and few years and people are like, hey, we don't have enough of this. So now they have trying to figure out how else can we produce Collagen. So yeah, most entrepreneurs don't think about that. So thanks for asking that. Thank you. I love this by the way, you can throw it.

Speaker 8:          38:16          Thanks for your talk has been really interesting. Um, how do you go about picking which mushrooms are going to end up in, in the te products or the coffee products and, and how do you figure out what the benefits are that you can advertise associated with the mushrooms that you've picked?

Speaker 2:          38:33          Sure. So that's actually easier than with most food products with mushrooms. Because you have to cook them cause they're not bioavailable raw. It's like a rock. There's few outside if you want to try them. So you have to cook them kind of like you would do bone broth. So you do this like decoction so you cook it for a long time and because you can control the temperature and the amount of mushrooms you can standardize your certain strength. So it's almost like cooking it for days to a standardize it to a certain strength of coffee and it's a very easy lab test just to make you have a strong enough team. So some years you have to use more mushrooms than other times and sometimes you can use less. Sometimes we have to cook it longer or shorter so you can just control the, the process to get standardized output.

Speaker 2:          39:16          So yeah, it's actually that part is quite easy to engineer but you just need to, sometimes you have more mushrooms so sometimes we're more profitable than other times. I guess that's the other way to say it is sometimes it costs more to make that cup and sometimes less. And then for figuring out like what the health benefits are, is that like historically based like yeah, traditions. Yeah. And if I may comment on that, that's a, that's a common theme that I hope us as a consumers will be more educated on is we want everything standardized. And I don't think nature works like that our product is standardized, but I would hope that we as consumers can accept the fact that sometimes that the nutrient density of the food we buys higher or lower depending on seasonality and what you eat. And I think us expecting always to get the same flavor, same result, is forcing us to eat actually worst food because then the producers have to produce a product like that.

Speaker 2:          40:08          The apple to always taste the same and it's just nature doesn't work like that. So if we can accept some variability in flavor and nutrient density, as long as we know the baseline, a sourcing that will be actually better for the world than always expecting the chocolate to taste the exactly the same because even chocolate has seasonal variety. But to your second question about nutrient density. So, um, the benefit of mushrooms is that about 40% of pharmaceuticals use mushrooms. So there's, there's a lot of research funding for fungal research. Um, this is unfortunately, there's not a lot of research funding for whole foods. So of all foods, even let's say blueberry, which is people generally, everybody knows it's healthy and it's very, it's been a long time. It's research. There isn't that much research on blueberries, you know, cause it, who would fund that? There's no economic interest on blueberry research.

Speaker 2:          40:59          A, if somebody research booberry they want to isolate a compound and I'm the CNN in the blueberry that is good for eyesight. And then we'll brand it us the Laskin on the CNN and they will put it in supplements and sell it. But, so that whole food research by at large is so limited versus something that you can patent because you can't pass in whole foods. But lucky enough because mushrooms, there is a lot more of them. I would recommend if you want to look at any food product pup met is kind of a database for various just research. You can put the Latin name of any food you can get. Roughly the amount of research than fact that there's 5,000 research papers doesn't mean it's healthy. You know, the most research fruits in the world, our tobacco number one and marijuana and number two.

Speaker 2:          41:40          Um, soon after that you get to things like lemon and Ginseng and other things like that. So it doesn't guarantee if something is well researched that it's healthy, but it gives you a pretty good oversight or what it is good for. And Mushrooms, she talky Rishi, things like that are very well studied. Um, so you look at their general research and you figure out that they're good for like maintaining a blood glucose levels. They're good for gut health. You kind of like give oversight and then we make first just to be safe side, we make buffery claims. So instead of saying is that you will be smarter when you consume our products, we say, hey, this is like a hug from your grandma. And then you can do the rest. But um, yeah, it's baseline on just heart science on uh, um, a genus of anything.

Speaker 2:          42:25          And then looking at what is it generally good for, how well is it's research who researched it, how they researched it, and then you kind of try to apply it into a food product. Um, but yeah, I mean just unfortunately there just isn't a lot of whole food research since you can't own that research, you can't patent it. So, right. So challenge one if you want to, I'm just curious to know about your mushroom diet, like how you use these products and what kind of mushrooms they use and how do you cook them and all that kind of stuff. So I don't answer that question partly ever including I don't answer how I eat because people want a shortcut and how I eat is not necessarily how you should eat or how I use mushrooms is not necessarily how you should use mushrooms. Also, how I use mushrooms in February, 2019 is not hot necessarily.

Speaker 2:          43:17          I'll use them in March. March is a busier month for me than February. So maybe when I'm busy I have to use different things to support my busy lifestyle. Right. Um, I had that one slide somewhere here. Give you a rough idea of timeframes. So generally speaking, like you don't necessarily want caffeine in the morning because your cortisol already spikes. A lot of people love it as a method, but you're naturally should be energetic. You should probably go outside, get some fresh air, maybe move a little bit, but you want to hydrate and you probably want antioxidants like a shield, a bodyguard for the day. So mushrooms like Chaga and she to that have a lot of sod. Super Oxide dismutase is this super antioxidant. Using things like that might be really good for the day to kind of get started. And then in the afternoon when you need a little pick me up using something like lion's mane that boost cognitive function or using something like core to steps that gives you energy without caffeine or sugar might be a good idea.

Speaker 2:          44:17          When you naturally get that little dip in the afternoon, the best scenario is you taking a nap or a Siesta. But if that's not possible because of work, maybe try something like that. And then the evening time you one things that um, support somehow kind of calming down process. So Rishi is used for kind of like kind of the endocrine system, the HPA axis, kind of calming your body. It's known as the Queen of Mushrooms maybe will help you reach deeper sleep. And then she talked a good help with phase one and two liver detox that often happens over night. So that might be a good strategy if you want to cleanse your liver. Liver is a kind of a mirror to skin health as well. So there are different times how you can use it. I just never answered how I use it. You just have to figure out yourself.

Speaker 2:          44:58          I know it's not the answer people want because they want to formula do a, B and c, but uh, maybe that gives you some framework. Yeah. I wasn't looking for a formula. I was just curious how you apply this a lot different ways and uh, yeah, and high quality. That's my three, four thanks varieties, huge bubble. Even if you can have an adaptogen, you can use everyday varieties. Awesome. So even with dark leafy Greens, even if it Rugal is awesome or dandelion is awesome, try all kinds of Greens and just kind of mixed them, match them. And same with mushrooms. It's beneficial to mix and match them. And so even though I'm not a fan of Portabella, you can still have it, uh, just get different varieties into a system. And the more variety you have, the more intelligence you're getting from food into your, uh, into your cells and into your DNA.

Speaker 2:          45:52          Yeah. Sorry, I might've missed this when you were talking about scaling, but, uh, in terms of a timeline, uh, I was wondering what was the, how long did it take for you to go from zero or not zero, but like a product idea to get like a package product ready for the market? Um, it took about two years on the first time because you have to solve the operational challenges, which is, is harder for me than the, the product concept. So the first time sourcing ingredients, getting a partner who can make the packaging. That took a lot longer than coming out with the wisdom and the vision and the use case. So that was easier for me. But maybe for another founder it's different. But if you've never done food or beverage manufacturing, I highly recommend having patients that he might take a lot longer to actually get the product produced than you think.

Speaker 2:          46:43          If you have a donut that everybody, all your neighbors love your donut and your friends and family and saying, you should make this donut. It's a hit, it's a great doughnut. And then you figure out that you've been making at home and now you need an FDA approved commercial kitchen or contract manufacturer to make it. It could take a lot longer than you think. So it took about two years to get the first version out. Partly was my incompetent, like not just me, just not knowing enough of the details. It probably takes about a year and normally just to cut every paperwork in order. And for me it took two years just because I didn't know all the details too. Like did you have to do most of it yourself? Or they're like contractors that do it. Like a bunch of different, I had to do most with myself and my founding team because nobody had done what we did.

Speaker 2:          47:28          Nobody had done a dual extracted Warcraft and mushroom. Nobody had done it so they have to figure that out. Nobody had done these packaged mushroom beverages. They were sold in capsules or in big ground bag. So I have to figure out how to book these mushroom powders in packets that look like almost like emergency or a tea back that you can just pour in a cup and add hot water. I got to figure out that kind of stuff and there wasn't, but if you ever think of doing a dietary supplement, there's like hundreds of companies that can help do it. If you want to make a beverage yourself, there's hundreds of companies making it. I would just highly recommend is that don't outsource r and d and IP fully to someone ever. Like, even if you use their resources for certain things, always have really engage you or someone else in the team really engaged in that process.

Speaker 2:          48:12          So you know, a how it's done. So it's easier for you to sell on marketing because you know, it was like, Hey, is it you? How has this natural orange flavor made? Is it from a squeeze from an orange or how do we get this orange flavor into your product? That's like a question somebody might ask you. So you know the answer. But second, the as well as like, then you own the technology because in food and beverage there really isn't the same way quarter technology and that you have and in it, so be really engaged. And there's definitely a lot of resources for beauty, skincare, protein, food and beverage. Just for me, there wasn't because nobody had done what we did. Yeah. Okay. Last one.

Speaker 9:          48:52          Just when it comes at you catch it. So you've talked about mushrooms, you know, breathing and uh, and the eating and being a smarter food. Um, are you saying that mushrooms have like a, a type of consciousness that is measurable?

Speaker 2:          49:10          Yes, that's what I'm exactly saying. And you can measure it and they've measured it multiple times. They put mushrooms in a maze and funny enough the mushroom finds its way out of the maze. They put mushrooms to figure out how to build that their subway system in in Tokyo or actually the railway system in the UK and the mushroom figured out how to build a railway system more efficient than what humans had built. So yes, it is measurable. I also think that the most interesting intelligence that mushroom have of global consciousness is not measurable and we have no clue of it. And I think we will not have a cool of it for a long, long time. And that will be a whole nother talk about the consciousness of mushrooms. But yes, I think they're higher beanie. I'm just leaving you with a nugget. Planting a seed is that mushrooms almost always live with bacteria and bacteria almost always lives with mushrooms.

Speaker 2:          50:03          So right now in your body there's about 10 times more bacteria than you have cells in your body. And there's a lot of cells and almost always this bacteria lives with mushrooms. If you take Kombucha, it's a symbiotic organism, basically brewed black tea with a little bit of sugar that interacts with bacteria and fungi. If you think of fermented foods, Sauerkraut, Kimchi, whatever, and right now we've talked about how your gut is your second brain or your first brain, how we talk about your gut instinct, your spider sense, how you just know something, you can't explain it in words, but you feel it, you know it. And it's often related to your gut biome, which is now a big research topic. And how that got biome is actually tied into probiotics and prebiotics and how those prebiotics live with the bacterial kingdom and the fungal kingdom.

Speaker 2:          50:52          And they have knowledge that we've yet to figure out. And I think that knowledge is much greater than us. And they found mushrooms growing at every level of the atmosphere. Mushrooms can survive in space. So they've traveled a long ways and different places. And I think I'll probably, I don't think during my lifetime we'll figure out that intelligence, but I do believe that one of the things that will happen during my lifetime is we'll find the seventh kingdom in biology. I think there'll be a new kingdom that is not named yet and that kingdom will be somehow related to the, to the yeast or the collaboration between bacteria and fungi. And we'll figure out a new kingdom lives on this planet because back in the day there was not six kingdoms, there was two and then there was three and there's four, there's five now there's six. And we think biology's come to its end and there's six kingdoms. And I think I, my believe is that we'll find a seventh one. And with that, thanks for coming and

Speaker 10:         51:49          I appreciate you sharing my knowledge.

Speaker 2:          51:53          Tara, really quickly, where can people find you and more about your product and yeah, I, we have a easiest is actually if you're here, we have a shop on Abbot Kinney called the shrimp room that serves free beverages. I know to here at Google is free as well, but if you want to walk on Abbot Kinney, you didn't get a free mushroom tonic anytime. Um, we are also an all social channels, uh, at four sigmatic, f. O, u. R. S. I. G. M. A. T. I see. I'm a little bit hard to find, but I have a really bad Instagram called I am Taro that you're going to follow my adventures. I post rarely and randomly, sometimes good stuff, sometimes not so good stuff. So that's kind of where you can find us. But a stop by the Abbot Kinney, you can find us on whole foods Erewhon different places here in as well. If you want to buy it, Amazon foursigmatic.com we'll figure it out. Anyway, thank you.

Speaker 10:         52:47          Sorry.
