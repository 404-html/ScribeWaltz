Speaker 1:          00:06          Right. Today we're delighted to welcome Mr. Roger L. Martin to Google. Ah, Roger is currently a writer and strategy advisor, uh, and he's the former dean and current director of the Martin Prosperity Institute and the Michael Leach in Family Institute for corporate citizenship at the Rotman School of management at the University of Toronto in Canada. Prior to that, he was at monitor company, a global consulting firm based out of Cambridge, Massachusetts for 13 years as a director and is ultimately co-head of the of the firm. Mr. Martin is a frequent contributor to the Harvard Business Review, uh, and was recently placed third on the thinkers 50 a by annual ranking of the most influential global business thinkers. He has published 11 bucks, the newest of which she is here today to discuss titled Creating Great Choices, a leader's guide to integrative thinking, uh, which this Justin, uh, has been recognized by. 800 CEO read is one of the best business books in the leadership and strategy category in 2017. Please join me in welcoming to Google. Mr. Roger L. Martin.

Speaker 2:          01:19          Thank you very much.

Speaker 1:          01:21          Thank you for joining us. Oh, it's a pleasure. Uh, so I'd like to begin by asking you, so, so you developed the theory of integrative thinking 15 years ago. Yeah. How did the idea come to you and, and what is it in its simplest?

Speaker 3:          01:35          Sure. Well, in its simplest form, it is the notion that when you're faced with an either or choice or it seems like you can only do one or the other thing. What I found is that highly, highly successful leaders take that as a sign that they shouldn't choose or compromise. It's their job. They're leaderly job to come up with a, with a better answer. And the way I got interested in it was Detroit. I was really interested, you mentioned monitor company and, and a bunch of business school buddies. Uh, myself, a couple of professors thought the world needed another consulting firm and we, we sort of called ourselves internally were sort of young punks consulting, uh, because all the Mckinsey and Bain and BCG people were much older than we were. And I was exploring the question of why on earth did clients hire us and for what particular kinds of things?

Speaker 3:          02:29          And, and what, what I found was that they, they hired us for that sort of problem was when, when they were facing a kind of a big either or choice, it wasn't like, were we need to improve our marketing or we needed it sort of, boy, we can do this. So we're going to do that. Uh, and, and we're a bit flummoxed. And, uh, and so I just started observing how they thought and how the most successful of them a thought and came to this conclusion that the only thing I could figure out that was consistent across the really highly successful leaders that I interviewed was this one thing. And, and the tricky thing was I first looked at what they did and what I, what I found is that there was no commonality in what they did. I, um, and it was because they had a completely different context.

Speaker 3:          03:22          So I, and so I interviewed all of these highly successful leaders, you know, Jack Welsh and Michael Dale and Bob Young and, you know, Izzy sharp funder, four seasons, et cetera. Um, and, and I couldn't figure out something that they did that was similar, but I realized it was so context specific. And Jack Welsh was an interesting one for me because early on and Jack Welch at the time is as CEO of Ge, he said to all businesses, unless you're really big, unless you're number one or two market sharing in a divest you, they all thought he was fooling cause it never happened in the history of Ge. And he had divested about a third of the portfolio. Uh, and uh, but then later on in his long tenure as CEO, he basically told his businesses the opposite, which is be small. He said, do not come to your strategy review with me defining yourself as any bigger than 15% of your market.

Speaker 3:          04:19          Uh, and you could ask why. So those are like the opposite. Define yourself as small or, or a a defined yourself as big. And the reason of course is early on he was at, had the problem of having a really messy portfolio that he needed to clean up later on. He was worried about growth and was tired of the jet aircraft. People coming in and saying, Jack, we've got 70% market share already. There's no growth there that yeah, that might be of a building and selling engines. But if you add in leasing sales, uh, repair, trading, all of that, you've got five percentage share, shut up and get back to work. Um, so be so, because, because there wasn't a pattern of doing something similar, I started, I started asking him is there a thinking pattern? And I, and I, and I started asking them, what are the five hardest decisions you've ever made in your life?

Speaker 3:          05:12          And came to the conclusion, uh, that what, what made them successful was not accepting tradeoffs. Just refusing a and saying there's gotta be a better way. And then, so 10 years ago you wrote the opposable mind, what was the idea of that dog? If it was, it was to describe that phenomenon and give examples of, of highly successful leaders who faced what appeared to everybody else to be an either or choice. And they did something different. So when related to your, you know, if the world you're in, Bob Young, cofounder of red hat dominant Linux software, he faced the challenge of are we, you know, uh, there's two things I could do. Free software, which is what he started in, in, in, in red hat or proprietary software. And he liked how much money proprietary software companies like Microsoft, uh, made, but he hated the fact they wouldn't give them this, a, the customer that source code.

Speaker 3:          06:12          So it wasn't modifiable. He loved the free software part of it, which is you give them the source code and they can do whatever they want with it. Felt that was, that was kind of better for the better for the world, a better for his customers, but he needed the fact that you couldn't make a buck in it because anybody could put together Linux, uh, compilations. And at that point, the way you, you may, you the business, uh, in 1995 when he was making this decision was to settle, shrink wrap disks for 15 bucks by mail order. Joe, what do you do? Free or proprietary? That was the, the, the choice he faced. Everybody else shows free or proprietary. Uh, he said, I don't like that. And came to the, came to the conclusion that out of the proprietary model, what he loved was service contracts.

Speaker 3:          07:03          You made a lot of, you could make a lot of money on, on servicing the corporations that used your software with updates and aversion control and all of, all of that. Um, and what he liked about free was, uh, was giving them the source code that the clients, the customers could do with it. What they, what they wished didn't actually like selling short, grab this for 15 bucks a mail order. And so as he thought about it, he realized, actually, uh, there could be a way of getting the thing I care most about, about free, and the thing I care most about from proprietary, which was his innovation, which just say, here's, here's the deal. I'm going to make this the first software that's downloadable, free off the Internet. We will get dominant market share, will be the only Linux, a company that big corporation to will trust and will make a will.

Speaker 3:          07:54          Uh, create a big service of business doing that. That would be the classic kind of integrative thinking, a kind of choice that I talked about in the 2007 bucks. So you, you've expounded the theory of integrative thinking and the opposable mind, what new value does creating great choices, spraying it explains more how so what we, what we got that mean the 2007 one ended up being a bestseller and it was all great and everybody said, wow, that's great. That gives me sort of hope that I can do something better. But people struggled with, uh, well, exactly. Roger, how do you do that? And we spent 10 years after figuring out what they did, uh, experimenting with how you could teach somebody how to do it. How exactly did they do it and how could somebody who might not naturally be great at this or have experienced in this could do it so that creating great choices is the, is the distillation of 10 years worth of experience in the how. So it's more like an a manual that says if you want to do this thing, if you buy the premise of, of uh, the opposable mind and you want to do this thing, here's how you do it.

Speaker 1:          09:07          Yeah. It's very, very much a how to think, a methodology of thinking. Why do you think that's necessary?

Speaker 3:          09:13          Well, you know it, I probably got smacked on the head enough times by my most beloved academic mentor. His name is Chris Argyris. These are the passed away a couple of years ago after our long, almost 90 year life. But he would say to me when I worked with him was Roger Action and upon which you cannot take knowledge upon which you cannot take action is barely worth having it all. And what he said, his criticism of much managerial advice is the moral equivalent to grow taller, be smarter, whatever. And everybody's like, I must tall as I'm going to be. I haven't trying as hard as I can, you know, think harder. Well, I'm thinking as hard as I can, all of that is not helpful. So I have a sort of a high bar myself or unless somebody can walk away and do the thing I've told them to do, I might as well not have told them in the first place. It's just an irritation. They all, they'll get their hopes up and be unable to do it. And so that was the integration when people said, I love this Roger. Aye. I, I, I love the examples you give and I love that goal. You know, how do I do it?

Speaker 1:          10:24          So if we look at companies today, yeah. The way they make decisions, there are certain best practices. What in your opinion is, is lacking?

Speaker 3:          10:33          Yeah, I think most of the best practices in decision making are closer to worst practices and best practices to be honest. I mean, uh, they're, they're, uh, I think people, uh, in making decisions, uh, converge too quickly on a, a solution that seems fine, rather than choosing a stepping back and saying, I'm going to try for something better. Um, I think, I think a lot of decision making is there, I say here and Google plex to analytical. Um, it, uh, uh, this great decisions, uh, our creative, uh, by their nature. Uh, and, and so I, I often see people saying, well, we've got a decision to make. Let's crunch all the data in order to make, make that decision. And what's the problem with crunching data? What from what era is 100% of all data from what era? Yeah, the past. So can you crunch data to figure out something that has never happened before?

Speaker 3:          11:46          Can you, you know, like, no. In fact, if you crunch data from the past, you will convince yourself the future will be an extrapolation of the past. And I'm like not the clever guy who thought this up, right? Aristotle is the, is the man, uh, in the fourth century BC who explained this to the world. And the world is largely ignored Aristotle, right? So he explained that there are two parts of the world, uh, in one part of the world. Things cannot be other than they are. That's what he said. Fine. So if I fall off this chair, I won't fall up. I'll fall down. And even if I do that a million times, I'll fall down. That's part of the world where things cannot be other than they are a, and he said in that part of the world, he invented the scientific method. It was formalized 2000 years later in the scientific revolution by Descartes and Bacon and Newton and Galileo.

Speaker 3:          12:44          But he laid out, here's how you use science to demonstrate. He said, the Pr, the unqualified purpose of science is to demonstrate that things cannot be other than they are. So he laid that out. Uh, and he said, if you're dealing with the part of the world where things can not be as in, they are, be scientific and analyze the hell out of it. That's rigor. But he said there's another part of the world where things can be other than they are. Like consumers have never ever, ever used one of the devices. It's in everybody's hands as of 1998. Right? And now they can't live without them. Well, that's the part of the world where things can be other than they are. And you know what? The world's first scientist and the most important scientists in the history of the planet said in that part of the world, do not use science. Do not. Instead in that part of the world, rigor means imagining possibilities and choosing the one for which the most compelling argument can be made.

Speaker 3:          13:50          Uh, the world. Listen to Aristotle about science and then ignored his warning about the limitations of science. So the biggest complaint, I mean there are exceptions. Google, apple, Facebook, Amazon. But the biggest complaint of fortune 500 CEOs now is, is I can't find enough organic growth. That's my big problem. And I'm more worried about two kids in a garage who I don't even know exist yet than I am about my biggest competitor across across the street. That in my view is not uncorrelated with over the last 50 years, management becoming science and, and, and analysis obsessed.

Speaker 3:          14:39          Because if you're a science obsessed and you're, and you're crunching data about the past, eight will tell you a new thing can't happen and won't happen. The data shows that it won't then two kids in the garage and make it happen. Or Two kids in a PhD program, uh, at Stanford and make it happen. Uh, and, and then all the companies that we're sure it couldn't happen because science told them it couldn't, uh, are wondering what the hell just happened here, right. Like all advertisers other than Google or Facebook or wondering like, uh, you know, what, you know what, uh, what happened here? There are analysis showed that what's happening here could not happen. So that's a bit of a rant, but that's, that's, that's my number one, the number one problem with a management decision making in the modern world. It under values, imagination, and then wonders why it doesn't come up with new ideas.

Speaker 1:          15:32          Yeah. I just, I want to pursue that tangent nationally. It sounds like you have a very polymathic way of thinking about business. Where does that stem from?

Speaker 3:          15:41          I guess, I mean, I've always been accused of being as sort of a business philosopher. Uh, so maybe it's just, I've always, I guess I've always wanted to understand why, why business works and how to understand aspects about business that aren't readily understood or are confusing to people. Um, so for instance, this one came out of me, me, he's trying to answer the question of why all these CEOs who I work with, because I worked with a whole bunch of big, big companies, CEOs saying, Roger, we're spending more on innovation and getting less. I can't figure this out. What's happening? And then these people who don't have anywhere close to the resources we have are producing more innovation than, than we are. So, so, so I try to figure out, figure out mysteries, um, and, and give people better ways of thinking about the mysteries of, of business life.

Speaker 3:          16:41          And, and uh, it turns out, I think that that to figure those things out, you typically have to step outside the strictures and frameworks that you've been taught. So if I tried to solve the problems of the business people who I deal with by applying what I learned at a business school, and I went to a perfectly good one. I mean they're all, there are, lots of them are good ones, but I went to Harvard business school and if I just applied what I learned at Harvard business school to solve these problems, I couldn't solve them. Lots of them. Most of them. It's because what it seems to require is stepping outside the strictures because often the strictures and question, you know, created the problem in the, in the first place. So I guess, I mean it is a good question. Nobody's asked me that before. Uh, but that would be my best, my best guess at an answer.

Speaker 1:          17:34          Thank you. Um, so when you're developing the methodology for the book, yes. Did you come across any surprises or were there any sort of Aha moments? Yes. The biggest surprise to knock me over with a feather surprise

Speaker 3:          17:47          was that what figured out, uh, by, by studying all of these integrative solutions is that none of them came from the most commonly used approach to creating innovation. What kind of piece of paper do you start out with to get a real innovation? What kind of a blank one, right? Get out a blank sheet of paper, throw out everything that you know and that'll give you the best chance of an innovation. It's a cool theory, like it makes a whole lot of sense. You're unconstrained and did the DA, all that, all that stuff. It turns out that in no case of any highly successful leader who came up with an integrative decision that I studied, it doesn't mean they don't exist, but I couldn't find one actually came about there. They're innovative breakthrough idea from a blank sheet of paper. They came to it by mining opposing models, so Bob young would say I needed to have a true understanding of the free software model as it existed in 1995 and a real understanding of the proprietary model and why it was successful to come up with a solution and that solution.

Speaker 3:          19:08          As I say it, my definition of integrative thinking is when faced with a, with a opposing models that you've come up with a creative resolution of the tension in the form of a model that contains elements of each, but it's superior to both. And so that you can knock me over with a feather because up til up until the time when that became evident to me, you know, I just said, hmm, interesting. I was in the camp. Have to free yourself up and be more innovative. You get take up blank sheet of paper now. Now instead what I say is you have to fall in love. Absolutely fall in love with the two models sequentially fallen in love with the first one. And the cool thing about the first, you know, falling in love is right. What happens when you fall in love with somebody, you accentuate all their good things and focus entirely on their good things and act as if nothing else in the world exist.

Speaker 3:          20:04          Do we do we all recognize this? We've all fallen in love. Okay, so it's cool. And so I say do that because what matters is mining each model for the good things. Forget about the bad things. Who Cares? Who Cares about that? You don't want any of those many ways. So don't even think about them finding good things and then forget about it and fall in love again with the other model and, and figure out what are the good things there and then figure out a time or way to put them together. And in doing this and doing this, what we learned just through trial and error is to push the model's farther apart to the absolute extreme. Uh, you know, so if you're gonna, if you're gonna say, oh, we have a problem with is should we, uh, you know, leadership development in our company, should we centralize it all?

Speaker 3:          20:52          And you're right in, Eh, you know, here or decentralize it around the world, people would be inclined to say, well, a more centralized or less centralized model is, let us look at those two. No, no, no, no, no, no. Model one, every last single thing and decision is made centrally. There is no central training function. It doesn't exist. It is completely dispersed. If you do that, you have a better chance as it turns out of coming up with an integrative solution, then more sensible. Yeah. Kind of sensible models. Uh, somewhere in between. The reason is there's not as many raw materials in those compromise he type models because the enemy of integrative thinking is compromised. Hate it. Worst thing, nobody's happy. Everybody's got to like medium sad, right? Nobody's like Super Mad and nobody's super happy. I hate that. I want delirious this and that. Turns out for that.

Speaker 3:          21:45          That was another thing that was a surprising fine. The other thing is, and the thing is kids can do this. Uh, we, uh, we had a great, a Rotman Grad who was the director, Dan sort of academic vice principal of a girls' school, a girls' high school. And uh, and she said, you know, we, we want to try this integrative thinking thing with our great 10 girls. Those a Ib school, International Baccalaureate School. So in grade 11 and 12, you do the two years of the ID and so in great to Ng said be good. It would be good saying, uh, to do, uh, for grade a grade 10 girls in the spring of grade tend to be ready for granted. 11 and 12. I said, okay, you know, I'm game for anything. Taught them integrative thinking. Cocurricular was, you know, outside school for noncredit 22 girls, they're all keen on it.

Speaker 3:          22:39          Gave them a project similar to the project we gave the Mbas and their answers were every bit as good as the Mba answers, which, which gifts you, I mean, like that sort of, whoa, wait a minute. So the Mbas have, have at least six more years of formal education read 11 grade, 12, four years of Undergrad. And some of them all already have masters or PhDs before showing up at minimum of six and they have four and a half years of work experience. So 10 and a half years, a decade of life experience. And they're no better thing. So we must, we must damage them in ways we don't understand so that they have to recover to get back to the same level. But that got me, uh, which I think is absolutely the case. And so we now have a huge program that's the apple of my eye. I think this is the most important thing we do for k through 12 and we teach integrative thinking now to five year olds. We teach the content of that book to kindergarten kids and they're great. So that was, that was fun. Who Does it? Who does not get, but there they're great. They're as good as a graduate students. Okay.

Speaker 1:          23:47          So yeah, the, it seems like when we were, when we, when we seem to think that there's only two options, that's something that's almost conditioned. Yeah. Other than,

Speaker 3:          23:55          yeah, we are conditioned. We are conditioned to say a tough guy or a tough gal when faced with a big choice like that knuckles down and it makes it, the kids haven't been trained that yet. They sort of say, I don't like that one or that one much. You know? And, and if we say, well here, it would be a methodology for getting to a better one. They're like, give it to me. Let's go, let's, let's do it. Or as Mbas to a much greater extent. Or like, you know, in theory that might be nice, but it's about making tradeoffs. That's job tough job buck stops here. Interesting thing is all these super highly successful, uh, leaders said, basically said integrative thinking is, is, or, you know, a trade off is my signal to not choose a, and Alfred Sloan, the legendary guy who built, uh, uh, General Motors in the 2030s or forties, that by far the biggest company in the world and the most successful automotive company in the world, it's great quote where he, where he's quoted as saying, and this is by Peter Drucker who studied, who studied him is after a meeting.

Speaker 3:          24:58          It was gentlemen, and because they were all gentlemen then gentlemen, I see that we've come to agreement on this important decision. Uh, I suggest that we terminate the meeting, uh, now and come back only when we've, uh, had time to develop some constructive debate. So it made Alfred Sloan junior very worried and nervous when all of his executives quickly came to a solution, uh, because he just needs it. We probably haven't come up with the best one. Uh, yeah. And, and, uh, and that, that is easier for kids to absorb. And for, for adults stoves or,

Speaker 1:          25:38          yeah. So the message is consensus is, is actually a bad thing. And you, you make an interesting point in the book where you say that a different idea, even if it's wrong, still has value. Yes. Could you maybe talk a little bit?

Speaker 3:          25:50          Yeah. I mean, what, what I, what I try to do now in my, my life is even when I think I've got the right answer, I say I got to try and come up with a different one, even if it's bad, even if at the turns out to be a bad idea to see if there's something I'm missing. There's a component that I could add to my model that is sort of inconsistent with my model. Like, I wouldn't think of it on my, on my own. But if I had this, this other model, I might think about it like this. What are the examples we use in the book? It's the Toronto International Film Festival, which is now the most important, uh, largest dollar volume, more deals done film festival than any in the world. Here's handling the director of it. Loved, loved, love. The fact that it was a very community oriented film festival.

Speaker 3:          26:36          Anybody in Toronto can go and see the movies, you know, during the film festival, just to all the movie theaters, uh, open themselves up to show these shows. You can buy tickets. It's very inclusive. There's no jury that decides which is the best. Uh, the best film he loved, loved, loved, all of that. Uh, but the only thing he didn't like is that they almost went broke every year. It was hard to be sustainable with this model. And so he looked at con, which is the absolute extreme other model. Totally exclusive. You can't go to con unless you were invited. And that's because you're a star. A director of, uh, producer, uh, or, or the like the show 15 or 20 movies, and there's a jury that decides who's, which is the best films, which, which Pearce says, I hate that. It's so elitist. It stands for exactly everything that I stand, a stand against, uh, et cetera.

Speaker 3:          27:31          But he would be the first to say it's the only one I studied con that I figured out the secret to making tiff, which when he took over was the third best film festival in Canada. Montreal was better. Bamf was, oh, it was better. I was in the, on the mountain, so it was irrelevant little film festival. Um, he said, the one thing I love is the sponsorship revenue that they get from the global buzz that comes from having a prize and heavy. Who's going to win the Palme d'or that brings everybody all the stars there, which brings the media there and they get all this buzz and then everybody, you know, Evian or crystal wants to have a bottle of their, of their product in front of every starlet when they're interviewed and it goes, goes global. So he couldn't, what he would never have been able to figure out.

Speaker 3:          28:20          The clever solution, clever solution for him was, uh, what's interesting about the Toronto International Film Festival to the industry. People have to buy their tickets. And it's Toronto, which is whether you, you know, it or not as the most ethnically, racially diverse city in the face of the planet, of any consequential size. 50% of people in the Greater Toronto area have a foreign passport, America, the highest city in America, and all of America's, uh, in New York at 20. So it's sort of two and a half times more, uh, you know, kind of diverse than that. So what is cool about the Toronto International Film Festival audience? What is it leading global indicator? Because the people have to buy their tickets and they're only going to buy tickets to the movies that they're, that they're interested in seeing. And they are like a little bit of a, uh, a, uh, a amalgam of the world.

Speaker 3:          29:20          And so what's the integrative solution? People's choice award. How's it about this? We give everybody a ballot who buys a ticket and goes to a movie and they will decide, not some jury of elites. What's the best film? And then that film is probably going to do well. And so over the last 10 years, the average global box offer office of the palm d'or winner and con is 16 million. The average global box office of a people's choice award winner at tiff is 200 million. And those, those last, those last 10 years, the, the tiff films and had 69 Oscar nominations winning 23 of them con 11 nominations, winning one total Oscar, and in the last decade. So what he came up with was something that made, made it so that Toronto is the buzz of producing a, a place and all the sponsors want to be there. And so it's a wash and money success by being even more so, it's not a compromise, it's not a compromise.

Speaker 3:          30:37          He made it even more inclusive. Not only do you get to go to any movie you want, whatever you with your vote help to be the global arbiter of, of a, of tastes. And whoever wins. Now that the TIF award in September is considered the Oscar, a front runner, uh, in, uh, in the spring. But he couldn't have come to that had he not looked at the extreme model that he did not want any part of, not quite any part of, he wanted one little part of uh, but he didn't know what little part until he fell in love with that and said, how does that work? So I'd say that to any, anybody here in the room, if there's that model that you just said, a visceral level, say I hate that model. That's the opposite of what I believe in.

Speaker 3:          31:31          Take 15 minutes, 20 minutes, a half an hour to say how does it work as it did it produce the outcome it does. What are the little causal relationships that produce that, that outcome? Is there anything I can steal from that model? So I may still hate the model. Here's still really doesn't like can't con at all. But boy is he grateful to [inaudible] for having given them an insight that enabled him to turn TIF from nothing too incredibly important. So I'd like to go back to the methodology. Yes. Could you walk us through that? Yeah. So the, the, uh, the methodology is to, is to, is to first take them off, take the opposing models and push them to extreme. Uh, then it's to analyze how those models work. And again, this is from the mouths of Babes. What, what, uh, what, uh, the way we do it is, is layout how it works.

Speaker 3:          32:28          So the film festival, how does the film festival work for the various actors that community, the industry, the festival itself, and figure out how it works, what ways does it produce the benefits that it does? And out of the mouths of Babes, one of the kids we were, we were working with said, well, this isn't a pro con chart. This is a pro pro chart. Huh? And so now it's forever the, the pro pro charts. Great. Appropriate surcharge. And then ask the question and we lay out three integrative methodologies, uh, to, to find an integrative solution. One we call the the hidden gem, right? Which is the Bob Young one. I just want one thing out of this one in one thing. Out of this one, I'll throw away everything else. And, uh, and that's what'll that totally get me a solution, what we call that double down, which is what pierce did.

Speaker 3:          33:17          How can you take one model and push down harder on it to get the one benefit you want from the other model. So you keep that whole model but, but go take it to more of an extreme. So he made it more inclusive in a way that got them the benefit of the other. And then the third is it something we call a decomposition, uh, which is which, which is if you want to use, uh, ag Lafley kind of creating with colleagues, creating connect and develop at p and g you say, and he was faced with a do either may, uh, spend less on innovation because we're not profitable enough spending like we are on innovation. But uh, but then that'll make us less innovative. Do we spend more on innovation and just say it'll come, it'll be fine. That's an either or. And he says, it feels like an either or when you think that it's about innovation. And he decomposed it and said, no, no, no, no, no. It's about invention and commercialization and invention turns out to have very little scale benefit.

Speaker 3:          34:20          Being bigger doesn't make you more inventive, per dollar spent. In fact, there's more and more data to suggest that it makes you less. So something for Google to think about it. Um, but commercialization is heavily scale sensitive. If you're proctor and gamble, you can get a hundred percent retail distribution of something almost immediately, uh, and you know how to brand it. And you can market it a, and you get the best advertising deal deals in industry cause he spent $10 billion in advertising. So what he said is if I decompose the model into two pieces, not innovation but, and commercialization, I can apply one model to invention and one model to commercialization. And the intervention model is I'm going to connect and develop. I'm going to, I'm going to tap in to the whole world of little inventors and be the best place for them to sell their, their invention or license their invention that will double the pipeline.

Speaker 3:          35:11          So we'll have twice as much stuff going through our commercialization pipeline and will, will dramatically improve our, our, uh, our innovation. So that's the third, the decomposition. So we say, try each of these vectors, try and find a hidden gem, try and find a double down, try and find a way to do a decomposition. And then the fourth step, that's the third step. And the fourth step is to prototype your idea that we really believe in sort of the, the design thinking oriented rapid prototyping because you're going to be trying something new. Right? And the tricky thing about new things when you have to use imagination and all you have is a compelling argument is they can be wrong. And so it's better to prototype them and also that way you can improve them and make them better. So that those would be the four steps. Take the models to the extreme, figure out, do the pro approach to figure out how each of them work, explored the three pathways to integration, prototype your best, uh, best solution and go and my experiences, you can always come up with a better answer and either or, or just a plain vanilla, the guy hated compromise.

Speaker 1:          36:24          So you consult many fortune 100 companies and probably many other companies. Uh, how is this methodology received when you, when you approach them with it?

Speaker 3:          36:34          You know, it's, it's received pretty well. I mean, several of our, of of my big clients like Dow Jones, 30 size clients are, are training people up on, on this and saying, this is how we've got to, this is how we've got to come up with, you know, can have better answers. And to a certain extent, this is how we've got to deal with bigness. I mean, there's a challenge to being big and still being creative and you guys would know it here. I mean, um, you know, it, it, it's, you have to I think go to more extreme lengths to continue a culture of creativity as you get bigger. And so a lot of these big companies are trying to figure out how can we make people on a daily basis be more kind of innovative, more, more creative in their work and not just hive it off and say, you guys are going to just run the machine and these few people over there are going to be creative.

Speaker 3:          37:28          Let's have everybody be creative and you're in sales, right? You know, sales is a daily integrative challenge, right? You would like to sell them the most standardized thing for the, for the highest margin than they want the most customized thing for the lowest margin. Right? It's pretty much like, I wanted it to be perfect for me and I don't want to pay much for it. Right. So you've got an integrative challenge every day and the, you know, mediocre salesman. I would, I think either are insistent, no, it's going to be my way or the highway. And so a bunch of a bunch of customers say, you know, I'll pick highway, uh, and then you sell some, or you compromise somewhere on the line in between those two things you do. And the great salespeople are the ones who say, here's the way to get what you need and to get what we need integrative, different, different way. So I'd rather have, if I'm a CEO, I'd rather have my salesforce be creative and, and bring creativity to their, to their every day and to say there'll be bog standard and they'll just follow us a formula while I'll have this small other group over there doing all the innovation. I'd rather have everybody be innovating every day. And this is a methodology for everybody innovating every day.

Speaker 1:          38:52          So it seems to me that, uh, this exercise is rather a rather rigorous, uh, activity, sort of mental exertion. So how, uh, how frequently do you use it? How frequently are you to use it? And is it something that sort of becomes more second nature over time?

Speaker 3:          39:13          It does. It does become second nature. There's no, no question. It does. But what I say when I say is, is, uh, um, if you don't have a hard choice, don't, uh, youth as the youth as if this, if like, you know, nature would you feel some pain? Nature's telling you stop. Right. Don't keep doing that. So do something else. Like take your finger off the hot hot stove. Um, I would say the same thing here when you feel the pain of Ah, ah, ah, I don't know. I don't know which to do because I don't like either. I would love to see, and everybody's had a little red flag go up and you say, ah, this the time to stop and think a little bit differently about think exactly the way I thought that has gotten me to this point. Having of having that conflict. Otherwise just don't just do you go about your daily life, but I love this little red flag. Oh, that's a trade off that I don't like. Could I do better? Can I do a lot better? What would meet up, pay off to do a lot better and then take the inspiration, uh, to do it. Um, and what about situations where you have to

Speaker 1:          40:30          under pressure, like very quickly make a great choice? Can you apply any of the theories in this book? Tuition?

Speaker 3:          40:36          Yeah, I think so. And we have a great case in the first book where it's a, it's a multibillionaire who had between close of market on day x. It was like a Tuesday and open a marketing on day on Wednesday, uh, to make a decision that it would have either made them probably a popper or turned out to make him a billionaire. So I dunno, that sounds like a decent amount of pressure, right? Um, and not much time, right. It's between five and nine. Uh, and he's got to make it, and I think the reason he's a billionaire is he didn't compromise or didn't choose either or he came up with, with a different answer than anything that had sort of presented himself. Or people had said, Gee, Michael, you gotta you got to decide, uh, kind of now, now, now, now before the market opens, we have to have a decision for sure.

Speaker 3:          41:30          Or it'll be, it will be completely too late. So I never believe in thinking that, um, that you should use time as an excuse. I think you should just be realistic. Michael, uh, needed to have a decision by 9:00 AM on Wednesday morning and he used, I don't think he slept much that night. Right? So he said, well, these are 12 and 14 hours or, or less. I bet I better, I better, uh, a better use them. Well, 16 hours, I guess I better use them well and uh, and used them so, so there, there's eight people I think in the world and the business world let themselves off the hook way too way too many times. Oh, management would never allow that. My boss would be so mad. You know, I don't have enough time. We don't have the resources lab lab of lads, just like one list of long, long list of accepted the managerial excuses. And I just, I don't accept any of them. Never have any and kind of never will. And I have it in my own life. I, you know, I eat the dog food. I've, my, you know, my career is a, is, is a series of, of making integrated choices rather than accepting the choices that I'm presented. Okay.

Speaker 1:          42:48          So you've had a really interesting career that's spanned several, several industries and areas, I guess, um, private sector, academia and now consulting. Uh, I wanted to zero in on the moments when you decided to switch tracks. Was that something that came to you instinctively or was it more of a rational choice?

Speaker 3:          43:10          Oh, it's, uh, depends what you mean by rationality. I guess the way I, the way I made my first big switch, which was a, a decision to switch countries and take a 94% pay cut, uh, was, uh, was when the president of University of Toronto, who was on the board of a company I was consulting to, uh, decided that I would make a good dean of his business school and proceeded, he's very persuasive guy, rob Prichard. Uh, and, and uh, you know, he persuaded me now he wasn't dealing with a sort of a completely blank slate on that. I, I had always felt that if you do well in business, you should turn yourself, turn your mind to public service at some point. Public service writ large, not elected politician. I mean public service and, and, uh, University of Toronto, like all Canadian universities as a public university like Berkeley.

Speaker 3:          44:07          Um, and, uh, so I, so I, I thought of that as public service. I was, had been living in the United States for a quite a long time. I'm a Canadian as you can tell about all my weird words. And so it was going to be public service back in my whole home country, uh, because I believe that Canada needed one great business school and it's zero great global business schools at the time. I felt it needed one. And, and, uh, I guess I managed to convince myself or rob convince me that maybe we could, we could, uh, do that. And sure enough, we did a, and you know, when I finished that 15 or 15 years later, I, I realized I missed, I did some consulting all along the way, but not much that I missed it. I love, I love advising CEOs on strategy.

Speaker 3:          44:56          And so I just said, I'm done with that. I'm going to go down to halftime. Uh, I'm going to run a research center, the Martin Prosperity Institute that you talked about before, or I'm trying to work on this tiny little problem of how to fix a, the future of democratic capitalism, which is kind of fun. Uh, and then consulting, I'm more, and so there is what I'm interested in and worried about the future of democratic capitalism don't like the way it's headed. Um, and so let's see if we can fix that. And, and uh, doing the thing I love, which is helping CEOs have better strategies. So I've always believed the guy, I was crazy. Folks who, who built monitor company believed that if you make better strategy choices, you use the world's raw materials, labor and capital better, and you make the world a better place. And I still, I still believe that if you make bad strategy choices, you just waste raw materials, you waste labor and you waste a capitol and that's, that's bad. That's not, you know, not good for the world. So I'm sort of pursuing pursuing two loves now, which is sort of public policy about something I worry about and, and engaging in activity that I find it rewarding and I think useful for the world.

Speaker 1:          46:06          Okay. So last question and then we're going to open it up to the audience. Yeah. Um, what's your, what's your Daily News Diet and if you, if you, I'm curious if you, you allocate any time for people like Aristotle air or day card and your habits.

Speaker 3:          46:24          I think I have very bad habits. I don't read much at all and I don't spend much time listening to the news. So, because like I, I, I think so what I do is I, I immerse myself in a world I care about the world of business and I try and solve problems for people in business. Uh, and that gives me all sorts of raw materials to write stuff that I think is generalized, generalizable, Lee, useful. Cause people say, how do you, how do you rate so much Roger? You know, even when Lou, you're dean, you wrote all these books, I've written 11 books, you've written 25 HBR articles, you've written hundreds and hundreds of other other owning. How do you, where do you get your research ideas? And for starters, I don't think of myself as doing research. I think of myself as doing, I like to do stuff, I fix stuff and then I try to figure out what I've learned from fixing that stuff.

Speaker 3:          47:23          And then when I, when I come up with, come up with a problem in my mind then and only then do I read stuff that, that I've been told by somebody or I've come across that I think might be useful. So I'm like, I'm reading voraciously, everything in complexity theory right now because I think, I think we've a problem in the economy of thinking that we're going to produce a kind of normal outcomes and everything is going parade. What's changed the economy to make things go parado. So I've got to read all the complexity theory stuff about that, but I don't read complexity theory and say, how can I apply the complexity theory? I say, how has anybody thought about it from a different field, stuff that might apply to this field, uh, right here. And then I, then I dive and then I'm veracious than I have the excuse to read. And I don't mind reading for some reason. I don't love reading. I love writing. I did love, love, love, love writing. Uh, and so that gets me inspired to read. And I think that's a very, it's like seems bad. It seems bad behavior to me that I don't read. Read more.

Speaker 3:          48:44          Great. Well I think we'll take some audience questions. I'll repeat the question. So do you think machines will be able to think integratively in the future and are they already doing it? I doubt they're doing it and it's part because it kind of, humans haven't kind of organized the thinking enough on this. So I mean the, the, the way I think about it, and I wrote a book in 2009 on this, if this, if you're interested, called the design of businesses is, um, you know, kind of all knowledge on the planet goes through through three major stages. Everything we know now about the world was once a mystery, you know, why do things fall when we let go with them? At one point it was because of a love for mother earth or animal spirits or whatever. It was a mystery, right? And then, and then we, when some of these things, we think about enough that we reduce it to a heuristic.

Speaker 3:          49:39          So an apple falls in the head of a smart guy and he says, ah, there's a universal force I'm going to call gravity that pushes everything down. Then if we study at uh, hard enough, long enough, some of those things get reduced to an algorithm. If you drop an item anywhere in the world when America, it accelerates at 9.8 meters per second squared because America is exceptional. That's 32 feet per second squared here. Um, and, and so it's an algorithm and once you've got something to an algorithm, you can, you can, in the modern era, this is what's different about the modern near than any year before is once you've got something, you, an algorithm, you can, you can code it and shove it through a, a digital computer and do it perfectly fast, et cetera. So, so for, for, for, for me, the enabler for machines to do things is pushing things.

Speaker 3:          50:30          I call that the knowledge funnel, uh, down the knowledge funnel. And I don't think, I think integrative thinking is a heuristic at this point. It needs to be made more algorithmic for machines to be able to do it. And how far that can go. I mean, there are, there are some things that have, that have allowed themselves to be reduced to code more quickly than other other things. Uh, we haven't figured out, figure out a bunch of bunch of things so that, so it sort of a dependent would be my, my view. Um, I somehow think that, that the notion that machines can get ahead of human beings, uh, on the distillation of knowledge, um, I'm, I'm probably, uh, from Missouri on, um, but there would be other people who would disagree and say, Oh, yes, they will. But that's, I'll, I'll believe it when I see it.

Speaker 1:          51:32          How do you deal with, uh, what seems to be a mutually exclusive choice where integration is,

Speaker 3:          51:38          it's more difficult. That's what this technique is for. It's what for what appears incommensurable choices. So I, I am not a believer that, that the choices we feel are mutually exclusive are as mutually exclusive as we think they are. They're mutually exclusive only as long as we think of them the way we do. And, and, and, and one way that causes things to be mutually exclusive in our mind is abstraction. We abstract up to labels that causes us to believe something. Two things are mutually exclusive, free or proprietary as how can we be free proprietary? Like it can't bigger, smaller. How can you be bigger and smaller at the same time? You can't, you can't. But it turns out that those labels often are abstractions that aren't helpful to our goal, which is to get a better answer than those two. So when I tell people is, is, you know, don't live in the abstraction, the answers, the integrative answers lie below the abstractions in the mechanisms by which you get to the abstraction.

Speaker 1:          52:53          Are there areas where this type of thinking will fall short?

Speaker 3:          52:56          I mean, I haven't seen them yet, but they're, there may be, uh, once, I mean, I guess in, right? Like in the course of human endeavors, right? I, I think we, like, we've manufactured the world that we, that we live in. It's not as unchanging as people think it is. Uh, and most, most times when we seem to have an either or choice, it's, it's a function of believing in that it is, and a function of living in an APP, in a world of apps of abstraction. So I haven't seen a domain where I can say, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. In that domain, you just can't, it's just, there's, there's no, no, there, there, I mean, there are some domains that are tougher right? You know, wars are fought on, on the basis of absolute religious beliefs. Right? Um, and people could say, well, you know, those are, those are, those are the either, either, either or is there, but they're just, they're either or is only as long as we, we produce the either or and we produced the either or by abstracting up to things that appear to be so contradictory, nothing could ever, ever be done.

Speaker 3:          54:13          Uh, I just, I just haven't seen ones where if, if the people involved value at better answer, not a compromise, a just plain better answer. Right. Tiff is more inclusive than when then that when a fierce handling started and more important and richer and has bigger buzz, then con that you'd think that's impossible. How can that be? Because con is exclusive. It's a nasty, elitist, exclusive thing. Well, get below the label. All right. Well, thank you, Roger. Thank you everyone for [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          55:01          You're welcome. [inaudible].
