Speaker 1:          00:00:06       Yeah. My name is heath row and I'm research operations manager for the brand studio of Google. And we're here today with Jason Calacanis. Jason is a technology entrepreneur, angel investor and the host of a weekly podcast called this week in startups. He's the founder of a series of conferences that bring entrepreneurs together with potential investors. And he was a scout for top tier silicon valley venture capital firms, sequoia capital. He lives in San Francisco, California. Used to live down this way in southern California and is author of a relatively new book. It's about a month old called angel, how to invest in technology startups, timeless advice from an angel investor who turned $100,000 into $100 million published in July by Harper business. I've known Jason for probably 20 years now. Haven't seen him for ever and a day. So it's good to have you here, Jason. Thanks for having me. Heath. And we were journalists together back in the day that we were covering technology.

Speaker 1:          00:01:04       Well, let's start theirs cause I first met you. It wasn't photocopied when I met you, but silicon alley reporter you went on to digital coast reporter web blogs, Netscape, Mahalo. That journalism is all generally focusing on the gathering, curation and promotion of ideas and powerful ideas. Yeah, I was, I'm lucky enough to be in New York when the Internet hit in 1994, 95 CD roms were becoming a big deal and multimedia. And then all of a sudden the Internet became commercialized with the Netscape browser supporting images. And I started a Zeen Chris back then too, if you want it to be important in the world, the real startup idea you had was the xen and xen just meant a magazine that was not professionally produced, but that was literally a photocopied. And so after starting that photocopy xen silicon alley reporter, it quickly grew into a print magazine and have 300 pages and I got caught up in the whole.com sort of wave of innovation.

Speaker 1:          00:02:01       And so I got very lucky. But being a journalist is a great way to learn how to interview founders and to cut through bs. And, um, you're kind of a detective, right? Like when you're a journalist, you have to ask questions, let the person talk and maybe try to figure out what the truth is. And when you're an angel investor, it's very similar. You're, you're talking to founders and sometimes they're tourists. They're people who are just trying on the concept of being a founder. They, they saw the social network or they, they seen how Uber or Google or Airbnb have grown and they say, I want to be a jerk, I'm going to be a founder. And then they start pitching investors and you realize, wow, this person's going to give up. This idea does not have real meaning to them and they have no idea how hard it is to be a founder.

Speaker 1:          00:02:43       So I think that journalism background has helped a number of people, including Michael Moritz, who was the original investor in Google, um, was a journalist and wrote a book actually about Apple, uh, back in the 80s. And so it's, uh, it's one of the great paths I think to investing is either being a founder today you can be a founder and then go on to be an investor or somebody in growth. That's another big one. Right now everybody's looking for growth hackers to become investors. Um, and then journalists, it used to be Mbas, so you have to go get a Harvard Mba or Stanford Mba and then you know, you, your fraternity brothers would get you into a venture firm. Now it's, it's really delightful that the whole model has flipped and it's like if you don't have operational experience, they really don't want you to venture capital end.

Speaker 1:          00:03:26       It used to be all venture capitalists had zero operating experience and they were all finance, you know, NBA Bros and all the firms were just groups of, you know, Harvard, Stanford Mbas. Now it's totally changed. They don't want to hire people without operational experience cause the founders can see through it immediately. They're like, you've never run a company and I'm going to take your advice. I'm going to take a pass on that. And what do you think caused that or what, what happened in the industry that, that led to that shift and thinking? I'm the founder friendly movement. I think, um, when a market gets hot and uh, really Sean part, I would give Sean Parker a lot of credit for it. You know, Sean Parker and Google, uh, and Michael Borowitz had a little bit of a back and forth over Plaxo back in the day. And he then brought Zuckerberg out to silicon valley and famously, you know, left sequoia at the altar and wouldn't let them invest because of how he felt he had been treated.

Speaker 1:          00:04:24       And then founders fund, Peter Teal created and, and Sean Parker created founders fund. And the reason they named it founders fund was specifically to attack sequoia and other venture firms and say, those firms are interested in kicking out the founders. These firms are interested in, you know, being founder friendly. And then that just changed everybody's thinking like we have to be founder friendly, you know, uh, and you know, there's pros and cons to it. Yeah. How do you balance that, the operational experience with a maybe an idea driven founder? Yeah. Um, it's pretty interesting when you look at the history of Silicon Valley. If you were to say I'm only going to invest in founders who have great experience, you would miss Larry and Sergei, you would've missed, um, Bill Gates and you would have missed Zuckerberg. You wouldn't have missed, you know, Uber or some other companies that had serial founders.

Speaker 1:          00:05:18       Twitter had a serial founder obviously and Evan Williams. Um, so a lot, there is actually a theory that the, the biggest outcomes are by people who are first timers. It's not actually backed up by reality. It's kind of 50, 50. Um, but the thing about venture capital and angel investing, and she don't have to hit everything. So if you miss Google and you get Facebook or you get Facebook and you don't invest in Google or we get airbnb and you don't get Uber, well you have to do is hit one. And then they let you write a book. I hit six UNICORNS, you know, in the first hundred investments. Now when I wrote the book and did the book deal, I had three UNICORNS and since the book came out, three of the other companies have tipped over into that territory. So it's a pretty good track record.

Speaker 1:          00:06:04       But you know I, the reason I wrote the book really is it's so opaque, the idea of being an angel investor in doing it professionally, but because of large the size, the scale of Internet companies now and the amount of wealth being created has gotten so great that now we went from just maybe 10 or 15 years ago, 10 years ago when I started angel investing, I started about seven years ago, but about 10 years ago when I was a founder raising money, there was only like a dozen or two dozen angel investors of note and you could kind of make the rounds very quickly. Now I'd say in Silicon Valley there are 500 to a thousand people who do it as a primary activity. In other words, he spent 50% of their time on angel investing or more. So I think there's going to be a professional angel investing class.

Speaker 1:          00:06:50       The vcs have retreated and said, we don't want to take risk anymore. We don't want to do a series a that's speculative. Bring US companies because there's so many companies, they've moved down treme and they just bring us companies that have revenue and traction. If it's an enterprise company with $100,000 or $50,000 a month, we'll meet with them. If it's a consumer product and it's got 10 to 50,000 people using it in a day and you've got three to six months of traffic, we'll meet, we'll probably wait till you hit 10 million users a month before we invest and do a series a. But really that's opened up this huge swath of what I call the Goldilocks Zone, pre series a pre a venture capitalist wanting to join the board, but post the product being launched in the market because let's all face it, we know that you can get any product to market or I'd say nine out of 10 products, you can get some version of it to market for either sweat equity or a $100,000 or less.

Speaker 1:          00:07:44       Right? So if you wanted to build slack or Twitter or even Uber, you could do that for low hundreds of thousands of dollars. In other words, people can bootstrap it, friends and family, some close friends to get that Beta out. And that goldilocks zone is where I think a lot of wealth creation is going to occur in the future because you've removed the 99% of founders who never get their product to market from your investment criteria. And then you don't have the vcs in with their sharp elbows blocking the angel investors yet. And that's just probably a, I'll call it a three year window in most startups where angels can participate, there's probably about four or five rounds of funding in there as well. Uh, anybody here, um, have a friend who's actively running a startup and is raised money in the last 12 months or so, right? So almost half the room and if you talk to them, they probably will raise five rounds of funding before a series a, it used to be raised in angel round friends and family and angel or seed round and then a series a.

Speaker 1:          00:08:51       Now you raise friends, friends and family. Then you do a pre seed round, a seed round, an angel round, a pre series a, a series a extension. I mean they come up with all these crazy names for them, but just call them $250,000 to one point $5 million rounds. And usually there's six convertible notes converting when they finally get to series a, which means you can really take her time as an angel investor and get to know the company. There is really no need to panic and like I have to get in this round, you can actually wait and just build a relationship with the founders over six months, which is kind of what I outlined in the book is my theory on how to do it given today's environment, uh, which is there's a lot of startups and they raise a lot of rounds of funding and you really don't want to be investing in startups before they finish their product because it's a bit of a towel.

Speaker 1:          00:09:42       If you can't finish the product without raising a ton of money, maybe you're not an actual builder. Sometimes it's true, but most of the time you're not an actual builder. Yeah. It's 99 all over again. I mean it is highly tourist season right now. So the opportunity is still very great, but a lot of people are trying on and playing the role of founder and what they'll find is it's a really, really difficult job. It's very hard to be the founder. You don't sleep at night, you've got somewhere between six weeks and 12 months of runway. Your product is probably under assault from competitors and investors are waiting to see and people are deciding between joining Facebook or Google and getting huge RSUs are coming to your company and you've got to convince them and then they come for six months and leave. So it's, it's very hard.

Speaker 1:          00:10:35       And I think, you know, that's, that's one of the, um, the interesting parts of this is just trying to figure out who's going to stick with the idea. Because most days as a founder I would say are not super rewarding there. They're generally hard. The reward you get for being a founder of a technology company is you hire the smartest people you know, and they all bring you the problems. They can't solve that, you know? So like literally every week it's like, hey, we got all this stuff done, but here's what we didn't get done. Can you help us? Wow, that's challenging. You know, that's, that's Elan's life is like, okay, I hired the smartest people in the room and now they're, they can't figure out these things and I got to, you know, figure out how to get the model three out on, tie in and get the Falcon to land properly.

Speaker 1:          00:11:20       Right. It's a hard life and it never gets easier. So you mentioned sequoia. Do you still work as a scout for, so I'm still part of this request scouts program. I do like a investment once a year with them, but I just finished up my first proper fund. I had a $10 million Angel Fund, which was basically my friends, uh, and my money. And then, um, I'll do something in the future. Uh, you can't talk about those types of things, right? Obviously. Um, but one would suspect I'm going to stay in the game and do another hundred 50 investments. Uh, and then I'll me at 300 investments. It's very hard to scale angel investing. That's one of the things I'm trying to do right now. And part of the reason I wrote the book was I think there's a lot of people who have money in very boring asset classes.

Speaker 1:          00:12:05       I call a dead money. You know, you've got your money in bonds, real estate, you know, some equally balanced equities portfolio using Wealthfront, which is a great tool for doing that. I'm an investor in their company and so you have these, uh, you know, swaths of money that are sitting there and it's not kind of helping society in any way or changing things. I think people should take maybe 5% of that net worth 10% of that net worth and put it in something that's highly risky. It may not return, it may not have the stability of, you know, the stock market balanced portfolio that people talk about that returns four to 7% a year in doubles every eight years. But you have that outside chance of going in a hundred to one on an investment or a thousand to one which would then double your net worth.

Speaker 1:          00:12:49       So I think people are overly risk averse and I tried to outline in the book, here's a strategy, maybe investing in syndicates, people know Angel List or seed invest or I have my own syndicate. Now Jason's syndicate, people know that they can invest alongside of angel investors. That's a great way to learn how to do this. You're investing $1,000 or $3,000 in each startup and you do 20 startups. All of a sudden he's may have invested $60,000 total, but you've done 30 investments and you are watching the monthly updates of 30 companies. It's a great way to build a network and get in the game for what most people would consider the price of one angel investment of 50 or $60,000. So I try to outline all of that in the book of how to slowly learn how to do this. And I think it's probably the most exciting career you could have.

Speaker 1:          00:13:35       You get to hang out with the smartest people who want to change the world and meet them when they have, you know, one to 10 employees in their company. Right. It's pretty exciting, I have to say. And even if you lost half your money doing it, you'd be losing half of say five or 10% of your net worth the network and the knowledge you would build during that time would easily make up for that two and a half percent of your net worth. Right, right. Regardless. And you're, one of the things I liked most about the book was the kind of attitude of democratizing angel investment. You mentioned earlier today that you know there's a couple of hundred angel investors in the valley, but this is saying that grandma can be an angel investor, college student can be an angel investor. Talk us through some of the steps or the advice that you would give people.

Speaker 1:          00:14:20       So I think it's purposely opaque. We, we have a very unfair system in the United States where there's two classes of people, accredited investors and nonaccredited people who make over $200,000 a year for a couple of years in a row are considered accredited. If they have a million or $2 million in cash, you can look it up on the SCCs website. And then the other 95% of America are considered nonaccredited. But those 95% can go to Vegas and bet on a sports team or they can play in their local poker game or they can buy, you know, they can do whatever they want with their money. Um, using bad judgment, good judgment, et cetera. They could even buy stocks in the public market without having to check with anybody. But the idea of investing in private companies, which is where ultra wealth is created really outsized outcomes, is very, there's nowhere you can have these kinds of odds to get these kinds of returns except in Silicon Valley and startups.

Speaker 1:          00:15:14       So I think that we'll see that change. It's in Europe, which is interesting because it's a pretty protectionist kind of a vibe over there. Obviously they allow everybody to invest their money however they want. So here in the United States we have a little bit of a history of, you know, not trusting people with their own money, but that's unraveling. It's good intention. But now they have something called equity crowdfunding where sites like seed Invest in republic are taking companies and allowing them to raise money from civilians, nonaccredited investors for $500. So I look at it and say, you know what? I see people out there spending money on all kinds of dopey stuff. I think making investments in startups would be a lot better. And if you were to ask all of the Etsy sellers early Etsy sellers, hey, you're, you're not accredited, but we have, you know, 5,000 creators on the platform, you can each invest up to a thousand dollars in the platform.

Speaker 1:          00:16:03       How many of them would have done it? And what kind of wealth would be created? Ebay, same story. Think about all the adsense partners in the early days. If you had told me when we were in in gadget, is adsense going to work? I was like, well, we're making $3,000 a day off of it. You know, 10 years ago I would have made that baton but pre uh, public Google shares for sure, but that opportunity wasn't open TV than me. I wasn't accredited yet. At that time I was negative 10 grand actually and my bank account. So I was stuck. So I'm hoping that all changes over time. And since we, since I wrote the book, it's been 25 days, we had 1200 people in our Angel Syndicate and we've had 700 more join. So we're averaging something like 30 people a day applying and then accepting maybe half of them.

Speaker 1:          00:16:46       And so I think this is going to change in a big way. A company Cafe X, which I'm an investor in, which is a robotic coffee machine, um, who has raised to um, not equity crowdfunding but to syndicates of node, like, you know, upwards of $1 million from investors, 10 K at a time. Now we have hundreds of investors on that cap table under one umbrella. My syndicate and all of those people get to participate. I'm super proud of that. If I becomes a Unicorn and those people turn 10,000 and he goes a hundred x, I mean I would be super excited to see people become millionaires or to generate that kind of wealth. And I've seen it happen. I mean, in Silicon Valley, I see people who are pretty dopey, make angel investments and make millions of dollars pretty regularly, and it should be open to more people. And most people have a good eye for this.

Speaker 1:          00:17:36       If you were to ask anybody who was on Linkedin in the first two years who were recruiters or HR executives, those HR executives and recruiters who would normally not have access had the insight information. They knew that linkedin was going to become a very significant platform. The early creators on Youtube knew that it was going to be something special. It was obvious to them, but they could not participate into it. And Chad would have absolutely allowed youtube creators to invest if that was allowed. And that's what we're slowly starting to have happen. It started last June and it's been a year. The companies that are doing equity crowdfunding, I would say, um, are the Wa in some cases the ones that didn't clear market with venture capitalists and angels. But I think that's slowly starting to change where people, the scariness of doing something new like angel is syndicates was very new and people were very scared of it.

Speaker 1:          00:18:26       That's flipped over. So if everybody were to invest 5% of their net worth and startups, I think the world will get better a lot quicker. We create a lot more jobs and we say a lot more problems getting solved. So I actually believe that this is something bigger than just making money. I think it's making change in the world. If you think about all the great change that's occurred, it's because some angel investors supported some crazy kids who had some crazy idea, whether it was Larry and Sergei or chat and uh, the team at Youtube or snapchat and you know, they, they all needed some small amount of money to get going. And these experiments are worth trying and if you lose, you know, six, seven, eight or nine out of 10 bats in the last bad returns, more than 10 x, you're in the black.

Speaker 1:          00:19:10       Uh, and just as a gambler myself as a semi professional gambler, in fact like high stakes gambler in poker, like it's, it's very hard for people to deal with losing six or seven hands in a row. Anybody here play poker? Anybody here ever loose seven or eight hands in a row when they were the odds? Favor? Yeah. People are raising their hand. I mean, it's going to happen one out of every 500 games you play, right? Like when you're not ready for it, you stare at the ceiling and go, how did I lose all of those heads? I lost six hands in a row that I should have won. It's a very odd feeling. Uh, that's actually how the normal for angel investing if you're doing it right. Like when I introduced people to Uber 17 of 22 or 23, oh, only three people said yes.

Speaker 1:          00:19:58       Out of maybe 20 or 25 people I introduced them to and we're talking about the greatest investors in the world said no to Uber and they said no two or three times. Um, and I'm the three people who said yes, all have nine figure positions. Uh, and the people who said no, or some of them have 10 figure position, some of the people said no. Just every time they see me, the way I should have listened. And the list of reasons of why a startup will fail is very long. And the list of reasons of wildly succeeded, they're very short. And so what I've learned to do is work against my natural, you know, our biological nature is to be conservative as humans, right? If you were to swim across the river, the river might take you or the alligator might take you. Or if you go over the hill, the line might eat you.

Speaker 1:          00:20:41       We are conservative animals for good reason, but we don't need to be conservative in this aspect of her life. We should be risk taking, but risk taking is something that people just don't have in their DNA. Did you have to unlearn what your DNA is telling you. You should be taking this risk. There is no crocodile that's going to eat you. If you lose your 10 k here's gonna lose 10 K and make it back next month. So don't worry about it. It's fine to burn that 10 K it's a worthwhile risk and people overestimate the downsides so much. It's crazy. Let's, let's unpack that a bit. So when, when you're looking at an opportunity, what characteristics or qualities do you look for? And the question behind the question, what makes you push past that? Sure. Fear. Yeah. Um, so I usually do make that long list of reasons just to get it out of my system and then I just take it on our, cross it out or rip it up.

Speaker 1:          00:21:33       Cause I assume that a smart founder, we'll get through those and you have to ask yourself not what could go wrong, but what could go right, what could go right for the company and if those things are even a one in a hundred chance or a one in 50 chance of it going right. If the odds pay off higher than that, it's worth doing. And so that's Kinda how I look at the entire world right now. And I've had to, I've changed my whole thinking. I tend to bet on people. Um, and I, I'm good at reading people and I think the biggest mistakes I've made in investing, which were Tesla, Twitter and Zynga, I wasn't an angel investor at the time, but my friends were starting those companies and I could have invested in each of them and that would have been a $50 million return on average each based on the check size.

Speaker 1:          00:22:19       I was writing shortly after that. And in every case with Twitter was, I just thought Twitter was such a terrible idea because if it's, I sat there with Evan and Biz and I said to them like, they were like, hey look, just take her blackberry out and we'll text four oh four oh four and you say what you're having for breakfast and business is going to say what he's having for breakfast and fcs, what they're having for business. And all of our phones go off in the s it was an SMS service at the beginning. Yeah, there were no apps and I was like, Oh my God, Evan is Evan Williams. I was like, this is so stupid. Nobody cares what business having for breakfast or what we're having for breakfast and you just cost me like 4 cents. I'm going to run through my whole SMS plan and there's no blog post here.

Speaker 1:          00:23:02       You create a blogger. He sold it to Google, right? Like people wrote their thoughts. It was full thoughts and now you're saying just it's the same as blogger except without the blog post. It's just the title and now he's back to medium. Right. Well, and that was like, you realize that if this succeeds, it's going to be a cacophony of idiots. Like literally everybody who can't put together a blog post, which is only 400 words, they're going to write 140 characters instead of 140 or 300 words. Every idiot in the world is going to be on this thing all day saying stupid things and it's going to be getting magnified like grace. I was absolutely right and it costs me $50 million. So then I realized, you know what? I don't have to know this is if there, if there is Jason's law of Angel Investing, it's, I don't need to know if your idea is going to succeed.

Speaker 1:          00:23:45       I just need to know if you're going to succeed. So since I started that approach to angel investing, which is does this person have passion? Do they have skill? Do they understand how to build a product and a team? I look for those traits and when you ask people questions, short questions, what are you working on? Why will this idea work? Now has something changed in the world that makes this idea work now? Or tell me about the product design or why are you doing this? Just like literally pointing out one feature of the product. Say, wow, what is this syndication thing, this little snippet here on Youtube. Why is that important? Like, if you were to ask, you know, Chad earlier that it was like, oh, because people want to put videos on their site, there's no easy way to do it. They have to put up a server.

Speaker 1:          00:24:27       So if they would, if they put this javascript into their blogger.com account, they can put a video on their site. Oh, why is that important? Well, because it's free marketing for us. We're giving them free hosting a videos. They give us free marketing to their audience and we're going to grow the service that way. That was the why now, syndication and cloud computing. So I'm now, I now have three or four founders, um, who ha are creating products, um, that I invested in after investing in their last company. So Raul created a company called reportive that people may have used. That was that little sidebar in Gmail that told you everybody's social stats and this is their Twitter handle and here's a bunch of information on them. He sold that to linkedin. Now he's doing something called superhuman, which is like a better Gmail. I mean like, well anyway, I mean, I don't make anybody feel, feel bad in the room.

Speaker 1:          00:25:13       It's kind of like nobody's taken on Jean Allen a long time, rather it feels like gmls like it was so radical when it came out 15 years ago. So he's kind of taking an approach of uh, uh, the same approach that GML took towards the, of like a radical email client. And so when he sold reportive, I made two or three times my money and I told him, hey, this is fine. Like I, I'd rather we don't sell, but okay, uh, you're, you got four cofounders. I only ask one thing role, when you have your next idea, you call me and I can be the first investor. He called me, I put $1 million in, I joined the board, boom, we're off to the races. And this has happened like three times now where somebody who I invested in who got a single or double or lost my money, we come back, we do it again.

Speaker 1:          00:25:53       So I'm investing in the arc of a founder's career and I think that's the way that's in my mind, the best way to do it as if you know somebody who's a winner. If you know they work hard, you know they're passionate, you know they're not going to give up. These are the qualities of the founders who when they won't give up, they have skills and they have passion for the space. If an intelligent person wakes up one day and realize is how hard it's going to be and how much sacrifice there is and they're not passionate about with the idea, the rational thing to do is to quit and say, this is going to be too hard. You have to really, really care to blow up two or three rockets and still go to work the next day. You know, Ilan was, he's a close personal friend of mine and like when he blew up the second or third rocket, I mean it was, you know, I think that was, that pushed him to the brink.

Speaker 1:          00:26:42       I mean he was really, really focused, but he wasn't going to give up and he was it. It strengthened his resolve if anything. And now you watch these idiots on Twitter, Baxter, Twitter, cacophony of idiots like criticizing the model three for it being Mike a couple of weeks late or something. And Kenny hit the numbers. I mean like I was just driving the car for a couple of days last week. It's got 300 mile range. It's drives like a Porsche. Like these idiots are still doubting him. It's like, did you not, have you not been paying attention like these guys that it's like literally the, there were always these haters out there and doubters who throw rocks at these companies who are trying to change the world. And literally if Elon succeeds like no more smog, you know, energy independence from dictators who own big swats of fossil fuels, global warming, like a free transportation, eventually no more road deaths because of self driving.

Speaker 1:          00:27:42       Like there's this whole swath of incredible things that will happen. So it's so amazing to me how people could not be positive about what's happening in the world. We're trending, everything is trending so much in, in the right direction and there are small issues here on the sides that we have to solve. Some of them are big, but I look at them all as incredibly, um, solvable. Incredibly. It's solvable, including jobs, including, you know, environmental issues. I think we can solve all of them, which is a lack of, um, positivity and a lack of paying attention to what's happened to date. We seem to solve a lot of the problems that we face as humanity. If we are, you know, India fatiguable and clever in our approach and we're clever. We're clever species. Well, let's talk about the people building that better world because the book is written kind of in the guise of how to become an investor, but it would also be really useful to people who want to build a company that others would invest.

Speaker 1:          00:28:40       It is really about talk about that. Yeah. Well, as a founder, you know, everybody's trying to figure out how to hack investors. Like, I mean, the whole point of y Combinator for the last couple of years has been how to manipulate and get an edge on the investors. And I think it's the wrong approach. Um, I think they've realized it's the wrong approach because you're really in it together. You don't want to try to trick the investors. So people are constantly asking me, how do you get an investor to invest? You know? And it's like, well, if you have a great team and a great company and great product and customers who love you and some level of traction, you're going to meet a hundred investors, you know, and eventually six or seven of them will invest and then it's that simple. But they're trying to figure out how to hack the investment and instead of trying to hack the investment, how about hacking the usage and the engagement level of your customers?

Speaker 1:          00:29:29       So if you had a hundred units of work, this idea of spending 90 units on hacking me, investing investor community, which is a pretty sophisticated group of people to try and hack. Like, why not spend those 90 cycles trying to triple the engagement of your current customer base and then explain with the last 10 units of energy here, here's what we did to increase engagement and tell that story. So I think this is the rookie mistake a is just too much gaming of the investor community and trying to figure out how to hack it and what, what are they thinking? It's pretty simple what they're thinking. Does this person have the ability to build a team that can build a product that delights users and if they can get that product to market, you've, you've built that credibility. So and to think it's going to happen after one meeting is probably silly.

Speaker 1:          00:30:20       Like it usually happens over five, six, seven meetings and email updates. So I'm so a pro this monthly update that I require it from my investments because the first hundred investments I did, I didn't require them to send monthly updates. Now in my legal documents that require a monthly update that starts with the most important metrics, how many months of runway to have, how much cash is left in the bank. When do we need to raise money next? What's the revenue? What's the user engagement? And so I've been making this a requirement, uh, because so many founders don't send these updates and then they don't have the opportunity to raise money from the investors who they've already convinced to put money in because those investors lose faith. What I tell founders now is if you want me to invest, you know, so many deals coming at me right now.

Speaker 1:          00:31:05       Um, put me on your monthly update for three months. I'll read your monthly updates for three months before I invest. And then I'll decide like looking at your monthly update when it's right for me to invest when it's in my goldilocks zone. And so the best thing that founders can do is really understand what that investors invested in and what, what their timing typically is. There are investors who like to invest when the company's worth $1 million or $2 million before it launches their product because they're product driven people and they make products. So they want to be involved in the product creation and they want to be there for the day. It launches, there's other people who want to be there, you know, right after it launches like myself, like I want to just see six weeks of data. There are other people who want to see two years of data, you know, vcs typically, and you just have to know your audience.

Speaker 1:          00:31:50       Um, and so I get monthly updates more consistently in some cases from companies I passed on investing in than the ones I did invest in. Like literally I have somebody who was sending me legal documents to sign for an approval of a Silicon Valley Bank loan and credit facility. You know, when you're an investor you have to sign off on these future investments. And I'm like, I haven't heard from you in like 18 months, what's going on with the company? It's like explaining everything that occurred. I'm like, you could've just done this monthly like, or whatever and it would catch up. Yes. It's weird. Um, so I think the monthly update is, puts people on this cadence where they can build trust and build credibility with investors. And that's what you're really trying to do with those investors is just just trying to build this sense that you're credible and you're not stomping.

Speaker 1:          00:32:36       Like when people get the sense that like you're not going to give up and that this train is leaving the station and they can either get on it or not. That makes it a very attractive investments. Like this person's not going to give up. And that's a, at least you know that your money didn't get burned without people even trying. Right. Um, it's nice to know that people try it and I don't mind people losing the money. I mean, as long as they tried hard, that's really the goal. Okay. Um, you've lived in New York, you've got many, many years. You've lived in southern California, 30 and 10. Yeah. And uh, now San Francisco for three. Yeah. How do the business communities differ? How does being an investor in those communities differ? Sure. Um, you can build a great company in those three cities. No problem. I'm a great founder.

Speaker 1:          00:33:24       We'll build a great business in those three cities. If you're in southern California, over here in New York, you're going to have less competition as a founder for talent. Talent will stay longer, costs will be a third less. Those are all great things. You're going to have to come to the valley to meet with investors and those investors will not mind going to New York or Los Angeles because they're awesome cities. And if you were to rank the three cities, it's like New York's the greatest city in the world. Los Angeles is probably the better lifestyle. Um, and very similar to New York as people who have lived in both cities will say I'm in San Francisco is the worst run, great city in America. It's like just horribly run. It's a completely dysfunctional, um, and like can't even solve like minor issues. So, um, it's pretty, pretty tragic in a way.

Speaker 1:          00:34:07       But if you're a founder there, obviously you have access to more a wider talent pool. I wouldn't say necessarily better. Uh, but the costs are ridiculous now. I mean, it's really like show stopping lead bad. Um, so the, the high art I think right now is to put your headquarters in Silicon Valley in a we work office and then have everybody in Arizona or Los Angeles or San Diego or have your team at Waterloo doing your code and have a mail drop in the valley. Basically it's like having this little like headquarters and the valley until you can get some, you know, a valley vcs VC to put a series a and, um, your chances as an angel investor in hitting a Unicorn are greatly reduced outside of Silicon Valley. Just statistically, everybody knows that. And if you look at the hundred billion dollar out, the 50 billion or $100 billion outcomes, those are almost universally come from silicon valley.

Speaker 1:          00:34:57       You do have Amazon and Microsoft as the two notable exceptions, and you have snapchat down here, but snapchat might be a $5 billion company, not a $10 billion plus company. So what I say in the book is like, do to be a great investor. Do you need to be in Silicon Valley? It's the answer's yes. Now you could go there. So I lived here and was going up there weekly. Um, and that was a lot of work. Um, but that, that's how I did investing and I hit a four of the six unicorns doing that. So it just going up there and going up for two days, three days a month, you have a chance to just book all your meetings and, and get it done that way. So there's something very special about the, the community up there, but you see something very nice happening down here as well.

Speaker 1:          00:35:39       And I think the question is, will those people who make money off of snapchat or working for dollar shave club, will they become angels are not, and will they start investing in this community or not? And that's what happened in New York. You know, the, the silicon alley reporter days, there weren't that many investors. Things started to work out and you had someone like Kevin Ryan from DoubleClick who had made a ton of money, launched business insider, um, and uh, a DNS company work. I'd CDN company, can't remember the name of it. That did very well. And he also did a flashlights out, so he was just investing in everything there. Um, and, and you're starting to see that cycle. I think actually lear hippo, Erica Poe was at Ziff Davis in New York and then they did lear hippo and they started a venture firm that invested in buzzfeed and Huffington post and all that kind of stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:36:25       So you see that renewal happening, new firms and new individuals in those cities. So, uh, Stockholm is another crazy example of nine unicorns out of Stockholm. That's crazy. How'd that happen? But I've been asking for an explanation. Nobody can give it to me except that they worked really hard over there because there's no sunlight long. Lynchers lat long winters, they just like worked for 12 hours a day. But you know, there were nine that came out of there, which is pretty, pretty amazing. Um, so innovation can come out of any place. How are things going here after the memo? I'm curious a lot of talk about that or no, wait was like, I was like, what should we talk about? They're like Google memo, Uber and benchmark. They like it was all the controversial topics. Well, to a, to side step that question entirely. Go ahead.

Speaker 1:          00:37:07       Let's talk a little bit about it, about growth and optimism growth and on what, what areas do you see a nascent opportunity? And we've talked a little bit about free energy. We've talked about robotics. Yeah. Uh, well, you know, in our industry we always have false starts. And so if you think about Vr as an example, uh, how many people will remember VRML the virtual reality markup language? Like there was like, literally we, we're going to go through the Jaco index and be like flying through in three d and like picking arts and leisure or photography nudes, you know, whenever I'm like pulling out the folders and it was going to be this incredible Gerald linear world and, um, it never happened. And now send you put an Oculus on and you're like, wow, that's incredible. But still hasn't happened, right? Like when is that going to happen?

Speaker 1:          00:37:52       Exactly. Um, VR VR might be a false start right now. The headsets seem extremely expensive and it might still be four or five years away. Before we have 100 million people using it, right? And you really need to have tens of millions of people to possess the technology in order to have 10 million use it in a day. And that's when you sort of hit this tipping point. Now ar feels a lot closer, right? So that, that's something where it feels like you could have 10 million people a day using it, you know, two years from now. And so I do think there's something there with ar and Vr, whether it's two, three, four years. So that would make it a good time to start investing. But people who invested two years ago and VR companies, those companies are running out of money right now. And they're desperate because they thought they would be selling $5 million worth of software apps and they're selling 50,000 a year.

Speaker 1:          00:38:38       And it's, you know, like really early adopters. Ai was when we had a lot of false starts on and now it's not a false start. So I've been pitched on six or seven companies that are taking AI into Schuman, resources, customer support, legal, um, and it's pretty obvious that like, I dunno, 60, 70, 80% of legal docs that have been created, you should just be able to be like, okay Google, I need a nondisclosure with Jason that says this, this and this. And then it's just like, okay, we sent it over to him and then I get an okay, I sign it and boom, like we, we could do most contracts that way. Uh, and so white collar jobs like that I think are going to be at risk in the next 10, 20 years because it's going to be so easy to do things like contracts, uh, or accounting, you know, these kinds of things are ais for real obviously.

Speaker 1:          00:39:29       And you guys all know that from deep mind and the impact that's going to have, and that's a horizontal impact. So when you have something like AI and machine learning hitting at this pace and people learning about it this quickly and implementing it, tensorflow, all this other stuff, like it's getting easier to implement Watson, etc. So that means you're going to have a whole group of entrepreneurs being backed by angels to try to, you know, we do every vertical to make an AI. And if you enabled, if you look at Google photos, I think it's a great example. You know, Google photos is just anticipating what I want. And I don't know if anybody works on Google photos here, but high five. Um, do you guys uh, crushing it? I mean like, I'm like a download Google photos from my phone. Like for a year people like, you have to get Google photos on your iPhone.

Speaker 1:          00:40:16       I'm like, no, I don't. I already, I got Icloud, I'm paying for it. And then I get Google photos. I'm like, oh, that's pretty dope. Like, you know, it's telling me like I should check out these photos and it's like telling me like, look here, we made a video for you because we know you like videos. It's kind of scary. Like it's figuring out what I like and I'm delighting me every day and it's obviously juicing machine learning and AI to figure that out. And it's going to only get scarier and better as time goes on. So I think that's pretty, pretty real. And I think robotics is the one that was another false start. We had all of these Roombas and segways and other, you know, robotic ish devices, hardware devices that we're going to change the world and didn't. Um, and now I have uh, two startups that are using robotics in a way that um, our as truly disruptive.

Speaker 1:          00:41:03       The cafe x one is a robotic coffee machine that maybe you'll see here in Google one day. Um, I wouldn't be surprised if you saw it here. Um, and uh, it's to coca cola machines wide. It's got the arm and it makes your coffee and it makes it perfectly and you can order it on your phone. It knows the distance you are from the machine so it makes your coffee and under 60 seconds it gets it perfect every time it remembers your last instructions. I want this type of milk. I want this type of being, I want this type of caffeine. I want this temperature. Like you can really dial it in. You pick it, you go, it enhance it to you. It takes under 45 seconds. Uh, and so the idea of waiting had intelligentsia, if we're sia for how long to get a coffee, that's about 20 minutes.

Speaker 1:          00:41:45       They have the same intelligency or beans in their machine now and you'll be able to every airport, every two gates, there'll be a cafe x machine and it will cost one third less to get a cup of coffee and it will take 19 or nine minutes left. Everybody's been in that position where there's like a line for coffee and you just give up. So the idea of people making coffee for a living and a robot should be doing that, right? It doesn't make much sense unless you want to have like the charming experience of a Barista with suspenders and a big mustache. Um, that'll still exist somewhere in the world. And then this other company, lockable is making modular housing and they're going to use robotics. So you can be able to take out your phone or iPad and be like, I just bought this lot over here in Culver city and I need a house that's like this dimensions and I want to have it delivered.

Speaker 1:          00:42:29       And the robot's going to make it. So like prefab modular at Yahoo that made housing. Yeah. And so it may be the same price, you know, two or three or $400 a square foot, but it may take out six months or 12 months of time to build a or, and then eventually it might cost last actually two. And were my quest, you know, 10, 20, 30% less. But the time savings will be where the real savings is and then they might have four of those factories. So depending on where you're living in the country, you know, it could be conceivable that you order out, uh, a nanny unit or an in law unit. I think they called them in the back of your place in Culver City and you know, it's outside your house in two days, two days are the addition, you laser cut the new door, boom.

Speaker 1:          00:43:12       And then like literally at like the crane drops it in your backyard. So housing and coffee, you know, or like two areas where robotics specialized, they're going to do really well. So I really believe in looking at areas where we had false starts. Because if you think about, you know, going back to youtube as an example, there were hundreds of startups. I tried to do video on the Internet, but the reward for putting a video on the Internet back then was you would, if it went viral, you got a $5,000 bill and then you do the video got turned off. I mean, some people in the room might be too young to experiences, but it was often that you would go to a website that went viral and it would say this wet, this user has used up their bandwidth cap and therefore you can't see the blog post.

Speaker 1:          00:43:55       He couldn't afford the video accessible. You couldn't afford to be successful. And because of cloud computing, just, you know, uh, Steven and Chad had this like vision, like, wow, it's cheap enough or we're kind of in that range where we can kind of let people host for free. The idea that you could put a video online without putting your credit card, Ian was kind of crazy. Now it's like four k video uploaded to Google free forever, upload it to Itunes, almost free forever. Like as we've come a long way in 10 years. Uh, so I like to look at those spaces where people try, try, try. I tried and that's one of the things that investors totally by and mess up. They always look at their personal history and knowledge of the space and they correlate that with, you know, oh, it hasn't worked before therefore work, I mean, Google was the 11th or 12th search engine. It was just 20 times better. Like page rank was just that much better. The algorithm was the why. Now this is like a very complex algorithm that really made the results Germanna Chablis better. Um, and

Speaker 2:          00:44:58       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:44:58       somebody's taking another swing at bat at an idea that, you know, became 100 million or a billion dollar company is worth it. And we saw that with, you know, web van versus now instacart and other all Google, Amazon prime. Now Google has an, I don't know what it's called in. I don't know if you have the Google delivery here to have the Google shopping express up here or is it just in San Francisco? Tier two. Yeah. So like all these things that we're using now, ubereats and Postmates, like these were things that were tried cosmo urban fetch, a Web van and now just gps, logistics, robotics. All of this stuff has gotten so much better that it's actually working now and they're going to figure out the unit economics and it's, it's gonna change the world again to replaying the hype cycle for new appetite and new timing.

Speaker 1:          00:45:45       Yup. New Position. Look at gaming. Like we had this whole thing on web gaming. We're casual. Gaming was going to be a big deal. And then all of a sudden Facebook came out and social gaming was a big revolution. That apps were a big revolution. So you keep having these games, you know, waves coming one after the other. And I think we'll have that for ar. I think there'll be an ar gaming wave that'll be just crazy when you can put glasses on. I'm like, we're all playing like paint balls, Zombie paintball around the office for an hour. Exactly. It says some people with glasses on or like watching the zombies attack, like it's going to be a lot of fun. So I think there's going to be something. I think the ar stuff is the, is really interesting. That's super, super interesting. Can we open it to questions? Anyone have any questions for, for Jason? We have a microphone that they're going to throw the box at you.

Speaker 2:          00:46:39       There. It is sort of,

Speaker 1:          00:46:45       um, so you mentioned that, uh, you started off in journalism and then broken to investing and you were doing it long distance even from just looking valley. How did you break into the kind of, uh, bro Mba circles? Because I guess investing must be a pretty social activity. Yeah. Again, the sequoia had this idea that they're entrepreneurs where they invested in the, had invested in our company, Mahalo, which is now inside.com. Um, they thought that it would be really cool for founders to scout out investments for them. And that's actually how I did my first 15 or so investment. So I was kind of pushed into it by sequoia. Um, because they had this idea to do scouts, then they kind of created a monster and I started doing it on my own. Um, but now since that time I used to host something called open Angel Forum, which was just, I would have a conference room at a law firm or at somebody's house and invite 10 angel investors to see companies.

Speaker 1:          00:47:44       And actually thumbtack and Uber both came to open Angel Forum, which was Angel List, but in person. Uh, and so now angel list exists in these syndicates exist. The best way to break in is to just join as many syndicates that you can. Funders, club, Angel List SeedInvest and just watch the deal flow go by. And then you could do one of two scenarios. One, you could play fantasy sports where you read the deal memos and you'll say, I think this is going to work for these reasons. I don't think it's going to work for these reasons. And my conviction level is between one and 10. It's a seven. And so I'm gonna pretend I put in $5,000 and I'm going to remind myself every six months on this Google sheet to check it on the company's valuation. See if they raise more money and to see if I'm good at picking.

Speaker 1:          00:48:30       And you could do it in a moneyball fantasy sports kind of way, which is what I tell young people in colleges. You, you're just like creating a virtual portfolio. Um, but now if you have a little bit of money, I think doing this micro investing and putting real money on the table, we'll make your senses go a little bit. Uh, you know, just like playing poker for money changes it when you're playing for, you know, um, you know, pennies or f for fake money. So I like the idea of going to a casino and playing poker for a $1 $2 while you're learning, even though you're going to burn through a couple of hundred bucks, you're going to play these tournaments and you'll feel the sting of losing your 40 bucks. You need to have that pain. So I liked that pain for you specifically. You look like you need to feel that pain.

Speaker 1:          00:49:14       So I would say just go on Angeles. Join all this indicates, go on seed investor and all the syndicates and trust your gut. Make 10 bets of $1,000 each and see how you wind up. Now here's the secret. You know, you're building networks is not as hard as people think. If you do those 10 investments, you put $1,000 in each act as if you put 10 or $100,000 in, which is to say email the email the founder, introduce yourself, follow them on Twitter, favorite and retweet what they do. Look at their job board and check in with them every 60 days and say, how's it going? Is there any way it can help? And then find all your co investors in the company by looking at crunchbase or mattermark or any of the publicly available places, but that been a Google sheet and then email the hundred of them with a mail merge and say, Hey, I noticed were co-investors in Acme company together?

Speaker 1:          00:50:04       Was wondering if you had any interest in companies you're looking at? I'm looking, I'm breaking into angel investing. Um, and uh, I'm investing in this company next. So I started doing that in the early days I was telling people like, Hey, have you seen anything interesting? And little, I would do a mail merge like that where I would email 50 people and say, have you met any interest in companies? Like one sentence. And I would say half of the time people would respond and then some people respond three or four times. Yeah. Meeting with this company I met with that company. People are more than happy to share, share deal flow because in the early stages you need probably 30 40 50 investors before the company gets ready for a series a. So if you're one of the first 10 that means there's another 40 spots left to fill.

Speaker 1:          00:50:45       If you're investor 50 they might only be, you know, a couple of investments left. So that's how you build that network is you just email your co investor and say, we're co investors in this. That makes you, you know, like a family members. You're now on a first name basis because you're both invested in Uber together or this company together. And what, what other deals are you looking at? People really don't understand how easy it is to build a network in today's environment with all this information online, it's super easy. Does that mostly work when you get a hit? It's not really like your family? No. No, because it's sort of like, it's sort of like poker. You ever get invited to a poker game and you're a bad player and you're like, why are they inviting me? It's like, oh, we need some map layers that they want your money, they want your money.

Speaker 1:          00:51:23       No, but also you need to fill a table, right? So we need to fill a table. Like we have a, we have a company cafe acts that's just starting. We need to raise $1 million. We have 400,000 in, we don't care what that next $600,000 is. When it's that first round. We needed to get that $600,000 so they can prove out in 18 months that this is a possibility that they can build the machine, that they can get to $1,000 a day and profits, whatever it is. And so again, most people overthink it and the whole industry is cracked, wide open because of Angel List and seed invest. And the reason I wrote the book was really to try to inspire people to get involved in it and not overthink it. Investing and losing 1% of your net worth. If you learn a ton. It's going to be well worth it in my mind.

Speaker 1:          00:52:07       A quick followup. If you try to tie on overthinking, do you try to time it in terms of, well, this thing, uh, there's been not enough false starts quite yet, or there's this paradigm shift and I really should be looking in this direction or, yeah, don't overthink it is what I, I think because to the Twitter example, I didn't, you know, I, I, I understood it could become a huge cacophony of idiots yet I miss the obvious. If it does, who cares if it's a, if they're idiots or geniuses, whatever it is, it's a big thing and big things in the world generate tons of wealth. And this thing also in addition to being a place for idiots to spew hate is a place where revolutions can start. Right? So you're saying that if you don't personally like something that shouldn't be a barrier toward, I think you have to stick, let go of your ego and what you think of the idea and what you think of the, uh, possibility that it could work.

Speaker 1:          00:53:02       Now, if you're offended by the existence of something that I don't think you shouldn't fast, you're not enthusiastic. But I, I'll give another example. I didn't have a chance to invest in Airbnb, but I thought when I heard the airbnb idea, I literally said to people, they were like, yeah, you let, you can rent your couch. It's like couch surfing, so you let somebody sleep on your couch. And I'm like, like a serial killer. So like I led a serial killer sleep on my couch. Or like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. They're all like, it's a community. And I'm like, I've serial killers. And they're like, no, it's not like you could or you could stay on someone's couch for like 50 bucks or 30 bucks if you go to, you know, if you couldn't afford to go to Paris, you could stay in Paris for 30 bucks.

Speaker 1:          00:53:36       That's like on a serial killers couch. Like how many people here have stayed in an airbnb? Raise your hand if you stayed in an airbnb. It's everybody. How many people have hosted somebody as an airbnb host? Raise your hand if you've ever done an IRB house. One person. Okay, how do you do? I could net, I could never have somebody in my house who I don't know and do this. Like I'm just not brave enough to do that. And sure enough, I was like, like how do you stop a meth head from renting a place and just carrying it to the ground and ripping it apart and having a meth party. Like sure enough, like year two of Airbnb, it was like there's a meth party at this woman's house and they took all their photos and they made their own collages and put like kill everybody on the walls.

Speaker 1:          00:54:14       And it was like the most horrific horror movie ever. And I was like, Yep, just like a hotel room. I was like, oh, I see. I overthought it. Like everywhere there is a, there's 20 meth parties going on right now in hotels in Los Angeles. We not aware of them, but this is what people do in hotels. There's not parties going on I guess. So like it's of course it's going to happen in Airbnb and there's whatever. So you have to be able to like again, right? The long list of why it's not going to work is that there's going to be a math party or somebody in to tragically, uh, you know, a ride sharing service is going to flip a car and people are going to die. Like, or an airplane's going to die. You know, people are going to die in an airplane.

Speaker 1:          00:54:53       I just couldn't get through it in my mind. So I think sometimes taking yourself and your understanding of the issue in the market out of it, and just looking at the founder, are they passionate and are they making a great product? If they're able to make a great product and they're passionate and they're smart, well, if the product doesn't get that uptake from users, they're probably gonna pivot a bit and figure out another product. Whereas a team of idiots who have such a great story about how big the market is, but they can't build a really great product, they're not going to succeed. They're just not going to succeed. Cool. Thanks. I think you have a question here. In the other hand I'll do shorter answers. What about the people raising money with virtual currency? Now it's a great question. Um, I have looked at the companies and I would say the first wave of ISOS are extremely scary.

Speaker 1:          00:55:43       It reminds me of the.com bubble. So I'd be very careful. People who have crazy ideas have not built them. Raising 30 million or $100 million is a recipe for disaster. Um, in the height of the Dotcom boom, we had people raising money or taking companies public based on the idea that they would raise $100 million and then figure out what to do with it. Right. There was a company called Cmgi, I remember that was like an incubator and all these companies were going public with the idea that they would create companies. She had people who are creating ICO for products that don't exist, that are crazy ideas. We'll one of them work. Sure, we'll 99 of them fell probably. And so I, and then where's this money coming from? And this money is dark money from, I think the crypto boom. So people have a ton of a theory and we're a ton of bitcoin.

Speaker 1:          00:56:31       Like, okay, I will diversify it. So I'll buy all these ICRS. It feels like the ultimate Ponzi scheme to me. It's real technology. It could have a real impact. But this early cohort, I would not be surprised if almost all of them went to zero and all of that money got burned and there were massive lawsuits around it and that there was massive fraud occurring. Right now. I believe Bitcoin is probably, uh, one of the most massively manipulated currencies in the world where most manipulated things in the world. What's to stop somebody from creating 100,000 wallets were 10 of us from creating a hundred thousand wallets each and moving a bunch of bitcoins around, uh, and making it look like there's all this volume and then making the sh the share price go up. Like there's a lot of ability to manipulate anonymous currencies and um, the sec is not very, uh, we talked a little bit earlier about non accredited versus unaccredited.

Speaker 1:          00:57:25       Like the SEC. They do not have a, um, a, uh, what's the right way to say it? They're not looking for creative solutions, uh, to be put into the market with people's money at risk. They're risk averse, they're whole reason to exist is to protect people from losing their money and being tracked. These things seem like people could get tracked and can lose their money and then a lot of people are like, it's not an offering it, it's not like a stock offering. And then the people buying it are buying it. When you asked them why are they buying it, they're saying because it's going to go up in value. But if they're, if the people buying it believe it's a security and you are pretending it's not while you're cashing in tens of millions of dollars, this is I think a disingenuous. So some people who are taking in the money in, I know a are doing things like I'm paying taxes on it saying it's future revenue form software because this our API calls or whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:58:22       So they're actually going to pay their taxes on it, pay as if its profits against software revenue. So I think that's smart. Um, I do think that the fund, having a venture fund where the LP interests, the limited partners are in coins and are on a ledger is inevitable and that people will then be able to trade their interest. So if you were in the sequoia fund with Google at the IPO or right before the IPO and you want it to sell your shares to another person or you're a benchmark right now in the Uber situation where Uber and benchmark or fighting, if Uber, if benchmark shares were freely tradable and the lps could trade them well they might liquidate right now or they might be wanting to buy from another party. Right? And so you'd have this more fluidity. So I do think that that will come very quickly, like two or three years and other countries are going to lead it because we are very conservative when it comes to this.

Speaker 1:          00:59:11       So I think Scandinavian countries and Asian company, Asian countries and the companies are going to be very fluid with it. But I'm monitoring it because you know, if you are a fund, if you have funds like I have had or have, you know, it's a, it's an interesting concept. I'm, I'm certainly a believer in the technology, but I also saw a lot of companies I think in that group that I just thought they could not clear market with the venture community. Now it doesn't mean the venture community is perfect or the angel community perfect, but they tend to know what they're doing and that machine is a well oiled machine that knows how to take risk. So if there, if the well oiled machine of Silicon Valley and venture money and angel money passed on investing in these companies and then they were able to raise from dark pools of capital of unsophisticated people, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:00:03       I don't know if there's that much wisdom in crowds. I'm very worried about it. I think we have time for a couple more questions. Do you have a question? Yeah. Uh, I actually had a couple, I'm the first one was, um, on average, how many of your initial investments significantly change product direction? Um, at like prototyping stage or initial customer base. Um, and then another question would be on, um, how many investments have you made or how do you usually see where you're investing in someone who's a, also like for example, like working at Google but has legal, uh, acceptance to work on a product on the side or maybe any of the big five and that have, uh, have, have done very well those companies and they let her on quit of course. Um, and then maybe just how you see in terms of a silica, US Southern California, excluding silicone valley, where do you see southern California against, uh, the other, uh, cities in the u s yeah, so we, we talked before technology and talent can come from anywhere.

Speaker 1:          01:00:59       So I don't think, um, and I think southern California is so close to silicon valley and the people in Silicon Valley, especially investors and people who live there are kind of tired of silicon valley. It's, it's pretty horrible to live there right now because of cost, because of homelessness, because of crime. It's much better to live here, uh, to be honest. Like it's a much better lifestyle, like five times better. So I think you have a lot of them who are moving down here. Uh, and a lot of people who are willing to move down here because it's literally like, it's like a borrow, right? It's a one hour flight. Um, to your question about people doing their side hustle, I think most investors like to see a clean break because they want to know that you're all in. So I generally don't invest when people are doing those kind of side hustles.

Speaker 1:          01:01:43       Uh, even if they have permission, we want to get a clean break. No, you're full time on it and then make the investment but willing to meet and see the prototype. But I've been in a lot of cases where people have those side hustles and they've got permission from their manager and then the big five company is like, yeah, we're going to pull you back in cause we kind of liked your side hustle and let's get that back in the company. So because those big five are so competitive with startups now and aware of the startup ecosystem, um, I think a clean break is the wisest way to go if you want to raise from serious people. Um, and most companies pivot here and there. Um, the term pivot used to mean taking what you've learned and changing your direction slightly. One foot staying where it is and then you're moving around.

Speaker 1:          01:02:30       The word pivot somehow meant dropping the existing idea and coming up with a completely different idea. That's not the term pivot as we all use it, but people are like, we're pivoting and pivoting now in silicon valley means this fouled. Now we're doing this. That's not pivoting. Pivoting is we were going to go, you know, and do video for the enterprise. But then we found this new class of prosumers so we're kind of going to make it pro-sumer where it's free for most people and paid for the elite people. But it's not going to be an enterprise video solution anymore. Cause we, we, we realized the enterprise, you know, they'd like to roll their own. That would be a pivot. You're staying in the same vertical, you're shifting the customer base a little bit, but the product and everything is in the same zone. So that happens in almost every company where you learn as you go.

Speaker 1:          01:03:17       It's very few get it right. And in fact if you look at Uber like is going into ride sharing and Uber Pool a pivot. No, but maybe in the classic term it was, we started with black cars, Lincoln town cars, expensive cars. We pivoted to ride sharing like we added it, you know, we, we folk, we moved our focus over a bit to it. Um, so I think it depends on which definition of pivot you're going with. Um, but you know, there, there are people like Stewart Butterfield who did, who did flicker after doing a failed video game and did slack after doing a fail video game. I mean, basically if he had, if he does a v another video game company, I'm investing, it's just for the pivot, really good video game. The video game will never be released and $1 billion company will come out the other side. That has something to do with the team that's building the failed video game. Like the second he succeeds at a video game, I'm going to be worried. All right. Is the felon back still here? It doesn't look like he is. Um, I think that's all the time we had for questions. Thank you so much. Uh, if anybody wants me to sign their book, I'm willing to do that as well. All right. Thank you very much.
