Speaker 1:          00:06          I'm really delighted to be here and uh, hope we can have a dialogue, uh, after I speak a little bit about my book. Um, so yeah, far from scaring you, I think I want to reassure you initially that creating a is really something that we all do every day of our lives. It's one of the most fundamental biological processes. And to frame that, it's pretty clear that there's hardly a condition and the course of your day that you encounter that's fully predictable or predicted, you encounter it and you act in a fundamentally creative way. You go right there, you go left. And that may be a trivial creative act or a consequential, a trivia creative act. But in any case, it matters to you in the moment that you do it or you wouldn't have done it. Occasionally those creative acts lead to creative things and those created things may be anything from a well articulated sentence to a pure wet to a book.

Speaker 1:          01:04          And those things matter to you when you create them or you wouldn't create them. Now it has turned out to be in our interest to create not only for ourselves, things that matter, but also things that matter for many of those around us. The clan and the wellbeing of the clan tends to correlate with our own personal wellbeing. And therefore over time, our biology has pushed us to think about creating things that matter, not just to ourselves right now but to others and for a fairly long period of time. And so if you look over the course of human history at created things, whether it's an equation or a wheel, uh, these things have tended to, uh, involve of course, collaboration, a discussion, kind of figuring out what matters to the clan and pooling of resources. And, and when we finally made something, we've tended to make it to last, not just for the moment when we created it for some relatively long period of time.

Speaker 1:          02:01          And therefore villages and pyramids and shoes, uh, tended for most of history to last quite a long time. Fast forward to where we are today and we're in a moment that in a way is the pinnacle achievement of human creativity. And if you read Steven Pinker's recent book, clearly, uh, by most indicators, the human condition is better off today by human creativity than it ever has been. But one of the uniquenesses of our moment is that the created things that surround us are remarkably short lived. And the reason for that is a multiple, firstly among the things that we have a limited supply of his time and therefore in all of history when we have and have had a chance to create something a tomorrow versus creating something that matters to us the day after tomorrow, we sort of focus on tomorrow time matters. And over the last 300 years, and especially over the last 30 years, the power of science and technology has made it possible to create things of mass utility really rapidly.

Speaker 1:          03:07          And it's led to this increasing focus on creating things over a really short period of time. And that's skewed our perception of what creativity is and really led me to the writing of this book. It's also created, of course, this situation a highlighted by the United Nations and their identification of the 17 sustainable development goals of a world that is in a risk of, uh, no sustainability and therefore many today are focusing, whether it's on feeding the planet or saving life in the sea or preserving the environment in some way on creating over a long period of time. Now I'd like to just talk for a little bit about, uh, creating and this concept of learning. If you think about the sort of canonical, uh, creator environment, uh, you probably think about a scientific lab, which is indeed, uh, responsible for much of the, created a world around us today.

Speaker 1:          04:07          And if you think about what happens in a scientific lab, you probably have in mind the scientific method. And indeed, the scientific method is one of the things that goes on in a science lab. We tend to focus on phenomena whose laws we understand. Uh, we frame those phenomena in conditions that are really well specified and we apply the scientific method and we observe and to do so. And we make discoveries. However, in pioneering work, uh, in science and engineering and other domains, we tend to have either not perfect understanding of the phenomena nor perfect understanding of the conditions that frame them. And as much as analysis and deduction matters in the science lab, actually intuition and imagination matters too. And therefore the scientific process and science labs or an engineering labs and labs generally is a combination of the classical scientific method and what I call an artistic method.

Speaker 1:          05:04          It blends this induction deduction, a comfort with uncertainty and ability to frame a problem and move on into a single process that over the last 10 or 15 years I've been talking about as an art science process. Now, if you take the metaphor, the science lab and you apply it to your lives here at Google or to your personal lives, this balance of art and science still holds and there's probably a lot more art that, uh, is involved in science. And you can take any example. An example, for example, of losing your watch. You make a hypothesis that you're watching is under your bed. You then test your hypothesis by looking for, you're watching, you make a discovery and so on and so forth. And that's generally how we, uh, encounter, um, opportunity and a need in our lives and by this balance of art and science.

Speaker 1:          05:53          Now in my book, I talk about, um, this notion of an aesthetic work or aesthetics and a lot of thinking over the last century, particularly around aesthetics as being, uh, closely coupled with a kind of mindful way of living. And if you look at the most mindful of experiments, the works that come from those, whether it's a scientific article or a relief, um, can be thought of as aesthetic works. And I'd like to talk about aesthetics were aesthetic works just for a little bit. If you look over the course of history at, uh, things that we've made, um, through experimental processes, whether they're books or plays or, uh, reliefs, uh, they have generally invited a reaction from the public of observation, uh, and learning. Uh, and, uh, that has led to how we structure our universities, our museums, and even our companies and stores. If you look, however, at the last 30 years or so at cultural works and a works of technology indeed.

Speaker 1:          07:03          Um, as you produce here at Google, they invite a very different kind of public experience. This here is an image from Olafur. Eliasson is 2004, a weather project at the Tate modern. Uh, a kind of son was created and the, um, uh, Tate modern and, uh, people were invited to observe. And of course, nobody had any idea how people would observe an x to the, ended up laying on their backs and they ended up making formations. There's a whole story about how the weather project was a lived, but they became part of the, uh, the, uh, the cultural work. And that's indeed what's happened in technology in media. If you look at something like a smart phone, uh, as which invites me to engage in my engagement, changes the phone in a certain way, just as Google has changed by me using Google. And so there's this increasing participation of the public, uh, with the creator and we're all kind of creating a together.

Speaker 1:          08:03          And I say all of that just to say that the notion of learning, um, indeed, even of commerce as being one of a producer and a consumer is going away and it's actually has a radical impact and how we think about learning at Harvard University and ultimately, um, probably doing business. And so I've been focused over the last 15 years on the, uh, synonymous nature of, uh, learning, uh, about tomorrow and creating tomorrow. And, uh, particularly focusing on, among other things a little kids. My book begins with a story about a little kid. Uh, if you think about the ultimate pioneers, um, they are little kids, right? They're encountering conditions that are radically new and they are learning at an rate. And if all is, uh, particularly supportive, they're having fun. And so this is something that I come back to very frequently with being motivated, not for a commercial purpose or for making a name for themselves, but they're just sort of fascinated, super curious and, uh, and they're learning now, particularly in my book, I focus on pioneers, pioneering creators who are creating of a very long period of time.

Speaker 1:          09:20          And actually in quite risky and uncertain conditions. And I focus on the emotive and cognitive dimensions that lead to not only successful pioneering, creating, but also a deep pleasure. And to give you just a little insight, one of the creators who I spent time with, David [inaudible], who's one of the great marine photographers of our time and invented the split screen or the split Lens for photographing above and below water. And I was talking to David about the quality's important in a buddy, uh, in, in diving deep into the ocean. And just to point out, as I'll mention more here in the last part of my talk, uh, when we pioneer, uh, we tend to pioneer best not alone. Uh, and now we're not clearly not in a village, but we tend to have a team of buddy and, uh, who's thinking of our interest and we are thinking of her interest in that tends to maximize or optimize our survival.

Speaker 1:          10:27          And it's obviously true in diving in the ocean. I asked Dave, but what are the qualities that matter most to you? And he said, well, the second most important probably, which was interesting, uh, that he started with that was that they'd be kind, and it's kind of nothing worse than diving with somebody and kind of risking your life with somebody who is just fundamentally not kind. And, uh, so I said, well, what's the first most important, uh, quality? And he said, well, they need to be passionately curious. And so obviously at a frontier, if you're not a waking up and motivated to, uh, explore that, nobody will be right. So this passionate curiosity, empathy, these are the kinds of emotive and cognitive interventions that I focus on in the book. And I look at creators like Ferran Adria, the chef of El Bulli, uh, which closed down in 2011, arguably the greatest chef living today.

Speaker 1:          11:13          And I look at their creative process from great scientist, uh, living today to great inventors, uh, to artists. And I show that all of them follow a very similar, uh, process. Uh, they may, uh, all do really well economically. They made create a amazingly successful companies, or it amazingly successful a music theater. Uh, and yet, uh, what's driving them is something else actually, and it's related to the reward, uh, system, uh, of our brains. And you are all probably aware of, but just to remind you, there are three fundamental processes, um, uh, motivate us through the reward system. One is a wanting process. Um, one is a reinforcement learning process and one is a liking process. And an illustration of this very simply would be Anna Karenina. Let's say I'm a told to for my class or for some other reason want to read a Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina.

Speaker 1:          12:15          There's some, uh, pleasure actually and wanting, uh, anything and particularly wanting to read Anna Karenina. I read it. So there's this reinforcement learning. I began to like, uh, Anna Karenina and finally having finished the book, I really like it so much that I talk to my wife about Anna Karenina and we exchange ideas. And when I go to read my next book of Leo Tolstoy War and peace, uh, I have been informed through that conversation with my wife. And that kind of cycle of how we learn is really the cycle of how we create. And so in Ferran Adria as case from the ideating to the experimenting to the serving of a, an amazing dish, this cycle, um, in all of the creator lives that I describe a is fundamental, not only to learning the kinds of dimensions that I mentioned, the empathy, the passion and others that I'll mention in just a minute, but also creating value that they bring to the public.

Speaker 1:          13:10          There's a conversation much like what happens with the Internet and, uh, and everyone learns and then they go back. And not only is that a formative for the creative thing, this new thing that the world has never seen before, which goes through this cycle of communication with the public, but it's actually deeply pleasurable. So in my book, I highlight these emotive and cognitive dimensions, which are pretty contrasted to the emotive and cognitive dimensions that we tend to celebrate and culture and, and maybe, um, inculcate in our businesses and our business schools. And so it's clear that in, uh, the success of a Google or the success of a, even my book, uh, both sets of qualities are important. There are times where we're at battle. Uh, and there are times where we are discovering and the qualities that lead to the successful warrior are pretty defiantly not the qualities that lead to the successful pioneer.

Speaker 1:          14:16          And one of the challenges in writing a book or, um, uh, bringing great value to, uh, to the world in a company like Google is how do you balance these two? In my book, I am focusing mostly on this patch of blue and, and a and read, uh, and this, the, the cycle of creating that allows for these qualities to be learned and we learned and, and ultimately shared. Now, if I ask you, uh, what are the qualities and the neighbors you'd like to live with? I can imagine, which, I'm sorry. I hope I can imagine which a set of qualities they are. And one of the points in my book is while we are interested today, obviously in creating things that mattered to many over a very long period of time, this future that we're all looking for is really, uh, starts today, right?

Speaker 1:          15:06          And it's, and it's as much as it relates to this thing that you're mattering, it makes, it relates even more fundamentally to how you ate this thing, right? And so this a way of living, uh, uh, passionate curiosity, empathy and tuition in a sense of humility, all of which I described more fundamentally in the book is, is, uh, is critical, I believe, to introduce into our schools, into our companies and into interculture. And indeed in my book, uh, I talk about how that's happening. So the last part of my book, uh, emphasizes the grassroots Creator Movement, which I identify as beginning around the time of the first tweet, uh, the first maker Faire make magazine, uh, over the last 10, 15 years as you've thrived here at Google, uh, the world has radically changed, as we all know. But one of the things that's most striking to me is that over a short period of time, much of the planet has now placed itself in a position of creatively expressing itself in a way that never happened before.

Speaker 1:          16:13          And expressing itself in ways that endure. Much of this creation may be viewed by many as trivial or not interesting or even, um, profoundly irritating. Uh, but it is fundamentally and in many cases not to make money, not to make a name, although that happens, but to express oneself and express an experience that one has had, that aesthetic creation is I think fundamental to creating the world that we all wish to live in. And indeed, it's starting to re, uh, structure how we, uh, how we, how we run companies. Uh, the kinds of environments that companies are thriving in. And it's quite reflected by your own, uh, your own campus. And so I've been very involved. I've opened a restaurant in, in, in Cambridge and have my students making things. And so I'm really interested in this grassroots create a movement. And one of the things that fascinates me and I talk about in the book is that we're seeing this self association that creators, um, grassroots creators, um, make and uh, these happen online obviously, but they also happen in a, in physical environments.

Speaker 1:          17:25          And these could be habitat for humanity kinds of gatherings where they could be weekend food, making a gatherings. These could happen in classes, lots of maker activities. But these are often self associations of creators who want to create together, maybe write fiction together. And they come together really very frequently for the pleasure of creating together. And they learn as I write in the book these same qualities, uh, these aesthetic dimensions of creating that are, um, not only fundamental to creating a over a very long period of time but having fun and, and a personal self satisfaction. So I'm going to end really quickly here by talking about a, uh, to, uh, innovation, um, activities that I've been very engaged with over these 15 years as I've been learning myself and creating environments that foster this kind of learning. And, uh, one of these, um, relates to my work in Africa in the early two thousands.

Speaker 1:          18:33          I was one of the first grand challenge, um, gates grand challenge grantees and was focused on a inhaled vaccines and antibiotics for a tuberculosis set up, a not for profit and South African. I became struck by the middle two thousands. There was relative affluence coming to Africa by these mounds of trash that we're growing outside of the cities and this sort of importation of diseases that we thought. Until then, we're fundamentally developed world diseases like cardiac and depression and other kinds of illnesses. And shifted my work for many other reasons, to food and to, uh, to, uh, ultimately, uh, for a significant amount of my creative time to food packaging. And I came up with this idea that well, we really should make a packaging like nature makes packaging and the ultimate water bottle is the coconut and a, and so I began to reflect on how that would be done.

Speaker 1:          19:24          Now this was for many years a curated in a cultural context where we did an exhibition in Paris at the level of 12, this cultural center that I opened in 2007. And a invited the public to, uh, eat water bottles. And, uh, for, uh, two or three years. This, uh, kind of Wiki food, uh, was a cultural experiment and we set up an underground restaurant in, in Paris and a, this led to accompany a eventually and to products, um, uh, that, uh, sell particular on the east coast and ultimately to this product of which I have some here, which you can now make any fruit in the form, uh, or any food really in the form of grapes, uh, and a and the product that is now launched and that you can taste or a fruit, kids are not eating fruit anymore because the trend is going down because fruit, um, you sort of complicated to, uh, eat and parents are concerned about skins, but you can remake fruit, uh, with these edible, um, packages if you will, or skins.

Speaker 1:          20:26          Uh, and this work now through, um, uh, a number of collaborators is, is moving to, uh, a, uh, an effort in Africa, particularly in Sierra Leone, uh, to develop a local food forums, uh, that are environmentally sustainable and that are highly, uh, in fact, derived by, by micro nutrients. So what began as an idea in Africa moved through a cultural environment for a time that might've been an in determinant, certainly was, uh, in the process, became a company, a venture backed company, and is now coming back to Africa all through a process that kind of needed to have this open ended, uh, and um, uh, driving force that was other than pure commercial interests. Now just finish by saying that I've also been interested in since my first company, uh, related to inhaled insulin and, uh, delivering health and wellness to the air and have become fascinated since the Nobel prize in 2004 with the revolution happening in, uh, in, in mill factory biology.

Speaker 1:          21:35          Uh, the largest sub class of the human genome is the olfactory receptor subclass olfactory receptors and not just in your nose there throughout your body. And so this is amazing conversation that's going on since soreally inside of you that we understand now is fundamentally related to olfaction and clearly, uh, plays a major role in metabolic health and neurologic health and getting that right. Um, uh, we believe is partly related to, um, uh, writing. Some of the metabolic and neurologic dysfunction that's happened here over the last 30 or 40 years. And so we've developed a platform for digitizing scent and began to work and collaborate with Questlove and thinking about synesthesia and, and, uh, how these kinds of, um, experiences can, uh, improve, uh, wellbeing and, and, uh, experience with, um, even of, uh, music, uh, and ultimately come into work environments, looking how sensory design can improve the workspace.

Speaker 1:          22:35          And finally, um, we're coming out with our first real, um, uh, mass market product here this year, uh, which I can share with you, which is a way of, uh, creating flavor images, um, either autonomously or over any food you can kind of color any food with a flavor of chocolate or popcorn or a or rum. And, uh, and then in consuming that food, your brain tells you that. That's just what I've had. And so it's a really interesting way to address some of the food addiction issues that we're dealing with today. So once again, this, uh, project began it blue sky actually with some of my students, uh, developed in a cultural environment for a long period of time and finally, uh, through commercial forces is moving into the marketplace. So I'd like to just end by saying that these sorts of culture lab environments that began to show up in Europe and the middle two thousands are now increasingly I'm showing up in companies like yours. I view what I know of Google and uh, in part does a culture lab. Uh, we moved the level of cultural lab to Cambridge in 2014

Speaker 2:          23:46          and began the world frontiers forum and the World Frontiers Forum as a gathering of leaders from around the world. We bring them to experience 15 frontiers of tomorrow from contemporary art to biology, significant collaboration with the United Nations. And we try to hatch every year a project that can scale rapidly and the developing world and address one or more of the sustainable development challenges. And so this gets back to this notion of how do you capture the energy of the grassroots creative movement and, and help guide it towards sustainability of the human condition in the long time. That has always been our biological self interest. Thank you very much.

Speaker 3:          24:29          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          24:35          and not sure how we do questions and answers, but I'd really love to talk with you.

Speaker 4:          24:40          I'm curious what your thoughts are. If you've looked at this difference in the creative space between people who are kind of like the visionaries and how this idea like, oh, this product would be really cool. And then they assemble a team of people to get that done versus the creatives who are more on the side of like the actual people who are building the products and creating the technologies and kind of like what the different qualities of people on those different sides of the equation.

Speaker 2:          25:06          Yeah, absolutely. And you know, if you, I find always helpful too. So the question for those of you who didn't hear that clearly is how do you combine the visionary with the, the creatives who are bringing vision to, um, to practice. And a, I think implicitly you're suggesting that as I kind of did that they're really different qualities that lead to success here in sexist here. And often those cultures don't really mix very well. And of course this has been true throughout history and um, and uh, um, I think today in the highly specialized world that we live in, uh, and the way we educate, um, and organize ourselves, the barriers between those two, um, sort of cultures are greater. Um, I think that very successful, uh, cultural innovation environments and I view Silicon Valley would be an example of such an environment. Boston maybe for biotech, New York, maybe for Broadway theater, the tend to create sub cultures.

Speaker 2:          26:23          And I think that generally you have a learning culture. We're visionaries often sort of thrive. You have an experimental culture where people can fail and get paid for it actually. And you have a environment where people produce and that any of those are sort of relatively easy and you find them in many, many places. It's very hard. How hard would it create a culture where ideas and people move between them and where there's a trust that allows that to happen. And that is the sort of Pixie dust of, um, creating tomorrow. And again, it's something that I talk more about in the book. I think that to be a little bit more concrete, uh, partly because of the nature of the world that we are living in today. Um, and, and, and, and, and, and frankly, uh, the risky nature of the world we're living in today probably has a lot more to do with our evolutionary conditions. Then the world of big offices and kind of shore paychecks. Um, we can sort of, uh,

Speaker 3:          27:31          okay,

Speaker 2:          27:34          thrive less well with the luxury of considering myself a pure visionary or considering myself a pure, yeah. Applied kind of, um, uh, a creator and we're needing, um, all of us to, uh, tolerate and thrive in the conditions of pioneering, um, uh, vision, uh, as well as, uh, being engaged in the complexity of sharing that vision with others and learning from others.

Speaker 2:          28:10          So the ivory tower is, is under, um, I don't know if it ever really existed, but it's very hard to rationalize today and, uh, and, and I think honestly it's very hard to be a visionary and not be, um, engaged in what you're describing as that creative sort of exchange with the public. It used to be, we understood better what people needed and I think increasingly we need everyone to show, to tell us that. So I'm hopeful that those two cultures are coming together and a, and in any case, I think environments need to do a lot to just help, uh, both sides. Um, communicate. Hi. Um, so I agree with you there. There's a lot of exciting empowerment and personal creativity, but at the same time I see increasing trends toward, um, short term rewarding short term gains, um, shorter and shorter products like product life cycles, which is where we get these piles of trash and, and so, and so how does, how do we start to shift? Yup.

Speaker 3:          29:14          Okay.

Speaker 2:          29:14          Towards our culture valuing longer term contributions. Yeah. That seems like a real challenge to this. Yeah, no, absolutely. And as was true in the Italian renaissance, any sort of renaissance period, um, on the one hand we like to talk about, um, the heroes of the renaissance. But it was a very tough time to be living things. Everything was got to, gave vague and all of the institutions were pointing us in the wrong direction. And that's even more profoundly true today. And so it's hard to look at, um, anything almost in the media, uh, and uh, uh, if, if nowhere else, and not realize that, uh, the, the qualities that I'm highlighting, um, and that I believe are really critical to creating a world we all want to live in, are not, um, very frequently the qualities that are being propagated in our institutions. I think one of the things that I'm saying for sure is that those qualities of short termism are not sustainable. Right? And so I'm personally less interested in spending my energy and figuring out how do I kind of wake people up to, and just, there are a lot of people who are awakened and, and I think that in the spirit of the pioneer, um, I prefer to be with those pioneers making tomorrow. And just assuming that the, uh, those who, you know, the, the unsustainable activity here, we'll, we'll stop at some point.

Speaker 5:          30:39          I had a similar question to gold on, on his, about a short term thinking long term thinking. We have a lot of, uh, many institutions including the government in the u s ray, you elect officials every four years. Companies like Google, you have a annual quarterly performance reviews and things like that. You have to show some progress towards a goal. Uh, how do you bridge that gap between sort of needing to show some short term progress, short term goals in the long term kind of solving longterm problems? Like asteroids hitting hurts. Yeah, 20 years from now, 50 years.

Speaker 2:          31:16          So the great question, and I, um, as I also write about in the book, um, and maybe did not emphasize enough here, I am not, um, I don't believe personally that the value that a Harvard University brings to the world or a Google brings to the world, both institutions being under extreme pressure to deliver value today. Um, and, uh, this semester or this quarter, uh, and both, however, being highly invested in, um,

Speaker 6:          31:51          yeah,

Speaker 2:          31:51          the future of 30 years from now. Uh, so there's, uh, uh, the big question, which is what you've just asked, well, how do you balance the fact that we do have students showing up the semester? They really do need to take a class. And maybe it's true that we need to rethink education completely, but meanwhile, you've got students, you've got to teach today and you can't tell them what we're figure if you get out. Right. And so that's Kinda the issue. Um, so I think what defacto is happening, uh, and it explains my role at Harvard University. Um, and, and, uh, I think, um, from my understanding of Google and, and, and a lot of the, uh, sort of California tech, um, uh, technology scene,

Speaker 2:          32:36          sort of enlightened leadership that is giving space to whether it's giving all of you time to think out of the box or letting you, um, sort of create a company and move off campus and, and sort of creating these sort of experimental sandboxes where, uh, we can dream about the future. Um, and that itself is relatively simple. What's difficult actually is how to create that sandbox. We're not only do you go off and sort of think long term, but what you do matters to me back here. So that's the bigger issue is how do I stay in touch and not lose sight of you? Wow. How do I keep carrying? And that is really an enlightened leadership issue. And I, I think getting back to this point that I tried to make earlier, um, the good thing about where we're at right now is that it's so urgent that we pay attention to the longer term future that we kind of just can't afford to send you off to think about the future and then forget about you.

Speaker 2:          33:37          And so I think that there's clearly an awakening, a happening today that I am hopeful, um, will lead to more of that. But it is a complicated a balance, um, that I think all of us in a way strike in our lives. And if you think back childhood, I have kids now 15, 17 and 19 and there I've learned so much from them and I still do. Um, uh, but if you think back on the qualities that made you survive adolescence, um, where you needed at the same time to be profound, the moment at local and at the same time yet to think about, I'm going to call us and I got to go. And you had to kind to think, and you were in this sort of, that's, that's really what life is about. Right. And I think that there's been too much now for too long where we kind of assumed that we'll that ended and then you kind of, and then this w it's, it's, it's, we need to balance all those things. For sure.

Speaker 4:          34:34          I just want you to hear your thoughts on AI in creativity. I think with artificial intelligence today we tend to kind of see more and more of things that we are already thinking and people that other people were thinking. But how you go outside the box and how you see AI playing a role. Belinda? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          34:54          Well, again, the question of it, this is another big, big question. And, and uh, I think my innocence will help simplify the answer. Um, so let me just first say that one of the things I write about in the book and that I, I, I'm experienced every semester with my students is this first day where I'm, uh, you know, presenting the concept of the class. You've got to create something that matters. And, and, and I in one year, and I write about this in the book as student asks this question and this gets asked every year in one form or another, what if I don't have an idea? You know, and uh, that the compliment to that is the student who says d and then the next day, but I found it online. Everybody knows this is like out there already. And my point to both of those, uh, young people is, is the same that, um, if you were getting to artificial intelligence, I just want to finish this little thought that I think what makes you matter, uh, no more than me in a certain way, is that you own your experience and I don't.

Speaker 2:          36:05          And that experience tells you something about now, uh, and about the needs and opportunities now that only, you know, and if from that you observe, you're mindful enough to kind of just notice and you have an idea, I want that is coming from this intuition, a lot of observations that you could even articulate. And so, yeah, we all want to create a wheel. And then he said, well my God, people have created wheels for a long time. But I will say to you, but forget about what people are great and why the hell did you say wheel? What is that mean for you? And as you dig into it and you dig into that Big Bank of knowledge, which is intuition, uh, you will have created something unique. The a wheel. So I say all of that to say that I think two things about it, artificial intelligence from my really distant perspective, one, um, the obvious thing that really what's happening is the national and artificial s kind of merging and we're all, because it's kind of, we're going to be difficult to really separate between the two and already is right.

Speaker 2:          37:05          The whole notion of consciousness as being something that's biological, it's crazy. It's clearly distributed. And so clearly there's this merger going on. I'm not fairly, so a big issue in that is, is learning, learning to adapt to this drafted that we don't all learn. So that's a huge issue. Um, I think the second thing, and this gets to thriving and humanity and the long term, I think that my intuition is that what is happening here with the advance of artificial intelligence is what makes us human most human, which is not probably the calculus that I learned when we, well, when I was like 20 years of age. But it's actually that intuitive bank of knowledge of my moment, right? I own that. And I own that in a way that, um, no computer, however smart who wasn't there can now. Right. And so being able to mine that, uh, and you know, it's, as, you know, as we're advancing so rapidly towards the future of artificial intelligence and present, we're discovering that biology is like a black hole in terms of the complexity and, and a sophistication and a, you know, so I, my, my guess is that there will be a, a coexistence, uh, again, not without pain.

Speaker 2:          38:23          Uh, and, and I think there are a lot of issues, as I say, I'm related to equity and how we, how we manage this. Okay. I'm, I'm trying to really hard to resist the temptation to just Mander and ramble. Um,

Speaker 7:          38:36          I'm going to try to make this as short as I possibly can, but it sort of piggybacks off of Tom's comment, and I don't know your name, but the comment you had after, um, and something you said about, uh, the Italian renaissance. I recently read the, the new biography of Leonardo Da Vinci. And one of the things that struck me was, and this was according to the author, like how often that he had a patron who just gave him so much leeway and so much time, and then he spent the time just doing whatever he wanted or moving on and not procrastinating. And, um, you know, he, he left angry patron after angry patron. Um, but that freedom that he had to do whatever he want led to two or three amazing masterpieces and a lot of sort of half, you know, a lot of half finished stuff, a lot of, um, exploration and, uh, as, as, um, the other two commenters alluded to now. And as you said now, like we're so goal oriented and so quarterly goal, yearly goal focused that I know you said in response to both of those, the policy is not like, I guess the focus of what you're thinking on with this, but it does seem like a natural, like next step to, to seem like how can we unlock more potential from people? There are a lot of creative people. How do we unlock that?

Speaker 2:          40:04          I respond to that. Yes. Okay, cool. So that's it. Now, you know, I, I read that, in fact, I, I go more into this in the book. Uh, take Leonardo, um, as you say, the, the, the Patriot and what I call activator was, uh, played a big role. Patrons look different today. It's true. We have the Larry Pages and we have the bill gates. But the radical change in patronage, a few wells that's gone grassroots. And so those are kind of, but, but activators, um, are everywhere. But the activators matter. Um, and uh, the second thing is this, what I called culture lab in Florence. He was super lucky to have been born in Florence, but he was born in Florence, right? So there's all this stuff going on and experimentation was being invited and, and there was a culture that could look at the experiment of the Duomo and call it beautiful, right?

Speaker 2:          41:01          And so there was this ability to see the new, uh, as, as, as potentially being very beautiful. And so it invited. So there's a culture, uh, that mattered. And finally, Leonardo would be a real sort of model of the kind of dimensions that I'm, I'm sort of referring to. And so we do need this, um, environment that, uh, includes people willing to bet on you. Um, and, and to particularly bet on your ability to realize the dream that matters to more than you. Uh, we do need you to be surrounded by those who can appreciate it. Um, and, and, uh, and we, we, we, we do fundamentally need, um, you tried. So I think that while again, getting back to the earlier point, uh, we are in and you are here at Google and I am to the extent that I'm at Harvard in environments where you see a lot of the, uh, kind of the success of the last 20, 30 and maybe more years, kind of an an inertial wave that we're part of that may be a little bit overwhelming, particularly we try to move away from it sort of my role.

Speaker 2:          42:23          It just got to give good care of Gulag. But, um, that fortunately that is not the whole of human experience right now. And I think that all I can say, which is kind of how I manage my relationship with Harvard University for Super Delighted and lucky that Harvard is still, um, um, calls me one of their faculty members. Uh, but I spent a lot of time away and I spend a lot of time in my own space. And, uh, I think that, um, depending upon who you are and the kind of pioneering you want to do, uh, an enlightened, um, organization, I'm sure Google should give you that space. Now. It's just important to understand that Leonardo let a really risky life be any, he was gonna not happy a lot of the time. And he was kind of, I didn't feel he was getting credit. He had a lot of stuff. And so being out alone is, there's a lot of these had realized that, you know, hanging by your fingernails is it, it looks great when you then kind of got to the top of Mount Everest, but you're mostly hanging from his fingernails and, and you've got to me, I personally feel that that's, we need to, I'll do more of that. Um, uh, so, uh, that was a rambling response to your rambling question.

Speaker 7:          43:35          Well, I have a very directed short followup. Sorry. What are some of the interventions, I guess specifically you mentioned the foundation that went to Cambridge and then, you know, I know in your, I'm sure in your development of insulin that you had opportunities or things that unlocked that ability for you. Yup. Um, and so I was just wondering like, without getting too much into the weeds of policy, like what are specific things you've seen besides what you've already mentioned that, that have worked for, you know, people who maybe otherwise would not have had the opportunity?

Speaker 2:          44:04          Um, well, let me say that in, um, in, in, in my case, um, and I get, I write quite, you know, I write about it in the book. Can I also point this out and other creator lives? Um, I have found that in pursuing, um, my dreams to the extent that my dreams mattered more than just to me, uh, I have very frequently come to the edge where this could be the it and I always found, uh, someone, uh, who came and helped. And this notion of activator, which obviously in the Italian renaissance, there's some really famous ones, but they're everywhere right now. And one of the great joys of my own creative life is the discovery that I'm not alone, and that there's this kind of network. Uh, and, and so that's, and, and, and so in the inhaled insulin case, I was a theoretical guide, written a couple textbooks.

Speaker 2:          45:13          I had five people in the world had read and published this article. And I had a series of people, um, if venture capitalists I mentioned who was more than a venture capitalist who played a really big role in my life, but many, many, many, many people. So is there a recipe? Um, I don't know. I mean, I, I have lived for many years in Paris and have had lots of conversations with, um, the French government and academia in France. But how do we create like Harvard in, in, you know, pair? Is it an endowment? Is that what we need? You know? And so my big point, and maybe this is the most concrete thing I can say, there are, there's an amazing education in, in France and in many ways and, and, uh, really just such bright people and such a rich culture. But one thing that is, um, that's not thrive, uh, they're speaking really generally is as a student.

Speaker 2:          46:06          Uh, when I, uh, leave a university, there's, there's not a possibility to take a big risk. And, and, and, and, and, and, and do really, really well. I'm really quickly, I mean it's more of a, uh, a climb the ladder kind of phenomenon. And I think that the, um, the, the creating of opportunities, um, for the dreamers is, is the, the most important thing that we can possibly do. And I think it's, it is a challenge for a big successful organizations to create those because it's hard to measure the value of the little experiment in the context of the big, big mission. Uh, but, but that betting, and maybe I'll, I'll finish by just saying that in a, I was just, just in Atlanta speaking to some people and, and, and the question was, well, what can we most do to like do our kids, you know, and to, to help them create a world that they want to live in.

Speaker 2:          47:03          And I'm kind of create what matters in my point to them against the point I made in the book is that the best thing we can do, I think to our kids is, is help them see that they matter, right? And so I think that you can't create a, anything that matters if, if you don't feel you matter first. And so that, uh, mattering for me has generally been people from my dad to lots of people, my wife, lots of people who've kind of bet on me in a certain way. And so you matter. And so that's, that's the, uh, maybe the easy answer. What does it mean to matter? Uh, what does it mean to matter? Well, as I say a, it's a little bit, and I say more in the book, almost anything matters at some moment, right? Every drop matters at some moment, right?

Speaker 2:          47:47          And so that everything matters. So it's a provocation. But what it means in the title of my book, these are things that matter, not just to you, but to many and for a long period of time. And so a way to translate that a little bit before even that if you dig into, it's kind of, but they matter so much that people want them to endure, right? And so they will help them endure. It's like what you want of your kid when your kid leaves home, you want the kid to thrive, right? You want every, and that's not just your girl being, you know, really entrepreneurial, but people wanting her, you know, some people wanting her in the room, people. And so, uh, creating something that matters is creating something that's alive and that sort of has a right to live.
