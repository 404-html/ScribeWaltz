Speaker 1:          00:06          Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for being present. Happy Women's Day to all the ladies in the audience and it is a pleasure and an honor being here at Google. It was always on the 25th of December that my late father, Orlando used to recite the exact same story year in and year out to my elder brother, Giovanni and myself. It wasn't one of his own stories. It didn't stem from his own experiences, but it was a story that was relayed to him by a former mentor of his doctor Rossi. When my father used to work at the Cypress Embassy in London. The story was about a former under secretary of defense and that former under secretary of defense was invited for the second year running at the same conference as he took up the podium. He was holding a Styrofoam Cup with coffin in his hand and before he started speaking he went off script, took a sip, smiled, turned, looked at the audience and said, I want to talk to you about the Styrofoam Cup. Last year I was the undersecretary of defense. I flew here, business class, a limousine was waiting for me at the airport to drive me to my hotel. They already checked me in the next day there was another limousine waiting to bring me to this venue. They escorted me to the green room and the green room is the room where all speakers meet and prepare before they take the stage and when I asked for something to drink, they brought me coffee in a ceramic cup. This year I'm no longer the under secretary of defense.

Speaker 1:          02:04          I came, I flew economy class. I took a taxi from the airport all the way to my hotel. I checked myself in and it took 15 minutes. The next day I took another taxi to come to this venue and because I couldn't remember where the green room was, I asked them to escort me and they gave me or directions how to get there. Then I asked for something to drink and they showed me the vending machine and they said, take a surf on cup and serve yourself. Whatever you like. He turns, looks at the audience and says, we all deserve a Styrofoam Cup. The Ceramic Cup was never meant for us. It was meant for the position that I was holding at the time. So as you gained fame, as you gain fortunate positions or possessions, people will open up doors for you. They wouldn't refer to you as Sir and Madam.

Speaker 1:          03:14          They would bring gifts and when you ask for something to drink, they will bring your coffee or your tea in a ceramic cup. But because time doesn't stand still, we all deserve a Styrofoam Cup and I'm being former under secretary of defense found out the hard way we sh two should be alerted to the fact and to the possibility that we might not be our current position or our positions. Who we really are. As today's title suggests, which is finding your inner campus, is that internal camp has, when you strip away positions or positions that will guide you through challenging and difficult moments in business and in life.

Speaker 1:          04:13          Today, my dear friends, I will relay five personal stories and each story carries a valuable lesson. That's the lessons that power my internal campus and helped me navigate through the professional and the personal world. I hope, but by the end of the speech, the same stories and the underlying messages from these stories will help power your internal campus and help you navigate better in your life. So they make the road more smooth in order to reach for that elusive word, which is called success. Three disclaimers to make. Each and every lesson starts with a letter h as you will see from each story. Second disclaimer, there are no powerpoints. Unlike 95% of my keynote speaking, there are no powerpoints because I do not believe that there slide can depict interlock campuses and values as well as a vivid story which carries an underlying message. And disclaimer, number three,

Speaker 1:          05:32          the law. The third story, which happened 13 years ago in 2006 I've never ever before set this story in front of a professional audience. I only one message, I only once mentioned this story and that was on the 9th of October, 2018 as I was lecturing at University College London in front of 300 students. So let's begin and let me take you back to 1997 that was the year that I completed my studies in the United Kingdom. I've done my Ba and my master's degree and like any good Cypriot boy who has a flourishing business, I went back to the island, back to Cypress to work for the family business, all newcomers at our family business, which was called variety is still called variety. We deal with catering equipment and tabletop supplies for the Horeca industry. The Horeca industry is hotels, restaurants and catering. Institutions had to go through an induction course and that induction course started from my late father's office and I too had to go through the same procedure. That was what I called my phd degree only. It didn't last five years. It lasted five minutes. My father gave me two valuable pieces of advice for the first piece of advice. My father took a pencil and he took a sharpener and he said, Michael,

Speaker 2:          07:10          yeah,

Speaker 1:          07:12          I've sharpened your edge. I paid. You are lucky enough and I paid for your tuition, but if you leave a pencil standing on its own, it will fall. Go out their son and find the hunt that will keep you standing. The handed we'll keep you standing was an analogy for the mentors in my life, for the trusted advisors, the likes of your former colleague McCally Solo Montez who was escorting me here, all the mistakes that I've done in my life and all the failures that they've encountered. Because as the saying goes, when you lose, don't lose the lesson

Speaker 1:          08:00          and I owe a very big thank you to all the people who turned me down and all those who believed in me to hire me. And as I was making my way out of my father's office, he gave me the second piece of advice. He said, son, I see something in you. My feeling is you will do well in life 10 15 years down the road. And when you do well, when you gain positions and possessions, if for any reason you think that there is one person, then you don't need them because you either outgrown them or get in a better position. That's the day. And I as an experienced professional, young professional, I rush to fill in the sentence and I said, that's the day that I made it, that he said, no, that's the day that you lost it all sir. So the first stage in our first story, my dear friends is age for being humble. Understanding that as you rise up the hierarchy ladder as you taste success, always remain humble

Speaker 1:          09:15          because we are not our current successes. We are not our trophies, we are not our positions or our positions. Which leads me to the second story that happened in 1998 I was one year into the family business and Lo and behold, the company that my dad told me to take care of, which was Carlisle food service products. It's the tumblers where you have your juice here at Google of like food service products. We want the first European award. So the Americans taller to fly all the way to shallow together with my brother, all expenses paid to get an award. And we were lucky because there were seven days of celebrations and on the last day, Jeffrey Gitomer, one of the best sales consultants in the United States, came to speak to us for all those who know me. I cannot stand still for 10 minutes. I stayed live at that on my chair for six consecutive hours. As soon as Jeffrey Gitomer finished his talk, I ran up to him and I said, Mr Gitomer, congratulations. How can I become like user? And he turned, he looked at me and said, it's easy and it's difficult. And as I say, period, I said, what's easy is that study on your chosen topic, whichever topic of that is

Speaker 1:          10:51          for two hours every day except weekends. In five years, you'll be recognized in your country in 10 years worldwide. I said, sir, I'll start today. I bought his books. At the time he had only two books. The Sales Bible and customer satisfaction is worthless. Customer loyalty is priceless. I even bought his cassettes, not DVDs, not cds, not USBS, but cassettes. And I was listening to Jeffrey Gitomer's cassettes in my car, which was sales messages coming out, driving from one town of Cyprus to the next, promoting Caroline food service products and all the other products that we had that variety, and I was weeping in my car, listening to the messages, and I have a feeling that people looking from the outside thought that I was going to a funeral. I still remember my favorite tape, my favorite cassette. It was one or 1.5 rules for success. Let me tell you my favorite rule for success. It was the one oh 1.5 you're given a bucket of water in a bucket of cement. You can either build a stepping stone towards success or a stumbling block. The choice is yours,

Speaker 1:          12:20          and he was right. Even the great author, Malcolm Gladwell in his book outliers, he said the exact same thing. He popularized the notion that wasn't his, but it was the 10,000 hours. Malcolm Gladwell said that if you want to achieve something, you need to put those 10,000 hours in. Even the Beatles were known for seven consecutive years as they played music in what was eastern Germany at the time and it was after they hit that mark, the 10,000 hour mark that people started to recognize them. Even great criminals, as it says in the book, need 10,000 hours to perfect their craft. So my dear friends, the second age is age for hard work. I know you work at a technology company and I know that intelligent work is also important, but hard work takes precedence over intelligence work. I guess what I'm saying to you is sacrificed something today so you can gain something better tomorrow,

Speaker 1:          13:37          which leads us to the third story, which I've never before said in front of a professional audience so you can cut the camera now. I'm joking. 2006 as a good Cypriot boy who was working at the family business getting a bit older. By the way, I am 46 even though I look 45 just for your information, it was time to get married. 700,000 inhabitants on the island of Cyprus. We invited 4,000 to the wedding. That was almost 1% and the night before the wedding I found out that my wife was cheating on me. Yes, I know you say such a good looking guy and she's cheating on him. Can you believe that? I had the same feeling.

Speaker 1:          14:33          So what did I do? I had to think for a while and then I called everything off. My mother was crying. My late grandmother was hysterical. What will happen to their family name? What will happen to our image? What will happen to your image? What would happen my life? I told them the only person who hasn't spoken like always and waited and waited was my dad. So he comes up to me, he says, Michael, let's go to the front veranda. The Front Veranda in my parents' home was where the bad news were delivered. The back veranda was where the good news were delivered. So I go to the front veranda. He puts his hand on my shoulders and he says, son, you have guts. Actually the word he was wasn't guts, but for this speech at Google, it's guts. When I die, he continued on. I'm very happy and I will die peacefully knowing that I can leave the company to your brother, Giovanni, who has the wisdom and the patients and also to you son who has guts. So my dear friends, the third age is age for honesty and I'm not talking about honesty from the other person because you cannot control that. It's being honest with yourself to take the hard decisions. Even if he'd paints you at the time that you are taking those decisions

Speaker 1:          16:18          and we move on to the fourth story. One year after not proceeding with a wedding, 2007 now I had to find the guts to go tell my dad that I wanted to leave the company and pursue what you see me now doing, giving keynotes, training, development and consulting. I go up to my dad. I explained what I wanted to do. He says, son, let's go to the front veranda. We go to the front veranda. He said, Michael, you can go your way. I'm sure you will succeed, but if you leave the, they will close down. He bought himself 1,100 days. I stayed at the family business for another three years and when the time passed

Speaker 1:          17:09          I went back. My father was a true gentleman. He said, son, you will do very well, but I would like to give you some advice, go your own way, but I would like to give you some advice. This is where the fourth age comes in. Always be helpful, deliver value first or deliver value without expecting anything in return. And he gave me two pieces of advice that I will never forget. The first piece of advice was that when you meet prospects and they ask you to give quotations, never merely right accommodation, right self help book, give them so much value that they can see their vision, give them so much material and value so they can bring it to life. If they decide to come with you, your price will see minute. If they opt to go with your competitors, at least you have built a stepping stone towards their success.

Speaker 1:          18:16          And my father was right and I still do it. Up until today. Even recently when a company from New York contacted me to do a cultural enhancement project, which involves strengthening the team and it had a 360 degree evaluation, which means that those managers were evaluated by the top management, by their peers, by their subordinates, and by customers. I didn't just write a quotation, I even sent a five page pdf with all the questions, everything that I was intending to ask. And if I don't get the job, I still know that I added value to that company. And if I do get the job, they can come back and alter some questions, change some. And even giving me some feedback. What my father was telling me is be a trusted advisor, not a salesperson.

Speaker 2:          19:13          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          19:14          And I guess what I'm telling you is transform your thinking from what can I get from you too. How can I serve you? And the second piece of advice he gave me that day was that Michael, you will never be the smartest person in the room. And he and my dad had foresight. Even though he died in 19 months ago, he never knew I was coming to Google. So this guy had foresight and it's true, my dear friends, even if you are wanting a million in a 7 billion population, there are another 7,000 people exactly like you. Why should they hire you? Recently I was at singularity university. I took a course there and they have the same philosophy. They were telling us that engineers, the brightest minds, scientists, we're trying to fault protein three dimensionally and they were trying for 15 years nonstop and they never managed it. They all pent up, they open sourced it and in 10 days only a wife from the Midwest folded protein. So the experts are the known experts, the experts sometimes or outside your organization. And it is not a coincidence that in the book of how Google Works, it says on page 175 default to open.

Speaker 1:          20:49          So have you kind of not be the smartest person in the room. You can be something else. In my case, I opted to be the prom test and I have a rule. If you go onto my website, you will see that I reply back to my messages with the rule seven seven seven I reply back in seven seconds. If I'm not doing anything, I reply immediately in seven minutes. If I'm doing something, I want to finish it and then reply or in seven hours, which is the duration of a workshop, I finished the workshop and then I reply back. I'm not telling you to do that within this framework, but expanded if you like to 14 1414 or 21 seconds, 21 minutes or 10 to one hours, but refrain from staying at the 24 hour rule, which was invented when there were telephones, plaque on the wall and not smart devices.

Speaker 1:          21:45          And when they were at that time, people were more backward. So my dear friends, the fourth age is to be helpful, which leads us to the fifth and final age. And for this story, I need to take you to nine 11 2011 that was the day that I married the woman. Of My dreams. The lady that puts a smile on a daily face on a daily per day on my parallel in my face. And that's Christine. And on the 28th of January, 2013 she delivered the greatest present in our lives and that's our six year old Rolando who wanted to accompany me on this trip to meet the people behind his favorite platform. And that is youtube because thanks to you, he observes, he meticulously observes Christiana, Ronaldo, soccer Mousse on a daily, sorry, hourly basis.

Speaker 1:          22:48          So when we're going to get married with Christine, Christine went to your grandfather who passed away recently, who was married to his childhood sweetheart for 68 years. And she asked for advice for a happy marriage and her grandfather was very happy to give that advice. I don't know, maybe he was worried that I would walk away from this wedding as well. And he said to her, Christine, do you know what's the secret to a happy and a longterm wedding? And Christine said, what's the secret grandfather? He said, give 100% to your spouse and expect zero in return. If your husband to be gives 100% and expect zero in return, then you increase your chances of having a happy wedding. Think about it, my friends. It also applies to all the other agents. Give 100% of your marriage or to your relationships and expect zero in return.

Speaker 1:          23:50          Give 100% to hard work and intelligence work. Be 100% honest first and foremost with yourselves. Even if he'd paints you at the time you take the decision, take it if you are wrong at the immediate and apologize, be 100% helpful by offering value to others first and be 100% humble. Not because you will need someone further down the line in your career, but because it is the right thing to do. So if you're wondering by now, what's the fifth h, the fifth h is h for heart. Opening your heart and pour your heart in everything and anything that you do because it's only in this way that you can move away from positions and possessions and you move closer to your true north. And by true north, I mean that internal compass that is helping you to navigate through life after all my dear friends. It is that campus that represents who you are as human beings at your deepest level. Thank you very much.

Speaker 2:          25:07          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          25:19          thank you very much for being here today with us. Punish and I live at Toka doctors my heart and I think you represented few of the values we have in the company. Like put the user first, be Humvee, take risks. So, um, it's nice remembering again and again. I have few questions, uh, one then my first question is about mentors. Do you want to tell us who were your few of your mentors along the way? And My, my question is how do you find the minders? Is it something that comes into your life or you seek for them?

Speaker 1:          25:57          Okay, excellent question. Uh, how many mentors and mentors do not have age? If I'm going to be giving a speech on technology, uh, I rush to find younger people, older people. It depends. The people who are well versed. My father was my first ever mentor. I had mentors from my university days, my college professors. I even meet people on the road, which I keep in touch always. But you cannot find a mentor if you're not ready to receive a mentor in your life and to receive advice. And uh, I hope I have answered your question this way.

Speaker 3:          26:34          Definitely. And can I ask, it seems like the father, the model in your life I eat really played important role in Eh, have you kept, I don't know, he's wisdom in one sentence maybe or you know, something you want to share with us about this? It seems like a very pretty sure relationship.

Speaker 1:          26:54          It was a very precious relationship. My father died on the 22nd of August, 2017 and the time at that, the time that he died, he was wearing kiss variety tee shirt, which said customer service first. So my father always believed that you should serve your customer and that customer is also the internal customer and the way you treat your internal customers is the way that your internal customers will serve your external customers. So at the end of the day, my father wasn't focused on the price of the products. He wasn't focused so much on the quality, even though he believed in quality. That's why we imported a lot of German things, but he believed in people and he believed in helping people give first and then you will receive.

Speaker 4:          27:43          So awesome for my side. Thank you very much for this inspiring speech. Um, in your second story, you were talking about the advice you got to follow to practice two hours of a certain topic to become very good at it. And you immediately said, okay, I want to, I'm going to start today. I know exactly what this topic is now in my situation. I'm 30 years old now, 29 actually like me, 46 45 exactly. Um, I don't know yet, which is the precise topic that I want to focus on. That drives me for the next 15 years. And I also believe that this is kind of an generational thing. So what advice would you give to us to find this topic where you have your passion and the topic that that follows you and the drives that basically drives to the next 10 to 15 years?

Speaker 1:          28:43          I was 20 and that's a great question. By the way, I was 29 years old when I found my passion. When I saw Jeffrey Gitomer on stage, I was mesmerized. I went up to him and I asked him before that I was working for the family business and even though I was enjoying it very much, I felt it like you're filling it now. I might be this or something else. What I will say to you is whatever you're doing now, give it your best. As Muhammad Ali once said, if you're shipping, if you're sweeping the floors, sweep it to the best of your abilities. Give it your best because somebody is watching. My late father always told me to keep a note for everyone I meet. What did I like? What I didn't like, because even I'm not saying about your manager, but even if your manager doesn't appreciate what you do, which is not the case, but I'm just saying it. So why are you laughing guys? Somebody else is watching and whilst you're doing what you're doing to the best of your abilities, an opportunity, we'll knock the door. So be concerned. Shoes, do what you do. Continue being knowledgeable, put in those hours in what you're doing now. But you have to be honest with yourself. If this doesn't inspire you, you need to take the painful decision and do something else. And I'm not only talking about relationships,

Speaker 3:          30:03          I wanted to ask, you mentioned that you had kind of understood three years before you left the company, that you wanted to change career paths. So how did you find the courage to actually leave after three years and just, um, go off and do your own thing?

Speaker 1:          30:21          If, if that's scared, it means that I had the courage. Yes. Then I believed I was preparing myself for 10 years to find the courage to go and do what I'm doing. And from the day that I decided to go on my own, I had to believe in myself. First and foremost. I took my, uh, my father's advice on board and I was adamant, even though, and I will tell you when I went for my first Gig and they asked me, Michael, how much do you charge for a speech at that time? At that time it was 1,500 Cypress pounds. And the guy said, excuse me, 1,500 pounds for a one hour speech. Do you know how much your competitors are charging? And he told me two names, which had 30 years of experience and they were charging 500 lbs. Why should I pay you 1,500 pounds and you don't even have experience?

Speaker 1:          31:20          And I said, sir, I was preparing for 10 years and if you don't like it, I will give you your money back. And he threw me out of the office, but the next year somebody else believed in me. I kept the 1,500 ceiling and they gave me a chance. It went on to youtube. We just don't think you know which company by Google and thanks to Google, I commanded my pricing and thanks to their performance on stage because my father told me, if you're going on your own son, don't put your prices low. Because if you are very good at what you do, it will never go up high. It all, it will take 10 years to go up here. Put your prices high, deliver more value than expected. You'll get a lot of rejections, but you'll get a chance eventually. Any of you are wondering where will you find the money? You can do two jobs until you find the money to go for your dream.

Speaker 3:          32:21          So you're talking about really believing in yourself and continuing on as well. Training yourself and learning and educating yourself and then going for it.

Speaker 1:          32:31          Yes, but I'm a be a little bit against, uh, the secret and it's philosophy that think about it, it will come. Think about no working can, it will come put on, put in those hours and it will come and always keep your breach assault pen. My late father used to tell me, oh, we send a Christmas card. At that time they were sending Christmas cards, but always send a Christmas card. Always connect with the people that you meet on the road because your network will determine your net worth at the end of the day, not only your abilities.

Speaker 3:          33:06          And I have one more question if that's okay. He spoke about the turn ours off yourself. So if you do not mind speaking to us about that a bit more,

Speaker 1:          33:16          I will speak about my true north beyond possessions, beyond positions. I agree with my father that you need to be humble because what else is there to be and uh, I find my true north when I hugged my son or when I'm over with my wife and I think what, what powers everything is the word trust. If you trust people who are in your life, you have less tension and more trust to go forward and do what you need to do. You even have allies within your company, within your relationship, inside your flood or inside your house. You need allies because no man or woman is an island. You cannot do it alone.

Speaker 3:          34:02          So I have one more question. How do we learn and navigate around failures?

Speaker 1:          34:10          I also said before that when you lose, don't lose the lesson. If failure is a chance to understand. For me, when I used to work at the variety of family business, I always asked, where did you find us? For you guys? You know, where did they find you? It's called Google ad words and the rest. But I w I used to ask and when I fail at some people, which, what is failure? If you stand up, you're still standing. Uh, you need to ask what went wrong. Contemplate, think, look at your offer again. Uh, talk to people, even to the people who consider you in inverted commas, failure. So the best way is asking like you, like the Greek contingency is placing the questions. More questions. Questions are very important. You judge a man or a woman or a person by the quality of their questions, not by the quality of their answers. That's how you deal with failure with lots of questions.

Speaker 4:          35:07          Um, thank you very much for the speech. I was focusing on the um, the part, your rule of the seven, seven, seven and also the, the 10,000 hours that you put in. Um, I mean you were working full time for the family business. On top of that you put in 10,000 hours and now you traveling around the world giving speeches and you still reply by like seven, seven, seven. Um, w how would he do that?

Speaker 1:          35:31          You're contested tonight if you like. Yes, I fly Emirates. That is wifi connection. If I'm going transatlantic, yes I do it because if you're a prompt, people attributed more things to you that you are reliable, that you are dependable, that you are the one they should work with. And it's also a differentiator. It's zone. Uh, Marilyn asked me how do you deal with failures? I also should turn the question on its head. How do you deal with success? I ask why beat the American Pni why did Microsoft hire me? I asked them and you know, what's the answer I get? Most of the Times it's not because you are the best. Because I said earlier, if you're one in a million in a 7 billion population, then another 7,000 people like you, which they're very good in, it might have a lower price. 90% told me because your prompt Michael, because you are the liable because we were in a hurry to set it up and I knew I could count on you. There are other things, of course you shouldn't stand up here and talk about fear is that you don't believe in, you shouldn't talk about others people's stories except if that's an example that you want twain for to be truthful and the rest. So I do it because it's also in my favor because most people won't do it. Imagine if somebody walks into your house and you don't greet them because you're busy. It's impolite. Somebody is walking into your electronic house and they're knocking the door.

Speaker 1:          37:07          Thank you very much for the speech. Mr [inaudible]. Um, how would you define success? Excellent question. That's why I used the word elusive for success. It cannot be defined and it cannot be so broad to include all of us. Success is a different thing for every different person. If you ask me what success success is, Christine and Rolando, success for me is to live by the values that my father instilled in me and my mother. Of course, success is to wake up in the morning and be happy doing what you're doing, love what you're doing and if you're not happy with it, I'm not saying quit, but find a way to be happy doing it and be honest enough if you are not, if it's after six years, it really pains. You find the strength to move on that success because some people tell me, my colleague, you are a freelancer, sometimes you might not work as hard. No, I work hard to see a vision and to go after that vision with no guarantees. So for me that was success. For you, it might be something else, but it's elusive as they say. In theater

Speaker 1:          38:26          you got as good as your last performance and in my job you are as good as your last speech or training session. I want to talk a little bit

Speaker 3:          38:36          about your public speaking career and acknowledge that about half the people in the Google double office, um, don't have English as their first language. So it's a challenge to speak, but even more so when English is not your first language. So can you tell us a little bit about how you ramped up your communication skills? How do you practice? What are your tips?

Speaker 1:          38:52          Excellent. Very good. Because we are also addressing this one, the online program that is coming out

Speaker 1:          38:59          there was once a great football player by the name of Malenka spoiler. It's used to play for my team in Cyprus or Poland. Malenka was a very talented player, extremely talented. He never played in Europe. He never played in the big league because he was very slow. And he gave me a piece of advice. If you're a slow player, passes the ball faster, the ball travels much faster. And if you dribble, so if you, if you, if you are not a native speaker, it's not the fancy words. Keep it short, keep it simple. And practice, practice, practice, practice.

Speaker 2:          39:39          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          39:40          perfect. Practice makes perfect. So try it again and keep it simple. Even with my mentees, when they come for coaching sessions one on one, you, even if that is even if their, if their native language is English, I always tell them, keep it short. Keep it simple. They gave me 45 minutes, one hour to speak. I spoke 30 minutes. You shouldn't be keeping you too long if the people get the juice of what you want to say, it's not the fancy words and think about it, which is your favorite politician. My feeling is, is not someone who uses language that you can not resonate with, all understand, but it's someone who speaks to your heart. Keep it short. Keep it simple and practice.

Speaker 2:          40:24          Okay.

Speaker 1:          40:25          Thank you very much. It was a pleasure.

Speaker 2:          40:27          [inaudible].
