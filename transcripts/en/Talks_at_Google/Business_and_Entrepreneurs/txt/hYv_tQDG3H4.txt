Speaker 1:          00:06          Hi everybody. Welcome to Google talks. Today's a very special day. I want to introduce a great friend of mine and somebody that I really look up to in the tech space. His name is Ardell Millhouse. What makes him unique and very special is he has led many hackathons in Rhode Island, has been recognized by President Obama and Congress, men and women. Aside from that, the beautiful thing is that he's helped today lead many underprivileged and underserved markets for people that are interested in becoming engineers. Aside from that, he's constantly challenging the status quo and always making sure that many people are involved and challenged every day in a very technological, digital age. I'd love to welcome my dearest friend and a leader in Tech and a serial entrepreneur are not mail house course.

Speaker 2:          00:58          Thank you, Miranda. Thanks for having me. It's been great to be here. All right, so good enough to noon everyone again. My name is RNL Millhouse and it's an interesting story and an incident interesting journey that we're embarking upon and today we're going to be talking about rebooting emerging domestic markets. This concept was first spoken about about three or four decades ago by a Harvard University professor who talked about taking urban centers and the ticking the underserved workers in those communities, training them, give them the right technical skills or labor skills that they needed to integrate into society here in America wrote a really great book about it, but the concept never really took off and throughout my life as I grew up in the story that I'm about to share, I always thought about how can we really make this happen? How can we take it from the page in print or on the stage as they often say in Broadway, right from the page to the stage, and I'm even writing a book about it, rebooting emerging domestic markets, rearchitecting the middleclass innovation process in America, and I'm an entrepreneur, a software developer, but I really think of myself as a social change agent, someone who is trying to bring about change and impact.

Speaker 2:          02:27          Steve Jobs talked about of all the things that he wanted to do in his life, he simply wanted to make a dent in the universe. And it wasn't about the money, it wasn't about the creations or the accolades, it was about making a significant change. And so I created a company called Intercity geeks along with a couple of other gentlemen. I'll be introducing them by name and another organization called career devs interested in Geeks. Our goal is to simply fuel computer science education and to drive innovation driven entrepreneurship throughout American cities in both underserved and under skilled markets are our main goal is to impact 1 million plus people in our pipeline. The other is called career devs and career dabs. This launching rigorous computer science academies along with Innovation Driven Entrepreneurial incubators. So while interested, he geeks is the nonprofit arm career. DEB's is the for profit arm.

Speaker 2:          03:31          How all this stuff comes together. You really need to take a deep dive into my story and it's a really interesting story. I believe it starts off back in Boston, Massachusetts, where I was born. I was born to a single mother, Dorothy Lee Millhouse and single mom, which is really the prototypical urban story that you hear for people of Color. Right. And my mother had four children. Which one is me? Can you guys guess? That's me right there. Second oldest. And what was interesting in Boston that we went from a middle class neighborhood. My mother ended up getting sick. We moved from the middle class neighborhood to a lower income neighborhood APP. She, after she took ill and

Speaker 3:          04:21          yeah,

Speaker 2:          04:21          wild Roxbury, which was a neighbor that we moved to, was very, very tough. There was gunfire, drug needles. I've had guns held to my head coming from a school where people robbing me from money, I would get home. My mother was like, oh, how was your day, honey? Let me go. Was fine. So a couple of things were interesting. One, we didn't know that we were poor and we didn't know that. I didn't know that we should be unhappy. We were happy. We had a nice family. And, but one day my mother, when we were on welfare, food stamps, section eight housing, she took her housing certificate to the housing authorities and said she wanted to move and they were asking her, where do you want to move? And she mentioned that she wanted to move to Cape Cod. Right. And it wasn't until we actually moved to Cape Cod that I notice this, that the urban lifestyle formula, we had been living, that there was a vicious perpetuating cycle that repeats itself. So in eighth grade we packed up, we moved to Cape Cod, and it was, you know, people go, this is the place that people travel to for, for, for vacations, right? From all around the world. And I'm living there 365 days a year. But I noticed another cycle, a virtuous perpetuating cycle, which was the opposite of what was taking place in Boston. And for the first time in my life, something changed my worldview

Speaker 2:          05:59          because living in Boston and Cape Cod, the dichotomy was incredibly different. On the Cape, I was taking courses such as Latin or I learned one of my favorite jokes [inaudible] suburby where are your underwear? We even had our, you know, a wrap for Latin. Latin is a dead language. It's dead as it can be. First it killed the Romans and now it's killing me, right? But Magnar chrome, Cherry Tati Pula of vigor. [inaudible] and so I'm learning all these different things. And when we moved to the Cape,

Speaker 2:          06:37          we didn't live in tenement buildings that you found in the city. We live right up the seventh hole or the dentist pines golf course. And I remember waking up one morning, I saw these little white balls in my yard and I said, mom, why are these balls keep coming into our yard? And what are those people out there doing? What are they, why do they, are they farming? It looks like they're trying to farm. What do they, what are they planting? I couldn't understand this. He says, no, honey, they're playing golf. I said, wow, what does golf and I've learned about Camelot, the Kennedys, they live 10 minutes from me. The Kennedy compound, John F. Kennedy, his family, everyone all right there, their lineage. So I heard the stories. I was regaled with all of the tales of their fame and their wealth and it was just a different perspective of learning about a former president, but their family lives down the street.

Speaker 2:          07:36          This is the next stage was kind of interesting. My first job in high school took place at a place called Fred's Turkey house. Now this is really impactful because while I was, I started off as a dishwasher, then a prep cook, then a line cook, then a shelf, but at this restaurant, the person that owned his name was Fred Bloom, one of my greatest mentors and influencers in my life. He had about four or five restaurants on the Cape and there was a gentleman that went to Harvard University that graduated in computer science who worked for him running all of the communications. Jeff rule. He was talking about trying to learn me to the dark side, which is computer science because aren't alley cause you don't want to be a laborer sweating away in a kitchen all your life. He goes, listen, you know you love playing around with computers and making these video games in school. Stick with that. And so I said, oh no. But then Fred said, hey listen, go to Johnson Wales University. Come back here and manage my restaurants. So there was a light side and the dark side tempting me.

Speaker 2:          08:36          Then in high school I took my first computer program in class. Pascal fell in love myself and several of the students. We were always getting in trouble, doing things with code that you shouldn't be doing and then I got a job working for my high school making $12 an hour as a junior. I was hooked. I was making more than I was making in the restaurant business and it was just phenomenal. Something else interesting that that happened on the Cape was one of my teachers was asking where I lived in Boston. I said, oh I remember living. We once lived on mass ave Massachusetts avenue and she said, Oh, you were right down the street from MIT. I said, am I, what am I who? She goes, no, Mit Ivy League university. Never heard of it. She goes, it was less than a quarter mile from me and that really bothered me that MIT and Harvard were so close, but they might as well be. They might as well have been miles away, planets away, different universe really

Speaker 2:          09:40          going to school on the Cape. Students would pull up in the school and BMWs, Mercedes or just brand new cars, brand new Toyotas. When our car, even though we lived on the Cape, it was still a, uh, we were still poor. We were using a housing certificate to live on Cape Cod, so sometimes dropping us off to school. We had this station wagon that had Mitch match wheels smoke coming out of the back of it and so I would beg my mother like, mom, can you please just, can you drop me off down the street because honey, but it's still like a quarter mile walk. I was like, I was just embarrassed to pull up in the school in that car.

Speaker 4:          10:20          Okay.

Speaker 2:          10:21          What was happening was that I was experiencing culture shock. I was seriously undergoing a sense of disorientation in disbelief about what I was seeing. My middle school, the cafeteria was more reminiscent of what you have here in Boston. We didn't have the cafeteria. It was everything was make shift and the food wasn't that great. Periodically we would travel back and forth to Boston and I began to see this divergence between my cousins lives in my friends' lives, my friends and their parents on the Cape versus they're my friends and their parents in Boston. As I was in Boston, I would notice that the adults were talking about how hard things were, that there were no opportunities. They just lost a job. They couldn't get ahead. They, their electricity was being turned off. This week on the Cape, everything was happy and everyone was doing fine. And as we would go back and forth, it was lights on, lights off, lights on, life lights off. And it was disconcerting. And I didn't know, I said in Boston and Cape Cod, 60 miles apart. So it really, really, really troubling back and forth. Cape Cod, Boston, Cape Cod to Boston.

Speaker 2:          11:56          And I remember the exact moment that this thing happened. I woke up one morning and I realized that I had two worldviews because of my friends in Boston. They all, and myself included, when I moved, initially moved to Cape Cod, I wanted to be a rapper, basketball player or some type of athlete or entertainer where everyone in the Kate was talking about where we going to school, what we're going to do without careers. And so hearing two different worlds, two different worldviews. And I saw that one worldview was just crumbling and the other was thriving. So I left high school and I went to college at Johnson Wales University, computer science, my, like my buddy cliff and at Johnson Wales, things really took off. I was a computer lab assistant and that's what I've learned about. I learned about innovation. I started taking some of the processes that they had in place that took four or five days to change the computers over at the end of each semester and I brought it down to a three hour process and my bosses were freaking out.

Speaker 2:          13:00          They were like, oh my goodness, this is amazing. And there were a lot of other things that I did that really, really impacted the university. Something really, really bad happened though. My freshman year, my mother passed away all those years of being sick on housing. She passed away. My younger brother and younger sister, my older brother and myself, we had to try to figure out what are we going to do? My older brother said, you stay in school, work hard, send money home on the weekends. And I did that until my sophomore year. I became a senior lab assistant at Johnson Wales, which I receive free tuition, which really saved me because the school was sending me notices that you have no money, you can't, you can't stay in school. And I graduate Johnson Wells and something interesting happen. The second job that I had was in Boston and when I was on the Cape, my mother would tell me all the time, pay attention or know I brought you down here so that you could pay attention to find out how people are becoming successful and family after family.

Speaker 2:          14:06          What does your father do? Oh, he's in a technology again, there was Jeff at Fred's Turkey house are now come to the dark side, but every family seemed to have some connection to some type of technical organization working in Boston. So I said, I'm gonna apply to a job in Boston. I applied for this data, telecommunications company, walked into the company. Another shock. I walked in and I was the only person of color within the entire organization and I said, they're not going to hire him, there's no way. But I become really good at what I do with technology, computer science. So I got an offer letter in the mail and it was for $80,000 and it was a second time. I was a shock culture shock. The company, much like here at Google cafeteria food chefs coming in, massage therapist. I didn't know that it was leading up to this.

Speaker 3:          15:10          Okay.

Speaker 2:          15:11          $80,000 a year. $15,000 annual bonus. 15,000 shares of stock. What is stock stock? What's, what stock is that like Campbell's stock? I didn't know are they gonna send me 15,000 cans of Campbell's doc? I don't want that. But it was culture shock round to something else hit me. I was no longer poor and it was welcome to the middle class. But I think as hard as it was making it there, if I had known that it was going to be that difficult, I probably would have given up. But since I made it this far, I said, well why stop at the middle class? Why not keep on going? What's the next second exit having store? So something interesting started happening. My friends, family and neighbors started noticing, oh Arielle, it's a new clothes, new car, living in a nice house. So people were peaking and then people started knocking on my door. Especially my friends.

Speaker 2:          16:23          I have a friend that was in the marines and he came up to me, says, Arnelle listen, I just got an a marines cause all I need to do is shoot a gun. What do I do? I got them involved in technology, in and out to him. His name is Jason, he's African American and another friend of mine, Rick Jamaican background, Hov, Cambodian, Tim, Irish American, Dave English, Osi Latino, Tim, Kevin, Derrick, Sam, Charlie Lin, John, Mike will, Jeff, chuck, Devin, [inaudible], rob, Kurt, so many other people that he started coming to me and my friends to get involved in technology, people who were on welfare, unemployed or severely underemployed overall about 25 people who now have an aggregate annual income of over $2 million. And if you look at the majority of those people all got married, all own homes. And so that cycle that my mother was caught up in and that so many other people were caught in single mother, no father in the household was now being broken in so many people's lives. And so many children, including myself, my two amazing sons right here in my amazing wife who I would not, I would not be here without. And so I started thinking again, how do we solve the income inequality puzzle? And the solution is simple. We have to do it at scale. And that's where I really began thinking about the rebooting emerging domestic markets.

Speaker 2:          18:09          So I had my great moment of epiphany, seeing it, what all of my friends had attained. And then over the past few years, looking at all of the pain that this country has been going through with the battles between race and income and the haves and have nots. I said, what I've done for my friends, I simply need to do for the rest of the country. That's easy, right? No problem. So I started a company called Intercity Geeks. It's a nonprofit and something interesting happened. I put an ad up on Brown university's website and this double major at my econ brainiac named Rapides binkies applied. I sit down with them, blew me away with his intelligence. He worked with me getting the organization going. And then I met another gentleman and he's here today in the audience. His name is cliff.

Speaker 4:          19:08          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          19:08          brainiac. You've seen like the superman comics brainiac. That's cliff right there and we'll talk a little bit more about that, but interested he geeks. We started teaching at the middle school level in providence and it got picked up in the news like, wow, this is really cool. No one's done this before, or at least not at the scale that we were looking to to run our programs. We were in channel 10 we're taking students to hackathons at Brown university and they were growing. They were doing amazing things of themselves. In the red shirt here you can see my son Matthias, he actually teaches with me now. He's a lead instructor for elementary school students. He's 14 years old, eighth grader, actually not 14 yet. In a few weeks he's going to be, but he's doing amazing things and again that generational stronghold, that generational change effect. Having a father figure, a mother figure that's nurturing him to help him grow in Elias is coming up behind learning as well.

Speaker 2:          20:19          So we went from middle schools to high schools teaching, talking about how they can get jobs in technology. Seventy thousand seventy two thousand dollars is the average of the PA jobs paying and Rhode Island, the mayor of providence contacted us and said, hey, you're doing some great things. What can we do together? So we created a hackathon for the city of Providence and not just any hackathon, but we were also recognized by President Obama for our, it was on the White House website August 4th, 2015 the culture shock is continuing to happen. I'm seeing the vision fulfilled of what we're trying to do. And for one of the hackathons that we did, what we attempted to do, we built a satellite communications array to communicate with the astronauts and the International Space Station as it flew overhead over Providence, the astronauts with sleeping. But we did get a ping connection signal with our device and, but we've stressed to the students.

Speaker 2:          21:23          When we did this, we partnered with a group from Brown University, middle school students and high school students who assembled the communications array, designed it and got it working. This is the type of innovation that we want to let students know as possible and they're like, now they go out there and they have the apps on their phone. I've had, I get calls from students all the time, Hey, I'm looking at the international space station going overhead. I'm following them on Twitter. Right, and they're talking about engineering, they're talking about aeronautics. These are the types of impacts and changes that you want to be to make everyone can't move to Cape Cod. After that, the governor of Rhode Island got in contact, have contact with us through her innovation department and we created a hackathon for the state. I also taught a Harvard computer science class called CS 50 in Rhode Island.

Speaker 2:          22:11          Over 500 people applied. We enrolled 150 and cs 50 is rooted in the c programming language, data structures, algorithms, computational thinking, strong, strong rigor, and it was during that course and here's a snapshot of it. That's my head there. I'll give you that same view, but during that class I met one student that approached me halfway through. Everyone was two or three weeks behind in the, except for one student who comes up to me and says, I'm finished with the course. I said, you can't be. That was cliff. Toward the end of the class, Harvard had a global computer comp coding competition and cliff's team was only one of 13 that finished with a perfect score out of 630 something teams worldwide. Perfect score. I was impressed. We be in a hanging out a little bit and cliff became my third geek crush that I had in my life.

Speaker 2:          23:14          The first was Jeff rule from Fred's Turkey house. The second was rapid lists and then cliff. So from there we formed career Deb's in career. DEB's is the for profit arm. We're launching our computer science training academy this summer. Are we teaching people in Rhode Island and New York in Boston? Rigorous computer science. We were just in Brooklyn two weeks ago. We're coming back again in May and there are 36 schools in the five boroughs. Had an interested in having career debs do work there. Same in Boston, same in Rhode Island, so we're expanding rapidly. In addition in our, the way that we're going to do computer science is different than a boot camp, so we don't call it a computer science bootcamp because the students are really going to

Speaker 2:          24:05          two. Oftentimes when we see students graduating from boot camps, they can't do anything significant when they complete the course, so we want to make sure that there's a lot of testing in a lot of rigor in ideation at every stage. We want to make sure that this is a creation portion that they can reiterate and from recall, do examples that they create. S really, really important. Plus the focus on data structures and algorithms, which cliff is a Jedi knight over. That'd be a cit since we were in a dark side, probably see it. The other thing that's interesting is that I've had several entrepreneurial journeys over the years and a couple of years ago I created a organization called crowd signed and I applied to one of the big incubators and I thought, wow, they're going to love my idea, and they rejected me. I didn't have an understanding of metrics, total address, total adjustable market space.

Speaker 2:          25:04          I didn't. There were a lot, there were a lot of things that I didn't understand, so I had to hit the books. One of my friends said, oh, go up to MIT. They're having this course on entrepreneurship. So I went up there, registered, sat in on it, learned a ton. It's like, oh bill, all that. He has his great book. You should check it out. Disciplined entrepreneurship. So I internalize that and as I've done that, several of the people have come to me now saying they want some entrepreneurial help with their products the same way. In the same way that I helped my friends learning about computer science, I'm now helping people learn about entrepreneurship. So cliff and myself, we're going to be also teaching about entrepreneurship and as creatives launches, two of the companies that we're highlighting, one is called common connect.

Speaker 2:          26:00          It allows you to connect with people as you would with linkedin professionally, but socially based upon your location. How many times are you traveling? You're walking past someone on eighth or ninth or 16th that you could probably have a lot of synergy with, but you don't know that person. Now with common connecting your pocket when you're passing that person you'll know and since you're in the same vicinity you'll be able to connect. Another one is called cross sign informed analytics that helped drive the market for unsigned artists. So it's data driven, analytic driven, innovative IP behind both of these companies that we're launching and cliffs the lead developer on both of those. So what's our vision? It's the same thing that happened with my friends, but instead of people. Now we're also looking at corporations, companies difference being not just starting a business, but what's a scalable innovation driven I p portfolio driven incubator look like that's designed for the under skilled in underserved. Because I've been convinced by bill all let and people from Brown university like Dan Warsh, Shea, anyone can learn entrepreneurship in, anyone can learn computer science if they apply themselves long enough, if they hack at it long enough. And so our goal is to create this multiplier, this network multiplier that will really bring upon this error where we can reboot emerging domestic markets here in this country. And so over time stay tuned in. Thank you.

Speaker 3:          27:54          Thanks.

Speaker 2:          28:02          If you are interested in getting contact with us or following our story, you can follow along on city geeks.org Korea, devs.com and you can email cliff myself as noted. Thanks once again.

Speaker 3:          28:17          So

Speaker 2:          28:19          we're going to take a couple of questions. If anyone has any questions they can feel free to ask them in or if you're interested in working for us and leaving Google. Yes. And we have microphones over that. So we're going to have each person stand up at a microphone to ask their questions.

Speaker 1:          28:35          Throughout all of the struggles that you faced with to your friend, you know, cities moving back and forth, what kept you so motivated to continue to go from the lower class to middle class to now being obviously a very wealthy individual?

Speaker 2:          28:50          Oh, I don't know if I would say very wealthy individual, but, uh, um, I took an Uber here this morning, didn't have a chauffeur, but, um, my motivation was

Speaker 2:          29:06          interesting. So here's an interesting story that from Cape Cod, I remember once being out in the ocean with some of my friends and one of my friends said, hey, let's swim out to my father's boat. It was that type of situation. So we're swimming out to what we thought was his father's boat. Then he told us he was joking, he goes, this is my father's boat. It's that went out there as much further away. And so in that situation there you just keep swimming cause you have to swim. And as I made it one mile or pass one goal, I just kept going and I kept swimming and, and then once I, like I said, because when I made it to the middle class, that's okay, why did this now? And even though it's hard work, I'm going to keep going because I looked back at a lot of my friends and family that were in Boston.

Speaker 2:          29:59          Everyone's working hard, whether you're a lower class, middle class or upper class, everyone has a pretty hard life in terms of the hours that you have to put in and different things of that nature. So I'd rather work hard to bring about success and also try to bring people along with me. So it's just, you know, I've never really thought about why. So to answer your question, I don't know, but it's just something you don't give up, you just can't give up. And I know that I had my younger brother and sister and that was a great motivating factor for me as well. And then once they were set at friends and family that came along and you know, you always see needs and I guess you see needs and needs that need to be met and you go for it. Thank you. Any other questions?

Speaker 4:          30:48          Yes.

Speaker 5:          30:50          All right. Thanks for checking your story. I really appreciate it. Great. Thank you. Talk about how the goal in a inner city geeks is to help do help inner city youth make the jump to middleclass through technology jobs. Have you considered looking into other professions like law, medicine, finance, and other professions for people who may not find themselves very acute to technology?

Speaker 2:          31:11          Yes, and I believe that will be the goal. But like with most things, when you're starting something, you can only do one thing well, right? You can only do one thing. Well. And for instance, Google started off doing just a search engine and now you guys are doing a couple of things in addition to search, right? And so yes, but we do want to be able to expand to bring more people into that. Cause not everyone's going to be a programmer or a network engineer. Right? Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.

Speaker 5:          31:42          Hey, so thank you for taking the town and sharing your story. So what is success for inner city geeks into? What do you guys want to accomplish over time?

Speaker 2:          31:51          So success for intercity geeks and career Devs is pretty, pretty large. I always ask the question in a seems, it seems crazy when I hear it, when I hear the goal in my head, it sounds crazy. But when you think of John F. Kennedy was standing up and saying, [inaudible] in that New England accent, we're going to, by the end of this decade, we're going to put one man on the moon. Right? Or you look at the accomplishments of individuals and companies such as Google self driving cars.

Speaker 4:          32:29          Oh,

Speaker 2:          32:30          the work that's being done with tensor flow and machine learning and just all the advances that that's bringing out. Bringing about my goal is to, it's been talked about so much, but I really believe that in America we can set the example for having balanced income equality. Not everyone is going to be a Jeff Bezos or Larry Page or a Bill Gates, but you don't, you don't have to have large swaths of our society that are living in squalor. I believe that we can, in the impact that people have that are underserved and under skilled, they can contribute to the might of the American economic engine to make us an even stronger in greater country and that's not just for urban markets, but that's also for a suburban markets. W the principal from my high school, it says, oh no, we need you to come here to the Cape because we have those pockets of under skilled people here. And so it's not just an urban thing is to start a black thing or a Latino thing or a a white thing. There are poor people everywhere in this country, and that's my goal. My goal is to create balanced income equality. Well, thanks. Once again. I really appreciate the opportunity being here and we'll see you next time.
