Speaker 1:          00:06          I'm sorry is Marcus Collins and I am beyond excited to be with you guys. A little bit more about me. I've a professor at the Ross School of business. How about teaches marketing, farming go blues and absolutely a warm audience right now but that's actually the side kick. The full gig cause I work at an advertising agency called donor based in Southfield Eagle. I work in advertising. I'm not necessarily an appetizer by trade. I was an engineer Undergrad, ended up leaving engineering because it wasn't that fun for me. No offense to engineers in the room. They went to the music business before realizing as are getting a few sucks. So I came back to school and figure it all out and then went out to go work at apple, Beyonce in the advertising industry and right now in the space I'm working in is this notion of customer connections that is understanding the Bobby media landscape.

Speaker 1:          00:57          That is the technology that we use is shit's data about ourselves, which you guys know very, very well. Obviously understanding the behavioral sciences. It is the causality based theory that God's the behavior that we take one and lastly having a very close proximity to culture. Now I thought about coming to visit you guys to speak with you today. Is that, what did you tell Google? What do you talk about it the folks at Google and figure I talked to you about a very simple concrete concept perspective. Now I love perspective because we've talked about a lot and we all have one but really kind of boils down to this for me that things aren't the way they are. These are the way that we are. That is the way we see the world ought to be informed how we behave in the world, the lens that we have. I would just see the world influences the behaviors. Got me to take all that and the beautiful part about this is that we can look at the exact same thing for two told him perspectives is e two totally different things. Here's a way to tangibilize this tape for us is my guards Georgia whitetail deer. I guess she's the best and even when she's like this,

Speaker 1:          02:03          Georgia is a fish, like she loves to swim. I take full credit for this. My wife's over there because, but she was an infant. We took to the whole idea of one of these doctors check. There she goes. She gets some air time on the perfect. Yeah, no. Here's how I saw it. This is my perspective and I saw that. I know George in the air just a little bit. Nothing alarming. Just a little bit. Droid maybe she started a little bit higher and why? Why is

Speaker 2:          02:42          kill your child

Speaker 1:          02:44          so all the matter of perspective, the way you said the world wants me informs how you behave in the world. Now I talked to you about perspective, particularly about cultural now called just one of those words that we use often we talk about it and with the media and celebrities, like that's culture or if you're your company you saying we have a foosball table in the office. We have a great culture here. We absorbed summer Fridays. I have a great culture, but those things are bipods and culture. Culture. I make me buy it from the perspective of anthropology. Anthropologists describe culture base look for things. The other beliefs that we hold, they all of the artifacts that we died, the rituals, the social norms that we hear too in the language that we use, the lexicon, the dialect and when these four themes are adopted him on the plot as a people is there to represent their culture, right?

Speaker 1:          03:34          Getting tons of different ways and that best in their nationality, ethnicity definitely the religious they subscribe to and oftentimes the passion points that they hold dear. Right and we use iconography to describe and to project the cultures that we are part of the cultures that we ascribe too much like a peacock spreads is weeks to meet. We do the exact same thing when it comes to the brands that we hold dear. Now Look, you guys are smart. Obviously you said you like look is, this is totally obvious but the obvious use isn't top use until someone points it out to, for instance, say someone's going to get some headphones, headphones. I go into target. There's a long line of handball is all the headphones look the same. They all kind of have the same sort of shape. Which one are people most likely to buy? Beads, right? That just met, but we know. We know there's because beats is the Silhouette America, right? People need to listen to music using beats assistance artifact that we wear around our neck to say, this is who I am. These are the cultures that I subscribe to. Now the beats bear the bowls. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          04:43          Yes. It wasn't a die hard. I want you to know is beats bear to Jbl. They're my clients. Like definitely say no.

Speaker 1:          04:53          Right? In fact, a couple of years ago, someone dissected a pair of beats by dre headphones and power. Don't take $70 to make a beats by dre headphones. They will see their delight.

Speaker 2:          05:08          It's no wonder then

Speaker 1:          05:09          why they dominate the market. It's not because of the value propositions of the products is because of the brands prox that needs a culture because culture sidesteps all the conventional wisdoms that we know of or think about, we think about marketing is more powerful than my razor sharper. My battery last longer, my car goes faster, it has more body, my dealer would get too late. Right? It's more powerful than all those themes because culture is associated with your identity, the way we see ourselves and how we want to be seen as big. He once said, if you don't know what this is, Chris, a little bit tiles, right? Uh, what did they call it?

Speaker 2:          06:00          And we know that

Speaker 1:          06:05          Ms. Harding be introduced that language to us in her record. Hold on, go. Right, which wouldn't number one on billboard I killed, murdered, I'll be war. Right? That would be a burden on billboard when Cardi B with number one, the black yellow, she also saw a 217% increase in search traffic for crystal blue of the times, which was equate to about four point $5 million of media about the culture drives covers. And if you don't know, no, he has no, this is Jordan, right? It's okay. You should stop yourself. Store brand story. But what else does it called jump man. Jump Man. And he hit 2016 full jumped over John [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          06:54          Yeah, man, it's way into the culture back here. By the way, let me translate this for you.

Speaker 1:          07:02          Adidas boot for beating number three, shoe manufacturer, sneaker manufacturer in the country and over to brand Jordan in 2012 right? Kevin, number two and a lot of us is tribute to what they call the easy effect, kind of knit the easy's and just dominate things. It was also attributed to for rail in Stan Smith, right? And just actually Q 12 Adidas, Nike execute 12 cells. This isn't the first time we've seen this. We also saw it with run DMC. The impact on culture drives commerce. You guys know this guy, right? Of course you don't just got the most evil rapper best tossing myself, right? You can't go anywhere without hearing a drink. Predator drank is the guy and we know that Drake is very closely connected to his beloved city of Toronto and just recently in fact somebody acquainted the value of Drake on the economic power of tomato.

Speaker 1:          08:02          That tricks talking 5% of the economy. It's wrong because there's the six barbershop cause the sixth restaurant does the sixth Nelson Law and all of this language that was introduced by trade that is ridiculously powerful, unreal, powerful. This what culture does. This is the impact of culture. The beliefs that we hold, the artifacts that we've done, the behaviors we take on and the language that we use. This is culture with a capital c is this is just good pop potion. Dog Argue that American culture is hip hop culture like the evils of hip hop is. I came from nothing to something and I'm stunned knowing you is exact what I'm, every culture is pull us up by bootstraps now starting on you, right, which is no wonder why hip hop music is the number one most custom Java in the country. When we talk about cultural meat culture with a capital C for instance, go back to 2000 feet right in the middle of financial crisis, 2008 and you had an uprising of people who felt like capitalism was a very, very bad thing, so much so that they wanted to be counterculture.

Speaker 1:          09:09          We're going to be completely antithetical to the capitalistic culture that we lived in and we call these people affectionately hipsters. My hip was all about pushing against what we know of capitalism, pushing against what we know of adorning ourselves with material so we can express ourselves freely. They dawn, uh, artifacts that were irreverent. There are ironic in some cases, you guys bought cars, they bought ridiculous bikes and the whole nine, right? We're fixed rate the whole night. What was the drink of choice for hipsters, adult beverage stream choice. Pbr. Pbr. Right now why can we are cause is and the brand is all about your military museum. They're all about individual expression that eat those up. The brand was completely connected to what the hipster community, the hipster culture was all about. They found a uniting force based on the conviction that they both share and everyone who consider themselves a hipster, we're drinking PBR. Now you can look at that and say, wow, that's it. It's pretty good. It's pretty interesting. But the impact on [inaudible] business was through the roof hockey stick growth at the time of the uprising of this culture that we all call hipsters. So much. So attorney PBR until $1 billion business, which is ridiculous. And you can say that by, but what would the rest of the market doing? Let's tell you what the rest of our was doing. Everyone else was either declining or flat lining.

Speaker 1:          10:35          Well, PBI was murdered. You don't know. I didn't know. We also know this when we think about proposing, but we propose with the diamond, right? And why do both of the diamond,

Speaker 1:          10:49          I'm sorry, but it was the diamond question mark. Diamond diamond lasts forever. And who told us that? The beers. Yes. Beer say diamonds are forever. So if you love her, do you love your loved one? You're going to get a diamond and you know you've been up close with a ruby. She's like, you're going to get up close with the diamond because diamond's last forever because diamonds are forever. So much so that as much as long as you have that person save up three months of your salary to show the love, then this rock that lasts forever. Well, I'll tell you why the beers tells you that to last forever because the resale value for time is actually pretty awful. And they have a monopoly on of seemingly monopoly on diamonds. So they constrict the supply, it took their last rep or dope, they'll resell it because you'll see that this is bogus. And as a result, when this campaign hit the market in the 1930s you started to propose the diamond and we see the same thing happen in Japan and they rolled out the same campaign. Brands have an impact on culture and impacting commerce. And if you don't know, we also see this and think about smiles. You ever wonder why? Back in the day people were mean mugging and their photos and their portraits. And then today we can't stop smiling were all smiles, right? The Kanye has some issues with this.

Speaker 1:          12:22          No one can say, well that's because back in the day people's photos, it was pictures. We're taking the portrait and took a long time and you can't hold a smile. That law, like their face gets 15 muskeg tea and people kind of straight look the whole time. But even with the advent of cameras, people still to very grim grimace looking photos. This wasn't because of the technology, this is because of the culture. The belief at the time was that the idea of smiling and photos are in portraits was child life was halfwit. You're less thing. That was the belief, which is why the first federal, all of the standing president, they do like he belonged to a conference on there. I'm completely not happening. No Julie happening there and even at the turn of the century where cameras became much more ubiquitous and more people have access to them, we still didn't smell very much in photos.

Speaker 1:          13:16          So if you are a camera company that makes your business from people buying cameras and buying film and take a lot for lots of pictures, people think of taking photos as a serious business. They're not taking a lot of photos in that situation for you. So Eastman Kodak say, we got to change this up, man. We have to reposition how people think about what photos are meant to be. Say to just the idea of the Kodak moment, taking the photos about capturing, preserving these joyous moments. It's about preserving these moments that we have picked up love. So much saw that we say, Jeez, when we smile and take photos, completely changed. Not only the belief but the behavior. And fortunately when this rolled out the turn of the century, it measured very close to their line up very closely with a study that was done in one year were polls, well, it's up your photos over a century's time and measure the curvatures of faces in the fellows to see how often or how much people were smiling and we saw more and more, we smile.

Speaker 1:          14:16          This is what we do. Which is why that guy now looks like a, this kind of gun and the results of it was massive for coatings business. Almost $6 billion collected was 2005 unfortunately, they miss a cultural shift shift kind of play themselves. You know how that ended up right? That's a good, right? So why does this matter? Why does any of this matter? I tell you why it matters. It matters because France who could culture are more successful than those who follow. That is branching, push culture forward. Brands who contribute the culture almost [inaudible] file, they can ship it to the beliefs, the artifacts, but dawn, the lames were taking on behaviors. We take on the brands who lead that, push it forward and people use those brands that communicates with develop themselves. Whether it's apple, Nike, whole foods, Starbucks, people get tattoos of a Harley Davidson on your body.

Speaker 1:          15:12          You'll see my but I was not in his tattoo on her body. We use these brands to communicate our identity and we understand the impact of culture on commerce. We can then superimpose it with what we know of human behavior and this is what we're imposed that well, we know of people's behavior based on the shedding of data to take on and allow us to better connect with consumers. We know who the ability off. Here's a few examples of this in action. So Netflix is one of our clients at donor. And Netflix came to us and say, Hey, you want a lost into season five of house of cards. It's, you know, it's got a lot of momentum happening. Things are going well. Listen, this is in the middle of the most, the most divisive drama field election cycle we probably have ever seen, at least in our lifetime.

Speaker 1:          16:03          So how might we be a part of this cultural, how might we be a part of the conversation? So we took on the assignment and we say, well, what coal be could we lean into? What can we take advantage of? And the first thing we thought about was, well, the actual logo, the shell upside down, what and what does it upside down? One flag signaling distress. Exactly right. Culturally we know that upside down flag means trouble's a brewing help. So we thought what more opportune time then to launch the teaser for the season five, a house of cards, a new season. Then here. So during the inauguration of president Trump, uh, we launched this little ticket.

Speaker 2:          17:02          I don't have liberty and justice.

Speaker 1:          17:22          So zero media behind it, which I know it's not heard, these guys behind it. We saw 100,000 shares per hour for the first 18 hours of launching this thing. Not because it was so radical, but because it had a place in contribute to the culture, which allowed people to communicate how they feel, which is ridiculous. Really powerful. Now you can look at how the car to say, let's party culture development. That's a cheap as a cheat code. This is something that's not as culture development. Hopital I, he's will populate. Yes. Thank you. So potbelly potbelly for those who don't know what didn't say yes, papa as a sandwich shop, right? They sell sandwiches. Zell toasted sandwiches handed, uh, headed, uh, milkshakes and daily big cookies. Tm. Right? So that's, that's, that's pot belly. Now pop Bella came, as I said, we want to tell better stories about the brand.

Speaker 1:          18:17          We want to move from being this kind of like culty kind of iconic brand or coach Kinda brings what iconic brand bring more people in and so forth. We asked him, I was like, well, what do you believe? Like, why do you exist? What's the North Star that guides you? And they said, well, you know, we believe in fresh ingredients. We believe that tastier sandwiches. Like I didn't know that's what you do. Why do you do it? What's the belief? Very sinus setting kind of approach. You said, well you know, they'll know after spending some time with the CTL. Was Biz town founder promising? No, basically, I mean it sounds to me people happy and make people happy. Making these sandwiches. That made me happy. So it was happiness about, so we said, well there it is, then you're not in the business of making sandwiches. In the business of happiness was, we need to shift your perspective, the way you see the world from being in the sandwich business to be in the happiness business.

Speaker 1:          19:03          So we took their communications and Turner for being good food. Good vibes to be just mine, right? You'll just be to Belize. We'd be, the smiles were all about happiness. So the question now became so poor and we go after, what do we target are these guys don't have a lot of money, they just don't write whatever currency I have in my pocket right now is probably more than a marketing budget now about 20 books right now. A lot of money. So we thought, well let's start with the people who love you most. The people who are a part of your email distribution, they are the most ravenous fans. They love the brand. Who are those people? Unfortunately for us, they had a list of, they call them the sandwich board, New People when they sin rebates to the test, new products with them like this is like their people.

Speaker 1:          19:48          So we said give us those email addresses and we took those email addresses and we converted to the associating Twitter handles and the idea was like, let's find out who these people are beyond being hardcore sandwiched fans. So with Crimson Hexagon, which is a an AI consumer insight platform, we built this prototype and networking mapping tool that allow us to take those email addresses or it's 200 handles, don't them into the tool and see what these people have in common. Right? So this is a rendering of it. So we take these in all of these Twitter handles, don't them into the tool and we started seeing the connectivity between them, the clusters that you see our conversations not about sandwiches or how these are happening in their life that are happening in culture and things of that nature to get a better understanding of who those people are.

Speaker 1:          20:34          And in doing this exercise we saw four things, four names that were disproportionate to these people versus the rest of Twitter. And here's the rarely are the first one. There were hardcore sports fans and truly believe that was very discriminated because I like a lot of people like sports. So I was like, ah, don't know we had any right to be part of that. Then we saw Christians and he was like hardcore, like Joel Olsen, happy Christmas. What does break is a happy brand or the client. I think we answered that. So we kept them. We saw some tech start up, some Martech in particular, the way it feel like what we had any right to be here. Part of that. But then we saw, and we'll talk about music now again, music is not very discriminating. Everyone likes me is I haven't haven't been somewhat in life.

Speaker 1:          21:17          We said I hate music because we need that person. There are monster stay away. Everyone likes music. So it's not very discriminating on the surface, but we look closer to the things that are being shared. We saw it, they were sharing soundcloud files, which is really small in comparison to Spotify or youtube or very, very small. So that was up to for discriminating get particularly sound cloud. These aren't usually signed. Ours. Underground artists is a way to discover you artists. So we felt that music is probably a good avenue for us to get into the culture, particularly because we have live musicians who play during lunch. So now we got away in. So we came up with some ideas with the client and we pitched the idea is that we love that, that, that, that give you some of that. And the idea was like, let's go test and stuff.

Speaker 1:          22:07          Now usually you get a focus group of people, let's look at the work and say I like that and I'll buy that because I liked that work. What's typically, they're all lying because self reported data is terribly flawed, at least biased. So instead of asking people, cause we didn't have money to get it wrong, what does that to ask their bodies. So you part of the Michigan states, you advertise in a psychology lab and we volume respondence to look at the work that we were proposing in a full Facebook like environment. So he saw some regular content and then the work that we're proposing. So regular content in the work that we're proposing and all of these respondents were there tracking or taking their physiological response, swept lambs, heart cardio activity or respiratory activity. Um, eye tracking, zygomatic muscle, which can smile muscle. And we were at Trinity, but we knew of the psychological drivers to those physiological manifestations and the work that performed the best. That's the work we put in the market,

Speaker 3:          23:08          making great sandwiches that make people really, really happy. It's Papeles mission, but how do you own that position in the social sphere when your annual revenue is less than your competitor's ad budget? We mounted data tech and genuine happiness to feed smiles across the web. First, we set our sights and arguably the most unhappy place ever. Twitter, there were a partnership with Crimson Hexagon in AI powered consumer insights platform. We identified a hundred sad tweets and had pot belly musicians respond with a hundred original happy songs in real time, all during one lunch day. Turn that frown upside down when we learn Pollis fish died. We entertained her with this. Sorry to get about your fish at mag moles fell out of a tree. Yeah, it's sweet. I'm glad. No matter the problem, we had a happy response. Just going to tell you you all the very best.

Speaker 3:          24:06          He flooded Twitter with smile songs and Twitter. Wow. They smiled back with the good vibes didn't end there. We helped entire cities in need of happiness by creating the smile scale. A one of a kind algorithm that synthesizes everything from weather and traffic data to results from major sporting events and social media happenings across key cities than automatically serves customized pieces of content. If it's raining in Dallas, they get this. If traffic is bad in Chicago, they see this and if Detroit's favorite baseball team loses, we cheer them up with this. The results, 10 times more brand engagements, 20 times more Twitter followers. Overall we spread happiness to more than 16 million people. That's a whole lot of smiles.

Speaker 1:          24:58          The more important part of this is that with only $60,000 media spin, we saw 2.8% increase a store fabric for the stores that we did. The smile scale occupations, which is ridiculously powerful. Right? It's crazy crazy. Taking what we know of behavioral sciences, applying them to what we normally welcome to the landscape and finding a vehicle and access licensed to be a part of culture. Now, Netflix kind of sexy pop valley, not so much, but sort of fun. Let's get like really brass tacks like CPG. But this is not sexy by any stretch. Let's Talk Pharma. The Pharma, so far, my, their apartment in fracture, right? They Bacon. Awesome. Delicious. Right now you're looking at an import manufacturer like farmland. You say, well, there's nothing cool about Pharma. So soft farmland is a praying together. They have no interaction whatsoever. The hypebeast like supreme and a port factual like format.

Speaker 1:          26:02          A lot of people don't know about what would they have in common? Probably like, I don't know. So the question becomes then what do you do? Or what could be done? Typically nothing until a brand like supreme. Jack's your logo. So supreme, notorious for taking other people's Ip and conquest in it for their own. Uh, they took the local compliance and we saw this like what do they do? What do you think? It's illegal. You can't do this, let's a brain. But what they can, because they're gonna do whatever you want to do. And in those cases you have three choices. You could either litigate, but as you'll see some assist you get us. Ignore it most. Most people do because suffering doesn't care. Or third, you could join it as we decide to do the guys from Stock X.

Speaker 4:          26:53          Imitation is the highest form of flattery. Then supreme is truly a world class kiss ass. The legendary street wear company has a long history of borrowing designs from other brands and last week they added another instinct classic. So their legacy, the week one horizon has dropped it without much fanfare, despite bearing a striking resemblance to the farm land bull to logo and Missouri based pork producer, probably be least hypebeast company on earth. That wasn't until Friday when the ad roll business giant took to Twitter and called out the apparent forgery causing horizon at prices to immediately pop. The hats went from $70 before the tweet to as much as $100 after a 40% increase over night. Proving once again that street where loves a scandal and controversy is the cousin of hype turning off, it'll be gay.

Speaker 1:          27:46          So we saw them Chakra, a logo responding in sweet. And uh, somewhat surprisingly like Twitter crazy like Yo, lots of energy, lots of excitement. But we didn't stop there because we knew that car you hit Supreme's I'll do another drop the following week. We just have to do our own drop. That is farm land opened up an Instagram handle and we traded a look book where we don our

Speaker 5:          28:14          farmers.

Speaker 1:          28:18          Our farmers are out there doing what they do decked out here.

Speaker 5:          28:25          Okay.

Speaker 1:          28:25          All right. As the trades were saying, we out supreme supreme just got picked up and culture got picked up in the trades. It's got pick up in the hype piece still just amazing, amazing stuff. This is good. See everybody the best, uh, the best payback to base that was done the last couple months. But this is really where it's at. How did we find what we know of human behavior? We know the evolving media landscape though we know of culture to connect with people in a real meaningful way. I think about my job ultimately is to translate culture for brands and they translate brands for the culture in such a way that they connect, enroll meaningful ways. And luckily I have a chance to do that with some of the biggest brands in the world, which has been awesome. No, that's me. But why does that matter for you?

Speaker 1:          29:11          I tell you what matters for you because cultural, I was getting much closer to humanity to connect with people in a really meaningful way and what the literature is showing us more and more the research is demonstrating that people care less about the product benefits and care more about emotional connection. Our ability to connect with humanity matters. Mormon, how Sarma right. Three is how long our battery last, how much body is in our sample. People care about human connections and also drives a cash register. We just pretty good but it's also better to you individually as well. I tell you what, you know, especially for people who are just starting their career or new meal fights in their career, trying to figure it out were costly to try to find a way to our game. What's our strategic advantage at work so I can rise up the ranks so I can be more successful and I would argue that understanding cultural is a really powerful way to do that because like I know, I know you're surprised, but I used to get in back in the day [inaudible] I was a songwriter for a living.

Speaker 1:          30:20          I released music. That's why I did. I used to form opened up for what 12 jagged edge Gisa call like those days are behind me. I have a three and a half year old attorney for for and 14 and it seems like I am my wife and my daughter. We live on a cul de sac and sometimes we're matching outfits to get forward them on to our sandwiches are like really, really hard to be a part of it culture. But for a lot of you, especially you, y'all know about Kodak did a good bit of a pullback kilo. A lot of people, articles, culture. If that becomes your superpower, that becomes your differentiator. You think about your career, how do you succeed in the world of marketing? You love it to culture because brands will be cultural. The and follow. You have that power right now, especially those who are close to it. You know, if like this guy, you have all the tools available to you, most of the culture, stay close, stay close to the culture and stay curious. This would be the differentiator that helps your brands succeed by pushing the contrary to the culture, pushing it forward. Hope this is helpful. Thanks so much

Speaker 5:          31:35          [inaudible].

Speaker 6:          31:42          Thanks for coming. I always tried to get into your class and Ross, but I never had enough big toys. I'm curious if you could get any examples of brands and trying to be like the culture center, but then it ends up backfiring. Um, and it's a sort of the worst.

Speaker 1:          31:57          I mean unfortunately there were more examples of that and they are good examples. Probably the most ubiquitous might've been gov is a Pepsi to a cultural moment and make it about people to made about that. And it turned to a meme that was piled on their base. Right. And then really the issue there is that they'll keep playing Pepsi. They weren't dog who is smart people. Nda is from grade schools, right? Smart people. It wasn't, they were dominant as completely oblivious. They just more closer to the culture. They didn't understand the shared beliefs, the artifacts, the social norms, the unwritten rules, the legs that they use. And it's the lack of understanding of the nuances that gets you off step. You don't understand the nuances, that's when you play yourself. So the idea is to stay very, very, very, very close to the culture and all times requires from being a part of the culture as opposed to being a tourist. Right. That the day we used to call it ethnographic studies, right. But getting away way in.

Speaker 7:          32:56          Yep.

Speaker 1:          32:57          Marcus, I think I saw an example like a week ago of something you're talking about with blood disease. You see the tweet that when he set out to where they were kind of dogging the Nebraska coaches name is frost. Um, and they said you have frosty, which gives meeting white 40 nothing at halftime and they put out a tweet during half time and I'm Mexican. You know what's going viral? I see it on the national news, I see it on ESPN, you know, um, it's a good brass offense. We're not happy because they said, hey, you know, we, you know, when these two and then Wendy's on their official like Twitter handle said, we're pretty sure that, you know, the grass is, have a sense of humor. Some of them were still on the, and they said, well, we based our period geodesic partners. Yes, it was crazy.

Speaker 1:          33:43          Again, wow, we've got to talking about their food, but then all of a sudden a lot of people are going, I'm going to go eat at Wendy's. I just love that they got the courage to kind of get out there and caused some trouble. Think I winkies without being very, very close to a business. I think Wendy's bigger or number three, and this makes, why not throw some shots and their entire strategy at this point pretty much about the trolling everybody else. We've got 12 and you don't get hurt. Come on. [inaudible] at all. And considering this is a part of their needles now, people don't make less urine from the basket. Uh, people have had pretty big skin becomes that sort of thing, but they are, they're hugging all the right nuance of the culture they're part of. And we see things getting shader, we're going viral because people who believe the same thing that Wendy's does, their take on things people share also, right? It's all about community. Community is another way of talking about the cultures that were a part of it.

Speaker 8:          34:39          You see a lot of um, how you around like Youtube, collaboration's Instagram collaborations, these kinds of integrations that brands are trying to do. I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on on that and whether that's actually getting close to them

Speaker 1:          34:54          culture or if it's sort of counter so, and so I like as far as like taking advantage of a platform to do things

Speaker 8:          35:01          right or, or more like the collaborations with the creators on those platforms.

Speaker 1:          35:05          So, so I, I'd say this, my thinking about the technology, the technology and the Zeros and ones if you will, the Zeros and ones are the facilitators of networks, right? Things that normally be disparate are now connected things to day to day. That that goes from one node to the next. Um, so same sort of thing. And what we find when we extrapolate that, and I want to talk about the network of things, that network of people and things, what some of the network of people and people and things like Instagram, Facebook, social networking platforms are connecting people who see the world similarly, we're all my affiliate and we connected. That is they share the same beliefs. Social norms, break written rules and rituals. So think when brands partner with black forms technologies who understand the dynamics of the network, the dynamics of the culture, they, they borrowed approximately, right? They borrow. The people know the culture better than Nate too, to get them closer to it. That's massively powerful. The idea though is that it's always going to be an outsource skills as I have the capability of the brand, right? Capabilities about repeatability and reliability. Not to outsource that, that I really don't have it, which is good because they get a chance a couple of at bats to do something powerful. But it's a challenge for them because it's not really inside the eagles were the brand is all about.

Speaker 6:          36:23          Sure. So if you're not a part of the culture that you're trying to get close to and you can run ethnography, ethnographic studies. Yeah, either tools they're available to us. I mean, I'm actually thinking of an advertiser, a group that I work with as aftermarket auto, so it's exact opposite gender, different age range, different lifestyle entirely, but I want to get to know that a little bit worried Smidley so it's good ideas for tools we can tap into.

Speaker 1:          36:52          Well, I know one is called Google did, which is why it's so important to understand the evolving media landscape, social listening, search behavior, viewership behavior. We get a sense it's a proxy to what people do, what they believe, where they go. They talk about what they believe. We know what they were. We don't artifacts like dogs, any pictures of them. These things provide a proxy that we normally would have to go move with the coal miners, Noah coal miners do. Instead we can see them from a distance and a short sort of bursts. Well a large representation of the population that we can pull a sample world stage. I'll say this is the real thing. Right? And it's not really defined by demography is that defined by psychographics either is defined by the beliefs that we hold, the behaviors we strive to, the language that we use in tech, like search, like social listening.

Speaker 1:          37:46          Those needs provide a bird's eye view as be normally wouldn't have access to without a ton of resources. And I realized like my ex caliber of sorts is Google trends it crimson hexagon, I use it for everything to bet on people. Right. I can't, I have clients across a wide spectrum. Google after different culture have different networks. So it requires me to be able to cold switch between them and I can't do all that. Right. I can't be that close to all of them. So I can either use people work with it. They work the agency who are close to the culture while you use some proxy via the tech ops

Speaker 6:          38:21          with the social listening tools. Sorry, I assume those are like paid subscription. So I'm more thinking, you know, we, we know the wealth of Google tools that we have at our disposal are there, are there free social norms? Dooley's Twitter advanced search. Okay, cool.

Speaker 1:          38:34          Super free. Like it's not as robust as using premise it or uh, or hootsuite or something like that. But it's free. It gives you a nice down and dirty look at what's going on. Super Representative of a sample of people. Absolutely. Yeah. My question is, you know, like I know we'll have seen like the Nike just do it campaign for example. And so I guess my question is like when making a decision to launch a campaign like that, when it might be considered well and that might be considered, some would consider it to be, um, you know, culturally, um, polarize this or how do you, how do you go, what, how does a company make what decision making built into that? So I get that, well, it's got to conviction. What do you believe, right. Simon Sinek would say, why have you exists? People don't buy what you do.

Speaker 1:          39:19          They buy why you do it. Right. What do you believe? And I think the biggest opportunity for brands aren't attacking to networks who share the same belief as the brand because those are the brands we use to communicate. This is who I am, this is how I see the world. Right? And conviction by its very essence requires saying no to things. It required two and think that may be dismissive to people grown into the world's way. You do. And the fact that night she was like, no, we're standing with copper nick, because he aligns to our belief system. And if you don't rock with that, then you don't rock with us. And also people were burning their Nike's and say, I'm never going to buy another pair of Nike's. You're going to die. Nike or your company sucks for the people who believe when Nike believes in Stanley copy as well, what they say, getting two pair, right?

Speaker 1:          40:04          I want more. I'm a buy more because this theme is representation of our belief. So you know, it's difficult. It's, it's, it is a simple idea, but it's not easy. And we often confuse simplicity and ease, right? Like losing weight. This is a simple idea. Don't eat so much, move more personably. Anthony's right in. The same thing goes with convictions for brands like what do you really believe? If you believe that, we will stand up for that when everyone else is sitting down, when everyone else is, it gets you where you stand up for it. That is what conviction is all about and the branch who have very clear as salient convictions. Now, little do people know what they believe in. Therefore they use those brands but all their actions or communication, people that they hire, those people come towards the brand. I mean that's the idea. That branch should have conviction on just where they communicate but also within the organization so that people who are part of the organization, they believe and they to preach the Gospel and they to our democracy representations of the brand's conviction, et Cetera, did.

Speaker 1:          41:16          This is about the nuances of the culture. Like it's a hard one to say. Um, we pay mind to the nuances. We feel like it's a real thing if people know the nuances. When someone is saying there's appropriate like no, you don't understand because the brain has always been a part of this. Here are all the Demassio representations, the evidence that shows this brand's always been this way. So then doing this is not a, is that the new, this is writing a lot of people always been about, but you got to be about it. Like what did he say? Don't talk about it. Be about it. Right. The same thing.

Speaker 1:          41:49          Okay. Um, so I'm really big on like influencer marketing. So like I know in the past sophomore year with, we don't say, um, job to her, um, little media formation and she mentioned red lobster and like, after that, like sales increased like people are going to relapse to. And then like, just like last week, Kylie Jenner, she put on her snapchat, she had milk for the first time in her milk, just like posted and like all these things. So my question is, is like, should companies or brands like continue to ride that wave and like use that celebrity or influenced her to, um, promote their brands, like chat to tap into other influencer, other culture? I'll start this and I'll answer your question with a step back and then we'll step into it. Is there first, it's like unpacking this idea of influencers, right? So we think of like the Kylie Jenner's, the Beyonce is the Kanye is the broadest influencers and they have influence, but the lecturer described their influence as ideological influence.

Speaker 1:          42:52          That is, we look up that we aspire to that, but we don't compare ourselves to it. Like we don't hear Connie likes talking about where it has been. We, and then we get our Toyota like, I suck at life, takes all, he has the most money in the guard, paint our paycheck or I hate myself. You don't do that. We compare ourselves to people who are like us, people who were part of the same network that we're part of our peers. Um, so when I think about influencers at that level, like they're basically contextualized medium, they're bright wattage media, but those aren't, but they're, their media isn't what makes behavior stick. It's your people which makes behavior stick. One would say that culture moves forward. The basis of, one simple question, do people like me do something like this? The answer is yes, I do it.

Speaker 1:          43:37          The answer is no, I don't. It would make a decision hundreds of times a day. People like me do something like this, so say I see Jay z where a super cool hat and I'm like, that's dope ass shoes a match it I'm buying that happened, right? I go by the hat and I go to lunch with my friends and I sit at lunch and they're like, what are you wearing? Like you're like, you're like an idiot. Take that hat off. What am I going to do? I'll take that hat off. Put it in the closet has never seen the light of day. Right? Our people are what makes the things stick because our people are the people that we want to be connected to. As Aristotle was saying, we're social animals by nature. So do everything we can to connect people who are just like us.

Speaker 1:          44:15          They scratch the same beliefs, say social norms, same old rules, and they use the same language, right? So I think about how we leverage influence in this way. Well, we leverage the media that they provide for sure. Right? Well, we have to make sure that there is some concurrence that is, there's a lot of visibility that people like me doing that thing, right? Like Beyonce says he does any good I take is to red lobster, right? And it wasn't a bit like meeting to the girls, all, you better take me to red lobster, right? People like me do this. And then I'm like, yeah, I'm gonna do this as well. And it'd be, it creates the cultural weight that allows us to propagate across the network. So the answer, the short answer is yes, absolutely. As long as it aligns to what the brand's is all about. Well, what's the most important is how do we get it to propagate across the social web to these networks of people, these communities. So that the behavior stick is difference between like going viral and be culturally contains the names just spread person to person, kind of Peter out. But it spreads from person to person. It takes hold culture, unpacking our beliefs, behaviors, artifacts, language, which was doing my doctoral research. Thank you. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          45:24          Good. Some very respected brands. So I'm curious, um, what is your main criteria before he decided to say yes or no to a client or a project?

Speaker 1:          45:32          Uh, so I don't make the calls on the scope of work that the agency says is deemable, but for me to work on the products there, there's things that come into the building that my teammates have. Sky You don't touch. Um, and unfortunately I'm, I'm going to place my career. I can say no, not another festival statements. Um, I tried to take it, we'll see a wave. I don't do the tobacco at all. Um, and I try to stay away from alcohol particularly because I'm consuming. Right. And you know, I've worked with me, I work was one of our clients. Um, just the building. While there may be some, uh, somebody have issue with Mcdonald's. I don't. Right. Um, but if it has request for years, for four years, and I've never tasted the product at all, right? At that time I couldn't say dope bro. Once my broker and say no today, I'd say no thank you. Just because this describes it does it in a line to my beliefs. There's a line to what I like to do and me, it'd be hard for me to sleep at night telling people to consume more, some more, some more tobacco completely against, and therefore, I won't even tell us this stuff. But again, it's just the,

Speaker 6:          46:37          I had a question about what you've done, who you've been apart of brands or they're going to be, the competitor has totally crushed it. Like you're working Miller and QVR sales are completely skyrocketing. The move usually till it, right on their success or take the complete opposite stance.

Speaker 1:          46:53          I think it depends on where the brand is. So if you're the market leader and these guys are skyrocketing up, you don't want to put the spotlight on those guys. In most cases. It's kind of like that's the, uh, that will be, that's the conventional wisdom. I think about it. Like are we Drake and push it to you? We're beefing out this summer, right? Drink is like here, Pusha t is not as high as far as the claim. Right? Um, who's t throws jabs at Drake, Drake response can push it to use rubber sales go up. So all times will be the market leader. Your job is just to say that the, if your job is to grow the market rolling category, someone throw shots at you or someone's rising up, just make sure that you keep the category growing until they become too close to call. In those cases you find ways to the door of that sometimes acquisition. Um, and then sometimes it's finding ways to to blot.

Speaker 6:          47:47          Have you been a part of the branch strategy that has successfully combat at a major spike in a competitor?

Speaker 1:          47:53          Um, I would say so. State farm, right? So state farm, they are the market leader by far. But you see a lot of market share being acquired by particularly the Geicos in the world insurance progressive. All state. So state farm, like how do you keep the category growing, which the category is sort of, um, if it's sort of self moving because it's obligatory. If you want to drive this country, you need all of these rooms, right? But how many people to get on as soon to get it with us, get a financial services and kid with us while these other guys are coming to the market. So we found ways to use culture to continue to boost the brand and broaden the aperture of the category. Particularly during the clip Paul Campaign for state bar. Right? So instead of talking about how we're barely in state hub, we're better than Geico. We just talked about how great the state farm is that helping you with the magical age and like the neighbor state farm, is there a shows up or personify? What happens when you have an agent? What's the only clip, Paul? Right. Chris Ball. All Star, state farm. All of our all star point guard who throws assist on the court, Flip Paul All star state farm agent. There was a system, real life, all these things to manifest. What the brand is all about so that we can grow, grow as presence. Thank you. Got It.

Speaker 6:          49:11          So I'm kind of interested in the brainstorming and then zeroing in on what we're going to do process. Uh, the example of Potbelly's she just talked about and um, you're gathering data, you're trying to understand what the brand really wants to go to. We're not just like sandwiches but happiness. What does brainstorming look like? And then how do you say, okay, this is what we're going to go for. It cause going to watch a commercial. I'm like, I can't imagine someone in the room being like, Hey, this is what we're going to go. I'm just wondering what it looks like to brainstorm and then make that decision on kids is what we're going to move forward.

Speaker 1:          49:43          Radical simplicity. Just get radical, radical, radical simplicity. So brokers ask is brings is what do we believe as a brain? How do we see the world in the world of I'm only behave in the world. So what do we believe? And once we realize what the why is, what the conviction of the brand is, now we know who we're targeting. People who see the world way we do, right? So now we know who we are and how they're going after work or who we went after. The next question is what do we want them to do? Cause Marketing's one of those words that we use, uh, full of jargon. Distractions, buzzwords, right? Like, well, it's marketing asked 10 people get 20 different answers. So I think about marketing as radically splits in simplistic as possible. Uh, old Oxford dictionary defines marketing is going to market like parking is going market the market.

Speaker 1:          50:28          Being people with the core of marketing get people to adopt behavior. So we know what we're all about as a brand. We know who we're going after. Now the question is what do we want people to do? And all the messages, communications, campaigns, uh, products, activations, they're all designed to get people to move as simple as possible. All the other things that we built on and the implications and what not we can get into. But it all starts with who are we? Who are we going after? What behavior within the table? My pleasure. Thanks so much. [inaudible].
