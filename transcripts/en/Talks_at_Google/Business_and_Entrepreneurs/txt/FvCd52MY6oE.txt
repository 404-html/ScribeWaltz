Speaker 1:          00:06          Hi everyone. Welcome to talks at Google and it's great to have Sandy, Jen co founder and Cto of honor here with us today. Sandy founded honor in 2014 and prior to that she was cofounder and Cto of Meebo, which is a customer internet company that focused on connecting publishers and consumers socially and she led their engineering team and then join Google actually, uh, in the social team when a Meebo was acquired in 2012 and before that she also got her bs from Stanford University in computer science. So it's great to have you with us today, Sandy. Great fear. I like to get started by having you tell us about what honor is in your own words.

Speaker 2:          00:56          Sure. Um, so honor, uh, our mission basically is to change the way that our parents age. Um, I think aging is a topic that a lot of us don't talk about with people, especially our own parents. Um, there's a bit of sort of child fear, um, when talking about, uh, issues like that. And so honors goal really is to remake the way that folks can, uh, age at home specifically. Um, so we really focus on nonmedical home care, which means that we help folks with a, what we call Adl. So activities of daily living, things that you and I take for granted, you know, brushing your teeth, getting out of bed. I went to the bathroom. Um, and we have a whole host of, um, really awesome care professionals that go and do that work.

Speaker 1:          01:37          And what inspired you and your team to start? Honor?

Speaker 2:          01:40          Uh, good question. Um, so, uh, uh, three of the four founders are multiterm entrepreneurs and so we've, um, we all kind of cut her teeth on social media. Um, I've actually had been at Google for a little bit, um, and we, uh, once we sort of, you know, so all those companies and sort of took a little time off and we merely wanted to do another venture and we really wanted to think about, okay, well what would make us really want to work hard, like really, really hard because the startups are a lot of work. Um, and, uh, we ended up sort of thinking about what's important to us. And we were a little bit older or a little bit more chairs, some of us were having kids. Um, and we really wanted to have impact. That was like the biggest thing. And so, um, when we were kind of getting together, we kind of thought about, okay, well what, like what are big problems that we could solve?

Speaker 2:          02:25          And we thought about unemployment, poverty, you know, Labor, uh, child care, health care, elder care. Um, and then my cofounder from evo went home one day, um, to Connecticut to visit his mother. And she, uh, he likes to tell the story that she gets speeding tickets in Montana, which you just don't get cause cause there's nobody monitoring center. The freeways in Montana. And she was driving really slowly. And so he started to get a little freaked out about like, wait a minute. Like, why are you driving so slowly? And she was like, well, it's just getting a little harder. And so he's like, I live in California, you live in east coast, you know, when you're older, what am I going to do? Um, I know I don't want to pluck you away from your house. And so that sort of spurred the idea. We kind of really started to do some research in caring for seniors and it's a really, really big space. Um, and then we really honed in on the nonmedical a home aspect of it because it was very broken. Um, and when you find him that's really broken as an entrepreneur, you kind of get really excited cause you're like, oh, what can I help? What can I do to fix this? Um, and so we kind of started explore that idea.

Speaker 1:          03:30          How do you feel like your experience working on Meebo in the social space has influenced your work here with honor?

Speaker 2:          03:36          Um, so I would say doing a previous or prior startup to doing honor was definitely a Prereq to do this type of venture. Um, honor is complicated. Like home care aid, you're touching people directly. Uh, it's a very, very, uh, hands on experience. Um, and so in order to solve such a big mission, you need to sort of know how to execute, how to, you know, gather resources higher, like a lot of the sort of nuts and bolts that I learned in my first startup. And so my experience at Meebo really sort of taught me generally how to form organizations, how to run a team, how to hire. Um, there are a lot of mistakes we made in Meebo, which, um, as an entrepreneur are selfishly for a second venture. I want to feel to not make the same mistakes twice. Um, so it was a good opportunity to just kind of take all the learnings that we had, um, sort of gathered in our previous experiences and then, you know, really consolidate all that learning into a new venture. Um, and so, so far it's worked out really well.

Speaker 1:          04:38          And how long have you guys been available to consumers? Actually,

Speaker 2:          04:41          so we started, uh, we're about three years old, but we've been giving care for about two. Um, and so the first year, obviously a lot of us didn't know much about home care. Um, like I, you know, I had some personal experiences with, with my grandparents, but, um, really digging into the industry. It's been around for a really long time. It hasn't changed much in 30 years, but there are a lot of nuances and complications and considerations in home care that, uh, without really doing it, you don't really get exposed to it. And so the first year for us was a ton of learning and then we started to take those learnings and execute on them.

Speaker 1:          05:17          Okay. Prior to the interview, I was just reading on this market and it's actually like a huge business opportunity in terms of how much money people spend on home care and here, but it's something that I don't think tech has addressed up to this point. Why do you think that is?

Speaker 2:          05:32          Yeah, so it's, it's interesting cause people think technology, they think old people and they're like, this is just don't mix. Um, and the way we've thought about it is, um, you know, if you think about your grandparents or your loved ones who are older, like they use microwaves and twisters and TVs and cars. Um, and that's all technology, but it's not in their face as like technology. And so you had to sort of rethink about how you use tech to address needs for that kind of audience. And so for us, I think there's just been that stigma I think in silicon valley and just generally in technology and as a whole that seniors don't do well with technology. Um, and I think there's always been these, I think it's a mistake to kind of overcater to a senior audience by having like giant buttons and like giant Font and you know, basically treating them as children, um, without really understanding what the root problem you're trying to solve.

Speaker 2:          06:25          And so we definitely don't think of ourselves as a technology company like honors specifically positioned itself as a services company. Because at the end of the day, our product is a person. Um, and I say this very often that we are a human services company, like the person that we send to your home to help, you know, you do your, uh, activities of daily living. That's our product. And so all the technology that we build, um, is in service of that. So a lot of stuff that we build, the end consumer never sees, but it's completely built to deliver the best care possible.

Speaker 1:          06:56          What was the hardest part of the process as you were starting out with this company?

Speaker 2:          07:00          Um, I think, uh, as technologists, you have this sort of, uh, want to automate everything and make everything really efficient. Um, and so you come in with a blog, a bunch of assumptions. And so as engineers, we're like, okay, we're just going to build this thing. We're going to build that thing. This is the way it works. You just go to visit, you do this, you do that, and then when you actually start to do it, we all ended up volunteering in senior homes to help out and you're like, wow, that's not, that's not how it is. Um, and so, uh, we had to basically learn to strip away all of our assumptions. Um, and, uh, in the very beginning, you know, we had folks who were running care and delivering care and working with our care, our care professionals. Um, and they were kind of doing one thing and then the engineers and product team, we're kind of doing another thing and we were trying to build things for each other, but we weren't really in sync as much as we should have been. Um, and I think that's a common problem because you make assumptions, you work one way, you make some geo work one way, but at the end of the day you really have to work together, like really, really together to understand what's going on. And so once we kind of figured out that we were not building the right thing, um, that sort of changed the course of how we did product development, which I think is different than what you'd find in a more traditional software technology company. Um, we really had to sort of rethink how we did that.

Speaker 1:          08:17          You mentioned that you went to visit some senior homes. What else did you do in terms of use or research or validating the product and getting feedback on the product?

Speaker 2:          08:25          Yeah, so we knew we didn't know anything really. So, um, and uh, if you think about home care, it's basically two sided. You have Washington multi-sided, you have the person receiving the care so that the recipient of the care recipient who could be older or have different medical conditions, um, you have usually a family member. Um, sometimes not who might be the one responsible for helping care for the, the, the senior. Um, and then you have the person who was actually doing the care. So the care professional, um, they're traditionally called caregivers, but we really wanted to raise their profile. Um, and so we there and the work they do is really difficult. So we actually called the care professionals, um, and then care pros for short to give them sort of more of the respect that they actually deserve. Um, and so we had to basically talk to everybody.

Speaker 2:          09:12          So we, we put herself out of the bay area cause a barrier is kind of weird. Um, as you won't know, it's a little bit of a bubble. So we went to like different areas, talk to different care pros, you know, asking them sort of, you know, what does it you do, you know, what's hard in your life? Um, why do you do this work? Um, you know, they could, a lot of folks who at this wage level could literally make more, you know, flipping burgers at Mcdonald's, but they choose to do this work because they really care. So it's like, like, why are you making a decision? I'm like, what are the hardships in your life? Um, why do you work for this agency and not that agency? Um, and so just really being open to understanding how their thinking. Um, and then when you start to get the same answers over and over again, then you start to think, okay, now I'm seeing a pattern and trend. And that can then inform the product that you build and how you want to create that interaction. Hmm.

Speaker 1:          10:03          Your comment about the wages that the caregivers are earning reminded me that I saw the CNN article that mentioned that in 2016 you transitioned from a contractor model to an employee model. Is that something that continues to today and why they choose to do that?

Speaker 2:          10:18          I think in the beginning were like, all right, we're just going to kind of try the contractor model because you know, that's sort of, it seems to easiest. Um, and so we started recruiting people and then it turns out that there are certain restrictions in a contractor model that you, uh, for example, can't train your folks very well. Um, there are certain limitations on the amount of, um, sort of personal interaction you can have with them. And so the one of our core tenants has always been, if you could treat the care pro better and put them in a better place in their lives, they'll be able to do their jobs better, right? Because if you're, if you're like not happy at home and you're trying to make ends meet, you're not going to be able to care for people very well. And so, um, one of the things that we heard over and over again from care pros was that they, you know, they might get a 25 cents increase in their hourly wage after staying with an agency for like three years.

Speaker 2:          11:12          Um, there's no performance, like based, uh, reward. There's no way to know that who's a good care of her, who's a bad care pro. And so one of the things that we thought would be really cool and that they, they sort of were asking for was some way to develop your career as a care professional is a caregiver. Um, and so the only way you can really do that though is to give them signals as to what they're doing really well and what they're doing not so well what they can improve on. And then you can train. And so one of the he reasons we did, we started to make the switch to an employee model was that with employees you can actually train and develop and like really invest in them as people and like as workers. Um, and so that was one of the primary reasons we decided to make that change. And they're still employed today. So,

Speaker 1:          11:55          so then you mentioned the valley took care givers. If we look at this in comparison to traditional senior care centers or senior care models, what value do you add to the other key players? So then in this case, the, maybe the seniors themselves or also maybe the family members who are, uh, buying the care for their senior?

Speaker 2:          12:17          Yeah, so, um, the current industry is very fragmented. So, uh, if you think about anything like over the con and the nationwide, there's something like 40 to 50,000 agencies. Um, it's not because like no one's ever tried to make up a large agency. It's just really hard. Um, you have a bunch of people on the demand side, so all of your seniors needing care and like, you know, they'll say your grandmother might have a bad hip and you know, this chronic medical condition and she's allergic to dogs and she requires someone who can lift someone out of bed every morning. Or my mother or grandmother might meed to speak Mandarin and she's allergic to cats and she, you know, has three sets of stairs. So you need somebody who will lift her downstairs said. So the requirements for people are Super Heterogeneous. And then on the demands on the supply side, like care pros are also very heterogeneous.

Speaker 2:          13:08          Like this person that might be able to lift 200 pounds, but this were some may not this person pieces language. This person can only drive five miles outside of her home because she has two kids that she needs to pick up after work. Um, and so there are all these sort of stipulations on both sides. And so doing a match is actually really difficult. And so, uh, if you are a small mom and pop agency, which a lot of these, these, these places are, you don't have the logistical, operational, sort of like technology brain to do that because you're trying to do it on your head. So you might have a staff of a few people trying to like match all these things. And so, um, a lot of it is also very analog. So I care pros, we'll literally have to take a telephone in the morning and said, okay, what am I going to go?

Speaker 2:          13:50          Um, they'll, they'll literally take their notes per visit on like a spiral bound notebook with the tensile and they'll leave it on the desk. Um, and so, uh, we also talked to folks who, you know, who run agencies with the little, they drive around to all their clients, pick up those notebooks, you know, transcribe some of those notes into their own system and then return all the notebooks back. Um, so it's, it's just very manual. And so one of the things that we hope to bring in the hand have been bringing is a more technology bent on this world, those, that rote work. And so one of the key learnings for us was that like, you know, you could try to automate everything, but we're not going to send robots do care. Like that's just not gonna work. Um, and so what we can do is those have computers do as much as the sort of main, like the, uh, the rote tasks, the, um, matching algorithms, the gps tracking stuff.

Speaker 2:          14:39          And then let the humans do that. Really, really human stuff. And so we can get there about, you know, call 80% and then let the humans do the rest. And so one of the things that we've been trying to do is actually just give more transparency to the process, right? So if like I live in California, but my parents are in the east coast and I have someone I caregiver going every day, um, I can't go and find that spiral bound notebook and have someone read that to me every day. So we have given an APP, so they care pro, we've given an to the family, they can see notes right away, they can call on any time. I'm scheduling's a lot easier, um, the technology we use to then be able to track and give you progress notes on sort of how the visit is going his way.

Speaker 2:          15:17          But, you know, sort of amazing in this industry for a lot of folks. Um, and so just trying to up the quality and transparency of care itself, um, has been a huge goal for us. Um, and definitely the ability to use technology to scale. So because we have all this technology we might have, we might require one human to do this instead of 10. And so when you have that, you can save a lot of those, um, that time to go do other interesting innovative features to help with care delivery. So definitely a technology is definitely used to scale to pin, make better, better care, better quality of at the same time we have to recognize that it can't replace humans. And so at the end of the day, the human human experience is still the, the end product. You mentioned that you provide training for your care pro.

Speaker 2:          16:03          So what does that training and compass, it can vary, um, to sort of like basic skillsets. Like how do you lift and transfer, uh, uh, someone who has a, um, who's bedridden out of bed of bed into a chair. Um, how do you take someone from their bed to a toilet? Um, there are things like, okay, uh, what is the best way to, um, assist someone in this particular task? Um, and so we can also do things like, Oh, if you, if this person has Parkinson's, um, these are specific tools and techniques that you can use to help maneuver them physically. Um, if someone has dementia here, things here, techniques and sort of, um, generally accepted ways to communicate or to, uh, elicit, uh, feedback from, from those folks. And so a lot of it is sort of a skill wise, but also, um, how do you basically interact with different types of people?

Speaker 2:          16:59          Because a lot of our, our, uh, clients, uh, their conditions vary greatly. So, uh, it's not like one, one bucket fits all. And in terms of the composition of your audience, are you looking at mainly people who are soliciting care for their family members or actually seniors themselves who are asking for services for themselves? Yeah, it's both. We thought in the very beginning that we'd have more of what we call adult children. So it sort of someone, a child or a nephew or a sort of family member, then you're responsible for someone who's older. Um, but we also have folks who just want care for themselves. They recognize that they would want, well they want to stay at home, they don't want to go nursing home or facility. And so having a little bit additional help is actually really useful. Um, so yeah, it really, it just really varies, but we definitely have more folks who are getting care for themselves than we originally thought. So that again goes to debunk that myth that seniors don't really engage with

Speaker 1:          17:50          technology. Right. Cause I need to have some understanding in order to reach you. In some ways.

Speaker 2:          17:54          Yeah, they do have to sort of find us. But at the same time we don't require any technology to use honor. But that was a very conscious point. So like if you don't want to touch a computer, you don't want to use an APP, you don't have to. Oh you can. Like you can most of our customers call us. Oh, okay. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          18:10          So then you're also seeing how maybe you can leverage old technology using new technology for the platform, but for the interface relying on them.

Speaker 2:          18:20          Yeah. And so like those trends will change as well. So like our current demographic, a lot of folks just want to call it. And also you think about if you're, you know, an adult child and let's say your mom falls, which is very common, uh, entryway into home care. Um, you cove, you go from knowing nothing about home care to someone saying your mom needs like eight hours of care a day and you're like, oh my God. Like, what the Hell is home care? Um, and so you need to figure out like what's going on in your remote in a very emotional state. And so when you're a very emotional state, you're not going to like pick up your iPhone and be like, okay, I want care and click, click, click like you're gonna want to call somebody. Um, and so we have a dedicated team of people who answer those calls to make sure that people can walk the people through that process.

Speaker 2:          18:57          Um, and same time though, if you, you know, have gotten care for a while, you kind of know what home care is and all you want to do is sort of pressing buttons, you can do that as well. So there are different options. Um, and that'll probably change like, you know, I think when our one of our goals is to make honor, take care of us, what world, so, uh, obviously when we're older, the times maybe that no one wants to call it every once you use an iPhone or an android phone or whatever. Um, so we can kind of see the trends coming into the industry, um, which is, uh, a nice side effect of not working in some sort of more younger social media stuff because I don't know what the next 17 year old wants on her phone, but I do kind of know what the next 50 year old once. So, uh, that's been kind of an interesting change

Speaker 1:          19:37          in terms of scaling. So I see this in home, elderly care as being something that requires a lot of trust built over time and something that people really have to open themselves up to and be comfortable with. So how, as you're scaling, do you maintain that sense of trust and comfort?

Speaker 2:          19:54          Yeah. Um, I think the biggest thing you can do is also always frame your frame, your product. And your team in the right way. So when I said we don't think of ourselves as a tech company, but we think of ourselves as a services company, like that's the core, like that's the mission. Um, and so trust is huge because, um, unlike, I think a lot of people are like, oh, why don't you just do childcare to unlike childcare where there's usually a handoff where you're physically present, you give your child to a babysitter or nanny, and then at the end of the day, the nanny returns a child to you. Um, that doesn't always happen with senior care because you generally don't live with your parents at this age where you're across country or you're not, not in the same area. And so the trust part, um, you have to, uh, it's kind of both human and tech.

Speaker 2:          20:37          So on the human side you have to have a great care pro. Like if the person coming to your home is terrible, like obviously the trust is, goes down the toilet. So being really good hiring, um, really good care, you know, having the right kind of vetting process, the right kind of training process and interview process. Um, the other part is just sort of supplementing that with technology. So we have gps turned on for our here post. When they use the apps we can tell what they're there. Right. Um, that's also to protect the care pro cause we do have a lot of, some, some uh, instances where the client's like, oh no, the care pro never showed up because they didn't want to expose something to a family member. But they were like, well no, they were there. Um, and so it's a, it's a dual sided thing where you can't, if you just come with tech, it's too robotic, it's too cold. Um, the baby just come with humans. There are a lot of, you know, sort of, uh, non verifiable anecdotal things that were inefficiencies or deficiencies or he said she said things and so you can kind of couple those together and then have a better package to then improve on that or that trust. My truck

Speaker 1:          21:36          also related to scaling. So I saw that you guys are available in California, New Mexico and Texas right now. How did you pick which cities to go into first and then how do you think about a new city that you want? Yeah,

Speaker 2:          21:48          yeah. So, um, a fear of ours was actually just going too fast. Like you hear all these stories about other companies who have like really expanded and they had to retract and we don't want to do that. Uh, just because if you retract your service, this is, this is the thing that's like life critical for a lot of people. Um, and so every new market that we did, uh, currently was an experiment. So, um, La was a, you know, like an hour flight away. So can we do, can we do that? Um, Dallas, I mean, Texas was okay, it's a couple hour flight away. Like, can we do that a different time zone? Um, you know, for all the engineers are like, oh, time zone, that's sucks. So we had to kind of like figured out how to do that. Um, and then Albuquerque was a smaller area, like a less sort of dense urban read, uh, urban regions.

Speaker 2:          22:33          So we're like, okay, can we handle that? Um, and so, uh, we definitely wanted to learn and we can be, the best way to learn is by doing. And so we really carefully figured out what markets would give us the best learnings to then be able to take our model and scale out. So yes, eventually we'd love to be nationwide. Um, in terms of like the next market we'll go to again, we'll probably be a combination of, you know, are there good partnerships, what's the demographic look like? Services level, what can we learn from that particular market? Um, you know, things like that. So, yeah.

Speaker 1:          23:04          And you were at Google for about a year in 2012 maybe you could tell us if there's anything that you learned while at Google that has helped you with on it.

Speaker 2:          23:14          Um, I learned, I didn't want to be a Google, but, um, I did, uh, it was really interesting because I think from the outside, Google is this like big, amazing, monolithic collect technology company. Um, and so it was very interesting for me personally to learn how that worked. Like when you come in, it's like, okay, well how do they form the organization is how do they make product? How to make decisions. Um, you know, what are the roles that they hire for, how do they hire? And so for me, that was really enlightening because it gave me a, um, a different perspective on like how I did my, how I did my team building. Um, and so, uh, just being here like learning, okay, well this team operates this way and they set goals this way or they hire this way or they structure this team this way in order to, to create these, um, these incentives to get this goal done.

Speaker 2:          24:03          Um, that was really useful so that then I can incorporate that into honor and think about, okay, well, when I'm building the team, now how do I want it? How do I want to do it? Right? I can, I've learned this from Meebo, I learned this from Google and how can, how can I combine this the right way? And throughout these first few years, what do you see as something that your team has done really well at honor? Um, we execute a lot and crank out a lot of stuff. Um, I think one of the things that we did really well was, um, not rush the build. Um, and also having the realization that we needed to be completely open minded because none of us are from health care. Um, and so because the team stayed small and Nimble and we were very sort of focused, I think focus for startups is key.

Speaker 2:          24:50          Like most startups die from suicide and homicide. Um, and so for us we just had to stay laser focused. Okay. What are we building? Um, and because the team, some of us have worked together before and we were very picky about hiring, having really high bandwidth communication, um, really excels your timeline to be able to build something. So, you know, most home care agencies tap out at a certain scale, which is why the industry is very fragmented. Um, and so within, call it three years of our inception, we are probably one of the largest home care entities in the barrier, maybe the largest. Um, it took us three years to get there when it usually takes 15. So it kind of speaks to combination of like good teamwork, like the right technology, you know, sort of cutting edge stuff. Um, and then really understanding how to learn from things.

Speaker 2:          25:37          I think one of the downsides of the industry is that there are so many well intentioned people but they don't have the means and the technology to learn and iterate. And so getting data is really hard for them. Everything's, you know, in spiral bound notebooks and things like that. Um, and for us we can get a lot of data. Like we have so much data about how care works, how do you do matching, you know, what are the trends? Like what are we seeing in terms of shift lengths and days and areas and markets and pricing and waging what wages. And so all of that you can kind of use to learn and improve the service. When I think the current industry has a hard time accessing that. So, and as you were deciding whether to jump back into doing a startup or not, what were some factors that you were considering?

Speaker 2:          26:19          Um, that is just always very personal. Um, so obviously I was at the age where I wanted to have kids. Um, and so I was like, well if you really nice just to state Google cause they have like really good maternity leave and it's like really comfortable. Um, and you know, like I can have like a very routine schedule. Um, at the same time though, I think I had it had that, that need to, to do more. Um, I think Meebo he wouldn't, maybe it was great. I mean I had a great time, but it didn't have the impact that I think when we got older we really wanted, um, and uh, startups, average lifespan. And I say this law is about seven years to some sort of event or sort of pivot. Um, and so I was like, wow, I do, I really want to dedicate another seven years, um, and have kids while I do that.

Speaker 2:          27:06          And you know, all that stuff. Um, and so the allure of working with my cofounders again, um, it was just really good timing in terms of like the senior space. Um, no one had really made a big play in it before and we were like, we can really solve this. Um, I, I use this analogy a lot in my cofounder does as well, but a lot of problems that entrepreneurs run into that are big if you think about it like an onion is that you peel back one layer, you're like, oh, I can solve that. If people are going to delay your, like I could solve that. And then at some point you keep peeling, we hit this hardcore and you're like, crap, like I can't solve that. It's like a regulation or it would take like 10 years to build or I need to get like government approval and now it takes like six years or whatever.

Speaker 2:          27:48          Um, but in, in sort of the home care space, we kept peeling. We couldn't find anything that was super hard because we're like, oh, we could sell that because I thought we could sell that. And that was just really exciting. Um, and so jumping back in, we're like, all right, let's just, let's just do this because you basically have to commit 100% or zero, like you can't have half to do it. Um, and so, uh, we all kind of said, all right, let's just buckle up and do it. Um, have kids with all along the way. Um, and so, uh, this decision to do it was like actually quite easy one when we can just talk about that way. Um, and so far I've seen no have no regrets. So, oh yeah, that was comprehensive answer, I think

Speaker 3:          28:27          time to open it up for the audience. Questions. Hi Sandy. Um, I have a question about, um, I think what you're doing is fantastic. I think you have a great product and everything you're doing for the senior community. Um, a couple of years ago I went to the National Association for the Deaf Conference. It was in Atlanta and they also had one in Phoenix as well. And I met a lot of members from the deaf community who are aging, um, specific groups of seniors, helping people find a place to go. Do you have any involvement with the deaf community, uh, with your product or your services? Um, something that would be accessible for the deaf community?

Speaker 2:          29:03          So specifically, um, we don't have anything specifically targeted towards the death, but like I said before, our audience and the client demographic, it's very heterogeneous. We have people with all sorts of conditions. Um, and so we don't say, okay, just because you have this condition or that condition, we can't serve you. It's really dependent on the kind of care the person needs. And so let's say someone is deaf, they have a bad hip, uh, they require, uh, more lifting and transferring out of bed, then we would just try to find the right caregiver to then surface that person. So, um, we do have partnerships with more disease specific, um, uh, organization. So the pocket knife, National Parkinson's foundation, um, and uh, national, the, um, um, cancer organizations. But, uh, in the future, obviously we'd hope to partner with more people. But again, like we don't, there's no like specifically targeted service for death, but death to cause your death doesn't mean you can't help them care. So.

Speaker 1:          30:01          Okay. Here's a question from the dory. Uh, besides honor, what our key technological improvements that you believe have improved elderly care? What other technological improvements would you like to see in the space to improve the experience for both the caretaker and the elderly?

Speaker 2:          30:17          Yeah, I think the biggest thing is probably just access. Um, there are a lot of devices and market, a lot of technologies that are, uh, like I said, really like specifically targeted for seniors, but they're taking a very, um, non granular stance. So like I said, the bigger buttons, the big fonts and the senior, like, have you talked to a lot of older adults? They don't like things dumbed down for them. Like they're like, I'm, I'm perfectly capable of using it regular device. Um, so I think there needs to be a change in the attitude, I think more than the actual devices. Um, because if you sort of rethink the way you frame technology, you can like I know plenty of seniors who use iPhones and android phones and a very expert manner. Um, and there are some folks who don't. Um, and so there I think the, if you change the way that you target seniors, I think that would be a big difference.

Speaker 2:          31:10          Um, things that I think it had been really helpful for folks are, um, you know, more, um, more educational tools for folks who help seniors is probably a good step. So the fact that we have an APP for care pros is actually like a novel thing for the industry. Um, but it makes them better enabled to help people who require help. Um, I would say the, um, one thing that is a, a lot of the, um, the physical access things that you and I take for granted, like walking upstairs, going through her door, Romania, lot code, those kinds of things could probably be improved as the senior population increased it, uh, it gets larger. Um, so basically I think that my, my biggest thing is not specifics, but more of the attitude change I think is probably more important than the actual, like physical things are being built.

Speaker 1:          32:06          And related to that, have you thought about maybe expanding your sphere of care into sort of providing support services for the family members who are maybe like learning about working or, uh, supporting their family members who are becoming elderly and maybe developing additional needs that they didn't have before?

Speaker 2:          32:24          Yeah, so home care, generally speaking, people don't think about it until they really need it. So it don't care is usually triggered by an acute event, usually a fall or a met like a, um, a surgery or something medical. Um, if we had the a lot earlier, we could actually then introduce care and a more lightweight manner. So then that way the transition into home care is less jarring. Um, in terms of family members, we do have a lot of family members who get home care for their spouses or their parents, um, as respite care. So they are the primary caretaker and they live with the, with with the person Riverton, uh, receiving care. But they might need a day off or they might need three days off every week cause it's kind of a full time job. And so the sub supplement with with honor, we're home care to help with that.

Speaker 2:          33:11          Um, and I think the other, um, part of it is that, uh, a lot of people who are in this situation feel very alone. Um, there aren't like social networks for people who are giving, who are receiving home care for their family members and no one talks about this like on Facebook or whatever. Right? It's not like you're saying, oh my mom got here today. Like no one talks about it. So, uh, opening up the conversation, having more community around that. It's one of our goals as well. Um, and also just the transparency. It's like having the peace of mind to get home care. Cause it's scary. It's like you're letting a stranger into your home and take care of your, your mom or dad doing very intimate things like going to the bathroom or getting out of bed. Um, and so the support network I think needs to be there.

Speaker 2:          33:52          Um, cause almost everybody we talked to, um, has a personal story but they don't never share it because it's just, it's come up. It's a very taboo subject. So I'm hoping it opening to hoping to open up that that dialogue is one of the things that we're trying to do, which is why I think we we frame honor and a very positive light. A lot of um, agencies were senior related products on TV you see or like the help I've fallen, I can't get up or it's like very like fear based. Um, we chose amber as a very bright color, very positive color. Um, we talked about it a very positive manner. We have positive images, not images that sort of instill fear or um, you know, sort of the, the more scary side of that.

Speaker 1:          34:36          How do you reach new clients and convey valleys of trust and safety in non tech cities where people have not heard of honor and may rely on word of mouth or local searches?

Speaker 2:          34:45          Yeah. So healthcare traditionally is a very local, so word of mouth is extremely powerful. Um, and you can't just, when home care market share by like advertising on, on Google or Facebook because that's not how you reach people. Um, and like I said, a lot of times home care is triggered by an acute event and so you're not paying attention anything in home care or in the elderly space where the health care space until something happens. And then, you know, our job is to be there when that happens. So I'm addressing the part where someone who's not very tech savvy or they don't really know much about honor. Um, the one thing that we have to portray is that we are human. And so, um, prior to any home care, um, set of visits, we send a fee like a person I cared one of our care advisors to your home to do a consultation.

Speaker 2:          35:31          Like they talk you through the plan and they talk you through what your needs are. They listen to what you need. Cause a lot of times just don't, don't know. It's like, okay, my mom fell. What do I do? Okay, you need someone to actually like walk you through that process. And so, um, basically instilling trust via a person is still a great way to do it. Um, and so that's something that we do definitely employ. Um, and then also just being a knowledge expert. So again, when you're like emotional and you're scared and you don't know what you're doing, you want someone to tell you it's okay. I've done this before, I've seen this before. Like, let me listen to you, I can help you through this process. Um, and so that's a very, very, um, serious thing that we take very seriously to make sure that when people come into honor, when people think about home care, um, they think about honor and as a very calming expert voice, um, it's something we strive, we strive to sort of propagate.

Speaker 2:          36:21          You mentioned that a lot of the seniors that solicit care for themselves reach out to you via phone. So how do they find you? Do you also advertise then in traditional media as well? The yellow pages, all those? Yeah, so it's been a bit of a challenge to find out where those, where those things are. Um, the, a lot of times, um, like I said, weren't math is most powerful. So reaching the influencers within the community. So like a local pastor, uh, local, um, senior organization, um, the, the, um, the, you know, discharge nurse at a facility, it happens near all the community members. Um, you know, the mayor, whoever like is sort of an community influencer. So that's one way to do it. The other way is just basically to provide care and then have referrals. So if someone has a great experience with us, they will tell their friends.

Speaker 2:          37:10          Um, because generally speaking, if you were getting care, you probably know the people were getting care. Um, and then, you know, obviously you try to sort of, um, advertise and sort of the normal channels, but those are all but less effective. Just because it can be generally not in your frame of mind when you need to. Um, and then the other part is to partner with other people who deal with seniors. So we opened up a partner network to work with existing home care agencies. Um, we work with, um, system, so hospitals and facilities, um, nursing facilities, discharge facilities to help spread the word so that they know that honors and option. Um, and that, you know, we're differentiated from the rest of the other agencies around because we have all these sort of benefits so that even these traditional organizations are willing to work with you.

Speaker 2:          37:55          They're not scared of that and somehow you're going to take over. We're encompass some of what they're doing and take this this week. Yeah. So, um, it's been interesting with that particular, um, um, partnership network. Um, like I said, a lot of current home healthcare agencies have a hard time growing cause they're like, I have do people, it's all in my head. I don't have technology. I, it's like really hard for me to, to like wrangle a care pros and higher care pros and match care pros. Um, I get calls at 2:00 AM when a care pro can't make it and I have to go and like do the care of myself. Um, and so they have to deal with all that and they don't tend to grow a lot. So, um, one of our benefits is that we're really good at the care pro part. Like a really good recruiting part. We have technology to help us do all that stuff and so, and we can take that burden away from them. They can actually grow. And so it's actually a really good partnership where we both sort of benefit from that. Um, and we're both, if both people often st mission, like we're trying to help people. Um, but you know, they're good at one part, we're going another part. And so if you put it together, it's actually really good.

Speaker 1:          38:51          Yeah. So I think this is actually really cool to see because I think so much of like the newer like service based economy, like you look at maybe like Uber or these other startups, um, people see them as supplanting an existing industry and there's a lot of pushback and conflict between the traditional industry and the new tech company. Um, whereas here I think it's sort of you're trying to work together and make it more of a mutual relationship.

Speaker 2:          39:17          Yeah, definitely. It's, it, there initially people were a little bit skeptical that it'll be like, wait, what? Like here if I'm just like, wait, what are you guys doing? Um, but when you kind of explain sort of like, you know, how we work, why are we doing this? Like why are were mission focus, things like that. Then they start to be like, oh wow. Like if I really partner with you, we can really make a better difference, a bigger difference and help more people. Um, because a lot of these people who come into the an inch into the industry are genuinely there just help people. Like, they could make more money doing other things, but they really like the work because they get to interact with clients and talk to people and help them through these things. Um, and so when they find a willing partner like honor who has all these skills and tech can like teams that they don't have, it's actually a pretty exciting. So, um, it's a new way to innovate on an existing model, I think, um, that were like both sides are pretty excited about it. So,

Speaker 1:          40:07          uh, another question from the Dory. What are some key technology or product decisions that had to be made to ensure that honor is friendly both to the elderly users and also to the family members who are on different panes of technology? Familiarity.

Speaker 2:          40:24          Yeah. So, uh, like I said before, we don't require anybody to know anything about apps or phones or websites to use honor. So they could completely do everything by phone if they want to do. Um, because we know that's a huge part of our audience. Uh, at the same time though, we do want to push the envelope a little bit and like sort of give folks the option is using technology to see the benefits of it. So, um, all the technology is optional for the, the care team of a particular, um, uh, a care recipient. So if the family member chooses to use the family hub, they can, they don't want to, they don't have to, um, they want to log into the website and see all their bills and see the care notes sentence. You get emails they can, but if they don't want to, they don't have to.

Speaker 2:          41:05          So we are trying to be very respectful of the way the current industry works and how some people just don't want to touch. It's too complicated to touch tech. Um, same time though, if there are folks who really want to like stick take that leap, um, we're there with them as well. Um, the one thing we do require our care pros do is care pros have is the APP. Um, and they actually love it. So we do push the technology on the workforce, um, but definitely makes them more effective, more, um, aware of what's going on. Um, better enable them to find more jobs by more work or more money. So that's sort of our, our balance. But yeah, if you don't know anything about tech, you can just use a rotary phone and call us every day if you want to do

Speaker 1:          41:46          elderly care by nonfamily members is common in the u s but in some other countries like the Ukraine, it is not culturally accepted, but there is a huge market for it. I wonder your thoughts on how to help make a service like honor be acceptable in such a culture.

Speaker 2:          42:01          Yeah. Um, we've, we've actually been, uh, people have reached out to us from different, uh, sort of care organizations from different countries. I'm wondering, we're going to expand to their country. Obviously we'd love to do that one day, but obviously not right now. Um, culturally you have to respect the way that care works. But I think the trend of more and more people moving to more urban areas, um, more more people moving out of their city that they're born in, um, tends to sort of consolidate a lot of the same types of concerns around senior care. So, you know, um, if you don't live in the same place as your parents moving your parents to where you are, it can be rather expensive, right? If you live in a more urban area, it's just real estate. It's tighter. Houses are smaller, um, transportation harder, especially in accessibility.

Speaker 2:          42:51          So if someone has, you know, a 90 year old mother who can't do stairs very well, but you live on the sixth floor of an apartment, that's a really difficult thing to have to deal with. And so a lot of the, even though culturally people may have different expectations, I think a lot of the trends are moving towards the same direction. And so I think in the future we have to just find that balance of obviously respecting the current, the current tradition, but also pushing folks to understand the reality of what's happening. Um, and then, you know, kind of just to see, you know, maybe all the caregivers in the particular country are very different from the ones in the u s maybe they're doing it, they're, maybe they're not. Um, if we can introduce, introduce, um, a way of doing things, maybe that, you know, spurs a new kind of trend or movement, but, um, any of the day, I think generally speaking, a lot of countries are kind of migrating towards the same problems.

Speaker 1:          43:45          Words matter in the space that you're working in right now. How does your messaging change between the patient versus the family member or caregiver to communicate your value proposition? What has resonated the most and the least? Who's, who's usually making the purchase decision?

Speaker 2:          44:02          So generally speaking, it's usually the adult child that's making the purchase decision. Um, uh, and so, um, it's an interesting conversation. So the most effective communicator is usually the family member to the, um, senior. Um, but sometimes it's not. So we do have, um, care Syrians who are resistant to care. So they like, they don't want someone in their home, they don't want to carry it, that they need it. Um, and sometimes they would rather talk to us then their family member because they don't want to expose some their needs to the family member because what happens is it when you expose that you are exposing a lack of control and that's really scary. And so a lot of times we'll have this like interesting dynamic where they don't want it like a person person getting care doesn't want to tell the family member all that happened. But they're willing to tell the care pro because you care if I was helping. So again, it's all dependent on the sort of situation. Um, for the most part we do do a lot of communication through the um, family member who's, who was the one responsible for the care or the Dillinger relationship. Um, but a lot of times when the Care Sabine is the actual account owner, then we directly communicate with them.

Speaker 1:          45:10          Can you tell us about how you train your care pros? Is it in person training or mostly online?

Speaker 2:          45:16          So most of it right now is in person. Um, it's usually most effective cause a lot of it's sort of like physical stuff that we're teaching. Um, we loved, we are hoping to expand to more online things. But um, for now a lot of it is physical in the office, on the job. Um, and also through, um, through the APP or like sort of phone or text communication. We do, we've talked to our care. It was a lot so that they're in constant communication with us telling us what they need to do.

Speaker 1:          45:41          And then how many families are you currently helping?

Speaker 2:          45:45          So that's not a number we'd generally expose. Um, but we just, we are, our sort of canned answer to that is that we serve the entire bay area, La, Dallas, fort worth and Albuquerque when we start New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico. So it kind of gives you a general idea of sort of the market sizes, but we don't actually suppose the actual number. So,

Speaker 1:          46:03          and then related to the idea of expanding potentially to areas where it's not culturally, um, common for non family members to take care of the elderly. How do you think about not just expanding into those areas but maybe like creating materials to help people in those areas who maybe don't necessarily interface with your business directly, but maybe you just provide resources?

Speaker 2:          46:31          Yeah, so that was, uh, that goes back to the point where just being a knowledge expert is actually really helpful. And so I'm not just having an online presence, but you know, going and getting into the communities, it's actually a really, really positive thing. So when you go to a senior center or you go to like a local event, um, you can just be there and then be a trusted, like they'd be a familiar face. So then when people have questions, they're like, oh, you should talk to this person. They kind of have an, I have a better idea of how, like, how, you know, the elderly space works. Then you start to sort of like in bed yourself better. And so, um, part of the, the um, way to, um, get better word of mouth is just sort of taking advantage of the fact that health care and home care is very local.

Speaker 2:          47:13          And so you have to respect that. You can't just be like, I'm this giant national entity. I'm just going to go and spread ads everywhere. Like that doesn't work. Like you have to really go in and um, participate and talk to people and actually like be in the community to really make a dent. So that's generally the tack that will probably, so what's the pricing structure look like in this industry and where do you find and where does honor place itself? Yeah, so pricing generally is by um, shift length. So it's like an hourly early because the care pros get paid hourly. Um, we're kind of like right smack in the middle with most of the industry in terms of our pricing. Um, certain areas are a little harder to serve. So, for example, if you are a care pro making minimum wage or a little bit above, you know, a $6 bridge toll from the East Bay to the peninsula is a lot of money for you.

Speaker 2:          48:03          And so it's much harder for you to get from East Bay to let's say Palo Alto and so in certain harder to reach areas. So Palo Alto, you know, as parts of San Francisco prices can be a little higher because we have to be able to pay the care pro more. Um, that's generally more of a common trend with, with uh, home care. But generally speaking, we're kind of like very much market prices. Um, and our hope is that because we can take a lot of the manual work out of the process, um, we can, you know, maybe at some point charge a little less, pay a little more and it'll take that, those gains because we have a little more efficiency within our system since we are using the employee model. Does that mean that care pros have to work a certain number of hours or certain shifts during, um, within with W2's?

Speaker 2:          48:48          Uh, you don't have to like enforce a certain hour. We have some folks who use us who work with us on more of a part time basis or they just pick up shifts in the evening or on the weekends because they have another job. Um, we have other folks who use us as their primary Gig and so we are their primary employer and they take most of the work from us. It's very fuck. Like it's, it's more flexible and I think then people kind of think about when think about employee model, but um, like we do realize that care pros have a lot of restrictions in terms of what they can and can't do. You know, folks at Google generally don't have, when you have trouble with your car it's like, oh, it's really annoying. But when your car is the only thing that is really providing your work, uh, conduit, um, it's, it's a lot harder.

Speaker 2:          49:32          And so we just to make sure that we're respectful of that and we provide enough sort of options of types of work for our care pros. And I'm wrapping up. I have one question about any specific technology or product that you're excited about in the near future? I would say the just for more than one. Yeah, I guess I just related to honor, um, there's much more intention now to seniors. I think that's awesome. Um, before honor, there was like no funding in the senior space. Um, and now we have, um, you know, companies like really, really focusing on how to cater to seniors. Um, and not just like building devices or technology, but sort of really thinking about it from a offerings perspective. Cause just cause the baby boomers and senior population is just going to explode in the next 10 years or 10 to two, 10 to 20 years. So I would say like, and then maybe nothing specific, but anything really, like anybody really investing in a, uh, not just seniors, but demographics of audiences that are not traditionally invested in, I think is awesome.
