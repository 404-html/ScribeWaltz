Speaker 1:          00:00:08       Thanks for joining us at this talks at Google event to everyone here and on the live stream and watching the video recording. We're lucky to be joined today by Jordan Harbinger. I missed the cue means a lot means a lot. So Jordan and he's the host of the successful podcast, the art of charm, which focuses on psychology, performance, life and success. And he's brought up a wide range of people onto the show from celebrities to subject matter experts in the sciences and the arts. He recently had Neil degrasse Tyson on, which was pretty awesome episode, I might say. Definitely check that one out. And he's going to be talking to us today about building relationships and social capital. So some very interesting stuff. And if we have time we might hear a little bit about a story of how he was kidnapped in Serbia. So we'll just leave that, leave that to be expanded further. So without further ado, here's Jordan.

Speaker 2:          00:01:06       Thank you very much. Got The second round. Everybody was like on point with the applause. I appreciate that a lot. It's great to be speaking here at Google. It's great to be speaking in front of a room of people at all because a few short years ago I was extremely shy and shy isn't actually, she's not even the word for it actually at all. It was more like crippling anxiety, especially as a kid. I hated being in school. I hated being around other people. I don't know, something like they're all looking at me. I'm sure one or two of you in the audience have seen or felt like that at some point in your life, especially when you're younger. And so I started skipping school a lot and it went a little something like this, get up, get dressed, get on the bus, go to school and then immediately show up for maybe one class or try to show up for a few classes or just turn around and walk home.

Speaker 2:          00:02:00       And it wasn't the cool kind of skipping school where you're going to fancy restaurants and dancing on parade floats like Ferris Bueller, but the kind of skipping school where your parents come home at 4:00 PM or 5:00 PM and finding playing video games in your underwear. So that system, the education thing, the formal education thing really wasn't working for me at all. And I started to get my act together a little bit when I was older in high school slash college and I graduated from the University of Michigan Undergrad and my friends all had bright futures ahead of them. They were going to work at AOL, which was a big deal at that point in time and they were right heard of that and other people were working in finance and things like that and buying their newly back in fashion, acid wash jeans and heading off to New York.

Speaker 2:          00:02:46       And I wasn't really sure what I wanted to do. I needed a little bit more time to figure it out. I'm sure we've all heard that phrase or use that phrase before as well. And so one day I got a bright and early because I needed a new disc man. The one with anti-skid because when your roller blading, that's what you need. Otherwise it bumps around all over the place. And I think I just ripped space time with that 98 reference there. But you need to have the mega base, you need to have the anti skip. And frankly I eat at 2:00 PM was about the time I rolled in because it was college. So Brighton early is a relative term, but I started talking with the guy that worked at best buy and he said, you know a lot about this stuff. You know, what are you doing after college?

Speaker 2:          00:03:23       And I thought, well you're looking at it man, this is what I'm doing right now and maybe I should work here for the summer. I know how to fix computers and how to build computers. I can install software, remove software. This is the late nineties or early two thousands at this point I think. And this is a perfect job for me, right? I can easily fall into into this field. And he said, soy, your role man, you know you have to work selling music, cds and things like that. The remnants of the cassette section at best buy before you can move up to computer repair and customer service. So all my friends with their bright futures, I saw my bright future go down the toilet in front of a life size cutouts of Brittany Spears, so that system wasn't working for me, still not working for me and I did what a lot of guys do.

Speaker 2:          00:04:11       A lot of people do when they run out of career options entirely and they're backed against the wall and they feel like they have no future and I became a lawyer and so of course I'm stuck in law school thinking, okay this just bought me three more years. Good plan. Everybody says you can get a great job once you get out of law school. This is for sure going to be a winning strategy for me and I really felt out of place most of the time if not the entire time I felt out of place the vast majority of the time and that's called imposter syndrome and pretty much everybody has this. I don't know how you felt when you got hired here at Google and everywhere that I go speak, there's always some measure of people and we won't even do a show of hands because it's so predictable every single time.

Speaker 2:          00:04:52       There's always some measure of people, the majority in fact, who think that they're the group or the person that slipped through the cracks and that at some point they're going to get found out that they don't really know what they're doing or they're not really as talented as is everybody else in the room and it's only a matter of time until they get found out and possibly or likely fired. And that is what I had in my head when I started working on Wall Street. Now the guy who hired me, his name was Dave and Dave was cool and no lawyers were cruel really. And that's kind of a general rule, but especially at this particular firm, there weren't a whole lot of guys that were doing finance that were really well respected by everybody. And everybody thought Dave was just the man and he was a guy from Brooklyn.

Speaker 2:          00:05:33       Andy had a 10 so obviously he knew something that other people did not know. When you're from Brooklyn, you have a 10 take notes, right? Everybody tends to take notes on that and this guy was never in the office ever. And if there's something that you might know about lawyers, it's that they bill in six minute increments generally, and this is what they're doing when they're in every phase of their, their workday, they're billing in these little increments of time. So they stay in the office all day, oftentimes all night, and everybody was working all the time, especially on Wall Street in 2007 2008 one time I went up to my office on a Saturday night, probably maybe even a Friday night to show it off to my friends. This is probably my first month on the job and I thought, I'm going to go up in this big Manhattan skyscraper, open up a bottle of whiskey.

Speaker 2:          00:06:18       We're going to hang out in my office and talk about how we all finally made it to New York and we're doing really well. And when I opened the elevator door on the 42nd floor of world financial number two, the place looked like Monday morning. Everybody was in there. I'm talking everybody except for our summer class, which is what I was in. All the partners were there. All of the associates, junior and senior were there. There were closing some deal and it was kind of a normal situation. I didn't know that at the time. I actually went back in the elevator, push the ground floor button and get the hell out of there. Obviously as fast as I could before they gave me some paperwork or some documents to review because I wanted to continue my life and my evening and my weekend. But what ended up being really frightening was when I went back to work on Monday morning, I asked the senior associate, what's the deal?

Speaker 2:          00:07:01       Why are there so many people in the office on a weekend? You know, are we closing a big deal or is there, are we short staffed? What's the problem? And he said, no man, we're always here at this time. There's not a weekend that goes by that we're not here. 10:00 PM 11:00 PM one two in the morning if there's any work to be had, we're doing it. I mean we bill in six minute increments. There's one guy that wasn't there besides me. Of course Dave was not there. Dave was nowhere to be found. Dave wasn't there at 2:00 AM on a Saturday and he certainly wasn't there at 2:00 PM on a Tuesday. And this was so confusing to me and luckily Dave was assigned by HR to be my mentor and not right. Not the kind of mentor. It's like, oh, we're on the top floor, do an oyster shooters with Matthew mcconaughey, like on Wolf of Wall Street.

Speaker 2:          00:07:48       Not that kind of mentor. This is the kind of mentor where HR is like, you have to hang out with this guy twice. Check the boxes when you do so that we know you mentor this person during the summer. And uh, he was thrilled about it. As you might imagine. Everybody else that was on this mentorship program that was in the law firm was going to see blue man group to put a little bit of a timestamp on it too, to go out for drinks and have $190 seafood lunches. And my mentor was being forced at this point now that I ratted him out. Pro Tip, never do that to HR. He was being forced to take me out for coffee in essentially the basement of our building and mentor me by force. And what that entailed was him banging away on his blackberry with a full keyboard and black and white screen and probably playing Brickbreaker, which is still one of the best games of all time on any mobile platform.

Speaker 2:          00:08:41       He asked me or told me rather to ask him anything. And at this point I didn't have a whole lot of questions lined up. Right. I just figured mentorship was kind of unidirectional. I didn't know that I had to play a part in this other than showing up, which you know, shows my, my understanding of Wall Street at that time. But he didn't have a clue either. So the first question that I asked them was something that I was pretty sure it was going to get me fired, but I didn't care at this point because again, I thought it's only a matter of time until they find me out anyway. I might as well get this one off my chest. And I said, how come everyone is always in the office? Always billing hours, always billing in six minute increments, but you're never here. What are you doing all day?

Speaker 2:          00:09:22       What do you do at our law firm? And he put down his blackberry and he leaned in and he said, who's talking about what I do all day? And at this point I'm just like, this is how you get fired at Starbucks for sure in front of all these people. I'm going to get reamed out by a partner and walk home and just, I'm gonna leave my phone there. I'm not even to go back and get it. This is it. This is the end. It's going to be the most embarrassing time in my life. And of course I backtracked like crazy and I said, well, you know, some people here, maybe I've mentioned that you're just not around a lot. I don't know. You know, I'm busy working so I didn't even notice. But he goes, well look, let me be honest with you man.

Speaker 2:          00:09:59       I bring in all of the deals for our real estate department. I go out and I meet potential clients, which at that point were investment bankers and I do things with them that create relationships and then they give us business. That's why we have a new million dollar deals every couple months or every quarter here at the firm. And I was super confused by this because it didn't occur to me that going out and getting relationships with people would somehow bring benefit. I thought people found law firms in the yellow pages and hired them and that was it. Or maybe they were really good at something. And so people noticed and they hired them because of that reason. And that turns out to be only part of the equation. So what Dave was actually doing was lead Gen, business development, networking, relationship development, whatever you want to call it, but it was very informal.

Speaker 2:          00:10:45       The reason he had a tan was because he was always outside golfing or running or cycling with these bankers. He did Jujitsu, which made him walk with a limp. By the way, I don't know why people still do that. Everybody I know who does Jujitsu is injured, but he would go on charity cruises. He would go out to lunch with people all the time. He would go on charity dinners. He was always gone for the weekend at someone's house in the Hamptons and at that time being 26 27 years old, that sounded amazing. Not just because it sounded relatively easier than checking for Commas and 800 page documents, which is what I was doing most of the time, but because I actually had some inkling that I would never get better at the lawyer side of things. I couldn't make myself smarter and my competitive advantages have evaporated because when I was a kid, I got by a little bit on general smarts.

Speaker 2:          00:11:35       I'm sure y'all are familiar with that. You go to school and you just kind of show up and it's not that hard, right. All the way through high school. But then you get to college and even if everyone's as smart as you, 90% of the people there are drinking their face off every single day and you just kind of have to focus in even a minor way to outdo those folks and now work them. And that worked in law school as well. But by the time you get to Wall Street, everybody's willing to work and everybody is smart. And I was sure as heck convinced that they were smarter than me. And that became a huge problem because any competitive advantage that I had been leaning on for my entire life had essentially evaporated. The moment I walked in the door of that term and I started at the bottom of the totem pole with no plan on how to work my way up.

Speaker 2:          00:12:17       And so the way that the things that Dave was talking about, this networking, this relationship development, this changed the way that I look at work forever. Because if he can learn this skillset or if he can have this and I can maybe figure out how to do part of that stuff, if I can figure out some ways in which I can increase my skills in that area, by the time all these really smart people that I'm working with me on the same level, figure out they even need to do this. I'll already have a four or five, six year advantage. I'll have a long leg up in this race. This is kind of a tortoise and the hare type thing, right? So if I start now, maybe if I stick around long enough and don't get fired before then I'll actually have a fighting chance at making partner.

Speaker 2:          00:12:56       That's my plan to get to the top of the long game. You know how that turned out, so I want to, I don't need to explain that one, but this is just such a massive, massive realization for me and it really, really changed the way that I started to think about relationships and then I started to think about my work there. It was sort of a secret third path to get to the top that nobody else was aware of. Now, Dave was not the most skilled lawyer. He was not the smartest lawyer. He was just the best connected lawyer. And that sounds a little bit troubling because obviously you want people who are competent to be on the top. It wasn't that he was incompetent and I just want to make that really clear. He was, it wasn't just that he got by on charm, it wasn't just that he got by in relationships.

Speaker 2:          00:13:36       He worked his way towards the top, but his relationships are what pulled him and propelled him, I should say, over the top, early in the game and kept him up there because as somebody with very rare people, skills and sales skills essentially for client development, networking, whatever you want to call it, those skills are so rare in technical professions like being a lawyer, doctor, dentist, Google perhaps that they're actually so rare that they demand higher compensation and they, they get you into doors that would otherwise maybe be close to you at least for a few more years. And since they were so rare, they made him so valuable to the firm. And this was a guy bear in mind who when he hired me, I saw him when they forced him to mentor me, I saw him. And the third time that I saw him, he was in the elevator for an all hands meeting with the managing partner, essentially the CEO of the firm and he jokes, is there some kind of emergency meeting going on?

Speaker 2:          00:14:29       What are you doing here? So it became almost a meme, a joke inside the firm that Dave was showing up at any given time because it was so rare. It was an event that everybody started talking about an actually made jokes about. So this is how we calculated his hourly value, right? We looked at his time spent in the firm. Every six minute increment was worth a certain amount of with him billing out at about 800 bucks an hour. If he brings in a million dollar law deal and he spends 40 102 hundred hours working on that particular deal, every single deal that he gets his worth, I won't do the math for you because I that's not, that's why I became a lawyer first of all. So they don't have a lot of math. It's a hell of a lot more than 800 bucks an hour and those deals stack onto each other because you get deals from the same people.

Speaker 2:          00:15:17       So his time was worth more than any other partner in the firm, probably worth more than most of the other partner's time combined in the firm. So he was able to write his own ticket and that's why when I realize that you needed to work outside the system in order to succeed inside the system, I started to get my notepad out and take notes because I figured if I can master this skill set, then the sky's the limit in the professional spheres, in any technical profession, in any professional whatsoever that I've ever encountered. The strength of your relationships translates directly to opportunity, prosperity and flexibility. And this is, these are all separate, but they're all equally important in many, many ways. And that has to do with what you end up doing now, five years from now, 10 years from now, how you're compensated for doing that and where you're doing that.

Speaker 2:          00:16:08       And it's a safe bet that a handful of people in this room like networking. I definitely don't even like the word networking. I think it's kind of got a dirty kind of crusty feel to it these days because it's smarmy, right? You think throwing business cards in someone's face and being like, call me when you need a financial manager and that nobody likes those people. So it makes you feel dirty thinking, I don't want to do this. I don't if, if I don't have to be that guy and I just keep my head down and work, you know, I'll get to the top of this. And to a certain extent that may be true, but the rest of us, we hate networking for that reason and that actually harms us because that's not the only way to get relationships built. It's not the only way to build relationships with other people and keep them and maintain them and grow them over time.

Speaker 2:          00:16:51       And that's why there's that fundamental difference that we have in our heads of what networking is, how it works and how we might learn it or not learn it depending on how angsty we get around that particular term. At the art of charm, we teach people how to leverage opportunity, leverage relationships, get deals that competitors can only dream about due to those relationships and turn something that most of us dread secretly or not so secretly into one of our strongest competitive advantages. And no surprise, the old trope, it's all about who you know, not what you know that that gets thrown around a lot. But when people say that there's usually a little bit of stank on the end, right? It's not like, oh, it's all about who you know. It's usually like, oh, it's all about who you know. And we throw that out there when somebody gets promoted over us or when we lose a deal or when we don't get on the project that we want to get on or when we lose a job or worse, lose a relationship or a partner because of somebody else's relationship or their skills inside those relationships and even inside companies like Google, the most brilliant idea that you have can fail if you don't have the right people around you.

Speaker 2:          00:17:57       If you don't have the right team around you, and I hope none of you have experienced that firsthand, something tells me that most all of you have at this point in your career experience, something like that. That might even be why you're here and when I was young, when I was in college and to a certain extent in law school, I thought that networking relationships, networks in general were things that you were born into. Your family had them. You went to a fancy private school where you wear a blue blazer with a little insignia on it and you hung out and played croquet or polo or something all day, and everyone on everybody went on to do something amazing. And then you could call those, those guys and gals together@theendofthedayandfigureoutworlddominationdot.dot, profit, right? That's how I imagine this would work. And sometimes people marry into it, which by the way, if you can do that, highly recommended, uh, for the rest of us, we kind of have to figure out how to generate these relationships on our own.

Speaker 2:          00:18:52       And if your parents didn't do this for you, you have to do this. If you want to reap the benefits yourself and if you want your kids to reap the benefits of relationships and networks that you've grown over the course of your life because these things don't happen necessarily by themselves. The good news is that with intentional application of these topics, you can actually surpass people that were born into a good network because they are coasting, they're coasting on their previous momentum and we have our foot on the gas if we're intentional about it. Again, the tortoise and the hare networking and relationship development is a way of being. It is a set of habits. This isn't something that turns on and off over time. It's something that's always on but not in that always on used car salesman kind of way. Something that you do that you systemize and I think I'm in the right place to talk about systems.

Speaker 2:          00:19:41       I hope something that you systemize and have it work for you. I moved to San Francisco from la about three or four years ago now and after a year or two in San Francisco, a lot of my friends who had grown up there or he'd been there for a decade and change would remark things like, how do you know so many people? How are you getting invited to so many things? How can we have all these different relationships? I don't really understand it. I work from home. Actually. I don't know if y'all know that I work from my house. I see no one except for my wife all day long. I hang out with my cats more than most people. How are these relationships being developed? It doesn't make any sense from the outside, but once you see the matrix and see how these things work, there's really no going back because you can start to systemize.

Speaker 2:          00:20:27       Everyone has the capacity to do this. It's another important key. A lot of people, how many people think they're introverts are kind of self proclaimed introverts at some level. All right, cool. I was like, oh no one's raising their hand, but couldn't. Classic introvert fashion. Everyone waited for someone else to do at first. Good. I'm in good company. I am also technically speaking an introvert and that's fine, but what it's important for us to realize is that we don't have a medical excuse to not build relationships anymore. Introversion is one of those things. It's like, well, I would go and develop relationships. I would go to this event, but I'm an introvert so I'm off the hook and then you go back to whatever you like to do, which is me time. If you're anything like me and I understand that, but we can't lean on that anymore. All of all that introversion means is we prefer to not socialize with other people or we prefer to recharge by focusing on ourselves. It has nothing to do with our ability to learn these skills. And in fact new research now shows that introverts in large part are more introspective and are better at reading other people's behavior, which coincidentally is great for building and maintaining relationships.

Speaker 2:          00:21:39       So your homegrown network keeps opportunity flowing into your life at an unstoppable pace. And that's true whether you're inside a company, whether you're an entrepreneur, whether you've got a good side hustle going. And by the way, it's pure job security inside an organization. Dave, by the way, left are sinking law firm cause we were heavily leveraged in 2008 with the real estate thing. I was in the real estate department by the way. Not a good bet. He walked out of that sinking ship and walked right into a partner level job at another firm. And I know this because I saw him in the elevator while I was working at Sirius XM satellite radio doing the art of charm. And he said, don't I know you from somewhere? And the answer was no, I don't think so. Uh, he walked right in. Everybody else was punished by the reception, a recession.

Speaker 2:          00:22:24       My other partners, my other bosses there, they're retired now. Some of them were in their forties I don't think they had planned to do that after slaving for a decade, decade and a half to make partner on Wall Street. And some of them are still unraveling that mess from a decade ago. The recession was a decade ago. There's still retired. This is not good. And it's not that they didn't do the right thing. They build so many hours. They worked so hard for their job, their from their clients, but they just didn't have the book of business to save their bacon at the end of the day. And the hitch here really is that even if we were, you collectively decide to willfully ignore this particular skillset, you're just being willfully ignorant of the secret game being played around you and you're not immune to the consequences. I'm sure plenty of the other partners in that firm thought, you know, look at Dave's the guy who goes out and get the business.

Speaker 2:          00:23:13       There's always going to be room for me here. We always need workhorses. And that's just not necessarily true. You have to diversify your skillset and if you're going to skill stack and have multiple skills that you are good at, one of them better be relationship development. So I like to give homework and I know how much everyone here loves homework, but in the next month, and if you're taking notes is a good time to do that. And the next month, pick one person in your network who is a weaker tie, but with whom you'd like a stronger alliance. So somebody who thought, well, you know, I should reach out to that person or I haven't spoken to this person in a long time and just commit to trying to proactively reignite that relationship through small favors. And I'm talking about finding out something they're interested in sending them an article or two that you read this recent on the subjects or uh, helping them prepare for a presentation is something that I always like to do.

Speaker 2:          00:24:03       If you're, if you've got skills and the presentation department, that's always a good one because most people feel a lot of nerves and anxiety around it if you're in their corner or you can help them with their slides. Anything really simple, especially on a topic that you enjoy is a really, really good gift or favor so to speak. So invest in real time and energy into that relationship over the next several months and you will definitely see dividends that much a promise you and also create what I call an interesting people fund and funnel a certain percentage of your paycheck, certain very small certainly, but use this to pay for lunches, drinks, things like that. Even a plane ticket to visit someone or visit an area and have lunch with somebody or dinner with somebody with whom you want a stronger connection. And you guys have the super super hookup here at Google because you can invite people into the campus to have lunch, do a tour that is built in for you.

Speaker 2:          00:24:54       So if you haven't done that or if you haven't made good use of that over the past six, eight, 18 months or ever start doing that, maybe just once a month, time flies. But these things stack up these, this is compound interest. The other reason is that opportunities are often over the horizon. And what I mean by that is we often don't see the benefit that can come from helping other people or from reigniting relationships with other people. So right now a lot of you are thinking, well, okay, I know a bunch of people but I don't really know what I want from them or what they would want from me, so forget it. It's there's nothing I really need so I'm not going to do that. And that is a huge mistake because since opportunities are over the horizon, what that means is that you have no idea whether or not you can help them or they can help you.

Speaker 2:          00:25:42       Neither of you know this case in point. When I first moved to La, I had a too thick and if you've ever had a toothache, you probably know the pain is, it's like it's in your brain. This is some of the most intimate destructive pain that you can feel. It's so distracting. It's all consuming. It seems like it's inside your head and there's nothing you can do about it. There's not enough Tylenol in the house, there's not, there's not of painkillers commercially available without a prescription that are going to help you without killing you if you have a strong enough to think. And the problem was this was pre Uber. Okay, I didn't have a car at the point. I moved straight from New York to La. I had no dentist and my insurance was garbage. So of course I'm calling every dentist I can find in the yellow pages and they're saying like, oh, just go to the Er.

Speaker 2:          00:26:26       Just go to the ER, they'll take care of you. When you go to the Er with a tooth ache, I have a feeling they tie a string to it and slam the door and send you on your way home because as we all know, healthcare with no insurance or crappy insurance, especially dental, things like that, not the business, so I posted in on Facebook, does anybody have a dentist that I can use? I need to get this too thick handled so I can continue with my life and a total stranger because I have my privacy settings completely screwed up at this point, replies to the thread and says, actually, my aunt's a dentist in your area. I don't really know you, but it sounds like you're in pain. Do you want me to give her a call? Absolutely, I do. Absolutely. I walked down there bright and early before she even opens up shop.

Speaker 2:          00:27:09       They open, they take care of me. I don't get overcharged. I go home. A much happier camper than I was before. Now, of course I go home and I'm infinitely thankful to this particular stranger who I still to this day, I've never met, and I write back, thank you so much. You're saved my bacon here. And he says, great, I've really, I'm glad to do that. By the way, I'm looking for a job in graphic design. Of course there's a rub. Look, I'm not hiring a graphic designer. It would be really convenient for purposes of this story if I needed a graphic designer, but alas, I'm not gonna lie to you like that. So I said I would keep my ear to the ground for him, which translates roughly to, yeah, whatever, man. Thanks. Anyway, however, four days later, five days later, another entrepreneur hit me up and said, hey, your website looks really great.

Speaker 2:          00:27:53       I've had a lot of flaky designers. What do you think? Do you know anyone? Well, we do all of our design in house, and I said, look, I don't know anyone, but this random dude from Facebook gave me his portfolio. Here it is. It's attached. All I know is that he helped me find a dentist and he seems like a nice person. Not exactly qualifications you would want in somebody who you're going to hire fulltime for a position. Right. But it turns out that later on, after doing a series of discreet jobs for this entrepreneur, this particular individual ended up getting a full time job at this particular company. So he went from essentially working at a local cafe and posting about his job on Facebook every five minutes to getting a full time job in his industry of choice. The reason that this story is important and relevant is because I had no idea that I could get a dentist from a person.

Speaker 2:          00:28:43       I never knew I. That was obviously not something I forced saw, which was the reason I posted there in the first place. However, if he had literally asked every single person that he knew and then he'd ever met in his whole life for a job, he still would not have found the job that he got by helping me selflessly. That is what I mean by opportunities lying over the horizon. You don't know who you can help and you don't know who can help you. You have no idea, neither of you do and you won't find out until you start being generous with it. And that's why we have ABG, which is always be giving. Has anyone seen Glengarry Glen Ross? ABC always be closing. So I'll let you youtube that one later. But essentially it's about going after what you want and mercilessly getting it and forget everyone else at art of charm where rock and ABG always be generous or always be giving. And what this means is that since you're helping other people with no expectation of anything in return, you can find those opportunities that are lying over the horizon in many ways you can, it's not always going to be like this. Obviously this is a numbers game and a you want to be the guy or gal that looks like they're always just getting lucky and hitting the lottery because of the numbers. The way you increase your odds and a numbers game is you keep playing the game. You keep increasing the numbers.

Speaker 2:          00:30:07       So in the next week, introduce two or more people that you know already do not know each other and the way that you do this is not by surprise attacking them with an email where they're both cc to everyone hates that. You hate that. I hate that. Of course they hate that. Some people don't know this but I, that's why I always throw it out there. This is called the double opt in intro. Okay. You email one and you say, Hey, I know this Guy Bob. He works in graphic design like you and he's got a lot of capacity for work and he's really talented and then you reach out to the other person and you say, Hey, this guy James is really cool, super interesting guy, got a lot of work, always seems like he's got deal flow coming through. Are you open to meeting him? Do you guys know each other already?

Speaker 2:          00:30:49       If they both say yes, you make the intro. If one says no, you don't, and I know what you're thinking, Ooh, that's awkward. What do I tell the other person who said yes when one says no, the answer is you say the timing isn't right right now. True. No lying, and you leave it at that and if they ask you again in a few months, no problem. The only time that you would ever say anything else is if there's a serious issue with that, and that's sort of beyond the scope of this, but I would say that every time you double optin, you're most likely going to get a yes, especially from people that don't have a ton of incoming people that they call the introductions coming from people that they actually trust. Which by the way, is you people who are doing the ABG thing. We're networking well, who are building a lot of relationships will always say yes to an intro.

Speaker 2:          00:31:33       It doesn't mean they have to hire that person. It doesn't mean they have to have lunch. It just means they have to say yes to the email, which usually leads to some sort of call or even just a mutual connection so that they're on each other's radar. That alone is enough. If you're thinking about the the utility that each of these people have to the other person in the interaction, that alone is enough and if you do this in the next week, and if you do this once a week, you'll have made 52 give or take some nos introductions every single year, which is a ton, and once you start ramping this up, you realize this is actually really easy because if I need help with something or if you need help with something, the way that this becomes scalable. Again, going back to graphic design, let's say that I'm a graphic designer and you need help with your website. I don't have time to do your graphic design. I don't have time to do graphic design for everyone in this room. What I might have time to do is introduce everyone in this room to different capable designers. So what I've done is provided value, followed the ABG rule of giving and helping and being generous without actually doing really more than connecting one corner of my web to another part of my web that makes it scalable.

Speaker 2:          00:32:47       That's important because otherwise you will drive yourself freaking crazy and you'll lose your job and be homeless. Dot. A dot. The end on the other side of the equation, you've got to think about a challenge that you yourself are dealing with and you have to ask for help from their network as well. Where people get stuck with the ABG stuff is they go, oh great, I'm going to help everyone, and they start sending 58,000 email introductions every single week and they never ask for what they need and that becomes almost a pathology. If you're there, great. It's a good sign that you're doing some stuff right. Start asking for what you need. People want to help you in return. It's reciprocity, which is a human law, psychology, and it closes the loop. I like to say because I always feel a little bit of, wow, I really want, I want to do something for that person. You know, they've been so generous with me. If you allow them to do that, they feel good about helping you as well. There's not really a better win than there can be from those two particular things hitting simultaneously or at some point in the same three, six month, even year time span. So

Speaker 3:          00:33:51       yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:33:52       we've already talked about why networking is valuable. We've already talked about how to introduce people to one another. We've already talked about how to make it scalable and we've talked about helping people and finding those opportunities over the horizon. The other reason to do this selfishly or not so selfishly is that your network is unique to you. You can have a bank account with no money in it. We've all been there and you have value to offer somebody with $10 million, whatever, a bajillion dollars in their bank account because you and your network, your network really is one of the only things about you that is truly unique. I know we're going to probably, there's going to be some discussion about how we're all special snowflakes and usually that comes at the end of this, but I will tell you that your network is one of the only things that is unique to you.

Speaker 2:          00:34:36       It's one of the only things you have that nobody else or very few other people have, especially if you've been building it up over time. So business of course, fundamentally is people selling things to people that they already, ideally no doing business with people you know and like is one of the most common ways to do this. See the Dave example in the beginning of this particular discussion, and everyone's already heard, well you only go as high as your five closest friends. And I'm not saying ditch your friends. That would be like the opposite of a of a Tony Robbins seminar probably, but we're not gonna. We're not gonna do that here. Networking and relationship development is one of the single best ways to make sure that you're surrounding yourself with as many high quality people as possible. You're doing a great job. You're in this room here at Google, not bad so far, keep it up.

Speaker 2:          00:35:22       But many people in this company and outside this company are running into the problem where maybe professionally they're surrounded with all stars, maybe personally not so much or sometimes the inverse depends on what department you're in here. I guess that's what I've heard. So in the next day, take a look at your appointment book, your calendar, your Google calendar hopefully and over the past three to six months, who have you surrounded yourself with? Who have you been hanging out with professionally and personally, with whom have you spent the most time and are you happy with the influence those people have had on you? Because a lot of people think that they can resist that, but you all know you do fall into the same habits in the same traps is the people that you're surrounding yourself with voluntarily or not and that's why it's so toxic to be around people who don't have the same values as you who don't have the same ways of thinking and mindsets of success, happiness and things like that.

Speaker 2:          00:36:14       Then you do now caveat, this is not a game you play just because you want the spoils. It is important to me personally to help people buy a whole company. The Art of charm is founded on that basis and I like helping people. I like coming and speaking to people. I love seeing people succeed and I love interacting and if somebody does not have integrity, do not build your network around them. It is so tempting to do this. It is so tempting to go, well, this person's high up on this totem pole. They're really good at this particular thing. They have high visibility in this area, but they're a total scumbag. That will always, always, always come back to bite you in the butt. You just have to zoom out far enough on the timeline to see how that's happened with those people in other areas and you will see yourself becoming a victim of that same thing.

Speaker 2:          00:36:59       If you don't believe me, look at what those people have been around before and zoom out on the timeline and you will find an example of your future if you associate with those people. I mean it's also important, this whole, this entire process is important because unless you've been intentional about the process of surrounding yourself with better people and leveling up in that area, your immediate surroundings in social circle, there's a pretty darn good chance that it's loaded with people who are satisfied being essentially mediocre in whatever area that you're trying to level up in or one or two areas that you're trying to level up in health, fitness, professional life. We've all got those people that are have kind of been around us for a long time that maybe are no longer adding value but subtracting it a little bit of an energy vampire.

Speaker 2:          00:37:45       One might say, and if you surround yourself with high achievers at work and at home, you will absolutely crush. You will crush it. They will bring you up and you can bring them up with you as well and people like I said, want to help you. If you're excited about helping them get their goals accomplished, they will get excited about doing the same for you. Always be giving and you will get that as simple reciprocity. And this is something that high performers rely on all the time, every single time. If you want to look at charities for example, they're loaded with the well to do and there's a reason for that. It's not just about being social, it's a way for people in distinct silos to be around other people that they would normally never get to interact with while working on a common goal. That is a very sort of tricky thing to wrap your mind around sometimes, especially when you just see it from the outside. But when you get in the middle of that, you realize that most of those people are thinking like that. It's a strategy. It's not coincidence.

Speaker 3:          00:38:39       Okay?

Speaker 2:          00:38:39       The number one rule of relationship building is to build it before you need it. Dig the well before you're thirsty.

Speaker 2:          00:38:49       Networking. Once you need something like a job or a relationship for example, that is not effective. And a lot of people think they can do that. How many people have been like, oh, you know, I'm totally gonna start this relationship development thing, but I've got to get this project done. I've got to move up one rung on the ladder at work. Um, I've got to get this website going. I really need to, uh, you know, get my move handled first and get settled in my new place. Some sort of excuse to false deadline is often what keeps us from moving forward. We have to ditch those because think about this, who would you rather help? Somebody who's helped you out with a few things over the last few months in the last few years or someone that calls you out of the blue and is like, hey man, yeah, what's up man? I want to take you out for a beer. It's been such a long time and then you get there and they're like Herbalife or whatever, right? You're just like, ah, God, I knew it or I knew this is going to happen. Waiting to form relationships only once you need them. It's like carrying a spare tire in the trunk of your car after you're stranded on the side of the highway. It's not good. So here's a thought exercise for you.

Speaker 3:          00:39:50       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:39:51       Imagine that you got laid off from your job today. Not going to happen. Hopefully. Now you have my personal guarantee. How's that? You got laid off from your job today. Who are the 10 people that you would contact for help if that happened? You get laid off today. Who are you contacting 10 people for help and figure out what you're going to do next. Make that list of 10 people. Then reach out to them now when you don't need anything, if you've been laid off, you know that's a good idea.

Speaker 2:          00:40:23       So networking, creating those relationships only when you need it, it's not effective. It is too late. 80% of new jobs are found through networks, not through monster.com you don't want to see the stats on that. Nobody looks at their inbox even they're using the new Gmail spam filters and stuff like that. It doesn't matter. It's all via the network and everyone who works at my company, everyone who works at the art of charm has gotten their job by networking and relationships. That obviously makes sense because that's what we teach. You will find that works in 80% of cases and when you get to higher performing jobs, better jobs that are higher paid compensation or involve different or better projects, that number, that percentage goes much, much higher because the job, the stakes are too high to rely on a simple recruiting process that doesn't have a little finger on the scale from relationships and previous vetting from people who've been there or know that person.

Speaker 2:          00:41:17       So this is about action. It's not about collecting business cards, it's not about your Rolodex if those things still exist, which I doubt the best way to do this is to create a platform to do this. A lot of people of industry blogs, my platform is my podcast, the art of charm. It puts me in visible place. It puts me in a position to interact with interesting people that have other connections and connect with connect doors. So if you don't have a podcast so you don't have the big old blog or you can't talk about what you're working on, which was a lot of you, I know that the greatest way I found to do this is to organize little low key low pressure dinner parties with people in similar or different industries that are relevant enough. We're one person each time can teach the group something, so you might have a dinner party at your place and you might teach a little bit of Seo.

Speaker 2:          00:42:04       I don't know if you guys are allowed to do that. That's my go to example, but whatever, put something else in there instead. Somebody might teach outsourcing that might be a better one for you. Social media is a good one. Uh, these are things that are pretty default. These work really well with entrepreneurs. They work really great for people in general who are interested in business. Y'All are pretty technical. Some of you I would imagine, and you can teach certain discreet skills to the group in a way that doesn't set you up for any sort of trouble at work, but also sets you up on a platform and if you're hosting these dinner parties, you can invite different people. You can insist they bring one other person that you don't yet know and someone who's been there the previous week comes prepared that next week to teach a subject doesn't have to be an hour long lecture can be something really simple.

Speaker 2:          00:42:48       It doesn't have to be white boarded, just has to be interesting and valuable enough to keep people showing up and keep the event fun enough that people continue to come and continue to bring others into that. This sets you up as the network hub. It sets you up as the connector and if you can connect with other connectors, now you're cooking with gas. Of course, my platform, like I said, is a podcast and look, networking is a muscle. It grows with use. It is not a pie that gets eaten up piece by piece. If you call in help from somebody that is not going to use up that contact. A lot of people operate like that. They're afraid to call on somebody. Well I don't want to email them about this because you know, then I've used my one time that I can get in touch.

Speaker 2:          00:43:27       No, it's quite the opposite. It's a muscle that grows with use. The more you network, the more you introduce people to others and where you create that value, the more you ABG, the more that muscle will grow. And if you hoard your network, it will atrophy the same as a muscle as well. So it all comes back to ABG and doing so in a systemized way. And uh, one final sort of example here of asking for help because I know a lot of people are shy with that. I didn't get into law school the first time I applied. I didn't get in at all. In fact, I got rejected and I remember sitting in a house up north and just thinking, wow, that was my hail Mary at figuring out what I was going to do for the next three years. I can't even get a job at freaking best buy with a college degree from the University of Michigan.

Speaker 2:          00:44:13       I'm so screwed. I don't even know what I'm going to do right now. I should just walk into the Great Lakes that I'm looking at right now and just keep walking and figure out, figure it out from there. I mean there was nothing happening. So in desperation, I reached out to a lot of my friends who had already been admitted. They were a year ahead of me, a couple months ahead of a semester ahead of me or just getting in at that same level and I said, what would you do? And they said, all right, write a letter that explains why you should be let in and send me a copy and I will look at it. Almost everybody said something similar along those lines because I had them all on one thread and so I wrote this letter. I figured this is just such a waste of time. I don't, I don't even know why I'm doing this, but they kind of forced me to do it.

Speaker 2:          00:44:56       I was just going to say, great, thanks for the suggestion and not do it. My friend Greg, thank God he made me do this. So I sent it back. I got a bunch of corrections based on the way that they've learned their legal pros and argumentation. Put it in a really interesting format that I'd never seen before. It looked like a legal brief of some kind and I sent it to the admissions office and a couple of those guys and gals sent letters to the admissions office telling them why you think it was a mistake that I wasn't let in into the school at some point. And I was definitely Michigan material. Um, cause I went for Undergrad and law school just to avoid confusion. And so after a few weeks I got a call from the admissions office and they said, look, never seen anybody do this.

Speaker 2:          00:45:35       This is a really interesting idea. And the fact that you put this into such a coherent argument in a letter, you sent it back, you weren't expecting anything. And my trade off was, you don't have to let me in for this year. Let me in for next year and I will kill the rest of it. I'll figure out what to do with my time. And we all know how you can kill a year in college pretty easily. And so they said, fine, we'll, we'll convene the admissions committee, we have another meeting and I'll run it by them. And they called a few days later and they let me in, not for that year, but for the next year just as I had suggested. So think about this. I got into one of the best law schools in America where, where an I'd previously been rejected because I asked for help. Those people were glad to do it. We're still friends to this day and I'm still getting a reminder every single month about how valuable that law degree was. So all right, now I think we've got a little bit of time left. Uh, you keeping time. You get, we're good. Great. So let's go to Serbia. So here's a, here's a more fun example of the law school in my humble opinion.

Speaker 2:          00:46:35       So in 2005 is 25 years old and I worked for was actually coincidentally killing year before law school and I had a fellowship from the Department of Defense to go and work in Serbia, which is in the former Yugoslavia, not Siberia, Serbia, different place, former Yugoslavia, southern Balkans, Europe area. And when you go to Serbia, you have to register with the government and tell them where you're living. And the police have to stamp this little piece of paper that says you're a foreigner living in the country. And now that's really foreign to Americans. But if you've ever been to the eastern block, this is super commonplace. They love to keep tabs on everybody and everything and you have to live with a Serbian person. You can't live on your own. You can't just stay in some house that you rent on Airbnb, which didn't exist at the time.

Speaker 2:          00:47:22       You're not allowed to do anything like that. You have to have somebody who is vouching for you. And this got really annoying because every time I left the country or left even the county city area where I was, I had to reregister so I had to, every single time I would take a drive to a restaurant outside of Belgrade. I had to reregister with the police and that was never a smooth process, often involved in an annoying fee and also was salted in me having a couple of incidences that really got old fast. For example, I was coming back from a visit to Germany. I came back at about 11 o'clock at night or 10 ended up in the police station where the registration has done around 10 11 at night and the police officer who was on duty there decided that since I was in the police station at that hour, I must've done something wrong even though I walked in alone and he put me in a prison cell with three chain smoking prostitutes who spoken aloud as foreign language for the entire night, smoking unfiltered cigarettes and it was one of the worst nights of my entire life and I decided this is not happening again.

Speaker 2:          00:48:22       I am not doing this registration thing. This is an offense to freedom everywhere. I'm not doing this. And so I decided, I'm just going to say to hell with this. They're not, they're so disorganized, they're never even gonna find me. Well, I'll let you know how that goes. So I could see the brilliant plants have my friends say that I was staying with them even though I wasn't. And then you know, what are the police gonna do come in and specs and see where I live. So the police came and inspected to see where I live and I wasn't there. And they said, Yo, yeah, he's traveling. Did they said, okay, fine. And so they came back about two weeks later and they said, where's his stuff? Oh, he's not here. And so the police gave my friend yelling at an ultimatum and they said, if he's not here the next time that we come, we're going to look for him.

Speaker 2:          00:49:06       But you're going to help us and you're going to stay with us until we find them. And that was pretty loud and clear for guess what Jordan, you're moving tonight at 1:30 AM luckily moving was easy, didn't have anything at our house. But what it did mean is that I had to go to the police station and register again and I decided fine, I'm going to do that. So I decided to pull the same thing cause it worked for a few months with another friend and that guy went and moved to his weekend house, like a cottage for months. So he wasn't home. So what the police found when they went to inspect again was not only was I not there, nobody was there at all for a long, long time and that raised a red flag and when you live in the eastern block, red flags mean trouble.

Speaker 2:          00:49:48       So this started to get really scary for them, right? That my friend was getting calls because I was registered there and I was hanging out and thinking, look, this is fine. You know, I'll just go and fix this. But Serbia is not exactly the kind of place where you walk into the police station. As I've learned before. And say, Hey, I heard you guys have been looking for me. What can I do for you? So I decided I'm going to handle this. Just not right now. So I had an appointment at the American embassy to take care of everything. But before that I had tickets to a music festival and this was going to be awesome. So I went into the music festival. It's three days long and it was on this Turkish fortress island. It looks like game of Thrones. In fact, I think they may have filmed some game of Thrones stuff there.

Speaker 2:          00:50:27       It's a, it's an island that is an Ottoman Empire fortress and there's 20 stages set up here when they have this festival, no cars allowed. Huge. I mean it is, it is just mindblowingly enormous and cool and everything was going so well. I'd been up for probably like a day and a half partying, hanging out with my friends, drinking. Um, we did some weird cameo on MTV Europe where I didn't understand what they were saying to me, but it didn't matter and I just, I couldn't have been having more fun. But there was a black jeep that started rolling around the island towards when everybody was getting done and they were kind of inspecting people and looking through the crowd and shining the light on people as dawn broke and everyone has to leave on this bridge and walk on this bridge. And so as we started to do that, they stopped a friend of mine and me and they said, where are your passports?

Speaker 2:          00:51:19       Because in Serbia you have to carry your passport with you everywhere you go. If you're a foreigner, you have to have your international id with you no matter what. I carried a copy because who's going to carry their passport? You're going to lose it hold big thing. So I carried a copy of my passport. That was not satisfactory. So what did they do? They called to make sure that I was who I said I was. But guess what happened when they called? He's not registered. We've been looking for him. Whoops. Also to add a little bit of something else, something special to the pot. My friend had a bit of a checkered past where he was related to an organized crime figure from his family and they had moved and then he came back to hang out in Serbia. So these guys figure we've hit the frigging jackpot.

Speaker 2:          00:52:01       You know, we've got an American spy who's basically a fugitive and some mafiosos kid. So at this point I think, great, you know, we're going to jail, hopefully not worse and make things a little bit worse. These guys were not sober. These guys were on drugs. And to put this into a little bit of perspective, Serbian state security officers at this point in time, they're not like the American FBI. These are guys who fly in militias and Bosnia or whatever. Their village got eradicated by Cro ads or Bosniaks or whatever. Now they live in Serbia. And in order to not be prosecuted for war crimes or things that they did back there that were illegal, they became agents of the state that are above regular prosecution laws. So they basically just run around, do whatever they want, except for any, obviously not getting any therapy for their PTSD and all of the things that are causing them to be hammered at 7:38 AM in the morning.

Speaker 2:          00:52:55       So they're slurring, they're not rational, they're aggressive. And I'm thinking, great, I'm going to get pistol whipped in front of like 20,000 people and there's nothing I can do about it. And my friend is all doing the, the the classic, let me talk my way out of this type thing. And that's not going too well. And I'm replying. Look man, I don't, I'm not a fugitive, I'm not a criminal. I just teach refugees English and I'm not, look, here's my passport. We can go get the real one. We'll go to the embassy and it'll make a not a big deal out of it. And they were, they thought that was an okay idea. But first they had other ideas, so they said get in the jeep. And the problem is when you speak a foreign language, often those little connector words like get in or get over are kind of confusing.

Speaker 2:          00:53:39       So when they said get in the jeep, I thought, great, I'm going to get in the jeep. And it turned out that they meant get on the jeep and what they meant I get on the jeep was that they didn't want me to be inside because the back had a bunch of rifles in it and a bag of Doritos, which is kind of weird. They didn't want me to sit there. So me and my friend had to hang onto the running boards and we're hanging onto the side of the running boards and our hand through the open sunroof of the jeep and they're going pretty slowly at this point to drive off this island where there's no roads, no cars. After we get over the bridge, we start cruising a little bit and they start throwing popcorn out through the sunroof because I forgot to tell you this, they robbed a popcorn vendor before we left the venue.

Speaker 2:          00:54:18       So these guys are throwing the popcorn up through the roof and they're trying to get us to catch it in our mouths while we're driving on the highway. We're going 40 miles an hour and I'm thinking, oh, this is great. I should just like a tuck and roll or something. Right? Except when you're going 40 miles an hour, you're just kind of thinking, what part of me is going to fly off if I do that? So no talking, no rolling. Then I saw the flashing lights, flashing lights. Thank God the police are here. They're going to pull us over. They're going to find out how ridiculous this is. They're going to cut us loose or they're going to send it straight back to the embassy. Worst case, I get deported. I can live with that. Okay. The problem is these guys unrolled their window and did one of these and the cops turned their lights off and pulled over to the side of the road because again, black jeep government plates, it doesn't matter if we're on the side trying to catch popcorn like a couple of clowns so that this point, I'm starting to get really scared, right?

Speaker 2:          00:55:07       Because 15 minutes later we pull up into this neighborhood, small boarded up houses and little things with like those, those shutters, those metal grates are down over the front. And I'm thinking, oh my God, this is serious. This is not harmless fun. This isn't just people having fun with some tourists. This is the real deal. And I'm cut off from the world and I haven't been this scared since prom, 98 different story. And I'm like, freaking out here. You know, don't want to get out of the jeep or off the jeep. I don't want to get into the house. I don't want to go down to the basement of the house. And the guy says, look, get in there and everything's gonna be okay. Pardon me if I don't believe you. Okay. But that was the message.

Speaker 2:          00:55:48       And at this point I'm scared. I don't know what to do. Can't run anywhere. I've got nowhere to go. So we go in, we sit down, they're bashing my friend. And because now he decided to play the Dune. Do you know who my father is? Game works every time. And, uh, so I'm explaining, look, I'm an English teacher man. I teach 11 year old kids in refugees, how to speak English. That is it. They're calling bs on that. You're a spy. You're a unregistered. You're an unregistered foreign agent. Nobody had heard of that until Michael Flynn. Thanks Flynn. Not Don't have to explain that one every time. So it's a no, you know, we're on our way to Lipa. It's got the best food in town. I heard they got the best food anywhere in the city and he gets heated. This agent, it's heated and incredulous and a little tense.

Speaker 2:          00:56:29       A little too close to my face and says, obviously you don't know anything about Serbian food if you think Lipa has the best food in the city. And I thought, all right, now we're on to something better here. What about his knocked Pete's on Yon Belgrade, man, look, if you haven't tried stepping via to you don't know anything about this and you're not qualified to talk about Serbian foods. So I ask him what he orders when he goes there. This is something that changes the energy of the conversation. At Art of charm, we call this changing the frame of the conversation. It goes from me being interrogated by a crazy, deranged drunk state state security agent to a somewhat equal footing discussion, if you will, on Serbian food and culture, and the key is that I kept behaving like I wasn't in trouble and that everything, even though he was enraged at certain points, even totally irrationally, I'm remaining as completely calm on the outside anyways, I can obviously inside and freaking out without any regard whatsoever, and I ask him, look man, what are you order when you go there?

Speaker 2:          00:57:25       I'm going to go there tonight. Wink, wink, right when I got out of here and I'm setting that anchor, man, let me Outta here. I even invited him to go with us. Seriously. Now this type of thing is called the Benjamin Franklin effect. When you ask somebody for advice, when you ask somebody for recommendations, they feel an affinity for you. They feel an affinity for what you are representing. They feel an affinity for helping you and it's a backwards rationalization that they create in the brain. Benjamin Franklin used this really, really well. He would borrow books from people that hated him and they would become friends. That's why this is called the Benjamin Franklin effect. So we started talking about a homebrew liqueur called Rakia. And of course, the only thing that's Serbian people, like more than talking about drinking, is drinking. So I said, I think I could use a drink right now.

Speaker 2:          00:58:14       It's about eight o'clock in the morning. Don't judge me. Desperate times, desperate measures. So he gets up and you suddenly walks out of the room and I'm thinking, okay, great. This is my time. Activate eighth grade taekwondo skills, uh, wrestling, middle school wrestling. Sure. Leg catch something, right? And then Dee come out and run. That's the plan. Sounds good, right? What could go wrong? And sometimes the unknown is scarier than the known. You know, you don't know what's going to happen. This guy's gone. I can hear my friend and his butt kicked in. The next room is getting punched in the ever. I mean, it's just awful. I'm sitting there like to things saw, hadn't come out at this point or it would have been losing it, right. There's like sharp objects in there and pipes coming out of the wall and these little rusty things and I'm like, that could get attached to a part of my body if I'm not careful.

Speaker 2:          00:58:56       So I could see him coming back and he's got a club in his hand and I'm like, oh my God, this is how it ends, you know? And I thought, all right, I've got about a whatever percent chance of just getting away from this guy and figuring out how to dodge it or tackle him or something like that. And about 10 feet away from me, I realize it's not a club but a bottle and it's a bottle of rocky up and he slams it down the table. He pours a couple of glasses of his stuff and he says, well, you know, we're just going to wait for your friend and my friend to get done talking. And I thought, okay, well look, I mean this is not nice, but this is an airplane mask. Situations like help yourself before you help the other people next to you.

Speaker 2:          00:59:35       So I'm wondering how I can get myself out of this and get my friend out of this. But so far I'm pretty much out of ideas. The first idea I have is drink that shot and then regroup and then come up with a new plan. So I realize this could still go sideways, right? This is still happening. We're, this is a heated conversation, right? We're going back and forth. And finally I hear from the next room, hey, you know, your friend has a big mouth. I'm shutting it for him. How's it going over there? Right? And these guys don't really know that I can understand Serbian. So I figured this could really, really be bad for my friend and it could just as easily be bad for me. This just right now I feel okay with it. Right? And your brain wants to do that.

Speaker 2:          01:00:12       It wants to think everything's gonna be fine. Everything's gonna be all right. It doesn't necessarily mean it has any basis in reality. So I said, look man, I feel really sick. You know, I've been awake for a long time. You're feeding me this stuff. I'm stressed out, I'm dehydrated. I just need water. And I know there's no water in there. I know those rusty pipes have no water. I know they don't have any water. I know the jeep doesn't probably have any water because they finished the beers they were drinking as they drove us to this place. So he goes, all right, stay here. And I said, of course, where? Where would I go? So he gets up and he goes in the other room and after a long time, it feels like an eternity. I hear the jeep doors close and I've realized they're gone.

Speaker 2:          01:00:53       They left and I don't know if they're coming back. So I grow and grabbed my friend, dude, get up, we got to go. He's half limping, half being carried out of this place. And we go to a restaurant a few hundred meters away, a few blocks away. And I know what we must have looked like because we're covered in dirt and blood and popcorn and the waitress is coming up and she goes, hi, how can I interest? Immediately doesn't even finish. The sentence starts walking away and I thought, wow, we look like zombies. We look like zombies that were junkies when they were alive and now are zombies. And so the police come, the regular police, thank God who take us, get arrest us again, take us to a police station instead of an underground torture chamber. So I'm still on, I'm still ahead here. This is good. Right? And then at this point I am getting interrogated by the police captain and he's just like, what is going, where did you even come from?

Speaker 2:          01:01:40       And this town looking like this at this hour, what are, what is going on here? And my Serbians, not that my smoking, Serbians, not that great. Especially with a couple of booze, a bits of booze in me that hour, no sleep. And I'm new. I can understand more than I can speak. That's how it goes with foreign languages. So I asked him if he spoke German. He spoke German and he said, no, I don't speak German, but my girlfriend is a German teacher. Thank God. So I get on the phone with her, I'm on the phone in the police station in Serbia telling a police captains girlfriend in German. What happened to me when I got arrested by their secret service telling her this ridiculous story left out the part about robbing a popcorn vendor. And at first she's like, okay, I'm not sure I believe anything that you're saying, but she's a language teacher and I'm a language teacher. I'm there to teach English. So I start asking her, look, do you know my boss? Do you know the person who ran this convention? Do you know the person who wrote the textbook where I did the English voiceover? Do you know the other teachers that I met at these various mixers for teachers when I was teaching language in Belgrade? And that is one, her attitude changed since we had these mutual connections. See, actually believe what was going on here because she didn't know me, but she knew people that knew me.

Speaker 3:          01:02:50       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:02:53       Again, it's all about relationship. She's not buying who I was. He's not buying the story until she buys who I was. So she's embarrassed. She's embarrassed on behalf of the country. She tells the police captain, look, let us go. They cut us loose, and they did, and were obviously look like we're up to something covered. Drunk, covered a dirt, blood and popcorn. And so as you can see, the advanced social skills that are taught this rapport, this networking concept, the ABG big concepts that we talked about today, and the concepts that we teach at the art of charm can not only help you keep your job, get a new job, start your business, keep your side also going, or just help you advance in your personal life. But they're actually the reason I'm still kicking and talking to you here today, and that is my time. Thank you so much. This has been a real honor and I appreciate your attention.
