Speaker 1:          00:06          Please welcome to the stage, the death wish coffee company. So, uh, there are a lot of you up here and I know you guys all have very unique and complicated catered roles inside the company, so it would probably be best. Why don't you guys just go down the line, introduce yourself and let people know what you do.

Speaker 2:          00:25          My name is Mike Brown. I'm the owner of founders, CEO and chief janitor at Deathwish coffee.

Speaker 1:          00:32          Uh, my name is Dustin Alexander. I do a shipping, I do inventory and I do purchasing. I'm also part of the podcast with Jeff to rally on the marketing manager at at death wish.

Speaker 2:          00:44          Um, came Grogan and I run our customer service department, some of our events stuff and a sales wholesale, stuff like that.

Speaker 1:          00:53          I'm Jeff airs, I run our brand new broadcasting division and I write and edit and produce our weekly podcast fueled by death cast a, my name is Alyssa hardy and I'm the content manager at death wish. So the reason why we brought Deathwish here today, and I think it's relevant to a lot of Googlers, is um, there's this great sort of just like homecoming king esque type story of starting out in a basement and just the explosion of the past five years that your company has gone through. Why don't you recap, uh, the history of the company for us?

Speaker 2:          01:27          Yeah. So back in 2008, I opened Saratoga coffee traders and it was a small coffee shop in Saratoga Springs, New York. And I learned pretty quickly that I didn't know how to run a very good business because I lost all my money. I lost it all and all my went out the door. But I was very, um, uh, I didn't want to be a failure. So I kept trying and trying and trying and doing everything I could. I actually hired my best friend, Scott to come work with me for basically free and we just struggled then every single day we were in that shop trying to figure out how to make it in a brick and mortar business. And then one day or like, why don't we try to sell our coffee online? And that's why we developed a death wish coffee. And it was, it was a, a recommendation from our customers because they would always come in and be like, Hey, can I have, you know, give me your strongest coffee. And we'd go and be like, all right, do they want the darkest coffee? Are they, do they want the most caffeinated coffee? And we're like, well, wait a minute and let's just sit down for a minute and figure this out. Let's make a coffee that's not only dark, not only tastes strong, but also has the most caffeine. And, and that's what we did. You know, we, we, we, we developed this coffee by just blend. Will we, there are a lot of experimentation.

Speaker 1:          02:45          Well, let's, let's back up because I do think it's important to qualify a death wish. Coffee is known online as the world's strongest coffee. Yes. How do you qualify and quantify what that means to be the world's strongest coffee? Yeah. You know, I was never focused caffeine at the

Speaker 2:          03:00          outset. It was always about taste and flavor. Um, caffeine informer and a few other publications online, uh, uh, deemed us the world's strongest coffee with caffeine levels. But I dunno, we personally, I don't like to focus on that. It just cause you can brew coffee stronger by just adding more coffee and using less water. Um, so to me it was all about flavor and good flavor and, you know, the, and everything that, you know, when I, when I drink a cup of coffee in the morning, I want to wake up. Right. You know, I want, I want to, I want it to hit my like taste buds, the chute open. That's what I focused on that, that experience. Um, but going back to your question, like I said, I don't like to focus on the caffeine, but caffeine does have something to do with it. And we, because we use reboost to beans. Uh, reboost beans have between two and three times the, the, the typical caffeine content of Arabica beans. Um, we do naturally get more caffeine in our club.

Speaker 1:          04:00          Yeah. And that's a big part of it, right? Because it, one would think that it would be easy to make a, you know, a new world's strongest coffee. You just go make a coffee and then find a bunch of caffeine and caffeine. Yeah. So, but that's not really what's going on you guys or have brewed this batch of beans and roasted in such a way, uh, to just naturally get this effect without having to force it. Yup. It's organic. It's fair trade. There's no additives. We don't add any caffeine to it or it's just pure coffee and that's, you know, we're purists, believe it or not. And we love, we love just straight black drip coffee. Sure. So, so you find this niche and you say, okay, I can start, people are demanding a certain thing for me. The strongest coffee, high caffeine, but also really bold flavor. Uh, we got that and we want to get it out to the people. So you left brick and mortar behind and just said, we can do this via the web?

Speaker 2:          04:53          Yeah, pretty much. I mean, it's still in my coffee shop right now. It's doing better, thank God. But yes, we, we, we took staff of the online market cause my customer like, hey, why don't you try selling this online? And I was like, all right, I'll try. And you know, I sold the bag via Google ads. I was how I sold my first bag and they said, and I got my first good review. And the guy was like, I still remember his name, Phil Bron. Um, how to Oakland. I filled in horrible. Yeah, I felt okay the first bag. And he gave me a good review. It's like this is some strong coffee and it's the, or some of the best coffee ever had. And from the air, like that review lead it up to another sale and another sale. So I was selling basically one pound a week and then two pounds a week and three pounds a week.

Speaker 2:          05:43          And all of a sudden it just snowballed into this company where it was me at first me and, uh, one of my experts does Megan. And then one day, good morning America, give me a call and they're like, hey, we've heard about your coffee online, we want to open the show with it tomorrow. Can we come up and interview interview you? And I was like, at that moment, ponder that you'd think. I would say yes immediately, but I don't know there's that, it was a, I don't know. For me it was a great step because I, I knew I wanted it, but I didn't know if I was ready, but I was just like, yes. And they came that day. I'm like, when are you going to come? I was thinking like a week or two. They're like, we'll be there in three hours. So they good morning America show up at my store and three hours I closed the store, I cleaned it up and they interviewed me and the next morning they open.

Speaker 2:          06:36          Good Morning America drinking death, wish coffee in our mugs. And Sam champion was a weatherman at the time and he, he was our coffee expert and he said, this is some great coffee. And then from there orders took off. Like, I didn't have enough coffee, enough bags, enough people. Um, and that's how basically higher and everyone, it's just because it was just me at the time and I was like, oh my God, I have all these orders I have to fulfill. Where am I going to find people to help me do this? So I went to my co, my customers and my coffee shop and I literally asked my customers, can you help me fulfill these orders? And that's, and that's where like everyone, that's where it started and that's where I found like the greatest people, which brings us to a lot of you guys. And the, the interesting thing I find about that is it's like you said, you, you pick

Speaker 3:          07:26          bull that you knew or people who are customers are yours. You guys are not necessarily Barista coffee. Hey, related. Yeah. Yeah. I knew nothing about marketing though. I mean, I know a little bit about coffee, but, so how was the, we're skipping a few major, major points. What are the major? So one of the things that, um, Mike, uh, as admitted in that, that, you know, rags to riches story is that, uh, he was looking for a way to supplement some income because the, um, the coffee shop was failing and you know, he found a product that worked out and they, him and Megan would just reach out to massive amounts of just an email. It's like cold emails, like, Hey, we have the world traumas, coffee. That's how good morning America found it. It was literally in a basement and they were just sending emails and like, we have this thing and it got mentioned in a few other publications first.

Speaker 3:          08:13          And then when good morning America came, um, it was way worse than, than what Mike just said when all those orders came in. And, and I came on at that point, I'm taking him on a little bit after that are a good friend, Eric Donovan was there who, you know, personally. Um, and there was thousands and thousands of orders. And I remember just seeing it there were in this basement where the floor is not really finished and it's like shorter than I am tall and it was just piles and piles of orders and we were like stickering back's feeling coffee, like weighing it out one bag at a time. And it was insane. Um, we got kicked off of Amazon, we got a lifetime ban off of Ebay because people thought we were scams. Um, that was interesting. So it took us what was scammy, they didn't get their back like on our website at the time, which if you could go back there is, I'm sure you guys know there's you, there's an archive.org or whatever it is, where you can see what the Google way back machine way back machine. I wouldn't have bought it. So that's on them cause they bought it off that website.

Speaker 3:          09:13          Slash slash I was a web developer of that website. It converted like crazy. First of all, the conversion rate on there is better than it is now. You'll get it in five days and it's like three, four weeks. And, and, uh, we thought it was a dead company. I didn't get hired for three. I kept coming back every day for three months. I didn't get actually get hired because we didn't think it was going to be company after that. Like, well, we just watched the ship sink and a let's play the titanic song as we go down. And, uh, it wasn't that, you know, we, we, uh, through customer service, uh, and just apologizing to everybody and saying, you're going to get it. Um, people kept ordering. And then we spent the next year and a half trying to build a foundation, um, to the company. Uh, we moved into a warehouse.

Speaker 3:          09:53          We begged and begged and begged Amazon and Ebay to let us back on, um, and called me in Amazon. And I think in on Google too. And, and the Internet for a lot of times, we're the number one coffee and sometimes the number one grocery products, Amazon. So that was just an, a, an a test, a testament to Mike and him just being like, we're going to do this the right way. We're not going to screw people over. We're not going to, you know, fold. We're just going to give everybody what we promised and uh, and we were able to deliver and it was a pretty amazing time for the company.

Speaker 1:          10:21          One of the common threads of the story, uh, seems to be this, this foundation based around communication. You guys are very, very communicative to, like you said, people were placing an order, expecting it in five days. You're then reaching out to them three weeks later and communicating the delays. Um, but this is not uncommon. Like you guys embraced the online space. You guys embraced so much social media. Talk about why going that route. Like it, you could easily have taken out a loan and spent $100,000 on a marketing campaign, but going this route, it seems to have been very effective for you. Yeah. Our number one value is customer status.

Speaker 2:          10:57          And we, we, I give everyone absolute freedom to go above and beyond to make sure our customers are satisfied and happy. And, and I, I know people say that a lot, especially businesses, but our number two value is profitability. And it's all, it's, it's a ranking system. So we will, because customer satisfaction is our number one value. And then to be profitable is, uh, you know, it's two or three or four, I can't remember exactly, but we will take losses to make our customers happy. So we'll go above and beyond to do that. One story I'm thinking of it just pops into my head, uh, is one, one day a customer called, and he was very upset with our cake gumps because we had the new k cups and Kira came out with a new brewer, the Keurig 2.0 and the guy's like, you know, I bought your cops, they don't work in my new machine.

Speaker 2:          11:51          And he's like, he was very upset and I'm like, you don't mess with people's coffee. Yeah, exactly. So I was like, oh, I'm like, how am I going to fix this problem? So I talked to the customer service and they were like, oh, we can send them another bag. And I'm like, no, you know, let's just send them a new, like a better brewer. So we went and we found that the top rated a single serve brewer. And we sent this guy like a brand new brewer. And it wasn't that, it wasn't a cure. Grand was, it was, I think it was the ox box and you know, it was just the top rated brewer at the time. And we sent that to them and I've never, and that guy, he turned out to be a CEO of like some like big construction company. And he was floored. He like, you guys are amazing. And to me that's going to say, I don't know, that means a lot about my customer service team that they would think of it think to do that. And that's what we're all about, just making people's day, like being able to provide that type of values. Who are our customers where it's not just, um, you know, here's another bag of cups, you know, good luck. You know, we want to really embrace customer service.

Speaker 1:          12:57          Well, it seems to go more than just embracing good customer service because you've expanded out into social media in unique ways. Uh, that again foster communication and sort of community, uh, which is interesting for a consumable product company, I think. And, and that sort of leaves us, leads us into the conversation about the podcast. So as part of all the social media growth, you guys have created your own identity and branded a podcast.

Speaker 2:          13:23          Yeah, I mean it, Dustin could talk a little bit more about that. I bet. But I mean to me like it just seemed like we want to fuel people's passion. That's our, that's our motto. And to do that I feel like we have to be in contact with them on a regular basis and, and, and sometimes people are only buying coffee, you know, once a month. So we, you know, we were thinking how, how can we be a part of these people's lives, uh, on an ongoing basis? And that's where the podcast came in.

Speaker 1:          13:48          Yeah. When, um, when Michael first brought it up, it was, to me, it was a way to give a voice for the company. Um, not only with our employees, so we do employee interviews, but also with all the influencers that we work with. Because we worked with a lot of influencers that now have a voice through the company with the podcast. But on top of that, you know, it gives a little bit more for the customer to be a part of the company and also keep really well informed with the company. There's a clear style, um, to the identity of the company. I mean obviously it's a bold step to call yourself Deathwish coffee. Why would you want to actively drink something that is threatening your life? But that sort of fear behind that. I do. Absolutely.

Speaker 2:          14:33          Um, so the whole thought of the name and the image of the coffee is, I was, you know, when it's coming up with death wish coffee, I was sitting there was that night, so imagine me sitting in a room at night, it's dark out have is this computer screen in front of me and I was in my second floor apartment and pour as broke as a joke. Like I hadn't, it's so boring. And I'm like, I'm like, how, what, what am I, what? I had this product in mind and like, how do I put this on a screen? And I looked down at this can I was, I was drinking a four Loko at the time. All right. That works for local at the time. And I'm like, who is he? I had on it, had a picture of is a mean dog. And my girlfriend and bought me this Cousy when she went away on vacation and I said Deathwish under it.

Speaker 2:          15:27          And I'm like, ah, I mean that's, that's a cool, that's a pretty cool like name I could, I could, I could go with that for a name of this coffee. And I'm like, how am I going to, what would I want to see if I walked into somebody's kitchen? Like, if I saw bad coffee, what would I pick up and look at it and be intrigued by, and I had this image of a poisoned, like a poisoned bottle, like an old school, like poison via, like we'd pick up and be like, what is like, what kind of coffee are you drinking with this poisoned label on it? Uh, and that was the whole concept behind it. And I was like, Deathwish poisoned while this could, this could work. So, you know, I did some, like I wanted to Photoshop and like Photoshop some stuff around. And so like I got the preliminary logo. It's not the logo. It is now. Um, I'm putting in my risk is actually have the logo on my wrists, which it's just not a temporary tents. There are tattoos but um, tattoos of it. Yes, that poisoned logo. That's the whole image I had in mind in my brain at the time. And it,

Speaker 3:          16:22          well, it's fed so much into the larger identity at this point. You guys with the podcasts of really embracing this, and I know you're a big into MMA and you guys have some influencers from that space that in rock and roll and yeah, I mean that whole area of Edgy influencers has just opened up to us. It becomes like a lifestyle brand. And a certain point pretty early on, it became a lifestyle brand. We realized, and I don't think it was the intent, if you look at some of our original ads, it was Leno, a lawyer who can't wake up in the morning. So he like drinks the coffee. But we found out that our number one people that were spreading the word, we're either like, you know, musicians are recovered, addicts who wanted something to kind of sink your teeth into and a brand that really spoke to them. And, and so many people drink coffee. It's a number two commodity in the world behind oil. Um, and we had the igs most badass brand and when we started this thing, there was, when Mike started, there wasn't a world tour on this coffee. Now you can Google. It's weird up here. Say that.

Speaker 3:          17:24          Yeah, you can search on the Internet. You, it's kind of cool, but you can and you see so many different people claiming to have that claim and they have our, you know, uh, one of my favorite stories is we see so many websites that try to like knock us off. And there was one that used our exact html html code and didn't take the bottom off. So it said, why try Deathwish click here and our, and it was, it was also effectively signing people up for your email. And actually we collected email address postures. Once they failed, they had their, our bag with their logo photoshops and top of it. And we would email them and be like, that's our bag. And they're like, no, it's not. It's like, it has our address on it, on the side of it, the bag. And that you still couldn't hear your website? We have Photoshop. Yeah, it was, it was ridiculous. But, um,

Speaker 4:          18:12          it speaking to it being a lifestyle brand, I mean there are people who walk our shirts and our hats and everything like that without actually even trying the coffee. So, and get tattoos and get tattoos. Um, people who've, they've probably tried the coffee at that point though. That's okay.

Speaker 3:          18:26          I'd hope so. You've mentioned tattoo seventh, sorry to cut that off. Were you?

Speaker 4:          18:32          Oh, I mean, yeah. So we have a few of our biggest fans definitely have, um, our logo tattooed on them, which is insane. People crying all the time. They say, Hey, we want to get your logo tattooed. Is that okay? Well that's a big commitment, you know, we're never like, oh just go ahead and do it. It's kind of like pretty sure you want to do this. You know, we do try and kind of talk them down, but it is pretty cool.

Speaker 3:          18:55          You guys just finished the New York City Tattoo? Yes. Yeah. Did anybody, did you watch anybody get a death? Which Tattoo? No. No actually we weren't going. I mean, I mean it's, it's tough. It's a weird term just to temporary. Yeah. I always, we always joke after they get it. Like, Oh, let's talk about actually selling our name. We're going to be something else. When I was in Santa, very early became a lifestyle brand and one of our first marketing campaigns, um, was, you know, what fuels you, you are a field by death. Um, and that kind of to kind of skip forward back to the podcast, which, which started a few months ago. And Jeff is also the cost to that. And he kind of headed that whole project. Um, we found out very early on that it wasn't just, you know, musicians and, and all these people, it was a engineers. It was, you know, comic book artists, nurses, you know, passionate people about what they do for a living room. And there are Olympians

Speaker 5:          19:44          fueled by death isn't just an idea of, you know, what is your coffee and coffee I like, we keep saying as a lifestyle, but fueled by death is every single one of us in this room, every single one of us outside of this room on this planet wants to do something significant before we leave this planet for good. Because death is inevitable. Whether you get hit by a bus in five minutes or you live to be 90 years old. And what's interesting is, is that everybody in the world enjoys figuring that out. Whether it's or hard, you know, journey to get there or it's something that you know you're passionate about and it's very interesting to attack a conversation that way. And that's where the, the idea of this podcast Kinda came back about. And it's interesting to be able to bring it to a business and because we're not sitting there and being like, well, what kind of coffee do you like and why does that fuel you real quick?

Speaker 5:          20:37          What that would get boring. It would get incredibly boring. But I mean, like we've talked to, you know, astronauts and rock stars and, and normal people and like, why are you, what gets you out of bed in the morning? Why do you get out of bed in the morning and what gets you out of bed the next morning? Why? Why are you doing it? Not the coffee. There's, there's something, there's something that you're passionate about. And that conversation is always, will never not be interesting. You know? And that's, and that's kind of what we are all about as a lifestyle brand too. Because what's fun about a coffee company is coffee is a lifestyle. I all of you out there probably have you own way that you drink coffee and it becomes your morning ritual, whether it's just putting it in a drip machine and hitting the brew button or we're going to a gas station or ruined and you know, taking out your, your chemistry set and really making that perfect cup of coffee, like whatever it is that is your path, that your passion for your coffee at that moment. But after you drink your coffee, then your day starts, you know, and then what are you doing with your day? And we want to be a part of your day, not just in that, in that beginning of it, you know,

Speaker 1:          21:40          it's a, it's a, it's a great narrative to hear about the passion, the seeking passion in, in the people who are around you in a part of that lifestyle. And then equating that back to what you went through to actually get this thing up off the ground. Uh, looking back at it now, were there times when you thought, you know what, this isn't worth it, or were there times that you had to like refine that passion and yourself of like, we can make this work? I do want to do it even though it's early on with the, with the coffee shop,

Speaker 2:          22:07          I believe when I started death, wish I was probably only probably one or two months from closing the doors because it was, it was, I just didn't have any money left and I ate them. I had my car repoed and how to sell my house I was living with, I had to move back into, my mom has lived in behind the garage, so I was very close to calling it quits and just, you know, but I am super, I try to be like, I didn't want to be a failure, you know what I mean? That to me, like that word. And it's funny I think back and people, my friends and family, Hey Mike, how's things over to the coffee shop? And every time like, oh, they're going great. Thanks for asking. But deep inside I was just like, I'm crashing and burning here. Oh No.

Speaker 2:          22:47          So yeah. So after that I'm they know, I'm like, oh, I gotta try something. So yeah, the online, once the online sales started to pick up, I'm like holy crap. Like maybe I can keep this thing open a little bit longer. And I'm like, if I had just made like 5,000 bucks a year, that's pretty much all I need to like make things. If I had worked a little longer. So yeah, there was that time where it's almost, I was at the absolute, you know, ready to ready to call it quits. But yeah, we hung on night. I kept going with it and then I was just, am I gonna pay my bills back someday? I guess, you know? And I did. So

Speaker 1:          23:26          you want to speak about something specific, which is, I would like for you guys to talk about the super bowl ad and how that came to pass because I think it's a testament to your activity on social media space and, and how hard you guys work to build that community. And then not actually that community paying you back. Interesting. We the greatest fans,

Speaker 4:          23:46          community customers in the world, hands down like date. When we keep going back to lifestyle, we keep talking about that they made it a lifestyle. You know, they made this brand what it is, they're the reason why we, we got the Superbowl commercial in the first place because it was a, it was, it's a, uh, small business, big game. So basically intuit quickbooks put out a contest for a small business with less than I think 50 employees and about 15,000 businesses actually entered them. They were one of them. Um, and it was a vote based contest. So basically you would ask your community to vote for you, click, click a very simple link. Um, and essentially the contest was very simple. Uh, the person with the most votes would win. Um, so it ended up being narrowed down to I think a few hundred and then, and then 10. And that was insane. I mean, at 15,000, we had no idea. But coming back to the, the failure of conversation that you're having. I think that was the first time where we kind of said if if we don't win this, that would suck. Like it felt like it would be a setback and it was almost are put so much work into it. So much work into it. It felt like it would be the end of the world. And I think that is one of the reasons why we ended up winning,

Speaker 2:          25:01          cause we put 100% of our focus on winning the competition. It sounds silly, but it really brought our art team together like that one driving purpose and everyday we'd start, it would be big. How are we going to get more votes today? How are we going to get more votes today? Yup. And it came down to us and Chubbies and [inaudible] is a five and dime out of Buffalo, New York. Great small little store. They had all of Buffalo, all 6 million people in buffalo behind him voting every day. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          25:27          And they were a brick and mortar shop that would sell. So find a tiny figurines and Chinese you want to win. They were like, we don't want, what

Speaker 3:          25:37          do we do if we went and, and intuit did tell us after, I don't know if I should say this, but they were like, if someone like that one, we would ever do this kindness again because there's no way to quantify that or help that out. But, um, it was, it was insane. You know, the first three months it was six months competition and the first three months where it started with 15,000 and I honestly didn't think you have a chance. We were seven employees at the time. We're going again, some, some juggernauts of companies. I mean, for instance, Chubbies shorts while they have a little less than 50 employees stay at 125 college brand ambassadors spreading the word, which aren't on the books, which I think that's cheating. That's just my opinion. A victim. Um, but one that, those guys are good guys. They're cool.

Speaker 3:          26:16          They're cool. Um, but when, when they said we want the top 10, it became very real. Um, and then it's like, okay, we did a lot of work. I'm going to this point. But we were kind of like still doing our day to day stuff once they're like, you guys are one of 10. And they basically picked, you know, you had to have a community of people voting, but they also picked really good stories. Like one, some of the people we are going against in the top 10 were like, uh, this Harvard business person, uh, this, this awesome, awesome chick was trying to solve world hunger by a, you put your fruit and whatever on this paper. And it would, it would, uh, make it last longer. And it's like, we're just sell coffee. We're going, it's amazing, amazing stories and amazing companies. And all 10 of them were very incredible stories.

Speaker 3:          26:56          So when we actually want it, um, we, you know, it was, it was the first time we came together as a team and it really, team is the most important thing that you can really do anything you want to do. You just have to meet him. Everyone bought in. And that I think we realize that we can accomplish pretty much anything if, if we, I mean it sounds so cliche, but if you put your mind to it and every day I'm like, it would be like, you know, what is, what $7 million worth of heat, what would you do for $7 million? Cause that's essentially what you're getting. You're getting a $7 million commercial. When we were going to be set as a business, if we could just figure out how to win this thing. And uh, it was a lot of pressure and there were months where we didn't have a day off. We're already going to every event like, um, me and Mike would go to a literal, you know, football game and just hand out things like, yeah, we're a coffee company. Both here's, and in Buffalo. And we didn't realize we were going against those guys. But Tana is tailored, had our march, she is the head of our marketing. So she had, okay, let's try this today. Let's try this today. We're, we're not there, we're not winning. And it was insane.

Speaker 4:          27:48          I would say that if we didn't establish customer service as our number one value way before this competition, I don't think we would have won because it wouldn't have resonated with our fans are with our community at all. Um, and they, we have made it a point to involve them with the company the entire time. So I think that kind of set us up. Um, you know, our fans would when contact us and say, Hey, wait, I said a calendar invite on my, on my calendar so that I remember to vote for every day, every single day. Um, I created a separate mailing list, um, opt in for people. You know, we would send one a day and almost no one on subscribe from that list, which is insane. And the open rates and the click rates were incredible. Um, so our community, um, and just placing, placing them on top of our values, I think is the most important thing that we ever did. We never knew it would have actually come back to us. And it's such a great way

Speaker 3:          28:40          being real and genuine also. And one of the things that, you know, Mike and Tana found out early on where they want people want it to see, you know, your faces they have, you're now their favorite coffee brand. Um, and they, we made, you know, our brand very relatable like none of us have experienced in any of the things we have jobs and now, you know, um, most of us didn't graduate from college. We basically googled business. Thanks guys. Yeah, no, but seriously it was literally like we had a Google education. I know you guys probably heard that and it might be one of those weird trigger things like Ugh, but we did do one social media, how do you want an ad campaign and how do you deal do it today. We still do that. And because of that we were able to kind of like, we didn't have a whole 20 years of, of experience and like this is the way it is, where we're going to go. A lot of those dinosaurs fall at the times we are at the time. It's like we literally grew up in this age, in this era, and we figured out how to do everything by just searching it online. And it's an a test like a testament to the power of what you guys do, which is incredible. And

Speaker 1:          29:42          uh, that's kind of where we are, why we are where we are today. And it is a story of a very meteoric rise, a very short time period to go from the brick and mortar basement roasting. You know, coming up with the recipe to where you are now, where it's the line is diversified. Like you said, you're making everything from whole being to like k cups that people come by and just pop in a machine. I want to have you guys speak to somewhere out there, maybe here it's a Googler or maybe it's somebody who's watching the video at home that has their thing, their passion, and they want it, they want a similar kind of experience. What would you tell them? How would you advise them to, to get involved in that too? Maybe not mimic what you guys have done but at least be on that path.

Speaker 2:          30:28          Yeah, I mean just go for it. And when you feel like you're getting uncomfortable and just push a little further because I feel like, you know, thinking back that point in my life, I almost quit. I was that close to success. You know what I mean? I was that close and I did just push a little bit further. So whenever you're doing or if you have a passion, go for it. And right when you get to that point we were about to quit is it'd be like, actually no, I'm going to push myself, you know, two for there. And I think that if everyone did that, which is a little bit more persistent, like the things you can accomplish are amazing.

Speaker 1:          31:05          Do you guys agree? I mean the podcast creators who are here, you guys just started doing it, right? Yeah. I ain't know where. And you guys have now grown to a fairly decent presence,

Speaker 5:          31:17          GL and baby cas, just 30 episodes out right now. But I mean, yeah, it's one thing I say about this company and this really works towards any kind of anything, anything you're passionate about is that, you know, this company Deathwish coffee is, I always equate it to a living, breathing organism. It's something that learns every day. It's not just coffee, it's not just the brand. It's, it's what we're trying to achieve, what we're trying to do and anything, whether it's the video game you like or, or you know, the hobby that you're creating. You know, when your workshop at home or the job that you have to go to day in and day out, there's always another journey. There's always another path you can take to get to the goal. The goal is just there, but that's never the finish line. There's never a finish line.

Speaker 5:          32:03          And we talk about that a lot on the podcast. In fact, one of the influencers of the company said it the best and we quote him probably every single time. It doesn't knows who I'm going to say. Yeah, you did. Yeah. Naked and afraid. Um, he said it the best. You said you either win or you learn. There is no losing, there's never losing. And, and there's, and when you win there's more to go. You know, and that's, that's a testament to what we do. But it's a testament to what you all do, what anybody can do. And I think that's, I think that's powerful. And just to speak on what, what Michael brought up, Jeff and I were podcasting before we started

Speaker 1:          32:40          podcasting for the company. We had our own little mini podcast, but we were kind of hitting the end of the road there where it was like, is this done? Are we done with this? And we decided we were going to hang on to it. And then that's when Mike was like, well, why don't you do it for the company? And it was like, yeah, let's do it. Let's get it together. Now we have a vision. We, you know, we have a focus and we now, it's been great. It's been amazing. It's been an amazing trip and it's been very short so far

Speaker 5:          33:07          and we're not even, we're not even started, you know, I mean, we started out doing the idea of the, hey, let's have a weekly podcast where people can learn about the company, but we can also, you know, ask those questions to influencers and, and interesting people and the employees as well. But now we're adding video and we're adding live video. We're doing Facebook lives and we're doing, um, as we do it and live, I'm learning how to do TV tricks as we're going live. So I'm on camera talking to you and also putting camera two on as it's happening with other graphics and I'm failing, but I'm doing better at it. Yeah. So I mean like there's always new ideas. There's always new ways to like not even just, it's not improving something, it's just going farther, going that extra step, you know, like it's, it's awesome and it's always going to be

Speaker 1:          33:58          tough when you're breaking ground. I mean, we're doing things that no other co, especially coffee companies are doing. No other coffee companies are making a podcast like we're doing it or you know, making comic books like we do. Um, but when you break ground, nobody's been there before. You can't just Google it, you know, how do I start a podcast and make it a live show on Facebook live? You're not going to get an answer. So it's, it's just a nature of the beast of breaking ground. You're going to have to figure out stuff that nobody's figured out yet, but that's where the success comes from.

Speaker 4:          34:31          Gone back to Mike's Story. I think this is really important. Um, like mentioned pushing past your, um, uncomfortable point. I'm making a list of your worst case scenario. I know that's what Mike definitely did and I'm weighing whether or not those things are worse than failing business wise. Um, I know Mike made a list of best and worst case scenario and all of them ended up happening, um, mom's place, et Cetera, et cetera. Um, but you do kind of have to push past that a little bit. So I do think going back to your original question, make a list of the worst things that could possibly happen. And if you're okay with those things happening at the expense of creating an amazing business and just, just try it out, we'll definitely work. But at least you'll know, you'll know what's to come. I mean, worst case scenario is not doing it at all. Right. That's true.

Speaker 3:          35:19          Part of the, uh, what we kind of omitted from this, this kind of rags to riches story is Mike had a career. He had his masters in accounting. He wasn't accounted for. The state worked for the state had seen all these people that do this thing where they show up everyday to work and they're just like, yeah, no one's really happy. No one's, there's nothing really driving them. They're just like kind of, you know, or robotic. They just get up and they drink their coffee. Uh, and then they go to work and they do their thing. They go home and they go to bed and he's like, you know, I hate this. I want to do something I like. And I liked being in coffee shops. I don't know much about coffee, but I can figure it out. And then, you know, a lot of us were at crossroads in life and we kind of joined the team and I would say that the most important thing is just never settling.

Speaker 3:          36:00          Um, I know that like, so he, he had a career, he didn't like it and just try something else. And it took him, you know, took five or six years before everyone told him. It was like the worst thing were sitting. He was gonna make. Um, I personally, and I dropped out of community college three times. I was a banker. I had the whole career in banking when I was in my early twenties. I hated it. Um, I quit my, uh, family and friends saw me. It was the worst decision. I moved back to upstate New York and I ended up basically homeless for a while. His couch couch. I would be spent a lot of time with Matt and his beautiful wife. And it was, it was a very, very dark time, but I found Deathwish and it's just seizing opportunity. And now tell has got similar stories unless I worked for a teen vogue I think for a little while she still does and we've all done things. Who for a kitchen you worked for a kitchen. Like it was, you know, a lot of different times where we just weren't happy with our current situation and a lot of people settle. And I think that's the biggest mistake you can make it just dealing with it because you think that's all you got and just looking for opportunities and and uh, and when they're there, you know, doors will open. You just have to know to walk through them.

Speaker 1:          37:06          Hmm. Very good. Very good. I do want to leave plenty of time for you guys to ask questions as well. There are microphones in the aisles so I encourage you to, to make your way to the microphone. So with your questions prepared while people are getting ready, I want you guys to go down the line. I don't want you to tell me how you take your coffee.

Speaker 3:          37:23          Yes. I take my coffee out of a Chemex, typically black, no sugar, no cream, strong as you can make it,

Speaker 1:          37:30          but I only drink it in the morning. I get a little weirder with it. I uh, I make something called death proof coffee, which is mixed with butter, MCT oil, blended. Um, I stick a few other things in there. Um, but yeah, that's, that's my morning ritual. One Cup in the morning. I'm good to go all day. Typically. I mean actually came in as like a coffee connoisseur and it was such a brat. I still loved the third wave coffee, but um, typically black, but you'll, you'll catch me going to the Keurig a lot more than it. So here I am.

Speaker 3:          38:04          I have, uh, two different, uh, kinds where it's like I have my hangover on Sunday where just like really just terrible diner coffee with a bunch of cream and sugar. Um, I've also figured out through this job, I didn't know much about coffee. We see, use it as a literal, a utility to get you through your day. A lot of people will drink an energy drink or something like that. And they would always be like, dude, there's more caffeine in coffee than there is in that. You don't need that. It's terrible for you. Um, so I usually have three cups, uh, between eight and 11. Um, and it, it'll me to where the till about three where I started that, that a crash and then I'll have one more cup cause I allows me to go home and get stuff done afterward. So I used to be cream and sugar all the time and then I got really lazy in college.

Speaker 3:          38:47          So it's black and it's a lot. I drink probably five or six cups a day. My desk is directly next to all of our coffee machines and I'm bouncing off the walls by five and he never shuts up. He never shuts up. And he started having panic attacks. So he's had a contact person, that dino video where it's like a fresh pot. It's like his wife was like, are you all right? And what happened? We know that it has an occupational hazard when you work with top. Yeah. It's just, it's just how it works, especially when you don't pay for it. Where we work and we have really strong coffee. And then we started snakes. And one of the things I do want to say real quick is we always look for alternative methods. And we just released a nitro cold brew, which is very concentrated Deathwish coffee. And Jeff would mean that home and have a panic attack and not know why. And it's because he would have one of those too late in the afternoon. Something. Yeah. How about you?

Speaker 6:          39:33          Um, I wake up very, very early, so I start with a chemics and I put a little bit of almond milk in it and then I get to work and I make one the second I get to work in a French press typically. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          39:45          I feel like we haven't heard a lot about the coffee itself. Yeah. So I'm very curious about things like sourcing, roasting, how you blend it, where are you? Uh, and also like, I guess most importantly, it gets very unusual to have a good, like higher end coffee be me at, I've ever Boosta. And what it's like, you know, using Matt rather than Arabica, which every other single copy I'm more of uses,

Speaker 2:          40:05          we'll use a rabbit goes well. Okay. Um, I think our, I think Mike's Mike. Yeah. I mean, our roasters is not here today. That's probably why we haven't talked about it, but he told you we'd have it. It's in a, it's an Indian Peruvian blend. Um, so we get the reboost it means from India. They're organic and fair trade. We're actually one of the few companies out there that, that have, uh, an or, or an organic source for reboost the emotional boost. Do you find? Um, it doesn't have the, uh, the Usda organic certification on it, but we have a very good, uh, supplier. We work with importers and actually in New York here and New Jersey, um, and on the west coast, and they're able to source that for us. Um, the Peruvian is also organic fair trade. Our coffee is a blended post rose, so we don't blend the beans and then roast them.

Speaker 2:          40:53          We roast them separately. So you'll see if you actually opened a bag, you'll see two different shades in there because we found that if you, if you blended post roast, um, the flavor, you'll get a more a fuller flavor. Uh, we use Loring roasters. It's almost like a giant popcorn popper. I like to say, ah, there's no direct flame on the beans ever. So there's no scorching. If you crack or beans open, they're roasted a uniformly straight through. Um, it's the most efficient roaster on the market right now because it circulates the hot air. So we don't waste a lot of gas and there's an not a lot of exhaust either. It also make, it also provides the benefit of us not having to have an afterburner, which a lot of companies will have, which will reduce the environmental impact. So it's the most environmental friendly roaster. We have two of those. We have a 35 kilos in a 70 kilo, uh, at this time.

Speaker 4:          41:54          I want to speak a little bit on specialty coffee and reboost a little bit. Definitely when we first entered the coffee industry reboost it was not highly regarded. I wouldn't say it's highly regarded, but um, there are the NCAA, which is the specialty Coffee Association of America. They actually have set up something at all of their events to compete with rebel or booster. And, um, that's something that I'm actually really proud of at this point. It's cool you get to taste for boost against each other. So even though it's not necessarily like the third wave kind of light roast, um, uh, choice, I, it definitely is. It's own beast that people do love and enjoy and I think it's a 60% of coffee enjoyed is a lot of the times mixed with our booster

Speaker 2:          42:42          right now. Yeah. Be especially because there's been a, there's been a problem with coffee rust. Um, and because of this, um, the coffee industry is starting to make hybrid plants with Arabica. Andrea boost it because there will boost is much more, uh, hardy. It can defend against this coffee rust that they were initially thinking it was going to, we don't really raise coffee prices, but because they were able to blend the two plants together, um, it's resistant. So actually a lot of coffee, you're probably getting all that. He thinks Arabica has some has some are booster in it.

Speaker 5:          43:21          There's actually was studies that were just done where a scientist just crack the genome on reboost a coffee and Arabica has been out there for about a year and so both genomes are now completely mappable and that's why we're getting a lot of these hybrid plants, which is very interesting because now we're going to be able to get a new type of being, you know, that he has never even, the world's never seen and the possibilities of coffee are endless again. So it's, it's pretty exciting.

Speaker 6:          43:47          I think a lot of people just, you're here like Oh, single origin Arabica beans. And you just hear that from different people and you think like, oh yeah, that's the best one. Right? Like that's what I thought. I was like, yeah, this is the best. I didn't know. You just don't know until you try it. So I'll be able to just,

Speaker 4:          43:59          the blind taste tests are very funny and especially, I mean, coming from me, I was, I would criticize everyone's way of brewing coffee and I was, you know, I was that person kind of until someone stuck a blind taste test in front of me and then who was a jerk.

Speaker 2:          44:14          All personal preference, personal preference. I tell people that all the time. We try to kind of, we're like the gateway coffee drug. Um, and I think having someone like Taya and you know that that has really been around coffee for a long time, people will buy it because it is, it has a gimmicky approach, right? It's a, it's colon, world's tronics

Speaker 3:          44:31          coffee. People were like, screw that. That's stupid. The third wave coffee people really didn't respect that. Um, but the, the modern person and, and most people don't have that, uh, you know, pallet yet. They don't know what good coffee is. So we have this thing where it's, you know, Mike worked at a coffee shop. He was able to test every kind of coffee he wanted, shrunk coffee, but he also wanted it to taste good. Um, and we charged a premium price for it. It is a premium blend. Um, and we always try to educate. And Alyssa is an amazing writer and she writes a lot of blogs and take on. I started that where we educate our customers who might be Dunkin donuts or Folgers or the Starbucks, whatever's convenient and uh, and we show them the, you know, this is, this is good coffee and here's how you can brew it. Here's Kevin Max, here's French Press, here's alternative ways to enjoy your coffee. And now a lot of our fans that never, ever would have gotten into that have like, you see them like with a whole station set up and there, you know, kettles and they're, and they're doing that. So awesome question. But yeah, we try to blend the two, the two worlds.

Speaker 2:          45:29          Thank you. Thank you. Another question.

Speaker 8:          45:34          You alluded to it earlier when you started selling online, all of a sudden there are a lot of orders coming in coming in and you were falling behind. I was just wondering if you go a little bit further into how you scaled during that, that process in terms of like vendors, sources and also staff. How quickly do that scale up and get you back to where you need it to be?

Speaker 2:          45:51          Yeah, I was, I was very green back then and I was using, I think shipstation and all I was using paypal to, I'd have to, I'd have to print out every single order and basically like I was thrown in the fire, you know what I mean? Throwing the fire when, when good morning America happened, where we had to produce thousands of pounds of orders all at once and I didn't know how to do it. And that was, I was operating at a level where I could probably do maybe 50 pounds a day comfortably. Um, so yeah. How quickly did that happen? Two months. Two months. Um, you know, we started working with shipstation and we were both printing owners after that, you know, we bought another computer, so it wasn't just one guy like printing out the orders. I was, Kane came on probably three weeks into it, I think all the time. They came along a little bit afterwards. Um, and there was five of us,

Speaker 3:          46:55          five and at the time, um, when this was 2013 just guys, just give you some, some references of time. Uh, Mike had the idea, 2011, 2012 we started selling 2013 and march of 2013, good morning America happened. Um, and you know, as I said before, like none of us really had jobs. We didn't know if it was going to be a sustainable company. Um, and around June after we got through that whole thing and we realized that the sales were still coming and maybe we're onto something here, um, we spent the next year making sure that what had happened would never happen again. So we had flown up to the roof, but we didn't have a foundation yet. So Mike was like, okay, let's outsource all this stuff that we can't or don't want to do in house. Um, and then let's start slowly after that, started taking it back in.

Speaker 3:          47:41          So we immediately made lists and on paper and like, okay, this is what we're doing now. This is the process right now. How do we either get rid of the process? I have someone else do it or, or how can we do it more efficiently? Um, and so one of the things was, okay, we can outsource to a distribution center. So we went around and it, and Eric, who's not here, um, went around and just interview distribution centers and that was a huge thing. Now we don't have to actually package coffee at that time. I spent anywhere between eight to 12 hours a day, packaging coffee. Um, and then once we figured out how to kind of make it sustainable, we started taking all that stuff back and we're still taking stuff back, uh, to be able to do everything under how, and you know, in house. But, uh, it was a process.

Speaker 4:          48:19          Scaling is probably one of the tougher things that we've done. I mean, Mike was doing our accounting for years. I'm pretty sure he still has his hands in it. So I'm, and I'm the same way with posting on Instagram like I shouldn't be doing anymore, but we're, we're all kind of doing it. Um, hiring a, we did use some temp services in the beginning and we ended up keeping a few of those people on. Um, but yeah, that scaling is impossible. It's not like you can, you know, look that up on the Internet. We're so scaling,

Speaker 3:          48:48          same as being able to attract talent. That's what I was most excited about. It took a long time cause at first we would put like, you know, a Craig's list ad up and like, who, you know, this person, we're looking for this, but we don't have money to pay you. So like, here's a, a small money. But it's like, it might be bigger later. And, uh, I think the most exciting thing for us right now is where, you know, we, we've done multimillions of dollars of sales and, and we're, we're still, you know, growing and growing and growing, um, being able to, to bring on a Dustin who an absolute beast and everything he does and, and like, okay, here's a problem, figure it out. And he's like, so he builds our, you know, our entire warehouse and inventory. And then Jeff, like, you know, so much about, you know, broadcasts and all this, your voice, um, Alyssa, you're a content, you know, writer, can we, you know, where you want to come over here? And went and worked for us and we met able to do that and we're still doing that. Super exciting.

Speaker 6:          49:33          Yeah. It's like working for a small business. Like I'm somebody that went from working in a corporation and then it was very attracted to this, like, what is this small business that seems to be doing really well? Like, what's going on over here? How can I get my hands into that? And I think that as far as scaling with people, as people start to see that and as we have jobs are to opening, people are like, wait, how can I get involved in something that's cool and small and different than what like, you know, working at the state, we're in upstate New York, so you know, that kind of thing.

Speaker 5:          49:59          I don't think we've even touched on this like that at that point. Good Morning America. You said that, you know, it was, it was a team of five and then that blew up and obviously scaling up and like I said, we're still scaling up. We have the largest employee base right now and we're at 25, 2123 and that's the company. So I mean, you know, and doing what we do, it's still how do we, how do we maintain that base but reach that ceiling and not, you know, go, go nuts it. So

Speaker 3:          50:28          it's a, it's a, it's a journey. It really is. I think the coolest thing also is being able to do what, uh, what we, what we're passionate about. Matt when we were having lunch, he alluded to like the 20% time and people being able to have time to do projects they're passionate about. And, and we, you know, we're obviously on a much smaller scale, but we have a lot of things that we, like for instance, Alissa, you might want to talk about the grinded out campaign, our first real marketing campaign where they had these ideas. I'll let you talk a little more.

Speaker 6:          50:52          Yeah. So basically what we would like, we were talking about our fan base. We have a lot of nurses and firefighters and things like that that really use the coffee to get them through the day. So what we decided to do with kind of put together a content campaign where we highlighted those people because we felt like, you know, so many companies are like Highland men who athlete or like highlighting this super famous person. But like who we want to champion is the people that are drinking our coffee. And that might be the nurse that's in the hospital or the EMT or all of those people. So yeah. So basically it was something where, you know, the marketing team, me Taya and our art director Thomas were like, yeah, wouldn't it be really cool to put together some videos of these people and blogs and play lists and all of this kind of stuff. And Mike was like, do it. So it's kind of been able to give us the freedom to just make creative projects and things like that.

Speaker 3:          51:43          We want to just show up. We wanted to showcase the greatest tag line like that you guys came up with is, is we wanted to showcase how our coffee lives. Yeah. You know, and it's not just about whose hands we can flip coffee into. It's about, like we said, you know, it's like you get up every morning and you might have a cup of coffee and then you're going to go do something awesome. Usually, you know, and it's like, okay, let's see you do that awesome thing and why, how is it and why are you doing that? And that's kind of where that whole marketing came to cry it out. Hashtag Hashtag Rhino everyone can boy after. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          52:15          Like, it's, we want to see everybody's grind because like you said, it's, it's how our coffee live. So cool.
