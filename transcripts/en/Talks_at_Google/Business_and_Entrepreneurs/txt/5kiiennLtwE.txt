Speaker 1:          00:06          I'm Daniel g, the boring part is I'm a lawyer at a law firm called Sheridan's. The exciting part is I do football for my living, which is actually quite cool and going back very briefly and to um, literally all the times that I used to go to unfilled, um, as a Liverpool fund with how back in the day, um, as all you guys are, I'm sure some football funds, the things that I always did when I was a six year old and Stellar's a 37 year old do is talk about football all day long if it's in the office or if it's actually after on the whatsapp chat cause he gets rid of knowing on whatsapp as well. Actually if a result is gone good or bad. Um, but ultimately the truth is with the loss of the work that I've done is from a very early age. What I actually wants to do was talk about football and I've been lucky enough and you'll hopefully see the career journey to a degree about why and how I manage to convert myself from um, uh, regulations lawyer, which doesn't sound as sexy to a football lawyer, which sounds a bit sexy, but all it is is a regulations lawyer in football.

Speaker 1:          01:08          Um, and what I wanted to also talk about firstly as a little bit about my journey, but as importantly, um, the type of stuff that I do day to day. Um, and the very nice, um, impact that my book, which has just come out recently has had on that. Now apart from my mum being very excited about the book being published, um, it's been, it's thankfully been quite well received so far. And what I want to try and talk about in a little bit of detail or some of the sort of myths that I try and dispel in the book. Usually the first thing that most of my friends and even my family still ask me is actually what do you do as a football lawyer? So what is it that you do that pays the bills? That's cool enough to say that you're a football lawyer and I'm working the football industry doing so.

Speaker 1:          01:55          Um, very briefly it is as follows, on a day to day basis, I tend to work with players and agents. So that is what I do. Um, that tends traditionally to be behind a computer, but very often is on what's up, um, is on my phone is on voice messages that come to me sometimes at four o'clock in the morning. So I'll give you one just brief example of what happened to me the day before transfer deadline day. So Wednesday evening, I won't obviously disclosed con confidential stuff, but just to give you a flavor of what tends to happen very often is a message will come to me from a client that may be a club or a player, an agent. Usually it's an agent or a club saying, um, right this, this is happening, a deals happening on this particular day. We need just to have a look quick look through the documents is always what they say.

Speaker 1:          02:43          And um, that happened actually at 1:45 AM on Thursday morning, uh, done. There's a deal that's happening. You need to go on a train somewhere. You need to get to the meeting for lunchtime, try and conclude the deal in the afternoon and then hopefully everything we'd done before, um, deadline day concludes, um, on that type of stuff happens very regularly. The other cool element that happens quite regularly is when I, um, when I tend to know information that nobody else knows, which obviously is very cool, but I need to be extremely careful about telling anybody this, especially because my family are the biggest Blubba miles of all time as well. And it happens because I did a Liverpool transfer over the summer. I knew a lot of cool stuff that was going on and couldn't tell anybody. I'm the brilliant thing about it also was it was that him, he was asking me about particular deals that were going on.

Speaker 1:          03:41          I couldn't even, I couldn't even deny the existence of what was going on. So for about a week and a half, I couldn't even reply to him. So he thought I was just being annoying, not replying to the General um, uh, rumor mill that was going on, Joanie. But it was actually because one of the players that I was working with was going to be signing a deal with Liverpool and I couldn't even tell my dad obviously, which is very important because he obviously wants to know the, the Gos and what's going on generally. But needless to say, as soon as the deal happened, I could then tell my dad's and my rest of my family who had no idea what was going on. But I still couldn't tell them anything interesting about what happened in the deal. Cause obviously it's confidential too. So the, the type of stuff that I tend to do is unfortunately and the glamorous sizes, great.

Speaker 1:          04:24          You're working with so many fantastic players with great clubs, they're spending lots of money. It is without doubt the most terribly stressful hours of my life on a regular basis. When the window is cropping up or finishing or concluding because you, you are managing risk on one sense you want to make sure that the deal completes because you don't want to be at blame if it's anything to do with you. You are still trying to communicate quite difficult legal concepts to your clients to explain what the risk is of particular things happening. And at the same time also, um, you're trying to make sure that um, uh, you are being proactive. You're thinking about solutions and things. Generally I'm, I'll going to plan and that you want to look unruffled and looking and ruffled and feeling unruffled are two quite different things at times. So that's just a very brief way of background as to what I actually do day to day.

Speaker 1:          05:17          So about meat. We've had the intro, this is where it all began, is the truth. So, uh, my seat was just above the director's box about there. And as you can imagine, there's this big pole that got in the way of the goal basically, which is a problem. So me and my bro had to, uh, ultimate games have to swap seats. So one of us could see the main goal and one of us couldn't for a particular game, which worked out well. Now this is the old stadium, so it's now come to leave the stadium. So it's, it's slightly better. How did I get involved in football? So very briefly, what happened in law school at university was the, um, I asked, my tutor lets you off the cuff, can I write about the Bozeman ruling? And the Bozeman ruling was John, what Bozeman back in the day in 1990, um, wasn't allowed to transfer to a new club after the end of his contract, after it even expired.

Speaker 1:          06:13          And that started a very big landmark case, which five years later actually resulted in what's called the free movement of players across Europe, which meant that after a player's contract had finished, they could move on a free transfer and the selling club couldn't, didn't have to demand it and couldn't demand the transfer fee. So I thought, what a brilliant thing to possibly in third year uni write about, which was the bosom and ruling the transfer system changing and how things would work. And they let me write about it, which is even better after that, I actually just tried to persuade my dad's, um, for me to spend an extra year at uni, which he was happy for me to do if I did something interesting. I did a, a master's in football broadcasting rights. It didn't sound as interesting because actually underpinning it was competition law, which obviously is not quite as sexy as football law.

Speaker 1:          07:00          Uh, but at the same time meant that I could spend best part of about nine or 10 months writing about how broadcasting rights are sold across Europe, which is cool. And it meant that I could go out to the real world for one more year before I had to stop working. As a result of that. Um, master's degree had little bit spare time at the end of the A, which actually meant that my tutor said to me instead of actually just slacking off, why don't you write in a couple of law journals about the things that you've written about? Great. Okay, I'll do that. Didn't think anything would happen, but in a fantastic way. They money, they were happy to publish something about the football industry, which was broadcasting rights and about club ownership. The entertainment law review at the time published those two articles and a few in a few months spells.

Speaker 1:          07:45          But what's actually realized afterwards that as, as well as it was great for my ego. Fantastic. Getting the entertainment sports journal. Um, great to have the publicity. Fantastic to show a few people and have it on my CV. The truth was a domain set battle against entertainment law review. Maybe only about eight people read it is the truth. And you'll soon find out from a lot of the talks or rather a little bit the talk that I give them a little bit of time is what I actually realized. As much as it was really good for the ego because no one was reading it, I actually needed it to improve, increase my profile to a degree. And the way that I actually did that, I've met my wife Holly, uh, in 2007 and quite click quickly. Um, uh, we talked about all the stuff that I could do in my job and wants to do my job.

Speaker 1:          08:30          She actually then said to me, well, hold on a second, why are you writing five or 6,000 words for an entertainment law journal when you could be writing 500 words on your own blog, free. The antibody could be able to then access and read accordingly and actually thought, you know, it's actually a pretty good idea. Um, and so what I ended up doing was, um, not necessarily not writing in law journals overall, but ultimately deciding to start my own website, which has Daniel G. Dot. Com and then, um, effectively start writing small pieces about trying to demystify the football industry to a degree. Even though actually at the time I wasn't doing a huge amount of work in football, I was doing small bets that there is hopefully increasing and the type of work I was doing, but I wasn't doing huge amounts of that time. And it came, actually, it's a very fruitful is the wrong word, but a really interesting time in the football industry.

Speaker 1:          09:24          There was financial fat play, which I'll talk about in some detail. There was third party ownership, which is a big thing at the time. Luis Suarez came to the country. Um, and obviously he had a lot of um, issues with racism, with biting, with suspensions. John Terry Marta came up as well. Um, so I, Nicolas Anelka happened at the same time. So what, what was actually happening, which is quite cool as well. There were lots of cases and lots of issues that the public, the wide fund funds really wants to know about. And what I had a little bit more time before kids and marriage was to be able to read these cases, try and explain what they meant for the average fund. Um, and try and get beyond the Louis Suarez is a racist or um, uh, it's a three much bond for fouling somebody or actually if you look at the detail of a particular case, it means that or it means this.

Speaker 1:          10:20          And what I developed, um, which was great was quite a strong follower base on Twitter as well, which was a great amplifier of my blogs. Um, to be able to then put forward, easily accessible, easily digestible five, six, 700 word blogs that people are interested in. And then what happened is his role to that was that journalists, um, sky sports or the types of broadcast media within interested in having me on their shows really, which is, which is great. Um, and that in itself then drove the profile that I was able to drive for myself and my firm was able then to um, refine my message that I wants to get across to people. And in turn led me then to that, which was from blog to book. So I used to give a lot of comments and commentary to people in the football industry.

Speaker 1:          11:12          Someone I'm a journalist says, why don't you think about writing a book on the topic? And I said, oh, great idea. I don't think anyone will actually think can be interested in it. He introduced me to an agent's David Luxton and who is bizarrely my agents, which is quite strange to say, but nice as well. Um, and he is an effect. The miracle worker that got my proposal that I put to him out to five or six different publishers. Um, there's quite a long process in that till or actually get the all clear to actually then get the deal and to write the book. And then more or less three years later from starting to get the proposal to finishing the book, we are there with, um, with done deal. So, um, that is the book that came out a few weeks ago that, um, uh, that so far has done really well.

Speaker 1:          11:59          You know, I don't know how many copies actually mum has bought in order to actually skew the, uh, the Amazon algorithm accordingly. But in any event, um, uh, everyone's happy at the moment. And then g household, which is, which is nice to the extent that when I told my daughters actually that I had a book being published, my oldest one is, he is six and my youngest one live, he is three and a half. I told you I was writing a book. I'm the teacher then at the next, uh, uh, a teacher's meeting and came in and said, oh, it was fantastic. That, um, you know, you've written a, that you're involved in the book industry. Um, I didn't realize that you were a librarian because Izzy had told her that I'd become a librarian because I'd written, uh, written a book. So that's my new new pastime as well as being an author and a lawyer.

Speaker 1:          12:42          So, um, book out, um, uh, and what I wants to share with everybody for the next 15, 20 minutes, hopefully if this works all right is just a few insights into the world of football, which I see on a daily basis and what is covered and uncovered in the book, but just talking about particular things. So you'll see at the top transfer fees, shirt, sales agents, book deal, so boots, deals, appearances and ImageRight some of the more, um, interesting elements that I think and hope will be of value. And please feel free to ask questions and to delve into some of the things I say. I think we're going to keep the questions if possible to the end, but just hold your questions because I'm always very keen on audience participation. So the most you're able to ask, um, the batter I'm looking at, Tom, please be careful about the questions because if you probably know as much as me about some football stuff, so don't show me up too much, please.

Speaker 1:          13:39          Okay. Number one, a 35 million pound transfer, uh, actually isn't a 35 million pound transfer. Now, I know it sounds slightly counter intuitive, but I promise I'll try and explain myself. So when you look at the back page of a story and the back page of a newspaper, you'll see player moves for 35 million pounds. Uh, and um, uh, and that's the, a fee basically that the club has paid for that player. Yes, that is the case. But what I want to drill down to is actually the liability that the players as well rather than the clubs the buying club has to incur for that player. Now, if a joke's talking about just the transfer fee for a second, the transfer fee is effectively the amounts that's the buying club pays to the sailing club. The buying club has obvious, but what isn't usually as obvious is actually how that is structured.

Speaker 1:          14:30          So in most deals that I see and I've come across, what actually happens is there's what's called a fixed and a contingent elements to a transfer fee. The fixed bit being paid regardless of anything over a particular period of time, usually first, second and third anniversaries of the transfer and the contingent a certain bonuses or met certain conditions are met, which mean bonuses are paid. So if I give the 35 million pounds example, it may be, for example, I'll try and do the math right. That 50 million pounds is paid upfront at the time of the transfer. And then maybe on the first anniversary, 5 million pounds is paid. Maybe on the second anniversary of the transfer, another 5 million pounds is paid. So that takes it to 25 million pounds. It may be that for the next 10 million, in order to be paid, the buying club has to win. The Champions League or the buying club has to uh, win the Premiere League, for example. And if those performance measures aren't hit, then that's extra 10 million will never be paid.

Speaker 1:          15:31          It actually gets a little bit more complicated than that because usually what has to happen is as well as the club winning those trophies, the player has to appear in a certain amount of those games. I, he has to contribute to that season's worth of success. Now that's the first element. So 35 million pounds doesn't usually mean 35 million pounds. It actually can only my Tony mean 25 million pounds on certain contingencies as a result. The other element, which is not factored into any of that, is the play's wages. Now obviously the players wages are usually the biggest, um, liability over the length of the deal. If a player signs a five year deal, uh, let's say for 200, 200,000 pounds a week, that could od over five years. I to try and do the calculations, possibly 50 million pounds worth of liability over and above the transfer fee.

Speaker 1:          16:22          That might only be 25 million. So the point is, when you see the headline at the back page of the newspaper saying 35 million pound transfer, think actually the first thing is you might not actually make, it might not be a 35 million pound transfer, but actually the main liability is actually the play's wages. So 35 million pound transfer may actually be if everything is included over a hundred million pounds worth of liability that's taken into account. And the other thing that needs to be taken into account is the agent's fee. But we'll talk about that in just a second as well. So myth number one, 35 million pound transfer isn't usually a 35 million pound transfer. It's a lot less, but also a lot more. Number two, I see this quite a lot as well. I feel I'm spending more time on this side of the room then this side of the room, sorry, I'll try this. Um, is this follows without fail, pog Ba Latin, um,

Speaker 1:          17:22          Mannette, Liverpool, Salah, whoever else it may be. Every time a big transfer happens, the first thing that you will always see back in back in the day is, uh, the clubs will recruit most of the transfer fee from the, from the shirt sales that they will then they will then make as a result of the, um, uh, as a result of the transfer. I can, I can't say categorically that this absolutely never ever happens, but I absolutely doubt that it ever happens for the following reason. So try and give an example, and this is only from public information because Manchester United for example, of floats in the u s so they have to provide certain information to investors on a quarterly basis. Anyway, it's reported to that. Edward would states in some of those courses, the reports and what is published, the Manchester United makes 75 million pounds a year from Adidas apparel deal.

Speaker 1:          18:19          It makes 75 million pounds a year. That decreases if they don't get to the Champions League over a particular period of seasons. But on the whole 75 million a year, and that's a 10, I think it's a 10 year deal. So, um, almost coming up to a billion pounds for a 10 year deal, 750 million pounds over 10 years. Now, what usually happens in these very, very big shirts deals is effectively those apparel companies are paying a very big advance for the right to be able to then exploit the brand and to be able to sell those shirts. Um, this isn't the Q and a part, but does anybody think that Manchester United or help? So just very quickly, how many shirts do you think Manchester United sell on a yearly basis? Just very quickly shout outs and hundred thousand higher. I'm doing a Bruce Force, I think 15 million shirts. That's quite a difference.

Speaker 1:          19:24          But it is, well that's another big question. Fake or real shirts is that you can put, let's just say authentic shirts retailing for over 50 pounds. Uh, shirts, 5 million. Okay. So the last figures where I'm from a season and a half ago, that Manchester United on a yearly basis sold 2.9 million shirts or rather rd does showed or whoever the manufacturer was 2.9 million shirts. I'm not sure if that's more than a lot of people think or less than other people think. I get varying degrees of, I'm surprised either way. The point being that usually what will happen and those type of agreements is there will be this advanced, this is paid every year, but after that there may not be anything more paid as a result to the club by way of amounts. Usually there will be performance related amounts, but that only kicks in after a certain amount of shirts.

Speaker 1:          20:21          Sales are made on a yearly basis, so it may well be, and I don't know that I did. US Don't pay anything more to Manchester United per year over the 75 million pounds mark that they do. I want to say pay what I mean his share in the revenue, but let's say for example that Manchester United and it does share some revenue after they hit 2 million shirts, sales a and usually that share that royalty, whatever you want to call it, is actually probably only 10 or 20% of the overall additional amount. So let's just, without wanting to confuse anyone in too much details, say that actually Manchester United for every shirt sold over 2 million shirts, maybe get 10 pounds per shirt. So you don't need to meet to do the math very quickly for you to work out that one of the biggest clubs in the world are not making huge amounts of money from shirt sales over and above the amounts that they're getting from their apparel manufacturer straight away.

Speaker 1:          21:22          Now the other question to also add into the mix as well on that is, um, and it's something that no one's really done too much empirical evidence then is would an additional or marginal, um, by a marginal fund, by an additional shirt with the new player's name on, or were they already going to buy that shirt with an existing players name on which also fits into the narrative, which is it doesn't mean that an absolutely new fun is going to be buying an absolutely new players shirt. It may be that they'll buy that shirt, but we're going to buy it anyway regardless of which the player was going to be. So second meth hopefully dispelled in a little bit of detail, which is very rarely, whenever you read a headline of shirt sales, we'll make fortunes for the club. Usually they won't.

Speaker 2:          22:13          Okay.

Speaker 1:          22:14          Sorry. It's a little bit smaller, but you can have to strain to be able to read it. Um, I know the, the question of agents is always quite a topical issue generally. Um, the narrative of agents is that they, um, uh, don't do a great job for players or clubs that they take too much money out of the game in terms of commissions and that their approach is wheeler dealer at best. I have a slightly vested interest in as I work with a lot of agents, but the book hopefully you'll see as well if you, if you able to read it gives a slightly different narrative to the usual narrative, which is agents are just bad guys doing bad things all the time and nobody likes them or at all the, the difference with a lot of the very good agencies that are extremely well networked, um, uh, very diligent in what they do work incredibly hard in a very, very insecure industry.

Speaker 1:          23:10          And when I mean insecure industry, I mean devote worked very hard to get very good players on their books and probably at every other window and other agents has trying to poach their player to say, I can get you a better deal or I can get that for you. I can do this for you better. I'm not saying all of a sudden poor agent's doing a terrible job on the bread line, but the vast majority of agents are not earning the huge sums that are reported in the media. Um, the points of what I'm trying to get to here is, is that there is an interesting narrative which works in the media, which is look how much, uh, agents take out of the game and look how much clubs pay agents. And this is the thing that I think a lot of people maybe don't quite grasp in, in, in the same amount of detail that I've been able to be able to work with an industry for some time, is players don't pay their agents.

Speaker 1:          24:00          So I just want that to sink in for a second because before I started in the industry, it seems quite a strange concept to me is like if I'm, if I'm a player and how is my agent and I and how does a move for me to a new club, I thought that I would pay him because my contract is with him. I'll pay you a percentage of my earnings and that's the way that things work generally. But the way that things tend to work at least in the UK and other countries is in order to incentivize the player to move to their club, the club pays the players agents. Does that make sense? Okay. And that has caused controversy because on the whole, that means that funds see their club paying agents and they see the amounts that they pay agents and don't like the amounts that they pay agents and where it can get a little bit tricky for the player.

Speaker 1:          25:00          And I don't want to go into too much tax detail cause it's certainly not the tax talk and I don't want to get involved in that type of stuff as well. But the one thing that actually then becomes quite intro already heard someone's heard too much about taxes as well. Um, the one thing that's important just to stress about that is, is that, um, that is seen as what's called a taxable benefit. The, the club paying the player's agent is what's called a PLF and d benefits. It's like what Mel and medical insurance or a company car would be. So even though the player isn't paying his agent, he has to pay tax on the club Pangas agent. And if that is one of the most important things that I actually see when a transfer happens is that there's been so many times when the player, 18 months on from a transfer, we'll get a big tax bill from HMRC.

Speaker 1:          25:52          And then the, the players say, well hold on a second. Why have I got a tax bill? The club has paid, uh, uh, my, my agent on my behalf. And then if the agent hasn't done a great job, unfortunately the agent says, ah, yeah, but there was still a tax bill to be paid on that. And what usually happens for very savvy agents when a transfer is happening, we see this more and more, and I'm sure you guys will have heard of this, similar to equivalent in the employment contracts and agent will negotiate what's called a gross up close and a gross up clause is morale and a miraculous payment which comes one week before HMRC is tax bell comes along, which means that then the player doesn't feel the money going out of his account because it's more or less going straight to HMRC, which actually is a very clever thing for the agent to do, rarely because otherwise they will.

Speaker 1:          26:45          And I've seen it time and time again, get into an awful lot of trouble with the player when the player has to basically pay half of the agent's fee in tax to the tax authorities at the right time. So they're the type of things that you see day to day, but the point genuinely being is whenever it feels counterintuitive, almost always the player will never pay his agent. And we'll talk about what the thing is in the future that's going on. I think that's, that may there's a possibility that that may change with a new fee for regulations that are being implemented

Speaker 2:          27:19          next.

Speaker 1:          27:21          Brute deals are complicated. Um, okay. So just very briefly and I'm always interested in doing, um, actually I do use the good at Google analytics tool for, um, uh, my website to be able to understand actually, which are my favorite, which are people's favorite blog posts more or less than what I've the most abused from the, the blog that I did on boots deals is by far and away the, the blog that I've had my most of you is on, in my entire history of writing any blogs. And the reason why I think hopefully it's hit an interesting, um, um, uh, an interesting, uh, point is most people think that a boots deal I when a player signs a deal and it may be for goalkeepers with their golden gloves as well for their Shin pads and their boots that all they are paying for is the ability of the player when they go on the pitch to use their boots and Shin pads and maybe have a couple of appearances on some promotional stuff. So you've seen Massey last week Pepsi but he used his idea dust boots as I did as shoes for the promotional videos, et cetera. Um, so it means more or less means this, whenever I see a boots deal, if it's with Puma, Adidas, Nike, new balance underarm or whoever else it may be in almost every situation. It doesn't cover just boots. So just a quick Straw poll. Who thinks of boots deal should cover headphones?

Speaker 2:          28:52          Anybody? Yeah, to thank you. You've got a head start there.

Speaker 1:          29:00          The, the scope of a boots deal is vast and there's two particular caveats and carve outs that I see quite a lot. One is with most manufacturers, they will try and carve out as much as possible into their scope that they can then exploit for the player to be able to use. So um, headphones is a big one. Um, shampoo and shit. Skincare is another big one. Any types of electrical goods is another one. Um, does anyone think Armani is a competitor of humor

Speaker 1:          29:36          apparently in some boot deals or is it not getting Puma's but the general point is, is that if possible, what a brand is looking to try and do is to create the biggest scope as possible for a player. Not to be able to endorse anything else is the truth because it gives them ultimately a bigger window to be able to put a dress the player up in all of their gear all the time. And also the point worth mentioning as well is just if you've signed a Nike deal, for example, obviously it goes without saying that you shouldn't be going out wearing Adidas trainers. But ultimately the practical reality is is that if you are signing a long term Knightdale, you're probably not going to be able to where I need to add, I did ask for the next five years at all. And if you do, bear in mind, if you do wear any competitor, and especially at direct competitor, it's pretty likely you're deal is over,

Speaker 1:          30:40          almost very likely your deal is over. So that's the one thing on the brand alignment and scope of points. The other bit that's quite interesting I think also on boot deals is the amounts. So you may have, the agent may say to the player, okay fantastic, you're going to earn 500,000 euros a year, um, for your deal. And the player says, great, great news, great to hear. There's one onyx at the back of most boots deal contracts, which always scares me whenever I see it. And the reason why scared it scares me to a degree is it because it is a direct table which relates to the amount of appearances that the player has to make on a yearly or seasonal basis. So what usually happens is the table, if he's an international player, which the big players are obviously who are getting the bigger money, it will say you have to perform all appear in 80% of your club team matches and you have to appear in 70% of your international club matches and if you don't the retainer, which is the overall amount reduces by 40% and sometimes bigger depending on depends on how you want to negotiate that. So one of the important elements is for two things, one to try and negotiate hard hard on those points, but secondly to make sure the players aware of that point. Now there's another question all of that which is, and I'll talk about it in the next slide to a second, but I want to just briefly mention it here and this is obviously where lawyers get involved a lot more. What do you think the definition of an appearance is?

Speaker 1:          32:19          Exactly. I'm not. All of that is exactly right. Is it appearing in the match day squad? Is it being on the pitch? Is it starting on the pitch? Is that ending on the pitch? Is it five minutes? Is it 10 minutes? Is it 20, you know, that is one of the most important went what I think it might be the next slide which has gone through quite nicely, perfect, seamless. Um, that is one of the most important, um, uh, definitions in a contract that I will tend to deal with because ultimately for a boot deal, if an appearance can simply be 10 minutes in a game, you can obviously imagine that it's very much easier to be able to get to that 70, 80, 90, whatever percent threshold in order to maintain your retainer amount in your boot deal. But most importantly in an employment contract setting, this is very, very, very strategically important for an agent and a player to know about as you can imagine.

Speaker 1:          33:24          But usually for two reasons. The first is when, um, uh, uh, an agent is negotiating his player's employment contracts. There is much more, um, uh, uh, there is much more consideration given to variable pay rather than fixed pay as the husband in previous years. And what I mean is fixed is you will get 50,000 pounds regardless if you play one minute, whether you're not even in the squad. And it doesn't matter whether you play or not, that's the fixed amount. The player always knows that he will get that amount regardless of what he, how he plays or what he does. What a lot of the elite clubs are doing now is trying to reduce the fixed amounts and increase the variable amounts, which is if you play and if you win, you'll get more than uh, if you would have just, uh, um, how'd your 50 grand amount every month, every week, and a little bit extra.

Speaker 1:          34:22          So the incentive effectively is that if you think you're good enough to play an office team, you should take a lower fixed amount and a higher variable amount because we're good enough, which means you're going to appear and you're going to win and therefore you'll be remunerated better than you otherwise would have done. But you can see obviously the point that I'm trying to get her here, which then becomes the points appearance becomes very, very important. As a definition because the bonus element for the employment contracts is appearance fee. We'll give you a bonus now as you can imagine then it's exactly all the points that you said doesn't appearance mean and it usually does and lots of instances, uh, starting a premiere league much, that's what it can sometimes be and that can be caveats throughout. There was a different bonus for starting a premier league much to an Essay Cup, much to a Champions League, much to a League Cup, much to a friendly much.

Speaker 1:          35:17          That's how varied it can be and it can be different when amounts for all of those competitions and sometimes there can be merged together so it's an appearance and when bonus in order to get the bonus. So obviously as you can get to now an appearance and how that is defined is crucial as to whether a player may get the bonus or not. For an agent, he'll want to try and make sure that one minute on that pitch classifies as a bonus, as an appearance. Whereas the club will want to make sure that it's a start in the first team squad for particular game, which means it's harder obviously for the player to do that if he's injured out to for whatever else it may be. The other element of why when it appearance becomes very important is because sometimes in a contract there'll be a ratchet effect.

Speaker 1:          36:04          And what that will be is, is after you've played in 20 games, 40 games, 60 games, 80 games, your salary will go up accordingly as well. So you may be 50,000 pounds that you get is fixed. If you play 20 games for us and appear in 20 games, you will then go up to 60,000 pounds a week and then 870,000 pounds a week if you get to 40 60 80. And again, that's very important for how you define appearance. I've talked about parents who are way too long, but hopefully you can see why that actually becomes quite an important element for players and agents and clubs to understand last bits about dispelling mess a little bit as well. Um, so I've just been, just put the phrase out there which is image rights deals are just another way to avoid tax. I just want to briefly spend we okay for time, um, a few minutes talking about what's an image rights deal is for players and then talking about why it's important in the current, in the current environment.

Speaker 1:          37:05          So if I just try and uh, uh, explained very briefly, traditionally a player will only have one contract with his club. It will be an employment contract that will say you are employed by this club to play football straight forward with all of those clauses and all the things we've talked about previously. Nowadays for a lot of the elite clubs with their elite players, they have a huge raft of partners and partnership agreements and endorsement deals that they can activate across the globe at which are very lucrative contracts. And what clubs are realizing is they are happy to, well not realizing what they want to do is control the activities of their players to a degree so that they can activate those players for the club to be able to then activate its own partnership arrangements over a longterm basis. So do spurs won a hurricane to be able to um, activate a night campaign for Spurs? Yes, they do. To a Liverpool wants most solar to be able to activate a particular campaign for Standard Chartered. Obviously they do within the standard contract, there are default positions where players have to have x amount of appearances. But what is happening more and more with elite clubs is they are entering now into two separate deals with their players. One is the employment contract, but the second is an image rights contract usually with a player's company.

Speaker 2:          38:38          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          38:39          And what happens in this deal is the players company more or less promises to do two things, which is a real significant value to the club. One is, it says for the provision of x amount of money.

Speaker 2:          38:52          Okay.

Speaker 1:          38:53          Uh, we the club want to make sure that you, the players image rights company, make sure that the player appears in x amount of endorsement opportunities and partnership opportunities for the clubs partners. Does that make sense?

Speaker 2:          39:11          Okay.

Speaker 1:          39:11          Guaranteed number. So that means that then the club's commercial teams can go out and sell quite a lot of inventory on the basis of knowing that maybe that top 15 stars will be available and are contractually available to help endorse the club in a club context.

Speaker 2:          39:29          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          39:29          Not so very important to element. The other element, which is a very useful to the club in paying a players image rights company

Speaker 1:          39:39          is that there are a hell of a lot of restrictions that then the club can impose on the player. So just to give you a brief example, so I don't know how many partners Manchester United hough throughout the world. Global partners. There's a lot, I mean I, I'm not sure it's quite 150 I lost count. I think there was upwards of 90. So, for example, and just by way of if it's Manchester United, if it's Chelsea, if it's Liverpool, if it's arsenal, a lot of these clubs have a big roster of commercial partners and what those clubs would ideally want from that players is to ensure that those players cannot contract with a competitor of the club brands, which means that they are effectively clean from any club competitors, which then puts them in a strong position to make sure that their players, I'll never going to endorse competitors of the club's brands and that's quite a valuable commodity to be able to actually um, use as well.

Speaker 1:          40:48          The flip side, which is why we talked about tax is the reason I've said all of that commercial and explanation is because still there are always big headlines about the fact that um, image rights deals are just a way to avoid tax because obviously players, image rights companies are paying corporation tax rather than pay as you go pay as you earn. And national insurance contributions. The point being is that even though that money is coming in and the club under players, image rights company is only paying corporation tax, that money is still in that club's accounts. It has to. If, if the player wants to remove that money, he's either got to pay it through dividends, he's got to pay it through salary to other people through the company. Hover is there still needs to be Tux paid for onshore companies that are using an image right structure. So my point is I'm not the uh, the guide that will always say image rights structures are always totally inadequate. It's just another way to avoid tax. Usually there are very good reasons why clubs will want to enter into image rights agreements with that players. One because it guarantees them appearances and two, it means that they can just restrict the players in promoting competitor club brands, which can be very important. Okay. Almost there. I promise.

Speaker 1:          42:12          What's next? I just wanted to talk, we've talked actually about agents already and get your questions ready. If you have any, any questions as we go, more than happy to answer anything. But lots of people, um, actually since I've released the book of acts, you said, well, what do you think is next for the industry? And, uh, there's a chapter right at the beginning of the book called, um, the football ecosystem where talk about how everything is sort of overlaid together. So, um, you know, where the player's fit in with their clubs, where the club's fit in with the league, where the leaks fits in with broadcasters, where broadcast is fits in with the funds for subscriptions. Where of our international games was about fee for new way for and all of these different ways that um, um, the football world works. And people said, said to me for quite some time and continue to ask me, is the football model sustainable?

Speaker 1:          42:59          I think that's one of the things that lots of people say, you know, football players are being paid huge amounts of sons to be able to played football and for their image to be able to be used. Is that model sustainable in the longer term where we have sky for example, and bt paying five over 5 billion pounds, um, for UK rights. And a whole raft of broadcasters paying upwards of 4 million at 4 billion for the overseas rights for life Premiere League matches. The query is well how come clubs still afford to pay all of these wages and pay these exorbitant transfer fees? Is the bottom going to come out to the market at some point? That's the type of question I get asked quite a lot and the answer at least at the time being, and that's why I just put the broadcasting point that there is, is that so long as there is an appetite for broadcasters to spend large sums of money because they think they can recoup that money by way of subscriptions in different models then at the moment the answer is yes.

Speaker 1:          43:59          But we see, I saw some interesting starts a few weeks ago explaining that sky. Um, uh, in the purchasing of the, the, the rights for Premiere League matches seem to be straining a little bit in removing some of their other contents because they've had to spend so much money on Premiere League matches and live Premiere League matches. And in the same way, whilst the sky has always been the incumbent for live Premiere League matches, Beatty came into the markets to auctions ago effectively because they saw quite significant churn. They saw churn away from their broadband offering into sky broadband because people were already taking a pay TV, Sky Sports and thought that they should bundle sky broadband with their sky sports offering. So in some ways was a lot of commentators said at the time was that bt came into the markets to protect their broadband offering and then in order to be able to then get champions league rights and Premier League rights and then you can see what's happened subsequently, um, bt by e a sky have their own, um, uh, mobile offering as well.

Speaker 1:          45:09          And you have what's called a quad play offering. So you have to quad play players playing out in the UK market for a whole range of consumer goods. Um, pay TV and sky PTV, sorry. And the premier league being a very big part of that overall picture. So the question is, at some point, who knows what will happen is where the subscription start dropping off because of the cord cutting generation. Because people aren't willing to pay 60 70 pounds a month, the sky or bt pay TV subscriptions. The question asked a week ago, Simon Jordan was on um, um, uh, talk sport and he said, why don't the Premiere League just go it alone? Why don't they just go straight to market and offer an Ott offering globally? And I ask people to pay eight, eight to 10 pounds a month to watch every premier league much they want and take away the broadcasters.

Speaker 1:          46:02          I've, I, I wrote a blog about 10 years about that 10 years ago about that exact point. You know, quite a lot of major league baseball do it really well in the states and there's a real interesting offering now that could possibly come to fruition. But the truth is it would take a very brave, whoever the next chief executive of the Premiere League to come in and decide not to take the 9 billion pounds check that is usually on the table for the global distribution of its rights. So if I just end on that note, which is are things changing his death? There's cool things happening in the market right now. There's lots of different broadcasters doing cool things, but ultimately so long as that money funnel continues because funds and subscribers are subscribing to those channels, then that money flow will continue throughout the game and players will probably be paid significant amounts because they are that good and because the clubs can afford it. So on that note, I think I'll probably say thank you for listening and happy to answer any questions.

Speaker 2:          47:05          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          47:12          what's the strangest thing that you've seen in a player's employment contracts with the club? Like a clause or some sort of, um, I haven't seen any would like totally bizarre things that I'm thinking. Oh my gosh, that's just really weird. But there's lots of publicized ones that I've put in the book. Rarely. So, um, if I talk about a few of them, um, and this is just what's being reported in the press really. Um, so Neil Rodnick who was an ex Liverpool play, I'm supposed player back in the day who um, uh, you know, I think could Devonia really played center but because he was quite a big guy, but you know, he scored a great goal. I remember in the [inaudible] nine new game when he went, um, uh, towards the end of his career it's a particular club. Um, the report was that they put a way, a weight clause in his contract that if he went over a certain weight he would be fined or his wages would be reduced by certain limit.

Speaker 1:          48:10          Another clause which, um, I read about, which was Stefan Schwartz, he was a Swedish international player. He moved to Sunderland and apparently there was a clause which said he, Sunderland had read somewhere that one of the things that always wanted to do was to go to space. So Sunday and apparently puts a clause in saying during your time as our club, you are not allowed, you're prohibited from going into space. And there was another one which is from a Liverpool plan, next level plus digging could be on to be, he was a Norwegian International. Um, he, uh, his father was I think an Olympic skier and uh, Liverpool ensured that there was a clause in which he said he couldn't ski during the time that he was Liverpool Fund. All of a player obviously for obvious reasons really. And there is that is quite standard clause that you can't be anything. It hasn't just for the obvious reasons that you probably hurt yourself.

Speaker 3:          48:58          Just quick question about the yeah. The boots stuff that you put up as well. I've got a good friend actually works for one of the big two and d. Um, he was saying about the, one of the biggest challenges he sites we're working with some of the players he looks after five premier league clubs I think, um, is, is their egos and not their personalities. And they all want things for free, even though they own, you know, mega money. So I suppose my question is around expectations. Do you, do you, how do you deal with expectations? Were players and with, with big ego, well not everybody has got big acres and brushing everybody puts, um, yeah. How, how'd you deal with kind of what those expectations were, players and those, you know, big players.

Speaker 1:          49:37          Are you talking about, uh, W in terms of boot gears or just generally?

Speaker 3:          49:40          Just generally? Yeah, I suppose it's quite difficult to manage.

Speaker 1:          49:44          Um, simple truth is that, um, of the players that I have close relationships with and literally it's, it's hilarious and cool as a football fan, they'll just what's up you and say hello and literally I'm giving book recommendations to one player who's interested in like just expanding is expanding his, um, a repertoire of reading at the moment because I've lived through a weight trips and has got lots of time on his hands. Um, but the, the majority of players that I end up having good relationships with, the guys that want to know the detail is the truth. And usually in my experience the players that want to know the detail of the most switched on to understand the way things work. The players that may be don't are the ones that I'd be like just leave it and let the lawyer do it, let the account and do it.

Speaker 1:          50:33          Let the agent do it. However is that, that's absolutely fine too, but usually I don't like to call it pre Madonnas days is actually because maybe they're not as educated as they need as as the team around the need to give them to make sure they understand what they need to be doing on a daily basis to get by is the truth and what I try and do and lots of the time, just to flip it onto the positive is that every time a new player, even if it's a young player especially comes into the office to say hello or helping them with the deal. My Dad was like, look, just give me half an hour with the agents and the player. I just want to talk you through particular things I think are going to be important for the next deal. For the next endorsement deal you're signing.

Speaker 1:          51:10          Think about what you're doing on Twitter or in store or snap or Tinder. Um, literally because you know, everybody has a phone, everybody has a video, everybody wants to catch someone out doing something they shouldn't do, who's famous. That's the truth. Unfortunately, that were living at the moment players 20 years ago. We're in a much in a way and much more privileged position that it can have gas. We'll probably get to wear it a lot more stuff that players can't do now. So that's almost the point, which is I'm trying to just to flip and pivots the narrative, which is get players better educated as to what the needs to be doing so they can make more informed decisions. Always players would do things wrong. That was fallible as as us. Um, we just, I think people are just like a bit of Shard and Freud of where famous person who's earning a lot of money to something stupid. Just wondering how you manage your client's expectations when you're dealing with someone who, so for example, a player that is injury prone and you're going to see that in the boot sponsorship deals and then their appearances, a lot of that is tied to Dapper, you know, their parents is and how you deal with that.

Speaker 1:          52:23          It's a really good one. Um, it depends how you classify injury prone is the truth. Now either you do one of two things as an agent, you can strategize beforehand to say, right, we've got three boot deal offerings on the table. The retainer amount is this amount for this club. So for this particular manufacturer we think an estimate that because over the last three seasons the players played 25 games per season because either injuries or form, whatever it is, we need to try and get to this number with this amount of appearances that we think we can get for the player of the season. So in a way it's a reverse engineering of the, um, the contractual matrix in order to make sure that we, that you can get the player over the line saying this is the amounts that you may have, but you're probably going to own it and decimal because of the amount of games you're going to play.

Speaker 1:          53:13          And ultimately what can sometimes happen, which can help is on the appearance side watch. But it didn't quite touch on if you're savvy enough, what you can actually say to the boot manufacturers to say, we're only going to classify a as particular competitions. Because if you're an elite athletes elite footballer, you're probably less likely to play an FAA cup and League Cup. I'm more likely to playing Champions League and Premier League. So what you would try and do if you're the elite agent elite player act agent acting for elite player, you try and exclude the, the, the cup competitions to try and ensure that if appearance is defined as 80% of those games, you're more likely to be able to hit those benchmarks.

Speaker 2:          53:59          [inaudible].
