Speaker 1:          00:10          Hello, first thing to say is thank you all for coming. I should probably say that the turnout today perhaps either reflects how amazing my book is or the time of year and the fact that everyone's starting to think about productivity at the start of January. So, so welcome for the last, uh, just coming up to 10 years. My life has been about obsessing and thinking about the, the subject of productivity. I mean, it started out because I myself had some big holes in my own productivity and I didn't do things particularly well and I started to really go on a journey of conquering that for myself and then starting to falling into teaching other people about what I learned and, and teaching other people on how they could start to develop their own productivity as well. So I'm going to talk to you about some of the key ideas from my book, how to be a productivity Ninja and hopefully give you a few ideas and spark a few thoughts that you can then take away news practically to make some changes to the way that you work.

Speaker 1:          01:08          So the first thing I want to talk about is the fact that often there's a bit of a fatigue around this whole subject apart from obviously at the very start of January. Um, and the reason for that is that I think a lot of people have been familiar with some of the key ideas and techniques of time management. You've probably been on some kind of time management cause before just by a show of hands who's been on some kind of time management thing. Um, and uh, keep your hand up if everything is now fixed and it's all sorted and you're 100% wonderful in the way that you work. So I think, um, for me, time management is broken, time management is dead. And I think, um, the flip side of that is to start to think much more about the idea of attention management. So rather than thinking about how we manage our, our tie, our time, when you think about attention as being the most precious resource that we have, and how can we get the best out of those times that we have the best attention.

Speaker 1:          01:57          Um, so I'm going to talk to you about nine things that you can do that really help you to make the best of your attention. Have nine different mindsets, nine ways of thinking that will really help you to become a productivity Ninja and really help you to move forward in terms of some of those turning some of those older time management ideas into something a bit more modern and a bit more based in the world that we live in today. Um, so the first one of those is zen like calm. So often when I'm asked to talk about productivity, one of the questions that I ask back is when was the time that you were most productive? So just if you think for a few moments about when was the last time that you really felt yes, I'm really on top of this. This is a moment of key productivity.

Speaker 1:          02:38          Often when people think about that question, the one of the answers that comes up a lot is when I was on a deadline. So you're on this deadline, you've got this thing to do, it's five, it's got to be in at five o'clock. You've got this deadline and everything else in your life and everything else in your brain seems to fall away. And you get into what psychologists refer to as flow. This kind of state of being totally in the moment focused one thing. You're not thinking about what you're going to have for dinner that evening. You're not thinking about emails, you're just totally you in that zone working on whatever that thing is, whether it's a document, whether it's ideas, whether it's a thing that you're doing as a team, but everybody's just kind of focused or you're just really focused on getting this thing delivered and, and that becomes the only thing in your world at that point.

Speaker 1:          03:17          Um, now for me, the problem with that is that deadlines are really expensive. They cost us in terms of stress. We start to love the people kind of getting out of the way of the camera that love it. Um, so at deadline we'll really, uh, you know, it will cost you a lot in terms of stress. If you're constantly in deadlines and you're constantly using deadlines is the thing that gets you over the line with stuff and you're leaving everything to the last minute and letting the deadline push you forward. Then after a while you're going to burn out. Whereas really, what, what is the deadline doing anyway? So what a deadline does is it, it brings you into this state of Zen, like calm. It forces you to say this is the most important thing. I know that nothing else matters. And my contention is you can get to that place of saying this is the most important thing.

Speaker 1:          04:00          Nothing else matters without a deadline. And what you need to do to get to there is much clearer thinking in terms of what's on my plate so that you're really much clearer about your priorities. So I'm gonna talk to you a bit about how to get there, but the idea is to spend as much time as possible in this state of Zen, like calm state of flow. And this state of I'm working on one thing. I really know what I'm doing. I'm really clear and focused on that one thing. This is how a lot of us do spend a lot of time in work, which is that we, our brains are just full of different ideas. Um, does this image look familiar? So we have this whole sense of feeling overloaded and overwhelmed and we have the sense of there's a hundred things we could be doing.

Speaker 1:          04:40          We're not quite sure where to start. Um, David Allen who wrote the book getting things done has this lovely line, which is the mind is for having ideas not for holding them. So the problem is if you've got all these different things going on in your head, then it becomes very difficult to get to this state of zen like calm cause you just totally thinking, oh that email, that thing. You know, your, your, your brain is constantly moving from one thing to another, trying to work out where were the biggest priority might be. Um, in any given moment. Um, it never used to be this complicated. So, um, Peter Drucker talked about this idea of um, uh, knowledge work in the information age. So moving from the industrial agents, the information age and what Peter Drucker was very concerned with was defining knowledge work. Um, you all in this room are knowledge workers and what that means is you add value and you create value out of information.

Speaker 1:          05:24          That wasn't always how we worked. So back in the industrial age, you might have had a job that looks something like this. So there's a cake factory, there's a big conveyor belt and there's cakes coming down the conveyor belt. You've got a big box of cherries and your job is to put one cherry on each cake. So you do that nine to five, you put cherries on cakes, nine to five, you have your break at lunchtime, you have a break in the morning, break in the afternoon, you go home at five o'clock. How many people in that job putting cherries on cakes? Nine to five. We'd be going home of an evening and Thinking, Oh, the cherries today. It just went crazy. All sat there on a Sunday evening. And you're thinking to, I have no idea how it's going to go next week, it's going to be mental.

Speaker 1:          06:01          So it's very easy in, you know, that kind of a job to know exactly what does done look like, what does the end look like, what does success look like? Whereas in knowledge work jobs, it's much more difficult and not as many jobs. It's much more about how we define success, how we define those particular things that that make the difference. And you know, maybe your viewpoint is slightly different from your bosses viewpoint and there's all these competing priorities at the same time. So really one of the hardest things to really acknowledge and to, and, and one of the things we really got to take into account when we're trying to get into this state of zen like calm is this idea that we're similar Tennessee, the boss and the worker all at the same time. So by the way, all of you have to put cherries on cakes.

Speaker 1:          06:40          That is part of what you do. Those, those cherries on cakes are the emails that you send, the meetings that you set up. The things that you deliver, you are all putting shows on cakes. And the trouble is you're also having to decide what time should the shift start today and how fast should the conveyor belt pick be going and all these other questions. And having to think strategically about, you know, what's going on in the, in the wider world is that everyone's thinking about healthy eating. So maybe we should take these cherries and make fruit cocktails with them instead. You know, so we're having to make all these intuitive judgments at the same time as delivering on work. So it was similar tendency of the boss and the workers all at the same time. And really getting into that, that state of sunlight car I'm getting to a state of being able to deliver in a really focused way involves doing that boss thinking first.

Speaker 1:          07:19          Like really getting to grips with and defining what's on my plate so that I can then make the best decisions in that moment and do the best work so slightly, um, sort of different energy to follow ruthlessness to follow on that time. It would be Ruth. So almost like the opposite energy from sunlight car. Um, so the second of my nine coaches, six his ruthlessness and, um, a lot of people, when I put this slide up, they start to conjure up images of like Gordon Gekko in Wall Street or, um, Leonardo Dicaprio in the wolf of Wall Street, kind of, you know, bowling with dwarves and all this kind of stuff. And it's like, so I'm not talking about stuff that is, um, you know, uh, you know, sort of very unkind or, or really aggressive. But we have to really think about ruthlessness in terms of how we define tasks, how we defined what we're working on, and just our own mindsets around all this stuff.

Speaker 1:          08:11          Um, so the first thing is to be really ruthless with yourself. Really start to really think about how many things do I have on my plate? What are the things that really are going to make the most difference and what are the really good things that I should be doing that I'm going to say no to? So, you know, most people are, um, very well able to say no to the stuff that doesn't really matter. It doesn't mean that we don't sometimes spend time doing things that doesn't really matter, but it's, you know, it's sometimes really the trick is saying no to really good stuff as well. Um, so Warren Buffett has a lovely quote, which is the difference between successful people and very successful people is that very successful people say no to almost everything. And for me, you know, this sense of being really tight and defined around your role and what you're working on and saying no to stuff that perhaps sounds like a really good idea.

Speaker 1:          08:59          Um, you know, learning the art is, is really, really important. Um, also just being ruthless with ourselves. So recognizing when we are, um, in that sense of procrastinating. I'm so, you know, who turns on Facebook or whatsapp or Instagram on your phone or on your computer like you do. So getting ruthless with how you manage yourself on that. And I'll talk a little bit more about how to manage, manage attention and, and some of the stuff that we can do and that I'm in a few minutes, but really getting Rufus to put ourselves in that right frame of mind, that right zone for productivity and really starting to, to be strict with ourselves sometimes to get the right kind of work done. Um, and then this one is really key. So I think for me, I mentioned the beginning that time is not your most precious resource.

Speaker 1:          09:45          Attention is your most precious resource. So in the book I talk about these three different modes of attention. So I think we have three modes of attention. The first is proactive attention. This is the two to three hours a day where we have the best energy and the best ability to do our best work. And so when you really start to think about it and, and, and track this stuff and just reflect on your own work, um, every period of time, let's say a couple of weeks, you'll start to notice real kind of trends and sort of peaks and troughs in your energy levels. So there's a time when you're sat at your desk and you feel totally able, totally focused, able to do the really most difficult stuff. So that's proactive attention on the other end of the scale. Um, who's had a time in your day where perhaps you're sort of looking at the screen, you're scrolling up and down on the email inbox or whatever, and you know, it's like the lights are on, but no one's home.

Speaker 1:          10:31          It's like four o'clock in the afternoon and you know, so that's managing time really, while you're in the right place, doing the right thing. But actually you don't have the right level of attention to do really sophisticated work at that point. Um, and there's loads of science behind this too, right? So there's loser science around willpower and willpower is a dwindling resource each day. Um, so it stands to reason that there will be a point in your day where you have the best energy, that proactive attention and also pointing the day we have inactive attention and the bit in the middle is called active attention. So that's just kind of the bit in the middle of where you can do some stuff that you can't do everything. There's certain things that you can do during that time. Another problem is that proactive attention often comes at points in the day where other people want to take our attention away.

Speaker 1:          11:09          Other people want to scramble our attention. And so we have to get really ruthless with how we protect that proactive attention. Um, so if you think about it as being two to three hours a day, um, most of the studies that have been done on this say that that's generally for most people in the morning rather than the afternoon. There are of course exceptions to that. Um, but that morning time where people tend to have that practice of attention is also the time where it's like, okay, so I'm just going to spend this just warming up for the day or like I'm in someone else's meeting or like something else is going on. And so often there are so many forces that can just take the attention away from us from basically scramble our attention. So getting ruthless with protecting those times and knowing when those times are key for you.

Speaker 1:          11:48          Uh, so for example, like personally I have a bit of a policy which is I don't do meetings in the morning and phone calls in the morning. So like my morning is like the heads down, proactive attention time and the afternoon is the more kind of collaborative time. And that's kind of easy for me to say because I control my own diary and I get that there are lots of other factors at play there. But even if it's just looking at one or two hours a day and saying, I'm going to Ruth as you try and protect that time. And that can make a big, big difference. Because in my experience, most of Sydney, most of my best work and what I observe in, in everyone else that they work with is that, that proactive attention that the stuff that you do in those one, two, three hours of the day, that that really makes a difference. Like that's the stuff that you'll get judged for. All the other stuff really is kind of filling in all the kind of emails and conversations and everything else. The stuff that really makes you famous in your job, the stuff that really makes it impacts, tends to happen in those two to three hours a day.

Speaker 1:          12:39          So the third one comes about his weapons savvy. So obviously a Ninja has to have weapons and tools. Um, it's fun to geek out and have, um, uh, you know, lots of, uh, interesting kind of conversations with other productivity geeks about like different apps and all this kind of stuff. But like really we have to be savvy about how we use tools, how we make the best of all the tools that we have. So on the little iPad there, you've got like a few different tools. The tool I use most regularly is called nausea. Nausea is basically a to do list APP, very sophisticated to do list APP. Um, that really allows me to manipulate the data within my to do list. Um, really well. I can look at it by the project view project by project, what am I working on? I can look at it by where am I going to be to do certain things.

Speaker 1:          13:25          I can categorize stuff, I can put date reminders and all that sort of thing. Um, so just like slightly more functionality than a lot of them were basic to do list apps. Um, other ones you'll find that things like to do is remember the milk. Um, really good apps. Most of them have a kind of freemium model as well, so you can get most of what you need from the kind of free version and then you pay a bit more if you want the kind of subscription version. Um, but one of the things I'd recommend is really thinking about having some kind of APP, um, that you're going to use for your to do list. And that then synchronizes with your computer, with your phone, with an Ipad, whatever you're using, um, across those different devices and platforms, but gives you that ability to, to really kind of prioritize and think clearly around the work that you're doing.

Speaker 1:          14:04          Um, so thinking about if you're going to use any apps at all, think about what you're gonna use for what I called the second brain. So your own brain is not particularly great at holding onto and remembering all that different data. So having a second brain where you put all that stuff out, you know, out on the page as it were, like inside the APP, and you start to see projects and actions and start to be able to kind of move those things around and prioritize these things. And that's really the kind of best use of technology that you can have. There's loads of other really useful apps that I use, but for me, like getting really honed around a really good second brain, a kind of app for me, makes the biggest difference. Um, I want to just like for a few minutes just about email.

Speaker 1:          14:41          Um, so, um, who loves their email inbox? Just suppose show of hands. So a couple of hands. Uh, so for me email, it's one of those things that has just sort of pervaded work over the last few years. Um, I don't need to tell you that you get a lot of emails and the email is annoying. That's kind of a given. Um, so I've over the last few years been a big proponent of a, a thing called inbox zero. The idea of getting your inbox down to zero. Um, and I think that's often misunderstood thing. I think, um, the idea of inbox zero, um, is not that you have your inbox at zero all the time and that like you spend every minute of the day when one email comes in, you have to kind of bat it away and like leave it a zero. For me, it's more of a mindset that says email is just the medium that we communicate through.

Speaker 1:          15:27          Maybe it's not actually where most of the best work gets done. So inbox zero is really a way of kind of hacking that problem in order that you can get outside of the inbox as much as possible. The real work for me happens outside of the email inbox. Um, even when you're communicating via email, you know, really what's the stuff that's really making a difference. It's the impact of those two people having conversations. And if you had that same conversation face to face or had that constant, the same conversation over the phone, you'd still get to the same results. So email is always just the medium. Um, some people get very bogged down in the idea of like email is their job and email is the one thing they need to be doing. And for me actually like, you know, amazing things happen when you start to get outside of your email inbox.

Speaker 1:          16:05          Um, just a very quick overview. There's a whole chapter in the book that talks about how to get your email inbox to zero. My company, you think productive runs, um, three hour workshops. And what I've tried to do is take that three hour workshop and put it into that chapter of the book. So if you spend about 45 minutes to an hour, just kind of reading that chapter with your email in front of you, and then about an hour going through the stuff that it says your inbox will be at zero. Like we did a, we did some, uh, like stats over our three hour workshop and we found that 96% of people in that three hours left the room with their inbox at zero. So it doesn't take you anywhere near as long as you think what it does mean. Like for the most part, people have their email inbox open in front of them, but they're also working on lots of other things at the same, right.

Speaker 1:          16:48          It's the same time, right? So like for me, when you get really focused around just email, you can actually start to, you know, hack some of that stuff away, delete anything that's older than, you know, a few days or whatever. And you really start to get to zero very, very quickly. Um, next one I'll talk about is I'm a thing called stealth and camouflage. A Ninja has to be, uh, able to get slightly off the grid at different times. So the main part of this song, it's about his tactical hiding. Okay. So, um, you guys are very used to working in a very kind of open plan, open kind of culture. Um, I think there's some really nice benefits to that for sure. Um, it also has some limitations and one of those limitations probably as you're sat here listening to me, one of the things you're thinking is, well, it's all very well for him.

Speaker 1:          17:33          He probably like works Lowe's at the time on his own. He doesn't have less people interrupting him at his desk all the time. Um, and you know, I get this complaint a lot from people saying, you know, I just, I really want to get my head down. I really want to get into that kind of Zen, like calm kind of modes. But actually the thing that's really stopping me is someone comes and me a question and then I get loads, more emails and loads of other stuff's going on. Um, so really thinking about how we can avoid that. And I often say to people, you know, if you're, if you're feeling like you're being interrupted the whole time, make yourself just deliberately less available for some people that's going to work from a coffee shop around the corner, finding little cupboard somewhere where no one's going to find you a, you know, whatever that looks like.

Speaker 1:          18:09          But just trying to again, protect those two to three hours of time, proactive attention, time to really kind of get down and get your head down and get really kind of focused on things. And it doesn't have to just be a physical thing as well. So, um, stuff that camouflage in a more kind of digital sense and both outlook and Gmail both have a function of work offline, which I think it's just a criminally underused thing. The amount of times I'll say to people, do you use work offline? And people don't tend to use it. But just the idea of that is that you can work on the stuff that's in front of you. You can see the emails, you can see the calendar, whatever it is, but actually what you, uh, don't have is the kind of new notifications coming in and the new emails coming in.

Speaker 1:          18:46          So just using that work offline thing, really nice way to just kind of slightly make yourself less available and slightly kind of, you know, get into more of a kind of focus mood. Uh, this one here is an app called forest, um, who's come across forest. Any forest fans in a few. Good, good. So, um, Forrest is a really nice little app for, for focus. Um, so the idea is that you set a period of time, says, let's say it's 20 minutes, half an hour, and you say, I'm going to really get my head down and focus on this one thing. Often the thing that gets in the way it's like is just, Oh, what's on my phone, right? Let me pick up my phone and have a look and see what's going on there. And so what does is it starts to build a tree.

Speaker 1:          19:20          So you've got this 20 minutes, half an hour, it's, it's building this tree. If during that 20 minutes, half an hour it, you attempted to pick up your phone and go and look at Twitter or Facebook or whatever the tree dies, right? So, so really kind of smaller. I think all it's doing is putting one tiny, tiny little kind of positive reason to not look at your phone. I'm in competition with all those kinds of other things that are going on in your head and it's remarkably effective. The other thing about forest is that as a company, they invest some of their, their profits in planting real trees. So you can actually get a real guilt right from like the tree dying. It's a real tree. You have to think about it in that way. Um, but really nice app, there's a whole new chapter.

Speaker 1:          20:05          The updated version of the book has a whole chapter called stop messing about on your phone. And one of the things that it talks about is basically treating yourself like a kid. Um, for those two to three hours of practice of attention. So I have an APP on my android phone, it's called quality time. Uh, there's some other iPhone equivalent to that of it as well. But basically what quality time does is it allows me to set scheduled breaks. So in that schedule break, it's like in, in that two to three hours, these are the things that I can now access on my phone. Everything else on my phone is locked for that time. So this kind of two to three hours of the day, I have no access to Google chrome. I have no access to Instagram, I have no access to Twitter. All those things are locked down.

Speaker 1:          20:44          They are unavailable. If I want to get them back, then what I have to do is I have to cancel the scheduled break and the clock starts ticking. Five minutes, four minutes, 59, four minutes, 58. Usually as you watch that clock ticking down, it's got to get all the way to zero before you're allowed to turn the thing off. I'm usually, that's long enough years ago. Ah, screw this. I'm not going to sit around for five minutes waiting for the thing. So it just tends to be, again, just a nice piece of psychology that keeps you locked away from those things for those times and just gives you that kind of extra focus. Um, and obviously the more you know basic version of that, it's just using the airplane mode, just using the do not disturb kind of features of the phone. Um, just to keep some of that stuff in a more kind of stuff and camouflage kind of mode the same.

Speaker 1:          21:23          I think it can be applied to people as well. So actually just having conversations in your team, you know, um, like what's the time where I really need to get my head down and focus? What are the times when you need to do that? How can we kind of share those responsibilities and make that happen for each other? How can we do that within the teams? So just for me, I feel like when I go into organizations often it's, it's really amazing to me how many of those conversations are just left unsaid. And it sort of builds up in bubbles up intentional ever. But really it never gets put on the table. Like what's the expectation around email? What's the expectation around my attention? Like people don't have those conversations is as often as perhaps we need to do that. Um, next one gets about is unorthodoxy I'm just doing things differently thinking in a very different way.

Speaker 1:          22:04          Um, I think that's probably fairly self evident coming into Google to talk about that. But you know, just I, I go into so many companies were, what really happens a lot is that people spend a lot of time looking at their direct competitors, looking at the, the direct market that they're there, they're in or around and trying to get inspiration from what everybody else in their sector is doing. And I'm a huge fan of just looking way beyond that and just kind of thinking, how would someone else solve this problem? How would someone else do that piece of thinking? How so, how would someone else to communicate those kind of ideas. So thinking about it from them, you know, the point of view of someone very principled like Malala or how would you explain this problem to a really curious intelligence six year olds? So just thinking about those kinds of different ways to approach that same idea or that same piece of thinking and coming up with a solution.

Speaker 1:          22:50          The other thing around, um, an orthodoxy is experimentation. So, um, I'm a big believer that all of us are very stuck in ruts with our own habits and the way that we work. So a couple of years ago I did this thing, I did 12 extreme productivity experiments and one for each month. And the idea was to just challenge all of my initial assumptions around productivity and the way I worked. So I did things like one was called flipping the nine to five. So I worked five til 9:00 AM and then clocked off for the day at 9:00 AM I did the same five to 9:00 PM. So I had the whole day and then have my four hours of work. And what was incredible about that was, um, you know, I only had four hours a day and I thought I was like super focused and super productive already. But having these, there's this limitation of four hours really maybe think twice about some of the things I was doing.

Speaker 1:          23:36          I think constraints is always a really beautiful thing to really get us to a much stronger sense of focus. I still use some of the kind of lessons from that one. Um, I also tried one a, which was a working an hour a day, seven days a week. So literally like one hour bursts, but seven days a week just to see how that would feel. Um, it turns out I was really stressed for like post, uh, you do need more than an hour a day. Generally. It depends on what you're doing. I did one, which was whenever I feel clear about decision or I'm slightly procrastinating about a decision, I made that decision by the throw of dice. So what that meant is I had to come up with one. I had to come up with basically like a two or three or six. Uh, different, uh, like answers to the question and then, you know, so sometimes, you know, if you're really stuck with something, being forced to come up with six different ways of thinking about it just helps you to open up your brain and kind of think about things in a different way.

Speaker 1:          24:27          The other thing about that one was it was really amazing to be able to detach ego from decisions. It's like, well, I didn't decide that the dice did, you know, three different thing. Um, but just I think, you know, I say that because not necessarily expecting you to go back to your bosses and say, I just want to work an hour a day. Um, but I think for me, doing those kind of experiments from extremity is a really nice way to then get back to some kind of sense of normality. But with new learning, I think often learning comes from these extreme things that comes when you're outside of your comfort zone. Um, and I, I learned so much by doing that and I think we can do those things really simply in our day to day, you know. So just getting off the bus or the tube, like a stop early and just kind of exploring the area for 10 minutes before where it just puts your brain in a really different thing.

Speaker 1:          25:09          It gets you out of this sense of everyday starts the same way and every day he has this like certain rhythm to it. So if you're someone that always gets into the office and the first thing you're doing is on your phone, on your email, like try having the first two hours with no phone and no email and just see what that's like. Um, if you're someone who usually solves the thing by getting up a document on the screen and try and doing it, just pen and paper. So sometimes just those really tiny little changes in habitually how we work could just make a huge difference to the way we think about certain things it takes when you talk about is agility. So this idea of um, a zen like calm and, and a lot of the ideas around a second brain and having autonomy around our work, they can be really compromised where suddenly there's a big fire that we have to fight.

Speaker 1:          25:50          There's some big thing going on and we have to react to that. So I'd say around that is, you know, we have to be really aware of where those things might be coming from, but also having a really good starting point. If you're not in, if you don't feel right now, like you're in some kind of big firefighting emergency kind of modes, one of the best things you can be doing is really taking stock in, like getting clear on what you are working on because you know that some other emergency will come along, there will be another fire. So like getting to a place where you really know what you're working on and getting real clarity around that stuff, it makes it much easier to drop those things. It makes it much easier when your boss comes in and says, right, can you work on this for three days?

Speaker 1:          26:26          It's like, well, I can drop all that because this is what I was working on before. We all agree that this is the more important thing. So getting that kind of sense of, um, sort of clarity and being organized around your work, um, is just the most useful thing at the point where a crisis hits because it's the time when you really need to know what you're, and being able to do that in a more, in a way that kind of feels more, um, you know, just more comfortable and, and you're, you're more able to, to know what you're going to leave behind. Um, it can often be a sort of point of crisis that really where we really start to, uh, just look at the small things and kind of sweat the small stuff rather than really kind of thinking much bigger. So the other thing is just habitually to really be thinking what could be on the radar.

Speaker 1:          27:06          Like really thinking about that kind of future. Uh, you know, like, uh, what might be coming up and anticipating problems before they happen. Usually just the best way to solve problems is, is to try and nip them in the bud and not let these things become big things. And the other thing about agility is just to dispel the myth of multitasking. I was talking about, uh, talking about this with somebody just before we started. Um, a lot of the old time management books you said talking about the holy grail is multitasking. Like do two things at the same time and then you'll be much more productive. Um, actually like all the science points to the fact that it's really hard for your brain to do to, to thinking tasks at the same time. So multitasking really doesn't exist in that way. And in the kind of stuff we're doing, we need to focus much more on the idea of mono-tasking like doing one thing at a time, doing one thing with focus.

Speaker 1:          27:50          And that can be as applicable to the desk space in front of you. So not having five different bits of paper that relates to five different projects when you're trying to focus on one, just like putting those things in a drawer or to one side, same with your desktop, like who's got hundreds of different open windows on your computer and like hundreds of different, uh, you know, like unfiled, uh, things that kind of get in the way. So really kind of getting that focus around mono-tasking not multitasking really, really helps. A couple more before we finish. Uh, mindfulness. Um, so when I first read the book, um, about five years ago, um, I was really struggling to find the time and the space to, to do that cause I had a business to run and all the rest of it. So like, it was this thing that kept coming up every week.

Speaker 1:          28:33          I looked at my to do list, it was like write book. I was like, oh, I'm not really, that's not really happening. What do I need to do? So what I did was something quite extreme. I, um, I booked a plane ticket to Sri Lanka. I found a beach shot that have no Wifi, no phone signal. I was totally kind of off the grid and I went away to Sri Lanka and I wrote the book and I didn't really have very many conversations a while. I was there with different people, um, because I was just kind of on my own. Um, but I did meet a Buddhist monk at the bus stop and basically the Buddhist monk, uh, asked me to come to the monastery and taught me meditation and it was a really beautiful thing. Like a meditation wasn't supposed to be one of the characteristics in the book, but I was there and I was writing the book and suddenly I was having this experience around meditation.

Speaker 1:          29:14          It's like this has to be in the book, it has to be a thing. And I thought it was risky in at that point to put meditation and mindfulness in the book. And I was going to go into my corporate clients and they're going to be like, this is all a bit hippy. We were, what's going on? And what's happened in the last few years is that the opposite is becoming true, which is that mindfulness has become such a saturation thing. And you get all these really annoying things on Twitter that say the one thing you need to do to be a better leader, meditate for five minutes a day. Oh, well, if only it was that easy. Great. You know? So I think, you know, meditation is an amazing tool. It's not for everybody. And I think there are lots of different ways in my mind that we can get to a place of mindfulness.

Speaker 1:          29:50          Really. You know, for me, my phone's has kind of noticing your thoughts, noticing the things that you might be stressed about in that moment, and starting to really understand where your brain might be going in, in certain things. So you can get that just to be walking lots and lots and lots of different ways that you can start to really understand your brain. Um, and for me, the benefit of that is thinking about this idea of the lizard brain. Um, so, uh, the lizard brain is the Amygdala. It's the part of your brain that gives you this, this fight or flight response, and often the things that become really tricky for us to do or we start to procrastinate over or we're scared about because the lizard brain is having some big response to it. So for example, when I put a book out into the world, my lizard brain is kind of saying to me, don't do this.

Speaker 1:          30:32          And the reason for that is that books are going to be judged, right? People are going to write Amazon reviews about them and you know people are going to make judgments about what you do. And that's a scary thing. It's the same reason if you're going to stand up and give a presentation in front of a bunch of your colleagues or even worse, a bunch of your bosses, it's like, I'm going to be judged here. This is just becomes a scary thing. So recognizing that that Lizard brain is Austin going to try and sabotage it. It's going to try and get in the way. It's going to try and give you a period of procrastination rather than a period of really useful work. Um, so when we start to recognize that that's lizard brain thinking, we can start to override it and do something differently.

Speaker 1:          31:08          And for me mindfulness is one of the best ways that we can start to get into that, that kind of place. I think also mindfulness is just a really useful thing to help us just take a step back and realize how we've, how far we've come. Um, so, uh, this is always quite good point in the year. I think when people start to kind of take stock of where they were last year and what they want to do this year. Um, so just kind of taking that step back sometimes and kind of thinking how far we have Commonwealth, what we have achieved. Um, a really nice, uh, productivity tip that doesn't feel like one is, you know, once a week or on a kind of regular basis. Right. Have done list. So as well as your to do list, right. A half done list. It's a really nice empowering thing.

Speaker 1:          31:47          Um, also just kind of overrides that lizard brain thinking of like, oh, I'm not capable. I'm feel guilty that I've not achieved this, you know, just gives you that kind of sense of momentum, which again fuels the next kind of round of productivity. Um, preparedness. Um, one of the things I talk about in the book is, um, an idea called the weekly checklist. So this is a thing that you do once a week where you just kind of take a step back from all of the work that you're doing and you prioritize just really clear thinking. Um, and sometimes it, one of the things I come across quite a lot in businesses is people feel like they don't have the time for clear thinking. Um, it just feels like a luxury. It feels like something that I'll do when everything dies down or when everything changes.

Speaker 1:          32:27          Um, Henry Ford has this amazing quote, which is thinking is the hardest work there is, which is the probable reason so few engage in it. And I really love that quote because I think for me, you know, when in a knowledge work job, our job is to add value and create value attic information, the way we think and really quality thinking is the biggest asset that we have. Our brains are our biggest tool. Um, so taking some time to step back and really look at your projects, look at your second brain, makes sure all that kind of stuff feels fresh. I think sometimes, um, to do lists kind of fall apart and the apps fall apart because we lose trust in what the data is within those apps. So we start to look at what's in the APP and we start to go, oh, I know there's more stuff in my head so I don't quite trust the APP has being the full record of everything that I've got.

Speaker 1:          33:12          And then we lose trust in it. We stopped using it and it kind of changes. So really having that weekly checklist, having that regular time where your only job really is to interact with those lists and really get clear on what's on your plate, um, is a really nice way of keeping those things fresh and ultimately gives you more focus. But there is a cost to that, which is a little bit of maintenance time. So just coming back and using those checklists to, to really make those good decisions happen. The other thing about preparedness is, um, uh, the idea of, uh, our, our biggest tool being our brain, um, is basically sleep. And this slide is just to indicate the sleep is a good thing and it's really good to get enough sleep. So I think, um, when you think about your tool, your biggest tool being your brain, I'm getting good sleep and all's a whole lot of other stuff.

Speaker 1:          33:58          You know, hydration's a really important thing and stuff that we kind of know. Um, I've just actually just finished writing a book and called work fuel, which is all about nutrition and how to eat to have better energy. Looking at the things on your plate Scougal as you're doing a good job. Uh, it's good. Um, but I think, uh, it's just one of those really underrated things. You know, they're there. I really couldn't find any books out there that looked at nutrition and productivity and kind of marry those two things in a really specific way. So I've been working with a nutritionist called Collette Hennigan, who is my nutritionist for a couple of years to really put that into practice. So that comes out in March. And, um, I think, you know, for me all of those things that help us to fuel our brain, whether it be nutrition, whether it be sleep, whether it be hydration, exercise, you know, mindfulness to extent can do the same thing, but just all those things that are really important to, to give us as much of that energy and proactive attention as possible.

Speaker 1:          34:49          Um, and finally, just to say that, um, acumen and Ninja is a human but not a superhero. So when you do a lot of the stuff that's in the book, when you really start to have a really good second brain are really good, uh, like loads of apps and tools that you're using. When you've really got the best kind of productivity up that you have, people will look at you across the office and they'll say, oh, this person just feels like a superhero. Like they're doing all this amazing stuff. You'll start to be really valued because of that. And often people will start to come, you know, how do they do like have they got some kind of special super power? Um, and really none of us have super powers. We're all just humans but with good tools and good ways of thinking and all of that stuff.

Speaker 1:          35:29          Um, and I think that's a really useful thing to come back and remind ourselves of regularly. Just this idea of being human, not Superhero, um, cause well that, that doesn't mean is that we have limitations. It doesn't mean that we need to acknowledge that humanist sometimes and not work ourselves too hard, too often because ultimately we're going to risk burnout by doing that. Um, and we also need to kind of recognize that humans do need that time to kind of refresh the Mojo a little bit and kind of come back to who we are outside of work and be a human being, not just a human doing. I'm, so for me that's a really, uh, important, uh, part of the whole productivity Ninja philosophy really is this idea of human not superhero. And I think productivity is one of those topics that it would be really boring if you could just systematize everything and everything could just be done by robots.

Speaker 1:          36:16          And then it's all kind of done. Um, you know, there's no challenge in that. For me. I think the interesting part of productivity for me is that we all come to this with all those kinds of weird thoughts that we have in our brain. Um, so I've done, um, with my podcast, I have a podcast called beyond busy. I've done about a hundred interviews now with I'm often very high achieving people and people often sort of say to me like, what's the, having done all that work and some of these really long in depth conversations with high achieving people. Like what's the kind of commonality, one of the things that these people have in common? And I would say, well, the only thing I can find that once people have in common is that humans are weird. Humans are weird. And we all come at all of our work with a lot of, um, you know, kind of mental baggage if you like.

Speaker 1:          36:59          We have a lot of thoughts and I had that, uh, derail us, try and stop what we're doing, try and get in the way of what we're doing. And actually by coming back and reconnecting with the humanness, I think that's where we start to recognize some those things, overcome some of those things. Um, and also, um, you know, by doing that we start to realize that productivity is a really amazing thing. Like humans are amazing. Like we do so much amazing stuff. Um, and despite all those limitations, despite all these things, we can just do amazing work.
