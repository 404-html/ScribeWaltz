Speaker 1:          00:06          Hello everyone and please join me in welcoming us if Sally

Speaker 1:          00:14          awesome. As a senior director of strategy, communications and empowerment for BRAC and BRAC international here receives the advocacy information and communication technology and communications departments as well as social innovation lab. He also manages bracs empowerment initiatives including human rights and legal aid services, migration, urban and use skills development programs. Prior to joining Brac in 2011 he was the executive director at Goldman Sachs and previously worked for IBM. He was recognized for his work by Asia Society's Asia 21 program, the Bango that she American foundation and it was selected as an Asia 21 fellow awesome connects private and social sectors to develop and scale innovations that uplift some of the world's poorest people. A bit of context on Brac brack is the world's largest nonprofit organization and is based in Bangladesh. It's a global leader in developing and implementing cost effective evidence based programs to assist more marginalized people and extremely poor conflict prone and post disaster settings. These include initiatives in education, healthcare, micro finance, girls' empowerment, agriculture, human and legal rights, and more. In 2016, brack employed more than 110,000 people in 11 countries with a global expenditure of about 900 million. With low middle income countries like Bangladesh develop, developing very rapidly, both high and low tech solutions will be instrumental in bridging group growing socio economic divide as it provides insight on how Brac we'll reach 130 million people and changing the way poverty is addressed worldwide. Thank you. Please take the floor.

Speaker 1:          02:20          Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:21          Let me start off talking about a little bit about myself. Uh, just to give up, give up personal context. I grew up in Bangladesh and that when I was 18, I left, uh, to get my higher education in the United States. So I got a degree in computer science. Um, and uh, when I graduated, what I wanted to do with my life was more about solving business problems. Then I graduated at the time when there was tech jobs were quite plentiful. And, um, I, I landed with four offers before I finished my graduation and I decided to take up a job at Goldman Sachs. And, uh, um, my motivation was that I didn't want to be a programmer who was just coding at the back bench, just nobody looks at him. I actually want it to be what I work with people and solve problems. And before I knew it, I spent almost a 12 years at Goldman and um, but, uh, working with trading and electronic trading algorithms and all these things, but something was not quite right.

Speaker 2:          03:24          And, um, this, I felt like this was not quite about what I was meant to do, probably not the kind of problems I wanted to solve with for the rest of my life. So I started a charity back in 2001 and my free time, uh, which was a platform for diaspora Bangladeshis to connect and also work on a cause for human rights, uh, victims in Bangladesh. And a, the idea was that to raise awareness, uh, on human rights issues and also to rehabilitate them and glad to see there is a fellow member here as [inaudible] who was here, who was a member of this. And I connected with a lot of young Bangladeshis during that time. And the organization actually, uh, grew quite rapidly. Um, before I knew it, we had like nine chapters in nine cities and we were connected, uh, all around the world and we were doing projects and we had 5,000 people in our network.

Speaker 2:          04:20          Uh, so, and that was my thing. I, I figured that this is something that I was prone to do. And, uh, so I, I had to take a leap of faith. I had to decide what I wanted to do that with the rest of my life. So, um, at one point I decided to end my career at Goldman and moved back to Bangladesh and, um, started to work in the development sector. And then that's where they were kind of the rest of my life started. So I, um, I actually from the number one investment bank, uh, I joined the number one NGO, which is the Brac. So quite a, quite a, quite a large shift. But interestingly, from what to add to what Sylvia said about Brag, uh, I think when I joined Bragg, it was a quite an interesting learning because a Brac is something so unique that uh, there isn't a lot of charity organizations like Brag because um, I'm Brad kind of users, whatever works to solve a development problems.

Speaker 2:          05:24          So whether it's a business is, it's a market based solutions, I think it's, it's fairly agnostic to what kind of solution would work. And that resulted to brag from being a very small relief organizations to what a giant bay mode that is right now, which has very, very large scale programs in education law running the largest, a non government school network to one of the largest microfinance network to a very big health networks all around the country. And it expanded outside Bangladesh about 12 years ago now it's in 12 other countries. So as you heard that, you know, it's a total budget in global, but it is about one point $1 billion with about 70% of Bangladeshis budget comes from its own resources. And we are slowly towards a, are on a path to become self dependent for our Bangladesh programs in the next five to seven years.

Speaker 2:          06:19          So, um, but what a Brac has is that, you know, it's quite unique in the sense that it has these large scale programs that I mentioned. It also has about 15 social enterprises. It has about seven large investments that it made, um, from a bank to insurance companies to um, various, uh, uh, other at a university is, it's, it's, it's a quite unique, but there is a kind of a method to all this, uh, large expansion. And in order to get to that, I think I should talk about a quote that our founder, surface foster has an APP. It talks about a lot of time, which is a poverty is not just poverty of money or income. We also see a poverty of self esteem, hope, opportunity and freedom. People trapped in a cycle of destitution often don't realize their lives can be changed for the better through their own activities.

Speaker 2:          07:17          Once they understand that, it's like a light gets turned on. So at Brac we are in the business of turning those lights on. So where there, it's about financial inclusion or education or any of our livelihood's program, it's all about turning that light on, giving people the tool so that they can change their lives. So today I'm going to tell you two stories, uh, 30 years apart, uh, about two of the biggest challenges we've faced and what we learned about the role of technology and social innovation in those challenges. Um, so first case story is about a fairly low tech solution with a high touch approach. Um, imagine you are an illiterate mother. Um, back in the early eighties in Bangladesh, in the rural Bangladesh, you live in an extremely remote region. Uh, the country's still reeling economy Lee from the war that happened about 10 years ago.

Speaker 2:          08:18          But this isn't your biggest concern. Your concern is about your sexual sec child was suffering from diarrhea and uh, your thoughts are consumed with her because you don't know what to do. The nearest hospital is about five miles. You don't have the money to take your child to the hospital. You don't have access to any physician a nearby. So what do you do in that situation? Um, particularly when you know that about one out of five children in your community dies in a suffering from diarrhea. Um, diarrhea, dehydration that caused from diarrhea and cholera was one of the primary killers, uh, of child under five, uh, in, in Bangladesh. A about one out of seven children in Bangladesh in the right after a war would actually won't make it to their fifth birthday. So when that's the scenario you're working on, actually this kind of related of why we had so many children a, each household had so many children in there because if you don't know how many would survive, you actually don't think about family planning that much.

Speaker 2:          09:28          Uh, actually recently there was a code by Melinda Gates the other day who highlighted that if parents believe their children will survive and if they have the power to time and space their pregnancies, they chew, they would choose to have fewer children. So parents living in poverty in rural Bangladesh didn't have control of what their children's lives or, or their futures. So it wasn't that there wasn't a solution, uh, available. There was actually in the 60s, there was a breakthrough in treatment for diarrhea, right? A concoction of water sugar and salt called oral rehydration therapy or OT was tested by a group of researchers. However, um, this, this concoction that you, if you give, given to the children at the right time, it would actually save 96.5% of the children as opposed to 70% who would not make it. But the problem there was another problem with the treatment was out of reach for poor families and remained mostly in the hospitals because, uh, one, uh, you have to get the proportion right.

Speaker 2:          10:38          The researchers did have the idea that, um, that at some point they will, um, marketed and they will make the instruction available for people. But when you have illiterate mothers all around the country, that instruction is actually not very useful when you have, um, instructions about giving spoons and measurements, right. When you, most of the households don't have even spoons doesn't really work. So what, uh, what do you do in that kind of situation? Because if you don't get the measurement right, if you have too much salt, it may kill your baby. If you have too much sugar, it may actually reverse the effect of the Ortiz what is aligned. So that's where the, I guess the power of delivery comes in around that time. Uh, so brack was about 10 years old and um, there was a guy called surface that has an abbot who moved back from London living his cushy job at Shell oil and uh, and decided that he was going to actually work towards rebuilding the, rebuilding the country after the war.

Speaker 2:          11:45          And, uh, pretty soon the relief organization actually slowly expanded or, um, into other, other development activities. And, um, he was from the private sector and he understood scale very well and he was all about problem solving. So when he heard about the problem, one of the things that he tried, but he was started experimenting in this kitchen with unrefined sugar, known as good in Bangladesh, which is fairly well available in rural areas, rural areas. So he found out that about three finger pinch of salt, a handful of sugar, um, good. Um, and half a liter of boiled water actually can make the same, have the same effect that this World Health Organization that came up with the antidote for the RT solution. So, so that's how the easy to make solution arrived. Um, but then how do you actually teach it to the rest of the country? How do you actually go to mothers and tell them that this is actually going to work and this is what you should do?

Speaker 2:          12:55          So that's where the biggest challenge came in. And the, and World Bank's president recently said, uh, at a code that it's not the question of what to deliver. It's about, it's about how to deliver it in the, when in the social development space. It's all about, not the, not the digital innovation itself, but how do you actually deliver the innovation. So our media advocacy campaign would have worked at that time. I wouldn't have worked at that time because only 20% people have access to radio and television. So it would have to be centered on the ground, people talking to people, people changing behaviors. So that's what Brac started to do. So it recruited that small groups of women from communities to become health promoters themselves. The group traveled on foot, um, went door to door, showing mothers how to make these solutions. Later monitors went in and checked whether how many of those mothers actually learned how to make those solutions.

Speaker 2:          14:00          And it was an iterative process. There was failures and plentiful we learned as we go along. Went along, so stuff to it, their approach as they went along. And, and one thing, I'm sorry, just to, and, and, and one example of our learning has been that when the monitors went back after the first lot of training happen, we found out that about 90% of this mothers learn how to make those solutions. So you would think that was a success, but only 10% of them actually gave it to their children when the children were sick. So people were struck scratching their heads what went wrong. A group of anthropologists were sent to do some research and they found out was very interesting, uh, not rocket science, but because the mothers, the fathers weren't involved in this process and they were the key decision makers. So they actually wouldn't let the mothers give this strange concoction to their child when they got sick.

Speaker 2:          15:01          So that's when the next battle started. So we started training men, we started training the fathers. So, and this is just an example, but there are other issues evolve. The process was continuously modified and which led to continuous improvement of the outcome itself. So Brag, then worked with the Bangladeshi government of course, uh, to kind of scale up nationwide. Uh, it basically eventually went to every single household in Bangladesh teaching mothers how to make ort and um, that's um, uh, media advocacy campaign followed to sustain the effect. Uh, eventually. And just to kind of finish off the story, um, I mean there, uh, there was a long article on this in New York, New Yorker magazine a couple of years ago. I'm just going to read a few coats, um, coaxing villagers to make the solution with their own hands and explain the messages in their own words while a trainer observed and guided them at youth far more than any public service ad or instructional video could have done.

Speaker 2:          16:11          Over time the changes could be sustained with television and radio and the growth of demand led to the development of a robust market for manufacturer oral rehydration salts three decades led later. National surveys have found that almost 90% of children with severe diarrhea where given the solution child deaths from diarrhea plummeted more than 80% between 1980 and 2005. Bangladesh. Now has the highest use of working in the world. So this is the quote I love and it's, I think it's relevant to a lot of a lot of you who are in technology. I mean we yearn for frictionless technology solutions, but people talking to people is still the way norms and standards change. Um, so there were some early lessons in this, uh, kind of just to kind of quickly summarize. Um, even in 30 years ago, I know data is big now, but even 30 years ago, data was king then at that time as well.

Speaker 2:          17:16          We constantly looked at the numbers and uh, evolved number two, social innovation is not just about a product innovation, it's about a continuous process of adjustment and tweaking as you go along. It's about process innovation as well. And number three, the simpler your solution is, the easier it is to scale. So it's very, very relevant to that. Uh, the part of the world we operate in. So fast forward about 30 years later. Uh, so this is the second case story I'm going to talk about. Uh, which was, is more about when high tech meets high touch. Um, how do you get rural women and men of course, to trust and understand that mobile money will improve their lives. Um, just to set a set a context and there's a, there's a story that, uh, you know, our microfinance director, uh, talks about that when we introduced a mobile money to, for our microfinance borrowers to pay their loans on time.

Speaker 2:          18:27          Um, they would send the money mobile money through their phone and then they would walk to our offices and come back, come and say that makes sure that it actually has come through. And, um, because I think that's, that's, you know, in a country where system often fails, you always want that piece of paper with a to make sure that this is your proof that you actually have done it. You don't actually have trust, a lot of trust in your system. So it, it, it was actually quite interesting because it do have them trust an SMS message I've confirmation was actually quite a large shift. So, um, the idea idea for mobile money came in from a different context. I mean, I think, uh, when 30 years they didn't like, you know, in Bangladesh has become a lot more urbanized, is not as real anymore.

Speaker 2:          19:22          Uh, also people have become a lot more mobile. They're traveling, they're seasonal migrants who are coming back and forth from villages to cities. They're working in the cities and they're wanting to send their money as in money to their families. So there was a big need of a safe, reliable, and affordable means of sending money back home. Of course, people found very creative way of sending money. They send it through the bus, overnight bus service. They would send the money through post office air through the selling airtime or physically carrying cash form every human's. Uh, but there was a big need of some something which actually did it quickly and reliably. So that's where the solution came in, which is the big cash, the mobile financial service. Um, inspired by the success in east Africa with M Pesa. Um, and some of the other companies that work really well in Africa, Brac bank started a be cash in 2011 with the mission towards including the very bottom of the people on financially, which means that actually not only just residents, but the big vision is that introducing financial products and services that works for the poor.

Speaker 2:          20:38          So, um, it, it was a great fit for Bangladesh because in Bangladesh we have 90% of the household which has mobile phone, but only 30% has bank accounts. So if you can give people with a phone bank account, it should work wonders. Um, but the problem was, I mean, just to, of, so before I get into the problem a bit, just to give you an understanding of how the solution worked. Um, it's not just a mobile to mobile money. It's a, there's a role of an agent network within the organization. The idea is that a rickshaw puller say who works in the city, wants to send money to his family, would actually go to an agent who would actually take the physical cash, put it in his bank account, uh, mobile. And mobile money account and then the have the money transferred to either directly to the, to the family or to an agent whose lives nearby, uh, to the, of the family member.

Speaker 2:          21:41          And then the family could use it. I mean, if the money was transferred to the bank account of the sender, they could also use it for other purposes as well, like, you know, buying things directly. But we don't see, we don't have the ecosystem yet quite, quite ready. So one is mostly being used for reference purposes. So this is how it works. Um, but the problem was that then it also went to 100 the delivery. Everybody, nobody knew be cash, right? Why would people trust be cash? But everybody knew Brac at that time and brags. This is just our sort of operations in terms of where we are, um, in terms of in the country itself. So we have a network all across the country. So what we started to build up with this agent network and we worked with all these borrowers that we have who actually owns stores.

Speaker 2:          22:41          So there are these small shop owners who we went to and says that, you know, you know, the community community knows you. Are you interested to be an agent? And, uh, initially there was like, not a lot of understanding, but people came along listening to us because we thought we said this is going to work for you and this is gonna work for everybody else in the community as well. So, but 10,000 agents signed up initially and once we did it and that's where the early adopters came in and then we started working with the use user, growing the user base, you're going forward. And the rest is pretty much history because I mean, because she has seen a very, very rapid expansion over the last five years. Just to show you some numbers. I mean, this is a slightly dated number, but we now have, uh, it is now the largest mobile financial service in terms of, uh, how many people have a direct accounts in the world right now where we have, uh, about, uh, close to in Bangladesh we have about 400 and so 41 million people with accounts and about 80% of them are big cash account holders.

Speaker 2:          23:50          Uh, you can see some of the numbers. We, uh, the rapid growth, I mean we have almost close to about $50 million being transacted daily. Um, and, um, now the agent network boasts about 600,000 or around the country. Um, just in, it all just happened in just four years. But I mean, we don't want to, we didn't want to rest in this Laurel. However, I mean, because as I, as I said that the primary mission was to actually empower the poor financially. So we looked at the numbers again and we saw that there were far less women who signed up than men for the big cash accounts. And at the same time people were still accessing it primarily as through the agent network, not directly accessing themselves ran. If you don't access it directly yourself, then financial products and services built up for you, you're not going to actually see a lot of benefit for it. So I'm going to see a small video in terms of how we took that as a next step in terms of increasing the literacy for women. And this will probably give you a bit of a glimpse, uh, of, uh, what we mean by this high touch involvement. Let's look at a two minute video very quickly.

Speaker 3:          25:07          Hm. Goodbye. Like Daca, Daca baggage with put them, if they do end up with them, she's [inaudible] she, she goes, you cannot put a segment on Dixie money leaves it at Bella [inaudible]. I'm rolling shutter stock. Oh, by the banker. [inaudible] and [inaudible] I guess the DDC transfer, the DC. Marsha, Marsha [inaudible]. I seem to literacy biggest [inaudible] right, okay. The dietitian isn't montage. Tronic PC, PC. I'm a good data.

Speaker 2:          28:03          So the work is still ongoing. I mean it's, uh, I think the user experience needs to be a lot better. So we are working on that. Uh, but I think this, uh, there are some key learnings, right? I mean, in both these two stories. Uh, so I think in, in person to person interaction does shift social norms and builds trust. And for, for a lot of technology adoption, adoption, um, um, it's not just about technology itself, right? It's about changing mindsets. So it's, it's, it's very important to have that person to person interaction. And the secondly, which is very relevant to the first one, that it's not just not the product itself and not, no, it's not how we deliver technology is actually as important, if not more than 10. The technology itself. And, uh, and the last one is that when high tech meets high touch, uh, the earlier days of tech adoption actually is, is it really happens at that time.

Speaker 2:          29:11          And, and, and I think that's, that's also where the magic happens. I think Adam and I want to sort of kind of end in that note that um, it's, I'm sitting in like 2017 right now. There are so many immense um, sort of providence that has happened in technology and about to come in the next few years and we are looking at uh, some amazing disruption can happen in this market. Um, you can think about, I'm imagining these hundred thousand health care promoters who are across the country having access to this tool diagnostic tool who can go house to house, collect data, send data to the cloud, have AI engine looking at it and give some, uh, diagnostic ideas and linked them to specialist solar on the world. Amazing things can happen if we, I'm thinking very focused, customized specific product, financial product being delivered to various groups all around the country because you have access to the data because you're sitting on a huge data gold mine.

Speaker 2:          30:23          Look, understanding when people send money, what people's, what we'll do with the money, you can actually come up with very, very useful products in the coming days. You can look at the jobs market, informal formal book, how you can make matches so that you can increase the wages for the people who don't have access to those key information. So, so amazing things can happen in the coming days. I mean, I just want to sort of think that, you know, if Google will all its resources, martyr engineers that are, you guys are all out here, you can partner with some of the small sophisticated distribution network that we have at Brac. Real magic can happen in the coming days and real disruption can happen. And personally speaking, over the last few years as I have learned to have bigger dreams, uh, I actually have learned to appreciate slow innovation and a lot more than I used to. This is a picture of a train station and a, particularly during the festival time, just I love to show this picture because in our presentation, I mean, it's a chaotic region. It's a chaotic country, enormously resource constraint.
