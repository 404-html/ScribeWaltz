Speaker 1:          00:06          Hi everyone. Thanks for joining this authors at this lunch time. Uh, I'm Yasmin Green. I, uh, run research and development for a group called Jigsaw, which is alphabet's technology incubator. They can't geopolitics. And I am delighted to welcome Gwen de sacs to talk to us today. Um, we're related, um, where we've got to figure out like the exact way to, to describe it, but Wendy's the sister of my, uh, husband's cousin's wife, um, there should be a short term, short, short hand for that. Um, so if you guys are anything like me, you feel some anxiety when you think about the evolving nature of work and a automation and globalization seem like they're trends that, uh, making more bleak, the prospects of us all being gainfully employed in the future. Um, and job security seems like a kind of romantic notion, um, from a past era. Um, and yet we still want, you know, Yan Fridge for work that's a noshing and stimulating and flexible.

Speaker 1:          01:15          And that brings us joy as well as pays the bills. Um, and, uh, sometimes we fantasize about charting a new path, uh, but we're not even sure where we'd start. Yeah. When it comes to that. So when we love the advice of somebody who has experience with every possible permutation of work life, family, and has reinvented themselves and captured their insights in a book that will help empower us and help us or thrive. And that is Wendy Sachs. That's the brilliance of Wendy. And Wendy has a very diverse and accomplished career, um, as a Emmy award winning producer of a TV news on date night and BBC, CNN, Fox and NBC, um, is a critically acclaimed author and journalist and has a, um, an eclectic career and politics in PR, including holding the title of not going to get this right. No, wait, she can credit me Capitol Hill, chief press secretary, Capitol Hill for a secretary. I'm editor in chief and also, which I didn't get the full one one from her about, but also a representative of Barney the purple dinosaur. So, um, anyway, without further ado, um, it's a great joy to welcome Wendy to share her insights with us today.

Speaker 2:          02:50          Yep. Thanks so much.

Speaker 1:          02:52          Thank you for that warm introduction. I'm, I'm honored to be related to Yaz even by some sort of cousin marriage. I'm

Speaker 3:          03:00          talking about fearless. I think that I don't know anyone who has more fearless and Badass and this woman who's doing incredible work here at Google. Um, so I say that I've pivoted so much in my career that I'm practically a wedding and you know, not all of my pivots have been intentional. I've been fired, I've lost my job a couple of times and you know, because everything today has an origin story, you know, every brand, everything. Um, my origin story of fearless and free begins when I lost my job in August of 2014 and um, I was working at a advertising agency and you know, sort of in mini tragedy to lose your job and advertising. It happens all the time. Um, and they, they gave me some notice and I knew I was going to be let go because I couldn't afford me anymore apparently.

Speaker 3:          03:50          And I started interviewing all around New York City. I started going to all of these, what I would call the bright and shiny startups. I'm sure you work with many of them here in New York. And I was going around looking for a job. My industry, media, you know, had been completely disrupted by digital. And I started really panicking because at this point I'm over 40 and I'm in an industry that is, you know, overrun by people now about 20 years younger than me. And I thought if I don't get a job soon, I'm not going to be relevant. And of course, as we all know, relevance is everything. So I was interviewing at one shop and I went in and of course it is, you know, a bearded millennial and that Flan all like the total cliche sitting across from me. And I take out, start taking out my resume, which is sort of lengthy at this, at this point in my bio.

Speaker 3:          04:39          And I handed him right away. I knew that there was trouble. Um, he said, we don't take paper resumes around here, we only want digital copies. And I was like, oh, a feeling embarrassed and shamed. And that clearly I was way too old for this company. I shoved my, my paper back in my bag and he opens up his Mac book and he's looking over my resume and he sees that I had worked on Capitol Hill. I was a press secretary Oh, while ago. But I still kept it on my resume because it was a position that I always felt very proud of. You know, up until this point had given me some gravitas and some credibility. And like a lot I like to say is that Capitol Hill was the Google of the gen x generation. It opened doors for us and open big careers for many people.

Speaker 3:          05:23          We all, you know, many people I know started there, went onto to big, big careers. But here, you know that the man looking at me sort of scoffed and said, you know, around here we have good relationships with the media. I wouldn't want you hanging up on any reporters or anything. And I, you know, completely startled by this. I said, you know, jokingly, well, I'm not a character in veep or the house of cards. I wasn't screaming at reporters, I was begging them to cover my member of Congress. He was a freshman member from accredited district in south Florida. He didn't even laugh at any of this. So after I, you know, started walking through the office, holding onto my paper resume and grabbing my coconut water and Kale chips. As I walked out, I'm feeling sort of depressed. I was walking down Fifth Avenue and I thought to myself, you know, something's got to change.

Speaker 3:          06:13          Obviously I have, you know, I've done what I think has been, you know, very interesting jobs in my career. I'm clearly qualified for these positions. What am I doing wrong? And I had this sort of epiphany and I started looking towards silicon valley. I was sort of always, you know, obsessed with the tech world the way that so many of us are. And because that toll startup spirit and tech world and Silicon Valley's basically directing everything we do today, as you know, better than anyone from how we shop to how we get our news and our attainment, how we target isis. You know, everything we do is coming from the startup space, silicon valley, the tech world. So one of the, one of the themes and one of the sort of characteristics that sort of struck me at this time, and it was because I had seen this New York magazine article about that whole failure, failure fetish coming out of Silicon Valley.

Speaker 3:          07:04          And I thought, well, I understand failure. I've failed a few times. Um, but what is it about that whole failure idea, that embracing of failure, that's so, you know, part of the DNA of the, of the tech world and why is it a badge of honor for these boys and the hoodies who launched companies that blow up, they're not going in climbing into a hole and disappearing. No, I mean, from what I'm reading, they're getting rehired or they're just pivoting on their business, right? That the venture capitalists are investing in the people and the talent behind the business, not necessarily the business idea. And of course there's a, you know, dozens of examples to point to. So I just love that idea. And I thought, what if women did that in their own careers? What have women sort of own that concept that we don't need to feel shamed if we lose a job?

Speaker 3:          07:55          And so many people do today, what if we really sort of invested in ourselves and leaned into our own skills and realize we just need to pivot. We need to iterate. And what if we were okay with that idea of failure? So as I started sort of digging into this concept of a failure, of course a cousin happy cousin to failure is success and it Albert Einstein, so many people have these great quotes around failure. He says, you know, failure is the pathway to success. Something like that. I'm paraphrasing that. But you know, that's that idea. So I started looking at confidence, right? So confidence is the foundation to, to building anything, to taking risks. And it's all about the risk taking. And of course, I'm sure you're all familiar with all of the studies that show, you know, men are more willing to take risks and women, we know men start more companies more.

Speaker 3:          08:43          It's startups in women. They certainly get the financing, the venture capital backing that women don't get, you know. So why is that? Um, so as I started looking into some of the research around confidence, I was looking at Claire Shipman and Katty Kay, I don't know if anyone here is familiar with their book, the Confidence Code, which sort of became my Bible as I was doing my own research on confidence and they found that there's this genetic connection with confidence that there's actually, you know, there's a genetic component sort of like you know who gets blue eyes or curly hair and they did their own DNA testing and they found very disappointing lay that they, neither one of them carry that genetic trade to actually create confidence. And of course this was incredibly disheartening to them because you want to think that you are, you know, genetically enabled to be confident.

Speaker 3:          09:30          But what they also found, which of course is very empowering, is that we can build confidence. Confidence is a muscle like resilience is a muscle that Sheryl Sandberg of course is recently talking about. Confidence is also a muscle. And the fastest way to become confident is to take risks. And women just chat generally are more risk averse in, we're taught this at an early age, we don't like to fail, we don't like to get things wrong. We don't like to take as many chances in hysterics really early on. So the more studies that I was uncovering and looking at the writings of Carol Dweck, who's a well known professor and she wrote a book called Mindset, she writes about that this starts at a very early age with that whole idea of a growth mindset versus fixed mindset. The idea that we sort of only know what we know is that fixed mindset that you know, you, you are good at math and that is what you know, but you would not be good at perhaps art.

Speaker 3:          10:31          Um, verse. That whole idea of a growth mindset that you can develop your skills and you can turn into, you can sort of evolve and you can iterate as you go. Well, this is really important, not just in the parenting space as it became recently adopted, because there's that whole concept that we're not supposed to tell her our daughters at. They're good at math because maybe in fifth grade they're good at math, but by ninth grade when math gets hard and they're not doing so well, they now take it personally and think, I guess I'm just not so good at math. We're supposed to praise the journey. So, but this is also very true to ourselves. If we can't accept the idea that we can continue to evolve and grow while we're going to get stuck. So these things were very interesting to me. This whole risk taking versus growth mindset versus fixed mindset and how we think about ourselves and how you know, our ability and our willingness to really take risks.

Speaker 3:          11:23          But along with this whole confidence and internal internalization of how we're feeling, it's also about how we present to the world. And so as I was writing this book, the book is not a memoir, but it very much a personal journey for me as I was exploring my own sort of, you know, what was happening out there in the workforce and how, what I needed to change. And it was also the election. And so during the election of course we saw how women are perceived. Of course the person carrying the mantle for all of us was Hillary Clinton. And we saw that the way that she was perceived to, you know, to the voters, to the population, to the media was that she came across as either too shrill, too on earth and authentic. She wasn't warm enough. She was judged to a different standard. And there is this, you know, famous Jimmy Kimmel sketch that, I don't know if any of you saw, but I write about in the book and in this one sketch he sorted, this is like what they called the mansplaning sketch.

Speaker 3:          12:22          And she, so Hillary's you standing behind a podium and she's pretending that she's giving her stump speech and she starts out, you know, a little bit loud. And He, Oh, you know, keep it down. Keep it down. The voice, the voice, it's a little too shrill, a little too loud. She drops it down. You got to raise your voice. You're sounding like a mouse up there. And then she begins again and he's like, you don't look for it. You got to smile more. You've got to smile. So she starts smiling. You look like a Lakers, girls, what's with the smile? You know, whatever she did and it went on and on. And then he's like, you know, I can't put my finger on it. I'm not sure. What is it? What is it about you that's just not right? I know you're not a man.

Speaker 3:          12:59          You're not a man. And that of course was, you know, the ultimate, you know, poking fun at exactly what was happening and exactly how she was being perceived. Um, and, and that of course is the double bind. And I'm sure is everyone here familiar with that double bind? The women in leadership at the double bind is the ultimate conundrum for women and leadership. And that is that when women present with more masculine characteristics that they are direct, are there, have a loud voice or they come off, you know, very strong, they're not well liked. There seem, you know, people see them as abrasive or they're bitches, they're not well, they're not well liked. But when women present with their more feminine qualities that they are nurturing and it seemed to be warm, engaging, maybe their voice isn't so loud, they're not thought to be strong leaders.

Speaker 3:          13:51          So that's the conundrum, right? That is the double bind. And then of course we saw that play out during the campaign. Not to say that Hillary Clinton didn't have, you know, other issues going on, but that was a big part of it. So all of this, you know, is happening as I'm writing the book, the campaign, I'm watching what's happening. And by the way, you know, just to compare and contrast, when you saw it, you knew this was not just a Democrat, republican thing. You see Bernie Sanders, who's, you know, pounding the podium and finger thrusting and he's messy and he's, you know, disheveled and he's loud and he's angry. And people love that. Right? People love that about Bernie. There was no, you're too loud. You're too obnoxious. Your hair's a mess. Fix your tie, you know, stop with the finger. No, that was manly. It was alpha.

Speaker 3:          14:36          It was legitimate. It was authentic, and people loved it. Women loved it. So that's really, really, that was very fascinating to me. And I think at some level, I also had this sort of personal association with all of this. Not that I'm anywhere near a Hillary Clinton's level, um, or will be, but I had been viewed in the workforce at one particular job as being too abrasive. I was told this in one of my job reviews that I came across as a little bit too abrasive to tough. Um, what I thought was being direct other people viewed and perceived as being the word that's commonly associated with women is abrasive. And I was horrified. I was. So I felt so, um, I don't want to say ashamed, but I felt so hurt actually. I mean, I, I didn't want people not to like me because everyone wants to be liked.

Speaker 3:          15:35          And by the way, likability and the workforce goes a really long way. Um, so I didn't know what to do about all of this. And so at the same time that this was all happening and I was feeling very sad about, you know, not being liked. Um, I wound up actually getting a new job and I went to the advertising agency I had mentioned before and I started saying, sorry a lot. I was just dropping in. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Where do I hang this report? Sorry. Opening the door. You know, when I go into a room, sorry. And I was adopting this, sorry, because there was another colleague of mine who, granted she was like blond in puttied and dimpled and very sweet. She would always say sorry. And no one ever thought that she was a bitch or that she was too direct or that she came across as abrasive.

Speaker 3:          16:20          So I thought I'm going to use this whole sorry thing and it worked like a charm. I'm telling you, I was with the like toughest creative guys who are, you know, feeling all bold and, and all, all that going on. But no one thought I was being too direct because I wasn't, I had dialed it back. And so interestingly at this time at the agency where I was working, there was a Pantene commercial that came out and I don't know if you remember, it was a few years ago and it got a lot of recognition and it was a campaign where they were showing it was for Pantene and there were showing all these different circumstances of women apologizing. So in one scene you see a woman on a subway and a man sits next hurt, his legs are spread open and she's doing this and she says, sorry.

Speaker 3:          17:07          And in another scene you see a kitchen and, and the woman is handing over a child, which looks like it's either to her husband or partner or whoever. As she handed the baby over, she says, sorry, another instance, a woman in an office is opening up a door. There's men sitting at the table and she says, sorry. And so it was a whole slew of Saris and basically they were making fun of the fact that women are apologizing all the time. So now I'm feeling sorry for saying sorry. And I quickly dropped my sorry. And it was at the ad agency where I was working at that they actually produce the ad. So it was just like total sort of awakening of what's going on. Um, and uh, during this time also, I'm sure you also heard of all of the other shrinker words that people talk about the justice and the actually's and the, am I making sense and all the language that really diminishes our power.

Speaker 3:          17:57          And Are you, does anyone know Tammy Reese in this room? So Tammy Reese actually created a g plugin that was going to be like these spellcheck four, sorry. And it got a lot of attention. I see some heads saying yes, it got a lot of attention. And, and I interviewed her for the book and she talks about the fact that it wasn't supposed to change the way that we communicate entirely. Like saying you know like shame on you for saying just, you know, because we think that sort of breezy sometimes you want to say just in a sentence, but her, her feeling was she wanted to make women aware of the language that they were using and how we are presenting to the world because it is so incredibly important to how we present. And so some of the suggestions that when I started asking some experts like, okay, we use these Justin, the actually is because we don't want to be seen as abrasive and to direct.

Speaker 3:          18:47          So we try to come across as a little, a little softer, but the suggestions are open in your email, warm and in your email, warm in the middle scrubbing. He just actually is in my making sense. And that's the smartest approach you do. And you can do that in person too. When you walk into a meeting, you can start with some small talk about the weather or whatever and but then be direct, smile and warm, you're done like, but there are no apologizing. And so I thought that was really also very, very interesting. What is it that women are doing that is in an advertently effecting our power, diminishing our strength to the world. So another theme that I also looked at, um, when again looking towards Silicon Valley for all of my answers, um, I looked at that concept of engineering serendipity. Do you all know what that is?

Speaker 3:          19:37          I feel like this is a group that engineering serendipity. So, so many of us think of serendipity as a happy accident, right? She's good fortune somehow like great things just happened. But actually there is strategy behind serendipity. We can make that magic happen. And a few years ago at south by southwest, it being a peak, it actually became sort of a theme of the conference. There was a bunch of sessions of, with creative agencies and tech companies all talking about this concept of engineering serendipity. We can create these amazing collisions of creativity. And innovation. Um, which to me was incredibly eye opening. Like, oh, we can actually make these things happen for us. Um, so the one man in my book is a guy named Mike and he's the only, he's the only dude in the book. And um, I call him the king of serendipity because while we have worked together several times, so I've benefited from his own kingdom of serendipity because he's hired me a few times.

Speaker 3:          20:39          He was always able to sort of maneuver between a whole bunch of different things. He was working for Larry Ellison and running some sort of startup company. He also was writing screenplays. He's also producing digital series. He, he was able, and he started out as a TV news journalist. So he somehow was able to, you know, zig zag between industries, make money, have three children and to me like sort of live the dream. And I would look to him thinking, how is he doing that? Well, part of it I realized is that he is a guy. So when he would invite me to go to, you know, networking events, he'd say, Hey, you should come out for drinks. You know, I'm meeting with this, you know, you know, movie producer, he's in from La and we're talking about this script that I just wrote. I would say, you know, I got to catch the train.

Speaker 3:          21:26          I got to get home. And, but somehow he was able to keep building his network, keep expanding his boundaries, and keep creating this magic for himself. So when I was looking into this whole concept of Engineering Serendipity, I interviewed Mike and I said, what is it? How did you do this? He actually had a formula for serendipity. I couldn't believe it. He has a mathematical equation that I'm not going to be able to remember right now. It's in my book, but it's about visibility, you know, sort of dividing by, you know, what you've done in the past and where you're located in. And it was like a whole formula to creating this perfect magic for himself. But what he was doing was something that's actually been studied for many, many years. And it's about this idea that you're opening boundaries and as you are expanding your networks, you're creating opportunities for yourself, but you're also being seen.

Speaker 3:          22:17          You're also being visible in, you're putting in the work, so it's not just magically appearing for you. You've actually done your homework, you've started a project, you've done some research, you've, you've, you know, created your side Gig. So you're doing something on the side. So now you're actually sort of getting there. You're, you're making, you're taking the steps to get there and now you're putting yourself in a place, whether it's a networking event or a conference or some sort of meetup where you're meeting with the right people. And then the key to all of it is that you're seizing on the opportunity that you're ready for it. You, you now have your eyes wide open and you can see the opportunity and you seize the moment. You don't, you're not held back by fear. You're not held back by feeling not confident. Um, so I thought that was really, really fascinating.

Speaker 3:          23:02          And by the way, as I was exploring serendipity, I saw that it happens here at Google. But you all must know about, I mean this whole innovation time off the 20% I don't know, does anyone actually do that? They take, okay, that is brilliant and revolutionary and that's another time where your company is saying to you, go explore, go innovate, go be creative, go take, have the head space to go work on something because we know that when you have the time and this sort of mental space to do it, great things are gonna happen. And that is really, really similar to this whole notion of serendipity and what has held a lot of women back. And I was actually interviewing a guy who's writing an entire book on Serendipity, is he said that women don't generally have the time to noodle. We don't have the time to be creative.

Speaker 3:          23:53          When we're working a full time job and we have a family and you're rushing to get home, pick up your child from daycare or make a train, you just don't have that time built in. Whereas men just sort of either create the time, aren't racing to get to the train or relieve the babysitter from daycare or their nanny this in the same way and they have more time. So I do think that there's definitely sort of a gender divide, a bit of a gender gap in this area because we tend to not have the time or not take it upon ourselves to be able to engineer this, this moment for ourselves. A serendipity. Um, the other issue that of course I kept exploring, which is part and parcel to everything in, in the tech world today is networking, right? So it's all about networking. Everything we do today is networking.

Speaker 3:          24:40          You know, that does, that is, that is the sort of foundation of how we connect. Um, and it's all about the networks. But one of the things that women haven't really had until very recently, our really strong female networks. And I will tell you, and I'm older than maybe a lot of you are sitting here in the room, but when I was coming up through the ranks and I worked in media, um, I had a lot of female bosses, but I never felt as if I didn't feel like it was an all out cat fight where we were like crawling over each other, trying to like get to the top. But I didn't feel like any of my bosses or any of the women who I worked with, they were trying to lift me with them. I didn't feel like they were raising me. I do feel like there was a smaller piece of the pie at the top.

Speaker 3:          25:22          They wanted to hold onto it, so they didn't sort of pull me along in the process. What I have really seen a huge change in the past few years or the amount of female networks out there in all different industries. Of course, you probably know about the tech industry is, and there's so many here in New York and there's so many in different, you know, from Nashville to Austin to San Francisco. What I'm talking about a whole bunch of different industries. I have a friend who was actually, she's an interior designer. She was out and think Sun Valley a few weekends ago with her female network of designers. And of course they're using technology. They're using the whatsapp chats and all of the in Facebook and different groups to connect and to support each other. This just didn't exist in the same way. So I was, as I was really sort of digging into female networks.

Speaker 3:          26:10          Um, of course I found the one that maybe some of you know about tech lady Mafia Tech Lady Mafia. So Amina sow, create a tech lady mafia with a friend. And the whole idea around, around this network, not just, you know, let's connect and support each other. But they actually have done something really, really, I think unique and really empowering for women and that they've codified this whole concept of asking for something and offering. So when you show up to a meetup for, for Tech Lady Mafia, it's that you might need something from someone and you're also willing to give. Because here's the thing we do. Women do not like to ask for help. We don't like to say, Hey, can you hook me up with someone? Hey, can you, you know, I'm helping me. I'm trying to design a website. I really don't know what I'm doing. We don't really like to ask for help.

Speaker 3:          27:01          We tend to just sort of take it all on ourselves. But they've actually codified this whole concept of asking and offering, which is really amazing to me. So that was one of the networks that I found. Um, but again, it's just sort of this whole sisterhood that I feel like we're really feeling across the country right now, particularly even after the election. As a side note, I'm working on a project following women who are running for office for the first time and some of these candidates have created their own political networks of other women, which again, completely sort of new and revolutionary, which is really going to change the whole landscape for women out there. So to create, to create our serendipity, we also have to have a strong network. We need to be able to lean into to women. We also need to be able to grow our networks because of course there's all of these studies that show you only know who you know, right?

Speaker 3:          27:52          So you're not going to really get jobs or find other opportunities only by the network of people you know, you need to keep expanding your boundaries. So I thought this was pretty fascinating too. And today, as you all know in the tech space, it's, you know, art meets technology, retail meets technology, entertainment meets technology. There's all these intersections today. And the more that we push out and meet people who we don't yet know and experience industries that we don't, who we don't, you know, or aren't familiar with, the more opportunity we have for ourselves. Um, and then the last or a theme that I was really sort of into because it's so obvious is branding, right? How do we talk about ourselves? How do we sort of share who we are? Again, this is a concept that a lot of women can be very squeamish about.

Speaker 3:          28:39          We don't like to brag about ourselves. We don't like to boast about what we've done. And this really came to light when I was, um, I was speaking in Washington DC a few weeks ago to a group of 50 female attorneys, all of them unemployed because they had all either worked at the White House for Obama or for the Justice Department under Obama. So we had 50 democratic women, female attorneys, all looking for a job. And they said, you know, it was in November when when Hillary lost the election, they knew they were going to need to find a new job and they started writing their resumes and they said, we work with all of these men. And you would have thought by looking at these guys resumes that they were running the justice department. They basically everything big that happened, they own, they did where the women really thought, well, I was like, I mean, I was at that meeting, I was on that team, you know, I can't really say I did that, you know, but the guys that, you know, they were like running the west wing also.

Speaker 3:          29:39          So, you know, it's such interesting gender divide in how we own what it is that we do and how we share with the world what it is that we do. But the only way for people to know is that visibility again, right? Everything is online, everything is through social media. Everything is about networking. If we don't tell people what it is that we do well, they're not going to know what we do well. And so particularly when you're looking for a job or you're looking to pivot or you're looking to explore, you're keeping your eyes open. People need to know what it is that you do well, you know, as the kids call it today, like what's your superpower? But you know, surely you need to sort of own your own narrative and what it is that you do and be able to share that with the world and not feel so squeamish about it. You know, it has been sort of thought to be impolite to brag, but I would like to sort of change that whole notion that, you know, branding yourself is not necessarily bragging. It's about letting people know what it is in the world that we do. Um, so I would love to like open this up to questions if anyone has questions so he's more fun to take questions.

Speaker 1:          30:46          Question. Yup. You most experience being a working woman, married and having kids, some of your preferences now that to life with the attorney. Um, and I look back at, I personally think I'm more, I feel Golda and more confident and more willing to take risk monitor everything from not my job, everything actually off to having a child. So that was a positive even though it presents it to him stream, but it also look back at my ESL and I'm like, wow, what a squandered opportunity to do more. Someone. That's a great point. I guess some of the people in this room don't have it yet. Have you found me? I'm wondering what those of us to do who doesn't yet have some of those other times, another commitment.

Speaker 3:          31:35          I think that's a great point. And I would say use that free time before you have children to your fullest. Explore everything that you can, you know, this is the time to create, you know, all of those, seize those opportunities and do everything that it is that you want to do from also even just traveling, seeing the world and having experiences. Because certainly in the early years and Zebra is young, you know, it's hard. It's hard. My kids are teenagers now and it's easier to have that also mental space. So I would not have been able to write this book a few years ago. I think that we also need that headspace to be able to explore and to noodle and to get creative. Um, I also think that it's really important for all of us at any stage in your life to really get comfortable in the uncomfortable. You know, that's the navy seals expression, um, for obvious reasons.

Speaker 3:          32:28          Uh, and I'm sure it's been adopted by others, but I really, I really by that belief, because that gives us all that opportunity to get used to feeling a little uncomfortable. That's where the greatest, you know, that's where all the amazing things that we're going to do are going to come from. That's where we're going, able to be able to grow the most and taking jobs that make us nervous, right? Like when we get too complacent, we're not bringing our a game. Um, and I'll see, you know, what's risky for one person is not risky for someone else. So it's figuring out what that risk is for you.

Speaker 2:          33:04          Anyone else?

Speaker 4:          33:06          Can you speak a bit more to the concept of pivoting and we launching? So, um, how in in your career have you, um, faced the need to pivot from perhaps one particular field to a completely different one? Or could you just talk a bit more about how that plays out? Sure.

Speaker 3:          33:30          You know, um, I, I have, I would say that the through line to my career has been storytelling, but that's before it was even called storytelling, right? It was called, you know, reporting. It was called journalism. It's called writing. Now. It's all storytelling. Um, I did, I really wanted to move into, I wanted to get some tech experience, although I'm not an engineer, I'm so not that kind of experience. I've never coded before, but I wanted to work for a tech company. So I had started on the hill. So I started in politics and then I moved to New York and I worked in TV. I worked at dateline, NBC and Fox. And then Larry Ellison was starting this new Internet computer company and I got a job to be his media director. The company really blew up, but it was my first experience going to ces back in the day before cs became like so wild.

Speaker 3:          34:21          Um, and so I did that. And then I actually written another book I'm about on work life balance called how she really does it. And that actually led me into going into what we would call the dark side for journalists. But I went into PR and I was doing the other side of it all, um, which I actually had an okay time with. Now, of course, that's called branded content. Everything that I was doing, you know, say the vernacular, it keeps changing. Um, so I would say that, you know, there's a bunch of different things to, to mention with pivoting for people who are going and doing a full one 80, you know, like I want to become a dentist now, we'll obviously that would be incredibly different and would require me to go to dental school. Um, but a lot of things when people say that they're pivoting, at least what I found, there are things that are a little bit almost companions to things that they're doing so they're not completely removed from their skillsets.

Speaker 3:          35:10          So my whole advice is about really leaning into your skills and just figuring out the new ones that you have to learn. And as you know better than anyone, you can do the stuff online. There's a lot of ways to take classes and you to have that whole side Gig that everyone, you know, seems to feel very romantic about these days. But having that sort of side project that you start noodling with to see, you know, is there a viability here? Am I any good at it at can I make money if I need to make money? You know, what can I really do? And what I've also found is just changing the language of how we talk about ourselves. I will tell you, I have scrubbed my linkedin profile in the past 10 years probably, you know, 35 times because I keep seeing where, how job descriptions are being posted.

Speaker 3:          35:58          Now. The language being used is so different than the language I was using. You know it. So now everything that I've done in my past seems to be storytelling and marketing. I would never have called myself a marketing person before. But yet that's what branded content is and that's what you know. And so it's, the world just keeps changing. So it's about also not feeling like a fraud for calling yourself, you know, putting that label on when you feel like that label isn't exactly what you went to school for. But that's what they're calling it now. And yes, your skills apply. So, I'm not saying lie and be a fraud at all, but I'm saying that we have to be a little bit more open minded and realize that to stay relevant you need to really see where trends are going and see how you fit in there. Or if you want, I could do a total relaunch, figure out what do you need to know and learn to completely shift gears, which could be incredibly different than what you know right now.

Speaker 1:          36:53          Okay.

Speaker 5:          36:53          Hey there. I'm, so, I was actually at the confidence girl code, whatever it's called, a conference. Yeah. Um, that, uh, they hosted a catty, catty Shipman and whatnot. And, and, uh, Baltimore a few months ago I was a panelist on the stem panel and so I took my daughter and we attended the whole conference actually, and you know, kind of a summary of some of the messages I heard was, you know, obviously be confidence, stand up straight, you know, give a firm handshake, look them in the eye, um, but be authentic, be yourself. And it was like this tug of war of, um, advice that I felt like was kind of contradictory in the message because at the end of the day we're telling women to sort of reshape themselves to be more acceptable in the male environment. Right. And, um, one of the things that I really liked about, you know, uh, Google and like the Silicon Valley is that this concept of you don't have to wear a suit to be taken seriously.

Speaker 5:          37:54          And so, uh, the point is that you can, you don't have to look a certain way as a man or a sound a certain way or even be particularly social, socially acceptable to be taken seriously. And you know, what really mattered was like that you were smart, you had great ideas and you got the thing done, right. So, I guess my, this is probably more of a comment to see you, what your response might be, but my hope is that we can get to a place where we can stop telling women to change themselves and get to a place where just like the culture we have built here, you can be whatever you need to be as a person and it's still, you'll still be accepted because of the you produce is excellent. Um, so you know, that that's sort of, I guess I'm kind of tired of hearing all the, you know, do this, do that.

Speaker 5:          38:44          And I did all those things. And so when I sit on panels now, would I say to the, to the young women thinking about careers in tech is, you know, I'm going to be honest with you. You can give, you know, you can stand up as straight as you can stand up, you can give from handshakes until you make their knuckles bleed. You can, you know, be the smartest person in the room, but you're always going to be disadvantaged because you're a woman and there's literally nothing you can do to change that. And so, uh, you know,

Speaker 3:          39:14          I think you're making all very important points that I think we can all really appreciate. And you know, one of the things that I, when I was talking about it, even writing about Hillary Clinton in the book and the way she was perceived in her shrill tone and she's not warm, she's not authentic, she's too smiley. She's, you know, whatever it may be. No one likes the way she looks in her suits. She needs to lose weight, all of that kind of stuff. You're absolutely right. And one of the women who I quote in the book, she talks about the fact that we need to rehear the way women speak. She actually makes this comparison to pre title nine and sports and women that the way that women in sports were perceived, you know, 20 years ago, I would argue still a bit today, um, that they're not given the same validity.

Speaker 3:          40:00          They're certainly not given the same money. We see that with the u s soccer team with a women's soccer, um, that they make less than men, yet they win way more than the guys do. Um, but even that whole idea that anyone should tune in and watch women play soccer, that has changed. Right? I would say that people still aren't really watching the women and be a league the way that they watched the men because people say it's not as exciting. Um, and they don't have the same kind of money. But the idea, the notion is that we as a country, as a people need to rehear the way that women speak. So if a woman is sounding a little, her voice is going to be higher than most men because that's the way women are built. To not discredit that and not think that that is, you know, Q harsh or too bitchy or too annoying that we almost adapt to that.

Speaker 3:          40:51          So I do think that, and maybe I'm being a little Pollyanna here, but I think as more women move up the ranks and as we lift more women, as the sisterhood keeps bringing women up with, with them, and as I'm seeing, and as I feel very strongly about that things will start changing. We'll see more females in technology. We'll see more women in leadership position, we'll see more women in Congress and we will adapt and accept the way they look, the way they sound, they will, the way that they communicate. And that is when things will start changing. But even women don't like the way that women present. I mean, we really saw that play out on the election. It was really sort of shocking to so many of us when we looked at the numbers and we looked at, you know, what was coming back. It was like women just didn't even like women. And that's another big issue of what needs to change.

Speaker 5:          41:38          Yeah. Yeah. I think I, you know, I think what I'd like to see is more books around how to, how to be a person that can just accept women the way they are. I mean, I w the advice when I, you know, I heard the advice around don't say I'm sorry you so much. I've heard it a lot and I really tried myself to not do it until I reached a point where I was like, you know what? Maybe we have it right to say you're sorry. It's like a good thing. It's like you're being kind and empathetic, compassionate, considerate. Maybe the advice should be to the assholes who treat people who say, I'm sorry, badly to not do that. Right. As opposed to the other way around.

Speaker 3:          42:12          Well, I think you're, you know, being authentic. There's nothing wrong with being authentic. I think that when we are authentic, that is actually the people who come across the most authentic are the ones who get jobs are well liked and there's tons of studies on all of that. But when we are faking it, people you know can size that up in a millisecond. I mean we see facial expressions and we're sort of brilliant at seeing an authenticity. So keep being you.

Speaker 1:          42:40          In your research, did you hear any murmurings or indications that perhaps men, are you learning and listening from how you approach things? You know, getting to the point of closing one lately, I don't think it's just what can we learn from them, right? And be better at what are we doing right. Is there anything,

Speaker 3:          43:03          well, I mean there are a lot of studies that show that the nurturing skills that women have are incredibly effective in leadership. And we also know that when women are at the top and organizations when they have more management roles, when they are in c suite roles, businesses do better. I mean that is like study after study after study proves that diversity is good for the bottom line. Um, I, I didn't really see that the guys are looking to women to sort of soften up or to be more collaborative or to do the things that women do so well, I think that, you know, to, to the other, I don't know your name, but

Speaker 3:          43:41          cat to caddies point, that embracing who we are as women is really important and really essential. And, and I agree. We don't need to change. Um, we need to be aware of how we present because the truth is the rest of the world hasn't caught up to our shed. Um, so we, I think it starts with an awareness, even back to Tammy Reese's Gmail Plugin. She's not saying, never say just her actually or I'm sorry. It's more of like an awareness of how we're communicating. Um, but I do think that women should be leaning into all of this skills that we do so well, which is we're great collaborators. Right? So even going back to that whole idea about networking, I've spoken to many rooms and I'll say to women, you know, who likes to network here? I mean, I can ask you all who likes to network?

Speaker 3:          44:26          Anyone like to network? No. So, okay, well you liked it. Well, you're really confident, authentic and good for you. But so many women don't like to now work. We feel that. It's like, it makes us feel a little like uncomfortable. You know, we're like asking for something and transactional and it feels very cold. Um, guides it had been doing it forever. Right? They go in and they say what they need, they're at, they get to be here, you know, they go play golf, done. Women don't like to do that, but we'll we're really, really good at is building relationships and we're really good at creating relationships that last a long time. We need to play the long game. So I would argue that women, we need to sort of rethink networking, thinking of think of it more even like relabeling that like we're connecting, we're showing up and we are connecting because women do that really, really well.

Speaker 3:          45:15          We bond very quickly. You put, you know, if we were all sitting together and like five minutes, I'd know what you all did for a living, where you lived. If you were dating someone, if you had a child, I might comment and you're like the coolest shoes that you're wearing, you know, whatever it may be. That is what women bond very, very naturally and very authentically. So I really do think it's almost re imagining what networking is and realizing that we're building sort of relationships with one another that are real, that are authentic and that we know will last awhile.

Speaker 6:          45:49          Folks. I'm sorry if you have a question, if you can use the two mikes just so that the sound is picked up properly.

Speaker 2:          45:54          Thank you.

Speaker 6:          45:58          Um, I think, I mean obviously it's true that like I think we have it right and I think we are aware of that like of the issues that women face that like woman women aren't wrong for doing the things that they do and the way they present being warm is never a bad thing. Being kind is never a bad thing. But I mean I feel like we are in the very vast minority of people who are aware of this issue. And obviously you mentioned um, Hillary Clinton, like the, the vast majority of America is not aware that, you know, the things like not aware of the biases that we are aware of. So I guess like navigating through this world. Like, I obviously am not condoning that we should like change or anything. But you did mention like you wanted to say sorry because you felt like that was how you came off as warm. So a warmer when, cause I grew up people calling me bossy all the time because I was confident and I was able to say what I wanted without, I'm not being rude but in just a sense being direct. But how do you, how do you avoid that? Like what kinds of strategies? Like could you delve more into like other things you've tried as well?

Speaker 3:          47:07          Yeah, yeah, I do think that a lot of it, his facial expression. So the problem when I was told that I was Abrasive, I was actually working remotely. So a lot of my conversations were over the phone. So I thought I was being very direct. And My boss actually said to me, who is a woman? She said, I know that you're warm, I use smile. You know, you're very engaging in person, but you know, on the phone people think, you know, you're a little bossy. And again, like a man would never have been accused of being bossy. I was just direct. I thought, um, you know, we've got time, we've got 30 minutes on the call in out done good. They're not seeing me smile, you know, because it's on the phone. Um, but I do think so that personal, so what I have learned is I do try to smile a lot.

Speaker 3:          47:52          I mean, it's not a natural for me to smile. I'm, I'm thinking I'm probably now more aware of that. And I also think maybe there's also comes with a little bit more confidence and age also of just, I'm not feeling like I have something to prove, so maybe I'm not coming in, sit like, you know, like the bull in the China store type of thing, that I'm a little bit softer as I even speak. Um, but yeah, I do. I am, I'm hyper aware of how I present. And so my advice to you is smile, smile, warmth, and then say what you need to say. Be Smart. Never Hedge on being smart as none of us would do, I'm sure. But you know, you want to come across and make your points clear. There was something else that, um, that I didn't mention when I was talking that I think is actually really interesting and it goes to sort of the solidarity of the sisterhood in this networking and the change that I'm seeing and I write about and it's called the amplification effect, if you all heard of this.

Speaker 3:          48:48          Yeah. Right. Right on. So for those who don't know, I had read about this and the Washington Post that the women in the Obama White House realized very early in the administration that they were being, they were being ignored, they were ignored by the president and by pretty much everyone in the west wing. And they'd come into meetings and you know, the president never called on them for, for questions or further thoughts or anything like that. Um, or if they did speak up, their ideas were being usurped by the guy in the room, you know, so they made a point in all of a sudden, you know, like John Zoning that point. So they got together and they realized that they needed to do something about this and that they were going to amplify each other's messages. So if yes, if something brilliant in a meeting with the president, as I'm sure she has, um, I would then say, you know, as you said earlier and letting you know now the point is being owned by Yaz.

Speaker 3:          49:44          I'm emphasizing that the president's looking over it. Yasmina like, oh yeah, smart lady. Um, good point. And they started doing that. They started making sure that they were calling on each other and reinforcing the comments to make sure that the guys weren't stealing any of these ideas. But something interesting happened, which was that President Obama started calling on the women more, started inviting them to more meetings. They were visible, they made themselves visible. So this whole concept of amplifying each other is really important. And certainly not just in the west wing, but in the workspace, right? We need to be supporting each other. We need to be recognizing what we're saying, what our contributions are. And it's really, really helpful to have someone else do that for. Um, I don't know if anyone here read Jessica had bandits book. Um, and I'm going to screw up the name.

Speaker 3:          50:33          It's the feminist fight club is her, is her book and which is a great read. And she writes about having a boast bitch and that boosts bitch is someone who, by the way he, it could be your best friend, it could be your mother, it could be your sister, it's having someone be able to amplify messages for you. And I'm sure there's tons of studies on with Facebook likes and Instagram likes and you know what gets the most likes and all this kinds of stuff. But there, but there is something to be said when someone else says something about you or someone posts something like, oh I'm so proud of, you know, my wife for her, you know, her book was published that tends to get more likes. And if I actually put out, Hey, my book was published, you know, so it's the same sort of concept. So you have someone else. You have someone who amplifying the great work that you're doing in the workplace, and having that boast bitch is really effective. And I, first of all, I just loved the idea. Um, and I think it's very empowering and very much of the sisterhood that we need to be supporting each other.

Speaker 3:          51:32          I know I digressed.

Speaker 2:          51:36          Does anyone have any other questions? I think we need to wrap it up. Okay.

Speaker 3:          51:41          Thank you all. Thank you guys for inviting me. Thank you Google for having me. This is quite an honor to be here. Truly. I'm thrilled to have been able to speak at Google. This is really very exciting. Thank you.
