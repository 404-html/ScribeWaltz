Speaker 1:          00:06          Hi Dan. Dan's doing well. It's good to be here. I left. Austin was 75 degrees and now we're a little bit, even less than 70 opposites. It's good. I brought scarves, I got hats, all the things that we have supplied him with some Google swag. So we are really excited to have you here today. Derek, have to be here. Thank you for having me. So my name is Ashley [inaudible] and today I'm just so excited to introduce all of you to Darren k Roberts. Darren has an amazing story. Um, it's not conventional in any means. Darren is a Harvard Law School Grad turned NFL coach, yeah. Turned bestselling author and now he is a lecturer at the University of Texas at Austin where he actually started a center for sports leadership and innovation. He's the founding director there.

Speaker 2:          01:01          Yes, it's been fun and chase five little people ages seven to seven months. So

Speaker 1:          01:09          definitely. This is great. I'm glad to be here. This is a break from home. It's good. Good. So I will, we'll talk about a lot of things today. We'll talk about his book call an audible. Um, congratulations on your book. Amazon. It was one of their number one new releases. Sports illustrated said this is one of the best sports business books of 2017. Yeah, no big deal. Right? Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:31          it's been fun. It was one of those things, I don't know if, if people are like me where you have this Google doc and um, it's, it's been living for five to six years with ideas. And that was where I was with this book. I had been working on an introduction for four years and I finally just woke up one morning and told my wife, okay, six days a week, two hours a day, I'm going to write from three 30 to five 30. I'm gonna go to the same coffee shop, turn off the Wifi and just go. And she's like Godspeed. And we did it. And yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:04          it would be really to hear it is, it's like, it's actually tangible. It's amazing. And I have one too. It's my own special copy. Oh, did you read it before you go to bed at night? They do. Well, I've already read it and you know, I'll read it again, maybe after the stock and you can buy more copies if you need to. Okay. So I can't, I can't, you know, go through you. I got to go through and be better to go through me. Yeah. Better take what? I've got. Five college tuition, so Gotcha. We have to support the hammer. I understand. Um, so daring, I mean you've done a lot, but I also want to mention in his free time, Darrin also started in leads a nonprofit football camp four. Is it high school?

Speaker 2:          02:38          Cool. How's high school? High school students? So these are not blue chip athletes, right? These are high school. Try hard. I love Football Darin types. Right? Um, and we take them for a week, 40 high school students and in the morning it's a yoga and meditation and, and Ben, we play football for about two and a half hours. Then it's three hours of act prep. And we built a curriculum where we have taken the act math section and translated it into football examples. So geometry, we teach geometry and Algebra or using a football field as a grid. Um, and then at night we have a series of two workshops. So social media etiquette, dress etiquette, how to write thank you notes. And it's been a wonderful program. We've had 500 kids come through in the last nine years. So yeah,

Speaker 1:          03:37          it's really nice to know that you know, you are giving back to commit to the community and teaching practical skills, right? Yes. The academic piece. But also what, what should you wear, how can you present yourself in a way that is the best reflection of, of you

Speaker 2:          03:50          and one like the social media class. Oh Geez. So I will go through all of their, so part of the application process is they have to list their social media handles. And then we have a team of people who we scrub all of their handles platforms and take screenshots of the good, the bad and the ugly. Oh Wow. And they don't know what's coming. And so on day four I of just walk up and I'll have this dummy slide up about, hey, how to make a speech. And then slide two, we'll be someone's post where it's nothing but profanity and you know, drinking a beer like, hey, who is this? And everyone's embarrassed. Oh my gosh, I can't believe you would do that. So now hold on, there are 2 billion people out there on some form of social media, why would you be embarrassed? Right. Um, and so we start there and then kind of work through how they can present a good image online.

Speaker 1:          04:45          That's great. I think with, with technology and with all social media, it's so easy to just write something or post something. But if you were to actually sit like in a stage and have the whole world, I'm maybe you would say that maybe your students or other folks wouldn't actually.

Speaker 2:          05:00          Yeah. And you know, all the research right now is showing that so much of what we do online is, is subconscious. So they're showing people tweets, posts that they've liked or shared and asking them if they recognize them. And the rate's around 25% so you're just scrolling, scrolling, scrolling, scrolling, scrolling like here, hard here or there. And it becomes sort of stream of consciousness. And so really for us, we're trying to get the students to be more intentional and deliberate about their move. Right? So when you hit the heart button, we say for employers or other schools, that is an endorsement. So you need to think about, do I want to co-sign on this message? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          05:42          And this is all in his free time, right? So in addition into the fourth and one football camp, um, Dan also leads a industry leading podcasts and he's also the chief of the Doughnut Council, which is calling me my favorite part of this talk. And we'll tell a little bit more about

Speaker 2:          05:58          that later. Um, and like I mentioned in some of the comms that you might have seen before, we will, I've promised them if it's okay with you, we will talk about Kevin Durant and we will talk about doughnuts. I love doughnuts. I can do that. Good. All right. Done. Is that all right with y'all? Okay, sounds good. So why don't we start at the beginning. Okay. You're a Texas born and raised. And what did you, you know, when you were a teenager kid, what were your dreams? So fifth generation, East Texan, what stood out? My Dad showed me this map of this Panola county where he's from and it was a census track from 1870 and there's a plot of land that has 153 acres and the name Bill Roberts and it's 1870 right? So he points to the map, he points to me and he says, this is why you will never have any excuses.

Speaker 2:          06:51          I'm like, what the hell is he talking about? Like I don't know. And then I find out that my great great grandfather finds a way to get 153 acres in a county that sent troops to the confederacy, right? Like how does, how does it has a black man in 1870 like how do you do that? And so my last book will be this, I want to present three different scenarios in a fictional way of like what could have happened. But that sort of set the stage for me of, okay, I got to pull the top off of my goals. And so I want it to be the governor of Texas by 40. Um, I turned 40 in November, so it took a wrong turn somewhere, kind of push it out. So everything was was um, I want it to be the governor. And so I thought that was undergrad government, pre law, law school practice somewhere run for Congress, like very linear, you know, if Aiden be, if he didn't see and uh, now my life is just like, you know, a sketchpad.

Speaker 2:          07:52          Well, I love it. I think it's just a different direction. But, okay, so let's, let's talk about law. So you want it to go to law school. Why Law School? Was it because you want it to be governor and then was, I know you kind of talked about Harvard, there was something about that school that really drew you there. Yeah, Gregory Peck had a lot to do with it. Right? So I, if I think about the imagery that really made me think about law school to kill a mockingbird comes to mind and seeing where this, this powerful figure being able to influence the community around him. That was one image that stood out for me. And then my dad bought a book of a, it was a biography of Thurgood Marshall. And just remember this image of him standing on the steps of the Supreme Court after Brown v Board in thinking to myself like, I want to be like that guy.

Speaker 2:          08:46          Um, and so everything was channeled towards law school. And I'm at the University of Texas, I'm student body president. I had great grades. I'm like, I'm just going to walk in to be easy, right? Easy, right? They're going to like, oh, we've been waiting for you for the last 18 years. Welcome, welcome, welcome. Finally. Right? And get the letter back. And it's the old wait list. Right? So it's we like you, we like some more people, a lot more than you, and you're like, how is this is like, you know, in the event that all of them tell us no, we may call you back, but if you have better options, don't wait for us. That's worse than a no. Yes it is. It is. Because it's like your clothes. I would, it's funny, at the time I thought I wanted to know, but in retrospect, I think the list was probably better because then there's like this little glimmer of hope I could somehow alter the situation some way. Um, but I wait list at four years in a row. So Gwen Roberts and my mom's like, just do something with your life. Right. Uh, I worked on the hill, I went to the Kennedy school and then the fourth year I got in.

Speaker 1:          09:56          And was it everything you imagined in more?

Speaker 2:          09:58          It was worse. It was worse. It was a hell no. I, it was good, but I like this. I was about to lie. I was, I do like blatantly lied to myself. I'm like, no, it was bad. Um, it's an interesting place, right? So you have 550 students come into a class and everyone's so high strung. You've got the folks who are just fresh out of Undergrad. So very going Berserk every single second of the day. The gunners on the front row hide worked for a while. So I was kinda chill. I had to make sure I got the Dunkin donuts for going into class priorities, priorities. But it was fun. I think I, I really enjoy being challenged and I did like the grind of like the one l first year, you know, in the library. He kind of steak a little bit. You're reading stuff, you're falling asleep. I liked that piece of it. Um, but I knew there was something, something else I should probably be doing my life.

Speaker 1:          10:56          And so this talk is all about risks and your story in itself is really interesting, right? To pivot so many different times. And I'd like to know it was your summer internship, right? Your first summer internship in law school. Tell us about that experience and how you felt.

Speaker 2:          11:14          So I worked at, uh,

Speaker 3:          11:17          you know,

Speaker 2:          11:18          name, ampersand, name, name, name, okay. In DC. And I remember the first day walking in,

Speaker 2:          11:29          working my way to my office and recognizing the fact that no one had smiled, right. Receptionist, you know, inserts first year, associate insert, you know, throw your partner. I thought, well, okay, maybe it's just a rough time, you know, that was the summer and the highlight was the highlight first day, this summer, this first year associate comes in, hey man, what are you doing for lunch? I'm like, I don't have any plans. You're going with me, right? This guy's not, hey, welcoming. We'd go to lunch. He's not talking to me. He's like, on his blackberry, it's 2006 was on a blackberry, you know, and, and I'm like, hey man, how's it going? We're talking. He's like, I just love it when you summers get here because we get our lunches, cops. Oh my gosh. So you heated it's recruiting, right?

Speaker 1:          12:16          He wanted you there, not necessarily to talk to you but to eat the lunch.

Speaker 2:          12:21          Yes. So then I thought, wow, the highlight of this grown man's life is a cot, summer intern lunch, like you're like visit. So I remember going back to law school thinking, okay then there's probably something else. And that's when my buddy the next year calls me to go to work a football camp. And we were both try hard players with like, there were no teams beating down our door in high school saying come, come play for us. And, but he was a football coach, a high school coach and he said, hey, come to the South Carolina football camp. So I get there and they need someone to fill in for a coach who hadn't shown up something they can play Texas football and I wonder what's going on. So I'll raise my hand. I'm like, hell, where do you coach? Like mount pleasant high school. It's like, all right, mount pleasant high school.

Speaker 2:          13:17          You have group six? Yes sir. I'm like, what the hell is he talking about? Groups six was 66th graders. Oh, okay. None of whom had any athletic talent whatsoever. Mom was, had taken them to academy to get like swooshes and they were protecting the house and they were doing it and could not back peddle like the length of this stage. Um, and they had a coach who couldn't coach best 72 hours of my life. And I just, there are these very brief moments in football where socioeconomic status goes out, the window was out of town. You live religion, like you're just trying to get 11 people on the same page. And I recognize for me that became a new form of public service. So I started though the journey to try to become a coach.

Speaker 1:          14:10          So I think many of us, I'm sure you might agree, oftentimes we have inklings to do things, we see certain passions, but what was it that got you from feeling that you love this thing and shoving it away as like, okay, that was a great 72 hour vacation and then turning it into something tangible and deciding you wanted to coach coach

Speaker 2:          14:33          football. So Renee Brown says, she says emotions are data and I could not get away from the feeling in my gut. Like, even when I left the camp, I go back to Cambridge. It was in my mind, it was this an easy in my stomach. And I've also just been up the belief, my dad's a Baptist minister. So if you walk into the Mount Olive Baptist Church on a Sunday at 12, 24:00 PM, Kurt Roberts is going to be standing up saying, you don't know when you're going to die. You better get right with Jesus. Right? And I think hearing that for so long, this just the delicate nature of mortality, like you don't know, we assume so much. I've always thought, let me try to pull these things and I'm thinking about putting off into the distance. I can let me make them, let me pull them into the present tense because I don't know if I get to retirement.

Speaker 2:          15:33          Right? And people are like, oh, just go practice. And then you can do that as sort of as a retirement job. I'm like, who says I get to retirement? Right? So, um, from that step I went into excel, which if this was 2018, I would've gotten a sheet. Um, and I went through every team in the NFL and I found their address and every coach on staff and I went through every bio and tried to find some connection. Are you from Texas and you're getting a letter from me. Um, you know, did you studied government Undergrad? You're getting a letter for me and I just wrote a letter, multiple letters to every team in the NFL.

Speaker 1:          16:14          So that's part of this. This is one of my favorite parts of this book and I'm going to read a piece of one of the letters. Dear coach and you sounded exactly like this, right? Yes, exactly. Your coach. I am a third year student at Harvard law school and I want to become a football coach. After just three days of working as a volunteer coach, I realized that changing the life trajectories of young men can be fulfilled by coaching a sport that I fell in love first in high school. I understand that you receive countless letters each year, but I promise I will work harder than anybody else you are considering for this position. And then you like went down and you said, you know, some other wonderful things and then ended with please just consider me for any entry level position you may have available. Yes. So what you sent this out to many, many more.

Speaker 2:          17:06          Yes. In My, you know, my last name wasn't Bella check and I didn't have any buddies like I had no, there was no end. So for me I knew the only way that I could break in would be to start at not even the bottom, like below the totem pole. And so what happened, you sent this, I said this and I got 31 rejection. So you know Bella, check Tomlin, you name it, going down the list, John Fox, all of these teams are saying no. And it gets to a point where, this is April, this is two months before I'm graduating and my classmates are going to the Supreme Court and the White House and insert banking and I bake here and I'm just waiting on one. Yes. And I finally get a call one day from a guy named herm Edwards who was at Kansas City chiefs head coach.

Speaker 2:          18:02          And he's like, Hey, this is her Matt woods. I need to talk to their Roberts. So I think it's a prank. And I'm uh, I'm about to say something that was, wasn't not going to get this job. I'm like, yes, sir. He said, hey, I don't open my mail. My secretary put this letter on my desk. What's wrong with you? Right? So I said, well, you know, nothing that's been documented. Uh, I worked this Cam, I'm telling me, they were like, yeah, whatever. Okay, here's the deal. He's like, take out a pen and paper, take off the training camp internally. Yes, no pay, right? It gets better, no benefits. And then he says 18 hour days. So I'm going back to employment law. I'm like, this has gotta be some kind of like 18 hours. He goes, are you in? And this three seconds sort of window.

Speaker 2:          19:00          And I knew I couldn't ask for any clarifying information. I said, yes, he's okay. Graduate from law school. Get here, hang the phone up. Right? So I drove June the sixth from Cambridge, Massachusetts to Kansas City, Missouri and a 2002 Chevy Tahoe that I still own because I'm cheap. It's also why I'm a planet fitness member. Yes. Um, yes, yes. Um, and I was the grunt. I was, I didn't sign a piece of paper in six months like I was, if you were to Google Darrin Robert's Kansas city chiefs in 2007, nothing would come up. I was, hey Darren, offensive lineman would say, hey, we need 40 barbecue sandwiches. Yes sir. I'd go downtown, get the salmon. Just bring it back. The defensive Lineman, hey, we need two cases of dip skull. Um, I go fine. I go to seven. 11 is trying to like as much dip as I could take it back.

Speaker 2:          20:03          I slept at Arrowhead for six months. I got a twin blowup mattress and I just wanted to be the first person, the first face that herm Edwards saw when he walked into the office four 30 every morning. I was right there and I was the last face. He saw him when he left at 11:00 PM. And how, how did you decide to give up law school? And I'm sure you know that life yeah. For, for this, yeah. I had a professor, David Wilkins who was a really great mentor of mine. I'm talking with him about the decision. He says, listen, when you get your diploma, what you won't find on it is an expiration date. He said, I'm just going to take a wild gamble here and say that

Speaker 3:          20:50          yeah,

Speaker 2:          20:51          when you leave the NFL there will still be the legal problems going on. So if you want to practice you can, he said, let me ask you this. How aware is this opportunity for you? So like how many times will NFL teams allow you to become

Speaker 3:          21:06          okay,

Speaker 2:          21:07          uh, coaching intern or train to get better. And so for me, I just thought that with every opportunity that I get, I think to myself, okay, one does it kind of flow in with my purpose? And that was an easy check. Yep. And then how rare is it? Like will this come around or something like it soon? And if the answer is no to that, I'm taking it now. And then just just adjust from there. So tell us more about that first year. Yeah, it good, bad. Yeah. Coaches wouldn't talk to me for two weeks. So I had all these coaches on staff who were former NFL players and you know, they paid their dues and they've got this dude who hasn't coached or played in college just around in the corner in a Hoodie. And they're like, what the hell? Who is this guy? Like why did you bring them on? But they sort of warmed up a little bit. First game we play at Houston, a part of my job is to make copies. So I make up a copy of the plane manifest for the flight and I see, and Robert's seat 40 d oh there you go.

Speaker 2:          22:08          This is on a Thursday, Friday chief of staff. Hey, get all the manifest, throw away, here's the actual manifest. We had to make some changes. 40 d no, Darin Roberts. So someone in the organization that you yanked my name, they thought that I had not paid my dues yet. Pretty high up person in the organization. Um, so I said screw it. I bought a southwest flight from Kansas City, Missouri, the hobby. I land in Houston. I know where the hotel, the team hotel is at Saturday night. I'm the first person they seem to get off her walks and he's like, dude, this guy here's like, what are you doing? He's like, were you on the fly? I was like, no. I took a flight. Hey listen, I don't want to be in the way. I'm just going to sit in the back of the room if you needed me.

Speaker 2:          22:58          He's like, we probably won't need you Darin, but just stay out of the way. They cool special teams coach. He's like, Hey, what are you doing? I was like, Hey, I took a flight. I could use you tomorrow because he had a lot. We had a lot of new players and I need to be able to find them when we go punt or kickoff, so could you help me wrangle players? I'm like, I could, but don't have any credentials. Can you kind of, yeah. He's like, let me do something by midnight. I had credentials by kickoff. I'm on the sideline and I'm in. And so I was on the flight from that point forward. But I think the point is like you really have to barge your way in and like a diplomatic way, right? In a non creepy way. Which in retrospect that probably was creepy. So you had to be somewhat creepy, but kind of find this balance. I don't know. I don't have like a nice creepy factor, right? Yeah. But I think it's so easy for us to send emails and think that we've done the due diligence. Like the email is enough and you need physical presence to separate yourself from all the other folks who are trying to get into this position.

Speaker 1:          24:10          Um, and as you know, today we want to talk about risk taking and certainly your story. Do you have tips for actionable things that folks listening and Googlers here you can take back to say, I have this inkling I really liked to do this. Yes. How can I get from there to something that could be my lifestyle?

Speaker 2:          24:32          Yeah. So there's some really good research that's shown that the Ikea effect. So who shot that? Ikea, okay. We've all done it, right? You walk in and you sweat, you smell those, you know, kind of weird meatballs and you're walking around and it's kind of odd. It's weird. Anyway, they're like halfway cooked and so everything looks so pristine and you're like, oh, everything could go into my apartment. Like I'll pick that desk. You get the box and then you go home. You realize you don't have any tools. Um, you never assembled anything since like third grade. Now building the Mongolian the volcano, if it doesn't go off, um, and you build this thing and it's a little wobbly and one of the drawers and really pull out, right? But it's yours and you built it. We're finding that this ikea effect and think about it as a sunk cost.

Speaker 2:          25:27          People think about the fact that they dumped so much time and effort into one course of action. They use that experience and that ownership to Ben talk themselves out of taking the risk. Right? Because I've worked at Google for eight years and I started here and now I'm there. I'm not going to take a chance and now become a chef, right? What we found is the way to get past that is to expose yourself to rejection. Okay? So I'm going to challenge you to put yourself in positions where people are telling, you know, okay, here's another technique or rejection resume. She write this down, write this down or tweeted, sing yourself or, or t mail it to yourself or something. We have many, many, many forms. Um, take your resume and under education list all of the schools that you didn't get into. Okay. Work Experience.

Speaker 2:          26:28          Every job you did not get, okay, go all the way down for awards and distinctions, all the awards and honors that you didn't get. Take it and then send it to all of your friends. All right? So I do some trainings with corporations and I'll have the CEO or CFO do this and then ask her to send it out. Right? And first they don't want to do it. Yeah. Okay. And then they do it and they send it out and it helps to humanize them and the organization. So someone was like, oh, I didn't get into Berkeley. Either it's great. Or Oh, I got turned down for the 30 for 30, you know, too. Right. So I think building this comfort level with rejection and was, and getting the no helps because you will document all of your big no's in life and then realize I'm still alive.

Speaker 2:          27:17          Yeah. Like I'm, I'm okay. And if I get a subsequent know from taking a risk, I'm going to survive because look at all the things that I've been able to withstand. So really going through and catalog and being very intentional about, hey, where at the time that I've gotten turned down or didn't get the big thing that I wanted and comparing that to, I'm still in a good position. Let me take that as confidence to go ahead and take more risks. Okay. Um, so in my class, my students, they go on rejection challenges. So to partners, so partners, you have to go to Starbucks and ask for a free drink, your partner videotapes you. Okay. And I had them do a pre write up in a post right up. And then we also take some risks seeking scores. Right? And they are so afraid. I mean, even the partner, like we've got the footage, can I am a Frazier?

Speaker 2:          28:09          The partner who's not even getting rejected, it's like shaking back there. Um, we take all the footage and then we splice it together and I show it to everyone in the class. And that's usually a pretty interesting day. But they go in, they get the no on a Macchiato, right? You could hear them trembling in their voice turn lane and then you have these great papers being written when they say it wasn't so bad, right? Like beforehand, I thought this was going to be the worst experience on the face of the planet. I got the, no, it wasn't so bad. I think I'm even willing to take a bigger risk in the future. So we're really doing a lot of research around can we help to build your rejection immunity by exposing you write to new strains of, of rejection. So, right. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          28:58          And so we, I mean, we're talking about you as a lecture and as a teacher now, right? Yeah. How did you, I mean you were NFL coach, student view, moved onto many different teams and then you pivoted again, right? You went from coaching in the NFL, which was another one of your dreams. Amazing work. And then how did you decide, okay, time to pivot. Let me take another risk. Let me teach.

Speaker 2:          29:20          Yeah. So that's, that's all Dylan Roberts. So I was in Cleveland. Is anyone here from Cleveland before I start making disparaging? It's like it goes out to the world. We have a card. Yeah, I know, I know, I know. So this is a place called Cleveland. Uh, so we get to Cleveland in 2013 we went four and 12, which as you'll know, is not uncommon for the Cleveland browns. And it was actually pretty damn good year. Unfortunately, the owner didn't agree with that assessment. And we play at Pittsburgh, we fly it back into Cleveland. The last game of the season I get a text from the owners assistant and it says, aiding him staff meeting. So we wake up and go into the office and the owner walks in and he says, Hey, really appreciate all of your contributions.

Speaker 4:          30:17          You're all fired. All right, good luck.

Speaker 2:          30:21          It's like go home and I'm scrambling eggs. And my son walks in and he's tugging on my shirt. I'm scrambling eggs thinking about like, where is the next NFL city? And he's tugging on my shirt. I'm like, what's up man? You eat breakfast? I'm like, yes. Scramble, scramble, scramble, Tuck, Tuck. I'm like, what dude? You mean eat breakfast? Right? So I turned to my wife, I said, Hillary, we are paying a lot of money for this kid to go to a private school and is it too late to get a refund or cause I don't see that something's not working. Um, my wife raised on a ranch in Kansas. She said, well, let me ask you a question. When was the last time you had breakfast with Dylan? Right? Oh, he's never seen you eat. Do you never see me eat? And I'm like, Oh yeah, it was, I could not pinpoint the time.

Speaker 2:          31:19          Right. So I have a breakdown. Eggs are burning. You've got alarms going off like man. And just the irony for me was that I had spent all of my time with other people's sons and my own son didn't know me, like did not. He was, he was legitimately surprised to see me with scrambled eggs and that was a problem. So I decided to take a sabbatical. Side note, if you ever take a sabbatical be equation is take the time you think and it's five x. Okay. You're like, oh I is going to be gone for a year. And then I'll come back four years later, I'm still on Sabbatical from coaching. But it's been great. I went back to teach, to teach at ut, some leadership classes, the ray rice episode on the foals and I take this proposal to our president for us to create a center for sports leadership and innovation, um, to be more intentional around how we teach athletes to become leaders, to manage their finances. And that was in 2014 and I present the proposal and he's like, okay, you're going to run it.

Speaker 5:          32:35          I said, I'm on some sabbatical.

Speaker 2:          32:38          So kinda like here, but not, he's like, no, you're running it. And December, 2014 we launched. So we've been at it for four years. It's been, it's been very, very exciting. I teach a class freshmen athletes at ut and we started with Bernay Brown's work around vulnerability and empathy, migrate over into Angela Duckworth and grit and Carol Dweck and mindset, um, have our failure management sequence where they go and do all these rejection challenges and then end with a leadership and financial management. And how many students have gone through this program? So I've had 850 students I teach. The great thing about the class, I think Ashley, is that we have half of the class is comprised of student athletes, half or nonathletes. Okay. So you have these two worlds colliding, you've got the receiver on the football team sitting down with this computer, you know, cs major. And one of the first things I do on the first day of class, I'll have the computer science major come up and put her schedule down on the board and I'll have the football player come up and do the same.

Speaker 2:          33:51          And you'll see football player 5:00 AM workout, breakfast, shower, you know, classes, lunch, practice tape, get to bed at 10 11 the Coder, the code has been up from like 11 to three working on code, sleeves to 10 goes to class, eat something around five and back the coding. Right? And so I say, hey look, the football player thinks, oh we have it so tough. You know, we have so much time that we're putting into our craft. I said, you've got folks who are coders and training. They are spending as much if not more time than you are. They just don't have 110,000 people cheering them on on Saturdays. So you're both putting a lot of time into your craft. Let's find ways to kind of bridge the gap between student athletes and non athletes. So it's been, it's been fun. They keep me young. So this, this pivot was more so unexpected, but it's something that it seems to be very fulfilling. Yeah. I think my life has now been, I'm trying to find ways to expand the worldviews of athletes.

Speaker 2:          35:06          Football players for example, I tell them you are mathematicians, right? Like four quarterback to throw a ball, 45 yards to avoid two defenders over the back shoulder of a person who's running a four three 40 down the sideline with the wind blowing 10 miles out of the West. That kind of precision, that is very complex math. Take that and translate it over into Algebra class. Right? And they see these worlds as being two separate spheres and everything that we're doing is trying to break down these barriers to say, you know, when you give the speech at halftime that helps your team to come back from a deficit. That's crisis management like that has an application in the private sector. Don't see it as, oh, I was just, yeah, exactly. This is what I would need to do outside of that. Yeah, exactly. So let's, let's bring those lessons for in any sport really, and translate those over into life away from sports. Sure.

Speaker 1:          36:11          Um, can you talk about your story about how Kevin Durant fits and all, all of this?

Speaker 2:          36:15          Yeah. So Kevin Duran, so Kevin Durant's, um, spent one year at the University of Texas was one and done and has such an appreciation for that time. Like, and when you talk to him, he looks at that one year sort of as the calm before the storm, right. And was a phenom out of Maryland. Um, in 2015 he started thinking about how he could have a better relationship with the university. And so we're having conversations with his agent and said, hey, how about you come to campus, make a speech? And he was like, no, we'd rather do a one on one conversation. And so we'd, we did this talk and we just talked through how much he loves mom, which I think is incredible. He talked about the fact that he thinks that there's such a deficit of love and people who are willing to be vulnerable and that he's trying to help people build a comfort level with that. Um, and then he, he talked about, hey, I want to find ways to be more supportive of what we're doing on campus for our athletes. And so he's been a supporter. Wrote a nice check to us. Yeah. You weeks ago. Thank you.

Speaker 1:          37:32          Thank you. It was a nice check it. Yes. $1 million that Kevin Durant donated to the center that Darrin founded. So big. Congratulations. Thank you. Appreciate it. And if anyone wants the magic, hey, tell us whatever. We got it all. I think there was a hand.

Speaker 2:          37:53          Yes. I got the little swipe, a little stripe thing. Um, so yeah, it's been great. We've been able to really read a lot of students and we're going to be a little more ambitious now with some of our offerings and we're moving into that period when we're scaling beyond the University of Texas. So

Speaker 1:          38:08          amazing. Yeah. Well. Um, I also want to let you know, um, we'll have some time for questions. So if you want to just line up at the mics, um, have a few more things to ask, stare, but please also feel comfortable to ask him anything you want. Take, take the risk, the risk, the pledge, Darrin. Okay. Now we talked about [inaudible] now our other favorite topic. Donuts, right? What is with you and Dona? Yeah, yeah. And what is with this doughnut council. So

Speaker 2:          38:37          I realize that I needed to be very intentional about spending time with my family and I think a lot of people say, oh, I'll spend more time on that family. And then that's on a Sunday and then you get to Saturday. Oh, I haven't spent any time with my family. Right. So I went into Google calendar and we haven't even talked to rehab it, we haven't actually course just kind of up a temperature level a little bit outside. Um, so my family is color code is orange and we have every Saturday, seven 30, I take the kids and we go to a different donut shop in Austin. And he said there were, how many? There are? 38. Okay. Is that more than New York? It's crazy. It's crazy. It's crazy. It's like, and what's happened, this has been going on for four years. My aunt, my mom does embroidery, so we've got tee shirts.

Speaker 2:          39:35          I mean we walk in and people are like, oh, doughnut council. Hey, copy a few, you know, donuts but should have posts how you asked for a free thing. That's right. Right. Yeah. And now it's gotten to the point to where my kids are becoming, they're kind of becoming snobs in the sense. Uh, my daughter last week, we're going to play, she goes, you know, cinnamon rolls here a bit dry. And which daughter is this? How is Sydney Sydney's five? I'm like sitting in your five, just eat the damn thing. It's nice. Like it's not as much as donut hole. They have us just eat. Um, now I'm spending a small mortgage. Right? It started out, oh, half a dozen donut holes here. Have Fun people want, you know, bear claws and chocolate sprinkles. So yes, our off three, now we have five. Um, and thank you long seven months.

Speaker 2:          40:32          And he's just trying to like get some of the residue from the donut hole, look at himself. But it's also a great time for accurate back with him around 11 so my wife can just go and be childless for a while. I mean, she works for a nonprofit and also helps with kids. And so she's, it's good to kind of give her some space, but we're at it for four years and it's been, it's been fun. So if anyone wants to donate to the donut council, half $1 million, half a million dollars, we'll go. We'll go a hell of a long way. Yeah. Maybe with the bear claws it'd be like, yeah, yeah. With the brick house. So now we're actually thinking, my oldest wants to make a pivot to breakfast tacos. So you got to have new embroidery tee shirts from grandma. We have bylaws. Um, I have veto authority. I'm one of the permanent members and yeah, self appointed. I'm not sure I feel about, I mean we are in Austin, Texas, right? So there's a, there's a breakfast Taco in every corner. Um, but it kind of seems a little different. Right? Different. It's not quite so, yeah. So it's been a great way to spend time with the kids and um, it'll be fun because my, my son was talking about, oh, when I have kids I want to do the same thing. So it'll be neat to see the grandkids doing that.

Speaker 1:          41:50          So I mean, the coolest part for me about, you know, hearing about the donut consultant, why I wanted to talk about it today is it's not just go eat doughnuts with dad. It's, you talk about real lessons. Can you share a little,

Speaker 2:          42:05          yeah. So we talked through current events. I usually pick a one current event and then I'll put pick one character trait. Right. And so a couple of weeks ago was gratitude and we talked about the value of saying thank you and I'll have them kind of think about, hey, when was the last time you said thank you? So Sydney, you can tell Sydney kind of runs the house. Sidney said she got an extra slice of pizza at school and she told the lady at the cafeteria, thank you. Right. I was like, well, how'd you get to act? Just like it because oh well she knows I really liked this cheese that they don't normally have. And she gave me an extra one. It's not dry. You know, she's very particular about our food. Um, and I say, well, how do you think she fell? She fell. She gave me a big smile.

Speaker 2:          42:49          Right? So we talk about how there are these things called soft skills that people talk about that's completely off their hard. And these are the skills that will get you fired. Hired governments, fall, country's fall, right? Like just truth and integrity. Um, so they're very important in their heart and we have to be very intentional about, you know, talking about them. So, um, yeah, they, they're really, now they had their own topics. Right now they're, they're starting to bring him to like, Hey, can we talk about movies and how we can get more time on the IPAD? And I'm like, no, it doesn't really fit in with the scalp veto power done. Right? Yes. Yeah. It's not a soft skill is fit. So it's been, it's been a blast.

Speaker 1:          43:39          So how do you, I mean you are teaching students and athletes how to take risks. Yeah. Are you starting to teach that to your children and if so, how are you doing that?

Speaker 2:          43:49          Yes, so I'm going to start this year actually to kind of going through the rejection resume. I'm gonna Start Broadcasting when I want to get turned down from things. So I picked, I've been going through a two weeks cycle with the Harvard business review, pitching them as article about Superbowl winning coaches and focus and how CEOs can do the same thing and got so close. And she finally was like, yeah, right. What's like I took a screenshot of the email. I thought I'd just put us out on social media without her information and say got turned down by Harvard Business Review. But you know what? It just helps me. I think the thing with rejection is you can't, you can't take it personal, but you have to make it personal in the sense I have to dissect the entire process. Did I give her enough time that I really flesh out the proposal?

Speaker 2:          44:37          Could it have been more succinct? And then use that for round number two. So, um, with them we've been talking about entrepreneurship and our home and so my kid said, hey, you know how you stuff all those Christmas cards, we want to start a business where people will send their unstuffed cards to us. Right. I've got, I've got like a legion right of hands and we'll stop at for them and uh, and mail them off. I thought that's pretty good. So my wife and I have talked about having some sort of entrepreneurial theme this year where we help them get something off the ground. Yeah. Well we can't wait to see what you do next and what your kids, certainly Sydney. Yes. Watch out for Sydney. You think we have a question?

Speaker 6:          45:24          Hey there. Um, so I have a thought that I haven't fully thought through yet and it just wanted to see if maybe something you've thought about, but how do you address like this, um, you know, a person or you know, whatever that's like coming, you know, acting like a person who is risk averse, but perhaps their risk aversion comes from a place of needing to be perfect. Or, you know, when we talk about kids and you know, I dunno when we grow up, we talked about practice makes perfect. Now I make a deliberate attempt to tell him my daughter, like, practice makes progress. But I feel like a lot of us were raised to think about being really perfect. And I feel like when I think about myself that I'm very risk averse. But I wonder if a lot of my risk aversion comes from this like psychology of being raised to try to be perfect. If that's something that you,

Speaker 2:          46:17          what was your name? Catty. First thing I want to steal that practice makes progress. So if you see it in another form and now I'm just taking it from you, it's yours. Secondly, so I was like Amazon last week and one of their 14, I hope this is okay. One of their 14 leadership principles is a bias for action. And I've adopted this massive action thing for the year. I deal with 300 freshmen a year. And the helicopter parent phenomenon is a very real thing where they land at the University of Texas and it's gotta be a foro highest honors President of this club in the right dorm. Like, you know, the, the color of the bed sheets have to be perfect. Like everything has to be perfected. So I'm constantly talking about them, talking with him about imperfections and, and also trying to get them to favor action and to say, listen, all you want is more data.

Speaker 2:          47:18          So if you wait to build this thing until you have it all, would you, will you think perfectly prepared? You have, you've kept herself from collecting the data that would've gotten if you were just throwing a Beta version out there. Right. And so, um, I think we do feel like, and I think it's sort of this Instagram culture of I need the right filter. And the lighting and the angle and then I'm going to post, we've taken that approach and sort of translated over into our professional lives and I'm a big believer in just throw something out there, get the feedback, go for version two. Um, because I think that's holding us back. We have tenure projects that could have been two year projects because we haven't been willing to put something into the marketplace and just let the market speak for itself. So it's a real thing. I think that um, the more that we can just say this doesn't have to be completed when I let go that I want to take that data and a and use it to make it better so they have a good point. Thank you.

Speaker 7:          48:24          Thanks for coming. Yeah, thank you. I'm curious about your choice to get into coaching versus something that might have been like a more natural fit with your Harvard law background, like front office type work. The goal was to do something really far outside your wheelhouse or if you did consider that and just that wasn't where the passion.

Speaker 2:          48:42          Yeah. So and it's interesting you say that your name again. Todd is interesting you say that because Todd, I had the coaches on my staff say when I first walked in the Kansas City, oh you should go the GM track. Right? Like [inaudible] you be a better, you know, better suit of GM. Um, I liked the challenge of starting something I play in high school like I said, but I didn't have any coaching knowledge. Right. And I liked the challenge of having to learn a new code. It's a language that was more exciting for me. Been sort of doing something that resembled a bit of what I had invested three years and I say like we need to, I'm constantly looking for ways to stay in over my head. And I thought that the GM track made too much sense. I really want to stretch my mind in a different direction.

Speaker 2:          49:36          And I'll tell you what, when you have, you have 25, 26 year old men who are 65, 240 pounds running four three, eight forties, you know, flat footed jumping 46 inches. And you have to tell them the routes to run on a certain play. Like it takes a lot of courage to look, look up at this guy and saying, this is what you need to do. Right. And I knew that was going to stretch me more than the office side of the job. And the last point is, what's ironic is it's made me a better teacher.

Speaker 3:          50:12          Okay.

Speaker 2:          50:13          Dealing with athletes for seven years has helped me, I think to be a fairly good teacher in the classroom. So, um, it was a thought, but then I sort of dismissed it and went for coaching. Yeah. Thanks Todd.

Speaker 8:          50:28          My name's Corey. Yeah, I got it. And a question. Yes. So if you're ever in Atlanta, checkout sublime donuts. Oh, best doughnuts in the city.

Speaker 2:          50:36          Oh, I would agree. We were, a few of us were just there, you know, he didn't call. Thanks. Look, you're getting me in trouble. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

Speaker 8:          50:45          Chin. Kind of this idea of like when you were talking about the illustration of the CS students and the athlete and these kind of two worlds combining with sports and the outside world. Yeah, I feel like we're in a place where there's very interesting things happening with sports technology and those kind of two fields together. So I'm wondering if you've seen anything happen on like ut campus or other campuses or your program is working with any programs to not only, um, get the technology into the athlete's hands to have them using it on the field or in practice, but also teaching them about the technology so they can get interested in it and maybe change it for the better to help future. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          51:24          Yes. So Cory, great first great tip and then on the sublime. And then great question. So we're actually in the fall we're unveiling a sports entrepreneurship sequence at the business school. So we're going to have 20 athletes, 20 non athletes and they will start it ideation all the way to, you know, putting the thing into the marketplace a year long course and we'll bring in sports entrepreneurs to expose them to, you know, this thing that we call entrepreneurship. I think you're spot on because it's, it's been relatively recent that people have kind of looked around and said, wait, we can test. Instead of waiting for the data to come back, we can just use the on the field data from practice and from training camps to inform the way that we build products. Um, and you actually have a couple of athletic departments that are considering building inhouse incubators. Um, so you see this with the 70 sixers for example, um, where they're just say, let's just bring this in house because we have world class athletes to get good feedback from, let's use this setting as a space where we can ideate and then test out new concepts. So I think this is really on the next few years that this concept we're really, really take off. Yeah. Thank you Cory. I was good. Let's go.

Speaker 6:          52:50          Hi Darren. Um, my name is Veronica and I am seeing in my field of expertise, which is employment law, that at the higher levels of corporate America, especially, you know, we're dealing with like c suite folks and the leaders in, um, the companies, uh, that the soft skills that you alluded to earlier directly contribute to the breakdown of and meltdown of workplace relationships. So in your talks and your trainings with those leaders, what kind of response are you getting from those leaders when you talk to them about skills? Like

Speaker 7:          53:26          vulnerability or,

Speaker 2:          53:27          yeah, so at first they walk in and it's, Hr has put this thing together and they've got to go get real mushy for an hour, right? So they own, they don't want to be there. And then we really, especially with vulnerability, first I'll show them the research that says for managers who score high on the vulnerability scale, their teams produce more, like all the things you care about, revenue and shareholder. All of those measures go up. And it's counterintuitive. But the reason is the team members say, Oh, if she has the confidence to be vulnerable and there are some limits, right? But to be vulnerable, it creates this safe space and they feel more comfortable and they actually produce more and better products and ideas and concepts. So at first have to get them to buy in that there's this, there's this very real bottom line benefit to being in using vulnerability and empathy.

Speaker 2:          54:29          And then I used that hook to then say, hey listen, it's also just good as a human right? Like empathy, the ability to take the perspective of someone else. If there is anything that's in short supply right now and our country in the world, like it's, it's to be empathy, right? Because we're all, we know the right answers. We know what everyone should be doing. It's a black, white, it's a very binary world and a lot of us live in. But to be able to stop and say, I'm not from the same hometown, we're not the same race or religion, but I can see how she would arrive at this feeling or conclusion. I think that's, that's important. It's an uphill battle though, I think, especially in corporate America, vulnerability, empathy or our Tufts sales. But we're working, let's take one last question and then you can come and stare at a few more afterwards.

Speaker 7:          55:24          My name's Zack. I'm curious, you know, in the two pivots that happen, they kind of came at natural points, I would say as far as you graduated and then maybe unnatural, but you know, you were fired or let go. Um, I'm curious, outside of that, how often do you kind of reevaluate where you are, whether there's something else you could be doing that would expand your impact and, and moreover, you know, you've done a bunch of different things. You've coached, you know, a group of say 10 folks and your and your 10 guys in your receiver group or whatever. Um, and now you're directing this big thing. How do you compare those different options and evaluate impact in all these different,

Speaker 2:          56:08          yeah, man, Zach and just got right to the heart of it. That's the process. Like right now, this is where I am. So I'll talk about staying in over your head. I am, I'm constantly thinking now, like, am I challenging myself enough? Yeah. Um, I, my, if I get comfortable, it gets a little, I'm on edge and I felt like I may be getting that point right. Um, I'm also at the point where I have determined for me that my life needs to consist of writing, speaking, and teaching. And if I think about the commonality between coaching and what I do in the classroom, it's the teaching piece. Yeah. That's the common thread. So now that I've identified that subset of what I need, I'm going to filter any opportunity that comes across my plate through those three. It needs to go three for three, you know, I'm going to be 40. I can't go to for three. I need a three for three set up. Um,

Speaker 3:          57:17          okay.

Speaker 2:          57:17          But I even don't know if I'm, if I'm really challenging myself enough right now. Yeah. Um, so I'm actively thinking about that and if you have some answers for me, I will take that. I'll pay you for them.
