Speaker 1:          00:10          Thank you so much.

Speaker 2:          00:11          Sure. Dave. Uh, I'm not the man of the hour though. These two are, we have, uh, the founder of ripple, Chris Larson, and we have it's current CTO, Stefan Thomas. Uh, we're very, very excited to have them. This is going to be an awesome talk. A little kind of brief intro. Chris got his MBA from Stanford. He started, he alone, which is a kind of a mortgage lender, a, it was actually the first platform to freely give out fico credit scores to its users. Uh, he started prosper, which is actually the first p to p peer to peer lending marketplace in the u s uh, and famously he cofounded ripple labs, which is a subject of today's talk. They're really excited to have Chris here. Stefan Thomas is a Cto, uh, of ripple labs. Uh, he was the CTO of, uh, numerous tech companies like e load and tech bear.

Speaker 2:          01:00          He founded, uh, we use coins which created this kind of bit coin primer video, which amassed 8 million views and was a primer for a lot of people to just learn about kind of the basics of bitcoin. And that kind of blew up on the web. So I'd check that out. Um, and he's a board of directors. Uh, he's on the board of directors, sorry, at the js foundation and he's a current CTO of ripple. Ripple is, uh, describes itself as the only enterprise solution, um, uh, for blockchain. Uh, it allows institutions to send money globally, uh, and a fast, frictionless and cheaper way. Uh, and it's broad. It's kind of broader. Uh, eventual aim is to create an, an Internet of value, which I'm really excited to talk to both of these guys about. A so without further ado, please, uh, give, give a hand for Chris and Stefan

Speaker 1:          01:51          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          01:55          Awesome guys. Um, so, uh, can you guys just give us kind of a brief bio, uh, in, in your own words, uh, your career and how you came to found ripple labs and then get involved.

Speaker 3:          02:07          Great. A habit to you at, first of all, thanks for having us and thanks for not making a Bart Simpson joke. I appreciate that. So, uh, yeah, as you mentioned, we've been in Fintech for about 20 years now, um, with kind of two startups previously. He loaner prosper kind of the common thread there. Those were focused on the consumer ripple. Obviously it's focused on enterprise and there's some learnings that I, that I had from that I'll share later. But the idea there was using the internet to democratize finance. Um, I think we did a lot of good there. Um, but we were always limited by just a fundamental lack of infrastructure in Fintech. So kind of in my view, Fintech, it really hasn't even started. Um, it has sort of been a stepchild of the internet boom, um, because fintech really has to involve both data and money and so far you've only had the ability to move data.

Speaker 3:          02:59          So there really both a lot of excitement, a lot of frustration that we couldn't go further at the same time. Um, it was always keeping an eye on what was going on with virtual currencies. And you know, Bitcoin, obviously it was a real breakthrough, but there've been a lot of attempts over the years. And so we were watching things like, uh, Lyndon dollars, which was currency and you know, uh, that kind of existed in the early days. Second life. Phil Rossdale kind of an amazing guy. He's still the coolest guy in Crypto, right? Um, you know, things like Vermont dollars, kind of this idea of local currencies in a very small community. Super interesting. Um, obviously beans and floors, which were too big, well funded projects during the first.com boom. That sort of, you know, failed spectacularly, but it just seemed like it was a matter, a matter of time before you'd have a global, a digital asset with no, you know, kind of government backing and no counterparty.

Speaker 3:          03:53          Um, as far as ripple itself, that route is actually go back to about Oh four. Um, there was, uh, something called the ripple project created by a Ryan Fugger, a Canadian, a gentleman, and he was just really a neat guy and he tried really to kind of give birth to this idea of a peer to peer. Um, platform for, uh, people exchanging their own credit and essentially their own currency. Every person would have their own currency. Super interesting concept. Um, that was a big part of what influenced us kind of fast forward to 2011 and there was these three geniuses that got together. Um, Arthur Breteau, Jed McCaleb and David Schwartz. Um, and this is of course after bitcoin was created a couple of years earlier. They were fascinated by what bitcoin did, but they were frustrated by the enormous waste of energy that is sort of at the heart of mining. That's a core part of, of, uh, of bitcoin. So they set out to build a more efficient consensus algorithm and they came up with something really beautiful. Um, they also were inspired by what Ryan figurehead head down at the ripple project and kind of also brought in that idea of kind of pathfinding algorithms so that anything of value can be exchanged along with that digital asset to really, I think that was kind of the, the, the, the birth point of this Internet of value,

Speaker 4:          05:13          the intellectual protocol, which we'll show in a little bit. Um, actually has, it's almost like an overlay protocol over blockchains but then also traditional financial systems and that allows you to innovate in different parts of the network independently instead of having the sort of central governance model where everyone has to agree to any, any rule changes that are happening.

Speaker 3:          05:32          I think this is like a critical point. I think we came to the realization that a blockchain was not going to be the solution to the biggest problem we think the world has right now in this whole Fintech area, which is there is no Internet of value. Um, and why block, you know, and a lot of people talking about bitcoin's going to be a new protocol for money. Well, just it's really a database, right? So it, a single database or a single network cannot be the network of networks. And so that was kind of the big flaw and that's what led to, I think, you know, Stefan having this kind of Aha moment of need for something like Ilp,

Speaker 4:          06:07          which was a dangerous moment for, it was scary at first. It was like we were trying, we were out there promoting this acid, like Xrp, like telling everyone, hey, you should put all your balances on this ledger. You should do all your transactions through this one system. Um, and we knew the friction from that. But then again, like stepping back from that and suddenly saying like, oh, they're going to be many systems was very scary. And so we actually, uh, waited almost a year to publish the white paper until we had, um, you know, in our minds of result of strategy around what's extra p his role in this new world and how do we make sure that our technologies are still needed and it's still necessary and can, can benefit this new world. Like how do we re architect everything to serve this new world? Um, so I think we're still in the process of like rolling out all of the different pieces. Um, but it was that sort of one year period from, I would say, um, you know, mid 2014 when we first had that realization to October, 2015 when the white paper for intellectual came out, where we tried to kind of put all the pieces in place for it because we have rip, it always was different from big

Speaker 3:          07:09          going in that you could put anything of value in it, right? So this idea of kind of, we'd call it IOUs or balances, but really being value agnostic and that then being the engine for, for the exchange of that thing of value. Um, but having the combination of IOP with Xrp, we think that's the, that's kind of the, the killer formula.

Speaker 4:          07:29          No, you can have any type of failure like any currency, but also any type of ledger. So like anything from a centralized ledger to

Speaker 3:          07:35          chain, et cetera. And if we look at kind of stepping way back, kind of the macro problem that we think in the world has this lack of an Internet of value. Um, you know, you kind of argue that this gets to the heart of the problem with globalization, which is obviously under a lot of stress today, right? It's kind of not working for a lot of people and we kind of, we don't think of it as like, well, globalization's bad. We think of it. Globalization is actually incomplete. Until you have an Internet of value, you really can't have true globalization. You sort of need these three core interoperability technologies working altogether. You need interoperability of data, of goods and money, right? So the world today, of course has interoperability of data. You know, it's completely transformed the world over the last 20 years. It has interoperability and goods through, you know, a simple thing called the shipping container, which you know, before that was in vantage shipping stuff was incredibly inefficient and labor intensive stuff would arrive at one point I had to be ripped apart and reshipped and with a shipping container, you know, your shipped to train the truck, any port in the world, you have interoperability goods since the 1950s.

Speaker 3:          08:37          That's Sorta what an Internet of value is. It's like the shipping container for value. And again, that can't be a blockchain. And blockchain is like a single shipping company that will, you know, you'll max out that shipping company and you'll have a dependency on that one. Shipping Company, shipping container, you can create endless shipping containers. It has no effect on any other shipping containers that deployed. That's sort of what Ilp is almost the ultimate decentralization. So that's kind of what we're, how we're thinking about it

Speaker 4:          09:02          or the technique people in the audience as a stateless protocol. So you can literally just run it over different systems so it doesn't keep any balances, et cetera.

Speaker 3:          09:10          And then we think we're really good things happen when the world finally has a full kind of globalization platform. Um, but this has to happen. And, and again, what w what does this meeting now that we don't have it right now? It means, uh, you know, we all know, send him 50 bucks to Europe is kind of impossible, right? Yeah. Um, we know, I think the example of the air bnb host in Tanzania who should be making 29 bucks to on a rental. And by the end of the day is nine bucks is showing up. This is an actual example, right? Um, so that's a, that's a problem with relatively big amounts of value. Think about, uh, the 2 billion people in the developing world. They, the gates foundation would say they need to be able to send 50 cents, uh, to be real participants in the global economy. Take that even further. If you think about all the connected devices and applications that probably should be empowered to sand value, that might need to be, you know, a thousandth of a penny a, that's just not possible until you had this internet or value in place. So the world is being held back by this and we think that's the true breakthrough that this whole, whatever you want to call this industry really is all about.

Speaker 2:          10:19          There are some detractors of, of ripple that say it's kind of the centralized block chain or the enterprise blockchain. Uh, you know, a lot of bitcoin loyalists and bitcoin in general might have come out of kind of a, an anarchist or a cipher punk kind of movement early on as part of that. Uh, um, and uh, and so that, that's kind of the general criticism. So I wanted to give you guys a chance to respond to that and then I'll combine the second question because Stefan, as an awesome presentation he's going to give the second question is we are living in a crazy kind of environment in terms of crypto currency. Just speculation on, on the price of, of, of Tokens and blockchains. Uh, what do you guys think? We're in 1999 right now. Is this the, the, the uh, you know, kind of a.com bubble that we're experiencing? Um, so yeah, those two. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          11:10          I'll take the first one. You can. Sure. Um, so first of all, the enterprise part I take as a compliment. I think that's precisely what we're trying to do is we're trying to build the first blockchain that can actually be used for real, you know, real use cases. You know, like when you think of any distributed system, we need to take a distributed systems class. The first thing your professor will tell you, it's like your distributed system is still only going to be as good as the nodes that runs on. And so if you think of bitcoin miners, they're only incentivized to basically hash as efficiently as possible. They're not incentivized to provide physical security for the data centers. They're not incentivized to make decisions in the interest of the network. Um, so the, the, they have a very pure incentive to just hash as much as possible get paid, um, rinse and repeat.

Speaker 4:          11:52          In the case of ripples, since the validators are chosen by the users. If a validater for example, votes against a block size increase or something like that, if there were an issue in, in ripple, um, then you would eventually find that users would no longer add that validated should that list. And so that validated would slowly lose influence. Um, and so it's not as much of a system that's like tailored to users like bitcoin is where, you know, anyone can just run a node and it just auto configures itself, um, connects to the network. You do have to do that validators selection manually. You have to think about, you know, politically speaking, like, which validators do you want to empower with your note, et Cetera. Um, so it is more targeted at like, you know, actively being managed by companies, things like that, things of that nature.

Speaker 4:          12:34          But I think the reason that that makes a lot of senses because when you actually go out there and to the market, um, you know, the, the evil people, you know, you mentioned I'm an anarchist, you know, so I, I really want to, uh, empower people, right? But the people that you got to fight or not the, like all the banks there, there a few, you know, very, very powerful players in the market that, that sort of take a little bit off the top. And those are the people that you want to bypass. And then everyone else, like there's a lot of small banks and regional banks and so on that we've talked to that are really trying to provide better user experience. You're really trying to provide lower fees, et cetera. Those are the companies that we want to work with and empower and it's not just banks, it's payment providers, mobile money providers, um, and so on.

Speaker 4:          13:14          So that's kind of where that different approach comes from. And on the centralization point, I would kind of say that there are a lot of different definitions of centralization and you know, we're sort of going down the list of meeting more and more of them as we progress. Um, one of the ones that we don't meet yet is that we still run a majority of the trusted validators. Um, but that's something that we're, this year going to start rolling out in terms of, um, we have already got a lot of third party validators running, so people are going to start trusting in this year. Um, and so this just one more step to kind of go in that direction. And I think if I compare it to where we were with Bitcoin, like with Bitcoin, we had some level of decentralization. Again, meeting some of the definitions, but not all.

Speaker 4:          13:55          For instance, there's no geographic diversity. It's very concentrated in China right now. Um, but we didn't have a very good roadmap in order to how to overcome that because the, the system is really, um, you know, it's just sort of the incessant centers are set up in a, in a, I would now say bad way. Um, whereas with ripple we have the incentives are in order. And so it's just a matter of like, you know, validators having the riot, the, you know, amount of operational histories of people who actually start trusting them and us having enough confidence in the software to actually, um, you know, continuously let go of more and more of the reigns here. So I think it's, uh, uh, for ripple, it's a clearer roadmap to get to a very high level of decentralization. So bottom line in decentralization is there's kind of a bright line, you know, if rebel did not exist with the network, continue to function. Yes. So that's kind of that, you know, hard line of which side you're on. And then I think it's definitely point variety. We can agree deviations from there. And then

Speaker 3:          14:52          a second I think on what's going on in the market today. So obviously, you know, it really interesting, you know, the time in, in, in the space, clearly there is a lot of UB speculative interest that's going on. And I kind of break that into kind of two parts. Um, one, uh, is there's clearly a lot of, of almost like crypto day trading going on. It's almost like the days of the early Internet with all the, the day trading. And I think it'd be probably, if you look back on most people that were day trading back in 2000, um, I bet it didn't work out that well for, for people that were doing that. People shouldn't do that. You could lose all the, you know, you can lose everything. Um, it's, it's just not a good plan. People should not be putting the retirement money to work day trading cryptocurrencies.

Speaker 3:          15:37          And then I think there's a lot of skepticism that you, you know, you see out there, uh, Nathaniel popper, for example, the New York Times, you know, he writes, uh, uh, about that, uh, skeptically and he's right to be skeptical. So we think, you know, that people should be very careful with that. But there's a second part of speculation I think is being now increasingly driven by institutions. So institutions, funds, we would call it the Wall Street tidal wave is sorta coming, uh, coming into play here. And I think what's going on there is that a very sophisticated people are saying, investors are saying, look, there's some meaningful percentage of this is in fact a second internet and this internet or value can be as transfer transformational. That's a longer term sort of call that that's going to happen. Um, so I'd say that's more constructive speculation.

Speaker 3:          16:24          And I think those institutions and those kinds of professionals, they've seen what's happened in this last, uh, 20 years of the net. The great promise, the overhype, uh, the, the, you know, the total bubble, the crash, and then kind of fast forward 20 years where we are today. If you look back, you'd probably say probably the early promise was probably, it was probably under hyped given the impact that all of this has had on human existence. So that's a more constructive, uh, view. I think they use cases for industries, enterprise payment providers and other things that is coming on board. Um, so I suspect that sort of ratio of sort of hopefully the longterm specularity of injury, you know, activity and the use case, it starts to look more like what you see in normal markets because this thing's gonna actually work pretty constructively together.

Speaker 3:          17:16          When was the last point in that I think interesting is in the first internet that kind of started with institutions, vcs and then Wall Street and then kind of went on to sort of this day trader, you know, dynamic that you saw this kind of the reverse of that actually kind of started with individuals and now the institutional wave is coming on board. So that's a little bit different, uh, you know, kind of flavor. Um, but definitely think the world's never seen anything like this before. So it's trying to grapple like what, what are the metrics, what is it you compare to visa, you gold? Is that the first protocol that can be monetized? Lots of new questions. Awesome guys.

Speaker 2:          17:50          Really appreciate it. Stefan's now going to give, uh, an awesome presentation about what's in store on the technical side for ripple. And then Chris Christmas going to stay here. Someone's going to come back and we're going to do a little Q and a with the audience, so take it away.

Speaker 4:          18:03          So what this is trying to illustrate is, um, if you deploy into ledger on some network, and we envisioned that there will probably be sort of a global instance of it. Lists like the Internet has a global instance. Um, then you have these different nodes, these, these little blue notes here and we call them connectors, but they're basically like routers in Ip. So they basically taken packets on one side. They look at the destination on the packet, they compare it to the routing table, and then they forward that packet towards that destination. Whenever you look at any kind of blockchain presentation, there's a pretty good chance you'll see some kind of graphic that has, you know, nodes connected by lines. Um, some kind of graph and, uh, you know, you'll hear things like bitcoin is the TCP Ip of money. And when we hear that, we cringe a little bit because if you know anything about how TCP IP works and how bitcoin works, there are very different protocols that do very different things in a very different way.

Speaker 4:          19:02          Um, and so the challenge that we always have when we talk about the interledger is it is actually a lot like TCP Ip in and then through this little presentation, I want to try to convince you as to why I say that. Um, but, uh, you know, people already have usually like seeing some kind of blockchain presentation had already looks a lot like this, um, but, but is a little bit more superficial in terms of the similarities. Um, and so if I want to send a packet into this network, I just send it to whichever connected I'm connected to and it should find its way to whatever receiver receiver I've put on it. So in that way, it's a lot like two CPIP. Now you might say, okay, so you were routing these packets, but how does actual money really move? Um, so the way that that works is that once you have sort of a, a path and you're sending these packets, each link is responsible for its own settlement.

Speaker 4:          19:53          Um, so what we tend to do is, um, if you have two connectors that have, um, a peering relationship with each other, they're going to have this like pay packet traffic going back and forth. And so they're going to look at those packets and then they're going to eventually settle. Um, and for the core of the network, it makes the most sense to settle through a digital asset. And the reason for that is that they are very easy to move internationally across borders and you have very low costs in terms of when you move them. Um, and since you are going to have a lot of inbound and outbound traffic, it's makes sense to stay in that digital asset, to do all of your settlements. Um, but of course the majority of, of people, users out there don't actually have easy access to digital assets yet.

Speaker 4:          20:35          Um, and so you do need some kind of a, some form of support for traditional payment systems. And the interesting thing is that all these settlement networks really do is, you know, move payments across or like move money. And so, um, that's something that is supported by all the legacy payment networks. So we will, we can actually do is we can just aggregate to a greater degree so we wait a little bit longer before we settle. Um, and then we send a one big payment across. You see that kind of at the beginning here with the sender, a down there and the receiver and upright, um, where those, those settlements are happening a little less frequently and there are a little bit bigger and to probably a little bit more expensive, but they can settle lots and lots of these individual packets. Um, and so with this architecture, what that means is that from an end to end perspective, we can send a packet at incredibly low latency.

Speaker 4:          21:23          We can send it, I'm an incredibly low incremental cost. And so that's really what makes it feel a lot like the internet. You can really just connect to lots of different services and pay for lots of different things without accumulating a lot of fees while doing that. And then sure, it has a settlement eventually. And you know, hopefully these a last mile sort of settlements will get more efficient. Just like internet connectivity. It went from you know, 56 k modems, uh, all the way up to what we have now where I have a Google fiber. So very happy with that.

Speaker 4:          21:54          Um, so yeah, here's a little chart of like the actual architecture and again, if you're familiar with TCP Ip, you know, they draw the same kind of picture with the four layers, um, which is, you know, sometimes called the Internet architecture. It's a little bit less detailed than the Osi architecture, but I won't bore you with that. It's just a reference for the people that didn't know that. Um, so the four layers actually work a lot similar to the very similarly to the four layers and TCP Ip. So I just want to go through those four and kind of give you a sense of how this all works together. Um, the way you should think about the interledger layer is that's essentially an abstraction layer. So that's basically the thing that you have all the different ways of moving money below it. And then you have all the different use cases for moving money above it and it kind of brings them all together.

Speaker 4:          22:41          So in the case of the Internet, it would be the internet layer, um, has all the different ways of moving information below it and all the different use cases building on top of it. And so now you can have all these different combinations. I can make a Skype call over my Wifi, I can make a, you know, send an email over my satellite internet. So it really doesn't matter what use case I'm using and which network I'm on, I can combine them in different ways. And so this is kind of doing the same thing, uh, for money. Okay. Now an application layer, uh, this would be sort of the equivalent of like http SMTP. This is use case specific. You would make different application layer protocols for different use cases. Um, so one that we've designed so far is called a SPSP or a simple payments, separate set up protocol.

Speaker 4:          23:23          Um, and basically all that does is it defines what a internet, it sort of identify it looks like. So think of that like an email address. Um, and you could send to that type of identifier if you wanted to pay somebody as on a peer to peer basis or you could build that into simple apps. It's not super efficient. So it's kind of like HDP or it's sort of the general purpose application layer protocol. Um, you could make a much more specialized ones. So for instance, we did an experiment where we built payments into web torrent. Um, so basically to pay the uploaders, um, but also the content creators, uh, which I think is really cool aspect of this. It's like it's efficient enough that you can pay a lot of different parties in the flow of whatever app or interaction that you're, you're part of.

Speaker 4:          24:04          And we'll see a demo of that in a bit. But I think this is where I expect a lot of variety is on the application layer. Now we're talk about the transport layer. So if you're familiar with TCPI, if he does this, where you find your TCP and TCP is really common to a lot of different application layer protocols that build on it. And it gives you some sort of basic services, right? It gives you a sequencing of packets so that your data comes out the right order. Um, it gives you a retransmission if a packet gets lost, it'll send it again and so on. And we have a transport layer protocol called PSK too. And it does a lot of the same things. It's a responsible for doing things like if you send a large payment, it'll split it into smaller chunks and then reassemble them.

Speaker 4:          24:44          It'll do things like retransmission of payment packets, et cetera. Um, so again, like I'm trying to really get across, like we're copying from the Internet a lot and we have to um, give, uh, give them a lot of credit, cause a lot of the things that they do actually apply to money very well. Now the interledger layer is, um, is kind of an interesting one because that's where all the routing happens. And when we first started out, I'll tell you one anecdote about the design of this layer, which is when we first started out, we assume that the writing would have to be quite different because we're talking about money after all, we're not talking about information. Um, and so we, you know, we knew about BGP and how it works and so on what we thought, a lot of those things wouldn't be applicable.

Speaker 4:          25:24          We want it to route by the lowest cost path. We thought that that was the most important thing was, was to minimize the fees. But as we actually building it, we realized that, um, if you optimize by fees, what can happen is somebody in the network just advertises a absurd, right? So they just advertise, hey, I can exchange $1 for 600 euros now that suddenly the best path to take for absolutely every payment in the entire network. Now what do you think is going to happen? So that note's going to go down, obviously that right was never real to begin with. Um, and so you just, the whole thing just breaks down. Um, and so one of the reasons for the way the BGP is design is to make the length of the path one of the primary metrics. And what that does is if someone advertises some ridiculous metrics, you still only going to take down his immediate neighborhood because for everyone else is still going to look like a big detour, a very long path that they don't want to take.

Speaker 4:          26:14          Um, and so it turns out that even for money, the length of the path, it's a very good proxy for all the other things you might be interested in. Like how reliable is it, what's the latency, what's the fees? Those are all lower or tend to be lower for shorter paths. And so we can do exactly what BGP does in terms of routing by shortest path first. And then I'm using other metrics to kind of tie break if passengers same length, um, picking the best one. Um, and we just basically add fee is another metric. Just like the incident has latency. Um, I already kind of talked a little bit about the settlement. The key thing to mention here is that all we need from the settlement layers that it can transmit money. It doesn't have to be very fast. It doesn't have to be very cheap.

Speaker 4:          26:52          If it's slower, we just settled less often. Um, and just to give you some examples of the kinds of things we've integrated with already, um, there's a extra p patient plugin, so that's settling using the extra ledger. Let's see it most efficient at plugin right now. That's one of the reasons that we feel good about the strategy. It's like we actually seeing in practice that our own products score really well on these different metrics. In terms of like what ledger would you actually choose for settlement? Um, we've done a lightening integration, so we did a little test where we actually connected the bitcoin lightening network and the light coin lightening network together. If you're not familiar with lighting, it's basically a scalability overlay network for, uh, currencies like bitcoin. And then you could do something like Ach. You can even do cash if you want, right?

Speaker 4:          27:35          So you can have a relationship with an intellectual service provider where it basically says like, I give you cash up ahead of time, or you give me cash ahead of time and then we can exchange packets up to that amount until we reached that balance. And then, you know, we have to settle up again. Okay. Now with all that, um, prefix, I'm going to give you a bit of a live demo and this is going to go fairly quick. So pay attention. Um, so, uh, basically what we're going to show here is, uh, the easy website maker. Okay. So easy website maker is an APP that somebody put together, just uploaded it to get hub. And basically it allows you to create a website from just having a little sketch. And now obviously we didn't build all the difficult parts, the AI parts of what that's what you guys are for.

Speaker 4:          28:18          Um, but, uh, we did do all the payment stuff, so all the payments are actually going through until ledger. There's actual payment packets being exchanged. And we tried to visualize that a little bit later by having like a log of packets. Um, and basically what this APP does, this I put in a sketch and it, it goes to one vendor that's offering a, an API, a paid API that can turn sketches into actual html. And then it'll go pay another vendor to actually package that into a docker container and upload it somewhere. And then, um, another vendor to host the actual live website and then another vendor to buy a domain. And finally we'll tip the developer. So I'll go show you what that looks like. So the first thing you need to do is I need to pick my sketch. So I'm just going to grab one here.

Speaker 4:          29:03          And so this is the sketch of my website. There's probably a little bit small to see, but it has like some tax and it has a little chart and it has some more texts. And just to be clear, again, like the AI is mach. Dot. We didn't actually create the AI just for the demo. That would be ridiculous. Um, but uh, yeah, in the future, this could very well be possible. So now I'm going to say make my site and now things are gonna happen very quickly. So it's going to upload that sketch to that Ai, sorry. Done. And now it's uploaded the finished html to get back to a service that turns into the docker container. And as you can see on the right, and I might do the demo twice as, so you can see it again, I'm on the right, you saw the total amount paid.

Speaker 4:          29:39          This is in a XOP drops us would be 1000000th of an extra p. So a total paid would be 0.1 XRP um, which is about, what does that like 2 cents, 3 cents, sorry, two, $3. Nobody sends point. What a, sorry, 2010, that's like, yeah, it's like 30 cents or something, whatever. Um, so you could see like the individual packets and there's a couple of things going on. Um, and I think I will run through the demo again just so you can see. So first when we paid that Ai, um, we paid a sort of one lump sum amount and then the packager is actually a streaming, uh, paid end points. So that's a paid end point where as we sended data and we ask it to do things, we'll stream packets to it to keep it paid. And if we ever don't keep up, it'll like stop working until we pay it more.

Speaker 4:          30:26          Um, and then we deployed it to a host and bought a domain and then sent a tip to the developer. And I can actually click this button here and I look over here and as you can see, our website is now up and I can actually show you, it's like all of this running locally, but uh, we got a domain, et cetera. Right? It's like set it up. Um, so let's go through a demo one more time just to, so you can see kind of the, the streaming payments part a little bit better. So I'll pick the web, the same website. So you're on a ride. You can see like total paid right now is 500 drops. It's to pay for the AI. Now we're streaming to pay for the packager. So does this going in 258 drop intervals and then we have a large expense to host the website.

Speaker 4:          31:08          Um, 9,000 drops. That's over 9,002 to actually buy the domain. And then finally we tipped the developer a thousand drops. And so if I make an APP like that, I have a built in business model and I think that's really the, the key point to get across here is I think this will have a huge impact on the web where think about if I start a convenience store, I don't need to think about what my business model is. My business model is people pay me when they come buy things. When I open a restaurant I don't think about by business mom business model is people pay for the food that they eat on the Internet. We have this weird thing where like there isn't a good way to charge people for using your website. And so we build advertising, we build subscriptions and all kinds of hacky work arounds for like how to get money out of people just from visiting your website. And I think this will present a pretty efficient alternative, um, in the future where people can just pay you for, for the, for using your site. So that's it. And again, back to this. Thank you. Thank you. Stir fry.

Speaker 1:          32:06          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          32:09          now we'd like to open it up to questions from you guys. Does anybody have any questions? Thanks for the presentation again. Um, yeah, so there's like a lot of different coins that deal with payments, like a repo light coin, stellar for example, that I've heard of. Uh, can you go like a little bit over what's the different, like the basic differences between all those different payment platforms and then also do you see like one payment platform just dominating and we all just use one of them? Or can these somehow like live in harmony, kind of like USD and euros and whatnot?

Speaker 3:          32:43          Yeah, maybe I'll do good. So on the second part, um, I think it's going to shape out a lot. Like what you're seeing with a few currencies. I mean, you know, the world kind of has four majors, maybe five majors, and then there's kind of a, you know, um, everything else. Um, and I think that probably plays out here simply because, um, particularly with this sort of Wall Street wave that's coming, a lot of those institutions, they're not buying how many, 2000 different, you know, kind of coins and imply platforms out there. There's sort of grab and I don't know, top 10 or five or it's some smaller number and you know, in currencies, liquidity begets liquidity. All of this is about, uh, how much liquidity, uh, is kind of, you know, kind of supporting these platforms and these and these, uh, these currencies or commodities, wherever you want to call them.

Speaker 3:          33:35          There's still a lot of debate on what they actually are. So I suspect that's going to accelerate. And you and, and that liquidity then it attracts more use cases. Like for example, ripple. The company focuses on the enterprise use case. But you know, we see these things we see Xrp is, is very much a general global digital asset. Without a counterparty. So, uh, you know, you'll see more and more use cases popping up from different angles and that just kind of drives more liquidity. So I think that's probably the way it might be, how it pans out. But

Speaker 4:          34:06          yeah, I think the reason we developed into ledger and the reason we built an interoperability protocol was because of that exact realization. It wasn't going to be everyone using one system. There was going to be a number of different systems. And actually behind that as another realization, which is, you know, my goal has always been, you know, to solve the problem of, you know, friction and payments. Right? And so, um, I realized that the centralization wasn't necessarily the solution because you see a paypal, they come out, they have free then eventually to check up their fees when they have an established market position. But then you see bitcoin doing the same thing, not necessarily with us as much slit of agency, but it still happens that way. And so what you got to think about is right now when you're on a payment network, you can only send money to the people on the same network.

Speaker 4:          34:53          Um, and that's kind of like pre Internet online services where you could have like compuserve and you can email anyone on compuserve and you can, you know, use any services that are uncomfy served, but you can't access any services that are on genie. Right? And so compuserve has this like moat, they have a defensibility around the reach. And so that's really what you got to commoditize what you got to attack. And so with payments, it's still that way today where like if you're on the same payment network, you can pay each other. If you're on different networks, you can't. Um, if you want to pay from your paypal account to a mobile money account in Tanzania, you're screwed. You can't, um, yet I can totally go on my mobile phone in Tanzania and open any website in the world, right? So we need that kind of interoperability.

Speaker 4:          35:35          And that's really what creates a competition that drives the cost. Um, the reason we think that Xrp is going to have a role in this system is because, um, we've been doing, I mean, not to toot our own horn too much, but like we, we've been doing really well in terms of like the performance and the characteristics of the protocol. So I think a lot of people will choose to use Xrp if there is sort of a lot of competition was like right now you use bitcoin even though it's expensive, you use bitcoin even though it's slow. Um, I think if there's a lot of competition, people will pick the most efficient, which would be extra p right now.

Speaker 3:          36:06          You know, that as well. It's kind of in an environment where a lot of the volume I think is speculative. I actually think that kind of use case has a greater tolerance for costs. Speed kind of doesn't really care. Right. Um, whereas as you started getting into kind of these use cases where you need like, you know, millions of some kind of unit, um, that matters a ton, right? So as the kind of the ratio of a real use cases to speculative volume changes, I think that dynamic becomes more important. True. I'm sorry. Next question. Cool. Thanks. Thank you.

Speaker 5:          36:42          Uh, Hey, uh, thanks so much for coming. Uh, my question is around, so if you're talking about that Xrp and cryptos are the Internet of money, the big difference between money and data is that money's regulated and banks certainly, you know, if they were the like the equivalent of running the phone lines before, I have a pretty big incentive to uh, innovative and sort of get ahead of a change that that is coming. So you could see them easily upgrading the swift protocol to be able to move money internationally a lot quicker. And so I'm curious how you guys see specifically XRP living in a more regulated space. I think, you know, the crypto sort of took the world by storm and governments are going to certainly respond the next year or two. So why do you think that Xrp is going to be able to live in a much more regulated industry than data is? Uh, especially because like, you could see banks upgrading swift to be able to support, you know, maybe like submitted transactions instead of, uh, transactions that take days.

Speaker 4:          37:41          I want to like quickly question some of the premises in there. Um, so I think a lot of the people in the room I think are very young and so we grew up after the deregulation of data. And so like the Internet came out and a lot of the laws that were around before then, copyright law, you know, cryptography laws, uh, export restrictions around algorithms and things of that nature, you know, actually got removed and are safe harbors got created because the internet kind of post the technology that was on the one hand, very useful. And on the other hand, kind of an illegal gray area. So I think that um, the technology, this if you use it, it just feels so incredible useful that it's hard to imagine how regulations wouldn't be built around it. Um, I think that there's definitely an opportunity for people to be thoughtful and intelligent about how to, how they approach the technology in the meantime. Like you want to be compliant, you want to do, uh, everything that you can to kind of, you know, stay within the letter of the law. But there are going to be a ambiguity is in terms of like just the law is not written for these kinds of use cases. So, um, I think that's one thing. And then as far as like extra Pto, I think I'll hand it off to Chris.

Speaker 3:          38:49          Yeah, I mean you're raising a, obviously a key part in has, as I mentioned before, the Internet of value is kind of equal parts, uh, capital technology and compliance compliance is hugely important. And the reason is simple. I think it's just because governments sorta want to have a monopoly. I think it's actually a more, a question of, you know, data is powerful but money's more powerful, right? Um, you know, data can show you, um, you know, a life saving medicine that your family might need it, can't buy it. Money can buy it. On the flip side, um, you know, data can encourage a terrorist to do something awful. Um, money can buy the weapons, right? So the stakes are higher. Um, which I think actually this is going to have maybe a more profound effect on earth, good and bad. So regulators have got to be there every step of the way.

Speaker 3:          39:35          This fantasy that somehow this is going to bypass governments and bypass compliance. You know what, that's just, that's just bs. And you know what? Nobody wants that. Nobody wants that. That is a champagne problem with a bunch of rich young people that can sit there behind their computer screens and like block out a lot of bad things that can happen. So it just can't go that way. Um, and so I think we're trying to think about that. Try to be pragmatic about that. Cause that's the only way we're going to have impact. And if you look at people that are trying to support what's going on in the developing world, um, they are very much wanting to work. They're not trying to go around, they're trying to work within the system because they know that's how you're going to have impact. Um, so that's, that's kind of the way we see it.

Speaker 3:          40:18          Your question about swift by the way. Um, the, the problem with that point of view is swift only deals with the data. They have a correspondent banking partner that deals with the value and that's off any sense of an Internet of value. The whole point here is that, uh, something like interledger and Xrp can eliminate the correspondent, which is actually where all the juices, right? That's where all the waste is. That's where the sediment risk is. That's where the failures are. That's where the time is. So swift actually doesn't have the, the combination of capabilities to do what you're saying. Right. Cool. Sorry. So thank you for the question.

Speaker 4:          40:57          Uh, that's a pretty cool demo and I just want to learn a little bit of a behind the scene that, for example, the Ai, how the full building an AI, how the money goes to the Ai Chat Bot. Okay. Um, so we built a protocol that kind of takes intellect, juror on the one side and takes HDP on the other side. And essentially you're making rest calls. So you're making API calls to these back ends and the first time you make the call, they all respond with four oh two payment required, which is a sort of an error code. An HTP two was already, we were like, great. That works for our use case. And um, basically it sends you back a header to tells you all the information that you need to know to make intelligent payments to that exact, um, and point or like the Api server that runs that end point.

Speaker 4:          41:46          Um, and so that server will be listening for intellectual packets in addition to the http requests. Um, and so when you start paying, um, yeah, it'll go back into that same receiver and then the receiver will then a credit year, what we call like a token. Um, and then the next time you make a request that has in the header your token. And so the receiver will know that you've actually funded that with some packets and then you will, you can proceed through the, through the program. Um, the streaming version of the demo to you saw a, that's a little bit more complicated. That's probably goes bill beyond, but we can maybe catch up about it later. Um, and then, uh, one, uh, one thing that's also interesting is that one of the services, which is the thing that builds a static site into a docker container actually itself pays another Api, right? So you have another API behind that. And so one of the things that's really cool is with these streaming payments, we can actually have sort of an API that takes in money, um, in an immediately spends it assets trying to process that request and then maybe sends a little bit as profit to the developer and then returns the results. So this is a lot of cool stuff you can do with it.

Speaker 6:          42:50          Great. Thanks. Thank you guys for coming to speak today. I'm kind of curious to learn more about how you might, uh, prevent money laundering and, uh, companies that participate in, uh, you know, um, uh, you know, like the payday loan type, uh, companies from coming on the system that exploit people financially. Um, I'm interested to learn more about that, that sort of thing. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          43:20          So, I mean, I think we, um, we really try to focus on, you know, kind of the bottom of the payment stack. So kind of on the infrastructure part of it. Um, and are we going a reason for that is that a lot of the things that prevent bad things from happening or kind of top of the stack and a lot of that actually doesn't need to be reinvented. Right? And, uh, the way we kind of think of it as like, let's focus on what's really changing. And we think this is the interoperability. It's the idea of a digital asset with no counterparty that can be spending anywhere in the world that's neutral. So those are the things I think we can, we can, uh, can change. And then piggy back off of this is what we like kind of the enterprise focus now is for that as that first beachhead, um, you know, piggyback off of what already exists for hundreds of millions, uh, you know, uh, people.

Speaker 3:          44:07          Um, the other thing I would say is that if this Internet of value becomes a reality, I think, you know, the prevention of things like payday lending, obviously it has to be regulated. That's a big part of that at every level. But the other big thing to what Stefan mentioned before is sort of the commoditization of reach. Um, if you have that, you suddenly now every market has way more competitors, uh, for financial products. And it was something we saw at prosper and Isla and we got frustrated with because we were kind of us in one lane. You couldn't, you couldn't transport it to another market because you were in another network. Right. That this future vision I think is that the world is one big financial supermarket and you know, everybody's competing in every market. I think that goes a long way, but you still need all the other, you know, kind of regulatory components. Uh, pretty much existing at some may go away, but I'd say probably most of them don't. I don't know what you want to add to that, but

Speaker 4:          45:02          yeah, I think like with, with uh, you know, you mentioned the anti money laundering, I think there's sort of a long list of things that are actually completely separate issues, right? There's sort of consumer risk. There is, um, any money laundering there is, um, uh, yeah antiterrorism finance, like there's all kinds of different things. So you have to think about when you're building a, a payment system. And so if you have a stack like this, they'll fit in different parts of the stack. Like for instance, consumer protection that would fit in the application layer. So if you're building an application where consumers are sending money, you have to think about, you know, how to protect those consumers from sending it to the wrong people. If you have, if you're thinking about risk or counterparty risk, that would fit in the sort of the ledger layer, right?

Speaker 4:          45:44          So you have a counterparty, they settle with you on a certain schedule. How do you make sure they actually settle with you? Um, so there are a myriad of things to think about. Um, I think that it's kind of a losery for us to come up with all the solutions. I think we're trying to be thoughtful in terms of like getting it to a point where we can start experimenting with it and, and kind of get more experienced with it. Um, but that's gonna require sort of a commercialization of the technology to really think about, you know, all of those use cases. Um, and I would also highlight that, um, you know, ripple has a commercial, um, uh, you know, stack and commercial feature set, and that is very much like Chris said, you know, writing within the existing regulatory framework. And then we have the open protocols, which are maybe a little bit more forward looking. And I think some of those questions are more difficult there. So what you saw us present today is the more forward looking stuff. So I think some of those questions are still open there.

Speaker 7:          46:36          Great. Thank you very much. Thank you. Hi. Thanks for the presentation. Um, so since the tech is currency agnostic, um, why, what would be the incentive to choose XRP over fear or any other cryptocurrency? Hmm.

Speaker 4:          46:57          Um, so this is where it almost love to like ask my colleague up on stage cause um, you know, we have our team who was actually trying to integrate with these different digital assets and you know, different payment systems and it's just a like a, like an many orders of magnitude of difference between extra and let's say bitcoin. Um, and still several orders of magnitude between extra p in something like light coin, which is known as a more efficient, so acid and like, um, it's just a pleasure to work with. And part of it is it, it's been designed for that, right? Like it's been designed to be used as the settlement acid in, into ledger and so, uh, has a lot of functionality like payment channels built in a certain way, um, that are incredibly efficient for this particular use case. And so, um, I think the big answer, the main answer is right now it's just the best thing to use. Like we talked to people, Hey, let's, uh, set up a connector. Well, what do we peer with? While we could use light coin but what we could use extra p but x people just to be cheaper. So let's use XRP. Um, and so I think as much, uh, to the extent that like these connectors are going to be competing with each other and they're trying to think about their margins, experiential is going to look like a very good option for them. Yeah. In this world

Speaker 3:          48:09          you'll just, you'll need some digital asset that is super fast, super cheap, endlessly scalable, um, that will serve the world very well, right. Better than let's say using a dollar or using a euro, right. Something that is a neutral to any network. So we're absolutely confident that some digital asset, uh, will be a key part of this Internet of value. But we think that sort of fast co, you know, cost and scalability are going to be those key things and that's what's going to drive the liquidity that's going to make these things really useful.

Speaker 4:          48:40          Yeah. Like extra p is not static either. It's like we're constantly thinking about how to help improve it. Um, there's a community out there. It's thinking about how to improve it. So, um, you can expect that it will get better as well as, as, um, you know, time goes on. Final question. Hi. So I was still, uh, in the very beginning of your presentation about how you think except piece better over bitcoin in a sense that bitcoin is a lot slower, a lot more expensive, but um, but is there for a reason, right? Cause it requires like at least six confirmation across the network in Warren Person's action to happen and, and that is their invoice would address the double spending problem. So I was just curious, like in your own words, how does that Xrp addressed it that will spend problem if it's just a confirmation between the two notes.

Speaker 4:          49:27          Yeah. Yeah. Um, so if you're not technical please, you know, do something else for a little bit. Um, cause there's no way to answer that question without getting into some of the technologies. So, um, bitcoin users or consensus process, which is essentially based around the assumption that a majority of hashing power will never be held by a, you know, a coordinated, malicious attacker. Um, and so if you're watching what the majority of hashing power is doing, you'll tend to be on a state of the network that is reasonable and it doesn't contain, you know, reverse the transactions and so on. Um, however the protocol as such does allow rollbacks, right? So you can, if somebody else presents you with a chain that's longer, it has more hashing power behind it, you will roll back your transactions and switched to that. And I know that because I was one of the first person people to implement a full node bitcoin re implementation from scratch.

Speaker 4:          50:17          Um, so I wrote that code and it's very complex and knowing code to write. So I will remember that forever. Um, on the ripple side, such code does not exist. There's no way to roll back network. Now how is that possible? Well, the way that ripple works is, um, as I mentioned before, the user select these validators. Um, and then we essentially use that input as a, um, as an input to sort of an algorithm where we look at the graph of what people selected and then we run a consensus on validators that are central to that graph or like that are highly trusted within that graph. And so it's sort of this two step process. And what that means is that when the first step is complete and you'd try, you've identified which validators you're looking for, um, you don't have to worry about there being like more hashing power just over the horizon.

Speaker 4:          51:04          Like once you hear from the validators that you've identified it as being the ones that are validating or like the ones that you, you're listening to, um, then you don't have to worry about some other validate are coming in later saying like, no, actually we decided this. You just didn't hear about it yet. And so there's no need to roll back or to, um, to rewrite history. One smell. It does have committed to a decision. They can't change their minds essentially. Um, and so that has a couple of, um, impacts where like a couple of ways that the protocol is different because of that. Number one, you only have to wait for one confirmation. You wouldn't wait for multiple confirmations because values can change their mind. You can't roll back. So there's no probabilistic aspect to it. Um, number two is, uh, we can, um, process or we can create blocks on the cadence so we can create blocks and like a, a fixed interval as opposed to a random interval like bitcoin where, you know, blocks can come out very close together. They could, there could be no block for a long time because we know which validators they're supposed to generate blocks they can generate them on that cadence. Um, and then, uh, finally

Speaker 2:          52:06          I think that'll cover everything. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          52:09          yeah. Whatever it is, there's a really good talk on, um, why shouldn't call it real good, but there's a talk by myself

Speaker 2:          52:15          on consensus.

Speaker 4:          52:17          Um, but you can find out from the consensus thousand 17 conference where I go into a little bit more detail and I'm also happy to talk to you afterwards, but that's kind of the high level quick description.

Speaker 2:          52:26          Cool guys, thank you so much for coming. Uh, do you have any final statements or do you want to tell people how they can get involved in the rebel community at all?

Speaker 4:          52:38          Yeah, so for interledger there's intellectual.org, um, which at the time of recording this horribly out of date, but hopefully by next week should be showing you all the latest, greatest stuff. Um, there's a community group at the w three c called Di intellect, your community group that's open to anyone to just register. Uh, we have a mailing list where we discuss, you know, how these protocols work together. Um, all the code for the demos and everything. Um, you can find that on github.com/intel Ledger and slash into ledger js. Um, and then for ripple ripple.com if you're a bank, you know, let us know. Reach out if your payment provider and we've maybe if worked for Google payments or anything like that, let us know. And then, um, for, there's another project which we didn't really mention today. Um, but that's also, uh, was also using the demo in the background, which is called Codea. So that's basically the hosting a system that's paid within to ledger, and we uploaded the website to it. Um, there's a lot of cool use cases around hosting if you're thinking about serverless hosting, et cetera. So if you enter that, there's codis.org as well. C O d I s.org. Awesome. Chris, Stefan, thank you so much for coming. Really appreciate it.
