Speaker 1:          00:05          Awesome. So my name's Kelly shoemaker. I'm the head distiller for hanger one. Um, we're up in Alameda, California on the formal naval air station. So just up the way, I'm actually relatively new to California. Um, I moved here to join hangar one about three years ago from Denver, Colorado. I actually started distilling it. Stranahan's Colorado whiskey and Denver go Broncos. I like that shirt. Um, so I started my career in whiskey and the time that I spent making whiskey really had an opportunity to learn pretty much every aspect of distillation, everything from tours and tastings to grain selection to mashing, fermenting, distilling, barrel maturation, bottling. Um, there's so many awesome aspects that go into making delicious, delicious beverages. Um, but what I have the opportunity to come join hangar one here in the bay area. I was really excited. Hangar one is a brand that's really well known for using fresh ingredients and partnering with local farmers to source those ingredients.

Speaker 1:          01:03          And that was, that was something that, uh, I found really exciting and trigging and that would be a great challenge. So here at hanger one where I am now, um, we working with our local communities and local farmers is pretty much at the center of everything we do. We source grain and wine from local folks. We work with farmers throughout California to source the fruits in botanicals for our flavored vodka and we even get some water from our friendly neighborhood fog for fog point. But you know, we'll talk a little bit more about that in a bit. Um, part of this collaboration with local suppliers, uh, leads to partnerships with like minded individuals. So Chris is with me here today. I'm Chris from fog quest and uh, he'll talk a little bit about fog and fog water and how we use fog to make vodka.

Speaker 1:          01:50          But what, what we're going to touch on today is a few things. We're going to talk a little bit about innovation and Vodka, um, innovation and distilling. And our most recent innovation at hanger one fog point thought go. All right. So before I get too crazy talking about fog point, you guys probably would like to know how vodka is made, right? A lot of people have this perception of a VOD could be in a spirit that's vodka because it comes from potatoes. This is not actually the case. Vodka can be made from just about anything. If it can be fermented to create alcohol, it can be made into vodka. So their grain vodkas out there, there's corn vodka, there's fruit vodka, there's even a guy making vodka from milk, so people get really creative with it. Um, basically the way to make vodka is you start with your fermented material and then you need to distill it to 190 proof hundred 90 [inaudible], 95% alcohol.

Speaker 1:          02:41          It's pretty spicy stuff, right? Um, the idea is to reach towards a clean, odorless, flavorless profile. That's actually in the federal definition. Um, we don't want it to be 100% odorless and flavorless what have a nod to our starting ingredients and put a lot of work into sourcing really good stuff. We want you to be able to taste it. So the 5% that sneaks through it with that 95% alcohol, it's going to carry through a little bit of character from our starting ingredients and it hangar one that's mid western grains and California wine grapes. Um, so you guys just saw a picture of this still behind me. We've also got a photo right here. Distilling in a nutshell is the act of boiling are fermented material, so we're using California wine grapes. In our case that's wine and as we boil that material, the alcohol portion of it has a lower boiling point than the water, which means that the alcohol steam is going to rise up off that solution before the water allowing us to collect it and condense it back down into more pure liquid alcohol.

Speaker 1:          03:37          Now you see this still behind me. It's got a lot of little windows and things on it. We have to get to 190 proof. It's pretty important part of being vodka, so that doesn't look like a whiskey still. That's specifically a vodka still. The reason it is specifically a VOD Casteel is because the towers next to the pot eat contain a series of small chambers. That's what those windows representatives, small chambers and an Asian, those chambers, the vodkas forced to go from a liquid to a gas to a liquid to a gas each time leaving behind more water, leaving behind impurities and making its way to the collection tanks at the end, at 190 proof. Now distilling is what people think about when they think about making vodka, right? Distilling is the most important part. Um, crazy thing is if we're distilling up to 190 crew, if you guys want to drink it at that high of approved, right, it's, we have to have water.

Speaker 1:          04:21          Water is actually 60% of vodka. We're going to have water back into our body to bring it down to that bottle strength. So there's actually more water in your alcohol than there is alcohol. A lot of the times, another fund fund, the party fact you can share with your friends. Um, so for most of our vodkas are straight vodka on all of our fruit bod coast. We're using reverse osmosis water. Reverse osmosis water is so clean that it allows our ingredients to shine. It allows all of the different nuances and the flavor profile of these awesome ingredients we're using to shine and uh, through using our oh, water, that, that was one of those things that started to, uh, inspire me to look at our water usage and uh, make something like fog point. I'll get there in a few though. I was talking about our fruit and our wine and that's been one of my favorite parts of moving from whiskey and moving from Colorado to California is our collaboration with our local farmers.

Speaker 1:          05:11          When I first got here and I saw all of the really interesting produce that's at the farmer's market year round, it inspires us to continue to make new vodkas and our, our partnership with those farmers as we do this is so integral to everything that we do. And the drought has had a huge, huge impact on our farmers. So this is a really important time for us to talk about water and drought and the water cycle and its impact on everything we do in California. So the drought officially ended in March. I know the rain was terrible and we're all very tired of it, but it helped us to get out of this six year drought cycle that over the course of the last six years has caused a lot of impact on California. For example, last year the drought caused California $3 million and 102 million trees died over the course of that six year drought periods.

Speaker 1:          05:58          So that's a little bit of the impact globally, but the farmers are really paying a heavy price. Um, on this drought it's, it's important to remember that California is an agricultural center for the US and it's our biggest agricultural producer. There's more than 200 crops grown in California. So drought and farmers definitely go hand in hand. The thing that I kept hearing as we were talking with our farmers is we're sourcing our fruits for our VOD cause it's how the drought is impacting all of our fruit quality. And our fruit availability. Plus it's impacting me because I need water to make my pocket. Like I said, they're 60% water and vodka water adds to the overall character of what we're making. So the final package of a vodka is that distillate. We've distilled up to 190 proof. Any process that we do. So any infusion or mass aeration of our fruits are botanicals if we're making a flavored expression.

Speaker 1:          06:46          And then of course water. The characteristic of the water is going to have a huge impact on the final, final product. So the good news is we're talking about water and these water issues is that here in California as a community, we like to all innovate as a group to find solutions to these problems. So individuals, businesses, we're all committed to chipping in and making our state a better place and helping sustainability. So would you tried to do the same thing at hanger one? Um, as a group we started looking for a new, more sustainable source of water. What's a way that we could talk about this issue? Raise awareness for the water crisis we were having during the drought and make a really tasty vodka at the same time. That was our end goal. So we searched for all kinds of different processes and in that search, uh, someone from our team came across fog quest.

Speaker 1:          07:33          Now Fuck, this is a nonprofit that works worldwide to collect fog for agricultural and drinking water use. Uh, they work in countries like Gla, Nepal, Guatemala. It sounds really cool and we realize that fog is so iconic here in the bay area. The solution for our water issue was actually right in front of us this whole time. Right? The question is, could we actually use fog to make vodka? Sounds like a really cool idea. Is it actually something we can do? So we decided to reach out to the experts at fog quest. So Chris here is that a local thug expert? Chris has been volunteering with fog quest for the last four years and he has been instrumental in this project for us. We've actually learned so much, um, visiting the fog collectors with Chris and learning about how fog is graded in California. And, uh, how's a way that we might be able to collect it? So Chris, tell us a little bit about fog please. Excellent. Oh, hi.

Speaker 2:          08:25          Like Katie said, I'm a volunteer with the charity fog, west sustainable water solutions. And a fuck [inaudible] mission is to provide water to people in remote locations using fog. And right now fog quest has, uh, projects in eight countries supplying significant amount of water. Nope. Like Hailey said, they brought me here to explain a little bit about the fog because it's, it's kind of bewildering and, uh, want to try to explain how this mechanism works. And the first thing, first question I want to answer is, you know, what is the fog? And out here in the bay area, the most prolific kind of fog that we see as the fog from the ocean, that puck comes off the ocean and that is technically called a advection fog. And advection means movement. And so the way the fog is generated from the ocean is warm air moves across the cool ocean.

Speaker 2:          09:17          And as that air is cool, it Ho it cannot hold as much water. So the air becomes super saturated and then as you're cools, even further water droplets are forming. So that's the mechanism for generating fog, for generating ocean fog. That's, and this ocean fog is the starting point for fog collection. Uh, in most areas. And in one area we're fond quest has the largest network of fog collectors. It's in a remote village in Guatemala. The advection fog is the starting point in this village of fuck quest has around 35 large fog collectors and that occupies a collection surface of around 15,000 square feet. So that's about a third of a football field vertically posted like billboards. And those collectors produced around 1800 gallons of water a day during the dry season. Uh, this subnetwork by fog, fog quest, it's a minimalist network. It's designed to be rather inexpensive.

Speaker 2:          10:23          And also it's a passive technology and so it doesn't require any energy. And so for the people, this one village, the fog is a very positive aspect in their life. Now out here in the bay area, people have a little more mixed feelings about the fog. Sometimes the fog will cause traffic delays or airport delays. But also during the summertime, the fog can cool off an entire city or an entire county. And so if you think about it, for the fog to have an impact over a square miles, there's a lot of energy in the fog. There's a lot of cold water. It's just difficult to acquire that water.

Speaker 2:          11:02          So hope that helps a little bit. Now the pro, the process for fog collection is pretty straight forward. What has to happen is fog has to be blown through a, through a mesh for several hours and then, and then water is trapped on the Mesh and it's eventually collected in a tank. So how does, I want to explain a little bit more about why this works and uh, the starting point to understanding why this, why this system works is I can explain a little bit more about fog. And the most important aspect of fog is that the droplets and fog or microscopic, there are about 100 times smaller than a raindrop. So raindrops, their trajectory usually is vertical. They're falling, they're falling from the cloud to the ground. Fog droplets tend to float, they move horizontally. So any fog collectors will be posted in a vertical fashion to try and maximize the fog going through the material. So the process, like I said, is it's pretty straight forward. Uh, fog droplets impact the mesh then may get trapped and they stopped moving and over time the mesh becomes waterlogged and then larger droplets fall from the Mesh into a trough and then into a collection tank. So basically what these fog collectors are doing is they're converting the small microscopic droplets and fog and the larger droplets, which weekend down, plumb into a tank.

Speaker 3:          12:31          Okay.

Speaker 2:          12:31          And one tool that fog researchers use is called the standard fog collector. A standard fog collector is, uh, can measure the fog collection efficiency in a particular area. Uh, and last year, uh, with, for s for the fog, Bob could project, we mainly use the standard fog collectors. Also, the researchers are commonly used them. And from June through September, this one, small fog collector average, uh, over a gallon a day, pretty stove or a gallon a day. During the fog season at Sutro tower? No. Um, these standard fog collectors, because researchers use them, they're made to standard specifications and standards sizes. The main component on the fog collector is one square meter metal frame. And then that metal frame is wrapped in a specific type of shade cloth. There's two layers of shade cloth that goes to the metal frame that makes up the fog collection panel. Then the fog collection panel was lifted two meters off the ground. It's also anchored in place with Guidewire's.

Speaker 2:          13:41          The shade cloth that we use for the standard fog collectors. A was studied for around 10 years and it was this particular shade cloth with Rochelle. We've and a 35% shade coefficient was determined to be the most optimal material for fog collection to high elevations. Um, and if you look at the shade cloth, a little hard to see right here. But there were shell, we formed the triangle and that facilitates water shedding off the material. And also that triangle pattern is similar to the branch and needle structure on redwood trees. It's very similar. So there's a lot of bio mimicry going on in fog collection. And a big topic of research is a lot of, a lot of researchers and schools are trying to develop materials which are more efficient than the standard fog collection material. And for this project, for this upcoming year, we have several standard fog collectors that we're using and we're also using a larger fog collector with one of these more exotic materials. So it'll be interesting to see what happens.

Speaker 1:          14:48          So we learned a ton from working fog crest quest and Chris and it turns out that fog collection is actually like the perfect bay area solution to our bay area water problem. So we worked with Chris and fog quest to build in strategically placed these fog collectors throughout the bay. Now Chris is monitoring three fog collectors at Sutro tower. This is actually a photo of one of our collectors, so you can see at the base of the tower. Um, and then we have the fog farm that was recently installed at a farm in half Moon Bay. Um, Chris, can you tell us why it fog collectors at Sutro Tower? Make sense?

Speaker 2:          15:21          Sure, um, well to do fog collection successfully, it does require a very specific set of geographic characteristics be met. And one thing that's a little counterintuitive is we're using the advection fog, the ocean fog. But one the main criteria that fog post requires requires is the fog collectors should be placed at around two thirds the height of the fog bank. So in the bay area, that means generally around a thousand feet up. And uh, this is because, because the fog collection is passive, the fog an additional is condensation step is required. And as the fog from the ocean travels up the hill co more condensation occurs and the fog because more water depths. So that's one requirement. Another requirement is a proximity to the ocean. It's generally recommended that the fog collectors should be installed within five miles of the ocean. And another requirement is generally a free path for the fog to go from the ocean to the net. Now these characteristics in the bay area are very difficult to reach because we have a real estate and vegetation that's, that's always occupying space. So it's, it's really a matter of compromises.

Speaker 2:          16:35          Other important factors that we look at when we're seeing if something, if fuck collectible will work is if there's a change in the, in the plant and ecology. If there's really lush green ferns or a lot of moss on a tree during the summertime, it's pretty likely there's going to be fog in that area. Also, you can use just physical examples like if you're driving through an area and you have to try on your windshield wipers, that's an area that is, has a lot of fog. And another, another cue is from nature. We can study the fog drip that comes off the trees and if there's a significant amount of water under a tree, that's a good clue that fog collection will work. And uh, to really, uh, to, to combine all these characteristics. I noticed that it, the one tool the researchers uses Google earth cause it can pull up the elevation, the proximity to the ocean and you can see the obstacles. So that's pretty interesting.

Speaker 1:          17:26          Awesome. So last summer suit, your towers fog collectors were able to collect about 350 gallons during the high fog season. So just a little idea of how much water we can get. So it's now time for a little bit of audience participation. Um, you guys have all got a vial with you. Um, this is a sample of the water collected at Sutro tower over the last couple of days. So I'd like to take this opportunity to taste this fog so we can understand how the flavor of this waters impacts the final flavor profile of the vodka. And we'll taste the vodka in just a moment. Um, so go ahead and get this water a sip. So the water's collected, it's brought to the hangar in tanks. Um, we then carbon filter it, boil it and carbon filtered a second time. Now the filtration steps really important because we are collecting fog and these nice, beautiful nature areas that have things like leaves and dust that might be able to fall into the fog tanks.

Speaker 1:          18:15          So we want to remove any of those particulates. Um, we then boil to ensure the water sanitary and just filter one more time to make sure it's nice and clean. Um, once we've been through these steps, we send the water out to a laboratory for analysis and it turns out that the fog water is actually cleaner. And then the average tap water in the bay area. However, as you guys are tasting it, you'll notice it does have its own character to it. So the thing that I really like about the water is that mineral note that you get there. It reminds me a lot of hiking. I'm really into hiking. And when you're outside on a nice warm day after a damp morning or a rainstorm and you can smell the warm wet stones of like river or something as you're crossing by, that's exactly what the fog water reminds me of.

Speaker 1:          18:54          It also is a slight salty mineral characteristic to it. I don't know if that comes from the ocean. I like to think that it does. Awesome. So we've talked a lot about the water. What are we just dealing to make this vodka? We're using wine. We decided to partner with Bonny doon vineyards cause we decided if we're gonna make this a sustainable vodka, we're going to do this. We want to really do it now. Randall Graham and the Bonny Doon team really inspired me with their wine making techniques. They're huge into sustainable biodynamic farming. And when I'm talking about biodynamic farming, I'm talking about synchronizing the viticultural process with the natural cycles of the plants and of nature so that that's, it's a low impact, natural way to farm things like bringing in symbiotic plants and animals to augment the growing conditions of the grapes instead of using artificial elements, things like fertilizers and pesticides.

Speaker 1:          19:42          So we have these really great sustainable, delicious grapes that are turned into a wine as Randall puts it with minimal human intervention. So we worked with the entire 2012 vintage of Bonnie Dunes, Lyssa garb, long Klein. This is a white wine blend that's made of Piquepoul, Roussanne and Grenache Blanc. We brought all of the wine to the distillery and distilled it up to 190 proof and then used nothing but pure California cop fog water to cut that bod come back down to 80 proof and poof, thug point vodka, this delicious stuff, which you guys all happened to have a taste of. So now the moment you've been waiting for, we've been talking all morning, you're here to taste vodka. Um, so when I'm tasting of vodka, I like to start with nosing it. Okay? It gives, it gives my mind in my palette a preview of what's about to happen.

Speaker 1:          20:30          You guys don't need the swirl. This, I know we're all very used to wine tasting, but there's a lot more alcohol in here. Then there isn't a wine and swirling. It is going to make that volatile alcohol rise up off the surface. When you knows it, you'll get less of the lovely notes and a lot more alcohol. So no swirling, but go ahead and take a nose. Breathe in through your nose and mouth at the same time. That error rates that alcohol sent a little bit so you can start to notice the characteristics coming off of the vodka. Now you can smell that mineral Enos you get from the water, but there's also a little bit of floral characteristic. Also a little bit of sweetness. Next, go ahead and take a small step from your vodka. This is going to prime your palate and cleanse it.

Speaker 1:          21:06          It's awesome. You guys eaten salads back there. Don't want your body, it tastes like salad. So this step we'll go ahead and and cleanse and get you ready and on the next sip and takes slightly larger sip and allow yourself to really experience the texture of the vodka. The nice rounded mouthfeel and all of those flavor notes will start to come out. Floral notes, sweetness, making a vodka from 100% wine was something I was really excited to do. Our straight vodka combines a grain and great profile to make a really interesting complex expression, but so much of that sweetness and that softness comes from the grape. So to have 100% great fod can make spray. Really dare I say robust flavored vodka. I'll right after vodka tasting. A little bit of fun factoids about fog points. So we used a vintage of wine and all the fog water we could collect for six months.

Speaker 1:          21:56          And then doing that we were able to make 2,472 bottles of fog point. So this is a really limited edition vodka. Um, we released it here in California and then a couple select areas throughout the country and the response was awesome. It was really exciting to see spirits nerds and people that are really into the, uh, the distilling industry like it. But to see average people really getting into it, to everyone across the board thought this was a really cool idea and I think it really brought forth the conversation about water conservation and collecting fog. We created bark pro program to different bartenders throughout the country to make fog point Martinis on. We actually just enjoyed one right by the bay bridge over there at epic State Council yesterday. Really delicious way to taste the vodka. And that salted characteristic makes a pair really well with seafood, which is perfect because we have a lot of that here in the bay area. Um, the last fun note is that we donated the profits from fog point sales, uh, back to fog quest and to what other water conservation organizations to push this conversation forward and help facilitate more research into how fog collection could become a viable solution for some of this water crisis that we've been experiencing. And I understand that it really has pushed the conversation forward.

Speaker 2:          23:03          Yes, there's are, because of this project, I've been introduced to numerous groups of researchers and they're interested more in talking with hangar one because there are still supportive of that community. We've also met some businesses that are using fog. Um, I'll talk about them in a bit, but some of the researchers that I've been, we've hang, hang on. One is now been associated with our, uh, out of the U S gs. They at least your toward side. She works in the restaurant regional science center, got a down the street at Menlo Park and which one aspect of her research is to compile satellite data during this over several years during the summertime. And she overlays those satellite images and I was able to get, get an estimate of the approximate fog and low coastal cloud concentrations in an area. This is a real good tool, a good starting point for fog researchers. And this, this map is of the uh, point Ray's area and if you're familiar with kind of the North Bay, you can see that the, that the, the higher the white parts are kind of in the Marin headlands and then upper up by point race. And once again, if we were to cross this map with the other characteristics, especially using Google earth, uh, it becomes, you're able, we're able to pinpoint locations much better.

Speaker 2:          24:23          Other researchers that we've met a include ecologists and Botanists, some this is, some ecologists are studying the fog drip off the trees and they found that it's in some locations, especially on the ridge line above half Moon Bay, that the fog drip off the trees can account for twice as much water as comes during the rainy season. This image here is another is an image from Alicia toward neurosis, a standard fog collectors up in the mid peninsula research area. And what she has there is, like I said, researchers are trying to study different Mesh to see which ones are more effective. And so she has an array up and there's going to be a journal article out shortly, uh, combining this evaluation along with several other evaluations along the coast of California. But what's really fascinating is we met a botanist who was doing research out of Santa Barbara and she focused, she set up some standard fog collectors at a strawberry farm and other biology type equipment.

Speaker 2:          25:25          And she was able to measure how efficiently plants were transporting water and doing photosynthesis. And she was able to prove that after a fog event at these particular strawberry farms, the w the strawberries required less water to thrive. And that's really interesting, especially if you combine that fact with Alicia tour grosses maps where they show that Salinas valley where there's a lot of these farm lettuce and strawberry farms, that's prime fog area. So, um, there's a lot of interesting, uh, studies of fog not really related to collecting, collecting the water, but ecologist or studying and botanists are studying it and also toxicologists are studying it. Um, so now, uh, some of the businesses we've met, uh, with this project include, uh, a guy who sold us who sold hangar one, the first ever fog collector of this style in the United States. Uh, we met Michael Donahue with this company for two h two o and he is a distributor of these German engineered style fog collector, which has been trademarked and branded.

Speaker 2:          26:34          The Cloud Fisher fog collectors, uh, they use, like I say, a more exotic mesh and they're also, they have an aspect of German engineering where there they're more robust than the fog quest fog collectors. But there's also, um, more money involved in this, in the materials. So it's interesting to see the different charities compete for once. One's a highly engineered device and one's more of a minimalist device. Now this, those fog collectors that we saw, um, have been installed successfully and Morocco and in 2018 with the support of a couple of Moroccan charities and the support of a Ger, German government, these, these Claude Fisher style fog collectors are estimated to be the new largest fog collector network. There's supposed to be larger than the one block west has up in Guatemala. So it'll be interesting to see if they can accomplish that by 2018. So through talking with these researchers and these businesses, I really think that fog point has, has established a dialogue and we can, it'll be interesting to see where we go forward from here with water conservation and fog studies and the work on the farms. Yeah. Very cool.

Speaker 1:          27:52          Awesome. So a little bit in closing, um, I hope you guys didn't see that innovation and fresh thinking are at the center of pretty much everything we do at hanger one. So we were so excited to be invited to Google. You know, Google is thought of as a really progressive company that's on the forefront of, of human ingenuity, I would say. And so it's, it's really exciting to be able to come here and talk to you guys about fog point. Um, I hope I've changed your perception of what you're drinking. So next time you're out at happy hour, you can think about how much water is in this vodka and where did it come from. Um, we do welcome your thoughts though. We're always innovating. We're always looking for new ways to make vodka and new things to make vodka from. So please feel free to reach out with to me if you guys have any ideas about any, it's sort of fun projects we could go forth on, any issues we could address in the vodka making worlds. Um, and also lastly like to invite all of you, um, we pass a little car, but please come visit us at the distillery. We're located just up the way at the Alameda Naval Air Station and we'd love to have you so you can see our equipment, learn about our process, tastes, fog point, hangar one, and some of our limited edition Bod Vodkas. So, uh, thank you guys very much. I'd like to open it up for questions if anyone has any questions. Yes, it's a great question.

Speaker 2:          29:02          Well, like I said, the researchers from Stanford or studying or trying to study the characteristics which produce a lot of fog drip. And so there, there, there were at that stage in 2015 I know the research is ongoing now. I'm not sure what you mean by what the impact on the ecosystem is. They won what they're, what the researchers are able to do other than study the fog drip is they're able to do an isotope analysis of the water of the water table from well water and they can identify how much of the water recently came from fog and how much of the water came from rain. And there has been, once again a surprising in some watersheds, especially along the coast are talking about like the crystal springs watershed, uh, just, uh, east of half Moon Bay. That they're, the, I still analysis of that water table shows that the fog has a very significant impact on that watershed.

Speaker 2:          29:58          Yeah. Well, um, that's, that's a good question. The, of course if you were to layer fog nets everywhere, it would probably, it could have an impact, but generally the fog is so spread out and it's, it does encompass such a, such a high and wide area that it would be difficult to, to remove a large amount of water. But an obvious thing to do with the reason I think that the u s gs is involved in mapping this out is they could potentially regulate it and set up the permit system. So people were removing the water in a sustainable manner. Isn't the,

Speaker 1:          30:32          the fog that you get near the bay, wouldn't it have salt in it?

Speaker 2:          30:39          Well, um, certainly there's an impact on the fog from the waves breaking action and that that does introduce different, um, chemicals into the fog. Now as the, as the fog travels up a hill, like I say, far quest recommends, uh, installing the fog nets at a high elevation. Most of your, most of the impurities in the fog dropout. And, uh, in order to provide water to these remote communities, the fog water had to be tested and it's been tested for decades. And it is most generally it meets the criteria set by the UN for clean water, especially compared to a groundwater and some of these more remote areas. But yeah, there, there is a, there is an impact there and it's due mainly to the wave action. That's what, that's the point of exposure. That's where the fog changes characteristics is right when it crosses the beach. So

Speaker 1:          31:39          how much water does a single catcher get an on a good day? Yes.

Speaker 2:          31:44          Yup. Like a Sutro tower I think is a good optimum location in the, in the bay area. And last summer during our heavy fog period, it averaged just over a gallon per day. And that's one squared meter. Usually that's it. Usually they're measured in gallons or liters per day per square meter. So a little over four, four liters per day.

Speaker 1:          32:04          Awesome. We put up a standard fog collection collector at the distillery in Alameda as well. Um, mainly because people want to see them, but also we were kind of interested how much water we would collect. We get about a half a liter a day, maybe a leader on a really good day. So we use it to help water plants, but we're not in the optimal area like Sutro tower. Does it distillery doing even make any, uh, naturally flavored vodkas. Yes. All of our VOD because they're naturally flavored. So any of our flavored vodkas that you will taste are made by mass rating, fruits and botanicals and hundred 90 proof spirit. Um, we then save that infusion and take the fruit out. And if you've ever made infused vodka home, you know that when you take the food out, you have really bluesy fruit left, right? We don't want to let that alcohol go to waste.

Speaker 1:          32:45          So we take the fruit and we put it back into our pot still with a little water and then distill the alcohol out of the fruit. And during that process, whatever oils and compounds that were in our botanicals that the alcohol couldn't pull out the heat from the still breaks down and pulls through and that just lit that distillate and infusion are then used to flavor the final vodka. And so that's why our vodkas tastes so fresh. We work with our farmers at the peak of freshness. They deliver all of the fruit for the year. So for example, when we do Buddha's hands, they're in season, December, January, I'm in Buda hand land during that time and then I don't touch Buddha's hands for the rest of the year. So we do all of our infusions and distillate, it's more seasonally like a winery and then blend and batch them throughout the year so that we do have that fresh flavored vodka.

Speaker 1:          33:26          That's the question. Um, so fog point did sell very quickly. It was so popular. It is sold out almost everywhere. There's a shop located at the distillery that as a few bottles left. And as far as I know, those are the last few. Um, the good news is that with Chris's help and our new fog farm, we're working on another expression of fog point. It will be a little bit different than the current one. We're, we're, we're collecting fog from a different area, so there may be a slightly different flavor profile there and we're exploring what other types of wine we might be able to use as well.

Speaker 3:          33:57          Okay.

Speaker 1:          33:58          Any other questions guys? How much does the standard fog catcher costs? Oh, that's a great question. Oh

Speaker 2:          34:05          yeah. Well, uh, like I said, the materials using the fog quest design, uh, like the one we had, I showed up at Sutro tower, they use an abs post system to hold them up. So it's relatively inexpensive, around $300. Uh, and the academics, you steel posts, they're a little more expensive. Now that's not including any measurement equipment. Usually the accurate boot, the SFC array that I showed that Alicia had up here, it had a tipping bucket, rain gauges on there or they can, they can monitor in real time how much the water's being produced. That adds another three or $400 per unit. So it can get expensive. But the idea is that these can be assembled by people who, who have few resources. So it should be relatively feasible.

Speaker 1:          34:53          As I understand it too, once we've determined the Neri is good for fog collection, it's very easy to put it in an inexpensive fog collector there cause they know they're going to get good thought. Right. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          35:00          That's the really the, the, the first step is to put a smaller one up, test it, verify and then go larger.

Speaker 4:          35:07          So speaking about fog and you know, I guess there's a certain height of the farm, like it won't go past a certain altitude or whatever. Is that, is that taken into consideration when you're making the fog collectors? Like is there an optimal height of the fog collector that you've seen? Like the ones that are produced, um, being that maybe if it's too tall it will evaporate before it gets collected or something like that?

Speaker 2:          35:32          Yeah, well certainly the fog collectors, both the standard fog collectors at larger collection collection nets date, it's important to have them a couple meters off the ground because there's a boundary layer right on the ground and there's a lot of fluid dynamics involved in fog collection and the fluid dynamics, people say that the closer to the ground you get, the more poor the performances. So there's that question and generally the theirs, so they're usually about two meters up off the ground. And this larger system we had it, it went about three meters up after that. And, uh, in order to, like I say, in order to find the optimum elevation, uh, generally you don't try and raise the fog net up to the elevation. You try and get the right height land and then just put it two or three meters up cause it's a lot easier to construct a then trying to raise it really high up. But, um, there are opportunities to install fog collectors like on rooftops, but then those are much higher. But then you have another fluid dynamic problem where the fog hits the building and it kind of shoots over the top. So we're involved with fluid dynamics people to try and create a spoiler or something that will force the fog into the net. But that's, that's a, that's a problem that's going to take several decades probably to solve.

Speaker 5:          36:48          Okay. How is the vodka affected, if at all, by geographically where the fog is collected?

Speaker 1:          36:57          That's a great question. So for the fog point that we tasted today, um, we collected fog from a couple locations including Berkeley, Tilden Park, Sutro tower, and we had a few collectors for a while in the Presidio. Um, because we were so new to collecting fog and because we were collecting such small amounts day by day, uh, we added them all to the same tank. So the flavor profile of the fog is how I know the flavor profile of the fog to be. And I never had the opportunity to taste the fog from different collectors separately until just recently. I'm finding that the water's very similar, but there definitely is a little bit of shift from place to place. I had never thought of, you're talking about fog terroir at this point in my career, but you know what happens? Um, so yes at the, the flavor differences is very minor, I'm finding here in California, but I'd be really interested to see how fog water might taste different and Guatemala or Morocco than what we can get here in northern California.

Speaker 5:          37:48          So I want to just know if there's a way to, um, for you to tell us how long does it usually takes for a new flavor of vodka comes off or in this case when you develop the foc one Bucca how long did this whole planning process happened from beginning to the end?

Speaker 1:          38:05          That's a great question. So, um, when we do a lot of experimentation at the distillery, I often find myself going to the farmer's market and finding some really awesome fruit or botanical we want to play with. Um, so there's, there's always a sort of research, new product development time involved where we really want to dial in the vodka itself and how delicious it is going to be. Um, once we get to that point, there's a lot of other things involved. You know, things like package design, the federal government has to approve our labels, uh, things like that. So it can take quite awhile to get all those things together and to get the bottling materials and, and whatnot. Um, but it does vary from product to product. Uh, some take a lot less time to plan fog point. Unfortunately, it took quite a while because we had the lead time to collect all this water. So it was, it was kind of an ongoing experiment for us and a really exciting day when we had the opportunity to actually say, here's the vodka, here it is. Go out and taste it guys.

Speaker 3:          38:57          Sorry.

Speaker 6:          38:59          Yup. So the question is, what is your advice for someone interested in becoming a master distiller with education avenues? Would you recommend?

Speaker 1:          39:07          That's a really awesome question because I got into distilling a little bit by mistake, if you will. Um, I'm very lucky that I found my passion this way. I have an art degree and uh, it was during a gap in employment that I was looking for something fun to do and stumbled upon a distilling. I was really into craft beer. So it, it drove me there, but I never knew how much I'd love to stealing and how interested in the science of distilling would be. Um, I'm hoping seeing more people out doing things like throwing, distilling winemaking, um, drives people towards stem a little bit more. Cause I think understanding science and engineering is really helpful. Chemistry, especially as a distiller. But there is a lot of art involved. So people from all walks of life are involved in this industry. And there's, there's a lot that folks can contribute from anywhere. So I say if you're interested in distilling or learning to distill on, just to get out there and learn, read as much as you can and, and involve yourself in the industry. Cause you never know when there's going to be a job opportunity and an opportunity to learn.

Speaker 3:          40:06          Okay.

Speaker 6:          40:07          Awesome. Thank you. Thank you guys. A round of applause.
