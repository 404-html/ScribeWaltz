Speaker 2:          01:57          Thank you. Thank you.

Speaker 1:          01:59          Really good. Thank you. Thank you for being here. Um, quick housekeeping. Uh, please silence all devices and we will have some time for Q and a at the end. Uh, since we're recording, it's very important that if you have a question, please ask it at one of the two mikes in the aisles. Okay. So for people in the audience who might not be familiar with Vayner media, um, what would you say is the company's mission and how is that different from other companies in your industry or other country

Speaker 3:          02:27          in general? Yeah, so we're a full VaynerMedia is a full service digital agency. So we're really a creative shop that marries both paid media creative and strategy in the middle. I'm not unlike a lot of other agencies that, that you probably work with for sure. And, uh, Gary would say our mission is to build, uh, the biggest human empire of all kind of all time. Um, I'd like to be a part of that for sure. But I think the, the differentiator for us is that we really do put people at the center that we, because we're an independent, uh, independently owned agency, of course we're, we, we want to make sure that we're paying attention to our top and bottom line and the growth there. But it is really the people that fuel all of that. And I really, I, I personally think that the emphasis that we put on people, the emphasis that we put on culture, the emphasis that we even have a job like mine, which is very different than a chief HR officer, which we'll get to, I'm sure.

Speaker 3:          03:26          Um, that in itself sets us apart. I don't think it makes us better or holier than thou, I think it just makes us very different. And it is something that is hard to Grok sometimes that, yeah. Okay, well are you just like Droga five or are you like anomaly? We're different. We really beat to a different drum. And I think a lot of that is because of who Gary Vaynerchuk is and, and, uh, you know, incredibly fast moving and path that is known for hustle. But quite frankly, he's got a heck of a lot of heart. So, uh, the term honey empire comes up frequently in reference to Vayner. In your role, can you explain what that means? Yeah, I can. There's, there's a lot of different breakdowns, but I've, I've definitely honed my, my, um, my verbatim. I think at this point there's two different ways I look at it.

Speaker 3:          04:13          So p being people first, that's obviously the honey that is taking care of the people. That is making sure that if someone is having a bad day, we're taking care of them. If someone got engaged or married, we're celebrating that. And it is really the idea of creating champions from one another. The collaboration, the um, the emphasis on working together to create the biggest honey empire of all time. The empire of course is the, is as much more of the success. It's much more of the at the client success, the personal success, the uh, the agency shop success. So that is one way to look at it. The other way I like to look at it as something, actually I am going to use this little Easel d mind. Hopefully I'm writing big enough for the, for the camera. But fundamentally, if I think about how I, uh, how I look at, at building strong teams and a and building teams that are sustainable and they last a, I look at starting with the connection again, hopefully that can be re read.

Speaker 3:          05:15          So connection as human beings we are, we are absolutely wired to belong. We are wired to connect with one another, connection plus trust. So once I connect with you and I'm kind of like in it with you, we start to, we start to trust one another. I might let my guard down a little bit more. It might be a little bit easier with you might share something about myself with you plus empathy. So I trust now, but now I'm sharing something. Maybe I'm sharing about, uh, an issue I'm having on another team or maybe I'm sharing something about something, a family, a family issue or celebration or something like that. Connection plus trust plus honey equals accountability, which also is another way to say loyalty. Longevity.

Speaker 3:          06:15          We want our people to be there with us for the long haul. We want Vayner people to be with us forever. Quite frankly. Gary will say that I want you to work with me forever. Accountability, longevity, resilience. Who doesn't need resilience in these times? I mean, things are changing. I'm, I'm, I'm sure you already launched the, you know, three different products while I've been sitting here with you today. And, um, but digital, the world of digital is changing every single second. So you need to be able to roll with those punches. And also, you know, Gary is a disruptor. He's an, he's an entrepreneur. I mean, it is, he could say today, by the time we get back, uh, we're not going to do that. We're going to do this. And we all have to pivot very quickly. So resilience is really important, and our teams and our people, accountability, longevity, resilience, equal speeds.

Speaker 3:          07:00          This is the empire right here. Speed is our number one KPI. People first. Here are the feelings. Here are all the things that I care about all day long. Right? And here's the empire, the fact of how do we get it across the finish line? So I hope that answered the question in a very esoteric way. Yeah, that's great. Um, so you mentioned, I think you probably get this question all the time. How is your role as chief heart officer different from a traditional chief HR officer role? Yeah, I mean, I'm not HR at all. I've, I've, um, I've never been HR. In fact, I, I started in 98, I think before Google, before Facebook as a project manager in, in San Francisco, and then morphed my way into the agency side on the client, client facing side. And, um, and then found my home in strategy and a way, way, way back when I was training to be a psychotherapist.

Speaker 3:          07:55          So human development, human behavior is always something that's really, really fascinated me and still does to this day. Uh, that's kind of like everything for me, how we work, why we work, how we can work better. And, uh, so I've, I've been a strategist for a very long time, almost 20 years, and I am not HR, not a, I'm not, I'm, I'm certainly now HR and I'm more equipped and more educated in the science of HR and the benefits and, and, uh, international visas and laws and whatnot. But, um, that's not my job. We have some incredible HR people in the, in, in, uh, the crowd right now that are on my team, which is amazing. And they really take care of, um, the, the HR factor, the, the science of it, the benefits, payroll, 401k's and, and really, really the reviews, the review cycle, all of those things as well.

Speaker 3:          08:49          So my job isn't, I mean, you, you would say that, send that to Claude because she's a head of HR, but, but I'm not, I get to oversee that, which is, and I get to cocreate with people that know more than I know in terms of HR and he'll, Gary really sees himself as HR because he's a people first person. And so the synergy that he and I have in terms of how we feel about people, our belief in people, um, our gut about people is really what created this role and why we call it heart. Because we actually think of HR, which I have no idea what that really means as hard. In fact, we changed the name of the department when I, when I started to people and experience, because after all, that's what we're doing here. You have a, um, a department of, you know, people ops. It's very similar, similar, but the idea of human resources to me is very foreign. I, I really, I don't, um, I don't get it, but, um, but if anyone wants to explain those two terms to me, I'm open so people can experience and, um, and really I'm not, I'm not chief of HR, but, uh, but again, we've got a great team that, that takes care of that.

Speaker 1:          10:01          Excellent. So, uh, one of the things you've called yourself as an emphatic truth teller, uh, when you were describing what it was that Gary needed to sort of scale what he did for the organization as the organization expanded, um, what's the hardest truth you've had to tell or, or at least the hardest one you can share?

Speaker 3:          10:23          Sure. It's, uh, it's empathic. Empathic, I think someone wants to call me an empathic truth. Okay. Maybe I didn't tell her his heard that. Maybe it's an emphatic, I don't know. I'm sure I, hopefully it's enthusiastic, but, um, you know, it's, it's hard. It is a challenge. I think sometimes to confront someone with something they might may not see about themselves. Um, it's hard as another human being to take that step, that bold step forward as a just another learner in the world. And to think that I see something that they don't see. I'm by no means am I, you know, I'm not a psychotherapist. I'm, I'm not a physician. So it's really difficult to get up the gumption and want to shine a mirror in front of someone. And I think that is, that's a difficult thing that we all have. However, when we give feedback and when we share something with another person, it's really an active caring.

Speaker 3:          11:24          So when I don't do that, I'm really withholding, quite frankly. I'm, I'm manipulating someone's growth and development and, um, the way I go about it is as, as hopefully with as much grace tack and, um, and you can generosity of spirit as I possibly can. But that is something that I think is, is, um, is I, you just have to step wisely into that, into those shoes. I'm cautiously of course, because you never know how someone's going to react. But if you, um, if you go into that truth again with empathy, um, and with humility, my God, then I think the door can open to so much possibility and that's what it's all about. Possibilities there an example that you can think of where, yeah, telling that truth. There's an example. I mean, when did I get here? So I think an hour ago I was in a room with a very senior, um, senior account holder count and our client service person, and this, uh, this person was telling me that he has been exploring his team for the last three months and these are the three buckets that he thinks are, uh, wrong with his team.

Speaker 3:          12:36          So it's probably my age. He's in his forties and um, and he, maybe he knows more about life than I do. I have no idea. But he and I have had many conversations over the past, I would say eight or nine months about these, these, uh, issues in his team and only today he's bringing them to me. So what I did say to him is, you know, with all due respect, I really believe that you've been protecting your team this entire time. There's no need to protect your team and these three buckets that you just shared with us, it should have been shared with me nine months ago because we could have fixed it. We didn't need to go through all the rigmarole and all the people issues and all the, the hardship and all the missed deadlines and all of those things if we, if we just could get truth.

Speaker 3:          13:21          So that's probably the most recent conversation. And, and he took it as well as can be. I'll, we'll see what happens when I get back to work. But again, you go into it with, with as much grace and, um, and just generosity, you know, I want to help him. So your role was created to help preserve [inaudible] culture while it grows rapidly. We know a little bit about that here at Google. What are, um, what are the elements of, is culture that you most fear losing as you continue to expand and scale? Yeah. So yeah, the role was this role was created to scale Gary and he says to scale the unscalable, which I think is a phenomenal way to say it. I mean, how do we scale culture? That's the big question. It's a question I get all the time in a question. I'm sure you guys get it.

Speaker 3:          14:13          Almost 80,000 people and, and wanting to maintain Google across the world. So our culture is really built on a few different values that I can say over the last eight and a half years are pretty tried and true empathy, which I will call heart speed, which I would call hustle, hustle and heart possibility. We work for an entrepreneur and everything really is possible. There is a yes all the time until there isn't, but it takes a very long time to get to the know if, if ever, um, positivity. I mean, Gary overindexes as an optimist, I'm probably very close behind him. And, um, and winning competitiveness. And those are things I believe are still in our DNA absolutely over eight and a half years. But those are things that we need to continue to stoke the fire on. So for example, let's take the conversation that I just had.

Speaker 3:          15:13          That conversation was out of line and out of touch with our culture because the, the, the winning was misguided. The wanting to win was miss w the wanting to win was, was Cayston fear. That's not one of our values. It's not how we, how we use and foster our culture. And so, you know, and that's just talking to one individual. Where is that? Is that spread anywhere? I mean, so, um, the most important thing that I'm doing every single day is I'm talking to a lot of people. Quite frankly, I'm listening to a lot of people and I'm just collecting data, collecting information. I'm holding space to see what happens, to see what comes out. And as I'm speaking to people and collecting data, I'm looking for patterns and I'm looking to hear if I hear a similarity on one certain team or if I hear a similarity on a department, even though the department might be in a different country, it might have legs in a different culture, a different company start different country.

Speaker 3:          16:11          Um, and so as I hear these patterns, that's where we start to deploy more people that are what I like to call culture carriers. By no means as the title culture carrier, although they should put it in their signature, right? These are people that really get, uh, but get a sense of the water that we're drinking every single day. It's not Koolaid, it's water, it's pure, it's real, you know. Um, and so in every office and certainly in our offices here in New York, which we have to, um, I've, I can depend on and rely on using and, and asking that person or that person or that person to go take that person for a walk or for a cup of coffee or go have a little mini town hall with those eight people who are just kind of crusty. Um, so that is something that is it tea?

Speaker 3:          16:59          It's like 24, seven job. It's an absolute 24, seven job, which, um, you know, meeting with people one on one, having hangouts with people going, you know, I'll start a big round of office visits next week in different countries and different cities. And so making sure that we have that high touch at every single moment. Obviously Gary is doing the same exact thing. He might be doing five minute meetings, he might be doing a lot of texting, but we try to cover and h and cover as much ground as we possibly can. And, uh, ensuring that the culture is still being fed and fed and watered and so that we can, we can have like new sprouts every single day. I talk in metaphors a lot, but that's what it looks like to me. Quite frankly. It's 800 people now I think 805 people I think. And it's a lot. It's just a lot of heartbeats. It's a lot of mouths to feed and certainly don't need to explain that to, to Google. But um, so we've got, we've got a lot of learning to do, but I do think that we've implemented some, um, some really good a tried and tested um, abilities now.

Speaker 1:          18:06          Yup. Are there, in the run up to 800, are there things that you feel like you've sort of lost irretrievably? Um, or, or things that just couldn't, couldn't survive from the smaller scale to the larger scale?

Speaker 3:          18:20          I don't think we lost them. I think we lost sight of them and then got them back. That's what I think. So in terms of growing, growing, growing, and that's just for example, like the, the talent team that's here. I mean they, they, there was a period of time and there's only about five of them in all different countries and New York, we've got three, uh, three or four. Um, but there was a time that they were hiring hand over fist. I mean, we couldn't bring enough bodies into the offices and into our world. And what we lost sight of was training in what we lost sight of was the orientation. And what we ended up doing is throwing them into a fire without giving them a sense of what's in our DNA, what's in our, what's in our, our bloodstream and our water. And, um, there were moments, I would say in the last 18 months, two years, that you could feel the ground start to not tremble, but just start to shake a little bit.

Speaker 3:          19:18          Or the wheels on the bus just start to rattle a little bit, a little harder than I like. I like a lot of speed, but it was a little much. Um, and in those moments it's, you know, that's something that I talked to Gary about and we talked to my team about and we have to kind of do a full court press in that moment. There's some things that we're not going to be able to retrofit and change. But going forward, we know how important it is to Orient, you know, we have a week long orientation and how important it is for that employee to really, really connect, get a sense of belonging, tried and true. We want them here. You know, we've gone through three rounds of interviewing, maybe four. And so when they come in, we already have this incredible sense of belief in them and it takes an employee obviously a longer time to believe in the org. But in those cases where we were, we got lost a little bit. And so, um, anyway, we've retrofitted.

Speaker 1:          20:10          And are there things that you find that you can do at scale that you couldn't do, uh, when you were smaller?

Speaker 3:          20:17          That I actually believe in terms of going back in time a little bit back in time. It's not the right way to say it because we can't go back in time, but we can certainly go back and have that conversation with that swath of people that we may have missed. Um, we moved to a, we opened up our first international office about 15 months ago in London. And in doing so, we sent out x paths to open up the office. Uh, one of the things we learned very quickly is an, and I worked in London for for a significant amount of time, so it's something I knew, but as an ex pat, it's different with different glasses on. Um, it's so important to get locals in your office and get locals in your office fast. Otherwise it really is like the American invasion in many ways. And that's not gonna work. That's not going to work in another country, but it's certainly not going to work when you, when you are a local and you walk in and there's eight x paths and they're telling you what to do. So those are things that we've had to look at and, and reverse engineer as we go forward.

Speaker 1:          21:23          So, uh, we're just finishing up our performance management and compensation cycle. Uh, African every company has them in some form or another. Um, but those processes, performance management, compensation planning, um, they're often seen as sort of being directly at odds with uh, the effort to create psychological safety, a culture of trust. How do you handle performance evaluation and rewards without undermining the, the honey empire? It's so tough. I mean this crew right in

Speaker 3:          21:53          front of me that, that uh, that's on my team is and they're the ones that take a little bit of the bruising. Um, because there is such a juxtaposition between we love you, we believe in you. We want you, you have a home, we want you here forever. Here's 6% or you just got all fives on a review, on a review form. Cause we just got out of our cycle as well. And uh, but you're not getting, you're not getting promoted, but here's 10%. These are really hard conversations. I don't have the answer other than so much high touch and that means you know, spending time with that employee, going back to that employee, letting them know we work for them, working with their manager, seeing how we can, you know, if, if, if we're not able to give them the um, the salary increase that they were so hoping for and it is 6% or it is 8% making sure that what's in their review in terms of their training and development or their growth plans, we are hitting immediately or as soon as we possibly can.

Speaker 3:          22:53          That's, that's one way I think that we can surround that person or that cohort with as much heart, as much honey as we possibly can. Spending time with Gary is always going to be a benefit and it's weird to kind of dangle that in front sometimes, but it is so incredibly helpful when you get that time with Gary and he's able to, in his own words, really, really hone you into the vision because the vision is, the vision is amazing. Like the, the vision of what we're doing. We're building an agency so that at some point in time we can buy brands and, and own them and create the marketing and awareness for them. Like that's awesome that there's not a lot of agencies that are doing that. Um, but it is, um, it's something we need to spend a lot of time, a lot of time with and a lot of, um, not coddling and not pampering, but just again, high touch. I say that I say that phrase a lot, but it is really what we do, um, from a resident on up to an SVP. Hmm.

Speaker 1:          23:57          And in line with fat as, as chief heart officer, how do you, how do you go about helping someone when they're not succeeding in their role?

Speaker 3:          24:07          So when they're not succeeding in their role, we do as much of a three 60 as we can first and foremost to find out is that really true or is that just that one person or that one manager from the top down? That's like rabbi, Rabbi back because that's not fair. Right? So we really try to look at it in a, in a holistic manner and get as much three 60 as we possibly can. We put people on performance plans 30 day, 60 days, sometimes 90 day, um, in, in London. We will extend that notice. We will extend that a 90 day trial period if we need to for another three months. We want people to be successful again. We've invested so much time as you do too in recruiting, finding that right talent, bringing them in orientation. I mean it costs a lot of money.

Speaker 3:          24:51          Also talk about the empire, you know, it's when, so when you lose an employee, it customers doubled, tripled to get that next employee in. So making sure that we're giving them very specific, clear ways in which to improve is that's our job. Actionable, measurable, ways to improve. Otherwise, like that's not fair, you know? So we spend a lot of time doing that. We don't have a lot of people on performance plans. I don't know if that's a good or a bad thing. Maybe we're not looking at, uh, looking deep enough. But for the most part, I think coming out of this review cycle right now, I can say that it's a very low percentage and we're doing our best to, to get people to get the seize up to a B and to get the bees up to an a. One of the things that we do have that I'm super proud of is we have this alumni program.

Speaker 3:          25:43          So if someone, if we have a c that we know will be in a somewhere else, or if we have some of those just not working out, we're just not the right culture for example. Or we just moved too fast, we will do our very best as we let them go to find their next interview to find their next role. And so we can do that based on Gary's network of course, and getting and based on the enormous amount of, um, job requests he's getting in every single day. Like, Hey, do you have a, Hey, do you have a, and so we'll do our best to do the networking and then set them, set them up with that first interview.

Speaker 1:          26:20          So, um, one of the things that I think we're, um, we, we've noted in our culture and that and that we're struggling with is how do you, how do you make a manager, right? How do you take somebody who's a tremendous performer as an individual contributor, um, and either determined that they should or shouldn't be a manager and then make sure they have the manager skill sets, which are actually generally very different from the skill sets that made them successful as an individual contributor. Um, what, what's your approach to, to making managers? So

Speaker 3:          27:01          we are in the process of figuring out that training. I'll tell you, unlike, uh, I should say not, not unsimilar to many agencies, you get promoted, you just rise through a ladder and you just get maybe like a higher salary and more responsibility. But there isn't a lot of manager training and agencies probably due to the nature of our work now it's incredibly fast where the service of clients, we have an output. Thank you very much. So forth and so on. And You keep on going on and on and on. Management management training is something we kicked off in January in difference in different forms. And that, that, uh, that included our presentation training that included a radical candor feedback training that is now including, um, a facilitation training. But we are still figuring out what is the right, what, what does a Vayner media manager recognizing that we want everyone to have uniqueness and how do we go about having that training?

Speaker 3:          28:02          How do we go about, is it one on one? I mean, obviously experiential is the way to do for, for, for I believe that we learn faster when we experience it. We either teach it or we experienced it. So we're developing those things right now. And, um, I absolutely wish I had a magic wand and we could make that happen faster. But, um, but spending time with people and really figuring out what makes them beat, what makes them tick, kind of figure it, helping them figure out kind of their own human behavior so that they can be that much more tuned into others, I think is the key there.

Speaker 1:          28:39          All right. Um, I have a couple more questions, but I want to take a minute and just see if there are questions in the audience that, yeah.

Speaker 4:          28:54          Hi. Hi. Um, something that is so important. Yeah. I think hard to manage for a lot of people that I know that you've done having worked with you before really well is one, found your passion and then secondly, you found a way to get there. Um, I would just love, and I know you mentor a lot of people in that way too. I'd love to hear your perspective on that. Tips and tricks of how you kind of found value in this and navigated your way. Thanks, Carrie. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          29:32          and I've worked, worked with each other about 13 or 15 years ago, so thanks for being the first question. Yeah. Um, so I love doing coaching and I love mentoring and, um, and throughout my years, whether or not I was at this company or that agency or running my own surfing company, um, I've picked up a lot of positive psychology, uh, tips and tricks along the way and, and Life Coaching and executive coaching tools. And I, I, I do a lot of coaching. I called them white sessions. Some people might call them northstar sessions, but, um, what I find is most important with, with all people and all human beings, is making sure that at some point in our existence, we were able to define and touch our purpose, our passion and our purpose could be very different. My one of my passions is snowboarding, but my purpose has nothing to do with snowboarding.

Speaker 3:          30:26          Um, so there's a difference there. But, um, so I take people through value, values, exercises. Uh, I really like people to be big in the room. That's something I say a lot. So when they're with me and they're in one of these 45 minute, hour long sessions, what I say to them, it's like, it's just us in the room. So it'd be big. Like, tell me really, what is the value you bring to teams? Like no one's listening, just you and me. Uh, then I'll look at their values. Sometimes I even asked them what they wanted to be when they, when they were kids, what do they want to be when they grew up? Because I think when we go back to the origin of time, when we were just innocent and we wanted it to be an astronaut or a film director or whatnot, there's a lot of truth in that.

Speaker 3:          31:05          Um, and sometimes there's still threads. There's still like a red thread that runs through from when you were a kid to when you're an adult. Um, I really ask people to, it's a funny little corny question, but to think about in their most innocent of times, brushing their teeth in the morning, just who are they? Like, what is, what is, what are they, where's the resonance? What, you know, are they, are they mad? Are they like, when you wake up in the morning, who are you, what, what type of person are you? And then I, so all of that together and we hopefully we land on a guiding principle or a mission statement, something that they are really proud of and they can own. And they put, I say, you know, put that in your wallet or, you know, put that on your laptop. Um, because it's, it's unique to each and every individual.

Speaker 3:          31:50          And I really think that once, you know, if I, if we're successful in this, might take three sessions with them. Um, they go back to their desk and they can use some of that with other people. I mean, that's how I see it. That's how I'm scaling myself, quite frankly, aside from the team, if I'm having this incredible interaction with another human being, that they're going back to their desk, their team, their cohort, and they're able to, you know, sprinkle their own magic dust, you know, and that way that we just, the, I mean, the good vibes just keep, keep, keep on going. But, um, that's what I do. I just spend a lot of time doing a lot of coaching and, um, and just like creating space for people to just be whomever they want. You know, at Vaynermedia, and I wouldn't doubt at Google as well.

Speaker 3:          32:36          We're teaching a lot more than just fundamental skills of how to use ad manager or how did you know how to be an incredible client service person. I mean it's life skills. So now, yes, you can teach empathy, someone has to be interested and open to learning. You can teach self awareness and those types of things. So I think that's what juices me every single day that I don't have to just, I'm not just talking about, um, how to get this bottle into more hands, you know, talking about why, why would you even be interested in getting this bottle into more hands? Hmm.

Speaker 4:          33:11          I've another question. Yeah. Hi. Thanks for being here. Um, I had an opportunity to see Arie speak for the first time like two weeks ago at a conference. Um, and as you all know who probably worked for him, he has the, uh, energy and ability to kind of, might drop on the whole room and make people like kind of silence after I want to be a part of what he's doing or like it's so, um, just engaging. So my question is kind of on the recruiting process. Do you guys find that a lot of your applicants come from like Gary v lovers who just are a huge fan of him and want to work for him? Or like maybe even some of the recruiters in the room who work at Vayner? Like what is your guys's process? Do you reach out? Do you have a bunch of people like that who apply? I can only imagine after hearing him speak. So just wanted to know kind of what the recruiting process looks like for you guys. Cool.

Speaker 3:          34:07          Keep me, keep me honest team. But um, he's, he's absolutely, in fact he's contagious. I mean that energy and the mic drop and the, and the realism of him is like something you just want to be around. Cause there's not many people out there like him, uh, at least that are um, that you see their content every single day in every single way. So we, I would say it's, it's split. We obviously, you know, we hire for skill set fit and a culture edition. If you wanted to Gary's inbox right now, you would see, I'm sure probably 300 people that are like, I will work for you for free. And that might have just happened in the last eight hours. By the time we get to eight o'clock tonight, there might be another hundred and 50 that just want to work for us for free, which is, that is amazing.

Speaker 3:          34:52          I just like incredible and an honor. Are those people the right skillset? I Dunno. You know, and that's where we have to start calling through some of those cvs if we get, now we have specific recruiters that are looking at just media, video production account, project management and whatnot. Every now and then we'll get sent one of these people to have these people. Or Hey, you know, the owner of the new, uh, the New York jets has a son. Here you go. Um, we have, uh, so we, we have to look through those incredibly carefully. Of course we'll give someone not an at bat or at an interview, that's for sure. If they are a student will help, hopefully get them into our internship program, which is in the summer. If are just coming out of university, maybe we can get them in as a resident. Again, the skills are super, super important because we move so fast.

Speaker 3:          35:44          It's, it's not charity, as Gary would say. He says a lot. It's just like, I mean, what are we doing here? Like we're working, we're here to work. We're here to, we are here to hustle and to be the, you know, the biggest human, uh, human agency in the face of the earth. But, um, we really need to take our time and go through those cvs and that's, that takes a lot of time. And then we have to make sure that we're interviewing really, really carefully. Otherwise we could just get a, you know, a lot of Gary fanatics and, and maybe not a lot of the specific work that we need to get done, but it's always fun to see those emails come in. A lot of fun.

Speaker 4:          36:21          Chairman. Hi Erin. Hi. Question for you. Um, as Vayner media focuses on building a honey empire or it more of the work environment that has more heart involved in getting more comfortable and connected with your employees to make them more productive. And as you know, Google completely sense itself in that way as well. And where we're culture is huge. Diversity is very important for us, um, for the benefit of our team and employees. Um, can you talk about a time where you using your approach towards, um, connecting with your employees that have, that have made them more productive and so you can say, yes, this is something more scalable. And, and do you implore other companies or other agencies for that matter, um, to kind of employ employed that approach as well?

Speaker 3:          37:08          Yeah. So let's see if I'm, if I'm tracking correctly, what I, what I, what I think you're asking is

Speaker 3:          37:16          a little bit of the training that we do with our employees that are, is basically kind of geared a little bit towards the performance and their success. So you know, the honey and the empire portion, maybe like looking at this or looking at what I was talking about in the beginning, which was putting people first and if you really, really hone in and deploy as much empathy and care and Tlc and generosity and giving to employees that the output is, I mean you, you just get 10 fold more of the output. Um, so we do a lot of, we, we, we spend time doing a lot of small town halls, size of this room, uh, town halls where I will be, I will just take, I will field questions that come at me about our culture, about changes or more transparency. I'll do that because I fundamentally believe we need more communication throughout the agency.

Speaker 3:          38:07          And I should say I started at the agency as the SVP on the client side. And so I can fully remember for those 18 months I was there. I was, I was thinking, Gosh, we need more communication from leadership. We need more communication from leadership. And now that I'm in leadership, it's something that I think about all the time. How can we increase our transparency? How can we make sure that we're delivering on the promise of the honey empire? How can we, how can we make sure that we're delivering that and development that, um, that we, that we also promised? So spending time with people is super, super important. I've already said that, but, um, making sure that I'm coming in, you know, it's, it's funny, so much of what I do, it comes so naturally to me. And that's the great thing because I'm, I'm living my purpose to caries to Carrie's question.

Speaker 3:          38:57          I'm able to, my purpose is to fill this, facilitate growth and change and, and people and companies and teams and be a team builder and be of service. And I'm able to do that every single day. But I realized not everyone is able to do that. So, um, me showing that I think it's really important that, that everyone knows that I work for them. No one, there's absolutely no one that works for me. Um, and I will give whatever I possibly can to help someone over that finish line or help someone from the 10 yard line to the 30 yard line, yard line. Um, and that takes a lot of time and energy and effort. But I think that's the wonderful thing about being in a company, especially run by Gary where, you know, he wants to buy the New York jets. And so we function as a team in many, many ways and making sure that we're deploying to your point, deploying as much of that honey and the empire, uh, internally and, and hopefully there's a trickle on effect in other companies.

Speaker 3:          39:53          Yeah. Yeah. Um, how do you scale that you go back afterwards and are you able to scale that dynamic to say this actually works and it's actually making our employees more productive? How do you scale that? Yeah, the scaling question is such a great question for us. I think at this size, at the 800 mark, um, because as I look out on the, on the landscape, it's not any, it's not anything I'm going to be able to do alone. And it's, and it's something that my team can certainly do, but they're going to need extra reinforcements very, very soon because we can't be in every place at every single time. And, uh, in order to track back and see how that employee or that cohort of people as a, you know, if there are, um, move, if, if they're, if they're needle has moved since we last trained with them or we lost spent time with them, it takes a lot of time and energy and it takes away from something else that we're doing that might be extremely pressing.

Speaker 3:          40:53          Um, so it's, it's really, I, you know, leaning on the culture carriers that we've built right now to kind of be the finger on the pulse for me when I can't be there or for Gary. Um, and making sure that we can track back and there is something to measure. But growth is something that we can, we can feel, I mean, you can see it in the, you can see it in the water, you can feel it, you can certainly feel it when you're with someone. And especially because we have people that stay with us, the longevity for a long time. So you can see how they've EBD and flown throughout their, their tenure ship at Vayner media. And we really use them quite frankly, to help other people grow and to make sure that we are, um, going back and, and, and I'm tying up any loose ends that we may have missed. So it's really, it's really a human, it's really human effort. I mean, thank God for Google and Google docs and Google forms because that's what we run on running. Um, it's, it's, it's human effort. And, uh, at some point, you know, we're starting to assist, systematize much more now that we're a, we passed the 700 people. Mark, thanks for the question. Okay.

Speaker 5:          42:09          Zoom out a little bit of the previous question asked around diversity and inclusion in two dimensions. So one is, especially in the creative side of the agency, business diversity has been a massive problem in this part of the industry within LGBT people of color are dramatically underrepresented, underrepresented in every creative agency, every creative department inside companies. I'm wondering if you could talk about your, your point of view on sort of like how you acquire that talent to you sort of have a specific lens for that or not. Um, and then something that I think it's very personal to a lot of Googlers is also how once those people come in, um, they do feel that sense of connection, trust and empathy so that think she'd feel included and want to build that sense of loyalty.

Speaker 3:          43:05          Yeah. Thank you for the question. It's actually one that I love digging into because as you said, we're all trying to figure it out. Um, mapping the macro to the micro Mapi a macrocosm to the microcosm is much more difficult than I would've ever known. Um, as I'm now looking at it from the top down and also just like being on the floor a diversity and inclusivity is, and they are different things of course. Um, it's one thing to have I diverse employee, uh, nasty if you will, but then to deploy inclusivity and the belonging is, I think that's almost more challenging. So one of the things that is extremely important to us is creating a safe space where people feel that they can bring their whole self stork and that means physical safety and psychological safety. Absolutely. Bar none. We were talking about this earlier, it's like literally on my head every single day when people were new, when can't, let's start with the candidate experience.

Speaker 3:          44:06          When you are a candidate and you walk in and if you are a person of color and you aren't seeing any other people of color, that is, that cannot feel good. But there's just no way. If you are a female and you are being interviewed by males, there's no way that feels good either. So I mean that's, that's just even talking about like a white female of privilege, you know. So making sure that we have as much diversity out of in our office is in our offices is really, really fundamentally the most important thing that we can do every single day. And that means hiring, like hiring the best person. Of course we're going to hire the best person that comes our way. Skillset, culture edition. I like this idea of making sure or trying to make sure that our values with that candidate and that candidate or in the same zip code.

Speaker 3:          44:57          It's something I was just sharing with the team the other day. I don't expect your value in my value to be completely apples to apples, but I would like them to be similar that I think the value piece of it I think does open up the, um, uh, is a, gives us a little bit more of an ability to widen our net or cast a wider net when we are looking for those candidates. Um, back to creating a safe space where people feel like they can bring their whole selves to work. If you are a person of color, you want to see more people of color. If you are Lgbtq, you want to know that we have a private group. If you have a learning disability, are you dyslexic? Like myself? You want to know that we have tools that you can use. Um, all, you know, if you have a physical handicap, like you want to be recognized for that not as an other and an outlier, but that we can embrace you and, and take care of that.

Speaker 3:          45:47          So, um, you know, the 3% conferences going on right now up the street. And one of the things I love about what they've done there is they've called attention to the fact that diversity is so few and far between and creative agencies. Um, the idea of finding that other, especially on senior level creative positions is really challenging. It's really challenging for us. I'm happy to say I don't have the, we don't, we actually don't have stats on multicultural diversity because people can opt out of that question. So what makes me happy is when I walk around, when I walk across the floor and I can see just difference. And I don't mean difference, but the Max, I mean difference with a Capital d because that's, this room is different. Um, it's something that is just so incredibly important. I, I can't even stress that enough.

Speaker 3:          46:39          It is, I don't want to even say it's my favorite question to answer because I don't have the answer, but is my favorite thing to kind of chew on all together? Um, and you know, does that mean where we need to learn lean in on the four d is more, do you mean there's, there's, there's pockets in the city and pockets and Chattanooga and pockets in schools that we can lean on to get different talent. Um, it's something we certainly do with our residents and our internship to really like make sure we're casting that wide net and able to mirror the macrocosm of this, you know, this world. Um, and it's something we haven't, we haven't solved for yet. It is a work in progress and uh, but something that is so near and dear to like what I'm doing back to Gary, like what are we doing here?

Speaker 3:          47:23          Like we have to make sure that we are finding talent that represents this world. You know, and one of the things I'm proud of that, uh, back at work is that we have squads, we used to call them tribes in fact, and we took away that word tribes because of the cultural sensitivity. But we have squads and I like to use the word cohorts quite a bit. Um, and there was a squad that is called the Amigos squad and they found it each other. They found each other. They founded this group first and foremost, to be able to market to a Latinas and Latinos and the Hispanic culture. And now they've really a, there, it's an inclusive, it's an open door group and it's an inclusive group. But it's one that keeps me very, very honest about what we're doing, about, uh, diversity and inclusivity. And, um, so I'm happy. I'm happy. We have that and a, and a and still a startup quite frankly. So thank you for the question. And I'm open to any ideas, uh, to chomp on for, you know, how we solve this. Yeah. Thank you Tom. Passionate about that. Yeah, come on.

Speaker 1:          48:34          So, um, if you're successful in making your workplace a place where people feel included, feel at home, um, what's your approach to work life balance? How do you make sure that, uh, you know, is there a danger of tipping that too far where some people might fail to a build or maintain their life outside of work?

Speaker 3:          48:55          So the sarcastic me says to you, is there such a thing as work life balance? I mean sarcastic and slightly true. Um, what, what I do is, is by no means is it 24, seven, but I'm, I'm working quite a bit. Um, and I'm okay with that because I've chosen this job, what I, I've actually turned over this idea of work life balance for the moment. And I look at energy management and that's kind of the term that I look at and I try to share a lot more of with um, with our employees. We have 80% millennials. So that right there, and it's is an, we're an agency so that is as cut throat as it gets. I mean, you are like, you are beholden to a client. Uh, and that means you got to get that out when you said you were going to get that out, you know, unless you're going to answer the phone tomorrow with like, you know, client breathing down your neck.

Speaker 3:          49:48          Yep. Which happens also. But this idea of energy management is something that makes more sense to me today rather than a work life balance. Unfortunately, or fortunately, energy management is really being, uh, aware of how you're feeling, where your anxiety level is, where you're at, where your anxiety level is. Are you at Code Red? Because if you're a code red, we need to like figure out how to get to pink or how to get to it like an an orange. Um, setting up little milestones across your day to then celebrate. Take a break. So you're going to work for 10 minutes. I'm sorry. You're going to work for two hours on this one project that you're working on, this one spreadsheet or this one deliverable. You're going to, you, you're going to get to a stopping point where you know, you can get up, take a breath and you can go check Instagram for 10 minutes.

Speaker 3:          50:36          You can go out, walk the high line, you can go for a cup of coffee, you can go out to lunch. Those are things I think going back to my project management roots, I think they're really, really important. I think of, you know, if I'm looking at a Gantt chart of my day and where my energy tips and falls and after lunch and whatnot, just being super, super aware of, um, how, how I'm feeling inside and how an employee employees feeling inside and how that's manifesting, whether or not that's manifesting physically and I'm, you know, maybe someone's grinding their teeth are getting really upset or uh, or how that's just manifesting inside with, you know, not feeling good enough about yourself and feeling a extremely competitive with that other person or Gus, you heard that person's getting 10 k more and you do the same job like, so managing, managing one's energy is super important right now.

Speaker 3:          51:26          Yes, having work life balance is like a dream. I think that if any of us can go back in time and clock in and clock out as some of our parents did or work that eight hour day with a half an hour lunch break as some people do in Europe, quite frankly. Um, that is kind of utopic and there are places to do that. Um, I can't tell you that agency life is that place right now. And maybe it maybe, maybe as we see more a remote working, you do that really well. I mean, does that extremely well. Um, but agencies are funny because for the most part, you're in roles that you need to be, you need to be present on a floor for, you need to be able to look across that desk and say, Hey, will you look at my deck for a second? There is such a collaborative, um, Yin and Yang there. So energy man. Uh, so work life balance is, um, is something that I'm aware of. Wish I had that answer too. Uh, but time management is where I'm really trying to get more people to focus on and be aware of just how they're feeling in any given moment and when they can just take a timeout, timeouts really, really, really help. And we all, I mean, we all deserve timeouts. Like, what are we doing here? Yep. Great. Well, thank you so much for your time. Thanks.
