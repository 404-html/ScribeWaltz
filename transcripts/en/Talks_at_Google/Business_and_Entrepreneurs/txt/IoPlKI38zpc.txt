Speaker 1:          03:28          We've stopped the introduction, the Google Vr with a fun fact. So we usually do this in Google. So we'd like to hear one less known or a fun fact from each, a few Lakshmi.

Speaker 4:          03:40          Um, God, everything about me, I lay my life on my sleeves. I don't know what about me. Um, I used to act in theater. I did my MBA with a minor in theater and I taught that that would work it in 10 for two years, save enough money and moved to La and become an actress. But I fell in love with technology and kept thinking, okay, next year, next year, next year, and then realized at 28 that I'm too old. So that's good.

Speaker 1:          04:12          Um, so I think that was one. So, Oh God, by the police. I feel wondering why we were in graduate school. Love it. The uh, organizing fully and we messed up a brand new dance load, so I won't, I'll tell the whole story at some other point. One for someone who runs a weight loss coaching startup you and hopefully it doesn't show, when you look at me, I can out eat anyone in this room. So when I got the mattered and we went on our honeymoon, my husband who had not seen my true colors chill, you belonged to want to botch up. And Carola and my dad had organized my favorite dinner for me, which was like this huge heaping mound of Kettler. Horizon three big different abuzz of various fish. Corinne's and my husband watched

Speaker 3:          05:02          quantified fascination. I proceeded to eat something that is like not good. Don't do you want to approach it?

Speaker 4:          05:15          I do too.

Speaker 5:          05:17          Anything is left off my [inaudible] sorry. You think I have um, uh, given a doll. So maybe one continuing on the universities for this, I was detained for a few hours in a police station and it was not as trivial as messing up with a dance floor. It does a little more serious than that, but I didn't live it. I bet.

Speaker 3:          05:45          So. Okay. So moving on door, Boston running on one started,

Speaker 1:          05:51          I know you started in a regular it and then went to do a data analyst job, but now you a strong brand for yourself, probably the most recognized brand in the field of genetic research in India. Um, so how did you evolve your personal branding one and then how do you tie it to the organization that you lead now? And I know that you write a lot, so how does that help with building the site and, sure. So I think in the Indian, yeah,

Speaker 6:          06:18          I believe that any brand, whether it's a personal loan or a company, is when you are authentic and true to yourself. So I think what I've done all my life is just to figure out who I am. And uh, so part of our identity as mapped my genome is also noise itself. But it was through a process of understanding and discovering myself that I think I evolved in the beginning. I would say when we started or Simone, which was my first startup, it was primarily to see how do you build the business up in us in an area that we don't know anything about. So part of it was building connections, building relationships, uh, without expecting something from them. And I think I started looking on that in the beginning, but over a period of time, I think it, it sort of evolved. I start, you start doing what you really enjoy most, which is actually saying, what do you get?

Speaker 6:          07:05          You know, what do you like about that particular relationship? So when it was a personal relationship, it was very clear what, what would be expected. But building relationships on, they'd say linkedin or social media was a very different thing. So what a period of time. I think that the world, and I also am a very quirky and a very strange, you know, I have my own strange habits, but I started picking on that. Right? So you say you're, if you're going to, I used to write limericks even in school, uh, but I use that as a process of understanding new subjects. So science was one of the first things when we started, we bought a company in the U S I was trying to explore something in order to summarize, I would start writing. So part of it was just being myself, uh, but you know, just expressing. And I think as we started growing and, uh, it started a divorce. And so I've never really planned to build a story around it, but I think it was just being who I happened and, and I think it's continue to do that. So I think this, just that now that you've been doing it, so many times, people start seeing patterns in it. So that's, that's about it. But I think in the end it was just me.

Speaker 1:          08:10          [inaudible] you said, oh, Noi yourself. And I know the two you speak a lot about uh, uh, your health transformation story, uh, from being an j to really being an entrepreneur of a health startup. And Donna's point of knowing your self view while the spoken about how brand should be a reflection of your value system. Do you want to talk about that? So, um, when I was part of the brand team at et and uh, we actually delve really deep into what a brand is and in the most simple manner that you can break it down. A brand is a series of associations that people have off you. They may be visual, they maybe be process based, but they associate you with a certain set of characteristics. And that's how personal brands a built. And I think

Speaker 3:          08:56          when she said, know yourself, she really put her finger on it because, um, when you build yourself as a brand and as an entrepreneur, you have to do that everyday because of the early stages. Investors, customers invest on the phone. Do they trust the founder? Did. There is no company that is hardly any team that are placing their bets on you and it is that intangible quality, which is your personal brand, which actually leads to that investment, whether it's off a smaller ticket size as a customer or as a large ticket size as an investor. And what I realized is you may want to come across in your personal brand as sophisticated urbane and witty, but you may actually be that person who can sit and have four portfolios of fish courier to go and you should celebrate that because that is what makes you unique.

Speaker 3:          09:44          That is what makes you stand out in a cluttered marketplace. So I'm a decently dressed today, but I have a data blue sense of fashion. My own husband cringes at mine dressing choices and I've always been like that. I've been that way since my college days. But for me and for my investors that's come to stand for how little the regular pursuits off looking good and vanity mean to be. And that says something about who I am. You may not be something that they aspire to or understand, but it makes me very clearly identifiable as a kind of person. And that's what we should do. We should look at what's core to us, not stuff that we really like about ourselves, but which we really are. Take that, spin it and make it work for you. Perfect. So you said, yeah, so you need to do, you brought a very good point. It is like what you are the cord and celebrity also. So those are, I think fundamentals on what we base our brand. So moving to something which is close to all of the Google is working on a remote office and that often comes up. We've heard a lot of infighting branding stories from outside of Google, but close to home. What's the magic mantra? And Google for it, especially growing businesses from a remote location and letting the headquarters know that this is the brand of India. How, how to do it. I'll do

Speaker 5:          11:02          go about it. Yeah. And I, you know, my answer wouldn't be like as much of a talk through strategy because when we started we never really taught that this is what we will achieve. But I think it was a lot around, um, uh, you know, taking in a lot of the opportunities that came in the way. But a few things that, uh, you know, we need to be aware when you are dealing with a remote location and especially Google being a very headquarter centric company, uh, anyone, and this is not just from India, but maybe in a dub in Dublin or in Singapore or anywhere, anywhere else, dependability factor has to be very high. Uh, so, uh, the company is trusting the region or the operations with someone who needs to be very dependable, a aligned, understand the signals and uh, react or act fast.

Speaker 5:          11:53          Right? Uh, so that's one and I think over the PDL, and these are things which might sound as I have a, uh, um, uh, sounding a bit wise, but it's all looking backwards. Um, uh, what I understood from my, um, you know, from others, you know, we have this fantastic Google guys feedback and all that is a few things that have stood out for me is a dependable, perseverant and I'm grounded. I think these are some of the things, and you know, again, back to the point, uh, you know, that our new raised was, you know, be what you are. Uh, you know, many times at Google we have seen different kind of leadership and we ask buyer to or get inspired by certain kinds of leadership. But what I have reconciled pretty early is be what you are. And these are the traits that define me and these are the traits that perhaps helped me function in a global set up, much effective.

Speaker 1:          12:48          And, and that's fair because everybody has their own strengths and areas for development. And really playing to your strength and being authentic is probably the way to go. Uh, you also spoke about reliability and being disciplined, which I think is a score of walking the Moto Mod authors. So we'll talk a little more about it, but back to luxury and luxury, you worked with brand on people and especially storytelling and you self described yourself as a people collectors. We all would like to know what does the tone people collective bead and how do you associate a personal brand with storytelling? Because that's the key to really opposite of that. You know, we, you know, one of the things I love doing is working with people on telling their stories and uh, as everybody said, you know, you want in the conversations to look for what makes them them, you know, and you want to keep that because it's not about making them all sound great. Great.

Speaker 4:          13:39          It's about making them all sound like themselves and be comfortable with it. Um, so that is one thing I learned and it, you know, and actually I learned so much about what I do in my theater than I did in my Mbas. So one of the things they teach you in theater is called playing the opposite, you know, so it's sort of, if you're really angry, you know, you yell and scream, it's one level of being angry. But if you're really like quiet and then you say, you know what, I want to kill you tomorrow. It's like, it's more scary, you know? So I've really learned that because it's sort of as a person, especially when I went to Portland, Oregon where 92% white people, and here I am like this little brown thing. I was the only Indian in like the entire, uh, my professors have ever worked with I think. And they can place me because here I am doing MBA when I do my theater and creative writing and they thought Indians were like very meek and quiet. And here I was like not quite making the and all that stuff. So I'm like playing, you know, so it took me a while to figure it out. But I think playing the opposites, that is an amazing way of building your brand, not playing, but you are multiple things and it's okay to be things. I may wear

Speaker 1:          14:52          a sari and I might swear I'm aware a very western outfit and be completely traditional. So we sometimes often confuse what we try to be with what we are. And I think it's okay to be opposite. And then I'll open it to all four of you. Can you give me an example of where this personal branding and authenticity, like all of you talked about really has helped you in your career? That one point where you said, no, I'm going to completely shun my, what I'm pretending and being from my normal and this is what I am. This is my brand. And it worked for you. Do you have examples?

Speaker 1:          15:36          So I take a shot at it. Um, so when I, when we raised our first round of funding sec, actually third round of funding from roundglass partners that are us based health care. We see, uh, we got APPS, actually, we've got about seven minutes with the founder of the fund. And we drove all the way across town of whole Phalange of us. And they were like 30 of them and if we're all expecting to make up page, and he just walked and he said, why don't we take a walk? And I, my entire team was holding their Max and their presentations and we just took a walk. And in that five minutes he said, tell me a story. So for the second, I was lost. I had the entire 10 slide pitch deck and how much money I wanted to raise. And he's like, tell me your story. And I just told him my story of coming down from 75 kilos back to 50 kilos and why I felt this was something that I could do for the rest of my life because I'd been through a really shitty phase in my life and I wanted to make sure that people didn't have it that shitty. He gave me like exactly seven minutes at the end of it, he says, create, what are we signing the papers?

Speaker 1:          16:38          Uh, I didn't, I really didn't have an answer. And I think at moments like that when you don't have a chance to prepare, when you're expecting something to happen in something totally different happens, you are what you are because there's nothing else you've prepared to be. And that is the truest reflection of who you are and people who can see that and judge it and what would be part of that journey. I think they're very lucky to find those people. And that Prince of good point too, because it was also about self realization because it's very important that all of us understand what we stand for. And it's important for us not to pretend to be what we are. And that realization often we don't spend enough time introspecting and figuring out what are we, what is our strength? Right. Um, so, um, I know you spoke about a means to an end because you spoke about, okay, personal branding is the end, but there is a way you, you're writing has helped to get to that end. What are some of the other things that you have used or tools that you've used or processes we've used to really get clear end goal?

Speaker 1:          17:41          I think, you know, for me the last 16 years at least has been primarily about my two startups. Uh, I also

Speaker 6:          17:50          have two babies, but that you don't grow the babies now. Uh, but, uh, I think for me it was always about saying, you know, you are, you're very encrusted the business, but you were more in grocery chain. How do you build a team and so on. Right? So part of it was building that, that culture, and it's strange because you use, don't realize it, but it's sort of half has an effect on the rest of the people that you have around you. And a, so I was primarily busy and creating that, uh, and not trying to put on any, you know, a different shades to myself and just being who I am when I interview people, you know, you interviewed them as normal people and not have the same set of questions and those kinds of things. So I think part of your identity sort of them sort of builds over to the business as well.

Speaker 6:          18:37          And whether it is mapped my genome where currently I think we have some billion people also, you know, as part of the team and all of that I think comes in because you truly want people to, to become, you know, to create something that you, you wish you can transform the world and to be able to do that. And I think part of that has to do with how you are as, as I know, and as long as you are open to being a saying, I do know I could be completely exposed and still you are, people will want to work for me. I think, you know, that's when you, I think if you can build a good team, right? So I think you need to be honest with yourself and you need to be open and transparent. And I think the moment you do that, I think part of your brand builds around that.

Speaker 6:          19:18          And a lot of that reflection I see near writing because I think you've used that as a means to really convey your branding. And so I, I mean now I've started writing, now I'm not nurses. So for instance, you know, I've have political views, I'll have uh, views on science. I have used on, you know, feminism, I'll have used a lot of different things. Uh, initially I used to be an instigator so I would love to get five people together at Torrisi purchase like though and get people to start talking because when we are in that heated moment, especially when it comes to things like politics or cricket or you know, whatever it is that people have polarizing views on, I think all you need is a little later on I realized that, you know, my job was, you know, it's fun to be an instigator but it's probably more fun if you can actually put some of your, what you really think about something but do it in a non, uh, not a way to really get people to start fighting with each other and understand him.

Speaker 6:          20:15          How do you come up with something creative and, and uh, you know, something that we can all start thinking positively about. Right? So I think I have gone through a lot of transformation in my own life. So your by writing, so also sort of reflect that. So you know, I've written a book on poetry, but if I read through what I wrote in 2010 versus what I liked in 2016, I think that shows the transformation of who, what I have become. And you don't realize it at that point. But part of it is that one of the things is that when I write, I could always go back and see how was I as a person at that point. Right. And then you can verify it with other people who were there around because you might not be the best judge. So I think I've gone through some of that phases that you're seeing. Do you, what do you enjoy people fighting around you and doing that installation versus saying, fine, let's say everything is wrong in the universe today. How do you find the right things in people to be able to say, can we build a better world? So I think that's my transformation and in terms of building the brand that we are building. Great. Okay.

Speaker 4:          21:13          Sorry. I was going to say, I'd say one thing, because I worked in a big company in Intel and Google, I found the best lesson about building who you are, uh, from my boss because you know, in India you're taught that if someone would come to me and say, Lakshmi, you know, you're a great job doing that out. Oh No, no, no, I didn't do it. Like Sam's idea or like, you know, he really helped me or you know, whatever. So an Intel, we had something called ranking and rating where all the bosses have to get together and then they have to fight for which one of their people should get better ranking. So my boss came to me and said, you make it so difficult for me to fight for you. Because anytime I say, look what luxury? Then they said, no, no, she didn't do it.

Speaker 4:          21:52          You know, Sam did it, you know, whatever. So she said, can you please, when someone gives you a compliment, can you please say thank you and shut up, you know, don't say anything else. Because otherwise you're always this mater, you know, like, Oh wow, they're all better than like suddenly you realize, oh, they all left me. And like, you know, I'm sitting here being the martyr, you know? So I think especially women, and maybe I'm generalizing to a lot, Indian women have this whole martyr syndrome of I have to be the one to take care of my in laws I have to do and take care of kids. I'm the one who has to stay home too. I'm the one who has to do everything. I, we just get rid of the crap and you know, and so I always say there are three things is that you need to show up because unless you show up, nothing will come your way.

Speaker 4:          22:38          Next thing you are to speak up or ask for it. When I brought her to India, I went to Chris and I said, we should do this. It was like, wow, okay. If it was, if I didn't ask, it's an not an idea that would have come to him and then shut up. You know, we should know, show up, speak up, shut up, we should know when to do what. And we always do the wrong things at the wrong time. So no one to show up, no one to speak up and know when to shut up, you know? So I think that bills who you are it, you know, and, and the times when you speak up, everybody may not like you, but that's okay. The people who like you will really stick with you. The others don't matter anyway. So you know, the three s

Speaker 2:          23:15          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          23:20          take back the three s Beacopp uh, funny shops pick up and shut up. That's the great thing. I need to reflecting on that. Go ahead. Go ahead. It's not just a good thing. [inaudible] you know, typically in our middle class upbringing, you're supposed to be always look up to your elders, you know, treat everyone

Speaker 5:          23:46          with reverence and sometimes it does just doesn't work. Yeah. And my first brush was that coming from a very middle class background, I was put into sales and that to up not in the country, but nobody will live in Luke up to you unless you give a few expletives. Right. Um, so, you know, it was like a cultural shock and a functional shock as well in sales. And then you literally, you have to show up to make yourself, you have to speak up to ask for the money. Yeah. And then finally you have to shut up once you've got the order because after that, if you start justifying, then you are,

Speaker 1:          24:28          it's a good dog three months. Right. Absolutely. Okay. Thank you for that. Um, so I need to do, you also spoke about consistency, reliability, dependability for the brand as a brand for the region. Uh, how did it go about doing it? Was it, once you identify the dependability is what Hydro Bot will stand for? How do you go about really building that top of mind recall? Yeah, I think, um,

Speaker 5:          24:55          you know, you have to look at it from, uh, you know, and it has evolved over a period of time. If I were to look at overall Google's business or go global operations from India, I think initially when we started off the operations, it was more like providing scale. Um, viva growing crazy. Uh, we just ran out of people in the bay area, right? And I think that's how we came to India and just to take care of the growth and the scale, but that can't be a value proposition beyond the point. And very soon we realized that and then we started consolidating and looking as what are we here for? So it was a bit of a soul searching after having expanded operations. And that's where in I think the realization happened that, you know, you need to be very clear of the value that you're providing as an organization.

Speaker 5:          25:44          And over the period, I think we shifted it from just providing resources and providing transactions and providing support to really pivoting around expertise and what we uniquely bring for Google in India to India. Right. And I think the answer was very evident for us, right? Let's leave this amazing talent that's available in country, in know country. And Google is all about a lot around analytical skills, around data driven decisions. And we have that in plenty. So if you have processes that effectively leverage is this on top of it, the fabulous technical talent that we have, we have a very winning proposition. So I think that's been the journey and whether you take whichever function, um, you know, whether it is Gtech or trust and safety, RSM, we, we have been trying to leverage that and get it to the maximum.

Speaker 1:          26:37          And that's a fair point because we always tell the teams that your personal branding for stops with you individually, then it goes to your team and then it goes to the larger organization. So you consistently have to build on all the three, uh, some good point on that a little are you keep talking about using digital media consistently to check on your brand and your individual brand as well as your organization's brand. And as a part of my work and trust and safety, our team's constantly educate people on leaving a digital footprint. What are you really leaving behind when you're talking? Because we've had, we educate kids in schools and we say that you're leaving something on your Facebook or on your Google plus account or anywhere linkedin and seven, eight years later, there is a recruiter who's doing a background check on you and they find that you have very polarized political view or very polarized individual, uh, views. And then they say, oh, this is not going to match to our organizational culture. So we really teach people on how they shouldn't be leaving a digital footprint that does not work for them. So how do you evaluate that?

Speaker 3:          27:47          So a couple of years ago, um, I actually came to the realization that Facebook is the biggest brand building tool available to you for your personal branding space. Every photograph you put out there, every status update, every comment on a colleague sort of friends or a family member's post is sending view up, sending the world a very clear view of who you are and what you believe in. We share stuff randomly. I, I recently got an update from Facebook. They're in the last year. I've shared some 9,000 things. I was like, where do I get the time to do it? But I've done it. The problem is we don't realize that there is now no boundary between your professional life and your personal life. It is all one fluid, seamless hole and everybody at all times is judging you. So you know, only the paranoid survive. Anybody and everybody who is looking at your life, whether it's your best friend, your spouse, your children, your colleagues, your workmates, your investors, they are all watching you.

Speaker 3:          28:48          Do not think anything you put out there is being ignored and therefore you have a duty to yourself to speak. Could, you know, show up and speak up. But most importantly to shut up. I think in personal branding on the digital space, one of the strongest things that you can do is stop yourself. Stop yourself from sharing that status update. Stop yourself from sharing that personal low that you're going through. Stop yourself from calling your husband out. He has pissed you off because the world is watching. The moment you realize that the world is watching and it will have repercussions, you will automatically start controlling what you put out there and controlling is the first aspect to building our brand.

Speaker 1:          29:32          That's a good point. It's a luxury. Coming back to you, I know you worked with a lot of people in the industry in building the brand and helping them make a story and they're all low. Some of them are working in organizations, some of them in Ngos. How do you feel, what does the common story in terms of building their brand for everyone? You know, as I said, one of the things I always look for is was what is it that makes them them? You know, actually when we were all kids, we were just perfect. We are just ourselves. And then through the years you learn what not to do and then we have this facade of, you know, like for example I'm sitting in this chair, I don't know if it's just like this that's just like this, that's it. Like this. Which you know, you're like, your mind is wandering through 10 different things cause you want to look perfect and right.

Speaker 1:          30:19          And what I try to work with people on, you know, be comfortable with your imperfections because that's your greatest tool. The point is that we focus on trying to be perfect so much that we are not in love with who we are. And I think, you know, in my conversations with people, I try, because it happens with everyone. You talk to them in our first like there is this very, this very focused, or I want to talk about the four ways to blah or six ways to play or something like that. And then, you know, you kind of get a little, get a little and then they suddenly something gets where they become children when they're talking about it. Oh, you know, but when we were building this product, we did this and then we did that. And then you're like, ah, that's what it is.

Speaker 1:          31:03          The place where you become a child, you, you know, you don't care what you look like or how you sound like that's who you are and everyone has that. You know, you just need to find that and bring that out and say it's okay to be like this. Yes, I know you're this big deed president or whatever. But it's okay to be that here because there are tenicity referring back to what you were saying. Um, it's most important. And I also tell them there's another thing I learned in theater is that like for example, if you're in a play, you forget a line or something, you're just beating yourself over the head, right? But you know what? The audience has no clue. Only you know that you miss something. So I tell them, look what if you forget a line or whatever. Nobody knows. Nobody is judging you. You know, just be yourself. If you forget something, just keep going. And there's a lot we can fix in editing, you know, so, so, you know, be, so I think a lot of the story telling a lot of the personal brand building is to find that those imperfections in you and being extremely comfortable with them and try not to be perfect because a perfect person is the most boring to watch. Torquey totally agree.

Speaker 1:          32:18          I know moving to your wife, I know a lot of the audience, so what is about negotiation, because I think this is a tome we have a lot of courses on negotiation and people's life is all about negotiation from Atkins to your organization, to your managers, to your peers. You're always negotiating. How did your negotiation involved in, through your career and you've spoken about something, uh, from

Speaker 6:          32:40          being a selfish negotiator to a selfless negotiators. Do you want to talk about that suddenly? So one, uh, I'm a minority, so it's in my DNA. It's part of our upbringing. But I thought maybe a couple of stories that, uh, that, that sure. How I've transformed a would be interesting. Uh, when I graduated from a University of Illinois in the graduate school, typically they didn't do campus placement, but during our time, I think we got, I got offers on the phone and stuff like that, but there was this one that we got on campus. It was a bank called First Chicago and they sent a letter to three of us, um, giving us a job. Right? So I don't remember, it was like 30, $40,000 a year. I don't remember the exact figure. But anyways, so the HR sends me an email and you know, the other two people accept.

Speaker 6:          33:29          I instantly responded back saying, you have no idea who you send this offer to. You have no understanding of my worth. And it was, I don't remember the exact words, but it was primarily saying that you have no clue who you're talking to. You better give me a better offer. Right. And within five minutes I get a call back from HR. They were shocked. They were like, they never heard anyone say something like this before. And, uh, any, she called me and said, you should never say something like this, this, that, but by the way of my vice president wants to meet you. So I went the next day and they increase my offer by $5,000, uh, just because of that email. But I didn't join them anyway, but, but it was a, you know, when I think back, I don't have that email. It was a, it was that time of my life when I was extremely arrogant.

Speaker 6:          34:18          Um, and it was, it was my way of negotiating at that point. And, and I thought it was perfectly fine over a period of time, I think, uh, I continued to negotiate in every form we take your Ip, you know, but like one of my, uh, classmates in the class on negotiation in Harvard did, we all were kept in three d multiple groups. When we came out, he said, my God, I thought, you know, you will, I got the best deal here when I come out. I find that I'm the most crude, but you know, but I think what I have evolved into is to be able to say that if you really want to get the best outcomes, it's more important to understand heart, what it means to them also. So the best deals will be done if you also understand what your open at once.

Speaker 6:          35:01          And I think that comes in with a very open view of being able to do this. I've also gone in the middle through this phase where we had to deal with an investor. We were acquiring a company for which we are raising money. Um, they, uh, it was a very, very tight timeline. We were acquiring a public company. There was a certain time in which you could do it. We had no money to otherwise buy it. But the way we had to negotiate there was to walk away and, and I, and we got it. But today I think in most cases, whether it's negotiating with an employee, whether it's negotiating with anybody, I first tried to understand what the, what it means to them. Um, and I think once you understand them, then I think it's easy to anchor and to be able to get the right pieces in, in together.

Speaker 6:          35:44          So I think that has shown that, you know, I've gone through the phases of life where you started hard negotiation towards being a, to be able to say, how do you get the best out of everybody? That's a good point. I know because a lot of time when you're negotiating and you're thinking that they are, the arpanet always has an opposing the requirement. They don't, you probably talking different languages. Would you want the same thing? So really sitting and talking, having a fair dialogue helps you really achieve that. So a, and I would just, uh, during lunch discussing, there is a research done by a lady called Linda [inaudible] who saw a third of women don't ask. And they find that 7% of the women, uh, attempted to negotiate a new job offer, whereas 57% of men always negotiate a job offer. So she did a little more research on why women don't negotiate. And one of the things is women feel that they suffer from a reputational risk when the negotiate, how are they perceived when they negotiate? So, uh, what is your impression of this research?

Speaker 3:          36:49          This is not something that I'm generally speaking about. Um, we in our investor portfolio, I'm one of the, as my investor ports around the most Chiney people. So he basically tells me the first board meeting we had, I remember he came, we had the whole session and then he said, you know that all of the other portfolio companies I've been telling them to reign in their spending with you, I'm thinking, you please step up your spending. So I said, I will, but can you give me some more money first? And he's like, I've already given you money. I said, but I'm not comfortable spending till I have more money in the bank. So you give me money, then I'll spend. So they gave me money. See, I didn't know it. He said, my God, you take asking for money to a whole different level. And that's when I told him, I said, I learned this in my career the hard way.

Speaker 3:          37:33          Women negotiating two ways and they're still distinct patterns of behavior. How we negotiate. You negotiate a certain way when you have something in your hand and you negotiate a different way when you don't have something in your hand. So if you have to job, job offers, you see how you go and negotiate with the new guy. We full been [inaudible] not [inaudible], you don't have a job offer. So please not three there though. And the one thing that you know, my dad always told me, he's like always going like you have another offer on the table cause he doesn't know. You don't have another offer on the table when you're going to say, Eh, it's not happening. It's in Dev. We'll say no. That's another thing women do. Women either say yes or they say no. A lot of successful negotiators never seen no, there's, you know, I think we can do better.

Speaker 3:          38:25          You know, let's work on this a little bit. They will never say no. They will never stop and walk away. They were, in her case, it worked and you don't touch wood, it works. But in most cases, if you just keep the interest alive and keep pushing, keep pushing, keep pushing, you will eventually get to a what? What's most importantly behave like you have another offer in your hand. They don't know any better. No, that's, that's a very fair point because you always always have an option if not this, you have an option. Options always come and a yeah, we tend to say yes or no and we need to get into the gray zone. Why the men have a problem with asking. I don't personally suffer from that problem. People listening, it has that and the research also says they associated with the reputational risk. Like they ass

Speaker 4:          39:18          asked too many times. You call aggressive, you know, I mean you have to deal with labels and I think we, somewhere in the bottom of our hearts, we all want to be liked by everybody. We don't want to be called. Yeah. Oh, that aggressive or just very, very upset. He said, Oh, you know, when she's so sweet, she's so, we want to hear those things. Be a good girl. It'd be a good girl. Yeah. So like you want to be universally like, I mean, mine is, apple was always the opposite problem to her. I'm like this completely useless teleco man, you know, can ask for anything. So it's like, it's always like, oh yeah, take care, take care of. They don't, it's like, I'll do it for free as a show up. I mean, it's sort of like this, and I learned this from somebody.

Speaker 4:          40:02          One speaker I was talking to to come here and then he said, oh, I would love to come to India. And it's the only thing is I need $100,000 donation to my NGO only then I'll show up. I'm like, wow. Uh, it also, but he was like, he's pretty good. He said, it's not for me, but if I'm, and he said something very interesting. He said, if you want to say joy, don't do anything for money, but if you do something, you are, you get paid. You know, it's sort of like you don't need to do it for it, but somebody should value your time. So I think I've learned that now when someone asks, okay, you donate something to our foundation, then I'll come. It doesn't matter, they donate five rupees or 500,000 it doesn't matter what you're doing and show me. And then I'll say, I'll tell them that I was, you know what?

Speaker 4:          40:49          You think I'm worth it. I'm watching kind of a thing. But I think some of it is finding the balance. If you're the one who's like, you know, who didn't have any fear or the rain and if you're the one who was kind of very awkward asking, you should push yourself. It's amazing what you get when you ask. I am always amazed by it. I'm like, Oh really? Okay. And that's fair. We should always be asking. It gives a word to your dog. And one more thing I want to say is the thing I've always learned that helps me as a tactic. Pretend that you look like everybody around in the room, you know? So if I'm in with, you know, especially at Intel, most of the things is like 15 white guys and me. And I think I look like a white guy. I mean I don't think I look like anything different. And I think I talked like them and then I move into a room off, you know, 2015 year olds, I think I look like them, talk like them. So you just have to think, you look like them, you know, you don't look anything different. You're not anything different. That's a good tip.

Speaker 3:          41:53          Um, so I did, this was for you because as a business leader, you've oftentime made offers to senior leaders in your organization and both men and women. How many times have you seen a woman actually come up and negotiate? You said any incident that sticks out and, or you wish we were hiring more woman because then the opportunity for negotiation,

Speaker 5:          42:22          it's been one of my big objectives here, but he does admit to that 57 versus 7%. I can't get me, I can't remember the exact stats, but men usually nine out of 10 times has ended up in a negotiation with this thing and each one has their own style. One will be like slamming the phone. I have also myself slamming the phone on Google offer, so I completely resonate

Speaker 3:          42:47          working in north India

Speaker 2:          42:49          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          42:54          but the, the, the person whom whom I slammed and I respect her, she is currently the director of HR director, Flipkart. She was the head of recruitment and she was equally aggressive so she didn't call back. And then I'm like, okay,

Speaker 2:          43:08          all right. So,

Speaker 3:          43:11          but uh, but usually

Speaker 5:          43:12          it's the case that, um, men do negotiate a much, much, much, much more. I, and, um, I wish, I, I think, you know, as I was saying that I think it's, it comes to um, this anxiety maybe or some worry factor around, Ooh, if I say no, what would happen? Right, right. Or would it be interpreted in some other way? And that's something, you know, some of the fabulous women leaders that I work with, you know, they used to give it a dab. Yeah. Right. So I think that's the spirit with which we meet too. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          43:48          You know, I, I just wanted to say this one of, I have a very, very, a very esteemed colleagues, the very senior female leader, and she always says, I'm not in this for the money. And I saw disagree with, I think women are a lot of times you'll hear this from women a lot. I'm not doing this for the money. What are you doing it for? Incident to passion and the money. Oh, this consequence. Yes. I think, I think you're wrong. That's a great negotiation tactics.

Speaker 2:          44:15          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          44:25          I'm not doing it for the money, but give me what I want.

Speaker 2:          44:28          Yeah,

Speaker 4:          44:33          yeah. Don't smell bad. I want to say it. You know, especially for women, I worked in the NGO sector, corporate, everything. It's very easy for them to ask for somebody else, but it's very difficult for them to ask for themselves. It's just something, not some women, this is like a psychiatric saying. My friends, I do it all the time. You know? It's so easy for me to walk in and say, my friends, any doctors, none is doing this, give $1 million, and then I'll go in and say, Oh yeah, my Saturday, it doesn't matter. You know what I mean? It's sort of like, but I think we have to get over this thing of it's okay to ask for yourself, your, your health, your money, what you need. There's nothing wrong and asking for it, but it's a, I still have a huge mental block to it.

Speaker 4:          45:14          I feel kind of odd, but I have to. It's sort of like this you hate doing, but you have to do it. It's sort of you pushed yourself. That's one of the things I have to push myself a lot. I mean, people don't know me don't believe that. But I do know one creeped up. I think we got some really good tips. One is pink that you have options when you're negotiating. So that gives you a lot more power to negotiate, ask because we don't ask, you will never know what they're getting. And Paul does believe in your value because if you believe that you are vulnerable, the other person when started believing that you're valuable. So asked with that.

Speaker 5:          45:50          Can I just add one to that? And this is a very Google centric view maybe. Uh, and this is beyond salary. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, it's, I think, uh, in the business context and you know, we are negotiating every day. I think what has worked for me a significantly is, uh, and what I keep saying all our leaders is where that one Google hat, because, uh, today you are representing this function. Tomorrow you're representing that part of the business. But if you, and I say that, that, you know, step back and if you were familiar, very few are so under what we'll do. We did thinking about it. And then suddenly it makes you open up with a lot of possibilities and u s and that's where the new connect with your opponent or your adversary, whatever objective you want to port. But that's where in the meeting ground kind of happens because many a time I think we are negotiating but we are all on two different pages and the the, the, the Twain shall never meet kind of a syndrome. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          46:46          Which, which is a question what is right for the users, what's right for, yeah, exactly. Not Fair. Um, so I think we, we ready to close, but I do want to open it up to audience questions. But before I do, I just want to talk about, just summarize thinks that, uh, everybody has said, so I know you spoke about personal branding, evolving, building it on your strength and building a consistent story and you do that through your poems, poetry writing to, you spoke about using digital media and writing as well and really working on people perception value system and pushing us forward. A great anecdotes there as well. Um, you've always, I, we've even in the past when we beat in meetings to always spoken about Google as a brand, Google hydropower bot as a brand and spoken about pos system can asking for a consist and consistently asking for the right message, which is dependency and dependability and luxury. You have been amazing in terms of working on story telling with people and really all, all the anecdote you gave about being authentic and being out there. Before we close, I just wanted to each of you to give one thing that you'd like a corporate audience too.

Speaker 5:          48:03          Oh, you live with,

Speaker 4:          48:06          I think I always look for, it doesn't matter. Corporate audience or whoever. I think it's wonderful to find amazing heroes around. Doesn't celebrate them. So one of the things that bugs made when we say who's your role model? All our role models, a western or the cricketers are there film people? We don't look at amazing stories that are happening around us. And I think instead of looking for inspiration somewhere else, I think the inspiration is right around you. And I think it's the person who comes, works in your house, your neighbor, you know, your local grocer, whatever it is. I think we need to find great stories around us. That's what I,

Speaker 5:          48:45          I value. I know.

Speaker 1:          48:48          Uh, I think it's most important that you know who you are well and if you need to help him, that will help you do it with a genetic test.

Speaker 2:          48:57          Very smart.

Speaker 3:          49:03          So what I'll share here is not necessarily for a corporate audience, but it worked for me because I'd spent 14 years in corporates. Um, there's a lot of things that we all want to achieve in life. A lot of us have bucket lists in the stuff we want to do. We always wondering about how it's going to pan out, where we going to be, how is life going to play out? I just, I keep one more time for myself itches every two, three years. I see. What do I really want to be good at? What do I really want to be good at, right. Kick asset. And then how do I figured out how to do that. And that's why my life has been fairly exciting because every three years I say, now what do I really want to be? Kick ass? I know. I figured out how to be kick ass at it. It just keeps life exciting and why? So figuring out what you want to be really good at and then I'm figuring out how to get there, the journey to be interesting. Huh?

Speaker 5:          49:53          Okay. Yeah. I think, uh, somebody is a be who you are, uh, be self aware and, um, you know, live with your strengths rather than Franklin on your ads that just focus on your strength and God alone. Correct.

Speaker 1:          50:11          Thank you so much. Thank you. [inaudible] one Lakshmi. We've been trying to get them for a long time, but finally we could get the schedules to match. Really, really appreciate the time you've taken to talk to Googlers. Thank you.

Speaker 2:          50:23          [inaudible].
