Speaker 1:          00:08          Good afternoon. My name is Amin huck. And uh, when I was growing up, when I was young, when I was in school, I used to stammer quite a bit. I would stammer, I would stutter and uh, I would trail off mid sentence. I will not finish off my sentences. I realize I'm not the only one who does that. There are quite a few who do that. Uh, but it took me some fine too. You know, took some time to find that reassurance that I'm not the only one. Uh, so when I was growing up, I used to stay a lot at home. I was a little shy. I was a little result. I would not go out and play with other kids as much as I'd like to. And what do you do when you stay at home and spend more time at home than most people do? I remember two things very distinctly. We used to talk a lot, real conversations, but talk a lot.

Speaker 2:          01:09          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:09          we do that sometimes when we don't have electricity, but we don't have that comfort anymore. Power backup kicks in when we used to talk a lot about everything. The second thing I used to do a lot was that I used to read a lot and I used to lead, uh, uh, a lot of stories, not math or science. I may have been somewhere else if I was reading math or science. Uh, but I'm, I'm over indexed on stories, uh, the same stories that you read, but you know, I could win a quiz on, in regil comics and down and it was a bigger fan of in the Gel comics then how much, it's like a terrible, I started off within the Gel comics and the usual stories that we all grew up on. [inaudible] Janda, Mama, Amr, cheese, terracotta, and uh, there is a hierarchy that we all follow, don't we? Uh, if you've grown up in India at a particular point of time, most of us follow that hierarchy. You move on from these stories too famous by even secret seven. And then from famous five and secret seven, you'll move onto hardy boys and Nancy

Speaker 2:          02:08          juice.

Speaker 1:          02:11          Nancy Drews let's clap for my friend. You know, there are a few men

Speaker 2:          02:16          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:20          there are very few men who have the courage to add and a large gathering that they've read some Nancy Drews. I read some Wilson Boon as well. Okay,

Speaker 2:          02:37          let's clap for my friend here.

Speaker 1:          02:42          And I totally enjoyed reading the, the few that I did. And then I moved on to Westerns Louis L'amour the callback classics and by Grade Seventh, you know, uh, I remember in grade 17, I was in Kansas with La and uh, in Kansas Medallia we had recommended reading as part of recommended reading. Another trick with recommended reading is that it's not part of curriculum, it's not part of syllabus. Nobody's going to ask you questions in exams based on that. So as we say in Hindi, there is a phrase up Kesha de [inaudible], which basically means read it if you'd like. Uh, but I was reading Ramayana and this was not a much to Catherine minor. This was proper Rama and this was take Romano in difficult Hindi. And in grade eight recommended reading was the Mahabharata and I was reading the Maha Martha, which had my mom freaking out and terribly worried about me.

Speaker 1:          03:34          Normal kids don't do that. So all of deep concern and out of anxiety for me, she enrolled me into speech therapy, into elocution, into debate competitions, into poetry, the citation into the drama club, like comprehensive damage control strategy. I am really grateful to her for that. I'm very grateful to her for that because all of these things together helped me a lot. And out of all of these things, I fell in love with theater and I wanted to do nothing but theater. I wrote my first play and it was a copy, I must admit. Uh, but I wrote my first play when I was in grade ninth. I directed it, I directed my friends and I participated in it as well. Uh, and if some of you, I can see the expressions, wow, that seems like an early start. If there's anything that describes that play, a pathetic might be an understatement.

Speaker 1:          04:29          And there are many people who are walking this planet still scarred by that experience. But you know how good teachers are. My teachers are fantastic. They said, I mean, what you're doing is wonderful. Do more. They had no idea that I would take up their advice seriously and they will have to suffer a lot after that. But I, I continue doing more and I did much more in, uh, in high school. I did much more theater in college than most kids do. And that's what I really wanted to do. But you know how it is growing up in middle class India, you don't choose extra curricular activities. At least that's how it was when I was growing up. Uh, and it still is the same. We don't choose extracurricular activities as professional choices. We choose what our percentage is, allow us to do and there's a strict hierarchy there.

Speaker 1:          05:19          Uh, so to cut a long story short, I did buy a, did a course in business administration, worked in sales, and then I got lucky to get into one of the best advertising schools in India at that point of time and institute. And I'm the bug and we had wonderful campus placement. So one of the world's best advertising agencies at that point of time. And even now at this point of time, Ogilvy and Mather came to campus pick me up and I moved to boom by advertising Mecca and I started earning my own salary now that I was making money. Within a week of moving to Mumbai, I joined the theater group and these two tracks that I had a deer track and I had an evening track. They track advertising, evening track theater, kind of define my journey over the next 18 years of my life.

Speaker 1:          06:08          So I moved from advertising to marketing. I was head of marketing for Louis Phillippe. Uh, and then I moved from marketing to consulting, specifically brand strategy consulting, go to market strategies, uh, India entry strategy. How do you increase your market share? How do you come out to premium for your brand brand strategy? Not If these were my day tracks, my evening tracks, what theater, poetry as a student of cinema and as a photographer. And if there was any one thread that know if there was a single thread that sort of know combined or sort of, you know, that was common between both of these tracks of my life. It was the fact that I was dealing with stories and narrative in both of them and working with stories in both of these, I realize that, you know, we don't leverage stories in our work as much as we can and we don't leverage stories in education as much as we can and with a desire to address that.

Speaker 1:          07:07          I plunged into the world of storytelling as a story coach, as a story consultant. And what we're going to do today is we're going to look at business storytelling specifically, what are the principles of business storytelling? How can we tell better stories about our products if there are a couple of frameworks that we could use and how to build a bank of stories. That's what we're going to do. So let's go straight, uh, into this. You know what I'm going to do is I'm going to share a, we do have with you now, it may seem at first glance that this video has nothing to do with business, but we will look at it with a business lens and we will see this from a business lens. Now this guy that you see here, uh, he has a business issue. He puts out an elevator pitch, a business message and that doesn't work. And then he gets some help and magic happens. We look at that and see what are the principles we can derive from that. And I'll walk you through business storytelling principles that we can derive from this film. So let's take a look at this film.

Speaker 1:          08:06          Okay?

Speaker 2:          08:14          Okay. What did you do to my same, I've seen different words. Excellent. Hmm.

Speaker 1:          09:39          No, I'm not an expert on morality, on ethics of begging. So we are going to look at this in a very objective sense. You know this guys in business, he has an elevator pitch. That pitch doesn't seem to resonate well with the audiences. They are just passing them by and then the lady comes and changes the message and magic happens. What are the principles that we can derive from this in terms of storytelling? The first one is that stories speak to people's emotions. And we know this, that there are two sides to the brain, the logical side of the brain, the rational side of the brain and the feelings and the emotional side of the brain. And there are decisions, decision scientists who've been studying a very important question that all business leaders want to understand, oh, this is the question. How do people decide when faced with choices, when faced with alternatives, how do we make a choice and what swings the decision in favor of a versus B?

Speaker 1:          10:41          If there are two candidates for they know they are too, too lightly can candidates for the CEO position, how does the board decide, uh, given both the candidates look equal? No. From Ivy School, from Ib School, 20 years in business, 20 years in business, has worked in three geographies, has worked in three geographies, has worked in three departments, has worked in freedom. But departments has a wonderful track record like to like know how does the board choose between a candidate was as B, how do we choose between Colgate and Pepsodent and how do we choose between vendor a was his window be? How do people decide? And and decision science has revealed to us that in almost all kinds of decisions, the emotional side of the brain is predominant. And stories speak to emotions. And I'll talk about facts and I'll talk about numbers and I'll talk about data and how storytellers leverage that because you know, it's in this world, uh Oh, where we have more and more data, it actually makes the rules of stories even more important because when we are inundated with data, where we are inundated with information from all sides, it's even more important that focus on narrative because narrative helps us make sense of that data.

Speaker 1:          11:57          So speak to people's emotions and when you speak to people's emotions it gathers and it results in a higher response. But Roi is higher when you speak to people's emotions. The second one is build common ground. And uh, it's interesting that the first word that has guy used on that poster was I, that's not a great place to start your stories. But if you look around lots of corporate stories, a lot of organizations, stories, lot of sales stories start from I, lot of product pitchers start from I, this is my product, this is my idea, this is what I have done. I is not a great place to start because you know, I presumes that you know, in my, what I'm interested in is something that you are interested in as well. But she doesn't make that assumption and she starts by building common ground.

Speaker 1:          12:51          And that common ground here is, it's a beautiful day. You can see that. And when you see that you are not in agreement. Yes, it's a beautiful day. That's magical watch he is doing here is getting our audience to nod in agreement. And when your audience starts nodding in agreement, you are in a better place to sell them something. So get your audience nodding in agreement by building common ground. Next principle and all storytellers use this either intuitively or consciously, is build contrast. Contrast is one of the most powerful devices in storytelling, uh, day and night. Rich and poor, good versus bad, hero versus villain. It's in the world of contrasts that story's live and stories evoke that world of contrast. Now, when we worked with new products, what we, we have fertile ground for contrast because new products operate in the realm of what is versus what can be.

Speaker 1:          13:58          Now that's a powerful contrast between waters and what can be. So don't limit yourself to the contrast of the problem and the solution, which is the typical trap that a lot of stories fall to see beyond and see what you can do. Uh, in terms of contrast, in terms of exploring what is possible today versus what can be possible in terms of what can be done today versus what can be done in some ways when we are building new products, you're building the new world. When you're building new products, you're building a new kind of world, paint a picture of that world because what you want to do is not just at a literal level, get people to use that product. What you want to do is you are selling citizenship to a new world, to a new planet, and you want people to raise hand and say, we want to be citizens of that world. So paint a picture of that world and describe that world at contrast with today's world.

Speaker 3:          14:57          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          14:57          you that contrast and she uses that beautifully here.

Speaker 1:          15:03          She uses it beautifully in an emotional sense. She uses it beautifully when she says, and she uses it in a positive sense. This guy was operating from a place called sympathy, but she is not operating from sympathy. She's operating from empathy. That's a powerful position to operate from. That guy is saying, look at me, you know I am in a sorry state, please help me. But why she saying is she's, there's a powerful flip happening here. She is not saying how bad, look at me, how bad I am, you know my, my condition is really bad. You need to help me. Instead she is saying you have not paused and life to think about this, but take a moment to think about this. You have eyes, you can see that's a powerful flip. You can see she makes you feel better. And that's the switch that I'm talking about from sympathy to empathy n and then she establishes the fact that there was a big divide between what you can see but icon.

Speaker 1:          16:04          And that contrast is, you know, it's implied in the earlier pitch, but here it's explicit. So you need to draw and build on that contrast. And that's what she does. It's a very powerful tool of storytelling. See, when you are building new products and telling the story of those new products, how you can leverage contrast. And I say this that a beautiful definition of storytelling for me, particularly business storytelling, but in for for all kinds of storytelling really is truth. Well told. No, I'm not a big fan of definitions. I never was a big fan of definitions in school, but I like this because there are two parts, two stories. First, all stories must come from truth because if they are coming from a place called falsehood, then those two are going to have a very short shelf life. We've seen that with enough stories that tried to leverage false hood. They couldn't go far,

Speaker 3:          17:00          okay?

Speaker 1:          17:00          So so far someone has a very short shelf life in life, but more particularly. So in business stories, they have to come from a place called authenticity. Stories have to be authentic. Stories have to be truthful. They have to be based on fact that they have to be based on data and that data has to be truthful.

Speaker 3:          17:18          Okay?

Speaker 1:          17:18          But as we saw in this example, truth alone isn't enough. That guy was telling the truth, I'm blind, please help. But it doesn't work. It needs to be stated beautifully. That's why truth has to meet well told and that well-told is articulation. That well-told his presentation that well-told is visualization. That well-told his use of metaphor is use of contrast when will happens to and and meet Strut. Then it becomes a story which is why we've seen this in life. It's not what you say alone that matters but how we say it that makes all the difference. There are people who've said no to you and your friendship with them has broken and there are others who have said no to you and you're still friends with them and the differences, how they said it. There are other like I could give you another example. There's a, there's a boss you worked with and during performance appraisal he gave you honest feedback and it was critical feedback and he told you the areas that you were lacking in and you came out crying and you hated that guy and you never want to work with that boss ever again.

Speaker 1:          18:33          And under performance appraisal. Another guy shares the same feedback with you and points out inadequacies, but does it in a manner that when you come out, you feel so happy that you want to work with this guy all your life. It's not what you say, but how you say it that makes all the difference. So, so look at both. Often in storytelling we look at content, but we forget how are we going to communicate that content. The way that content lines is as important as the content itself. It's not just the fact or the data alone, but how you're bringing that fat alive that makes all the difference. So explore that in your stories and lost. You know, a lot of damage has been done to business storytelling by something called CTA, call to action. And we try to close all our stories by emphasizing the call to action.

Speaker 1:          19:29          But don't state the obvious when you can see that begging bowl there, we can see that the bar there, that's the call to action. You don't need to spell it out. You don't need to tell people what needs to be done. And you don't need to say put $5 here because you could be excluding the possibility of somebody putting $20 there. So don't, don't get too excited by CTA. Use it very judiciously. You know, CTA is not call to action is, has almost become a mandatory and the user like a mandatory put the mandatories which are there, which are required to be put in. But think about what is mandatory and what is not. And don't state the obvious. Now we work, you know, you know, there are firms like KPMG and Deloitte, there are audit phones, right? You could think of us and the work that I do, the work that we do at story Weller's, uh, is we audit stories and we audit presentations.

Speaker 1:          20:23          And you'll be surprised to see how much, uh, of, of Vias we come across in presentations that is not required there. One of the best ways, you know, easiest ways to make presentations better is to remove the obvious from presentation. It's not by adding, but by removing that, sometimes we make our stories better. See what you can remove from your stories and those stories will come out far beautifully. Now, you know, if you look at universal story structures and say, how do I leverage this for the product that I'm building? I work on a product team. You know we are, we are looking at this particular innovation and and, and we believe that this is going to change the world. How do I cheat? How do I take, go out and tell the story of this product? How do I communicate it internally to stakeholders?

Speaker 1:          21:08          How do I get buy in? How do I get a budget on this project? How do I buy it? You know, our, our deadline extension on this project. How do I tell the story of this product? All stories come from a universal story structure, which is fairly simple. There's a character in a story, there's conflict and there is resolution. Central to a story is conflict. When there is no conflict, there is no story. So let me say this again. If there is no conflict, there is no story. One of the ways to look at conflict as the same problem, right? It's a simpler word is problem. Boy loves girl. Girl loves boy and they live happily ever after. Nobody seen that story.

Speaker 1:          21:50          Nobody's written that book. Nobody's seen that movie. But boy loves girl. Girl loves boy and father says naive. Yes, shoddy may Osec team know and there's a story there without a conflict, there is no story. If the quarter was had given to ponder was what was rightfully theirs, we wouldn't have had the Mahabharata. If, if Ramona had not kidnapped sita, we won't have had the law mine. If there's no conflict, there is no story. Now that's a universal story structure. How do we leverage it in business and how do we sort of, you know, how do we take that and bring it into the world of business? For me it's way simple. Without a conflict there is no business because an entrepreneur looks at conflict as a problem in consumers lives and he says the flip side of that is an opportunity for an entrepreneur, for an innovator, for a pioneer.

Speaker 1:          22:48          And when you resolve that, then there is a story in play and if you can't resolve it then it's not a great story. So do you see this innovation and story, business and story have the same structure now keeping this at the back of your mind, let's see how you know, let me share with you a simple framework using which we can tell the stories of our products, any kind of product, any kind of innovation that we are building. And that structure is fairly simple. I talked about contrast earlier and the way to paint a picture of that world is to use something like this and fill in the blanks and say, imagine a world where Dash Dash, dash what kind of a world do you envision with the kind of product that you are building? What will happen in that world? What would people do that they don't do today?

Speaker 1:          23:42          Or what can people do that they are not able to do today? What do you see in that world? Describe that world way. Simply use contrast, use metaphor. Bring that world alive in a way that is inspiring so that people raise their hand and say, I want to be a citizen of that world. Let me give an example from a non tech perspective. Dow uh, you know, globally said that, you know, there is a big conflict. What does, you know, so brands, products, innovations, ideas have to resolve conflicts. They've said, hey, there's a big conflict. Every morning millions of women around the world wake up and when they look at themselves in the mirror, they are not happy with what they see. They see themselves as themselves and they are not happy with what they see. And that's a big conflict. They are not happy because the world of beauty, the world of fashion, the world of cosmetics is telling them that you are not beautiful.

Speaker 1:          24:37          You are not beautiful. The lady on Vogue, she is beautiful. The lady on Cosmopolitan, she is beautiful. The lady on Feminine, she is beautiful. The radio on red carpet. She is beautiful. The lady in Hollywood, she is beautiful but you aren't. And there's a big distance between where you are and where they are. And she sees that distance and she said, that's impossible for me to achieve. And when you see that in possibility and say, hey, it's beyond me, you feel bad about where you are because somebody else has taken ownership of the beauty story and said, this is what beautiful is. Now that's a big conflict. How do they resolve it? Or how are they trying to resolve it? By taking ownership of the story of beauty and rewriting that story. So a possible articulation for them could be, imagine a world where beautiful is the body we are born with is the way I look right now.

Speaker 2:          25:45          [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          26:49          well that's one kind of an example, right? You don't need a tech product, you don't need, sometimes all you need is insight into what a big conflict is. And once you identify a conflict that is large enough for people, uh, that people face, then you will find a solution. And that solution can be a product, can be communication, that solution can be a service. Uh, there are many kinds of solutions that are possible, right? But then you have to tell the story, uh, of that product for people to want to be citizens of that world. And you're a tell that story again and again, and you will tell that story and pitch that story to really stake holders and contextualize it to them over a period of time. And you have to refresh that story as well. Now that story can work. You know, this framework is a beautiful framework.

Speaker 1:          27:33          Imagine a world where it works for all kinds of products. So to give you an example from a very different kind of a world, you are familiar with the game scrabble, right? [inaudible] a game that helps you build vocabulary. Now that's really simple, right? You know, uh, imagine a world where people hired Richard vocabularies. Now that's a big conflict in life. Our vocabularies are shrinking. And then I go back to the principles of business, toy dealing. There's truth and there is well tuned to be able to articulate something well. It remember, it's not just what you say, but how you say it. We need Witcher vocabularies. That's the tool. Let's do retailers work with. Look around you. Leaders, business leaders have richer vocabularies then followers. Political leaders have richer vocabulary is and followers. Spiritual leaders have richer vocabulary than followers. There's a straight correlation. It's simple correlation.

Speaker 1:          28:30          If you want to be a good storyteller, billyo vocabulary, build your verbal vocabulary, language, vocabulary, visual vocabulary, oral vocabulary bill, but build your vocabulary right now. Imagine a world where people had Richard vocabularies. You know vocabularies are shrinking today. If you ask the kid, hey, how was that birthday party that you went to? Awesome. Hey, you went and saw that flume general book. How was that? Awesome? Hey, you asked Lipo or how was that awesome? Even Mcdonald's had French fries and above. How was that awesome? One day you will wonder, your fallen in love. One day you'll hold somebody's hand. You will see the sun go down. You will see thousands of shades of orange. You will kiss someone, you will make love to someone. What will you come back and say, awesome.

Speaker 2:          29:22          You use, you use that word for French fries. [inaudible] so you see you. When

Speaker 1:          29:36          vocabulary shrink we have, we have available, we have lesser power to communicate our ideas in a way that touches the heart and we can't communicate. So in order to become better communicators, we need to build your be a storyteller. Abellio vocabulary and Billy are visual. They're all kinds of vocabularies. Verbal is one. But you know, explore what vocabulary you can be strong at and build that because if you can't, then how will you express new ideas in interesting ways, all existing ideas in you obese. But that's what storytellers do. Now when that guy had put up a board, all he was saying was, I'm blind. Please help. He was using two magic words, please and help. But we've seen so much of that that it's not working. So when messaging becomes leverage as words that everybody is familiar with, that messaging becomes blind spot and people see it but people don't see it. It's like cows in India, you'll see them but you don't see them, right. That beggars at the, at, at, at the traffic signals you'll see them, but you don't see them. And it takes a foreigner to come into India and they say, Oh my God, you got cars on the road. Good. Good, good, good, good, good, great. So because they see from a fresh perspective. And do you remember when he asked the lady, what did you do to my sign?

Speaker 1:          31:00          She didn't make the holding bigger. She didn't put four signs. She is not increasing the media spend on the, on the messaging on the same spin, on the same size of poster. She, all she did was changed the messaging. It's woke up. It's how we say it that makes all the difference. So, you know, imagine a world where people have the power of vocabularies. So, uh, this is from the work that you know, uh, organ. We, the agency that I worked with earlier and advertising did for scrabble in India.

Speaker 4:          31:38          Hey, you do cut me off. Well, your name, I was like goofy people, chefs and you while you're late. So I have to know mania. What? Oh, okay. Okay. You take risk losing my words.

Speaker 1:          32:06          There's vocabulary. Better storyteller.

Speaker 3:          32:12          Okay.

Speaker 1:          32:12          That's a powerful framework. It can be used for world changing ideas for big conflicts like the conflict women face in the world today. Smaller conflicts in a humorous tone. It can also be used for technology products. If we were to go back in time and since we are at Google I and say, you know, if let's, let's use the framework to say how do we tell the story of Google search? A good metaphor could be not, you know, imagine a world where people can find the needle. You're looking for your needle, not anybody's else's needle but your needle in a haystack because that's what the world wide web is. And the worldwide web is full of search results. But our algorithm makes it easy for you to find your needle, which is based on relevance, which is based on this which is based on that Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah. It's simple metaphor, right? Complex Algorithm, simple story. Imagine a world where everybody can find their needle in a haystack.

Speaker 1:          33:18          So see how you can use a framework like that to tell the story of the product that you are building that Google is building today. And it's building different kinds of products and solving different kinds of conflicts. Yesterday it was solving the conflict of finding the needle in the haystack. Today it's finding, you know, new or conflicts to solve at, to resolve. Uh, and, and newer stories have to be told about those conflicts. Explore that. Now business storytelling is not just for products. It's not just for, uh, it's, it's to be, it can it still be and can be used in all kinds of contexts, including leadership and leadership is not just about vision and setting the vision. That's a large part of it. But it's also about building a team and working along with team nurturing a team, nurturing talent. So I'm happy to share with you a story of when I realized the power of story when I use it during a performance appraisal.

Speaker 1:          34:14          No, not my performance appraisal. When I was conducting performance appraisal and I was sitting in my cabin and I led a strategic team of about seven people, uh, and it was that time of the year. When you look back at the performance, when you set goals, uh, and you assign a number after that conversation and one by one, each member of my team were coming and we were having that conversation. Now it was time for the best performer in the team to come in. The best performer in the team truly deserve this. A very good race because you know, he had done the equivalent of filing a patent. A lot of people don't file Peytons and converting that into a business where most of the patents are not converted into businesses. He had done the equivalent of both in the advertising towns. Think of it as award winning advertising that critics love, but most award winning advertising doesn't sell products. But this product's were flying off shelves like hotcakes, right? It done the equipment of both one of the best performers, not just in my team, but in the entire office and for that year in the industry as well. And it was time for his performance appraisal and he swaggers into my room. Callers raised, pulls the chair and sinks into it. Hands raised behind his head, looks into my eyes.

Speaker 3:          35:39          Okay.

Speaker 1:          35:39          Oh, Khaki, look. And when I look at him, it reminds me of a story. So I sit him down and sometimes bosses have to practice what is called tough love. And I tell him a story. Now that story is from the year 1989 when two wonderful cricketers made their debut for India. One of them retired recently as the god of cricket. The other one, nobody remembers when he retired. His name is of course what you said. We're not commonly now for those who love cricket and who know, and there are many in India, you would notice that 98919901990 (992) 199-0345 years. Who had the higher batting average. We not commonly match after match in all formats of the game and in all kinds of games. He was calling more than than the record consistently. That's how you get a higher batting average. And if you go back and listen to commentary and export and what they used to say, you know, this guy commonly had a finer batting technique. He had final shots, election and a wider range of shorts. But he had one problem,

Speaker 1:          36:52          attitude. And in life we underestimate hardwork and we overestimate talent, but we underestimate what hard work. And I could, I could see a story unfolding here. They was talent here. Batting average was high, but it came with something else. And I got reminded of that story. So I shared that story with him and I added some more bits stored. And I said, you know what, you know, after many years after this, you know, after 10 years later, there was a guy who grew up watching 10 deluca play and he made his debut for India and his name is William the say well and he went on to do what Endoka always dreamt of but could never do, not once, but twice, which is why he's called Sultan of molten. He scored those tuples centuries, not in India, but in conditions which are difficult, which are tailored for Bolos and tend to always dreamt of that.

Speaker 1:          37:45          But he could never, but you know what? And then, you know, you Raj did something that tend to always wanted to do but could never achieve. Right. Six sixes. But if there was one thing that sets apart then the worker from all the players, it was as hunger for the game. It was his passion for the game and the fact that that many years later when he, he was considered the god of cricket and he had nothing to prove. Even then he would go to the nets half an hour before everybody else. He would put an much more hard work and, and, and, and good stories like this happen when talent meets hard work. I told that story to my friend, to my colleague who was working with me and seven years have passed since then and in seven years there are people who used to report to you, uh, do you have a different relationship after with them?

Speaker 1:          38:37          Seven years later they become your contemporaries. They become friends. I have moved on. I do my own thing. He does his own thing. But I am happy to report to you that he continues to be a 10 car. And there are many reasons for that. First is his own innate talent. Second, you go to be at the right place at the right time, but, but he still credits that conversation as a, as a, as a life changing moment. And he says that, you know, I have now combined a work ethic with my talent and that makes all the difference. So where can we apply stories and where we are in all walks of life. When we say business, you know, business is not just about pitching. It's not just about fundraising. It's not just about telling the story of our product, you know, businesses also nurturing talent.

Speaker 1:          39:21          Business is also building a team. Businesses also setting a vision. And we under leverage stories and storytelling in all walks of life. When we don't use stories like this and we don't use and we don't tell stories, uh, where we can. So when you go out, uh, uh, from here and say, how do I build a bank of my own stories around? That's something that we can, we should all aim for, right? How can I build a bank of my own stories that again, use for various situations for various context. There are three sources really that you can look into, uh, using which you can build your bank of stories. The first one is your own life. Reflect on your own life, on in, on your own journeys. And your life is rich with stories. So if you could give you a couple of cues when you look back at your life, because we must, and we must reflect on our lives.

Speaker 1:          40:11          Leaders are reflective practitioners. They reflect on their lives. They reflect on their journeys, on their strengths and their weaknesses and their draw lessons from there. So reflect on your lives. Ask yourself the question, what is the proudest moment of my life? Go back to that and see what made that happen. And there is something there. Look at that. But also ask yourself the question, what are the biggest failure in your life? And we've all failed at something or the other spectacularly. And what is the lesson we can derive from there? And that's a story. And you would say, hey, why would I share that story with anyone? But look around and leaders don't hesitate to share failure stories. In fact, leaders share failure stories because if you don't share your failure story in a business, if you don't add Google, if you don't learn from our failure stories, those failures will repeat themselves. So I say this, that a failure stories don't go viral. Failures go violent.

Speaker 1:          41:15          It's better that stories go viral and we can all learn from the stories so that failures don't repeat. So you know, your own life is a rich source of story. The second is there are stories in your organization and their stories, you know, in this company that, that, that are there. But we look around and there are enough stories, you know, stories of products that have succeeded like anything, uh, stories of per, of projects that were Abingdon. What can we learn from those stories? They're, they're better stories sometimes too to look, look at and learn from stories of projects, uh, that could not see Dale flight stories of projects that didn't go as planned. They were not Abingdon, they were launched into the market but didn't work. What can we learn from a customer? What can we learn from a project that worked beautifully for Emory approach project?

Speaker 1:          42:05          Actually, we can break into milestones and we must have those meetings after the project is complete. To look at those three or four milestones and say, what are the stories we can learn? And then look at life all around you because life all around you. We are swimming and breathing stories. Like I use a story from sport. It's all around us. All the story from my theology or we can learn from other people's stories. So these are the three sources of stories and reflect on your journey. Reflect on your stories and see which story you can, you can tell and build into your bank of stories. Uh, and I say there's that the best stories come to you when you listen. Great storytellers are not just great orators. They're not just people with great vocabularies. You become a good storyteller when you listen because when you listen you will get your stories.

Speaker 1:          42:51          On that note, I'm happy to share a story with you and many years ago when television was a new idea, there was this guy who used to go from place to place selling TVs and he would go to this, you don't, to up to a place that had not heard of television and he would sell the concept called TV to them. One day he reached a village where you saw a strange sight. He saw that, you know, every evening people gather around a fire in the evening after they come back from work and they share stories with each other. He said, Hey, you guys love listening to stories, right? And you guys love sharing stories. You guys will love this box. It tells you a lot of stories. Everybody loved that idea and every house in that village bought a TV. It was his best sale in months.

Speaker 1:          43:36          So far. He was so happy. He had met his quota for the, for the, for the next three months. He went on holiday and then he went on to other places and a few months passed and he was, he was coming back and he was passing by the same village and he said, I must visit this village. These people were so nice. They bought so many TVs. I met my sales target for three months, so he stopped by to pay them a visit, but he was met with a strange sight. He saw all the TVS lying, stacked one on top of the other gathering dust. He said, let me wait here and figure out what's happening. So He's, he waited in the village in the evening, everybody came back from work and as usual they gathered around the fire and started telling stories to each other and he went at that point of time and said, Hey, what happened?

Speaker 1:          44:25          Remember me? You bought all those TVs where the gathering dust and the village elders spoke and he said, Beta. I know initially these boxes, they were wonderful. They told us a lot of stories from here and they're from places near and far and stories about about off places and things that we had never visited before and it was wonderful. But there's one big problem. It doesn't listen to us stories and a lot of communication has become like that today where people are just full of their stories and they want to tell their stories. But we have no time to listen to other people's stories. But great leaders, great marketers and innovators are able to lead market and innovate because they listen to people's stories. Not just business leaders but also political leader. That's how we solve problems and that's how conflicts are resolved in the world.

Speaker 1:          45:28          Not just by telling stories but by listening to other people's stories. So see what stories you can listen to and how they lead you to your ideas. And then once you build that idea into a product, see how we can go and tell the story of that product. On that note, I'll end with a story and then we'll open up for questions if you have any. A long time ago. There was an old man, this old man had a long white flowing beard and he had a nice, interesting jacket with wonderful designs and lots of pockets and wherever the old man went, people would call out to him, reach out to him and say, hey, hey, hey all mine, why don't you come and spend some time with us? Everybody loved the old man. They said, hey, old man, come and spend some time with us, have some tea and cake with us.

Speaker 1:          46:16          I have some wine and cheese with us. Everybody loved the old guy. At the same time in the world, there was a lady, wherever she went, people shut their doors and windows. Nobody liked the lady. The lady was very upset. She goes to the old man and says, why is it that wherever you go, you are welcome. But I'm turned away. Who are you? The old man, he destructors hold the shoulders. He smiled and said, I am story. Who are you? And she said, I am truck. You see you. Nobody likes the truth. But she said, oh, I'm going to make it easier for people. So she removed her clothes and she hoped that people would now welcome her, but nobody likes the naked truth.

Speaker 1:          47:00          But the old man had the wisdom to know that the world needs the truth. So he, he spoke to her and he said, lady, why don't you come along with me? There's much more hospitality than I need for myself. There's much more a wine and cheese that I need for myself as much more tea and cake that I need for myself. I can share with you, why don't you come along with me? And that's exactly what truth did towards jumped into stories pocket. And from that day, my friends that has said that, wherever story goes, you can find tooth

Speaker 2:          47:32          data.

Speaker 1:          47:39          The day does that. What does that fact rapid in the story and where will that story goes? You'll find that truth. On that note, I close and I hope your story takes you to interesting places. Don't hesitate to share your story. Listen, share and gloved and male story take you to wonderful places. Because like I said, wonderful stories happen to people who tell them, well, this is the point where I say, I'm happy to take questions if you have and happier if you have none. Open House. Yes sir.

Speaker 2:          48:21          Can you just stand?

Speaker 1:          48:24          I have lots of them. Uh, but the uh, you know, uh, and there are many failures, uh, that we've all had. Uh, one of the failures that I had, uh, when I started the farm and I had never been an entrepreneur before and you know, had worked in, you know, as a salaried employee, you'd be know and we have no entrepreneurial born gene, uh, in the family. My parents were teachers. All of my cousins are below, uh, either teachers or doctors or employees. And when I started off, uh, I really didn't know how to build that business and I, that's why I started story wireless. I decided that I'll work from office. So I hired an office space and all I used to do was go to office and set an operate from there. But there was no business was coming in and I realized that this is not how business works.

Speaker 1:          49:24          I was expecting business to come and just because in my mind I thought our business has, and then I have to figure out a lot of things on how to, we still don't do business development in the traditional sense. All our business comes in, uh, and, and knocks at our door. But how to get them to knock at our door is, is a big lesson that I learned. I had no idea how to do that. And there are really two ways of building business. If you look at all methods of building business, you can put them into two buckets. The first bucket is you go and knock on somebody's door. The second bucket is you get people to knock at your door. And I failed at this miserably and I learned that. So first year, if I, if I go and look at the first year of business that we did at story wireless for the first nine months, our billing was zero. And I loaned her the hardware. But now that I learned how to get people to knock at your door and sometimes video is good because you know, if I can reflect on it, if you can develop on it and see what made you fail and learn from it, then it's good. Thanks and wonderful question.

Speaker 5:          50:36          Uh, us what need more precise with our means, which is generally going to try and to get an approval. Most of the times we'll look for stories. Your mind, is there a good friends to clean the principles that are, maybe there's a modification to the principals district over here and you're trying to prove anything.

Speaker 1:          50:58          Yup. I think the principles remain same. The way you apply them, you know, becomes a sharper lens. And, and one, one thing that you would add to this list of principles is what I call a Wifi. The wifi is a simple principle. Doubleu IIF, why Watson it for you? That's a very important principle because you know somebody's going to get, give you an extension, not because there's something in it for you, because there's something at the end of that extension period that's going to come back to me, right? So the VP principle is something that you know, gets added on when we go from these macro to the micro nuances of everyday work. And you add the Wifi principle when you asked for an extension, I'm not asking something for myself. There's something which is coming back to you at the end of this. If you don't give it to me, it may not come back to you.

Speaker 1:          51:42          You know, right now I'm not in a position. And when we walk them through that and get them to see things from our perspective by to the transport, uh, that, that we are supposed to do as storytellers, then they will get that picture. There's a second one which you didn't ask, but you know, we do a lot of work with numbers and data and, and, and when you apply these principles, how do you apply them to numbers and data? Uh, that's, that's perhaps another talk for about 15 minutes or 20 minutes. There are three or four specific principles that help us bring numbers and data to life. There's somebody from Google who's done wonderful work, uh, Google, uh, in other market where we would, where she's written a book as well. She's no longer with Google, uh, but she's written a book on how to tell stories using numbers and data. And that's a good reference point to get started. But the principles are fairly simple.

Speaker 5:          52:38          Okay.

Speaker 1:          52:39          Uh, the name will come back to me in a bit,

Speaker 1:          52:54          speak louder than thousand words. We've all heard that before. Uh, but you know, we, uh, when I speak of pitchers, I don't just mean pictures in the sense that we'll use to, we used to think of them. Of course. They're very powerful. I can tell you a story about how Ratan Tata, uh, when he briefed the team four, nine, oh, which is one of the biggest disruptions that happened in the automotive world, uh, before Google and Tesla came along. Uh, uh, that journey was triggered with a presentation that use one slide and one photo in much line. And that photo was that he saw, he saw a family of four on a scooter. I'm Hamare do. And all he did was he came back, he sketched that on a piece of paper and he's, he's, you know, he says, I'm not great at sketching, but he's gets that.

Speaker 1:          53:39          And He, and he do a roof on top of that scooter. And he gave it to his secretary and he said, can you scan that? And he's this, can that image and put that into the presentation. The Nana wasn't called an I know Nana wasn't born. It wasn't even conceived of. He put that photograph on the slide and call the top management deck CFO, head of manufacturing, head of marketing, a head of design. And with that one slide he explained the target audience for whom they were building a product. He explained the conflict. You know, these are people who are exposed to elements, people who are exposed to rains, people who are exposed to beggars at a, and all kinds of things at uh, traffic lights. Right? So he explained the conflict, but through that slide he also said, what is the, what are the target audience?

Speaker 1:          54:24          And when you say the target audience, he also explained to that side, what is the price constraint? We are not making a car four car upgraders we are making a car for four upgraders who are going to buy a car for the first time scooter upgraders two car. And that has a price target. And that price target too that he explained the materials problem because they were not to do, to achieve that. You know, they will have to be some innovation in terms of materials and metallurgy and how you fuse glass with metal and all of that. Uh, so he spoke to the head of design, head of manufacturing, head of finance, head of marketing, all of that to one slide. Now that's a powerful example, but, but I don't mean visuals only in that sense. That's one part of your visual vocabulary. The second part of visual vocabulary is data visualization. How do you bring your data alive for any two sets of data on x and y axes? Today there are 20 visualizations that are possible. You can bring it alive and graph a versus graph B. Typically, we don't explore those 20 visualization to say which one is the best to communicate the Wifi,

Speaker 1:          55:27          which one is the simplest. We don't put up four slides for four different charts and say which one communicates. There's the boost. We don't do that. Typically we just go ahead with what comes to us intuitively. And, and, and, and developing that vocabulary takes some time. But you know, he just a function of doing something again and again and you get better at it. So that's, that's on visual vocabulary. Uh, and there was another question from there. That's the last question we'll take and then we'll stop. Uh, yes.

Speaker 1:          56:05          Well, uh, my mother, uh, you know, when I was growing up, we had a lot of stories, uh, about partition. Uh, we had a lot of stories. I was brought up by a single parent, uh, about loss, uh, off things and family. Uh, I heard a lot of stories. She was a teacher, so I had a lot of stories about, about how we should look at life. Uh, and she was a teacher in the purest sense. No tuitions, uh, uh, she believes, yeah. Then the, that the best education is that you can give during the class, not afterwards. And if you're not doing that, then you're not doing a good job as a teacher. So, you know, all, all the good things that we learn from teachers. I know she was my, she was my first teacher. The mothers are typically your first teachers at home.

Speaker 1:          56:56          I have a lot of stories from her. Uh, in terms of business storytelling. Uh, there's this wonderful guy I worked with for 10 years. Uh, his name is Santos Dsi. Uh, he's written a wonderful book. He writes a column in the Times of India, every Monday, a Citi, Citi Bank bank. That's the guy. Uh, I think he's a fantastic storyteller. I've had a wonderful working relationship with them. And then it's really rare that you work with somebody for 10 years. I have learned a lot by seeing him at work. [inaudible] is a wonderful storyteller and tell you why, to me great stories or truth well told. And when I say truth, well told you have to live that truth. Embody that truth in your life. When he told us people fly economy,

Speaker 3:          57:39          yeah,

Speaker 1:          57:40          that's not messaging. You have to live that truth yourself. You have to fly con me. That story has to be evident in your life, right? So he lived his story and he lived life by the story that he told. When you can live your life by the stories that you tell, you're a fantastic storyteller.

Speaker 3:          58:01          Thank you for having me.

Speaker 1:          58:07          Eventually, you know, time runs out for everything, including life. Uh, but that doesn't mean that, you know, questions have to end here. That's my email id. I'd love to hear from you if you have more questions. Uh, uh, send them in. I'm, I usually respond to mail within 48 hours. Have a nice evening ahead.

Speaker 3:          58:28          Yeah.
