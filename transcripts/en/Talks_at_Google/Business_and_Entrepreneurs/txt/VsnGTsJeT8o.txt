Speaker 1:          00:06          Thank you. Uh, my name is again, Josh, his tail and I run accessible to pan and it's a website day, dies, shares the accessibility features of uh, living in Japan with people who are interested in visiting a, they'd have a disability. I didn't grow up in a height Roppongi hills, but a instead of when I looked out my window, this is what I saw. And um, this is the view from my bedroom. I live in a small, small town outside of Oxbridge and it was as her ex as I've Toronto called experts. And, uh, it was me, my sisters, my parents, and about 20 sheep. Um, so that's why I like spending most of my time looking at now I have what's called cerebral palsy. And a, it's a very fancy way of saying that I have brain damage. Uh, there's two types of, uh, ways to describe brain damage.

Speaker 1:          00:52          And uh, after your brain is filling this developing and you may have an accident or something like that, then that'd be regular type of brain damage through palsy happens when your brain is still developing. So when you're very young and because of that, uh, as you develop, your body will develop differently. Um, and it can have a wide variety. Um, for example, some people can just have a little bit of a trouble moving their arms around and other people can be completely after the stay in bed all the time. I'm, I'm somewhat in the middle, I'm classified as severe. Um, but for me, the way it affects me is my arms and my legs. So they're physically healthy, but the signals from our brain don't properly get conveyed to move the muscles the way I want. And because it happened when I was young, when I developed a, for example, my hands, um, the muscles of the bottom were always tight.

Speaker 1:          01:38          And so as I grew bigger, because it was tight, my hands started to bend down. So when you look at pictures, when I was a kid, my hands were much more street. And so that's where one of the main differences between regular brain damage and cerebral palsy. So would that mean for my daily life? Well, I have to have somebody who it's called a helper and maybe an English would be more commonly called a personal care assistant. So today I'm here with the highest son, so I'm very thankful for his assistance every day of my life. Um, so what happens is I, uh, people with disabilities, you can get evaluated by the city they're living in and they get a certain number of hours that they can use in their daily life. Um, and then you get a contract with different companies in your local area and make schedules for your daily routine.

Speaker 1:          02:26          So my helpers help me from the first thing in the morning. So the first person I see in the morning, last person I see at night is my helper and a not so romantic, but um, so, um, but uh, yeah, so they helped me get up in the morning and to have a shower, get dressed, et cetera. I get ready for work. And then after work they help me maybe with some shopping or with, um, uh, cooking or cleaning around the house. And then the nights they helped me get into bed. And do it all again the next day for when I go out. Um, my day life requires a lot of planning. Uh, planning ahead. Um, not something can just jump on a train and go meet somebody somewhere. Um, I need to think of, for example, if I have that night, I have a helper scheduled, I have to be back before the helper comes.

Speaker 1:          03:06          Uh, we're also have to pay the cancellation fee or it may not be able to get into bed. Um, when I think about transportation, I always have to leave extra time and he, uh, transfer usually probably takes about 20 minutes longer than it says on the Google maps. So, um, I'd say those things into account when I'm going out with friends as well. I need to think about restaurants. Um, it can be a very big challenge to find a place to eat. It's a very simple task for most people, but for me, because of my electric wheelchair, it's very difficult to get into many restaurants, uh, particularly in Japan where there tend to be very small. Um, and there's a, I love Japan, but I don't like, again, con because it's a, it's a step that you know, keeps me out. So it can be discouraging at times. I'm trying to go, maybe you want to eat ramen and, um, so you're out with friends. You want to go get Ramen, you find a lot of delicious looking places, but you can't get into any of them. Uh, and then you end up having to go to a family restaurant or something like that. And then, so planning ahead is very important so you can figure out what is available for you.

Speaker 1:          04:09          So with all those extra requirements, why would I come to Japan? Um, and what was talked about earlier. Um, I took a class in Japanese in high school and my Japanese teacher, he really loves Japan and that was infectious. And so I thought, oh, I wanted to try going. And, uh, my parents, they always encouraged me to follow my dreams. They always said that even though you have a disability, um, you can do what other people can do to a certain degree or as the same as them. Um, it may just take a bit more time or do things a little bit differently, but you should always follow your dreams. Now they say they regret that because I moved to Japan now and never go home. Um, but, but when the first time I came there was really little to no information on accessibility in Japan.

Speaker 1:          04:51          Um, now Google was around at that point and, but if there's nothing to find, then your search results are zero. Um, so, uh, through lot of phone calls and very, very vague, um, books and stuff or decide to take the risk. And I came to Japan with my dad for a couple of weeks back in the year 2000. And, um, I was really surprised to find how to spell Japan was a, it was different than my expectations, I think. And, um, I realized that hey, this is a place I could live. And so after finishing university I decided that I wanted to come and move to Japan. When I did that, there was a real requirement for a lot of logistics. As I said, I need helpers in Canada. The government provides the helpers in Japan as well. The government provides a helpers, but in the interim, um, I need to bring somebody with me to take care of me until I could get into the system.

Speaker 1:          05:39          So I had to come with someone for about six months until I was able to fully in. And, um, as well as finding a place to live, it can be very difficult to find an apartment. It's accessible to wheelchair users. Um, so yeah, again, a lot of planning and to overcoming logistics. Uh, but I got here and I've been here for 10 years now and as mentioned, I became a Japanese citizen last year and a, so I'm actually no longer Canadian citizen because I had to give up my citizenship. But, um, but here I am to stay for good. Whether you like it or not.

Speaker 1:          06:10          Uh, the company I work at right now is called as elite group and one of their court, um, principals is giving back to the, uh, going back to the society and your local community. And uh, I feel the same way. And, um, so I wanted to use the experiences I had as a person with a disability does come from another country and, uh, probably very few people like that in Japan at the moment. So I thought I should, uh, use what I have to give back. Um, so that brought me to the, the need that a lot of people face. I think that, well it's true with those stairs here. Um, of course it started personal when I just wanted to go out with friends or if I wanted to go on vacation in Japan, uh, just the, the challenge of finding the right information, uh, because you don't want to go on a vacation and then find out that you can't get into your hotel because I'd be very traumatic.

Speaker 1:          06:57          Um, so in doing a lot of research, um, I thought I was able to read Japanese now, so I was looking at things in Japanese. I realize there's still, it wasn't much information in English, uh, for people with disabilities. And, um, just as an example here, you're of course going to go to a tourist sites when you're coming here. And, uh, if you look at this website, um, you look at the information that's available in English and as very basic things like the regular hours days close, which is a very useful information for, I'm just your average visitor. Uh, but you know, you don't know anything about it if you're in a wheelchair, uh, what's available. You know, if you go all the way out there are going to be able to actually enjoy the place. But if you look on the Japanese site, uh, they have a lot of information to, for example, it came, how far can you go up the castle or their wheelchairs available friends or their wheelchair toilets available, where are they?

Speaker 1:          07:47          Um, so all that information is there, but it's available only in Japanese. Um, so for most people, they're not going to necessarily go and look and translate the webpage, a website, uh, because if you're not in English, then there's nothing there. So, so there's a real difference between the English and Japanese versions of places as well for your hotels, this website and they have a, the universal twin, um, that sort of another side side notice that the phrasing in Japan and in North America or Europe or wherever it is quite different. So Universal Twain, if you said that at some data, I have no idea what you're talking about. Um, or a barrier freak NOI, you would know what that means in, in mostly English speaking countries. Most people search for accessible. So even if it was written in as barrier free, that's not likely going to click for somebody who doesn't know the terminology.

Speaker 1:          08:38          And then again on the same site, if you look at the English page of the rooms didn't nonetheless the universal twin being available. Now, there's probably a practical reason to this and that, um, they need, they can't use the booking system to book accessible rooms for the most part because they want to ensure that, uh, it's people who are actually have disabilities that are using it. So generally you need to have some sort of communication with the hotel to book your room. Um, and so maybe the hotel made a decision that, um, we don't have enough English staff to be able to handle those requests. Um, or they might have come to the idea that, oh no, we are just going to be coming visiting anyways. So there's no point in translating this webpage as well. So as realizing that there's a lot of challenges that people who want to come just for vacation, um, have, so that led me to the journey of a starting to accessible to Penn.

Speaker 1:          09:27          I, I like this picture. My mom took it. I didn't know [inaudible] I wish she had a better phone log. So better pictures. So my mission statement for, um, accessible Japan is to provide as much information as possible on accessibility in Japan. So travelers with disabilities can make informed decisions based on their needs so they can enjoy Japan to its fullest. So the end result is I want people to enjoy Japan. I love Japan. That's why I've moved here and that's where I want to stay here forever. Um, and I want people to enjoy the, his van as well, but a lot of people dispersed when they're looking for places to go. If there's not the information there, they don't want necessarily spend all the money to come over here if they don't know what they're going to come into. Um, so I tried to get as much information as possible and uh, there are so many different types of disabilities.

Speaker 1:          10:14          I can't say displace successful. This place is not acceptable because that's not something I can decide for everybody. Um, so what I do is I tried to provide as much information as possible and then they can make decisions based on their own needs and uh, whether they go to those places are not so accessible. Japan has been constantly pivoting and updating, evolving. Um, I like to take credit for all of the ideas, but, um, a lot of them come from interacting with people who have contacted me. Um, for example, I have a page on, um, bringing your guide dog to Japan. That's not something I've ever considered a, but somebody asked me a question, well, what's the system like for bringing guy, Doctor Japan? And because of that idea that that were part of the webpage was born. Um, so it's constantly been changing. At first it was just basic information on how to get around me, be on a train or um, what it's like to try to find a hotel or just sort of very general ideas and as well as a blog.

Speaker 1:          11:12          And they use the blog to introduce different parts of Japan to people, for example, um, how to find a restaurant if you have a wheelchair or, um, even parts of Japanese culture. So there's the anime there, a silent voice in the character from that, uh, story. She has a, she's deaf, so she has trouble communicating. And so that's sort of part of the story and in general about human communication. So somebody wrote a review for that side, put that on there as well. So, and then of course, I have a youtube channel as well. Uh, I use youtube different than a lot of people use and that I look at people's reviews of places and don't really listen to what they're saying by constantly looking at the ground, see if their steps or if there's any barriers. Um, so because of that I realized, Oh, I thought I should, I probably should have some videos as well because it speaks much more than a few pictures or my comments. So I try to provide as much information, the videos as well.

Speaker 1:          12:10          And again, going back to the hotel, so I created a searchable database of hotels with accessible rooms. If you go to places like rock 10 or other travel sites, you have a little checkbox in the extra information where you can check off is accessible or not. Uh, but usually that just says that there is an accessible room you still up to you to go and research everything. So I tried to correlate all the information I could get and put it into the database. So I got that either through the, where the variation is available on the websites or contacting the hotels with surveys and asking. And as well as getting people to put their own reviews on. Um, and a lot of those things include, uh, toilets. This will come up a couple of times. So I hope you use the toilets, um, is something everybody needs to do.

Speaker 1:          12:55          And um, it's something that's very important if you're going to be spending the mind to state place. And I'm in places like Europe or in North America, there are very strict rules about when an accessible room is like they have, um, maybe what angles, uh, the walls are at, how you can approach the toilet, how much space is between the beds, et cetera. And it's all very well dictated. So you can in general with insurance, rent a room and a, you know, you're going to be okay. We're in Japan is, tends to be more general guidelines of what's accessible. So you can find two places to hotels with a quote unquote accessible rooms and one will have maybe some handlebars next to the toilet. And that's it. That's the only difference from a regular room. And other places, we'll have these huge sprawling rooms with the toilet that's covered in white tiles and looks like a hospital with all these equipment that you've never seen before.

Speaker 1:          13:43          Um, so it can be quite a variety. So I tried to show that I'm on the reviews of the hotels as well. Uh, bathrooms, of course the showers are difficult at times because people can necessarily get into the bathtub. A lot of the places in North America will have a roll in shower so you can drive your wheelchair right into the shower area. Uh, but a lot of places in Japan, very, very few have those. Um, so I had a little life hack is that you can, you can see on the ground there, there's actually a drain on the floor. Um, so as long as you don't tell the staff, you can put the chair next to the bathroom in the bathtub and shower there as well as just information on what the rooms look like. So, not all of them have that kind of integration, but as much as I can get as well, of course people want to see things when they come to Japan.

Speaker 1:          14:28          So I write reviews of attractions. Um, because I live in Tokyo, most of the interactions tend to be in Tokyo area by of some others as well. So they have general information, like a irregular Japan Guide, whoever would have some background information, how to get there with the hours are et Cetera, um, by going to other details as well. Uh, for example, if they say they have an elevator, um, I tried to try it out and see what it's like. So you're on the website, it says there's an elevator, but I wouldn't be able to use this one by myself cause there's not enough room to turn around or push the buttons. But again, it's just that doesn't mean that you can't go there. It's just you should know that in advance. Uh, as well as maybe for the gardens, the routes that are available for accessible travel. Um, some have like this is a Dq van, I think. And it has, um, equate sense of coverage of the grounds. Uh, but some places they only happened maybe about a quarter of the places actually accessible. So you, if you're gonna be going there, you might not to want to intentionally go into that area and just the little things that may occur along your path, uh, such as these steps.

Speaker 1:          15:34          And of course toilets if there's only one more minute of quiet. So bear with me. Um, so yeah, when you're going out, you didn't say essential things mean most people don't think about. But if you're going to be traveling around and you need to use the toilet in the pinch, you want it to know that something's available. So this helps people go and just sort of rest assured that, you know, there is something there and I don't need to worry about it too much. Uh, the next thing is I did a, um, general glossary and a phrase book for Japanese to English. Um, and again, that was started because someone asked me some questions, how do you say this or this? So I translated that, that I'll wash it by page on that. And actually lonely planet contacted me and they're going to use this as the basis for their, um, accessible travel guides.

Speaker 2:          16:17          Okay.

Speaker 1:          16:17          And tourists. I, I'm not a person who likes tour. It's normally like to go on my own path but never go. We're interested in tours. And so I was able to work with a couple of different companies to, uh, consult on accessible tours in Japan. This company is called the inside Japan tours and they serve, offer a complete package, but there's a couple of other ones I would work with that have a, does day tours. And um, and so yeah, they, it gives them a chance to experience what it's like to go around and give it to her. So we went to a couple of different, uh, tourist locations in Tokyo. We rode the train together because it's one thing just to sort of read something in the website. This is how it works as opposed to actually experience it. And within a couple of months of actually having this tour, they had their first disabled as guests. And so they're able to give that present to around Japan because of the consulting.

Speaker 1:          17:06          And I'm, I'm writing an accessible Japan and we your number one, but this is number two here on the screen. A lot of people actually request a wheelchairs or other mental medical equipment in it pinches, uh, for most people they take their wheelchair with them. But there's been times where I've been contacted by somebody, maybe they broke their leg two weeks before their vacation. I need to rent a wheelchair, you know, or um, I'm going with my grandmother and she can't walk very far. And do you know what plays, I can rent the wheels wheelchair, I don't want to buy one just for coming in Japan. So, uh, I attend, tend to work with a rental companies for providing most of those. I subcontracted them. Um, but yeah, for in a pinch, this one can fold it up and it's a bag and I can send it by you been to anywhere in the country within a day or so.

Speaker 1:          17:52          And then of course, people want to take something with them sometimes, um, to carry all the information. And it's even if they have a phone with them, they don't want to use the data or something to search on the website. So I made the accessible Japan travel guide for Tokyo and uh, you, it's available right now if you want to buy it on that truths and look at that. It's got five stars. And recently I started the uh, a forum for the website. A lot of the interactions with guests or with a different people have been, um, very important questions that, you know, if you're just doing email, it's sort of one on one and only people that are involved that email can see the information. But a lot of the questions I think could be very helpful to other people as well. Uh, so in a forum kind of base then it's searchable.

Speaker 1:          18:38          People can find it. Um, when they're looking for things as well. If there's something I want to put some information on that doesn't necessarily require a four page, just having a little bit of a way to add quick information has been a very big help. And A, I've been growing steadily compared to last year. I pretty much, it's pretty much doubled in access, um, just in the last year. So that is very exciting, except the more exciting thing is the communication with people who are using the website. And, uh, recently I was contacted by someone who said, your site has really encouraged me to take my daughter to Japan. She has cerebral palsy and cannot walk very long distances, so she needs a wheelchair to usually get around. We were planning a trip for next year. And so when I talked with this person, uh, his daughter loves anime, so her dream is to go to Ikea, Alberta and a knock on Broadway. And so use asking about Nahko Broadway and actually I'm not an enemy and so I'd never heard of it. And so, but I took the opportunity to add that to the website, so I went and did a review of it. Um, but that was a real encouragement to me that because that's the whole purpose of this website is to encourage people to come to Japan and enjoy it. And to have someone actually say that, you know, because of this, I had the courage to bring my daughter here. So,

Speaker 2:          19:56          okay,

Speaker 1:          19:57          so accessible. Japan and Google have a very strong relationship. I think the first thing is that our shared goals and Google's of course, is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. And I think that's very common goal that we have as well. Um, I'm sort of maybe a microcosm of that and that, uh, I'm using a very niche information, uh, that not a lot of people use bites. So put it in one place and make it accessible and useful to people.

Speaker 2:          20:25          Let's see.

Speaker 1:          20:27          Uh, in my day to day use, of course, Google search is probably the, the biggest thing. I use a in a two way kind of communications. So people find, um, bunch of bands or Google search, uh, because of the nature of the website being a preparation for traveling somewhere, it tends that people only use it until they go Japan and then after that they don't really return. So the majority of my visitors are new visitors. So through Google search they're able to find the website. And then for myself, because I can't go to every place that, um, I need to go to or just to answer random questions that come up, I'm, I'm constantly googling things. So I'm very, very, very grateful for for your work. And you can definitely put me at the top of the rankings if you went intent. Um, Google analytics and something else I use quite frequently.

Speaker 1:          21:14          Um, and I'm actually slightly addicted to it. Uh, have it on my phone. I'm constantly checking how many visitors I get to, how many visitors to get to. Um, and it, but more importantly, it helps me to focus, um, through looking at the statistics. I can see, okay, well this area of the website isn't very popular. People aren't using it very much, but this area is gay. A lot of hits. So people have definitely interested in this area. So I should put my, because I have limited amount of time and um, they need to, I can focus on this so I can put my effort into places where people can benefit the most. Google maps of courses, uh, essential for the, uh, hotel searches as well as for me for looking up information and uh, routes for people. And of course, uh, servers aren't free. So, um, Google adsense helps offset some of the costs for running the website. So I'm very thankful for that. And then sort of in closing and started to have some general disability in Google, um, working together and the essentials of that.

Speaker 1:          22:15          So I think it's important to have a wide variety of input on products. Um, so it's either customers or people who are working for the company, they can input to those things and you can find some unexpected things you've heard probably many times about somebody invented some product they thought was going to go off and sell really well, but it doesn't. But then they had some unexpected use cases for it. And that ended up turning into be some huge different world changing ivs. So I encourage you to look for unexpected use cases and a lot of people with disabilities have them. For example, a street view, most people maybe would use it for when they're driving to look for, okay, I'll get you to turn here. This is the landmark I'm looking for or probably the most, most people look at use Google and like, hey look, there's my house and get excited when they see their car parked in front of something or their dog or something.

Speaker 1:          23:04          Um, for me, I use it all the time to do quick accessibility spot checks. So I can, if someone asked me a quick question, I can go in, look at it and street view and I can give a rough idea of, you know, what kind of barriers they might face. If there's steps or something like that. I use it on my own life as well. And I'm looking for maybe like a restaurant or something. If there's no information available on the website, I can uh, go to the street view and I can see, oh, oh, that's in the basement. I can't get in there. Or, oh, it's on the first floor, I can get it, no problem. And not need to worry about anymore a remote desktop. As I mentioned before, I, um, I have my helpers help me and when I get into bed, I'm not necessarily ready to sleep yet and I still have some things I wanted to do, but because of the schedules is from, um, I can use Google chrome remote desktop from my phone to keep working on my computer.

Speaker 1:          23:51          So that's a unexpected thing. I think probably for most people. And I think a big thing coming up is Google home and, uh, the smart speaker and a Iot devices in general, I think it's going to be a very big game changer for people with disabilities. Uh, most of the commercials except or about, you know, families getting up in the morning and saying, you know, hey, turn on the TV. And everybody that gets excited about that. But I think more important is that, you know, somebody who can't move and can't use their arms and legs very well can use that and they can live a more fulfilling life without, uh, as much need for other people to help them out. Um, I've dropped the remote control on my TV at times when there's been no help around it. I can't pick it up. And, uh, thanks to my Chromecast, I can watch something else on TV without having to worry about that.

Speaker 1:          24:35          So look for those unexpected use cases. And since I have your undivided attention, um, everybody, a dream list with me for, um, for some Google products and mostly maps, I think because it has the biggest impact for a lot of people's lives or at least for mine anyways, uh, accessible exits. Uh, right now I think I'm uh, maps, it will show you where the exits are for train stations and subways, but not necessarily which one has the elevator edit. Um, and I spent numerous, um, I mean it's of my day trying to find which place has a, an actual exit and that doesn't come up sometimes. And if it had that could really make things a lot easier and smooth for transfers or just going out and about, um, as well as a toilet. So this is the last time I promise. Um, there was an app that I used to use called a check a toilet.

Speaker 1:          25:27          It's a Japanese sort of crowdsourced a application. And so people would use the maps API and they'd, they'd put pens down for where they're accessible toilets and um, they could share pictures and um, information on them. But because nobody's really been updating it, it's sort of, it's been depreciated so you can't actually use it anymore. Um, so it can be included into Google maps somehow there where the nearest toilet, sorry. Cause that it could help a lot of people. I think there's lost Twitter thing, I promise. Um, and accessible route option as well. Uh, right now you can choose things like, um, minimize transfers or minimize walking distance if there is an option for accessible route a number of times. If he choose the walking path and you come to a busy street, it'll go over the bridge to cross the street. And that's the path that you're usually shown, but of course that doesn't work for me.

Speaker 1:          26:19          So sometimes they're following the map, but all of a sudden, oh, there's a bunch of steps I can't get over the other side. So having some sort of accessible route would be fantastic. Accessible hotel rooms, whether they have them or not. Um, when you lit search and maps, you know, you choose a hotel and on the left hand side it will show you a, for example, what the price ranges or the website, the phone number, et cetera. And, uh, lately I thank you very much for adding accessible stations on for the train stations knows that if you have the same thing for accessible hotels. So I've had just an extra line that said, accessible room available. Yes or no. That could definitely help a lot of people searching for hotels and indoor mapping of course. And I'm sure it's something Google's working on and could help for finding your way around finding elevators instead the stairs.

Speaker 1:          27:07          Cause a lot of times elevators are buried way deep into different areas and maybe possibly a bug bounties for, uh, accessibility. Um, if, I'm not sure if you know, but in Japan there are a lot of places called workshops. So for people with different disabilities that can't get regular jobs, maybe they work in these special workshops where they'll maybe sort of bottle caps or they'll put chopsticks into the holders, etc. And it sort of a way to have people with intellectual disabilities have a job. If they could maybe maybe work team up with Google, it can be a good CSR opportunity to maybe go and check the information that's been added to the local guides, but whether it places accessible or not, and it's finally, it's rumored that accessibility benefits many, uh, everybody maybe thinks that, oh, well it's for a certain group of people, but, uh, you know, if we all live along and if everybody's going to become disabled in some way, whether it's your eyesight gets bore or your knees go out and you can't walk as far.

Speaker 1:          28:08          And, um, I think it's to be thought of, not as special money used on this group, but as opposed to, um, investment in your future. And that's why accessibility is very important. Today. I was on the way and I transferred at Morty Sta and in front of me in the elevator, there's an elderly couple and there's a couple of mothers with baby strollers, and there's people with injuries. And those people are all using things that were quote unquote designed for people with disabilities. So it's important to remember that accessibility is for everyone. It's also for the person delivering Pacu Been, uh, they also appreciate the slopes and the elevators. And then finally, a real dream request is, I know that you guys are trying to get as much information on mapping, so if you need another Google car, let me know. You can stop it on the back part and I will gladly Gore ever. You want me to? All right. Thank you very much.
