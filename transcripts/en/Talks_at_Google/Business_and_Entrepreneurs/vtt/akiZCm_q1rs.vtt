1
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.090
Uh,
so Kenrick,
uh,
you have an amazing life.

2
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.920
You started setting caviar in high end places in Las Vegas and now you propose

3
00:00:14.921 --> 00:00:16.150
shares have ample food,

4
00:00:16.151 --> 00:00:20.050
which is an organic brand of food that is widely democratized and distributed

5
00:00:20.051 --> 00:00:22.610
through micro investments,
uh,

6
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.130
on a very sustainable platform leveraging blockchain.
Uh,
and you're a,

7
00:00:27.131 --> 00:00:31.420
you have a legal background.
You,
you are a former fellow at Stanford law,

8
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.080
um,
and you could on your spare time,

9
00:00:35.081 --> 00:00:37.060
but you don't want to say it in front of everyone at Google,
right?

10
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.020
So that's basically a few things and say I'm done technical particularly in this

11
00:00:41.021 --> 00:00:44.300
room.
So,
um,

12
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.150
the first thing I want to ask you,

13
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.800
because we just use a lot of buzz words there in a very few sentences,

14
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.970
uh,
is the story of Fort Dogs.
So there's a dog from angel list,

15
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.970
a dog from a,
you know,
the tech,

16
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.870
a dog from Wall Street and a street dog,
right?
And all or an old dog.

17
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.020
And the dog from Angelina says,
you know,
when I want more money,

18
00:01:05.021 --> 00:01:06.360
what I do is that I,

19
00:01:06.361 --> 00:01:10.870
I leveraged tokens from a blockchain to do micro investment in startups.
Uh,

20
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.600
uh,
and the dog from Texas.
Wait,
wait,
wait,
wait,

21
00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.620
what's a micro investment in a startup and the dog from Wall Street Days?

22
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.290
Hold on.
What's,
what's blockchain?
Right.

23
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.960
And the dog from the street is what's money?

24
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.000
Cause he hasn't come up with a lot of money his day.
So this is a,
you know,

25
00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:29.710
I don't want it to be a dog eat dog situation.

26
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.760
I wanted to understand every dog's perspective in this.

27
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.700
So how can you make it clear to,
you know,

28
00:01:36.701 --> 00:01:40.900
to every perspective that we can have on this what you're doing exactly in what

29
00:01:40.901 --> 00:01:43.720
your company because you're entrepreneur or founder of republic,

30
00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.480
which is a part of AngelList,

31
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.480
what your company does and that every dog would understand.

32
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.670
<v 0>I lived at hypothetical and I think when it comes to investing is definitely in</v>

33
00:01:54.671 --> 00:01:59.020
a dog eat dog and it's more like jog Fetac we're in this one sense.

34
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.790
I think the easiest way to look at money is that it's a form of energy in a

35
00:02:03.791 --> 00:02:07.450
medium of exchange.
Today we use,
you know,
dollar here,

36
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.730
the pound in England,

37
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.790
but anything can actually be a medium of exchange.

38
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.060
So you need money to drive that energy and grow an idea into a business

39
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.390
conditions necessary.

40
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.080
The question is how do you get more people to do that and how do you break this

41
00:02:29.351 --> 00:02:31.720
energy down into smaller pieces?

42
00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.870
And if you can do that through blockchain technology,

43
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.940
then you have that much more energy directed into this ecosystem and net net

44
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.880
more ideas will grow into more businesses.

45
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.010
So the way I look at investing is that if you manage to make,

46
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.070
and to encourage everyone to invest even a tiny amount of money into this whole

47
00:02:54.551 --> 00:02:59.551
ecosystem and they wrecked that Mooney to where they believe the should be in

48
00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:03.940
terms of entrepreneurship and companies and products,

49
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.190
then which is going to have that much more prosperous of an ecosystem overall.

50
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.130
<v 1>Okay.
So the macro investment part I get from this,
how about the blockchain part?</v>

51
00:03:14.131 --> 00:03:16.950
Like why would you use blockchain for this?

52
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.760
<v 0>The uh,</v>

53
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.600
currently the reason why we take it would cost probably about 20,

54
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.350
$50,000 minimum if you want to invest into real estate even read is that the

55
00:03:34.251 --> 00:03:38.150
cost of transferring,
of,
uh,

56
00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.620
making it possible for people to buy a lot of,
uh,
you know,

57
00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:45.620
a stake in a building a home would be so high.

58
00:03:45.621 --> 00:03:50.480
The cross processing of validating,
of confirming your interests and when,

59
00:03:50.481 --> 00:03:54.200
when you want to sell that interest is going to be equally burdensome.

60
00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.450
Blockchain technology,
one use case of it is fractionalization and automation.

61
00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.710
If you can break the Mona Lisa down into a billion pieces,

62
00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.110
you can have a billion people around the world owning a piece of the Mona Lisa.

63
00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.620
Yes,
it's only worth probably a fraction of a dollar,

64
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.270
but you owning a piece of the Mona Lisa and there's only able recently to

65
00:04:17.271 --> 00:04:22.240
blockchain technology that you can fractionalize things to that degree and that

66
00:04:22.241 --> 00:04:27.241
it costs next to nothing to transfer a tiny fraction of an assets between two

67
00:04:28.161 --> 00:04:28.994
individuals.

68
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.200
<v 1>Hmm.
I have a feeling down or the revenue,
she would have loved your idea.
Right?</v>

69
00:04:32.201 --> 00:04:35.860
So,
um,
and be very interested in the mechanism.

70
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.850
So when I get from this is that this micro investment,

71
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.350
which is a form of expression of crowdfunding,
but more organized,
right?

72
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.710
More a on a platform,

73
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.760
you're standing somewhere between crowdfunding and an IPO,
right?
Uh,

74
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.350
there is this middle space that has not really been invested,

75
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.300
if I might use the word before in which,
uh,
initiatives need money.

76
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.900
And why wouldn't you come at this earlier than the formal IPO,

77
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.580
which return investment might not be so,

78
00:05:03.581 --> 00:05:06.520
so high because now there's the technology.

79
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.340
And if I notice where also the regulation for this,

80
00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.920
<v 0>uh,
early investing naturally comes with high risk and much higher return.</v>

81
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.740
So I think most people,
uh,

82
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.640
nowadays this ecosystem know that Uber is about to file for IPO.

83
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.120
People who buying in post IPO,

84
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.720
pretty much anyone who's not a millionaire will see a return or a depreciation.

85
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.930
But you know,
two x three x or 20% loss.

86
00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:40.380
Obviously if you invested $10 in or $100 into Uber is very first round on angel

87
00:05:42.131 --> 00:05:43.250
list today,

88
00:05:43.251 --> 00:05:48.251
that's going to be worth somewhere between 1.5 to $2 million on face value.

89
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.980
So getting in early is definitely a value proposition,

90
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.350
but it wasn't legal.
And two,
2016,

91
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.230
up until two and a half years ago,

92
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.550
you got to be a millionaire to invest in private companies.

93
00:06:04.551 --> 00:06:07.390
And I'm glad that it was very different now.
All right.

94
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.060
And so that's when your legal background comes into play because you knew the

95
00:06:11.061 --> 00:06:15.560
Lao address changed and they do a huge new opportunity for people to invest

96
00:06:15.561 --> 00:06:20.120
because they don't need to have to be certified in investors if I get this
right.

97
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.650
And so then the question is how do we organize this to work efficiently for

98
00:06:24.651 --> 00:06:26.930
everyone,
right?
Am I right in this?
Absolutely.

99
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.560
So obviously the law is there to make sure that people are,

100
00:06:30.561 --> 00:06:35.360
now they're defrauding,
you know,
grandmas and people with very little,
um,

101
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.450
dispensable income.
Now,
on the other hand,

102
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.310
99% of the world of the United States wealthiest country in the world,

103
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.480
99% of people have never made a private investment.

104
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.220
So they don't know what it is.

105
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:54.200
Everyone had taken a cap or a taxi almost everyone before Uber.

106
00:06:54.201 --> 00:06:57.320
So when they made it possible,
it was just a natural leap.

107
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.760
What we're trying to do is to get everyone to do something that they have never

108
00:07:01.761 --> 00:07:02.960
been done before.

109
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:07.610
So it's a much more challenging journey from the branding,

110
00:07:07.611 --> 00:07:10.850
marketing exposure,
as well as legal and business.
All right.

111
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.150
So I want your platform as part of the preparation for this talk.

112
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:17.210
I discovered the breadth of products that you have there.

113
00:07:17.211 --> 00:07:21.320
It's amazing you go from ample food,
which I mentioned,
uh,

114
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:23.810
to uh,
some more tech startups.

115
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.380
Can you tell us how do you curate the propositions?

116
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:30.230
Because I still want to know that my daughters are invested in place that is

117
00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:34.700
kind of safer curated,
and I think you'll provide that service a given an angel,

118
00:07:34.701 --> 00:07:39.701
this is our institutional cofounder and our team has a heritage back to the

119
00:07:40.461 --> 00:07:44.090
eventual DVC Lens.
So we do apply some natural lens.

120
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:48.350
Is their credibility.
Uh,
founders have domain expertise.

121
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:49.400
On the other hand,

122
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:54.400
I fundamentally believe that people should invest for any number of reasons.

123
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.960
Maybe they just want to support women founders.

124
00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:02.120
Maybe they want to get some return back from that food truck and not necessarily

125
00:08:02.121 --> 00:08:04.160
a thousand x in a tech company.

126
00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:09.580
So if the vision is to build Amazon for private investing where you have

127
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:13.490
thousands and thousands of companies and millions and millions of people

128
00:08:13.491 --> 00:08:14.450
participating,

129
00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:19.810
then one of our core focus is to present as many options,

130
00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:22.580
credible,
viable options possible,

131
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:27.850
and let the crowd follow their heart and their head and make the decision for

132
00:08:27.891 --> 00:08:32.840
themselves.
All right,
so I got a better idea of,
of what you do at republic.
Uh,

133
00:08:32.841 --> 00:08:37.100
you allow everyone to make micro investment even a few dollars without over

134
00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:41.180
heads because the technology's there without legal constraints because the

135
00:08:41.181 --> 00:08:45.920
regulation has changed and there's this new highway of potential investment
open.

136
00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:51.050
Uh,
however,
my mother told me never to gamble.
Uh,
you know,
and,

137
00:08:51.051 --> 00:08:54.710
uh,
I don't know that I've been such a good son,
but,
uh,
what,

138
00:08:54.711 --> 00:08:59.580
what would you say about the risk reward and is this for everyone or is this

139
00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:01.290
something that,
you know,

140
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:05.520
how do you reassure me that you're not about to create the next subprime crisis

141
00:09:05.521 --> 00:09:09.330
with your idea?
Of course.
Uh,
you know,
even when it comes to gambling,

142
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.610
it's not so much that you should never gamble.

143
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:15.630
I think that people should do whatever it is they want to do with the fully

144
00:09:15.631 --> 00:09:19.530
aware of the risks and the consequences.
So you know,

145
00:09:19.531 --> 00:09:22.890
the gambling likely's going to result in total loss of money,

146
00:09:22.891 --> 00:09:27.750
but you have a lot of fun doing it and you can afford that $50 at a slot
machine.

147
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.480
By all mean in my opinion,
you should do it.

148
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.570
Obviously the rest of gambling is very high.

149
00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:38.520
Now when it comes to early stage investing,
the risk is still high,

150
00:09:38.521 --> 00:09:41.700
not as high,
but every single year,

151
00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:46.820
about a hundred billion dollars being spent at the casino,
not by millionaires,

152
00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:49.500
mostly by non accredited people,

153
00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:52.770
then at the $80 billion into a lottery tickets.

154
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:58.050
Can you imagine what the world would be with Silicon Valley and the US and the

155
00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:02.010
world at large would be 10% of that,

156
00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:07.020
$180 billion per year get invested or gambled informally into new innovations

157
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:15.570
that has that opportunity to change our world.
So basically you're saying,

158
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:20.550
uh,
the micro investment is worth the risk,
but you have to lose.

159
00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:23.340
It's a few dollars.
Uh,
what is,

160
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.820
what is the average amount of people that people spend on your platform?

161
00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:32.040
If I may a take the answer one question about money.

162
00:10:32.041 --> 00:10:35.970
This is my more like my personal view.
I think generally from what I observe,

163
00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.510
how people spend fall into three categories.

164
00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:44.460
One is the basic necessity,
you know,
putting food on the table by toothpaste,

165
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:49.440
feeding your kids,
you have kids.
The second one is for enjoyment,

166
00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:53.490
for value.
You know,
you go out and buy a nicer jacket.
You necessarily need,

167
00:10:53.491 --> 00:10:58.491
you take a kite surfing lesson and the third one is for growing that capital.

168
00:11:00.061 --> 00:11:03.390
They were able,
they will enable you to do number one and two.

169
00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:09.140
So obviously don't spend any money that you absolutely need to feed yourself and

170
00:11:10.171 --> 00:11:13.800
your family in the casino or in investing for that matter.

171
00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:19.020
When it comes to micro investing,
$100 $500 investing,

172
00:11:19.021 --> 00:11:23.640
not buying a product.
I think it's a blend between two and three.

173
00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:26.220
It is quite satisfying.

174
00:11:26.221 --> 00:11:31.221
If I really believe in that food short founder and her food and her resilience,

175
00:11:31.531 --> 00:11:32.364
then they,

176
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:37.700
and she decides to fundraise to build a Mexican restaurant and I invest $200

177
00:11:38.671 --> 00:11:43.440
into it.
You know,
if she doesn't make it,
I'm s I'm still rooting for her.

178
00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:46.050
Now if I'm investing $200,000 into it,

179
00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:49.090
I probably want to know that I can get you know,

180
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:52.380
the money back or that she would be so well that I could make you know,

181
00:11:52.381 --> 00:11:56.110
two or three times as much.
But when it comes to micro investing,

182
00:11:56.111 --> 00:11:56.944
you're going to be,

183
00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:02.450
you would be able to let people gamble or make informed decision and have fun

184
00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:07.210
between two and three.
How,
how is it different from crowdfunding?

185
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:13.710
Let me give a very quick definition of crowdfunding is a Kickstarter and

186
00:12:13.751 --> 00:12:18.751
Indiegogo whereby you go on and buy a product that hasn't been made.

187
00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:23.110
That's generation one of crowdfunding and that's back in 2008 or so.

188
00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:28.560
Then you have 2011 Angeles came into the mix that allow millionaires to co

189
00:12:29.531 --> 00:12:33.670
invest into tech deals.
So that's the second wave of it.

190
00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:37.690
And when Republic launch in 2016 that allows anyone,

191
00:12:37.691 --> 00:12:42.691
anywhere of any income and net worth invest as little as 10 or $20 into

192
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.950
businesses.
That's crowd investing still crowdfunding.

193
00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:53.460
I think all of us can agree that there's a different psychological attachment

194
00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:55.930
when you invest,

195
00:12:55.931 --> 00:13:00.370
when you have an interest in something compared to buying a product.

196
00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:05.710
I used to work for the guy who founded skyy vodka and I don't think there's a

197
00:13:05.711 --> 00:13:09.610
difference between absolute vodka inside skywalk here,
but if you,

198
00:13:09.611 --> 00:13:14.110
Bryce had made $50 investment into absolute,

199
00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:16.870
when you go out to the bar with me,

200
00:13:16.871 --> 00:13:19.990
at the end of the day you're going to buy me absolute shots,

201
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:23.830
you're going to serve up that kind of that brand of vodka,
you know,

202
00:13:23.831 --> 00:13:28.270
over the holidays in July 4th so that notion of engagement,

203
00:13:28.271 --> 00:13:30.310
of commitment,
of having skin in the game,

204
00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:34.540
I think is what going to drive crowd investing into a new trend.

205
00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:39.810
And indeed that's the underlying foundation of a token economy of using tokens

206
00:13:41.051 --> 00:13:43.450
to incentivize participants.

207
00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:44.360
<v 1>All right.</v>

208
00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:48.980
So what I understand is that crowdfunding might be more before there's a
product.

209
00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:49.890
Uh,

210
00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:54.380
micro investment is at the early stage when there is something and you know what

211
00:13:54.381 --> 00:13:55.520
you're investing into,

212
00:13:55.521 --> 00:13:59.210
but you still have attachment because you're in such an early contributor to

213
00:13:59.211 --> 00:14:02.900
this that you want to serve that vote cut your friends are or that strawberry

214
00:14:02.901 --> 00:14:03.470
juice

215
00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:06.890
<v 0>and then you potentially get that return and share in that outside</v>

216
00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:12.100
<v 1>growth because this is more a return on investment perspective than the</v>

217
00:14:12.111 --> 00:14:12.650
crowdfunding,

218
00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:17.570
which might be just you're buying something really and paying for it.
Correct.
Uh,

219
00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:22.630
and it's still early enough before there will be a stock exchange play that you

220
00:14:23.841 --> 00:14:27.710
have the huge reward curve if you're investing on the right thing and that your,

221
00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:31.790
your passion and your gut goes along with the market 100%.
All right.

222
00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:36.380
So thank you for all these explanations is already very,
very interesting.

223
00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:38.180
Now I would like to,
uh,

224
00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:43.040
to go on the step further because you are in the middle of a,

225
00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:47.990
of a lot of trends and each of them collide in which we're doing right now.

226
00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:52.730
Uh,
how do you see the future of,
uh,
of investment?
Because,

227
00:14:52.731 --> 00:14:56.780
so let's say that we public is the president of investment because I can go to

228
00:14:56.781 --> 00:14:59.000
there and repair because we have a big.co right?

229
00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:04.270
It's for everyone who wants to not a calm that club come all right.
Uh,

230
00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:06.250
you,
you,
you got rid of the m.
All right.

231
00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:10.820
And then so republic.co and what you are your platform and high works and

232
00:15:10.821 --> 00:15:14.960
operates.
Um,
so I understand the past,

233
00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:17.230
I understand the present and this,

234
00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:21.890
this very new initiative and interesting way to see it.
How do you,

235
00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:24.650
what are you going to launch?
What are you dreaming about?
How do you,

236
00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:28.130
how do you foresee the future?
What is your take on the future investments?

237
00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:30.110
<v 0>First,</v>

238
00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:35.110
let me just share one tidbit about the presence and the funding landscape.

239
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:41.590
I don't know how many people even here in at Google and in the heart of Silicon

240
00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.780
Valley,
realize that 50%,

241
00:15:44.781 --> 00:15:49.781
five zero of all venture capital go to businesses in California.

242
00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:55.070
But another 50% go to just social apps.
Um,

243
00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:56.930
African American founders,

244
00:15:57.110 --> 00:16:02.110
African American women founders are responsible for $30 billion worth of revenue

245
00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:06.200
businesses founded by African American founders,
uh,

246
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:10.970
responsible for tens of billions of dollars and statistically 0% get funded on

247
00:16:10.971 --> 00:16:11.810
certain years.

248
00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:16.730
So if we can agree that good ideas exist everywhere,

249
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.010
that no community,
no city,

250
00:16:19.011 --> 00:16:24.011
no heritage has a monopoly on innovations that if funded can mature into the

251
00:16:27.051 --> 00:16:30.980
Google,
the apple of the world 10 and 20 years from now,

252
00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:35.690
then there's a lot of work to get done.
So now to answer your question,

253
00:16:35.691 --> 00:16:39.890
what's the future?
I think the future is indeed that

254
00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:46.040
if not 80 or 90%,
then 50,
60,

255
00:16:46.041 --> 00:16:50.570
70% of adult would look at micro investing,

256
00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:55.220
10 and $20 at a time as a way,
as a new way,

257
00:16:55.221 --> 00:17:00.221
as a new spending behavior similar to or adding onto whatever else they've been

258
00:17:01.311 --> 00:17:04.400
doing.
Think of it as a social engagement,

259
00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:06.470
almost like recycling,

260
00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:11.860
but adding on to that potential for growing the capitol,

261
00:17:12.471 --> 00:17:15.950
that deceiving that you have.
And I think I just,

262
00:17:15.951 --> 00:17:20.951
no question in my mind that Amazon for private investing will be the future,

263
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:26.570
that people will be investing as easily and quickly and cheaply as buying a

264
00:17:26.571 --> 00:17:29.270
product on Amazon.
And once we get there,

265
00:17:29.271 --> 00:17:32.510
I think we can eradicate global poverty once and for,

266
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:37.750
because investing in a new day and age when technology reduces not increases

267
00:17:40.011 --> 00:17:40.880
jobs,

268
00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:46.420
how do you lower the income gap by allowing people to invest 10 20,

269
00:17:47.451 --> 00:17:52.140
$30 and have that opportunity to,
you know,

270
00:17:52.141 --> 00:17:55.590
get a major distribution and realize their potential.

271
00:17:55.990 --> 00:18:00.290
<v 1>Wow.
Wow.
It's a pretty bold vision.
Thank you for sharing it.
Um,</v>

272
00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:04.700
one thing that I forgot to ask you,
how do you make money for republic out of,

273
00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:09.490
out of this?
Like where you know,
how do,
how does your system operate financially?

274
00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:12.740
<v 0>Well currently full disclosure,
we are about three years out.</v>

275
00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:17.250
We definitely are not making money.
We are completely venture backed or losing a,

276
00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:20.760
we're very much in the red.
Hopefully one day will,
we will be making money,

277
00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:25.950
but we have a cash commissioned a out of the amount being raised as well as a

278
00:18:25.951 --> 00:18:30.951
small interest in every single company that successfully raises on republic.

279
00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:33.420
So in a way,

280
00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:38.450
if one of the companies that had raised on republic in 10 years,

281
00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:42.150
there's an IPO,
decides Uber,
Airbnb,

282
00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:44.940
then republic would do very well.

283
00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:50.360
Now we're going through an initiative that we aim to tokenize our future revenue

284
00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:56.810
and give them back to every user and investor and partner on republic so that if

285
00:18:58.561 --> 00:19:03.561
and when we get that major distribution that all the hundreds of thousands of

286
00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:09.300
early believers in republic can benefit in that as well monetary wise.

287
00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:12.190
So if I'm investing in ample foods and republic,

288
00:19:12.191 --> 00:19:16.530
I'm also some high investing in republic.
Correct?
So currently not yet.

289
00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:17.281
Currently,

290
00:19:17.281 --> 00:19:21.270
if you invest in ample food and if they get bought out for 10 bucks and you

291
00:19:21.271 --> 00:19:24.090
invest $100 you know,
give or take,

292
00:19:24.091 --> 00:19:26.100
you're going to get about a thousand dollars back.

293
00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:30.100
But very soon we will be giving for,

294
00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:33.870
for making an investment on ample food.
In any project.

295
00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.300
Let's say a hundred republic tokens,

296
00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:41.660
each token at one point will represent a portion of future income that republic

297
00:19:43.321 --> 00:19:44.670
takes it.
Okay.

298
00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:49.590
So that imagined back when in the early day,
um,

299
00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:54.920
when Amazon just had 10 companies on the platform and they had given out a

300
00:19:55.351 --> 00:20:00.351
billion tiny little slivers and each sliver represent revenue from each of the

301
00:20:01.651 --> 00:20:04.080
company at the time it may not mean much,

302
00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:08.430
but now 20 years later it can be very substantial.
So

303
00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:11.910
<v 1>that's very interesting because what I understand from this is that this way for</v>

304
00:20:11.911 --> 00:20:15.860
you to monetize your services for one thing tells us that you are,

305
00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:19.440
you will have skin in the game of the companies that are on your platform,

306
00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:22.710
that you believe in them enough that you took a small share yourselves.

307
00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:27.810
And the system also allows you to create the transaction system that is

308
00:20:27.811 --> 00:20:31.640
completely a zero cost,
right?
Like,

309
00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:36.950
like if I have a share of any company on your platform and in five years they

310
00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:39.900
are really doing super well.
I can divide my,

311
00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:44.510
my token in as many as I want because it's intrinsically,
uh,
divide.

312
00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:49.180
Dividable are you say you can infinitely divided and then transfer this to

313
00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:52.780
anyone globally in the world without any overhead or expense.

314
00:20:52.781 --> 00:20:54.100
Am I right in understanding this?

315
00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:56.590
<v 0>Yes.
Uh,
how Ma,</v>

316
00:20:56.630 --> 00:21:00.770
how much or how into how many pieces you break it down.
Uh,

317
00:21:00.771 --> 00:21:02.370
and who to granted it to.

318
00:21:02.371 --> 00:21:06.650
That's the realm of token economics and the different ways of incentivizing

319
00:21:06.651 --> 00:21:11.090
people would absolutely.
Back when we were still a private company,

320
00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:16.410
I'm an employee holding a thousand shares.
Um,

321
00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:20.210
in order for her to transfer it to her sister,

322
00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:23.870
say in Singapore,
um,

323
00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:26.780
first you got to get the consent of the company,

324
00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:29.150
then you have to go through the transfer agent,

325
00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:33.380
then you have to sign probably about four set of documents.

326
00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:37.220
Both counterparty signing the company would need to do background check,

327
00:21:37.221 --> 00:21:38.930
Kyc AML on the sister.

328
00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:43.070
And that's why that process is so inefficient.

329
00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:48.140
That transfer of private securities,
even today's heavily,

330
00:21:48.141 --> 00:21:53.141
heavily limited blockchain technology and the new application of it in the

331
00:21:56.240 --> 00:22:01.240
months and the years to come will make that process even more seamless than

332
00:22:01.311 --> 00:22:05.010
public stock trading today.
Um,
and I think again,

333
00:22:05.011 --> 00:22:10.011
it would just bring that more of that energy that fit into this burden,

334
00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:12.980
uh,
companies around the war.
Mm.

335
00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:17.550
<v 1>Um,
I don't want to talk about the offer side of the equation.
So we ran around,</v>

336
00:22:17.551 --> 00:22:19.530
we talked about uh,

337
00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:24.270
how you orchestrate the platform we talked and what liberated this initiative on

338
00:22:24.271 --> 00:22:28.670
the basis of technology and regulation changing.
We talked about the,
the,

339
00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.390
the part of the people who need funds.

340
00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:33.210
We talked a little bit about the part of the,
of the,
the investors.

341
00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:37.440
Let's say tomorrow I want to monetize something that has never been monetized

342
00:22:37.441 --> 00:22:38.190
before.

343
00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:41.940
So let's take an example that at Google we talk about a lot or we hear about a

344
00:22:41.941 --> 00:22:46.830
lot,
which is our data.
People say to me all the time,
how about my data?

345
00:22:46.831 --> 00:22:48.420
It has value,
you know,
a,

346
00:22:48.421 --> 00:22:52.530
and you use that value and there's a huge conversation because I think they gain

347
00:22:52.531 --> 00:22:55.950
value against that value from using the services for free.
And it has,

348
00:22:56.220 --> 00:23:00.930
it's a topic from DC to year,
uh,
down into the private citizen.
Yes.

349
00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:05.370
Right now it's,
it's like a very top of mind topic for everyone,

350
00:23:05.371 --> 00:23:06.450
especially in this day and age.

351
00:23:06.451 --> 00:23:10.860
So let's say tomorrow populations wanted to monetize their data,

352
00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:15.150
right?
That they would say,
right,
let's create a platform,

353
00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:18.630
uh,
together to put our data together.

354
00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:23.190
Maybe individually my data is not worth so much,
but maybe as part of,

355
00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:28.110
I dunno,
uh,
my income level in,
uh,
on the west coast or a,

356
00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:31.140
I'm France was part of the French community living abroad or you know,

357
00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:31.891
any identity.

358
00:23:31.891 --> 00:23:35.670
Maybe some companies would be interested in purchasing some of my data.

359
00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:41.150
Could I use a platform like republic and the new regulation and the arrival of

360
00:23:41.581 --> 00:23:46.581
blockchain to somehow put my data willingly on the market and decide how my data

361
00:23:48.121 --> 00:23:50.600
is going to be purchased,
traded board and so on,

362
00:23:50.601 --> 00:23:52.730
in a way that I feel to be transparent and empowered?

363
00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:54.631
<v 0>Absolutely.</v>

364
00:23:54.631 --> 00:23:58.770
Certainly not on republic today because we're currently a more of an investment

365
00:23:58.771 --> 00:24:03.750
platform,
but there are two elements of blockchain technology that would,

366
00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:06.300
in my opinion,
so of,
uh,

367
00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:10.680
in major ways or in meaningful ways the data privacy concern.

368
00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:16.370
One is that security but decentralized so that you don't have to worry about a

369
00:24:17.041 --> 00:24:21.630
central party holding or relevant information getting hacked.

370
00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:25.950
And so that in and of itself does ease the security concern.

371
00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:28.860
And the second one,
one of the main,

372
00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:35.300
using probably my own psychological attachment or assessment of this particular

373
00:24:37.141 --> 00:24:40.830
data question.
And I think that even though yes,

374
00:24:40.831 --> 00:24:42.150
I agree to the terms,

375
00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:47.420
but I didn't know quite that I was consenting to providing all of these personal

376
00:24:47.671 --> 00:24:51.270
information and data to a couple central parties.

377
00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:55.300
And I'm certainly not feeling like I'm being incentivized by,

378
00:24:56.670 --> 00:25:01.670
if you apply a token economy around it and enable people to make money when our

379
00:25:05.161 --> 00:25:06.390
share in that,

380
00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:11.410
that economic value of data and the choice to opt out,

381
00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:16.850
I think you're going to get so much opting in that net net,

382
00:25:16.921 --> 00:25:21.921
it benefits everyone and it's still serve that same purpose of using data to

383
00:25:22.351 --> 00:25:27.030
analyze,
to produce and put out better products that serve,

384
00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:29.520
you know,
human at large as a,
as a community.

385
00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:30.250
<v 1>All right.</v>

386
00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:34.060
So I took a very extreme case because very Demetria realized or people's data.

387
00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:39.540
But what I understand from this discussion of to now is that the shift in

388
00:25:39.671 --> 00:25:44.671
paradigm that you're here to talk to us about is both democratizing the

389
00:25:45.341 --> 00:25:50.341
investment and what is being proposed for investments and creating this new

390
00:25:50.501 --> 00:25:55.490
space in which people for the price of a lottery ticket could actually apply a

391
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:58.690
value to their values,
value to their commitments,

392
00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:01.900
participate to things that are already there and that are already started and

393
00:26:01.901 --> 00:26:05.260
visible and gain the traction of our investment.

394
00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:09.640
And that this is probably going to profoundly reshape the way we create

395
00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:12.560
monetization out of various elements of,

396
00:26:12.561 --> 00:26:16.570
of investment that today are still believed to be very restricted,

397
00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:21.130
to assist them with a cost base with knowledge and expertise and that maybe

398
00:26:21.131 --> 00:26:24.250
tomorrow all these things are going to fly out the window and will be available

399
00:26:24.251 --> 00:26:26.500
for a lot of people truly democratized

400
00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:31.870
<v 0>100%.
Um,
I think the next Facebook,
um,</v>

401
00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:36.900
the first investors in the next Facebook should not be pdf views of the world,

402
00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:42.910
but be the 500 door maids of the founders.

403
00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:45.270
Hopefully it doesn't have to be a Harvard.

404
00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:50.280
It can be a women's College of Pakistan and that the next wave of founders can

405
00:26:50.281 --> 00:26:55.281
be a single mom in Ecuador reading about it and putting in 10 and $20.

406
00:26:56.010 --> 00:27:01.010
And that by the time the banks in the venture funds or whatnot get in everyone

407
00:27:01.171 --> 00:27:05.280
else getting more and more and that when there's an IPO event,

408
00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:09.660
like the one that's going to produce a hundred thousand million years in the bay

409
00:27:09.661 --> 00:27:10.494
area,

410
00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:15.480
that they're going to be hundreds of thousands of people benefiting or at the

411
00:27:15.481 --> 00:27:18.300
same time.
So I think the last,
um,

412
00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:22.620
wave of venture capital the last 30 years is reduce,

413
00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:27.980
has lifted 1.3 billion people out of abject poverty in the world.

414
00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:32.790
We've been living in the most,
in a better time than ever before.

415
00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:38.570
But the much of the fruits of it in terms of wealth has gone back to the wealth

416
00:27:39.231 --> 00:27:41.050
ears and the institutions.

417
00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:46.700
If we can engage with courage everyone and make it possible as smaller mail for

418
00:27:48.061 --> 00:27:49.740
everyone to buy in.

419
00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:55.250
I think the world 20 years from now we'll probably be almost like sci fi fiction

420
00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:00.120
with a very little,
uh,
you know,

421
00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:05.070
the wealth is just across the boy and standard of living can be lifted from all

422
00:28:05.071 --> 00:28:07.770
corners of the world.
All right,
well thank you so much.

423
00:28:07.771 --> 00:28:08.940
This was very enlightening.

424
00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:12.960
I love both preparing this with you and having this conversation time for us to

425
00:28:12.961 --> 00:28:17.280
open to the rest of the audience.
Uh,
any question,

426
00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:20.790
any comments,
anything you would like to ask Kendrick please?

427
00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:23.510
<v 2>So I,
uh,
went,
uh,</v>

428
00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:27.960
to the platform and there is one thing that I don't understand here.
Um,

429
00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:32.550
when I invest a certain amount,
do I get equity in the company?

430
00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:37.190
Do I like going 2% of that startup now or how's that?

431
00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:38.083
Does that work?

432
00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:42.950
<v 0>So each of the deal on the investment,
and thank you so much for,
for joining.</v>

433
00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:47.510
Uh,
each of the Deos on the platform has its own set of terms.

434
00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:49.430
Some of the companies are ready,

435
00:28:49.431 --> 00:28:53.780
venture backed if raised tens of millions of dollars and now they just want to

436
00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:57.800
bring,
provide an opportunity for the customers and fence to get in.

437
00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:01.970
So typically would say evaluation for example,

438
00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:06.980
a document would say that you're investing $1,000 and at the company's valuation

439
00:29:07.851 --> 00:29:11.840
of $10 million.
So usually what investing,

440
00:29:11.841 --> 00:29:13.490
what that means is that later on,

441
00:29:13.491 --> 00:29:17.030
if Google buys that company at 100 million,

442
00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:22.600
then you would get a hundred acts give or take on your own personal investment.

443
00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:28.760
So in a way,
yes,
it's,
it's skin in the game is buying it.
It's not shit.

444
00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:33.790
There's a range of distinction between shares and stock and debt and save in

445
00:29:34.481 --> 00:29:35.570
convertible notes.

446
00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:40.250
But the general thesis is very much the same that if the company does well,

447
00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:45.610
you do well proportional these so as well to contrast against buying a product

448
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:50.110
or making a loan and get a fixed income return back.

449
00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.900
So sharing that success in that Ruth,

450
00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:57.960
I think he's a psychological satisfaction and validation that a lot of people in

451
00:30:00.341 --> 00:30:04.820
tech have experience.
Has that answered your question?
Yes.

452
00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:09.730
And to be very clear for everyone who hears this cause we all understand the

453
00:30:09.731 --> 00:30:12.580
concept of share and being a shareholder.
Uh,

454
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.050
when I invest through republic,
what am I and what do I have?

455
00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:20.860
How do you call this?
What is it?
You are an investor,
okay.

456
00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:25.890
But in most cases you're not a shale who do yet you chose an investor to make it

457
00:30:26.051 --> 00:30:28.510
simple for the company and the founders.

458
00:30:29.050 --> 00:30:34.050
So in Fintech is a confluence of law and regulations and the one hand and

459
00:30:34.451 --> 00:30:37.780
innovation on the end.
So you have a set of laws.

460
00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:42.820
It was written some Ed years ago at the time when the world we live in wasn't

461
00:30:43.301 --> 00:30:48.301
even on anyone's mind and how to apply these rules to make it possible for a

462
00:30:49.421 --> 00:30:49.810
word.

463
00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:54.810
Now that you can have a million investors at a very early stage into it because

464
00:30:56.051 --> 00:31:00.970
of that need do new inch,
Julian's leg,
convertible notes like to save,

465
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.920
et cetera.
But you are an investor shareholder not is far less material.

466
00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:10.680
But typically at one point you will become a shareholder and then you get paid

467
00:31:10.681 --> 00:31:13.960
out in cash show.
All right.
So,
and what would be that point?

468
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:15.080
Like when do you make the,

469
00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:19.630
the shift from being an investor to being a shareholder?
Yep.
So,
uh,

470
00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:24.520
the instrument that we created to make it possible for founders and companies to

471
00:31:24.521 --> 00:31:29.521
deal with so many people is that if and when they experience a liquidity event,

472
00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:33.790
meaning a merger acquisition or going IPO,

473
00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:37.330
then they will convert everyone into shareholders.

474
00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.340
And then because you're a shareholder,

475
00:31:39.341 --> 00:31:43.480
you get payout or get cashed out and then leave the company.
All right.

476
00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:48.780
Because otherwise if you keep 10 million shareholders and the cap table,

477
00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:54.270
the cost of administering it is exceedingly high to comply with corporate law.

478
00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:58.200
All right.
Very good.
Thank you so much for the question.
Very,
very good question.

479
00:31:58.201 --> 00:31:59.500
I thank you so much for your detailed answer.

480
00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:03.240
<v 3>I have a question or I see or initial coin offerings.</v>

481
00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:07.860
It's a mini startups are doing that in the last few years and uh,

482
00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:11.870
frankly most of them are scams.
You're not late.

483
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:16.470
You're a client to get 10 $20 million and then nothing anything.

484
00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:21.780
Then as he started regulating that for,
for bigger ICLS.

485
00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:22.870
So what,

486
00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:27.440
what's your view on the smaller ones which are still happening and even sitting?

487
00:32:27.441 --> 00:32:29.670
Can volumes sometimes or one word?

488
00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:33.480
<v 0>Uh,
I think that's a great question.
Um,
you know,</v>

489
00:32:33.481 --> 00:32:38.481
when the ICO boom in 2017 in 2016,

490
00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:43.940
um,
it gave all of us at republic,
you know,

491
00:32:43.941 --> 00:32:48.941
warm and fuzzy feelings all over because it's a true real life validation of our

492
00:32:50.181 --> 00:32:55.181
model in the future where thousands of individuals and not venture capitalist

493
00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:59.990
finance,
random projects and companies not here in silicon valley,

494
00:32:59.991 --> 00:33:03.290
not out of Google but can be out of Singapore or wherever.

495
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:08.830
So crowd investing in its best form was ICO back in 2020 16 now it was done in a

496
00:33:13.821 --> 00:33:16.970
noncompliant way with us securities law.

497
00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:21.650
So the law caught on.
And so now you apply laws and regulations,

498
00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:26.710
many of which are meant to prevent fraud and scams perpetuated on the investing

499
00:33:27.681 --> 00:33:30.770
public.
But it does come with bells and whistle.

500
00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:34.790
So it makes it a little bit more difficult for people to participate,

501
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.770
know your customer,
anti money laundering and whatnot.
So you seeing a,

502
00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:44.980
in many ways a healthy contraction of that type of financial product.

503
00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:51.040
But at republic we tried to make that compliant in easy and get back to one

504
00:33:51.681 --> 00:33:55.790
point when a credible project can braise 10,

505
00:33:55.791 --> 00:34:00.350
$20 million without having to go and pound the pavement on sand hill road

506
00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:04.790
because she happens to be not living in America and not economically possible to

507
00:34:04.791 --> 00:34:05.900
do that.
Um,

508
00:34:05.901 --> 00:34:10.901
so I'm very optimistic about blockchain technology and startups that are built

509
00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:15.760
or leverage that technology in the long run.
Uh,

510
00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:18.350
and republic itself is applying some of that as well.

511
00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:21.760
<v 1>Oh,
and I wanted also to,
you know,</v>

512
00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:24.790
highlight something and I will just let you answer to this,

513
00:34:24.791 --> 00:34:26.890
but you could say I'd republic,

514
00:34:26.891 --> 00:34:30.750
we do this and republic with the only you in a garage in Palo Alto,
uh,

515
00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:33.550
or it could be a,
you know,
a bigger team.

516
00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:36.820
So can you tell us a little bit more about,
you know,
under the hood,

517
00:34:36.821 --> 00:34:40.440
like your organization,
how many people you are,
where they are located?
Uh,

518
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:42.103
this one

519
00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:43.400
<v 0>definitely.
I,
uh,</v>

520
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:48.430
I was a general counsel for Angel List and we spun out and set up shop in New

521
00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:51.740
York because that's the seat of the capital market.

522
00:34:51.741 --> 00:34:54.730
And most people still have never invested privately.
Uh,

523
00:34:54.731 --> 00:34:59.731
so our team probably slightly different than a lot of true tech startup in the

524
00:35:00.141 --> 00:35:02.690
valley,
but we're pretty equal purposely.

525
00:35:02.691 --> 00:35:07.691
So between engineering business and then obviously compliance being an

526
00:35:08.271 --> 00:35:11.590
investment company are,
there are about 50 of us,
uh,

527
00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:13.580
have most of the New York,

528
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:17.940
there's a small office in services school among the team,
just seven former too.

529
00:35:17.941 --> 00:35:21.130
And he's turned business or engineer,
uh,

530
00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:26.120
to navigate this confluence of legal and innovation.
Um,
and uh,

531
00:35:26.121 --> 00:35:28.610
we have a mildly distributed team,

532
00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:31.760
but there's still a core team based out of new,
yeah.

533
00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:36.540
<v 1>All right.
So I'm,
I'm here.
What I,
what I meant to,
to get from you,
which I do get,</v>

534
00:35:36.541 --> 00:35:38.160
is that this is not just

535
00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:41.910
<v 0>your,
or are two or three people in a garage.
And he sees that like,</v>

536
00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:45.990
so did you get enough organized already that you have some very serious people

537
00:35:45.991 --> 00:35:49.530
in every department of this making sure that this work,
this is tenable,

538
00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:52.050
this efficient and compliant anyway?
Oh,
absolutely.

539
00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:57.030
Because we're so heavily regulated for touching retail investor.

540
00:35:57.031 --> 00:35:58.320
I think we've been audited.

541
00:35:58.321 --> 00:36:02.310
Something like that does in terms by Finra and sec in two and a half years,

542
00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:05.310
it was why we were so many lawyers in house.
Um,

543
00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:10.700
we have under Business Benj people who've background experience at black rock at

544
00:36:11.131 --> 00:36:11.964
Mckinsey,

545
00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:17.450
one of our founding advisor founded the Malala Fund whose worked God Malala the

546
00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:22.950
Nobel Peace Prize.
So,
uh,
influence servers and what have you,
uh,
chase and kid,

547
00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:27.910
the athlete is a chameleon near the wrapper,
uh,
both,
uh,

548
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:30.030
advisors and influencers for us.

549
00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:34.140
So to do and to build on this vision,

550
00:36:34.141 --> 00:36:37.700
it takes more than a village.
It takes partnership and,
uh,

551
00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:42.540
the goodwill of people across all different sectors of society.

552
00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:45.710
I know that it's very hard to determine a valuation of a company,

553
00:36:45.711 --> 00:36:48.710
particularly very early on.
So,
uh,

554
00:36:48.711 --> 00:36:52.620
what does republics involvement in valuing a company before they,
uh,

555
00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:55.430
create an offering on your site?

556
00:36:55.610 --> 00:37:00.610
And how will that scale as you have thousands or millions of companies platform?

557
00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:05.460
Uh,
thanks again for the question and valuation in due diligence.

558
00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:07.890
So in the past two and a half years,
we've gotten,

559
00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:12.840
I think by now almost 5,000 applications and we've done due diligence on,

560
00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:15.480
depending on the level of due diligence,
but not all of them.

561
00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:19.620
And we've launched less than 5%,
uh,
on republic.

562
00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:24.120
When it comes to valuation,
there's actually no real math,

563
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:27.360
particularly for an early company,
your evaluations,

564
00:37:27.361 --> 00:37:29.670
whatever investors are willing to invest in you.

565
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:35.150
So we typically look at if they have raised money before,

566
00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:39.090
then use that as a potential point of data.

567
00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:42.000
It may have never raised money before.

568
00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:47.210
Then we want to make sure that it is at least in line with the current

569
00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:49.530
ecosystem.
To give you an example,

570
00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:52.770
YC startups typically raised at about 10,

571
00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:55.470
$15 million in valuation.

572
00:37:55.710 --> 00:38:00.060
Pre-Product premarket just to do in New York,

573
00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:04.440
the same team out of New York City would be probably 25,

574
00:38:04.441 --> 00:38:09.441
30% less in valuation because venture capitalists in New York aren't just as

575
00:38:09.841 --> 00:38:14.430
willing to fund a company.
There's value at 15 million pre market.

576
00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:20.090
So applying all of these relative lens that we pass a reasonableness and it's

577
00:38:21.301 --> 00:38:26.301
still up to the founders to do the work and convince investors and strangers and

578
00:38:26.731 --> 00:38:30.960
families and friends to make that investment.
Kendrick,

579
00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:35.980
what are some of the challenges of expanding these investment opportunities to

580
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.710
<v 4>international markets outside of the u s</v>

581
00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:42.910
<v 0>Oh,
thanks Colby.
Uh,
on our platform today,</v>

582
00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:45.940
the companies have to be based in the u s when now,

583
00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:49.460
even though we have partnership with different platforms in order continents,

584
00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:54.710
but we have investors from like 30 or 40 countries around the world investing on

585
00:38:55.181 --> 00:38:58.050
Republic,
uh,
going back to a writer,

586
00:38:58.051 --> 00:39:01.780
tried steam in the good ideas exists everywhere.
Um,

587
00:39:01.781 --> 00:39:06.670
I really look forward to today where,
you know,
people here and in New York,

588
00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:09.310
uh,
at lunchtime,
go on it.

589
00:39:09.311 --> 00:39:11.950
Look at a bunch of companies in Africa or Latin America.

590
00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:17.160
And this our small amount and happened to build and make meaningful businesses

591
00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:20.260
that create jobs in those regions.
Uh,

592
00:39:20.261 --> 00:39:23.560
so the future is very much global when it comes to entrepreneurship.

593
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:28.400
<v 4>Uh,
so you talk about my,
you invest in and you must 20 set of dollars,
uh,
company.</v>

594
00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:33.700
Uh,
but given the high bs of early stage startups,
one has too many,

595
00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:36.740
most a 100 200 companies to everybody should the VSM written.

596
00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:41.480
So how do you find the average John Doe can manage such a large portfolio?

597
00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:45.850
<v 0>Uh,
when it comes to the very high rates of angel investing,</v>

598
00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:48.730
the name of the game is diversification as you mentioned.

599
00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:52.510
So on Angel List as an example,
at the minimum amount,

600
00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:54.880
usually it's higher than a thousand dollars,

601
00:39:54.970 --> 00:39:57.850
but the lowest is got to be $1,000.

602
00:39:58.750 --> 00:40:02.020
That's a lot of money for most people in this world.

603
00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:07.620
If you can reduce that down to $100 and allow $10 investment into 10 companies,

604
00:40:08.830 --> 00:40:10.690
that changes the landscape of things.

605
00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:15.190
And hopefully at one point we can even bring it down to like $5 at $2 and my

606
00:40:15.191 --> 00:40:19.360
family immigrated here from Vietnam.
And I remember when we first moved here,

607
00:40:19.361 --> 00:40:23.380
my mom used to send back like a hundred dollars a month to a couple of her

608
00:40:23.381 --> 00:40:24.214
sisters.

609
00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:29.400
The transaction fee on that transaction was I think 13 or $14 to the sister in a

610
00:40:31.241 --> 00:40:35.800
larger city and like $17 to someone in a smaller town,

611
00:40:37.090 --> 00:40:40.810
which is absurd.
But it was,
that's what everyone lived with.

612
00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:45.880
Now in a day,
given a Vietnam is very warm to like crypto technology,

613
00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:50.590
you can make the same transaction in the fee be less than a dollar.
So,

614
00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:54.190
and we're too where like 2:00 AM into this new day.

615
00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:57.090
So I have no doubt that a couple of years out,

616
00:40:57.670 --> 00:41:00.610
a person with a $50 saving,

617
00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:05.200
not the money that she needs to put food on the table would be able to deploy

618
00:41:05.201 --> 00:41:10.201
the $50 into 10 or 20 companies and still potentially get a meaningful return

619
00:41:10.301 --> 00:41:11.480
out of it.
Net,
the,

620
00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:16.000
<v 5>is this micro transaction model really better than the Angel List Syndicate</v>

621
00:41:16.001 --> 00:41:20.830
model where you have some professional that goes in and vets the invest like the

622
00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:24.280
companies a little better first because we know that even some of the best

623
00:41:24.281 --> 00:41:28.090
investors don't actually succeed better than the s and p 500.
So

624
00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:31.090
<v 0>the question about,
uh,</v>

625
00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:36.140
venture validation and a lead investing is addressed in two different ways.

626
00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:38.870
Just because you allow my co investing,

627
00:41:38.871 --> 00:41:41.690
it doesn't mean that you wouldn't have that validation.

628
00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:47.050
So I think 27 or 28% of the companies on republic had been venture backed,

629
00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:52.400
so already went through that Lens.
Now on the other hand,

630
00:41:52.850 --> 00:41:57.850
the problem with venture investing is that a fund Lysa Coya would only pick

631
00:41:59.361 --> 00:42:04.361
startups that they think potentially can you them the proverbial Unicorn 50 acts

632
00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:09.530
at the very least,
20 x five acts not interesting.

633
00:42:09.531 --> 00:42:12.260
It's not enough that fits into the economic model.

634
00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:17.600
If you have two founders building a business in east Oakland,

635
00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:21.980
they will never be more than a $20 million company.

636
00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:27.380
But that creates 500 jobs for single moms in East Oakland.

637
00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:32.650
And you happen to just want to support that particular business and get two or

638
00:42:32.841 --> 00:42:36.900
three acts back that currently you don't have that,

639
00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:40.460
that avenue on Angel List with an eventual fund.

640
00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:43.100
So I view entrepreneurship and investing,

641
00:42:43.101 --> 00:42:46.460
it has to be Silicon Valley's then a lot of good,

642
00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:50.030
but there's like v two,
we now ready flight.

643
00:42:50.050 --> 00:42:54.920
That next stage that people have a say in the type of businesses they get

644
00:42:54.921 --> 00:42:59.540
finance and that will create a word we will live in,
in 10 years from now.

645
00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:00.740
Uh,

646
00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:05.720
you mentioned that republic will take a portion of other companies that are on

647
00:43:05.721 --> 00:43:06.261
your platform.

648
00:43:06.261 --> 00:43:09.840
Can you share what that is and is that consistent for each company?
Yeah,

649
00:43:09.850 --> 00:43:14.840
so currently I'm just going to use a very specific use case.
So there's a,

650
00:43:14.841 --> 00:43:18.530
a company that raise on republic,
uh,

651
00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:22.730
when we first launched six months out and now she has gone on to raise

652
00:43:22.731 --> 00:43:25.550
additional capital from VC.
The founder,

653
00:43:25.551 --> 00:43:30.551
I'm a Latina mom who was working for a corporate,

654
00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:34.670
uh,
incorporate for grocery chain,
doesn't have a technical background,

655
00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:37.970
doesn't fit the lens of someone who would get venture vacuum.

656
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:40.640
And she just needed that 50,

657
00:43:40.641 --> 00:43:45.520
$60,000 to bill out the first model,
hire a,

658
00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:49.940
you know,
an engineer and a business person and grow.
So we were like,
all right,

659
00:43:50.090 --> 00:43:55.090
we think that she's incredible and resilient and her experience saving money is

660
00:43:55.191 --> 00:43:57.020
so relevant to building a business.

661
00:43:57.050 --> 00:44:01.070
So we launch a campaign and she raised about $80,000.

662
00:44:01.450 --> 00:44:03.980
A lot of it was financed by,
you know,

663
00:44:03.981 --> 00:44:07.280
Latino American professionals in the bay area and beyond,

664
00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:11.600
out of that $80,000,
uh,
the,

665
00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:15.290
the time and money that we've deployed into,
it was probably,

666
00:44:15.291 --> 00:44:18.890
I'm going to guess 20,000 it'd being the very first project,

667
00:44:19.310 --> 00:44:24.310
but the math is that we get 6% out of their mouth successfully raised.

668
00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:30.100
So 6% of 80,000 plus we get a security interest in her company worth 2% of the

669
00:44:33.361 --> 00:44:34.170
amount raised.

670
00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:39.170
So in this case is $1,600 worth of her equity if she,

671
00:44:40.231 --> 00:44:45.231
she's building an employment training platform that trains very low level

672
00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:49.710
employees to mid level management,

673
00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:55.610
the shopping bag cashier at Safeway and lucky into assistant manager.

674
00:44:57.810 --> 00:45:00.540
If she somehow becomes the linkedin of the world,

675
00:45:00.570 --> 00:45:04.460
that 1.6099999999999999 $1,600 take.

676
00:45:04.490 --> 00:45:07.890
We have maybe worth millions.
And if that's the case,

677
00:45:07.891 --> 00:45:10.560
we're going to send that back to investors.

678
00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:14.150
<v 1>Thank you so much.
Can for joining.
And I want to thank you for two things.</v>

679
00:45:14.151 --> 00:45:18.620
The first thing is sharing with us your knowledge and your,

680
00:45:18.621 --> 00:45:20.990
and your experience and your,
you know,

681
00:45:20.991 --> 00:45:25.760
your company's history and life and mission,
which was very interesting.

682
00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:29.180
And the other thing also is I want to thank you for sharing your story because

683
00:45:29.181 --> 00:45:32.090
it's very inspiring.
You being,
you know,
coming from Vietnam,

684
00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:37.130
having grown to be a a Stanford fellow at Stanford low,

685
00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:40.400
uh,
becoming an entrepreneur,
connecting back to the world,

686
00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:42.980
giving it back to the world as,
you know,
what we'll,
we,

687
00:45:43.310 --> 00:45:47.300
we really embrace diversity.
We want not only diversity but inclusion.

688
00:45:47.301 --> 00:45:50.150
Like it's not only euro in the nightclub which were invited to dance,
right?

689
00:45:50.151 --> 00:45:54.700
So inclusion and what everything you say,
uh,

690
00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:58.310
speeds a positive lights on,
on the world,
uh,

691
00:45:58.311 --> 00:46:02.630
on how it's doing and high is going to become and on these values that we hold

692
00:46:02.631 --> 00:46:04.880
very dear.
And you're living example of those values,

693
00:46:05.090 --> 00:46:07.790
connecting technology to good business,
too.

694
00:46:07.791 --> 00:46:11.270
Good too good value on initiatives from people respecting what we call here,

695
00:46:11.271 --> 00:46:16.190
respecting the opportunity,
uh,
and all this in great ethics and transparency.

696
00:46:16.191 --> 00:46:19.130
So thank you for all of this.
It was a pleasure having you.

697
00:46:19.131 --> 00:46:20.930
I'm so thrilled to have had you today.
You know,

698
00:46:20.931 --> 00:46:24.560
and I'm looking forward to everything that's going to happen for republic in the

699
00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:26.630
coming years and I want to wish you the best of success.

700
00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:27.451
<v 0>Thank you so much.</v>

701
00:46:27.451 --> 00:46:30.540
Bryce is truly an honor to be here and I want to thank everybody we will for

702
00:46:30.541 --> 00:46:34.320
having me.
I think the model of do good,
uh,

703
00:46:34.321 --> 00:46:36.670
is something that's like close to my heart.
Uh,

704
00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:40.860
Google is the first company that put to good to get it with profit and that's

705
00:46:40.861 --> 00:46:45.240
what gave rise to republic.
And you know,
on the personal level is incrementally,

706
00:46:45.241 --> 00:46:49.180
we do what we can to live up to something that you guys have perpetuated or

707
00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:52.360
throughout the globe.
So thank you so much.
All right.
Pleasure.
Thank you,
Eric.

708
00:46:52.490 --> 00:46:52.820
Thank you.
