WEBVTT

1
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.390
Thank you very much.
It's a pleasure to be here.
So thank you for the invitation.

2
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.770
Um,
as young was saying,
I'm a sociologist that Goldsmiths,

3
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.180
um,
I'm interested in citizenship and gender and technology and invention,

4
00:00:24.181 --> 00:00:27.000
which is very much what this book is all about.
Um,

5
00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:30.330
so I'm going to tell you a little bit about the research project that underpins

6
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.250
this new publication and this extensively about Victorian engineering,

7
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.120
the history of patenting as radical feminists,
cultures of invention,

8
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.330
but I'm here to do pretty much is a bit of cycling,

9
00:00:42.331 --> 00:00:44.190
sewing and suffrage storytelling.

10
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.380
So my research tells a story of inventors who helped to shape the landscape in

11
00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:54.381
which women could move and new ways independently unchaperoned in public space

12
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.960
who embraced a plethora of new technologies such as the bicycle,

13
00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.160
the sewing machine,

14
00:00:59.161 --> 00:01:03.990
you waterproof and woolen fabrics and a range of new media and who pushed it,

15
00:01:03.991 --> 00:01:08.910
the perimeters of established forms of gendered citizenship.
And all of this,

16
00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:12.360
I believe and I will argue,
can be told through the history of cycle where,

17
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.340
but first of all,
why am I looking at cycle where in the first place?

18
00:01:17.341 --> 00:01:21.450
Why does cycle,
where matter?
Can I find out who's a cyclist here?

19
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.710
Oh,
okay.
Quite a lot of you.
Terrific.
Okay.
Um,

20
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.640
so initially the idea for this came from an amazing postdoc that I'd been doing,

21
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.320
um,
where I was,
I'm studying,
um,
contemporary cycling research.

22
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.960
Um,
and it was about the cultures of cycling.

23
00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:40.830
I was looking at four different field sites around the UK with Rachel Oldroyd

24
00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:41.970
and her great project.

25
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.200
I'm exploring in some cases why cycle rates in some places in the UK when much

26
00:01:47.341 --> 00:01:48.300
high than others.

27
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.830
It involved a whole mixed methods approach of ethnography in a lot of
interviews.

28
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.550
Um,
but I was really struck by how unprovoked please come in,

29
00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.980
um,

30
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.540
how unprovoked cyclists would often talk about what they would wear to cycle and

31
00:02:03.541 --> 00:02:07.500
the effect this had on other users in some circumstances looking like a proper

32
00:02:07.501 --> 00:02:12.060
cyclist enabled people to carve out cycling identities and kind of legitimize

33
00:02:12.061 --> 00:02:14.130
the space on the road and in others.

34
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.150
And women were particularly articulate about this and it's being visibly

35
00:02:18.151 --> 00:02:19.620
identifiable as a cyclist,

36
00:02:19.621 --> 00:02:24.390
sometimes resulted in unwelcome responses from other road users and people also

37
00:02:24.391 --> 00:02:28.110
seem to identify with this struggle to find appropriate clothing,

38
00:02:28.111 --> 00:02:32.550
the fitted on the bike and also for when you arrived at your destination and

39
00:02:32.551 --> 00:02:36.930
female cyclist also lamented the limited range of cycle where are available to

40
00:02:36.931 --> 00:02:39.720
them in relation to what was available for men more broadly.

41
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.480
They talked about having to hack or adapt their own clothing,

42
00:02:42.481 --> 00:02:46.230
buy men's wear and do things with that because they felt there was a limited

43
00:02:46.231 --> 00:02:47.730
kind of high tech range for them.

44
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.840
And at the time also the media was starting to identify a particular type of

45
00:02:51.841 --> 00:02:54.780
dress cyclist,
the Lycra lout,
um,

46
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.900
and here a seemingly appropriate technical materiality for cycling Lycra was

47
00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:03.490
becoming shorthand for kind of an anti social form of mobility.

48
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.990
So clearly what cyclists wall mattered and it mattered a lot.

49
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.600
So I began to ask,
why does cycle,
where matter,

50
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.250
where do these anxieties come from and what can we learn about what we wear to

51
00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:18.910
cycle today from learning more about what we've worn in the past.

52
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.020
So my research focuses on a very small period of history,

53
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.480
1895 to 1899.

54
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.070
It was a radical intersection of new technology and social and cultural change.

55
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.620
And it was when the bicycle booms swept through this country.
Um,

56
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.320
and it was also a time of address reform and emancipation activities.

57
00:03:38.321 --> 00:03:42.730
We're gaining kind of traction advocating for more women's rights and freedoms.

58
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.950
There's a growth of new printed media,

59
00:03:44.951 --> 00:03:48.790
particularly around cycling periodicals and an influx of new ideas from

60
00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:50.050
travelers from abroad.

61
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.540
So I've been looking particularly at what early cyclists war to ride bikes and

62
00:03:55.541 --> 00:03:59.500
cycle where really provides an interesting lens,
I think,
into society.

63
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.210
So as a sociologist,

64
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.280
I consider clothing as a device that reflects and also producers,
social,

65
00:04:06.281 --> 00:04:08.230
cultural and political worlds.

66
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.190
And clothing is not just something that covers or protects bodies,

67
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.300
but thinking of it as a technology that enables and constrains different forms

68
00:04:16.301 --> 00:04:19.030
of mobility.
And in the 1890s,

69
00:04:19.031 --> 00:04:22.150
clothing was a critical means through each bodies are made to fit both

70
00:04:22.151 --> 00:04:25.960
physically and also ideologically with changing ideas about being in a,

71
00:04:25.961 --> 00:04:29.380
moving through public space and attaching to all these new and exciting

72
00:04:29.381 --> 00:04:33.910
technologies and somebodies fitted much easier with these new technologies and

73
00:04:33.911 --> 00:04:35.710
somebody had to be made to fit.

74
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.160
So I've been focusing particularly on middle and upper class women because they

75
00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.260
were at the cutting edge of fashion.

76
00:04:44.261 --> 00:04:47.860
They had money to embrace new technology as well as the leisure time to enjoy
it.

77
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.780
Um,
they had exposure to media and ideas from around the world and the social and

78
00:04:52.781 --> 00:04:57.730
cultural capital to push back against conventional social codes and norms.

79
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.580
So what was happening in the 1890s?

80
00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.330
I'm going to set the scene a little bit with a letter.
Um,

81
00:05:04.331 --> 00:05:09.250
it was written in 1897 by kitty j Buckman to a friend of hers about her cycling

82
00:05:09.251 --> 00:05:13.420
experiences.
And she writes this,
she says,
many says,

83
00:05:13.421 --> 00:05:15.820
Oxford is the most bigoted place in the kingdom.

84
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.730
It certainly cannot be worse to write an Oxford then in London,

85
00:05:18.731 --> 00:05:22.620
especially London suburbs.
It's awful.
One one's nerves of iron,

86
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.160
the shouts in the yells of children,

87
00:05:24.161 --> 00:05:28.210
defin won the women's Shriek with laughter or grown and his and all sorts of

88
00:05:28.211 --> 00:05:31.390
remarks or shouted occasionally,
some not fit for publication.

89
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.440
One needs to be very brave to stand all that and it makes one feel mad.

90
00:05:35.441 --> 00:05:38.740
And one's idea of humanity at large sink to a very low standard.

91
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.500
So,
um,

92
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.670
kitty clearly loves cycling and there's lots of letters between her and her

93
00:05:45.671 --> 00:05:47.260
friends about how much they loved it.

94
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.160
But the fact that she says it took nerves of iron to ride it clearly wasn't

95
00:05:51.161 --> 00:05:56.161
always a relaxing or I'm safe pastime in late 19th century Britain rather as

96
00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.130
evoked by these letters.

97
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.110
It was fraught with verbal and sometimes even physical assault,
um,

98
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.390
from general public in some places.
So why was this,

99
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.880
why did mobile women get treated in this way?

100
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.290
What were they doing and wearing to elicit such social violence?
And how,

101
00:06:12.291 --> 00:06:15.500
and in what ways did they respond?
So,

102
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:19.790
so both men and women really enthusiastically took to cycling,

103
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.030
but they both had very different experiences.
In the 1890s,

104
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:27.560
it was considerably easier for upper class men initially because their bodies

105
00:06:27.561 --> 00:06:32.380
and society's understandings about masculine mobility and their closing meant

106
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:36.860
they fitted with the bicycle much more easily.
And as Jennifer Hargraves rights,

107
00:06:36.861 --> 00:06:39.920
you know,
sports constituted a unique form of cultural life.

108
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:44.030
There were overwhelmingly symbols of masculinity and chauvinism embodying

109
00:06:44.031 --> 00:06:45.890
aggressive displays,
a physical power and,

110
00:06:45.891 --> 00:06:47.900
and competitiveness in the 19th century.

111
00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:51.230
There's no question that sports were the natural domain of men and to be good at

112
00:06:51.231 --> 00:06:52.910
them was essentially masculine.

113
00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:59.090
And the popularity of cycling and cycle racing in particular really helped to

114
00:06:59.091 --> 00:07:02.900
shape kind of men's attachment to cycling as well as their cycle where

115
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:08.170
reinforcing it's masculine appeal and cutting edge designs for racing bites also

116
00:07:08.211 --> 00:07:12.960
trickled down into the consumer market.
Some men were much more easily to um,

117
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:17.360
to adopt a confident hightech cycling consumer right from the start.

118
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:22.820
And a slew of popular periodicals such as these,
the hub and the wheeler.
Um,

119
00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:27.880
we're very quick to respond to this popular interest and they regularly publish

120
00:07:27.901 --> 00:07:31.820
details of all the racing events and showcased winners in collectible kind of

121
00:07:31.821 --> 00:07:35.840
commemorative posters like this.
So you can see kind of a discourse of heroism.

122
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.800
We're embedded in these accounts that powerfully linked masculinity and cycling.

123
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:44.840
We see language such as speed and agility and performance champion professional

124
00:07:44.841 --> 00:07:46.520
and skill.
Um,

125
00:07:46.521 --> 00:07:49.850
and you can see also a men's clothing wasn't terribly much of an issue here

126
00:07:49.851 --> 00:07:52.640
either.
They were much more easily able to discard things.

127
00:07:52.641 --> 00:07:56.090
We're seeing that was seen as kind of problematic on a bicycle to the point

128
00:07:56.091 --> 00:07:57.740
where there's not much even happening there.

129
00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:03.220
And a to the left you can see almost the prelude to kind of cycling skin suits

130
00:08:04.161 --> 00:08:06.590
even happening a hundred over 110 years ago.

131
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:09.560
So women in cycling,

132
00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:14.510
women to found cycling incredibly exciting and we can probably barely imagine

133
00:08:14.511 --> 00:08:18.720
the parallel sense of kind of excitement and freedom and independence that would

134
00:08:18.721 --> 00:08:20.990
have come from cycling at that time for them,

135
00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:25.220
however their bodies and dress and mobile engagement and public space,

136
00:08:25.221 --> 00:08:26.810
we're much more complicated.

137
00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:31.610
Up until the mid 1880s middle and upper class women's bodies in Victorian

138
00:08:31.611 --> 00:08:36.410
society were defined by the moral responsibility of reproduction and deeply

139
00:08:36.411 --> 00:08:41.411
rooted in kind of one place being the home exercise was deemed unnecessary and

140
00:08:41.491 --> 00:08:45.500
healthy even,
and even detrimental to our matrimonial duties.

141
00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:50.450
Given her main purpose was the caring and bearing of children and fashions may

142
00:08:50.451 --> 00:08:54.050
not have been always as complicated as this French,
um,
visiting dress.

143
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:55.063
But they stencil,

144
00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:58.800
I mean forced many of these beliefs about women's role in society.

145
00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:02.820
They can prized up to seven pounds of heavy petticoats long,
um,

146
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:07.890
floor length skirts,
um,
tightly laced corset,
blouses,
jackets,
fails,

147
00:09:07.891 --> 00:09:09.960
hats,
gloves,
and much more.

148
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:14.180
And together these restrictions on women's bodies produced kind of a largely in

149
00:09:14.181 --> 00:09:15.870
mobile citizen and capable.

150
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:20.990
It was seen as being able to do much physical or indeed mental economical kind

151
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.430
of political movement.
However,
by the 19th century plus the ninth century,

152
00:09:26.431 --> 00:09:27.660
things were really changing.

153
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:32.310
Women's rights activists were continuing to agitate for women's freedom of

154
00:09:32.311 --> 00:09:35.520
movement out of the home into education and business.

155
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.300
Public debate about the importance of exercise for women was actually changing.

156
00:09:39.301 --> 00:09:42.900
And doctors who had previously been very negative about it with suddenly coming

157
00:09:42.901 --> 00:09:46.680
out and cautiously recommending it.
Um,

158
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:51.710
and dress reform was emerging in the UK at for both sexes and the UK is rational

159
00:09:52.381 --> 00:09:56.730
dress society had been around since the 1880s now campaigning for what they

160
00:09:56.731 --> 00:09:59.280
called him irrational dress over,

161
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:04.600
I'm sorry for rational dress over irrational fashion and rational dress compares

162
00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:06.690
to have a whole range of different garments,

163
00:10:06.691 --> 00:10:10.940
but they're extensively recognized as a looser corset or no corseted,

164
00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:14.330
all m and a pair of bifurcated,
bifurcated,
um,

165
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:19.170
trousers such as bloomers and knickerbockers and no skirt or a shorter skirt.

166
00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:24.540
So shocking was this change in dress in public space that it really divided the

167
00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:25.374
nation.

168
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:29.160
Dress reform was incredibly controversial with many arguing that the public's

169
00:10:29.161 --> 00:10:32.550
distaste for this radical form of mask analyzed clothing for women,

170
00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:34.590
damaged women's freedom of movement,

171
00:10:34.591 --> 00:10:38.490
and it really split women's cyclists and dress reformers alike.

172
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:44.370
And it was also of course time of expanding popular media,
especially fueled,

173
00:10:44.371 --> 00:10:48.720
as I said by the popularity of cycling and lots of publications really targeted

174
00:10:48.721 --> 00:10:51.420
women as these new consumers of cycling.

175
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:55.620
And The lady cyclist was one such publication,
very popular at the time.

176
00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:58.800
It was launched in 1996 and it was edited by a man,

177
00:10:58.801 --> 00:11:01.050
but it had lots of contributions from women.

178
00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:05.430
And it put forward this really powerful new visual language and technological

179
00:11:05.431 --> 00:11:06.264
imaginary,

180
00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:10.470
the placed women firmly in cycling's fashionable set and carving a space for

181
00:11:10.471 --> 00:11:14.250
them in what had been pretty much a masculine kind of cycling world.

182
00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:17.730
So it was really important and the gave many of the permission to continue the

183
00:11:17.731 --> 00:11:21.240
sport or provide incentive for the tentative.
However,

184
00:11:21.241 --> 00:11:25.400
these publications also provide an awful lot of advice and um,

185
00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:30.480
and suggestions for the lady cyclist and what they should do or not do,

186
00:11:30.481 --> 00:11:32.280
what they should dress and not dress in.

187
00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:36.150
And they'll have regular columns such as why a lady's cyclists should always

188
00:11:36.151 --> 00:11:38.670
dress well cycling fashions.

189
00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:42.190
They're illustrations of the ideal lady cyclist.
Um,

190
00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:47.010
from the point of view of our various artists,
um,
as well as my favorite array,

191
00:11:47.011 --> 00:11:50.790
yourself becoming Lee.
And overall they were,

192
00:11:50.791 --> 00:11:55.750
it was really imperative that the lady cyclist appear feminine while Mobile,
um,

193
00:11:55.751 --> 00:12:00.580
with emphasis on being graceful and neat and sensible and becoming charming,

194
00:12:00.581 --> 00:12:02.470
dignified,
modest,
and more.

195
00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:06.980
So you note how this discourse is quite different from men and cycling's a

196
00:12:06.981 --> 00:12:07.814
discourse,

197
00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:12.580
but it sensibly though we're firmly discouraged not to show any effort or strain

198
00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:17.050
or cycling in order to maintain this kind of feminine form of Mobility.

199
00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.200
So it's quite a lot of pressure then to be a lady cyclists for any of us.

200
00:12:20.201 --> 00:12:22.050
You know what it's like to cycle.

201
00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:27.810
So another thing by portraits were really popular in the 1890s.

202
00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:32.470
It's kind of the equivalent of the selfie.
Now I imagine,
um,

203
00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:36.430
having access to all these new technologies such as the bicycle,

204
00:12:36.431 --> 00:12:38.020
a new cycle and garment,

205
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:41.500
and a camera illustrated great cultural cachet.

206
00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.330
And you've got to admit,

207
00:12:43.331 --> 00:12:48.070
Mrs Hh Timberlake here of Wigan is looking pretty elegant and dignified and

208
00:12:48.071 --> 00:12:50.320
modest and charming and very feminine there,

209
00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:55.240
but she's also wearing an awful lot of clothes and she's not moving

210
00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:59.860
because the reality is that,
um,

211
00:12:59.861 --> 00:13:03.970
it was actually quite difficult to look graceful and elegant and modest and,
um,

212
00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:09.040
graceful on a moving bicycle,
especially when you're wearing that many clothes.

213
00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.280
Um,
because that many clothes can make you fall off your bike.

214
00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:16.180
And it did because the reality of cycling in what was called ordinary dress was

215
00:13:16.181 --> 00:13:20.080
very difficult skirts and petticoats called in chain rings.
As you'd imagine,

216
00:13:20.081 --> 00:13:23.230
material wrapped around pedals flew into spokes.

217
00:13:23.231 --> 00:13:26.380
It even blew cause in some cases dresses for quite wide.

218
00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:30.510
It would even blew into wheels and blew up and even obscured cyclist view as

219
00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.340
some of the,
um,
newspaper reports would indicate.

220
00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:37.960
And newspapers also regularly noted with kind of gruesome detail,

221
00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:39.101
I'm a counsel,

222
00:13:39.101 --> 00:13:43.810
women dying or becoming disfigured as a result of cycling crashes often due to

223
00:13:43.811 --> 00:13:44.650
their clothing.

224
00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:48.940
And this discourse reinforced the idea that that many had that women weren't

225
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:50.980
natural cyclists.
Um,

226
00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:54.880
and they were kind of not very confident and a bit technologically and
competent.

227
00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:58.480
However,
it is very difficult to cycle wearing this many clothes,

228
00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.480
especially when I'm,
it keeps making you fall off.

229
00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:05.830
But the choice to cycling more appropriate cycle where such as more rational

230
00:14:05.831 --> 00:14:07.770
dress at the time,
um,

231
00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:11.650
wasn't necessarily socially safer cause cycling and more rational dress such as

232
00:14:11.651 --> 00:14:16.651
bloomers and more removing your skirt would expose you to the potential spectrum

233
00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:20.710
of responses from all classes of society.

234
00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:24.700
And it could result in verbal and even physical assault.
Um,

235
00:14:24.701 --> 00:14:26.470
cyclists were harassed in the street.

236
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.950
They'll subjected to rocks and sticks and incredibly rude remarks.

237
00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:33.800
There were denied entry into places and they'll gossiped about kind of imagine

238
00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:37.150
just kind of how difficult it would have been to kind of get out there and cycle

239
00:14:37.151 --> 00:14:39.430
when you knew that was going to happen in different places.

240
00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:46.810
So one of the reasons that women cyclists in cycle where elicited such responses

241
00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:50.740
is that they were seen by some to be encroaching and what had previously been

242
00:14:50.741 --> 00:14:55.180
men's lifestyles and privileges society feared women getting out alone.

243
00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:59.330
Unchaperoned moving at speed.
Um,
and,
um,

244
00:14:59.331 --> 00:15:00.740
in some cases even smoking,

245
00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:03.960
the fact that it would lead women into these potentially kind of,
um,

246
00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:08.980
bad behaviors and pursuit and lady cyclists were a favorite topic for discussion

247
00:15:10.611 --> 00:15:14.660
and debate in the media and lots of poems and diatribes and cartoons kind of

248
00:15:14.661 --> 00:15:19.070
really kind of use this in order to kind of generate discussion and debate and

249
00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:19.940
audiences.

250
00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.780
And I particularly love this image because she really doesn't look like she

251
00:15:23.781 --> 00:15:28.760
cares at all about it.
You know,
she's,
she's overdressed,

252
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:31.350
you know,
look at that broach on a head.
Um,

253
00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:33.890
she's not clearly very particularly good at cycling,
you know,

254
00:15:33.891 --> 00:15:37.700
to just run someone off the road.
Um,
she's unchaperoned,

255
00:15:37.701 --> 00:15:40.250
she's smoking and she's clearly a danger to others,

256
00:15:40.251 --> 00:15:43.450
but she's just keep on going with it.
Um,

257
00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.580
and clearly this cartoon is kind of mocking a lot of these fears,

258
00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:50.480
but most threatening to some parts of society was the fact that women were out

259
00:15:50.481 --> 00:15:53.660
there.
They were carving out new feminine modes and mobility.

260
00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:54.920
There were unchaperoned,

261
00:15:54.921 --> 00:15:57.860
they'll mimic it speed at different times and in different places than ever

262
00:15:57.861 --> 00:15:59.600
before.
And cycling,

263
00:15:59.601 --> 00:16:04.601
therefore for some was emblematic of women rejecting their natural roles at

264
00:16:05.391 --> 00:16:08.780
home.
Um,
caring and bearing of children,

265
00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:12.410
the carrying of bearing of others and their actions potentially threaten the

266
00:16:12.411 --> 00:16:15.080
very kind of continuously of humanity.

267
00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.540
This is how kind of intense the conversation was going.

268
00:16:17.541 --> 00:16:21.350
What's going to happen if women are out there cycling and not helping to produce

269
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:25.400
healthy offspring.
Um,
so it really polarized society,

270
00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.160
a female body on a bicycle,
how it moved,

271
00:16:28.161 --> 00:16:33.161
how it was dressed swiftly became a site of intense public debate about the

272
00:16:33.171 --> 00:16:36.230
broader role of women in society.
And as a result,

273
00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:39.830
you had to be quite brave in some places to get out there and go writing.

274
00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:45.260
However,
fortunately nothing was gonna stop quite a lot of women from cycling,

275
00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:49.970
um,
after that experience,
you know,
the unparalleled excitement of it.

276
00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.330
And there are many ways that women responded to what it become known as the

277
00:16:53.331 --> 00:16:54.200
dress problem.

278
00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:59.740
Some braved ordinary fashion on their bicycles and just suffered whatever kind

279
00:17:00.051 --> 00:17:01.160
of crushes might happen.

280
00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:06.020
Some war rational dress like kitty and her friends and brave the social

281
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:09.900
response,
some war.
Um,
some elicited sites,

282
00:17:09.901 --> 00:17:14.480
specific strategies which involved wearing more at one garment for city riding

283
00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:18.740
and then changing into something more appropriate for proper writing when nobody

284
00:17:18.741 --> 00:17:22.370
could really see you and others responded.
Um,

285
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:24.620
inventively through the dress itself.

286
00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:28.580
And this is what I've been particularly interested in and I don't know if anyone

287
00:17:28.581 --> 00:17:31.580
knows of Rosacea Parker's great book.
There's a burst of stitch.

288
00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:36.890
It relates to women's engagement in the art of embroidery,

289
00:17:36.891 --> 00:17:41.330
but I think it really relates to sewing as well because she says the art of

290
00:17:41.331 --> 00:17:44.930
embroidery has been the means of educating women into the Feminine Ideal and

291
00:17:44.931 --> 00:17:46.340
approving they've obtained it,

292
00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:50.400
but it has also provided a weapon of resistance to constraints of femininity.

293
00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:56.070
So what I discovered in doing quite a lot of archival research about this period

294
00:17:56.071 --> 00:18:00.840
of time is that quite a number of these pioneering women who really wanted to

295
00:18:00.841 --> 00:18:04.980
cycle,
um,
and wanted to respond through the dress itself,

296
00:18:04.981 --> 00:18:09.840
used all the tools and the skills and the networks at their disposal to redefine

297
00:18:09.841 --> 00:18:14.520
the primary parameters of femininity through their clothing.
So

298
00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:19.830
these challenges to women's freedom of movement created the conditions right for

299
00:18:19.831 --> 00:18:20.664
invention.

300
00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:25.770
And it turns out some of these pioneering women not only imagined designed,

301
00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:28.230
made and war radical new forms of cycle where,

302
00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:32.490
but they also patented their designs,
which is terrific for us.

303
00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:37.290
Um,
the mid 1890s is mark not only by a boom in cycling,

304
00:18:37.291 --> 00:18:40.170
but a boom in patenting as well.
Um,

305
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.170
I haven't got time to tell you about all the kinds of things that come together,

306
00:18:43.171 --> 00:18:45.000
but handle eats in the book.
Um,

307
00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.480
but there was a kind of a long history of patent reform that kind of slowly

308
00:18:48.481 --> 00:18:52.980
coincides with the reform to the marriage when women's property act that

309
00:18:52.981 --> 00:18:57.570
actually enabled them to have more control and power over their ideas.
Um,

310
00:18:57.930 --> 00:18:59.790
but it was a remarkable time for inventiveness,

311
00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:04.740
especially for and by women because cycling's dress problem was so mobilizing

312
00:19:04.741 --> 00:19:09.741
for women that psycho or inventions became a primary vehicle for women's entry

313
00:19:09.931 --> 00:19:11.100
into the world of patenting.

314
00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:13.350
They became statistically relevant for the first time.

315
00:19:13.351 --> 00:19:15.060
So they get talked about in new ways.

316
00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:20.070
So what a patents have many,
have you done patent recent?

317
00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:25.410
No,
me neither until this project to a what?
A patents.

318
00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:30.120
A patent is a temporary monopoly on the economic benefit that can be derived

319
00:19:30.121 --> 00:19:33.990
from an invention.
As such,
a pattern turns an idea until a form of property.

320
00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:35.460
The person who has a new idea,

321
00:19:35.461 --> 00:19:40.200
a patent asserts can own it in the same way that he or she can own land or
money.

322
00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:46.320
Okay.
But why are patents interesting to sociologists and to you?

323
00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:50.310
Well,
patterns,
uh,

324
00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:54.930
provide an incredible material history of invention.
Um,

325
00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:57.860
as Ruth Schwartz Cohen Rights,
if there's no such thing as a patent,

326
00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:01.320
we would not know very much about inventors and patterns.

327
00:20:01.321 --> 00:20:05.730
I think a fascinating design objects because inventors describing detail the

328
00:20:05.731 --> 00:20:08.760
problem they're attempting to solve.
And in doing so,

329
00:20:08.761 --> 00:20:12.180
provide us with a glimpse of the socio,
cultural context of the time.

330
00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:16.860
The inventor tells them us about themselves,
their name,
address,
self identified,

331
00:20:16.861 --> 00:20:21.630
vocation.
They're married status mostly for women.
They identify the problem,

332
00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:26.280
then they tell us how they've solved it and they go into great detail about who

333
00:20:26.281 --> 00:20:29.820
it's for,
what materials,
what technologies,
um,

334
00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:33.430
how it relates to past inventions.
Um,

335
00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:36.900
and the many ways that it can be put to use patterns.

336
00:20:36.901 --> 00:20:40.530
We're also particularly good record of women's inventiveness.
Um,

337
00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:42.270
as Zarina Khan says,

338
00:20:42.271 --> 00:20:45.210
pattern records are inherently useful in this regard because they provide a

339
00:20:45.211 --> 00:20:48.940
continuous source of information about market related activities of women.

340
00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:54.250
So they're an amazing resource of firsthand accounts of women from this period.

341
00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:57.700
They give voice to a group.
They're very often silenced by history.

342
00:20:57.701 --> 00:21:01.720
We don't often hear much about them and they're also a continuous valuable

343
00:21:01.721 --> 00:21:02.411
record.
You know,

344
00:21:02.411 --> 00:21:07.060
they provide evidence of women as being creative inventors and continually

345
00:21:07.061 --> 00:21:09.580
contributing to cycling's history.
You know,

346
00:21:09.581 --> 00:21:12.010
when we often look at more conventional records,

347
00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:16.510
women tend to pop up in the account.
This shows us that there were continually,

348
00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:21.600
there's an evolving in connected history of their contributions and they present

349
00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.050
a range of voices,

350
00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:27.310
not just in a way try and full loud or more traditionally heroic kind of stories

351
00:21:27.311 --> 00:21:28.990
that are conventionally successful.

352
00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:34.420
Pattern databases record the work of all the ideas that go into the archive.

353
00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:38.210
Uh,
regardless of whether or not they've actually been successfully taken out and

354
00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:39.610
produced into something.

355
00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:43.660
So there's still an incredibly useful body of data because it shows us what

356
00:21:43.661 --> 00:21:47.200
people were thinking about and how they were drawing on the past to claim the

357
00:21:47.201 --> 00:21:51.100
present and imagine different futures.
Um,

358
00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:54.150
and they speak to future makers and users,
you know,

359
00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:58.870
but they provide detailed instructions for somebody else and they provide all

360
00:21:58.871 --> 00:22:02.140
that detail for somebody else to remake the invention.

361
00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:06.010
So a little bit more on that in a second,
and they're not boring.

362
00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:08.770
Um,
to be honest,

363
00:22:08.771 --> 00:22:11.860
I was a bit concerned doing this much kind of patent research and hauling away

364
00:22:11.861 --> 00:22:13.610
and kind of archives.
Um,

365
00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:17.230
for a number of years it turned out because I'm more of an ethnographer,

366
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:21.130
I would spend time with people actually going and living with different

367
00:22:21.131 --> 00:22:25.750
communities,
um,
doing lots of field work,
um,
and interviewing people,

368
00:22:25.751 --> 00:22:29.890
hanging out with people,
um,
building things.
It was quite lively and dynamic,

369
00:22:29.891 --> 00:22:33.650
hang around with people who are alive.
So,
um,
eh,

370
00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:36.940
it was a little bit concerned doing all of this as to whether it would be as

371
00:22:36.941 --> 00:22:40.090
interesting as it turned out to be.
But it turns out the,

372
00:22:40.091 --> 00:22:45.000
a story of Victorian inventors and patentees is far from a kind of dry and Dell

373
00:22:45.001 --> 00:22:45.401
account,

374
00:22:45.401 --> 00:22:49.990
relegated to the dusty corners of archives combined with geological research.

375
00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:53.950
The race to patent ideas at the turn of last century is full of drama and

376
00:22:53.951 --> 00:22:56.660
excitement and successful inventors were,

377
00:22:56.661 --> 00:22:59.020
as Ruth Schwartz Cohen talks about,

378
00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:02.680
they'll celebrate it in print and from the pulpit household names either in

379
00:23:02.681 --> 00:23:05.680
their own right or because of the names of the companies they founded.

380
00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:08.170
Newspapers quoted them,
popular magazines,

381
00:23:08.171 --> 00:23:11.620
recounted the exploits and huge crowds turned out to hear about them.

382
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:12.670
It really was,

383
00:23:12.671 --> 00:23:17.320
I think in the 1890s the equivalent of kind of the early.com boom or the turn of

384
00:23:17.321 --> 00:23:18.250
the last century.

385
00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:22.570
Lots of people were so excited by this potential of an idea could radically

386
00:23:22.571 --> 00:23:24.730
change your future,

387
00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:28.480
could really propel your sort of social mobility in ways that other kinds of

388
00:23:28.481 --> 00:23:32.200
jobs or opportunities couldn't.
So,

389
00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:36.190
and also look at the books.
I get to hang out with are enormous.

390
00:23:36.191 --> 00:23:40.180
I should have had my hand in there for scale,
but they really were huge.
And uh,

391
00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:43.840
invariably,
you know,
they're filled with all the dust of 1890s.

392
00:23:43.841 --> 00:23:47.300
I would leave kind of wearing and bodied with kind of materiality.

393
00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:50.120
And I see you're probably leaving some of myself in it as well.

394
00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:51.470
That's another talk.

395
00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:56.300
But I've been particularly influenced by feminist turn it in the archives to see

396
00:23:56.301 --> 00:24:00.170
not only what is present in the archives but also what is absent and kind of

397
00:24:00.171 --> 00:24:04.760
critically consider the politics that shape collections.
So as an installer,

398
00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:05.721
you know,
it was written,

399
00:24:05.721 --> 00:24:10.070
this involves a move from the archive as a source to archive as a subject.

400
00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:14.030
And she talks about our carving is a process and thinking about it as a thing.

401
00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:18.320
And likewise Kate icons work is really interesting about archives because she

402
00:24:18.321 --> 00:24:20.270
says it's not so much a turn to the past,

403
00:24:20.271 --> 00:24:22.130
but another way to understand the present.

404
00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:26.750
So I began to see these kind of spaces and materials as opportunities to find to

405
00:24:26.751 --> 00:24:28.550
piece together these stories.

406
00:24:28.551 --> 00:24:31.100
Cause it's certainly not sitting there waiting to just read them.

407
00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:34.160
Particularly Women's stories in the past.
They're kind of everywhere.

408
00:24:34.161 --> 00:24:37.490
The fragmented,
it's a way of trying to piece these pieces together,

409
00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:42.700
but also trying to resist making it a smooth narrative because I don't know for

410
00:24:42.981 --> 00:24:46.840
sure.
So I'm trying to piece them together but still maintain kind of an opens

411
00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:49.880
opportunity for other people to interpret it.
This material.

412
00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:53.000
So what were they inventing?

413
00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:58.550
Looking across these patents?

414
00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:01.850
Essential aim becomes clear and it's quite ambitious.

415
00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:07.060
They aim to create garments that did two things that operated as a form of

416
00:25:07.061 --> 00:25:11.480
successful form of cycle where while still giving the appearance of an ordinary

417
00:25:11.481 --> 00:25:14.780
skirt.
So they're trying to make something that does both things.

418
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:18.350
And you can see this is just a few cutouts for a number of different patterns.

419
00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:21.320
You know,
it will have the parents of an ordinary is walking skirt.

420
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:24.650
My invention relates to improvements and lady skirts that were rendered them

421
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:28.460
equally adaptable for cyclists and be indistinguishable.

422
00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:33.740
They're trying to really ambitiously do two things in one and there are a number

423
00:25:33.741 --> 00:25:37.400
of ways that they did this.
And I've identified five themes.

424
00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:39.120
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

425
00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:42.390
<v 0>Inventive solution number one.
Um,</v>

426
00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:44.370
attach women to their clothing.

427
00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:50.390
A inventors used a whole array of straps and buckles and even metal belts and a

428
00:25:50.731 --> 00:25:53.430
whole range of,
of chains as well.
Um,
uh,

429
00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:56.790
to prevent a skirt from flapping and flying about which was the problem.

430
00:25:57.210 --> 00:25:59.970
And funny enough,
more male inventors thought this was a better idea.

431
00:25:59.971 --> 00:26:01.290
And then the female inventors,

432
00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:05.580
women were more about taking the stuff away rather than adding more things on

433
00:26:05.581 --> 00:26:06.414
there.

434
00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:08.020
<v 1>Okay.</v>

435
00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:11.830
<v 0>Inventive solution number two,
uh,
tailor the scope to fit the bike.</v>

436
00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:16.240
So this cuts some of the bulk of the skirt and the kind of layers of petticoats

437
00:26:16.241 --> 00:26:17.380
which were flapping around.

438
00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:21.100
And the aim was to fit the skirt over both sides of the back wheel without going

439
00:26:21.101 --> 00:26:23.470
into it,
which is what this image is showing there.

440
00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:25.330
But when you moved away from your bicycle,

441
00:26:25.331 --> 00:26:28.480
it was indiscernible that you were wearing cycle where,

442
00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:31.390
so at limited some of the potential for crashes,

443
00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:34.780
but the scope was still flapping quite close to that back wheel.

444
00:26:34.781 --> 00:26:38.470
And there are a lot of critics of this particular invention.

445
00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:43.150
Inventive solution number three is what I call builtin.

446
00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:47.340
So you might love your bloomers,
it might be hurricane on them,

447
00:26:47.341 --> 00:26:49.260
but maybe you didn't want anyone else to see them.

448
00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:53.820
So I'm perhaps you were committed to rational dress and women's suffrage,

449
00:26:53.821 --> 00:26:57.300
but you weren't so keen and having things thrown at you in public.
Um,

450
00:26:57.301 --> 00:26:59.880
so you wore them but you kept them hidden by a skirt.

451
00:26:59.881 --> 00:27:03.690
So there are a number of different ideas that had bloom is sewn into them,

452
00:27:03.691 --> 00:27:07.830
replacing the petticoats or re re removed a lot of those layers.

453
00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:12.720
And if your scope did fly out,
then you'll still kind of cupboard
inventive.

454
00:27:12.721 --> 00:27:16.110
Solution number four is what I technically call the really big bloomers.

455
00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:22.500
Um,
they look like a skirt.
They're so big as you can see,

456
00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:27.180
kind of hid the fact that you've got bifurcation going on there.
Um,

457
00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:31.620
and he drew independently moving legs to a degree but still freed your legs to

458
00:27:31.621 --> 00:27:36.360
pedal and kept the loose material in check.
And,
um,

459
00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:39.810
I really like these and I've made a number of pairs of these and they're

460
00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:42.810
phenomenal for snacks and cyclists,
really like their snacks.

461
00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:45.990
You can get a lot of pockets happening in there with a lot of lot of food

462
00:27:45.991 --> 00:27:50.850
without anyone knowing.
Inventive solution number five,

463
00:27:50.851 --> 00:27:52.680
convertible costumes.

464
00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:58.110
Now these game garments really ambitiously aimed for both respectable fashion,

465
00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:03.200
urban street wear and cycle where so the inventors engineer deliberately conceal

466
00:28:03.541 --> 00:28:08.250
technological systems into their skirt.
So into their skirts,

467
00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:13.290
I'm using police systems and gathering devices and cords and buttons and loops

468
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:18.010
and other mechanisms into the seams and hems and waistbands that enabled with

469
00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:20.840
whereas the secretly switch from modal,
uh,

470
00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:25.770
identities from per ambulant walking to cycling,
um,
when they need it.

471
00:28:25.771 --> 00:28:26.820
And this is the theme I was,

472
00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:30.390
became very struck by and more women than men really took to this.

473
00:28:30.391 --> 00:28:35.130
And this was the biggest theme out of all of those.
So what do we do next?

474
00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:38.340
Um,
I really want to see these things in action.
Like how do they work?

475
00:28:38.341 --> 00:28:41.250
How were they made?
How were they repaired?
Did they work at all?

476
00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:43.410
So I'd been around,
um,

477
00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:47.460
so many of the museums and galleries in the UK looking at Victorian sportswear

478
00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:50.160
and I don't know if anyone's done this,
but it's amazing.

479
00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:54.540
You go into museums and galleries and they have such an amazing collection of

480
00:28:54.541 --> 00:28:58.950
Victorian garments as well as other things and curators are really keen to bring

481
00:28:58.951 --> 00:29:02.410
them up out of the archive because they're not all on show and to um,

482
00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:06.750
provide them to you to explore and engage with.
Um,

483
00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:08.310
and there's lots,
there's,

484
00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:12.030
for me there was yachting and horse riding and gymnastics and swimming and

485
00:29:12.031 --> 00:29:16.110
golfing and walking and all sorts of things,
but no cycle,
um,

486
00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:20.580
convertible cycle outfits.
Um,
so I haven't found it yet.

487
00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:21.690
Any evidence of these,

488
00:29:21.691 --> 00:29:25.320
even though I will show an example to show very clearly that quite a number of

489
00:29:25.321 --> 00:29:28.740
them were made successful and distributed and worn by people.

490
00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:33.150
So why aren't they available considering lots of other things are,

491
00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.690
well,
you talked to correct curators and think about this for awhile.

492
00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:38.100
Cycleway gets worn out.

493
00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:42.010
I don't know how many of you think about your old cycling next and think the

494
00:29:42.011 --> 00:29:45.170
National Gallery needs them.
Probably not.
Um,

495
00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:49.540
so inventions also were hidden in plain sight.

496
00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.400
One of the kinds of purposes of them was that no,

497
00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:55.150
no one knew about it unless you were transforming them.
So it's um,

498
00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:57.490
they're designed not to be seen and quite possibly,

499
00:29:57.491 --> 00:29:59.890
if you don't know what you're looking for when you just get one of these skirts,

500
00:29:59.891 --> 00:30:02.170
you may not know that these things are built into them.

501
00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:06.460
And of course women's invention in the past not necessarily recognized or highly

502
00:30:06.461 --> 00:30:11.170
valued for what it is.
Um,
and as per agenda conventions of the time,
you know,

503
00:30:11.171 --> 00:30:14.140
either ignored or slowly written out of history as well.

504
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:19.210
And even if they were available.
Um,
these garments are really made for mobility.

505
00:30:19.211 --> 00:30:22.720
They're live dynamic,
you know,
transformable convertible objects.

506
00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:24.760
It's really hard to gain insights from them,

507
00:30:24.761 --> 00:30:27.760
even though it's amazing when you go in,
this is kind of what you get.

508
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000
You get the object,
you get these tools of investigation being,
um,

509
00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:35.530
a tape measure pencil,
some paper,
a magnifying glass,

510
00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:37.150
and that's how you interview costumes.

511
00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:40.390
And it's interesting the cannabis recalcitrants as human interviewees,

512
00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:43.720
they'll tell you some things and you know,
keep other things to themselves.

513
00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.450
But even if I had these costumes,
um,

514
00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:50.470
as I came to understand a lot of these really only makes sense on and with the

515
00:30:50.471 --> 00:30:54.250
body,
they're hard to understand off the body.
Um,

516
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:56.260
and understandably,
you know,

517
00:30:56.261 --> 00:30:58.570
the curators probably wouldn't have let me put them on,

518
00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:01.450
convert them and go for a bike ride.
And frankly,
these are so small,

519
00:31:01.451 --> 00:31:03.680
this body was not going to fit into them.
And I'm calm.

520
00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:06.700
I'm committed to this project,
but I've hadn't been wearing a corset for it.

521
00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:10.420
So after doing a lot of this research,
um,

522
00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:14.650
and finding no evidence of the material,
material garments,

523
00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:19.600
um,
we figured we had the instructions in the patents.

524
00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:23.480
We have the step by step detailed,
um,

525
00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:27.970
provisions by the research,
the inventors themselves.
We should make some.

526
00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:32.740
So I'm,
I'd been working with a team of a pattern cutter,

527
00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:35.980
a weaver and an artist to remake a collection of these.

528
00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.630
And I've been calling this,

529
00:31:37.631 --> 00:31:41.020
I'm making things to make sense of things along the way.

530
00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:45.100
And it builds on a long history as you probably know in science and the history

531
00:31:45.101 --> 00:31:47.710
of technology for reproductions and,
um,

532
00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:51.970
replications where you explore through practice are the forms are kind of

533
00:31:51.971 --> 00:31:54.160
sensory and bodily knowledge and asked,
you know,

534
00:31:54.161 --> 00:31:57.310
what can you learn from doing this that you wouldn't just get from doing textual

535
00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:58.660
analysis of a patent.

536
00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:02.890
And Patents provide really rich instruction for it because the nature of pattern

537
00:32:02.891 --> 00:32:05.230
is such that the language and drawings must provide full,

538
00:32:05.231 --> 00:32:06.620
clear an exact description.

539
00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:10.900
Interventions such as well enable others skilled in the art which are pertains

540
00:32:10.901 --> 00:32:14.320
to make use of it.
So in the case of,
uh,
clothing,
patent,

541
00:32:14.321 --> 00:32:19.150
anyone knowledgeable in the art of sewing should be able to reproduce these.
Um,

542
00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:23.980
and we also argued that making these kinds of credit relationship with people

543
00:32:23.981 --> 00:32:27.860
who'd lived to 130 years before we got into this dialogue,
you know,

544
00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:33.180
with the inventors through their inventions and conducted an ethnography of

545
00:32:33.191 --> 00:32:34.180
making along the way.

546
00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:38.110
And it got incredibly messy because I'm a sociologist so I don't get a lot of

547
00:32:38.111 --> 00:32:41.240
studio space and this is quite a big sociology office bills,

548
00:32:41.241 --> 00:32:45.290
a lot of floor work going on here.
Um,
so I stuck a camera to the ceiling.

549
00:32:45.291 --> 00:32:48.560
I go pro and took photographs every 10 seconds for the last six weeks of the

550
00:32:48.561 --> 00:32:51.740
project.
You can imagine how much data I have from this.
Um,

551
00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:54.470
and may timelapse films,
which I don't have one to show you,

552
00:32:54.471 --> 00:32:55.550
but they're on my website.

553
00:32:55.790 --> 00:33:00.350
And just the amount of movement and dynamism capture from that perspective

554
00:33:00.351 --> 00:33:03.530
became another form of data as well as kind of doing field notes.

555
00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:09.080
So we made a collection of five of these garments.
Um,

556
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:10.760
I said I would make five skirts,

557
00:33:10.761 --> 00:33:12.800
but it really doesn't make sense if you don't make the whole thing.

558
00:33:12.801 --> 00:33:17.660
So ended up making about 27 pieces of clothing as well as all the iterations

559
00:33:17.661 --> 00:33:21.350
because trying to work out how to build things like police systems into skirts,

560
00:33:21.690 --> 00:33:25.520
it turns out you need to do a few iterations of different scales to even work

561
00:33:25.521 --> 00:33:27.530
out what that is.
Cause I don't know about you,

562
00:33:27.531 --> 00:33:31.700
but I've never seen a police system in the skirt before this project.
Um,

563
00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:35.030
so I'm actually wearing one of the convertible costumes now.

564
00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:39.650
I'm not normally dress like this.
Um,
so I can introduce it to you.

565
00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:41.640
Good.
Um,

566
00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:46.690
I am wearing a patented convertible Victorian cycling costume that was,

567
00:33:49.431 --> 00:33:51.770
um,
designed by Alice by grave,

568
00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:54.770
a dressmaker of Brixton in 1895.

569
00:33:55.010 --> 00:34:00.010
She was 35 years old when she lodged her UK patent for improvements in ladies

570
00:34:00.561 --> 00:34:05.390
cycling skirts and the aim of the design.
Um,
I literally,

571
00:34:05.391 --> 00:34:08.540
one thing,
if you've ever patented or know about patenting,

572
00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:10.670
you'll be amazed at how quick this is.

573
00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:14.420
The complete specification was left on the 1st of November,

574
00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:17.450
1895 and it was accepted on the 6th of December,
1895.

575
00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:21.530
I don't think that happens anymore.
It's quite exciting.
Um,

576
00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:25.850
the aim of her design was to provide a skirt,
um,

577
00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:30.680
that was proper for where we're neither on or off the machine.

578
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:34.910
So she's trying to this ambitious thing look like you're in reputable and

579
00:34:34.911 --> 00:34:38.180
respectable streetwear and then converted into cycle,

580
00:34:38.181 --> 00:34:39.980
were unable to convert it back again.

581
00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:44.540
So she clearly knew she was onto something cause she went on to patent it in

582
00:34:44.541 --> 00:34:47.570
three other countries.
She patented it in,
um,

583
00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:50.660
Switzerland in Canada and in the US.

584
00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:52.153
<v 2>MMM.</v>

585
00:34:53.490 --> 00:34:57.690
<v 0>And a common difficulty when doing kind of patents studies is losing the trail.</v>

586
00:34:58.630 --> 00:34:59.940
<v 2>Um,
really quickly.</v>

587
00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:06.850
<v 0>Um,
often the inventors named get lost when a commercial organization picks up an</v>

588
00:35:06.851 --> 00:35:08.800
idea when they renamed it and distributed.

589
00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:12.460
This didn't happen with Alice by grave.
Um,
Yoga,

590
00:35:12.490 --> 00:35:15.580
the British fashion house picked up this patent.

591
00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:18.570
Clearly I recognize the value of it and,
um,

592
00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:21.400
proceeded to distribute the design under her name,

593
00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:24.880
the biograph convertible skirt,
which is obviously really good for us.

594
00:35:24.881 --> 00:35:25.810
And tracing this.

595
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:30.610
And as an editorial in popular cycling magazines and newspapers and periodicals

596
00:35:30.611 --> 00:35:34.900
started to appear.
Um,

597
00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:36.760
the microwave of convertible skirt was quite a,

598
00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:40.500
it captured the nation's imagination.
It was regulated,

599
00:35:40.501 --> 00:35:44.760
demonstrated at all the big cycling shows,
lots of reviews were written about it,

600
00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:48.780
um,
uh,
in not only the cycling kind of magazines,

601
00:35:48.781 --> 00:35:52.110
but also in much kind of bigger,
broader kind of newspapers.

602
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:54.810
And it started to be distributed all around the UK.

603
00:35:54.811 --> 00:35:58.620
And this is an example of one of 'em Yeager's distributors that really kind of

604
00:35:58.621 --> 00:36:01.850
drives this forward,
you know,
the new bigroad convertible skirt,
you know,

605
00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:06.750
and suitable for cycling,
et Cetera.
And,
um,

606
00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:11.190
it was written about in us media because he traveled over there in order to

607
00:36:11.191 --> 00:36:14.970
lodge your patent and do new deals.
Um,
so she,
um,

608
00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:19.560
here it is in the San Francisco Chronicle and then Saint Louis,
um,
times,

609
00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:24.770
um,
and it even wound its way to Australia.
Uh,

610
00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:29.370
there's distributed from Yag by Yeager and it was sold in David Jones.

611
00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:32.820
If people know it's a big retailer that's still around today and it was

612
00:36:32.821 --> 00:36:34.590
available in Sydney and in Melbourne.

613
00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:37.620
And again was talked about and lots of newspapers around the place.

614
00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:40.870
So this is an example of not all patents,
you know,

615
00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:45.870
clearly leave the patent archive,
but some of them did.
And this very much did.

616
00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:50.760
So before I show you the invention a little bit more about her family's

617
00:36:50.761 --> 00:36:54.790
influences to kind of understand how she got to what she got to.
Um,

618
00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:58.950
her mother was a dressmaker and so as Alice by grave,
she self identifies as one.

619
00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:03.720
Um,
her parents had a watching clock making shop,
um,
in Chelsea,

620
00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:08.310
a king's road and her brother and sister in law were professional cyclists.

621
00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:13.860
So watching clock making a bit of sewing,
cycling coming together.

622
00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:19.140
So what did she design?
This is one of her drawings.

623
00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:23.690
So,
um,
she's gotta be wearing a Corset,

624
00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:27.790
but you think when we get the size of that waste versus their shoulders,
um,

625
00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:31.260
anyway,
so he seems to be kind of holding onto her waist in some formation.

626
00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:32.460
There's something going on there.

627
00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:35.850
So this is what you'd look like as you were walking along the street,
you know,

628
00:37:35.851 --> 00:37:37.380
and not looking like a cyclist.

629
00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:40.350
You get to your bicycle and then you do this to it.

630
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:45.750
So you leave your bicycle,
you look like that,
you do this.

631
00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:47.310
So what she's effectively done,

632
00:37:47.311 --> 00:37:49.440
and I'll move around the front now so you can see,

633
00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:53.040
she's got effectively a very simple a line skirt that otherwise you wouldn't

634
00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:54.330
guess that I was a cyclist,

635
00:37:54.570 --> 00:37:59.310
but then hidden at the waistband or a series of chords that she has in button

636
00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:02.730
holes that don't have any buttons that says part of a system.
Um,

637
00:38:02.731 --> 00:38:06.090
and you would rush up the front like a curtain.

638
00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:10.190
We were starting to call this a skirt and being a kid and,

639
00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:15.210
and you would tie it at the waist.
She actually had a much cleverer design,
um,

640
00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:18.960
cleaning than what we've done with this because I'd broken this several times.

641
00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:21.690
Um,
it adds a new level of,
um,

642
00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:26.390
potential malfunction to a talk when you can ruin your dress as well as your

643
00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:27.630
PowerPoint.
Um,

644
00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:33.830
and then usefully she has a series of police at the back as well that she's,

645
00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:37.420
as you can see,
I've got different,
um,
that she's looped through to the front.

646
00:38:37.421 --> 00:38:38.680
So you're not fattening at the back.

647
00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:43.860
You would grab this and then you would rush up the back as well and tie this

648
00:38:44.201 --> 00:38:48.190
off.
So then suddenly you've,
um,
revealed some of your bloomers,

649
00:38:48.191 --> 00:38:49.270
but not too much of them.

650
00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:52.210
And I actually cycled here today cause I don't live very far away and I wasn't

651
00:38:52.211 --> 00:38:56.440
going to them change that we might be quicker and it really does work.

652
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:59.740
And you were tied them off and hide them.

653
00:38:59.741 --> 00:39:03.370
And then she talked about how it was still kind of an attractive skirt,
you know,

654
00:39:03.371 --> 00:39:06.160
still festoons she called it over the hips,
which to be honest,

655
00:39:06.161 --> 00:39:10.660
I didn't know what that meant until I started to festoon over the hips.
Um,

656
00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:12.100
so incredibly kind of useful.

657
00:39:12.101 --> 00:39:14.920
But the nice thing then about it is that you would then,

658
00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:18.580
if once you've got a few bike,
it's called the quick change convertible skirt.

659
00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:21.070
You would undo your knots

660
00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:27.160
and then drop it straight back down again and then it would just hide.

661
00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:29.133
So,

662
00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:37.350
and I think what this research really highlights,
um,

663
00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:40.780
is the role of women as,
um,

664
00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:46.260
as engineers and as designers and as kind of feminist inventors.

665
00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:50.740
You know,
these stories really add new layers and textures to cycling history.

666
00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:53.740
They depict women as critically engaged,
creative citizens,

667
00:39:53.830 --> 00:39:56.620
actively driving social and technical change.

668
00:39:57.010 --> 00:39:59.650
And this is really important because with few exceptions,

669
00:39:59.950 --> 00:40:03.610
women are mostly framed as being kind of passive or ornamental.

670
00:40:03.611 --> 00:40:06.970
Bystanders caught up in waves of technical change,

671
00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:11.310
symbols of social upheaval,
not catalysts of it.
Um,

672
00:40:11.311 --> 00:40:12.730
and so what this research does,

673
00:40:12.731 --> 00:40:17.110
it sits in the context of kind of feminist reclamation projects,

674
00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:18.760
um,
because it brings to light,

675
00:40:18.761 --> 00:40:22.180
it's accounts of women's engagements with cycling that demonstrate that weren't

676
00:40:22.181 --> 00:40:23.530
just located on the,
you know,

677
00:40:23.531 --> 00:40:27.490
as bystanders but actually actively engaged trying to make change.

678
00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:32.770
And in claiming they're doing this by putting their radically kind of different

679
00:40:32.771 --> 00:40:34.600
clad bodies add in public space,

680
00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:38.380
but also claiming their ideas through patenting was not only a practical way of

681
00:40:38.381 --> 00:40:40.000
sharing and distributing the ideas,

682
00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:44.380
but it was also a political act because they were carving out new space on the

683
00:40:44.381 --> 00:40:47.140
road.
And also in legal and economic worlds.
You know,

684
00:40:47.141 --> 00:40:50.380
there were being talked about in this whole new world of invention,

685
00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:55.650
the annual patent controller reports sounded a little bit surprised every year

686
00:40:55.931 --> 00:41:00.070
when they would talk about the statistics of women's inventiveness cause it was

687
00:41:00.071 --> 00:41:04.660
new in the 1890s.
So,
and also cycle where,
you know,

688
00:41:04.661 --> 00:41:07.750
as I went into this project to ask,
you know,
how,
how a cycle where mattered,

689
00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:10.540
it's always mattered.
It mattered right from the beginning.

690
00:41:10.541 --> 00:41:12.190
And it comes still matters today.

691
00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:16.660
And although society's changed dramatically over the last two centuries,

692
00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:21.400
many of the issues that marginalized women and in inhibited their cycling uptake

693
00:41:21.401 --> 00:41:24.850
remain remarkably kind of familiar,
um,

694
00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:29.080
such as the assumption that kind of physical exertion is incompatible with

695
00:41:29.081 --> 00:41:33.740
femininity and how women are still disproportionately kind of harassed in public

696
00:41:33.741 --> 00:41:37.430
space often in relation to what they were.
These issues are not new,

697
00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:43.120
but women have always creatively and critically responded to these challenges in

698
00:41:43.281 --> 00:41:45.730
order to do the things that they want to do in spite of some.

699
00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:48.720
So why don't we know what,

700
00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:52.240
why do we know so little about these kinds of inventions?
You know,
um,

701
00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:55.520
who else and what else don't we know about is the questions of this kept on

702
00:41:55.521 --> 00:41:58.310
coming out while I was doing this kind of stuff.
Um,

703
00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:01.040
how many other amazing ideas are kind of out there,

704
00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:05.030
either hidden or undervalued or kind of erased from our histories?

705
00:42:05.570 --> 00:42:08.380
How do we seek out other ideas like this or,

706
00:42:08.381 --> 00:42:11.030
or listen to other kinds of silenced voices?

707
00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:16.520
What else could we know?
And I just want to leave with a question you'll,

708
00:42:16.521 --> 00:42:20.180
if you learn more about a wider range of inventors and inventions,

709
00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:24.670
might it change how we think about and inhabit the present and,

710
00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:27.800
and how would it help us kind of imagine and make different futures?

711
00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:30.170
And I'll finish there.
Thank you very much.
