1
00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.460
Everybody.
Uh,
thanks for having me here.
I just want to say first of all,
uh,

2
00:00:10.461 --> 00:00:12.080
I'm truly honored to be here.

3
00:00:12.081 --> 00:00:15.320
This is a really cool to talk to somebody awesome smart people,

4
00:00:15.321 --> 00:00:19.420
and it'd be at a company that I've watched,
um,
you know,
uh,

5
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.970
as a fan almost my whole adult life,
so I just really appreciate it.

6
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:24.800
My name is Aaron [inaudible].

7
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.330
I'm the founder of leaf technologies and I'm absolutely obsessed with

8
00:00:29.331 --> 00:00:30.164
snowboarding.

9
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.480
There's just something about that movement and that feeling of snowboarding

10
00:00:35.481 --> 00:00:40.481
that's just incredible and it's so incredible that you've got 39 million people

11
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.810
around the world spending $2 billion a year to enjoy it for only five days a

12
00:00:48.201 --> 00:00:51.140
year on average,
just five days a year.

13
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.660
Would you play basketball five days a year or soccer or anything else for just

14
00:00:56.661 --> 00:01:01.220
five days a year maybe.
But snowboarding,
it's really,
is that incredible?

15
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.120
It's that worth it.

16
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.950
But obviously we have a lot of the year we're on the sidelines just hanging out.

17
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.900
Now I know a lot of you might not be snowboarders.
So what I'm about to show you,

18
00:01:11.901 --> 00:01:15.020
you might not grasp the full reality,
the full gravity of that.

19
00:01:15.021 --> 00:01:19.160
So if you could just for a moment think about something that,
uh,
is a,

20
00:01:19.161 --> 00:01:23.570
an activity that you can only enjoy five days a year.
Maybe it's traveling,

21
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.400
uh,
like a fishing trip maybe,
or climbing a mountain.
Think about,

22
00:01:28.401 --> 00:01:32.900
think about that experience for a second and in those feelings that you have

23
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:33.860
enjoying this.

24
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.160
And now imagine if somebody told you you can enjoy this experience and have

25
00:01:40.161 --> 00:01:45.161
these feelings on demand anywhere in the world after work on the weekends,

26
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.300
whenever you want.
That's basically what we've done for snowboarders.
And so,

27
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.710
uh,
what is it about snowboarding that makes it so incredible?

28
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.790
And it's,

29
00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.950
it's a combination of speed and turning and carving,

30
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.570
which is,
uh,
you know,
leaning into your,
your,
your carbs,
your turns rather.

31
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.060
But it's,
it's this control drift.
I think that is really that,

32
00:02:10.061 --> 00:02:14.660
that addicting part and the drift.
It's,
it's something that,
you know,

33
00:02:14.661 --> 00:02:19.330
from the first time you ran and slid across your kitchen floor or drifted out

34
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.660
the back tire of your bike or your scooters,
a kid or you know,

35
00:02:23.661 --> 00:02:26.480
doing donuts around your high school parking lot.
It's,

36
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.430
there's something just addicting about that.

37
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.800
And snowboarding is really unique because it takes that drift and put you in

38
00:02:33.801 --> 00:02:34.730
total control.

39
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.840
And so you can spin and you can slide and there's really just nothing else like

40
00:02:38.841 --> 00:02:43.760
it.
And uh,
and so,
so that is just,
just so unique to snowboarding.

41
00:02:43.761 --> 00:02:45.920
It's something that has just never existed anywhere else.

42
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.700
Another great thing about snowboarding is that community aspect.

43
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.820
So sharing this adrenaline with your friends and uh,
and,

44
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.540
and going on and snowboarding with them.
And sometimes,
you know,

45
00:02:56.541 --> 00:02:59.060
given that snowboarding is just a five day a year experience,

46
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.450
you might only see these friends five days a year,

47
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.950
or at least just enjoying this,
this experience with them for only five days.

48
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.020
And so all of these things together,

49
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.500
sobering can be a little bit of a frustrating sport most of the year.

50
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.140
And so that's what we set out to change.

51
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.180
And we are a group of snowboarders that all share that dream of writing all year

52
00:03:19.181 --> 00:03:20.014
round.

53
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.910
And I can tell you getting to that point where we can enjoy this sport all year

54
00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.520
round as a snowboarder,
it's,
it really is a dream come true.

55
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.310
And so what does it look like?
It's Kinda hard to describe in words.

56
00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.700
Somebody actually IX snowboarding and Dubai are around the world.

57
00:03:37.701 --> 00:03:41.710
So I'll just show you a quick video that will show the,
uh,
the,
uh,

58
00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:42.860
capabilities of the leaf.

59
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:46.663
<v 2>Ah,</v>

60
00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.690
<v 0>so there's a lot of going on there,
but essentially you can,</v>

61
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.340
you can just think of the leaf that we've taken the mechanics of snowboarding

62
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.730
and treated the potential energy that a mountain gives you mountain slope and

63
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.160
uh,
for the electronic,
uh,
uh,

64
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.910
mechanical energy of a electronic motors.
And so really the,
uh,

65
00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.620
the key secret sauce to our system has this three 60 drive that you see here.

66
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.670
So this is really a caster wheel,

67
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.980
just like you see on the bottom of a shopping cart with a motor strapped to it

68
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.210
and a transmitting energy through a,

69
00:05:11.211 --> 00:05:14.940
a slip ring and going into a battery pack and controlled by your hand.

70
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.510
And so those,
those drive wheels,
the base of it,

71
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.920
or a little bit lower to the ground and you can see in the tilting and drifting

72
00:05:22.921 --> 00:05:27.900
part,
the outer edge wheels,
they function just like a snowboard.

73
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.520
So the edges on your snowboard,

74
00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.210
and that's really there for just steering control and braking.

75
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.620
And the rest is you,
uh,
your,
your whole body controls this,

76
00:05:37.621 --> 00:05:39.510
this crazy experience just like a snowboard.

77
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.760
And it's really almost magical if you know how to snowboard and you,

78
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.170
you take all of those,

79
00:05:46.171 --> 00:05:49.200
that muscle memory and that experience and you jump on the,

80
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:53.010
the leaf and you can channel that through.
It just works.
In fact,

81
00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.680
it only works if you write it just like a snowboard.

82
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.240
So how do you stop?
Very important question.
You stop just like a snowboard.

83
00:06:02.241 --> 00:06:06.620
So sliding on your edge wheels,
just like you slide on the edge of a snowboard,

84
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.220
it's the most fun and most effective way of stopping.

85
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.200
You can go from our top speed of 23 miles an hour to a dead stop in less than

86
00:06:15.201 --> 00:06:19.220
two car links,
which have you try that on,
you know,
a bike or something else.

87
00:06:19.221 --> 00:06:22.340
You might,
you know,
go over the handlebars,
but you're leaning into that,

88
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:27.050
that slide in that force.
So you can stop really hard and be really comfortable.

89
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.110
So it gives you a lot of control when you're at top speed.

90
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.140
<v 2>Okay.</v>

91
00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.210
<v 0>And you might've noticed there's these,</v>

92
00:06:34.211 --> 00:06:38.920
these hooks that kind of fit over your feet,
and this adds a ton of control.

93
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:42.730
Just like a snowboard.
Now with a snowboard,
you're locked on,

94
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.420
and so you can't,
uh,
there's no safety bail out with the snowboard,
uh,

95
00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.510
but just knowing to you,
so it's okay.
But when you're operating over Pavan,

96
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:56.440
you definitely want to have the ability to jump off.
And it's funny,
once you,

97
00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.210
once you get rolling on the leaf for a while and you go back to snowboarding,
uh,

98
00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.520
you're,
you're kind of weirdly freaked out by the way,
the ability,

99
00:07:03.521 --> 00:07:06.430
you can't jump off.
So it kind of takes a couple of rounds to get back into it.

100
00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.870
But that's a key feature and a,
a must for getting out of these footholds.

101
00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:16.400
And so on the acceleration,
it's a wireless remote control.

102
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.540
And so you can think of this as kind of controlling your mountain slope.

103
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.360
And so if you have it all the way forward,

104
00:07:23.361 --> 00:07:27.110
the gas pedal completely hammered down.
That's like a triple black diamond,

105
00:07:27.111 --> 00:07:30.710
like dropping in,
just getting off super fast,
uh,

106
00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:34.220
or you can just really lightly move the controller forward.

107
00:07:34.221 --> 00:07:37.820
And it could be like a nice bunny hill slope.
But the nice thing is,

108
00:07:37.821 --> 00:07:40.820
is that at any point in time,
if you get nervous,
uh,

109
00:07:40.821 --> 00:07:42.260
if you get a little bit out of control,

110
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.100
you can let go and the motors will just coast and eventually we'll come to a

111
00:07:46.101 --> 00:07:49.000
stop.
And so really it's a bit like snowboarding,

112
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.140
but you can make the mountain go away anytime you want.

113
00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:56.660
And then we made the battery swappable because if you're a snowboarder,

114
00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.920
even if you've never dreamed about snowboarding on city streets,

115
00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:04.850
you've definitely dreamed about the endless slope because of some point you get

116
00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:08.750
to the bottom of the mountain,
which is a total drag.
So you have to wait in line,

117
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:09.980
get in the lift up.

118
00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:13.820
And so you always dream about that endless slope and we wanted that ability.

119
00:08:13.821 --> 00:08:17.330
And so for us,
the endless slope is getting to the end of a battery,

120
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.850
not having to go home and charge it,

121
00:08:19.851 --> 00:08:22.790
but rather just switch out another battery and keep going.

122
00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:27.950
These batteries will go up to 15 miles and our largest size and so far I haven't

123
00:08:27.951 --> 00:08:29.810
seen anybody go pass three batteries.

124
00:08:29.811 --> 00:08:33.860
That's been kind of the human limit of finance at this point.

125
00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:34.993
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

126
00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:41.310
<v 0>Oh yeah.
So before I get into this part,
um,
uh,
this,</v>

127
00:08:41.311 --> 00:08:44.040
this project,
I mean from,
from the beginning,

128
00:08:44.041 --> 00:08:47.760
I mean that the crux of this was figuring out that powered cast.
We all,

129
00:08:47.761 --> 00:08:52.140
that was the thing that electronic engineers,
mechanical engineers,

130
00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:57.060
investors,
friends and family all told us was it probably impossible.
Um,

131
00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:59.280
but none of us are engineers.

132
00:08:59.281 --> 00:09:02.970
So we didn't have that experience to kind of think it was impossible.

133
00:09:02.971 --> 00:09:05.720
We just knew this had to happen.
We just knew that if,

134
00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:10.690
if we could bring this experience to 365 days a year,
the,

135
00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:11.590
the,
the,

136
00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:15.390
the idea is just so big and such a big life improvement for snowboarders.

137
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:20.940
And so we just,
we didn't understand we had to make it happen.
And so,
um,

138
00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:23.760
we,
we had to kind of go the bootstrapping route,

139
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:27.740
especially since we didn't have a lot of funding.
And,
um,

140
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:29.491
and again,
you know,

141
00:09:29.491 --> 00:09:32.310
when we were pitching investors in the beginning trying to convince them,

142
00:09:32.311 --> 00:09:36.000
the snowboard everywhere,
they just,
nobody would believe.

143
00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:39.900
Even Kickstarter didn't believe.
In fact,
when we launched our Kickstarter,

144
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.230
they flagged us for spam because they thought it was fake.

145
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:46.080
And Luckily I was,

146
00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:50.190
we built this in Brooklyn kickstarters in Brooklyn.
So when I got that email,

147
00:09:50.191 --> 00:09:52.260
I was pretty annoyed because it was real.

148
00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:56.850
So we just grabbed the board a road over to kickstarters headquarters and just

149
00:09:56.851 --> 00:09:59.130
did laps in their lobby until they launched our campaign,

150
00:09:59.131 --> 00:10:02.640
which only took about an hour.
But we got up and we're up and running.

151
00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:06.540
But there were a number of lessons that we learned along the way.

152
00:10:06.541 --> 00:10:08.250
Cause when we started this,

153
00:10:08.251 --> 00:10:11.730
it was kind of early and a lot harder projects happening now,
but,

154
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:15.750
but a few years ago it was,
it was a kind of desperate and there wasn't like a,

155
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:20.850
uh,
a tutorial out there or even,
you know,
a roadmap on how to bootstrap hardware.

156
00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:24.540
But we learned that we were able to do it and we learned a lot of lessons on the

157
00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:27.330
way.
So I'll share those with you.
A number one,

158
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:32.380
youtube is the matrix.
And what I mean by that,
uh,

159
00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:36.900
is my favorite part of the matrix wasn't like dodging bullets or flying.

160
00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:41.130
It was like downloading skills to your brain.
You know,
instantly.

161
00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:42.970
That was what I was most fascinated about it.

162
00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.390
If I could take anything from the matrix and putting real life,

163
00:10:45.391 --> 00:10:49.530
that's what I would pick.
And that's what youtube is in a way.
I mean,

164
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:54.520
I'm not an engineer.
I knew nothing about,
uh,
what we all,
all these,

165
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:57.060
this technology that we had to put together for this board.

166
00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:02.420
And I remember it was like one lazy Thanksgiving afternoon,

167
00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:06.240
everybody at Eaton and we're just kind of all laying around.
And I thought,
wow,

168
00:11:06.241 --> 00:11:10.910
I'd really rather be snowboarding right now.
And I had an electric tape,

169
00:11:10.911 --> 00:11:14.160
but at the time,
and I was thinking like this would just be so,

170
00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.530
such a better experience of,
it would felt like snowboarding.

171
00:11:16.531 --> 00:11:17.760
It would be game changing.

172
00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:22.380
And so I started kind of thinking about those pieces of my electric skateboard

173
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.490
and start searching.
Okay.
Uh,
lithium ion batteries was a big feature.

174
00:11:26.491 --> 00:11:30.930
I knew nothing.
What is the lithium out of battery and I found on Youtube,

175
00:11:30.931 --> 00:11:32.220
but lecture from Carnegie Mellon,

176
00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:35.550
90 minutes about lithium ion battery technology.

177
00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:39.810
And that was four years ago.
Have we've actually gone through a lot,

178
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.130
built this product.
I know,

179
00:11:41.131 --> 00:11:45.970
maybe 5% more than I did that day after watching that lecture.
And you know,

180
00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:49.590
I watched it,
uh,
and as like kind of like a,
you know,
unplugged the matrix.

181
00:11:49.591 --> 00:11:54.370
And I was like,
I know lithium ion batteries.
And then I was like,
okay,
how do I,

182
00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:58.180
how do I go to the next piece?
How do you,
uh,

183
00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.250
put electricity through a rotating circuit?

184
00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:03.160
And it turns out there's these things called slip rings that I didn't even know

185
00:12:03.161 --> 00:12:06.430
about.
And they're there in everything.
A headphone Jack in fact,
as a slip ring.

186
00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:11.380
And so I saw a few videos on those and we kind of had to reinvent the ring a

187
00:12:11.381 --> 00:12:14.770
little bit,
but the,
the,
the main idea was there,
I knew,
okay,
we've,

188
00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:18.010
there's gotta be a slip ring,
there's gotta be a luck,
uh,
electronic batteries.

189
00:12:18.011 --> 00:12:22.540
There's gotta be motors.
And,
you know,
in a lazy afternoon you can surprise,

190
00:12:22.541 --> 00:12:27.220
I get a lot done on youtube if you spend it the right way of course.
But,
uh,

191
00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:32.160
my biggest,
uh,
I guess advice to even engineers is if,

192
00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:34.060
if you don't know anything about the technology,

193
00:12:34.061 --> 00:12:37.510
there's probably a youtube video out there.
And you know,

194
00:12:37.511 --> 00:12:39.830
even if it's some guy in his garage putting a tutorial,

195
00:12:39.831 --> 00:12:43.100
sometimes those are the best ones.
Um,

196
00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:48.790
next w we kind of came up with a way of doing PR and we call the downstairs

197
00:12:48.791 --> 00:12:52.710
demo.
And so traditionally with Pr,
um,

198
00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.000
it's a big part of,

199
00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:57.610
of bootstrapping something because you don't have an ad budget and you probably

200
00:12:57.611 --> 00:13:00.620
can't even hire a PR agent.
And so you've got to get,
you know,

201
00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:04.510
organic articles out there that you weren't paying for.
And uh,

202
00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:07.020
traditionally you know,
you,
you research your right,

203
00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:10.480
the writers that you think you can that would be interested in what you're
doing.

204
00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:13.150
You look at their interests,
the topics that they are,

205
00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:17.350
they alike and how you can position your company and you write an awesome email

206
00:13:17.351 --> 00:13:20.950
that you send at 10:00 AM on Tuesday to kind of catch them in between tasks.

207
00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:23.620
But the problem is everybody is doing that.
You know,

208
00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:28.120
they're getting thousands of emails at 10:00 AM on Tuesday and unfortunately

209
00:13:28.121 --> 00:13:29.440
most likely won't get read.

210
00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:34.840
And so you have to take it a step further and what we call the downstairs demo.

211
00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:38.530
And the first step to that is find out where they work,

212
00:13:38.531 --> 00:13:41.320
the address to where they work.
This is getting creepy,

213
00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:46.240
but just hang in there with me for a second.
So you find out where they work.
Um,

214
00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:49.030
and you show up maybe an hour before or after lunch,

215
00:13:49.031 --> 00:13:53.170
maybe the last hour of the day.
And you get up to their lobby.

216
00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:55.270
You're not going to get past the lobby,
but don't worry,

217
00:13:55.271 --> 00:13:58.840
you don't have to get past the lobby.
You just take a,
you know,
your,

218
00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:03.980
your smartphone and you film yourself using your device in their lobby or in

219
00:14:04.541 --> 00:14:07.120
front of their building.
If they kick you out of the lobby or on the street,

220
00:14:07.121 --> 00:14:11.500
if they make you get off the four Aa,
which has happened.
And in our case,

221
00:14:11.501 --> 00:14:13.300
you know,
just doing donuts and saying,
hey look,

222
00:14:13.301 --> 00:14:18.301
you're one short elevator ride away from trying this crazy new tech that got a

223
00:14:19.121 --> 00:14:20.680
100% response rate.

224
00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:25.630
Not everybody came down but half the people came down and all those people wrote

225
00:14:25.631 --> 00:14:27.460
about us.
That's how we got in the verge,

226
00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:31.270
in Gadget Gizmodo and a lot of big publications.

227
00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:35.650
The other half of the people all said the exact same thing,
which is,
hey,

228
00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:38.320
I've been burned by hardware startup,

229
00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.830
a Kickstarter projects before and I just can't write about you.

230
00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:44.540
And if you can figure that out before you show up to their lobby,

231
00:14:44.541 --> 00:14:48.550
that'd be great.
But you know,
sometimes you just have to show up.
But that's a,

232
00:14:48.551 --> 00:14:49.211
that's a big thing.

233
00:14:49.211 --> 00:14:52.100
I mean we were lucky we were in New York and it was convenient,

234
00:14:52.101 --> 00:14:53.030
but when we did this,

235
00:14:53.031 --> 00:14:58.031
we did an one to two days and so quick trip to New York or la or wherever.

236
00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:02.600
If you're not in these areas,
you can get a lot done.
Okay.

237
00:15:02.601 --> 00:15:04.130
So on the prototyping side,

238
00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:08.030
you're going to need a three d printer if you're prototyping hardware.

239
00:15:08.031 --> 00:15:12.920
Because rapid prototyping is just,
uh,
it's not rapid.
You know,

240
00:15:12.921 --> 00:15:14.610
you're talking one,
you know,

241
00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:18.200
one to three days on the fastest turnaround time and it's incredibly expensive.

242
00:15:18.201 --> 00:15:21.800
In fact,
on the first,
you know,
two models,
you might send a rapid prototyping,

243
00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:26.300
you could actually buy a three d printer and once you make that one to $3,000

244
00:15:26.301 --> 00:15:29.000
investment for a three d printer,
it's almost free.

245
00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:32.630
And you can obviously iterate your,
uh,

246
00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:36.380
your prototypes a lot faster by printing them at home because you are,

247
00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:38.840
you have become essentially a rapid prototyper.

248
00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:43.790
But there's ways to even speed it up beyond that.
So for example,

249
00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:48.680
um,
so you've got a small motor mount that's part of your project and you've got

250
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:53.710
eight features that,
you know,
holes or things that fit into other things,
um,

251
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:58.070
as part of your project.
And you have to dial in each one at a time.
Now say this,

252
00:15:58.071 --> 00:16:02.120
a little motor mount only takes an hour to print,
which is a pretty fast prep.

253
00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:04.520
Okay.
You've got eight features.

254
00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:08.180
Each one will say it takes two or three kind of prince to get it right.

255
00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.720
That's 20 prints you have to make to dial in that one motor mountain.

256
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:15.560
Now that's still lightspeed compared to rapid prototyping.

257
00:16:15.561 --> 00:16:18.560
You won't even get an email back from the company in 20 hours,

258
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:20.540
but you can go way faster.

259
00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:24.950
And that is by printing in two d rather than three d.

260
00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:29.210
And so if you've got that,
that motor mount and you're trying to dial in a hole,

261
00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:34.420
you can actually just print a one millimeter layer face and you know,

262
00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:37.730
peel it off,
get your calipers out,
measure it,
dial it in,

263
00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:40.880
and you can print that one millimeter layer in two minutes.

264
00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:43.970
So 20 prints instead of 20 hours,

265
00:16:43.971 --> 00:16:47.480
you just turn it into 40 minutes of printing and that's how you can dial in

266
00:16:47.481 --> 00:16:50.870
entire parts in an afternoon.
Um,
and that was a big,

267
00:16:50.871 --> 00:16:53.870
big lesson kind of we learned along that way and you know,
look,

268
00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:57.440
took literally days to kind of get all this stuff together and uh,
and,

269
00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:00.640
and be on the road.
Uh,

270
00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.290
definitely iterate with off the shelf components.

271
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:05.630
And this isn't anything a new idea,

272
00:17:05.631 --> 00:17:10.260
but you definitely have to kind of think about,
um,
some of the constraints,
uh,

273
00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:12.590
that might come with those off the shelf components.

274
00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:16.760
And we had to deal with one in particular that was a little scary.

275
00:17:16.761 --> 00:17:19.160
So our first version of this,

276
00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:22.040
we basically took apart an electronic helicopter,

277
00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:26.930
put the motors on a shopping cart wheel and put that onto a skateboard.

278
00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:31.870
And a,
and we were often running.
And what we didn't realize though,
um,

279
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:35.360
is a feature of electronic helicopters,
which is great when you're,

280
00:17:35.361 --> 00:17:38.810
when you're flying.
Um,
if you,
if you lose radio signal,

281
00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:41.150
it'll go a full speed to stay in the air.

282
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:45.380
So I think you guys understand where I'm going with this.

283
00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:49.470
We'd be riding around and in new city,

284
00:17:49.471 --> 00:17:54.210
maybe the most dense place of 2.4 Gigahertz,
uh,
networks.

285
00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:57.960
And when you lose signal,
you go full speed for a good,

286
00:17:57.961 --> 00:18:00.300
like one to two seconds until it kind of gets back.

287
00:18:00.301 --> 00:18:04.560
So it was kind of this mechanical bull that you had to be just ready to go full

288
00:18:04.561 --> 00:18:08.790
speed at any given time.
And so we kind of learned what these parts,
okay.

289
00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:10.590
You know,
we,
we learned these constraints.

290
00:18:10.591 --> 00:18:14.370
And so a lot of the off the shelf parts you kind of have to read a lot more of

291
00:18:14.371 --> 00:18:17.610
the directions then you might be prepared to,
uh,
before you get going.

292
00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:19.560
<v 2>Okay.</v>

293
00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:24.090
<v 0>Um,
then the mobile labs,
so you definitely with hardware,
uh,</v>

294
00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:27.750
you're going to be doing a lot of field testing and in the beginning you're

295
00:18:27.751 --> 00:18:32.430
going to be doing a lot more fixing than actually testing in the field.

296
00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:34.480
And those,
those minutes that you know,

297
00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:37.020
turned into hours and eventually turned into days of testing,

298
00:18:37.021 --> 00:18:40.350
they're like gold in the beginning.
And you know,

299
00:18:40.351 --> 00:18:42.090
when you're out in the field and something breaks,

300
00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:46.020
which in the beginning will happen in the first two minutes,
uh,
you know,

301
00:18:46.021 --> 00:18:47.810
you don't want to have to go back to the office,
you know,

302
00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:51.120
45 minute train ride and go fix it and go back out to the field.

303
00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:53.310
You need to take your mobile lab with you.

304
00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:57.480
And so obviously there's like a lot of mechanical things that are built for

305
00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:02.670
going with you,
like electronic drills,
wrenches,
things like that.

306
00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:04.140
But eventually,
you know,

307
00:19:04.141 --> 00:19:08.730
you're going to have to solder and soldering irons unfortunately take a lot of

308
00:19:08.731 --> 00:19:12.130
current,
uh,
cause they have to get really hot.
And you all know,

309
00:19:12.131 --> 00:19:15.910
I always have a plug with you especially,
um,
if you're,
you know,

310
00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:20.190
going around New York City testing your product so you have to find plugs
around,

311
00:19:20.191 --> 00:19:22.700
but they exist.
You know,
we've soldered,
um,

312
00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:26.670
outside a public bathroom and central park.
Uh,

313
00:19:26.671 --> 00:19:28.920
I've started in a coat closet at the plaza hotel.

314
00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:32.520
They were nice enough to let me get in there and solder,
uh,
there,

315
00:19:32.521 --> 00:19:35.460
they have these random plugs in the ceilings and the subway that you can,

316
00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.680
you can dial into and get enough current to solder,

317
00:19:37.681 --> 00:19:40.410
but just bring a whole lab with you.
Like don't,

318
00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:43.830
don't think you have to go back and just,
you know,
carry everything around.

319
00:19:43.831 --> 00:19:47.100
If you've got to drag a wagon with you,
it's really worth it.
Cause again,

320
00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:51.720
it's going to be two minutes of testing and two hours of fixing in the

321
00:19:51.721 --> 00:19:52.554
beginning.

322
00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:53.750
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

323
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:58.640
<v 0>And so,
um,
yeah I could go on on about hardware stories,
startups,</v>

324
00:19:58.641 --> 00:20:02.960
but I think maybe this is a good time that just switch it over to a Q and.
A.

325
00:20:02.961 --> 00:20:03.920
And again,

326
00:20:03.921 --> 00:20:07.820
I just really appreciate everybody coming out to your story and the invitation.

327
00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:08.683
Thanks so much.

328
00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:14.523
<v 2>Gotcha.</v>

329
00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:19.690
<v 0>No,
we have a question.
Cube.
Anybody?
Okay.</v>

330
00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:20.733
I'm going to try to.

331
00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:24.140
<v 3>Awesome Gum.
Um,</v>

332
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:29.650
so the big difference I see,
um,
in terms of the,

333
00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:34.100
between this and boring skateboarding is the terrible things you're doing to the

334
00:20:34.101 --> 00:20:37.100
wheel.
Um,
so,
uh,

335
00:20:37.101 --> 00:20:40.460
this was that you said that people go through three batteries,

336
00:20:40.461 --> 00:20:41.990
which they don't have to take home and recharge.

337
00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:44.520
How often does it have to replace the wheels?
Yeah,

338
00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:47.560
<v 0>good question.
So we're in skateboarding,</v>

339
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:50.880
you'll have a couple of factors that go into your wheels.
Uh,

340
00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:55.300
one is kind of rebound,
how,
how,
how bouncy it is.
Another one's called durometer,

341
00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:58.960
which is how hard it is.
And so they have durometers from like,
you know,

342
00:20:58.961 --> 00:21:03.400
like jelly all the way to hard plastic and the escape of wheels fall somewhere

343
00:21:03.401 --> 00:21:04.234
in between.

344
00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:09.070
And so the harder durometer will last longer because it just resists that,

345
00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:11.260
uh,
that abrasion a little bit better.

346
00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:15.790
And also it slides better because a,
it's not gripping that pavement.

347
00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:19.600
And so we use a bit harder derometer wheels.

348
00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:23.530
Then probably the average skateboard would skateboard or we consider our wheels

349
00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:26.230
a bit hard on that derometer side.
But again,

350
00:21:26.231 --> 00:21:30.700
it kind of works with that sliding and it lasts a lot longer.
And also a key,

351
00:21:30.701 --> 00:21:34.240
so you can tell a little bit in this,
in this image.

352
00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:39.070
So the outside of the wheels are kind of getting dirty and they start to cone.

353
00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:44.610
And so whenever you get too much where you just flip the wheel 180 degrees and

354
00:21:44.861 --> 00:21:47.950
they start working on the other side and then you flip it again and you flip it

355
00:21:47.951 --> 00:21:51.280
again and you might get six flips before you have to change the wheels.

356
00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:56.770
When I had a,
it was a five mile round trip commute in Brooklyn,

357
00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:01.950
a set of wheels when flipped regularly with last about six months.
This,

358
00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:05.500
yeah.
Wow.
But when you're commuting,

359
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:08.440
you're not obviously doing a bunch of three sixties and things,
you know,

360
00:22:08.441 --> 00:22:12.550
you've got places to be so
good even so.
Yeah,
you can,

361
00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:14.410
you can make a set of wheels last very long time.

362
00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:19.560
<v 3>Uh,
so,
uh,
when you say you're going with a harder material,
um,</v>

363
00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:24.720
what's the,
um,
what's kind of snow skinniness is,
does this correspond to,

364
00:22:24.721 --> 00:22:27.810
is it like a prepared piece or morning,

365
00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:32.760
somewhat frozen over or just these skip the braking performance?

366
00:22:32.761 --> 00:22:35.430
You had looked pretty good.
So it feels,

367
00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.530
if it looks like it feels like a pretty soft snow.

368
00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:41.040
<v 0>Yeah.
I would say the,
and the most ideal scenario,</v>

369
00:22:41.041 --> 00:22:46.041
which is a nice kind of broken and we all and super smooth,

370
00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:50.160
uh,
it's really the pavement actually that kinda determines the feeling that more

371
00:22:50.161 --> 00:22:54.810
than anything.
Um,
if you're on like a garage floor,
say like a really slick,

372
00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:58.690
uh,
concrete,
uh,
it's,
it's,

373
00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:03.240
it's not like ice,
but it's definitely like a really hard packed,
we'll say.
Uh,

374
00:23:03.241 --> 00:23:07.260
but the best is kind of a,
a nice,
uh,
kind of blacktop,
like a,

375
00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:10.490
like a fresh street that just feels like a nice groomer.

376
00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:14.190
Like you've got the first group of run of the day and you're just just jetting

377
00:23:14.191 --> 00:23:16.770
super fast.
Uh,
I'd say it's kind of more like that.

378
00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:21.373
Nice.

379
00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:24.530
<v 4>Um,
this is really awesome.</v>

380
00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:28.460
Can you talk a little bit more about how you like eject from the board or how

381
00:23:28.461 --> 00:23:30.900
the straps come off?
Like can you adjust to the,

382
00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:35.690
the degree to which you're strapped in and then like how does the trigger word,

383
00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.160
I didn't know it was two buttons in your video.

384
00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:42.200
<v 0>Yeah.
So,
uh,
straps first we,
where we go.
Okay,
here we go.</v>

385
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:45.980
So Chris actually did that and told him,
I said,
okay,

386
00:23:45.981 --> 00:23:50.330
you're going to have to catch a front edge
and Jen bail out.

387
00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:54.290
Which if you do this on a snowboard,
there's no,
there's no turning back.

388
00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:57.990
I mean you're going to,
you're going to go face down.
So,
uh,

389
00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:00.110
we probably should have this in slow mo,

390
00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:05.000
but more or less when you're to get out and eject really easily,
you,

391
00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:10.010
the,
the,
the footholds are kind of out from the edge.
So when you're riding,

392
00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:14.770
you're putting outward pressure with your feet to really like hold in and,

393
00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:17.960
and kind of maintain that position.
But to get out,

394
00:24:17.961 --> 00:24:21.920
you just bring your feet together and if you bring your feet together you can

395
00:24:21.921 --> 00:24:26.060
even jump forward.
But if you don't,
you know,
you can jump backwards or whatever.

396
00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:28.220
But um,
yeah,
we're kind of trained.

397
00:24:28.221 --> 00:24:30.890
And did you get a muscle memory after doing a couple of times and just like

398
00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:36.200
hopping together and getting out and you can adjust the height and how tight it

399
00:24:36.201 --> 00:24:37.850
is and things like that.
So you,

400
00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:42.230
I ride a little bit looser cause I like to be able to jump out very easily.

401
00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:44.870
And so,
um,
but you want that control.

402
00:24:44.871 --> 00:24:48.770
You want to be able to really like press in because that's really going to give

403
00:24:48.771 --> 00:24:53.180
you that board control
on the remote control.

404
00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:58.160
So there's a trigger and a thumbwheel.
And that's really,

405
00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:03.180
you can find that on most a wireless remote electronic redoubles because there's

406
00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:07.670
the safety or dead man's switch,
which is,
which in our case is the trigger.

407
00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:10.250
And then there's the thumb wheel,
which is the accelerator.

408
00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:12.980
And there's kind of two schools of thought.

409
00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:15.980
And as the skateboarding or electric skateboard communities kind of split down

410
00:25:15.981 --> 00:25:19.760
the middle and it's just whether you have the dead man's switch on your thumb or

411
00:25:19.761 --> 00:25:22.430
your forefinger and you have the,
the uh,

412
00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:24.170
accelerator on your thumb or the four fingers.

413
00:25:24.171 --> 00:25:27.710
So the other way of doing it is putting the detriments switch on your thumb.

414
00:25:27.711 --> 00:25:30.950
And then the trigger kind of like,
you know,
the old little RC cars.

415
00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:35.480
The reason we didn't go that route is because we do find that some people when

416
00:25:35.481 --> 00:25:40.130
they crash,
they grip,
you know,
and you definitely don't want to go full speed.

417
00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:45.270
And so,
um,
even in our case,
uh,
if you grip,
you're not going to,

418
00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:48.550
you know,
likely move the thumb wheel forward.
But,
uh,

419
00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:52.760
moving the thumb wheel backward,
we'll actually provide electronic braking,

420
00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:57.050
which typically we only use if you're in like a tight space and you can't turn

421
00:25:57.051 --> 00:26:01.790
sideways to break.
But,
um,
the slide,
I need a break.
I mean,

422
00:26:01.791 --> 00:26:04.160
that's the most fun,
the most effective.

423
00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:09.460
And it actually got us a about less than half the product insurance rate,

424
00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:13.610
I say as a normal actor,
skateboard because,
uh,
with those breaks there,

425
00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:18.730
they're all electronic and you can lose your base by losing the wireless signal,

426
00:26:19.671 --> 00:26:22.700
breaking a belt,
um,
or,
uh,

427
00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:26.690
going over 25 miles an hour at which there's too much momentum to stop you.

428
00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:31.880
And so,
so that provides a lot of stability and safety.
Great.
Thanks.
Yeah,

429
00:26:31.881 --> 00:26:35.500
and I have actually like dreamed about snowboarding to work and still working on

430
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:38.930
roads.
So yeah,
it's here.

431
00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:43.790
If you could talk a little bit about your background,

432
00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:47.970
what you were doing before you started this.
Sure.
Uh,

433
00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:53.370
I actually,
uh,
I co founded a marketing agency with a couple of buddies,

434
00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:58.500
uh,
when I was 24 years old.
And,
uh,
it was,
uh,

435
00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:01.100
doing a lot of digital marketing,
a lot of Seo.

436
00:27:01.101 --> 00:27:06.000
So Google is obviously very relevant to our daily lives in that agency.

437
00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:10.360
And,
uh,
you know,
but I'm a lifelong snowboarder.
This is something,
you know,

438
00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:12.000
that I,
I always dreamed of.

439
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:16.770
I actually had started a version of that company when I was in high school and,

440
00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:20.160
uh,
my junior year I actually moved out of my parents' house and started just

441
00:27:20.161 --> 00:27:24.420
snowboarding all the time and barely graduated.
But it was always,
uh,

442
00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:27.930
I kind of,
my dream,
my dream thing,

443
00:27:27.931 --> 00:27:30.180
cause I'm from Indiana originally and it's super flat,

444
00:27:30.181 --> 00:27:33.210
but there's a lot of snow and I would only get to ride once a year.

445
00:27:33.211 --> 00:27:37.290
And so dreaming about that,
um,
at the end of every snowboard trip,
just,

446
00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:42.150
it's always been kind of in the back of my head.
But yeah,
I had a background of,

447
00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.310
you know,
starting a,
a company before.

448
00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:49.320
And so when on that Thanksgiving Day when,
when this,

449
00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:53.700
this thing got in my head,
it just couldn't get out.
And so,
um,
eventually when,

450
00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:56.370
when leave started growing and I needed more of my time,

451
00:27:56.371 --> 00:27:59.260
I switched over full time,
uh,
from my agency to leave tech.

452
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:06.440
<v 2>Can you</v>

453
00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:08.440
<v 3>tell a bit how do you see,
uh,</v>

454
00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:12.570
the involvement that the next model or the next generation,

455
00:28:12.571 --> 00:28:14.790
how do you see this product going even further?

456
00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:15.580
<v 2>Okay.</v>

457
00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:16.750
<v 0>Yeah,
for sure.
Um,</v>

458
00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:22.710
I think that lithium ion battery technology is going to define a lot of the

459
00:28:22.781 --> 00:28:26.870
direction because we've,
we've really nailed the experience in terms of,
uh,

460
00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:31.960
that snowboarding feeling and I think that future products,
uh,
from us,

461
00:28:31.961 --> 00:28:36.100
we'll,
we'll,
we'll maybe get a little bit more dialed in on that.
I mean that,

462
00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:39.490
that feature is really nice,
but I think it's more about just being lighter,

463
00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:43.790
possibly being faster.
But I'm really just,

464
00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:45.970
and getting the price down.
I think a kid,

465
00:28:45.971 --> 00:28:50.440
it could help a bit and that'll come with volume as we,
as we grow.
But you know,

466
00:28:50.441 --> 00:28:53.860
just really,
you know,
serving these 39 million snowboarders around the world.

467
00:28:53.861 --> 00:28:57.700
That's,
that's our dream is just to,
to grow our beloved sport and,

468
00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:00.610
and make it a year round a type initiative.

469
00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:05.290
<v 3>You just led into the question I've been holding ground.
Um,
so with,</v>

470
00:29:05.291 --> 00:29:06.560
with a skateboard,

471
00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:09.850
I can see your point with putting the battery pack on the board because you

472
00:29:09.851 --> 00:29:13.390
routinely to batch you take your feet off the board.
Um,
but with this,

473
00:29:13.391 --> 00:29:14.680
when you're traveling,
strapped in,

474
00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:19.330
you've got much less reason to keep you keep the battery back on the board.
Um,

475
00:29:19.331 --> 00:29:23.920
so you could wear it.
Um,
and you just mentioned that the board is heavy.

476
00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:28.690
How are you implying that the board with all the stuff on it is heavier than,

477
00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:32.080
or you snowboard and pair of depressingly heavy boots?

478
00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:34.220
<v 0>Well,
actually it's about equal.</v>

479
00:29:34.221 --> 00:29:38.270
So because you have so much gear on when you're snowboarding,
so you through,

480
00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:40.580
you know,
your boots,
your jacket,
your pants,

481
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:44.230
gloves and all these things in a pile with their snowboard.
I,
it's,

482
00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:47.770
it's about the same weight.
And so,
you know,
we're still talking,
you know,
15,

483
00:29:47.771 --> 00:29:51.950
16 pounds,
um,
on our smallest model.
But,
you know,
I mean the,
the,

484
00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:54.130
the dream is to go even lighter if,
if you don't,

485
00:29:54.131 --> 00:29:56.380
you're not living in New York or San Francisco,

486
00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:59.680
you're probably not walking a lot with the board.
So,
uh,

487
00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:03.040
it's not really an issue for most people just throw in the back of their car,

488
00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:04.930
but we definitely want it to be lighter.
I mean,

489
00:30:04.931 --> 00:30:07.750
that's just probably a better experience all around.
And you know,

490
00:30:07.751 --> 00:30:12.070
I do believe that one day you'll buy a cell phone with all the energy you'll

491
00:30:12.071 --> 00:30:16.040
ever need for it.
Um,
and so hopefully that'll happen at the same,
uh,

492
00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:20.710
with our board as well.
So,

493
00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:24.460
um,
I think the design of your straps is a really interesting,

494
00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:26.940
and I was wondering if you've explored,
um,

495
00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:30.850
so I have one of those surf style skateboards with the,

496
00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:32.170
I don't know if you've seen these,

497
00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:36.280
where the front trucks really turn a lot.

498
00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:39.810
He has got a castle real kind of,
Oh,
well,
yeah,
yeah.
It pivots right?

499
00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:43.420
That kind of thing.
It's made by a company,
a local company called Carver,

500
00:30:43.421 --> 00:30:45.910
the one that I have.
And uh,
and I love it,

501
00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:49.700
but you can't easily all you with that skateboard.
Um,

502
00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:54.430
because it's a little bit unstable.
It occurs to me that like if,
if I had straps,

503
00:30:54.431 --> 00:30:55.930
kind of like your straps,

504
00:30:56.260 --> 00:31:00.190
I could probably jump up curbs without a problem with that.

505
00:31:00.191 --> 00:31:04.900
And it might be an interesting thing to try.
I don't know that.

506
00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:09.000
Have you,
when you were prototyping this stuff,
did you try it on,

507
00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:13.330
on some more standard kind of,
uh,
skateboards?

508
00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:18.700
Well,
they're a bit scary on a skateboard and I'll tell you why.
One,

509
00:31:18.701 --> 00:31:22.810
it's kind of hard to push and then get back in.
But the second thing is,
I mean,

510
00:31:22.811 --> 00:31:27.520
you can't slide and stop,
so you really,
really,
really don't want to be locked in.

511
00:31:27.521 --> 00:31:29.380
I mean,
that's why we're the skateboard.

512
00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:33.190
Electric skateboard has to be completely clean on the top so you can kind of

513
00:31:33.191 --> 00:31:35.590
move around and get your stance.
But for us,
you know,

514
00:31:35.591 --> 00:31:39.670
you're really fixed on the outside.
And so that ability to slide the stop,

515
00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:44.130
I mean that's what the food was really help you with.
But on a skateboard,
um,

516
00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:48.050
again,
it's,
it,
if you're not pushing then,
um,

517
00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:52.530
you don't have to worry about moving back in to push though if you have it

518
00:31:52.531 --> 00:31:55.410
electronic.
But again,
like,
uh,
it's,

519
00:31:55.860 --> 00:32:00.610
it's a little scary just because you can't,
you can't slide and stop.
I see.
Yeah.

520
00:32:00.611 --> 00:32:03.240
The,
the thing about pushing is like with,

521
00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:07.840
with those special trucks that I was talking about,
you can,
you can basically,

522
00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:09.400
you barely need to push,

523
00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:14.330
you can just go side to side and Carlo the pumping the pump,
but,

524
00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:18.640
but yeah,
I get the is the stopping part.
That's scary.
Yes.

525
00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:21.940
How do you stop on this thing?
I mean,

526
00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:27.130
I guess sometimes you can jump off,
uh,
you can do a power slide type thing.

527
00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:31.030
Okay.
And then your wheels.
Yeah.
Maybe if you like got over that,
uh,

528
00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:34.960
that caster and maybe you're able to slide,
get a lot of friction maybe.

529
00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:41.000
But yeah,
I find them scary on almost anything else,
but yeah,
we have tried that.

530
00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:43.610
You definitely want to be able to turn and stop.

531
00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:46.853
<v 2>Okay.</v>

532
00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:52.500
<v 4>Has anyone ever done anything that you weren't expecting them to do?</v>

533
00:32:52.501 --> 00:32:53.334
What the board?

534
00:32:55.440 --> 00:33:00.320
<v 0>Um,
well I think that,
you know,
the,
the hardest part of this project,</v>

535
00:33:00.321 --> 00:33:04.230
it wasn't getting the thing invented actually that we did that in about five

536
00:33:04.231 --> 00:33:05.500
months from,
you know,

537
00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:10.110
just an empty desk with drawings to actually a thing on the ground that,

538
00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:11.340
you know,
you could slide stopped up.

539
00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:14.970
The hard part was getting it to something that a consumer is not going to break

540
00:33:14.971 --> 00:33:17.610
in the first 10 minutes.
Um,
yeah,

541
00:33:17.611 --> 00:33:22.020
I mean I think consumers will do like things with your product that you wouldn't

542
00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:27.480
imagine.
Uh,
you know,
this is sitting on the,
the,
the motherboard for example.

543
00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:30.880
Um,
but I think some of the,

544
00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:35.460
the more surprising thing was just kind of how quickly a lot of people have

545
00:33:35.461 --> 00:33:37.260
picked it up.
Um,
you know,

546
00:33:37.261 --> 00:33:39.900
I think in my case it was a little different because I was writing,

547
00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:42.720
put it as a gray constantly.
So I kind of took me forever to learn.

548
00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:46.860
But seeing how quickly people jump on and just start sliding around.
I mean,

549
00:33:46.861 --> 00:33:49.160
it just blows my mind sometimes and I'm like,
wow,

550
00:33:49.161 --> 00:33:51.750
it took me hours to get to that point.

551
00:33:51.751 --> 00:33:55.150
And there they literally just kind of jumped off.
But the,

552
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:59.160
the key thing was,
was dialing in the snowboard feel.

553
00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:01.290
And so if you snowboard,

554
00:34:01.291 --> 00:34:05.190
we actually have you close your eyes when we put you on the board for the first

555
00:34:05.191 --> 00:34:08.880
time and we control the speed.
Uh,
and we,
you know,
we'd let you,

556
00:34:08.881 --> 00:34:10.800
we hold the shoulder so you have a little bit stability.

557
00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:15.540
But if you close your eyes and you imagine you're on the snow,
it just,

558
00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:18.560
it just happens immediately.
Just magically.
Um,

559
00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:21.270
but then when you open your eyes and you,
you know,
you see the pavement,

560
00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:25.270
all these other things that Kinda make you nervous,
uh,
then you know,
you,

561
00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:27.450
you've got to kind of learn to get over that.

562
00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:31.810
But while we learned from doing a lot of demos is if somebody has snowberry

563
00:34:31.811 --> 00:34:33.650
experience,
just blindfold them,

564
00:34:33.651 --> 00:34:36.540
may their close your eyes do something because then they'll feel that in the

565
00:34:36.541 --> 00:34:37.530
first 10 seconds.

566
00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:42.390
And once they feel that slide because it really does feel like snow cause you're

567
00:34:42.391 --> 00:34:46.050
kind of going sideways and like that just doesn't happen anywhere else.
Um,

568
00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:49.110
then then they're hooked,
then they will,
they will go through and,

569
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:52.380
and fall or do anything to kind of have that,
that feeling again.

570
00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:55.220
And so that was like a big thing we learned,
uh,

571
00:34:55.500 --> 00:35:00.030
going on is like get a user and sliding as,
as quickly as possible.

572
00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:08.210
<v 4>So you were saying that it's pretty easy to learn if I don't know how to</v>

573
00:35:08.211 --> 00:35:10.040
snowboard,
but I don't know how to Skateboard,

574
00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:14.190
<v 0>you're actually better off.
Okay.
The,
in fact,</v>

575
00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:15.940
the best candidate that,

576
00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:20.400
that we could ask for that it's never got on our board before is somebody that

577
00:35:20.401 --> 00:35:21.690
has never skateboarded.

578
00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:24.300
Cause there's certain things you have to unlearn from skateboarding.

579
00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:27.150
If you ride this like a skateboard,
it just won't work.
It'll be super frustrated.

580
00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:31.470
Um,
somebody was snowboarding experience obviously,
but also a surfer.

581
00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:34.110
So if you can surf and snowboard,

582
00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:38.400
you'll pick it up pretty quickly because surfing,
I mean,
learn that,

583
00:35:38.401 --> 00:35:41.220
that middle balance point,
because you know,
learning to surf,

584
00:35:41.221 --> 00:35:43.680
it feels like you're,
you're on ice,
it's just crazy.

585
00:35:43.681 --> 00:35:45.510
But you really learned to kind of balance over.

586
00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:48.570
And that's a key thing in the beginning because when we started people on the

587
00:35:48.571 --> 00:35:52.200
board,
we don't put them under the footholds in the beginning because you know,

588
00:35:52.201 --> 00:35:53.790
they've got to kind of learn how to bail off.

589
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.970
And so without those footholds to pull the board around,

590
00:35:57.270 --> 00:36:00.000
you really have to maintain that center balance.

591
00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:03.060
And we find that surfers a do really well at that.

592
00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:07.640
So like people from Brazil just jump on the board and they're just like gone

593
00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:12.420
there.
They pick it up really quickly.
How much is this board?
So,

594
00:36:12.421 --> 00:36:17.100
uh,
the 10 mile model starts at 1549.
Okay.
And,
uh,

595
00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:21.300
hopefully if you're watching this video in a few years,
it's a lot less.
Okay.

596
00:36:21.301 --> 00:36:24.630
And the last question,
so I remember a while ago I saw this,

597
00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:29.250
I don't know if this might be,
this is the same company freeboard basic.
Yes,

598
00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:34.260
it looks like kind of looks like this does without the mater.
Yeah.
So really,

599
00:36:34.261 --> 00:36:38.660
I mean we definitely invented a few things along the way,
but I mean,
uh,

600
00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:41.820
at a high level we just took existing tech and just put it in,

601
00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:44.790
combined it in different ways.
So,
um,

602
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:48.680
the freeboard plus the boosted you can kind of think of as her,

603
00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:50.670
because I remember thinking exactly that like,
oh,

604
00:36:50.671 --> 00:36:54.820
I wish it would just go and flood them.
So yeah,
no,
when I,

605
00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:57.990
when I saw that for the first time,
um,
it was like,

606
00:36:58.350 --> 00:37:01.920
I've never had a religious experience,
but when I saw that it was like,
it just,

607
00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:05.220
it was,
it was incredible.
Uh,
but then I did some research and,
well,

608
00:37:05.221 --> 00:37:08.710
you have to have a hill.
And I was living in Manhattan.
There's no hills.
Uh,

609
00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:12.890
W I was even going to buy just to read in a parking garage,
but as a skateboard,

610
00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:16.530
I know you get kids that kicked out of parking garages like instantly.
So,
uh,

611
00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:20.220
I was kind of back to square one,
but,
uh,
you know,
when Bootsie came out and,

612
00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:25.290
and they were the first to use the AC motors is really tiny motors and,
uh,

613
00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:29.820
and I got one and I was like,
okay,
I,
I think it's possible now,
but again,
that,

614
00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:32.190
you know,
putting strapping it to a caster wheel,

615
00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:35.910
no one thought that was possible.
Absolutely.
Ciro nobody.

616
00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:43.320
<v 3>Uh,</v>

617
00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:47.970
so do you think people can use this to like a train for snowboarding?

618
00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:49.880
<v 0>Yeah,
absolutely.</v>

619
00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:53.600
<v 3>Wants to snowboard but doesn't know how to do it yet.</v>

620
00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:55.290
<v 0>Yeah.
So,
uh,</v>

621
00:37:55.330 --> 00:37:59.560
we definitely do what we want to be the gateway drug to snowboarding,

622
00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:04.260
you know,
for people in areas that don't have snow.
And,
uh,

623
00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:08.210
I love snowboarding so much and I just respect the sport so much that,
you know,

624
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:12.010
when we launched,
I felt inherently that this could make people better,

625
00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:15.310
but I didn't want to,
uh,
make that claim up front saying,

626
00:38:15.370 --> 00:38:16.510
this is gonna make you a better snowboarder.

627
00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:19.790
But that is the feedback we're getting from our customers.
Uh,

628
00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:23.110
especially people that have only been a couple times and they're really new to

629
00:38:23.111 --> 00:38:27.100
the sport and they get the leaf.
Um,
and uh,
you know,

630
00:38:27.101 --> 00:38:31.480
one of my favorites was a customer we have in Singapore that he had been on a

631
00:38:31.481 --> 00:38:35.640
couple trips,
was just obsessed with the sport,
got our board,
he went up,

632
00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:38.290
he went on a snowboarding trip with some buddies.
Um,

633
00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:41.770
meanwhile bought our board and he got back to Singapore,

634
00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:42.940
ruinous board for three weeks,

635
00:38:42.941 --> 00:38:47.290
went on another snowboarding trip and a with the same bodies and they all were

636
00:38:47.291 --> 00:38:51.940
like,
you,
you just had a whole season.
What happened?
Like,
you got way better.
And,

637
00:38:51.941 --> 00:38:54.550
uh,
and,
and that's the thing.
I mean,
when you're snowboarding,

638
00:38:54.551 --> 00:38:59.200
when you take into account lift lines and lifts and lunch and you know,

639
00:38:59.201 --> 00:39:02.560
the first day you're going to be smoked and the first couple hours you might

640
00:39:02.561 --> 00:39:06.730
only have of like real actual writing,
you know,
just a few hours a day.

641
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:10.570
And so,
you know,
if you can get out with the leaf,
uh,

642
00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:13.890
and one battery will last you a few hours and you can charge that a couple of

643
00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:18.850
times a day.
I mean,
you can get seasons of writing and literally weeks,
so,

644
00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:19.361
so yeah,

645
00:39:19.361 --> 00:39:24.361
we were really happy to see that it was actually improving people's writing.

646
00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:27.500
And,
and when we were in New York,
we actually had somebody,
um,

647
00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:32.260
it was as I or called us up and say,
Hey,
I've got to be at this,
uh,

648
00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:35.800
the snowboard mountain to kind of do a customer meeting and ride with them.

649
00:39:35.801 --> 00:39:39.670
And I do,
I don't know how to snowboard if I buy your board,
can I,

650
00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:44.080
can I get up to speed and learn?
And,
uh,
I was like,
yeah,
I think so.

651
00:39:44.081 --> 00:39:45.950
And we actually connected them with one of our,
uh,

652
00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:48.870
pro writers in New York to kind of show them the ropes and a,

653
00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:50.830
I don't know if it closes a deal,
but I'm,
but,
uh,

654
00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:54.310
he was super happy and actually road,
so,
so yeah,

655
00:39:54.311 --> 00:39:56.920
I can definitely get you into the sport.

656
00:39:58.380 --> 00:39:59.213
<v 2>Nope.</v>

657
00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:09.090
<v 4>So when you,
Ollie,
do you try to land on the front wheels?</v>

658
00:40:09.091 --> 00:40:13.770
Because if you land on the motor,
is he my easily damages?

659
00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:18.730
<v 0>Um,
actually all the forests bypasses the motors.</v>

660
00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:23.230
So you actually want to land on your,
on your base flat.
Yeah.

661
00:40:23.231 --> 00:40:26.800
I mean a more experienced writer can kind of land on an edge or something like

662
00:40:26.801 --> 00:40:29.590
that,
but landing flat is really what you want to do and,
and yeah,

663
00:40:29.591 --> 00:40:33.650
you're coming down on those casters.
But the way that the,

664
00:40:33.690 --> 00:40:34.840
the mechanical system,

665
00:40:34.841 --> 00:40:38.950
you might be able to tell if I could pause this,

666
00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:41.090
it's animated Gif,
but um,

667
00:40:41.590 --> 00:40:45.820
the motor is really just kind of hanging off a mount on the front and so all

668
00:40:45.821 --> 00:40:49.670
that load is going straight through the wheel into the deck and you know,

669
00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:52.930
through you and then back down.
But it kind of bypasses that motor.
Really.

670
00:40:52.931 --> 00:40:55.560
The motor is just kind of hanging off and the only load on the motors,

671
00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:58.770
the timing belt.
So it's built,
I mean,
uh,

672
00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:03.400
we've done seven stair gaps,
which is,
you know,
maybe Yay high.

673
00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:09.130
And uh,
and yeah,
it's,
it's,
it's so funny.
You just have to like channel that,

674
00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:12.760
that,
that snowboarding feeling and that those mechanics,
if you,

675
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:15.970
if you approach it like something new,
it's super scary.
But if you,

676
00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:18.370
if you're like,
oh,
this is,
you know,
just imagine the snow,

677
00:41:18.371 --> 00:41:21.950
like channel your five year old self and like see the snow,
it,

678
00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:24.100
it did just magically works.
It's crazy.

679
00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:27.370
<v 4>Okay.
So when you drop him down from seven stairs,</v>

680
00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:31.900
lands like power slide or more like a skateboard.

681
00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:34.160
<v 0>You can you in fact,</v>

682
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:36.620
<v 2>one of our writers is his name's slide jump slide.</v>

683
00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:41.340
These slides jumps and my hands on a slide.
But yeah,
that's,

684
00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:45.380
it's a super challenging,
uh,
trick,
but,
but yeah,
it's,
it's definitely,
I mean,

685
00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:48.620
that's like the great thing about snowboarding and our board is like,

686
00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:53.600
there's this endless progression and endless styles and so,
so yeah,

687
00:41:53.601 --> 00:41:57.290
you can land sideways if you really want to.
Okay,
cool.
Thanks.

688
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:05.383
<v 0>Oh,
do we have,
okay,</v>

689
00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:09.160
<v 5>you talked a little bit about the,</v>

690
00:42:09.161 --> 00:42:14.161
your industrial design process and you talk a lot about wanting to,

691
00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:17.320
um,
uh,
to mirror the experience of snowboarding.

692
00:42:17.321 --> 00:42:20.350
So how did you think about that when you were designing the board and

693
00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:21.700
communicating the,

694
00:42:21.701 --> 00:42:24.970
the visual design to a consumer that may not have seen the video?

695
00:42:25.650 --> 00:42:29.860
<v 0>For sure.
Um,
so for us,
you know,</v>

696
00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:33.120
to call this a,
I'm a snowboarder and if this didn't feel like stuff,

697
00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:35.760
I have zero interest in it.
And so in the beginning,

698
00:42:35.770 --> 00:42:37.260
that's kind of how we got our name.

699
00:42:37.261 --> 00:42:42.261
So the Turing test of our board was being able to like falling leaf down the

700
00:42:42.421 --> 00:42:45.270
street.
So that's the first move you learn on snow.

701
00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:47.400
You're just kind of like falling leaf down the mountain.

702
00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:51.660
And so our board had to do that.
Nothing else can,

703
00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:53.730
can falling leaf down down a city street.

704
00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:57.380
And so we just kept iterating and getting into where,
you know,

705
00:42:57.390 --> 00:43:00.150
we had enough torque to do that.
You know,
in the beginning we were,

706
00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:03.930
we were literally burning the coils of the motors,
but,
uh,

707
00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:06.240
it takes a lot of Torque,
um,
uh,
powered caster wheel.

708
00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:09.360
But in terms of the industrial design,
um,

709
00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:12.120
honestly for the first version,

710
00:43:12.810 --> 00:43:16.320
you can kind of tell for the generation of the person that designer that kind of

711
00:43:16.321 --> 00:43:17.340
looks like a,
like an,

712
00:43:17.610 --> 00:43:21.570
like a first nes or maybe the first playstation or something that's real,
edgy,

713
00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:26.670
dark,
uh,
you know,
uh,
device.
But I think that,

714
00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:30.990
you know,
when you see it and,
and,
and this,
this thing popping out of the middle,

715
00:43:30.991 --> 00:43:33.690
I mean,
obviously you're not going to put your feet there,
but you know,

716
00:43:33.691 --> 00:43:36.630
your feet are,
you,
you kind of have like a,
a notion of,
of,

717
00:43:36.631 --> 00:43:38.040
of kind of how to stand on it,
just,

718
00:43:38.041 --> 00:43:42.210
just nationally where that grip tape is and things.
But,
um,
yeah,
I think with,

719
00:43:42.211 --> 00:43:44.910
with future versions it can be a little bit,

720
00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:48.600
maybe more communicated like a snowboard.
Uh,
also the,

721
00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:51.780
you can't really tell them this photo,
but there's,
uh,
it's,

722
00:43:51.781 --> 00:43:56.470
it's just by directional.
There's technically no front to the board.
Um,
we,

723
00:43:56.490 --> 00:44:00.810
we do have some traction control for beginners.
So we're,

724
00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:05.740
we're sensing which direction the boards going and applying a power rela

725
00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:09.000
relative to that,
that direction.
So if you,
you know,
if your switch,

726
00:44:09.001 --> 00:44:11.790
you won't have like anti attraction control,
it's got a,

727
00:44:11.791 --> 00:44:14.880
it's got to follow with you if you,
if you go the other way.
Um,

728
00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:17.480
and I think that kind of helps too because when they get out of the box or you

729
00:44:17.481 --> 00:44:19.770
know,
which way is forward,
but it doesn't matter.
It just,

730
00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:22.740
it knows which way is forward.
But I think there's,
yeah,

731
00:44:22.741 --> 00:44:26.970
the definitely design wise,
um,
we can pick up a lot more in the next version.

732
00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:32.940
<v 5>Uh,
one other unrelated question you that,
uh,
you,
you started up in,</v>

733
00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:35.430
in New York and you know,

734
00:44:35.431 --> 00:44:38.490
this genre product immediately made me think of Casey Neistat,

735
00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:42.900
who's a very popular youtuber that's so he's messing around with electric,

736
00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:48.010
you know,
modes of transportation,
as has he tried this yet?
Uh,

737
00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:52.180
<v 0>uh,
you know,
it's funny.
We,
um,
he,
I don't think he's tried it.</v>

738
00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:55.210
We actually ran into them when we were Beta testing.
Uh,

739
00:44:55.211 --> 00:45:00.211
it was like 10 degrees January in New York and there was nobody out except one

740
00:45:01.271 --> 00:45:05.860
of our Beta writers,
which is actually my brother.
And,
um,
and he was testing,
uh,

741
00:45:05.861 --> 00:45:07.780
along,
uh,
ubid in New York,

742
00:45:07.781 --> 00:45:10.030
but there's like the freedom tower and there's this huge bike lane.

743
00:45:10.330 --> 00:45:13.780
It's really nice and smooth and if it's 10 degrees out and nobody's on it.

744
00:45:13.781 --> 00:45:18.010
So he was out there,
they're going.
And Casey was actually,
um,

745
00:45:18.130 --> 00:45:23.130
you know how he rides his board and films himself and he came up on our,

746
00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:27.400
uh,
on our bid writer and of course,
like he,
he threw this huge sign.
He's like,

747
00:45:27.401 --> 00:45:30.840
Whoa,
what is that?
And he stopped him and um,

748
00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:35.810
he actually put us on his daily blog that day.
And uh,
and yeah,

749
00:45:35.811 --> 00:45:36.940
our site was just like,

750
00:45:36.970 --> 00:45:39.910
I mean it was like 12,000 visitors in the first 20 minutes.

751
00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:43.420
I have to re he posted that and all he did was just a floor.

752
00:45:43.450 --> 00:45:47.290
Luckily by my brother had like one of our promo cards on them and just floated

753
00:45:47.291 --> 00:45:50.060
that out there.
And we had a ton of traffic.
Um,

754
00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:52.990
and he's a big snowboarder and he does this like street snowboarding thing where

755
00:45:52.991 --> 00:45:57.230
he,
he takes like a,
I don't know,
I think it's like a water ski rope behind,
uh,

756
00:45:57.320 --> 00:46:02.020
a car snowboards around.
So this is like a lot better for that than that.

757
00:46:02.350 --> 00:46:05.050
But uh,
yeah,
he's,
he's kind of the perfect person.

758
00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:07.150
I know that he's really involved with boosted,

759
00:46:07.151 --> 00:46:09.610
so I'm not sure if he has much interest,
but,
um,

760
00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:10.703
<v 2>maybe</v>

761
00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:20.670
<v 0>you said something about traction control and I was wondering if you could say a</v>

762
00:46:20.671 --> 00:46:23.820
few things about the hardware that's inside,

763
00:46:23.821 --> 00:46:27.150
kind of controlling the motor is a little bit.
Yeah,
totally.
Uh,

764
00:46:27.210 --> 00:46:31.920
so the trashing control is remarkably simple.
Uh,
basically,
you know,
when you're,

765
00:46:31.921 --> 00:46:34.380
when you're going around a turn in a car and you start to slide out the,

766
00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:37.140
you know,
slow down those back.
We in kind of,
you know,

767
00:46:37.590 --> 00:46:39.150
lessons that slide out a little bit.

768
00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:41.850
And so what we do is basically the same exact thing.

769
00:46:41.851 --> 00:46:46.830
We're just slowing down the back wheel.
But again,
without being,

770
00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:49.920
you know,
a front end,
the back can kind of change.

771
00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:55.160
And so all who basically we have just a set of positive magnets on one side set

772
00:46:55.561 --> 00:46:59.280
of negative magnets on the other hall sensor.
And you know,

773
00:46:59.281 --> 00:47:01.500
if it's a positive reading,
we know we're going this way.

774
00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:04.890
If it's negative reading,
we know we're going that way.
And then,
um,

775
00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:08.490
if that changes,
you just change the power going to each motor.

776
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.260
It happens in milliseconds and it's remarkably simple.

777
00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:17.730
I just like literally one hall sensor.
Um,

778
00:47:17.850 --> 00:47:21.140
and I actually the,
there's like an organization around,
um,

779
00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:23.990
hall sensors and memes and sensors and,
and they,

780
00:47:24.070 --> 00:47:26.610
they found out somehow we were using that.
And I went and I,

781
00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:30.820
I did a presentation at one of their conferences and they're super excited until

782
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:34.230
they found out I only had one hall sensor in the board.
And there were,

783
00:47:34.231 --> 00:47:36.130
I think a little disappointed they wanted us to buy more

784
00:47:37.930 --> 00:47:41.390
because there were people with Mri machines with thousands of hall sensors and,

785
00:47:41.790 --> 00:47:44.950
and so,
so yeah,
that's kind of unexpected and funny.

786
00:47:58.990 --> 00:48:00.220
<v 5>Hey,
I was just wondering,</v>

787
00:48:00.250 --> 00:48:05.250
have you guys thought at all about maybe this product and the context of how

788
00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:08.030
like escape Bark might evolve?
Um,

789
00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:12.970
and specifically I'm thinking about how skate jumps are very different.

790
00:48:12.971 --> 00:48:16.840
Like a vert is very different than like a proper snowboard kicker,
you know,

791
00:48:16.841 --> 00:48:19.960
the landing and how that works.
And is there any thought of like,

792
00:48:20.110 --> 00:48:24.100
would this kind of a product work in that kind of environment?
Not just in like,

793
00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:25.240
you know,

794
00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:29.800
hitting stare gaps and rails but also more snowboard style jumps?

795
00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:35.200
<v 0>Yeah,
definitely.
So have you ever heard of a pump track?
So it's like these,</v>

796
00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:38.140
this little track that's got these bumps and if you're on a skateboard you can

797
00:48:38.141 --> 00:48:40.810
kind of like pump and keep momentum going around.

798
00:48:40.811 --> 00:48:42.220
We thought those would be great,

799
00:48:42.310 --> 00:48:44.860
but the scale was just far too small as you know,

800
00:48:44.861 --> 00:48:47.830
built for a little skateboard and with snowboarding,
you know,

801
00:48:47.831 --> 00:48:51.710
you've got these massive runs that are like,
you know,
sometimes 10 lanes wide.

802
00:48:51.711 --> 00:48:55.170
Right.
And you know,
carving across those,
I mean it's just,
you know,

803
00:48:55.190 --> 00:49:00.190
it makes your whole day and so there is definitely like a larger scale that

804
00:49:00.371 --> 00:49:04.930
needs to happen with that.
And with a skate park for me,

805
00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:07.990
um,
I like more like flat transition.

806
00:49:07.991 --> 00:49:11.320
So maybe we'll look more like a pyramid rather than like a quarter pipe.

807
00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:14.950
I do find that that that curve,
at least for me,

808
00:49:14.951 --> 00:49:18.580
me and my skills aren't good enough,
but it kind of freaks me out.
Um,

809
00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:20.050
and you know,

810
00:49:20.051 --> 00:49:22.540
I've never really tried that on a snowboard so I couldn't really tell you.

811
00:49:22.541 --> 00:49:25.170
But what I do on snow and what I love doing on this board is,

812
00:49:25.171 --> 00:49:29.380
is more like what would be great as like a pyramid that would be like the size

813
00:49:29.381 --> 00:49:33.460
of this room with huge walls that,
you know,
kind of transition.

814
00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:34.810
Those are super fun.

815
00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:39.870
And I think that definitely some day there will be kind of a park men for these,

816
00:49:40.090 --> 00:49:44.350
but I think it's going to be at a much larger scale just given kind of how

817
00:49:44.351 --> 00:49:46.300
snowboarding works and the fun parts of that.

818
00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:47.953
<v 2>Cool.</v>

819
00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:54.810
<v 0>Yeah.
And on that note,
actually we,
you know,
prospect park in Brooklyn,</v>

820
00:49:54.811 --> 00:49:58.230
I don't know if anybody's ever been there,
but,
um,
it's like a leaf resort.

821
00:49:58.231 --> 00:50:00.590
It's incredible.
Um,
there is a,

822
00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:04.740
a huge loop around the park that's like four to six lanes wide.

823
00:50:04.770 --> 00:50:07.140
That's super fun to carve and,
and get up to speed.

824
00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:11.040
But then there's always little pads in the middle.
And so it's,
it's,

825
00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:15.110
it's very different experience,
you know,
traveling through these little pads and,

826
00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:19.450
and going on the,
the big,
uh,
the big outer ring.
But you know,
that,

827
00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:21.120
that's kind of fun to kind of experience with that.

828
00:50:21.121 --> 00:50:25.040
But when we came to Los Angeles and you know,
we,

829
00:50:25.041 --> 00:50:28.490
we wrote up Griffith Park,
which is one of our favorite runs.

830
00:50:28.491 --> 00:50:30.410
I mean that was an even,

831
00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:35.190
I had never like use the same product and had such a different experience.
Um,

832
00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:38.470
you know,
being on literally the side of a mountain going up that hill,
uh,

833
00:50:38.810 --> 00:50:42.860
to Griffith Park.
And so it's,
uh,
it was,
it just blew our minds.

834
00:50:42.861 --> 00:50:43.700
It was way different.

835
00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:47.030
And I think there's just so many different contexts you can enjoy this board,

836
00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:50.930
but I think that bigger,
wider is really nice.

837
00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:56.870
How easy is it to bring the board on a plane?
Yeah,
so we,
uh,

838
00:50:56.900 --> 00:50:58.790
we designed the batteries so that they're,

839
00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:03.900
they're compliant with Tsa regulations and so I usually carry on the board.

840
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:08.310
Um,
you always have to carry on the battery and the remote control,

841
00:51:08.311 --> 00:51:11.720
since there's a battery inside,
you can check the board if you like.
Um,

842
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:14.450
I've actually carried on to boards.
They were super annoyed,

843
00:51:14.451 --> 00:51:18.230
but they let me through with it.
Um,
and,
and yeah,

844
00:51:18.231 --> 00:51:22.730
just fits in the overhead and a lot of our customers take them everywhere.

845
00:51:22.731 --> 00:51:26.030
And that was,
you know,
a key feature we really had to have.
And,

846
00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:30.200
and that's why you see our battery packs are actually two batteries because the

847
00:51:30.201 --> 00:51:31.430
standard,
the watt hour limit,

848
00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:35.480
we had to split the pack and we can get a lot more mileage and stay under that

849
00:51:35.481 --> 00:51:38.840
limit.
Everybody ready to ride?

850
00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:41.300
Cool.
Let's do it.

851
00:51:43.810 --> 00:51:44.690
<v 2>Pretty sure.</v>
