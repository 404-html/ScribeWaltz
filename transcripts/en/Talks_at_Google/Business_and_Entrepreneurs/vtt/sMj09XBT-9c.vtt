WEBVTT

1
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:09.923
Yeah.

2
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.370
<v 0>So,
um,
before I start my bow,</v>

3
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.440
I will love to ask a few questions just to break the ice.

4
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.540
So when was the last time you got up at two o'clock to go to work.

5
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:24.570
All right.
None of you,

6
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.160
when was the last time you got scouted and to a chassis and late for work?

7
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.810
I don't think it exists in Google.
Right
then.

8
00:00:33.811 --> 00:00:38.490
When was the last time you worked through Christmas Eve?
Christmas Day.

9
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.740
New Year Eve.
New Year day.

10
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:42.610
<v 1>Okay.</v>

11
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.410
<v 0>Not Enough.
Yeah.
And,
and when was the last time you drove over eight hours.</v>

12
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.940
How did that feel?
It sucks.
Right.

13
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.710
And have you tried parking it in emergencies on before?

14
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.580
All right.
We have on the law abiding citizens here.
And uh,

15
00:01:05.581 --> 00:01:08.730
when was the last time you drove through snow and waned?

16
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.120
I did a was when was that

17
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:13.803
<v 1>awesome.</v>

18
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.240
<v 0>Yeah.
I remember when I went to Vegas,
I drove through the Wayne and it was,</v>

19
00:01:18.241 --> 00:01:21.120
I thought I would die and I would never want it to do it again.

20
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.150
But unfortunately,
all of the above,

21
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.250
which we don't have experience with most of the time is our truck drivers life.

22
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.150
My name is Lydia and CEO and cofounder of next trucking.
We call it self,

23
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.070
the Fris trucker central market place where you would connect shippers with

24
00:01:38.071 --> 00:01:42.790
small trucking companies,
own operator or small fleets.
Um,

25
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.270
we're actually a platform that connect a carriers with their preferred a loads

26
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.240
according to their own availabilities though the drivers can drive their

27
00:01:51.241 --> 00:01:55.710
preferred a lotes.
And we start a company in October,
2015,

28
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.410
three years old.
Who are the revenue 100% a year ago,

29
00:01:58.411 --> 00:02:03.411
a year and a this year were they looking at a three x our revenue?

30
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.190
Um,

31
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.190
we are a venture backed a company by a venture firms including sequoia capital

32
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.280
Brachfeld and it will raise the total off 105 $25 million as of today.

33
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.513
<v 1>Okay.</v>

34
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.810
<v 0>So a lot of people without trucking is just the moving goods.
But I actually,</v>

35
00:02:23.811 --> 00:02:28.811
trucking is a huge industry and a 70% of Fred and the US is actually move on the

36
00:02:30.081 --> 00:02:34.250
trucks and the trucking industry has five large segments,

37
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.650
full truck load less than a truck load.

38
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.810
Joe Age is moving into content there from the port to a local warehouse and

39
00:02:41.811 --> 00:02:45.680
intermodal is putting the container on the rail and a small parcel.

40
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.440
So we focused on two segments.

41
00:02:48.441 --> 00:02:53.120
One is pulling the container from the port to local warehouse and the second is

42
00:02:53.121 --> 00:02:57.410
moving the goods from the local warehouse.
Two distribution centers like Amazon,

43
00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.620
Walmart,
target,
et cetera.

44
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.470
The industry is cute but extremely fragmented.
Um,

45
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.480
90% of the trucking companies,
small ones,
most of them have less than six trucks.

46
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.850
Top 50 trucking companies,

47
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.090
only accounts for 16% of the market share.

48
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.080
The largest trucking company,

49
00:03:18.081 --> 00:03:23.081
it only owns 12,000 trucks and is a $9 billion public company.

50
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.500
We have two huge problems in the industry.

51
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.800
One is lack of transparency and no technology.

52
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.320
It's an antiquated industry driver rely on brokers to find them loads.

53
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.580
We have phone calls,
text messages,
emails,
sometimes even facts.

54
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:40.780
It's ridiculous.

55
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.920
I know that and a lot of back and forth negotiations.

56
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.660
Drivers' wants certain loads because they're human beings and a shipper wants

57
00:03:49.661 --> 00:03:53.200
certain lanes to be covered and they wanted to come to an agreement.

58
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.440
It's v a lot involves a lot of phone calls.

59
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.240
So the second is our industry's number one problem is trucker shortage.

60
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.500
I would industry is lack of released 100,000 truck drivers turnover rate 97%

61
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.530
which means every single trucking company needs to change their whole fleet once

62
00:04:13.931 --> 00:04:18.100
a year.
Nobody wants to be a truck driver.
It's a tough lifestyle.

63
00:04:18.101 --> 00:04:20.980
I imagine the other bullet points before that,
you don't want that.

64
00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:22.900
And the the turnover,

65
00:04:22.901 --> 00:04:27.520
that's creates a turnover rate and the also tremors don't get paid that well.

66
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.240
Average truck driver make about $45,000 a year.

67
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.720
Super tough lifestyle.
And a,

68
00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:39.160
another thing that really costs a turn in the truck drivers is really,

69
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.300
we call forced dispatching.
I live in La,

70
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.600
I took a load to Arizona,
I wanted to go home.

71
00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.200
I call all my brokers looking for a back haul.

72
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.040
People give me either low to New York or somewhere else,

73
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.960
nobody can bring me home.
So as a truck driver,
I only have two options.
One,

74
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.070
I backed her home,
basically a hot,
an empty trailer,

75
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.980
I'll lose money or I go to another state.

76
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.040
I'm mind needs to celebrate my daughter's first day,

77
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.160
but too bad I cannot find a bug,
a back haul.

78
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.450
So that's how we create a next trucking,

79
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.310
the first fucker center of marketplace where we design a solution really for

80
00:05:21.311 --> 00:05:24.730
truck drivers and we allow them to come back to with shippers.

81
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:26.710
For the shipper side,

82
00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.770
we allow sure press to access to a large massive database of virtual fleet.

83
00:05:32.261 --> 00:05:33.280
In southern California,

84
00:05:33.281 --> 00:05:37.060
we actually different from a lot of tech startups that are trying to spread the

85
00:05:37.061 --> 00:05:40.660
world.
Where we are trying to do is really,
we call it building the lengths.

86
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:42.050
It's a marketplace.

87
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.120
You want it to make sure your supply meets demand and it's a very fragmented

88
00:05:46.121 --> 00:05:49.960
market.
So when we did is we started with southern California.

89
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.560
We viewed a lot of local capacities and we built lanes,

90
00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:58.010
which means we bring trucks from southern California to northern California to

91
00:05:58.011 --> 00:06:01.340
Arizona,
Texas and Nevada.
So those are the cooling's we viewed.

92
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.110
And also we launched shippers to track and trace the drivers.
Real time.

93
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.600
Google map is so advanced it,

94
00:06:08.601 --> 00:06:13.250
but too bad shippers never know to driver is even till today.

95
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.060
Shippers called broker broker called trucker and ask for the chocolate or

96
00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:19.430
location,
then communicate back to the shipper.

97
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:21.950
Tons of back and forth negotiations.

98
00:06:21.951 --> 00:06:26.570
And the communication is sometimes drivers may lie,
brokers may lie,

99
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.600
right?
So there's really no transparency in that.

100
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:34.910
And also we provide our shippers real time proof of delivery.

101
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.140
It's a little piece of paper.

102
00:06:36.141 --> 00:06:39.450
It was driver's signature and received receivers signature on it,

103
00:06:39.451 --> 00:06:44.000
proving that the load is too the vert.
But in the past or even today,

104
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.130
brokers need to call driver drama.

105
00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:48.710
Bring that piece of paper back to the broker's office,

106
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:53.660
getting the payment and a broker scan that piece of paper and send to shipper.

107
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:58.400
Then they will collect the money.
She grew up collect money from the buyers,

108
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:03.730
but the whole process takes two to four weeks,
which means as a shipper,

109
00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.180
my merchandise got delivered.

110
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.750
I cannot even bill my buyer after four weeks.

111
00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:13.340
Huge cashflow issues for a lot of shippers.
So without solution,

112
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.120
every everything is online.
Everything is.
They just whole lysed.

113
00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:21.200
So shipper can build the buyers the moment the loads get delivered.

114
00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:26.510
And of course we provide EDI and API solution.
Of course a lot.

115
00:07:26.511 --> 00:07:30.620
I remember when I was pitching sequoia capital,
I say we're Edi and API ready.

116
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.690
They were like,
what is Edi?

117
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:36.500
I remember one of the senior partners that,
oh,

118
00:07:36.501 --> 00:07:38.420
that was technology from 20 years ago.

119
00:07:38.421 --> 00:07:40.460
We actually invest in one of those companies,

120
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.060
but too bad we still use this in trucking industry today.

121
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:49.070
So far on the carrier side,
we provide predictive load offering capability.

122
00:07:49.071 --> 00:07:52.340
So basically we studied driver's behavior,
their own preferences,

123
00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:53.840
the availabilities,

124
00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.860
so we can predict the kind of loads that we want it to give to the shippers.

125
00:07:58.460 --> 00:07:59.810
So they don't need to call,

126
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.620
they don't need to negotiate whatever we give to them.
They will accept.

127
00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:08.330
So actually we reduced the time that they spend on negotiating with traditional

128
00:08:08.331 --> 00:08:11.810
brokers.
On top of that,
I would provide fuel events,

129
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:16.400
quick pay and offer a very lightweight web based,

130
00:08:16.401 --> 00:08:17.960
the fleet management software.

131
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.320
And of course I'm top of that and we have walkie talkies on the APP.

132
00:08:21.321 --> 00:08:23.150
They can communicate with other drivers,

133
00:08:23.151 --> 00:08:28.151
really trying to create a community feeling for our drivers in a different from

134
00:08:28.311 --> 00:08:33.020
other texts.
Olives,
as I mentioned,
we are port focused,
we're original focus.

135
00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:35.810
La is the largest port of the whole country.

136
00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:41.590
40% of our merchandise this in this country are important and 30% of them come

137
00:08:41.751 --> 00:08:46.100
into La and Long Beach Port La Represent 15 I'm sorry,

138
00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:48.860
this year is 17 t years.

139
00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:52.100
So Teu is 20 equivalent unit.

140
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:56.100
So it's really a metrics.
We measure how many containers that coming in.

141
00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:00.720
So average content is about 40 footers,
so 20 is like half of containers.

142
00:09:00.721 --> 00:09:05.721
So we're looking at about 8.5 million contenders coming into this point and the

143
00:09:06.841 --> 00:09:10.530
La along is $14 billion shipping business,

144
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.190
so we don't need to even go out to bid on Montebello.
Ended all company here.

145
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:18.980
We created this really program last year.
It's the,

146
00:09:18.981 --> 00:09:21.660
we call it a different kind of dre edge,

147
00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:26.220
so I'm not going to go into the details of this,
but with this solution,

148
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:31.250
it's actually a combination of our virtual fleet asset and marketplace and allow

149
00:09:31.921 --> 00:09:36.921
us to inject additional capacity to drayage and increase of trans I'm trucks in

150
00:09:37.141 --> 00:09:40.950
the terminals.
So for our drainage relay drivers,

151
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:45.210
they on average make 20% more money.
Not necessarily pay them more,

152
00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:49.710
but they are more efficient because right now 40% of a capacity is wasted.

153
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:56.600
And that would go and ambition is really to go to every single port in the US

154
00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:01.710
and the really give the best solution to the port to reduce the congestion at

155
00:10:01.711 --> 00:10:05.310
the terminals to bring in freight and morph a lot faster.

156
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:08.730
And it makes sure the merchandise moves a lot faster.

157
00:10:08.731 --> 00:10:10.670
Shippers will increase the cash flow

158
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:16.650
and why we do this and do what we do.

159
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:21.800
So a lot of people wanting to start up a company because they see the problems.

160
00:10:22.381 --> 00:10:26.520
But a lot of them start a company because they saw the bus ward like blockchain,

161
00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.473
right?

162
00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:32.040
Like AI and people just want to apply technology and something.

163
00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.820
But we are doing,
this is really for a cost.

164
00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:38.250
So this is a real story.

165
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:41.880
Kevin Luke is one of our own operators.

166
00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:44.400
I wanted to give you a little bit background of him.

167
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:47.970
He had a little smaller business a couple years ago.

168
00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:52.970
It's a tax business and he failed miserably and he actually filed a bankruptcy.

169
00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:56.190
He and his wife live on the street,

170
00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:59.970
so he worked for a trucking company going into the terminal every single day.

171
00:10:59.971 --> 00:11:02.820
He really worked hard to save up.

172
00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:08.090
So the moment he saved up a little money to be able to pay for the down payment

173
00:11:08.191 --> 00:11:12.840
for a truck,
he bought his first truck.
He wanted to be an entrepreneur,

174
00:11:12.841 --> 00:11:14.610
so he became own operator.

175
00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:19.680
He went to the terminal every single day.
He worked so many hours a day,

176
00:11:19.681 --> 00:11:23.880
but still he could barely survive.
He found us last year.

177
00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:25.231
And a,

178
00:11:25.231 --> 00:11:30.060
the reason why we found about this story is he came to our office for the mobile

179
00:11:30.061 --> 00:11:32.710
2.0 focus grip and the,

180
00:11:32.711 --> 00:11:37.530
he shared his personal story and he broke down during the focus group.

181
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.870
I wanted to share this video with you.

182
00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.240
<v 2>I got into trucking,</v>

183
00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:47.940
all grandfather was dying from cancer and he kind of passed the torch to me when

184
00:11:47.941 --> 00:11:51.540
I was homeless.
It was duck toughest thing I ever could have been through.

185
00:11:51.541 --> 00:11:55.880
I was actually sleeping in,
uh,
a guy truck.
I was driving,
I,

186
00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:56.591
me and my wife.

187
00:11:56.591 --> 00:12:00.370
So she used to up your wait till I got off 18 hours to get in the bed,

188
00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:09.350
but you pushed through something like that.
What could stop

189
00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:17.970
working for next?

190
00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:23.270
Changed my life dramatically far has given me a lot of time back to spend time

191
00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.830
with the family,
uh,
double my income,
uh,

192
00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:30.160
allowing me to grow my business to another level,
uh,

193
00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:31.920
faster than what I expected.

194
00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:41.920
<v 0>So,
um,</v>

195
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:47.380
so I always told my team because of stories like this,
it's emotional,

196
00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:50.740
it's beautiful,
and we're not just building a mobile app.

197
00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:54.850
We're changing people's life.
It's bigger than what we thought it is.

198
00:12:55.180 --> 00:13:00.180
And also this kept us going and a cap us moving forward because we are literally

199
00:13:00.791 --> 00:13:05.200
changing truck driver's life and a lot of people ask me,
Lydia,
why now?

200
00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:08.860
Why didn't you come up with this solution 10 years ago?
Trucking never change.

201
00:13:08.861 --> 00:13:12.340
And then passed the centuries.
Who fucking never changed?

202
00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.670
It was like that in the past 24 years.

203
00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.410
But logistics was not that important 10 years ago.

204
00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:22.660
I remember 10 years ago,

205
00:13:22.661 --> 00:13:26.830
because my husband has been logistics for a long time and I was actually talking

206
00:13:26.831 --> 00:13:31.150
to some investors,
wanted to raise some money for his small logistics company.

207
00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:35.770
Nobody wanted to talk to us 10 years ago because of the logistics was not sexy

208
00:13:35.771 --> 00:13:39.010
enough.
It's not tech enough.
It's not cool enough.

209
00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:42.880
But 10 years ago,

210
00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.720
international trading companies had thick margins.

211
00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:51.910
So logistic cost is really a fraction of their margin,

212
00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:56.980
but it was the growth of ecommerce and the transparency of the world.

213
00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:01.510
Now it becomes very,
very transparent.
So vendors,

214
00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:04.360
the margin actually decrease the dramatically.

215
00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:08.950
While logistics costs increased that dramatically.
Right now,

216
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:14.430
let's just the cost accounts for 10% off an average vendors margin.

217
00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:17.530
So it become very,
very important.

218
00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:20.650
So now all of a sudden Anna was looking into logistics,

219
00:14:20.651 --> 00:14:23.650
see how we can be more efficient,
how we can save money there.

220
00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:26.320
That's why in the past three years,

221
00:14:26.321 --> 00:14:31.210
millions of dollars got poured into logistics space and according to some youth

222
00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:35.980
and estimate that US companies is going to spend more than two point $5 billion

223
00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:41.250
in disruptive logistics and supply chain technology by 20 2022 and the overall

224
00:14:42.221 --> 00:14:46.840
supply chain logistic tax banding will rise to 87 billon dollars.

225
00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:52.320
So everyone's trying to create a solution to make free shipping painless.

226
00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:57.920
And also there's the fundamental issue with the industry is there's an imbalance

227
00:14:57.921 --> 00:15:01.520
between supply and demand,
right?
We have a lot of freight to move.

228
00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:06.140
I know how many of you purchase on Amazon every single month,

229
00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:11.510
right?
But nowadays what are,
we don't have enough truck drivers.
I would,

230
00:15:11.511 --> 00:15:13.280
truck drivers are not efficient enough,

231
00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:17.060
but they are the fondant foundation of our economy.

232
00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:22.040
So the goal is really to attract capacity back to the industry.

233
00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:27.410
I will average truck drivers ages over 50 so after 10 years,

234
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:31.580
what do we do?
Do we have enough trucks?
How can we move the goods?

235
00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:36.260
So that's the problem that companies like us,
Uber Freight,

236
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:40.250
convoy,
everyone's trying to resolve the problem from different angles.

237
00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:45.560
So people talk about future,
what are we seeing in the future?

238
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
We believe companies like us will replace the traditional brokage technology

239
00:15:52.101 --> 00:15:56.360
platform to really connect.
The shipper was care where it's more efficiently.

240
00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:02.080
And other than that we're looking at to play years really in the trucking space.

241
00:16:02.781 --> 00:16:07.781
One is clean trucks cause carbon emission is re really big problems in the,

242
00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:13.230
especially for the age companies and all the port's really required cling

243
00:16:13.231 --> 00:16:14.064
trucks.

244
00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:19.750
So claim trucking companies like Tesla or Uid in China and also hydrogen

245
00:16:20.421 --> 00:16:21.980
companies like Nicola.

246
00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:27.280
There will be playing major roles in local drayage autonomous is really getting

247
00:16:27.651 --> 00:16:31.010
Dick and uh,
who have a Tesla here.

248
00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:38.630
All right,
who knows way more.
Yes.

249
00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:41.180
So this is really the future.

250
00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:46.270
And companies like startups like to simple Starsky embark in a Google is way

251
00:16:46.851 --> 00:16:48.890
more by do.
Paccar.

252
00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:53.420
Everyone's really looking to autonomous trucks because driving is really a

253
00:16:53.421 --> 00:16:57.020
painful experience for truck drivers,
especially for long haul drivers.

254
00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:01.670
Traditional truck manufacturers like Volvo,
Toyota,
BMW,
Volkswagen.

255
00:17:01.671 --> 00:17:05.090
I know Mercedes have the most expensive autonomous trucks for the,

256
00:17:05.091 --> 00:17:07.190
everyone is looking into the space.

257
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:12.770
So this is what we think that will happen in five years,

258
00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.110
not 10 years,
five years.

259
00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:20.920
So for local trucks we will see a lot of electronic or hydrogen trucks to really

260
00:17:23.001 --> 00:17:25.730
create low emission,
um,

261
00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:28.010
transportation methods.

262
00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:33.250
So it's really from the local warehouse to a yard there in front of the yard,

263
00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:38.480
then to out of state warehouse,
it will go on and,
and Thomas Truck,

264
00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:43.930
because it can really eliminate the burden for the drivers driving long hours

265
00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:47.660
and allow drivers to really only manage exceptions.

266
00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:53.370
Then when the loads are arriving at the local city,
which is a destination,

267
00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:58.230
we'll,
we'll have another local truck that pickup the loads from the yard,

268
00:17:58.500 --> 00:17:59.970
then move to local warehouse.

269
00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:05.220
I predict it will happen in five years and it might be shorter than we expect.

270
00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:11.040
All right.
So my name's Lydia and um,

271
00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:14.940
I was born in Shanghai,
China.
So I'm a pure immigrant.

272
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:19.190
I was the only child,
um,
same as the most,

273
00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:23.340
the people that were born after 1978.
Um,

274
00:18:23.341 --> 00:18:28.230
so I do have some single child,
uh,
symptoms.
Um,
very selfish,

275
00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:33.150
but the best,
the thing is I was really just center of the university,
my family,

276
00:18:33.151 --> 00:18:36.990
and,
and got the best education because education is very important to Chinese

277
00:18:36.991 --> 00:18:37.824
families.

278
00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:41.160
I went to a school called Shanghai foreign languages school where I met.

279
00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:46.370
I met my first American teacher who actually inspired me to come to this country

280
00:18:46.561 --> 00:18:51.090
to pursue my master's degree because I love the freedom that she brought to us.

281
00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.220
I,
she,
she brought the best of classes.

282
00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:57.060
So after graduating from college in China,

283
00:18:57.090 --> 00:19:00.750
I apply for a master's degree in the US.

284
00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:05.250
I applied for several universities and uh,
got accepted by most of them.

285
00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:08.130
I chose to go to Uva because of the ranking.

286
00:19:08.131 --> 00:19:13.080
I really have no idea what the map looks like.
So I'm in awful.

287
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:17.310
Uva actually gave me a teaching assistant scholarship.
Back then.

288
00:19:17.311 --> 00:19:20.700
It was very hard for a Chinese citizen to come to this country study,

289
00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:25.350
especially when you don't have scholarship,
so I have to get scholarship.

290
00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:27.630
So I applied for Italian literature.

291
00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:33.240
I did study Italian and in I got an Italian literature,
um,

292
00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:34.980
teaching assistant scholarship,

293
00:19:34.981 --> 00:19:37.800
which means I had to teach 80 students in Italian,

294
00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:42.000
which is pretty weird for Chinese to teaching Americans Italian,

295
00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:44.010
but it happened to me,

296
00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:49.890
but I really appreciate it my two semesters that Uva because I actually left

297
00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:53.520
after two semesters because I know that I wouldn't want it to be a professor as

298
00:19:53.521 --> 00:19:54.354
a Korea,

299
00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:58.980
but I really got experience as a coaching.

300
00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:04.080
I really got my coaching skills there and I was not afraid of standing on the

301
00:20:04.081 --> 00:20:08.340
stage and speak to the people because I got 80 students down there and ask me

302
00:20:08.341 --> 00:20:11.250
questions all the time and I was less nervous,

303
00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:15.180
a lot more brave and I dare to raise my hand and it questions.

304
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:17.010
I really appreciate that.

305
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:21.750
That's what I learned from Uva and after then I transferred to USC,

306
00:20:21.751 --> 00:20:26.751
pursue my master's degree in communications management because I wanted to be a

307
00:20:27.061 --> 00:20:27.894
journalist.

308
00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:32.760
But obviously it was very hard and my English wasn't even good enough back then.

309
00:20:32.761 --> 00:20:37.470
Even it nowadays it's not the best English.
Then,
um,

310
00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:41.070
after graduation,
obviously couldn't find a job as a journalist.

311
00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:46.020
So I found a job at the,
an ad agency as an account executives.

312
00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:48.900
So job was really talked to the show,

313
00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:52.210
a lot of clients and negotiate contract.

314
00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:57.580
I actually practice my negotiation skills for my first job back then.

315
00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:02.830
And uh,
who,
who's,
who's not good at negotiating chance here?

316
00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:08.830
Alright.
If you're not very good at it,
I recommend a book.

317
00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.740
Never split the difference by Chris Voss.

318
00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:15.940
He was actually a former FPI um,

319
00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:21.220
negotiator for hostage and I,

320
00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:24.380
this book,
it was actually in today's dividing my a sequoia partner.

321
00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:29.320
Oh my homeboy.
He was the founder off ad mob.
He gave me the book,

322
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:34.210
then I read it,
I was inspired and he regretted it because I negotiated with him.

323
00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:38.680
But uh,
yeah,
if you have interested can read this.

324
00:21:38.681 --> 00:21:41.920
It's actually a very interesting book and that's available.

325
00:21:41.921 --> 00:21:44.140
I'm as Amazon and the audio as well.

326
00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:49.930
And after that I started because I was wanting to be an entrepreneur.

327
00:21:49.931 --> 00:21:51.640
I started a few small companies.

328
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.540
I fell to all of them and failed miserably.

329
00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:59.420
The more memorable one was the one I started in China.
Come Nigh,
look,

330
00:21:59.421 --> 00:22:01.390
see it's a flash sale website.

331
00:22:01.391 --> 00:22:04.630
Very similar to guilt because I was really inspired about it.
Guilt,

332
00:22:04.631 --> 00:22:06.040
guilt was really big back then.

333
00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:11.100
So I went there really bravely and abroad,

334
00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:14.680
borrowed the money from my family,
started this little company,

335
00:22:14.681 --> 00:22:19.681
was five people and the my margin was 75% I was selling us merchandises.

336
00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:24.550
I was the first one who brought juicy couture back to China and uh,

337
00:22:24.551 --> 00:22:28.270
the company was profitable after six months.
I was so happy,

338
00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:33.280
but I forgot one thing.
China is competitive.
After few months,

339
00:22:33.281 --> 00:22:37.480
hundreds of flash sale website,
Kim up,
everybody would raise tons of money.

340
00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.340
Nobody wants to make them any money.

341
00:22:39.341 --> 00:22:42.550
I got squeezed out just six months later I got flushed out.

342
00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:46.330
So lesson learned,
there is two things.

343
00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:49.420
Speed is the only competitive advantage.

344
00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:53.170
No matter how good your technology is,
you need to move fast.

345
00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:57.430
No matter how good your team is,
you need to move fast.
Second,

346
00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.640
you need to learn.
If you want it to be in tech,

347
00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:02.980
you need to make sure your company has money.

348
00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:07.150
Fundraising is probably a virtual for a founder.

349
00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:10.000
So learning how to raise money is important.

350
00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:15.280
So here comes the origin and inspirations from next tracking.

351
00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:19.300
It's really from two stories I had because of my background.

352
00:23:19.301 --> 00:23:23.160
I want it to be a journalist,
right?
I never was interesting logistics.

353
00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:24.670
So unsexy sake,

354
00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:28.540
an old man's and big guys and he's 180 pounds or 200 pounds,

355
00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:33.340
so it's very boring to me.
But my husband has been in logistics for 15 years.

356
00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:38.900
So the other day I went to his office,
he actually come pain every single day.

357
00:23:38.901 --> 00:23:41.980
It's like I hate logistics.
Like why are you still in it?
But I hate it.

358
00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:45.130
So I went to his office.
It was chaotic.

359
00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:49.760
Everyone's fighting the dredge.
The drivers were fighting,

360
00:23:49.761 --> 00:23:53.270
that's dispatchers were fighting.
I remember I sat next to a dispatcher,

361
00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:58.070
he spent two hours trying to cover one load.
He pick up the phone,

362
00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:02.030
call five drivers,
trying to find the cheapest one.
He found the cheapest one.

363
00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:03.900
He give low to him and he,

364
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:07.850
he thought I probably can find another cheaper one.

365
00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:11.270
So he caught two more.
Unfortunately he couldn't find a cheaper one,

366
00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:14.180
went back to the other one and the driver dropped the load.

367
00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:19.070
So he has to do all over again the bail and he's trying to lock another driver

368
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:22.880
two hours for low.
Well note,
extremely inefficient.

369
00:24:22.881 --> 00:24:24.650
I find it a pretty amazing,

370
00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:30.220
and a second story is we will actually driving on the freeway the other night

371
00:24:30.741 --> 00:24:34.730
after party,
me and my husband.
So that was a midnight.

372
00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:38.900
So we saw a big rig parking in emergencies zone.

373
00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:42.980
So I was like,
I asked my husband,
I was like,
is he broken down?

374
00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:45.740
Like why is he parking there and he's going to get a ticket.

375
00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:47.600
So my husband was like,

376
00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:51.950
he probably doesn't want to pay $25 truck stop parking fee.

377
00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:56.780
I was shocked.
Those guys worked day and night.

378
00:24:56.930 --> 00:25:01.930
They make Solado and they have to risk their life by parking in an emergency

379
00:25:01.971 --> 00:25:06.950
zone.
Trying to save 25 bucks.
So that really inspired me.

380
00:25:06.951 --> 00:25:11.090
I wanted to do something for them because I see those guys almost every single

381
00:25:11.091 --> 00:25:13.820
day.
They work hard.
They are humble people.

382
00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:17.690
They'd probably not the most sophisticated people,
but they deserve more.

383
00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:22.310
So that's where we come up with inspirations just to help them.

384
00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:28.370
Then we started to understand market and trying to identify where the root

385
00:25:28.371 --> 00:25:32.090
causes.
So here come the ideation.

386
00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:35.570
That's how my process was.
Just a four year in reference.

387
00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:40.780
I interviewed a hundred truck drivers before I came up with this idea and uh,

388
00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:45.380
I got understood their pinpoint,
they share their ideas with me.

389
00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:47.810
I'd be at my first time meeting in three months

390
00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:53.360
and it didn't work.
I,

391
00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:57.020
when we launched the APP in October,

392
00:25:57.020 --> 00:26:01.820
2015 I remember we had 30 users and our idea was like,
okay,

393
00:26:01.821 --> 00:26:02.241
dry,

394
00:26:02.241 --> 00:26:06.290
why don't we write us driving to dictate what they want so they can post their

395
00:26:06.291 --> 00:26:10.130
truck.
So we actually created this post,
the truck function on the APP,

396
00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:13.010
but too bad nobody posts truck.

397
00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:18.020
Everyone download the APP asking for loads because their behavior is what do you

398
00:26:18.021 --> 00:26:22.400
have?
Let me choose.
So we immediately clay and he changed.

399
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:25.610
The idea was switch the gear and say,
okay,
why don't we do this?

400
00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:29.000
Let's post the loads and let them pick.

401
00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:32.990
And then also we need to be really regional focus.
Why?

402
00:26:32.991 --> 00:26:36.860
Because it's such a huge market.
If I onboarding drivers and New York,

403
00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.420
I don't have your loads for them,

404
00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:42.200
they're going to churn and by Amore shippers who want to ship on the lanes,

405
00:26:42.201 --> 00:26:44.430
I don't have drivers,
my ship reward turn.

406
00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:49.200
So then we actually scaled down to really beauty lanes.

407
00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:50.790
Southern California only,

408
00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:54.920
let's onboard southern California home based the drivers.
They had behaviors.

409
00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:59.850
Very simple either I'm local,
I go out,
I come back.
So when we pitched shippers,

410
00:26:59.851 --> 00:27:04.200
we do the exact same thing.
We're very good with those lengths.

411
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:07.110
We have a lot of drivers give those to us.

412
00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:11.870
That's how we really create the matching and the really kept the marketplace

413
00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:15.510
going.
So that's how we evolved.
Tested idea,

414
00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:20.670
learn from our customers.
So a lot of people asking me,
he's like,
Lydia,

415
00:27:20.671 --> 00:27:23.890
your background is pretty weak.
I was of course,
look at this.
It's the worst,

416
00:27:23.891 --> 00:27:27.660
the package for a thought of founder,
right?
I'm an immigrant.

417
00:27:27.661 --> 00:27:31.170
I'm a woman in trucking and I'd get an graduate from Google.

418
00:27:31.171 --> 00:27:33.960
I didn't go to Stanford.
So pretty,

419
00:27:33.961 --> 00:27:38.520
it's like I caught his beautiful irrelevant to silicone valley.
Um,

420
00:27:38.521 --> 00:27:41.610
so it actually took me four months to raise my series day because nobody

421
00:27:41.611 --> 00:27:45.900
believed in me.
Me,
like a lot of vcs ask me,
Lydia,
do you drive a truck?

422
00:27:45.901 --> 00:27:49.440
It was like,
too bad.
I'm too short for that.
Um,

423
00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:52.370
but that's how he started.
And,
uh,

424
00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:57.120
I think there's something in me that kept me going and I wanted to share it with

425
00:27:57.121 --> 00:28:01.410
you if you decide to be a founder.
One day is some strengths that I have.

426
00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:05.660
If you are an average founder like me,
of course you are all graduate from your,

427
00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:08.770
uh,
from Google.
So you do have the one element that's silly.

428
00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:12.700
Cavalli he's looking for.
So,
um,
one trace,

429
00:28:12.701 --> 00:28:16.410
I think I really get as I do have self awareness.

430
00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:20.190
I know my weaknesses,
I know what I'm not good at.

431
00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:25.080
So that's why I wanted to surround myself with the people who have to qualities

432
00:28:25.081 --> 00:28:25.914
I don't have.

433
00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:32.090
So I know I'm not a coder and I'm not a good people manager and I'm probably not

434
00:28:36.091 --> 00:28:38.190
good at communicating ideas.

435
00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:43.560
So I actually co really surrounded myself and Brian the team who are good in

436
00:28:43.561 --> 00:28:46.530
those areas,
who can deliver the message better for me,

437
00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:49.530
who can really be this an awesome product.

438
00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:53.310
And of course I sell all the time,
not only to my customers,

439
00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.080
I sell to the employees as well.

440
00:28:55.710 --> 00:29:00.350
And I'm very scrappy at the very beginning.
We work on folding tables.

441
00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:03.990
I don't know people always talk about garage or even worse,

442
00:29:03.991 --> 00:29:08.580
we don't even have a graduate of folding tables.
Um,
I remember one employee,

443
00:29:08.581 --> 00:29:10.760
actually one of my early point came in.

444
00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:14.070
He actually worked on like folding table the first day and the second,

445
00:29:14.071 --> 00:29:17.250
the way I shouldn't took it away because a,
we have one more person.

446
00:29:17.251 --> 00:29:21.270
So he actually,
he had,
he worked on his labs.
So,
um,

447
00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:22.560
we were very scrappy,

448
00:29:22.561 --> 00:29:26.460
but we shared a one vision and we really wanted to change the truck driver's

449
00:29:26.461 --> 00:29:27.510
life fundamentally.

450
00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:32.070
So it's important to bring the people that share the vision was shared
mentality,

451
00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:36.240
who equally scrappy as yeah.
At the very beginning and be patient.

452
00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:40.620
I was very patient.
We made a lot of mistakes,
but I never gave up.

453
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:42.730
Even when at the very difficult.

454
00:29:42.731 --> 00:29:47.710
Tommy in I think is the end of 2016 when I was reading series,

455
00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:52.270
say we did $11 million first a year for his text object.

456
00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:54.970
It's huge already.
I think we did a great job.

457
00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000
I was very confident when I walked out and went to silicon valley investors.

458
00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:04.390
I got turned down by over 50 investors in literally a few weeks.

459
00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:08.430
It was very disappointing to me.
And uh,

460
00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:13.010
I think after 50 pictures you actually Polish the pitch a little bit better and

461
00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:16.480
your skin grew a little bit thicker.
So,
um,

462
00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:20.470
I didn't give up because at the end of day you've probably only need one.
Yes.

463
00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:26.010
So at the end of 2016 we closed our series day was a Chinese investor called

464
00:30:26.051 --> 00:30:29.080
China credit grip,
whereas a $5 million,
very small money.

465
00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:33.850
And then we kept the growing.
Everybody wore multiple hats.

466
00:30:33.851 --> 00:30:38.530
We worked tirelessly,
uh,
extremely hard.

467
00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:42.730
Um,
I remember during the peak seasons,
everyone works over 12 hours a day.

468
00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:48.130
And then we got a track.
We got really a lot of tractions from silicone valley.

469
00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:52.960
We pick sequoia as our series B investor.
Of course,

470
00:30:52.961 --> 00:30:55.970
the vast investor we can ask for and for secrecy.

471
00:30:56.120 --> 00:31:00.250
And Larry took us 30 days to close a almost a hundred million dollar round.

472
00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:02.590
We only wanted to raise $50 million,
but,

473
00:31:02.591 --> 00:31:07.591
and we ended up actually a raising $97 million and we got Brookfield Onno book

474
00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:10.540
and they're a fantastic strategic investor.

475
00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:15.100
So I think another [inaudible] that have his hustle and ask for help.

476
00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:18.760
When I just to start a company,
I didn't know any vcs.

477
00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:23.200
I literally add every single person that I can possibly find on linkedin.

478
00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:27.100
And I asked for introductions from the people that I don't even know.

479
00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:31.440
That's how I got my first investor.
And then,
um,

480
00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:36.790
I also got all the La founders contacts.
I basically message them and say,
Hey,

481
00:31:36.791 --> 00:31:38.350
I want it to get a coffee with you.

482
00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:41.860
And I wanted to know how you really bring up your company,

483
00:31:41.861 --> 00:31:44.680
what challenges you have,
can you share some experiences with me?

484
00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:45.850
So I made a very,

485
00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:50.500
a group of good friends and who can share experiences with you and of course,

486
00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:53.110
south south,
south,
south to the investors,

487
00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:55.990
sell to the market and sell to your employees.

488
00:31:57.250 --> 00:32:01.270
And one last thing I wanted to mention is company culture is very important.

489
00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:03.520
I know Google has fantastic company cultures,

490
00:32:03.521 --> 00:32:07.900
but for first time founders it's hard to define your company countries.

491
00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:10.300
I didn't even know what it is.
Um,

492
00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:15.420
I remember I went to a sequoia base camp and I was on a car with Scott Cook who

493
00:32:15.911 --> 00:32:20.620
is the founder of intuit.
So I asked,
Kim was like,
Hey,

494
00:32:20.621 --> 00:32:25.060
what is your company culture?
How did you define it?
He gave me one word.

495
00:32:25.061 --> 00:32:28.750
He's like,
you are your company culture.
I was like,
how?

496
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:31.210
What does that mean?
He's like,
you know,

497
00:32:31.211 --> 00:32:35.290
you and your leadership team really defined what a company is.

498
00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:41.170
So after that we actually spend a lot of time trying to form it.

499
00:32:41.171 --> 00:32:45.140
Cultural Committee tried to really come up with our mission,

500
00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:50.230
vision and value and this is our first draft and we know it's going to involve.

501
00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:56.020
So a mission is empowering drivers to work the way they want when they want and

502
00:32:56.061 --> 00:32:57.860
the vision is painless freight.

503
00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:02.750
We want to to acknowledge that free shipping is really painful and we're really

504
00:33:02.751 --> 00:33:05.150
not resolving a rocket science issues.

505
00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:09.560
We are really trying to make the their life a little bit better one step at a

506
00:33:09.561 --> 00:33:13.280
time.
So five values and we have is put the drivers first.

507
00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:18.670
It's very simple to a lot of tech companies basically put your users first at

508
00:33:18.981 --> 00:33:21.170
demonstrate hustle,
passion two way.

509
00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:24.680
I think I'm a very aggressive person even though I'm pretty small,

510
00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:27.350
but I think it carries towards the whole company.

511
00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:31.970
Everyone's very aggressive and we want you to solve a problem,
not symptoms.

512
00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:36.800
This is actually something that most of you will see if you have a company

513
00:33:36.801 --> 00:33:40.400
because of their very beginning.
Everybody was trying to put out fires.

514
00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:45.450
We actually last year spent tons of time trying to putting out fires and we

515
00:33:46.041 --> 00:33:47.900
didn't really look into root costs.

516
00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:52.730
So this is something that we know we made a mistake and we wanted to change that

517
00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:58.270
set and followed true north because especially when you have a business there,

518
00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:03.200
lot of destructions just for us,
you know,
we want it to new dre edge,

519
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:05.480
but we got business full logistics,

520
00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:09.920
other segments where to housing transloading there was a Jew revenues.

521
00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:13.100
This is a real dollars.
Do we want to do this business?

522
00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:17.480
Do we want to sacrifice it?
If you said the true north,
you know,

523
00:34:17.481 --> 00:34:20.960
this is direction you want it to go and you do not want to be distracted.

524
00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:23.810
So it's important you follow that.

525
00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:27.720
And the trust that it seemed a good hands.
Um,

526
00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:32.830
we default to trust that we bring the best to people and that the people will

527
00:34:33.021 --> 00:34:37.970
take the ownership.
So my final words,

528
00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:42.170
recommendations for a first time founder,
if you ever plan to be one,

529
00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:46.240
just to really summarize what I just repeated,
uh,

530
00:34:46.430 --> 00:34:50.830
set myself first is understand market.
And the size,

531
00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:53.740
the dynamic identified a province.

532
00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:57.920
Don't start a company because you think it's fancy,
it's sexy.

533
00:34:57.921 --> 00:35:02.120
And there's a bus ward out there and blockchain and it probably doesn't work

534
00:35:02.121 --> 00:35:05.450
right now for trucking and the tested ideas.

535
00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:09.620
Be Brave to share the ideas.
It's okay.
Nobody can steal it.

536
00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:13.850
If you can execute very well.
Learn from your customers.

537
00:35:13.851 --> 00:35:17.930
We put ourself in Linwood.
It's not like the beautiful van is beach.

538
00:35:17.931 --> 00:35:20.270
She has a Santa Monica.
We're in the ghetto.

539
00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:23.970
And I remember some investor talk to me and I said,

540
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.780
always your office because they are coming to visit us.
I was like,
oh,

541
00:35:26.781 --> 00:35:30.950
we're in the Gat or just be aware.
Okay.
And they can be in the video.
No joke.

542
00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:35.450
You're straight outta Compton.
So we're literally like north of content.
Um,

543
00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:39.030
but we're close to our users were literally next how truck drivers.

544
00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:43.060
So we can talk to them on a daily basis and uh,
um,

545
00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:48.030
be scrappy.
The very beginning,
unless you were multimillionaires,

546
00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:50.940
you cannot afford to build a large team,
the best team.

547
00:35:50.970 --> 00:35:52.380
You probably need to be scrappy.

548
00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:57.560
It probably wanted to do everything yourself and be patient and never give up

549
00:35:58.110 --> 00:35:59.580
and it's easy to give up,

550
00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:03.600
but you know you will have the light at the end of the tunnel.

551
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:07.920
It will keep you moving and the work extremely hard.

552
00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:13.140
This is no brainer.
You just have to enter your founder Hassan,
ask for help.

553
00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:15.660
Don't be shy.
It's okay to ask for help.

554
00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:19.410
They are a lot of founders like us and when we started and we didn't know what

555
00:36:19.411 --> 00:36:20.420
to do and,

556
00:36:20.421 --> 00:36:24.780
and we always were willing to share experience because we walked the road.

557
00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:29.220
We know how difficult it is and a defined company conscious early.

558
00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:32.580
That's the mistake that most companies make.
I did too.

559
00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:35.880
I didn't really know my company conscious and we just push forward,

560
00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:37.410
drive the revenues,

561
00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:41.340
make the APP work and the Butte internal efficiencies,

562
00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:45.720
but that we didn't know what our company conscious stillness here last as a

563
00:36:45.721 --> 00:36:50.640
founder,
I was to be your best salesman,
salesman for your team sales man,

564
00:36:50.641 --> 00:36:53.940
for your culture and sales man for your company vision.
Well,

565
00:36:53.941 --> 00:36:55.380
thank you so much for your time.
