1
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.630
Please welcome to Google and Arbor Senior Vice President of marketing,

2
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.390
Tony and Rosa.
Yeah,

3
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.480
<v 1>you're going away.</v>

4
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.530
<v 0>Thank you for the warm welcome everyone.</v>

5
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.370
I mean I do know why you really are here.
We had to bring the eighteens,

6
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.080
our famous beanie.
So,
uh,
we're uh,
we're excited to see all of you sporting it.

7
00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:32.860
I live around Ann Arbor,
so I'll be looking for those beanies,
uh,
throughout town.

8
00:00:32.861 --> 00:00:36.870
So thank you again for coming.
Um,
before I kick off with the whole presentation,

9
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.890
I have strategically placed videos in here to make sure you all stay awake cause

10
00:00:40.891 --> 00:00:44.700
it is,
you know,
that one to two o'clock witching hour after lunch.
Um,

11
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.240
but the first one is really to bring the life,
hopefully for many of you,

12
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.120
the true spirit and essence of what we're all about.

13
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.840
It's a recent film that we produced in partnership with Jason Momoa.

14
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.110
So if a few of you may know who he is,

15
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.690
pretty famous for different roles and lead leading parts,
he's,
uh,

16
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.770
been able to secure and we have been very fortunate to be become close friends

17
00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:08.820
with him over the last three and a half years.

18
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.680
He's directed and produced a four of our last commercials and he grew up in Iowa

19
00:01:13.681 --> 00:01:18.120
Kid,
uh,
you know,
and,
and the son of a single mom,
um,

20
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.990
and raised by his grandfathers who were farmers and carpenters as well.

21
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.460
So I'm gonna kick things off with the film that we did in partnership with Jason

22
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.660
that really speaks to the power of building a legacy for that next generation.

23
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.923
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

24
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.360
<v 0>Ever since I was a little boy,
always wanted to be a father,</v>

25
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.630
but never in my life did I ever think that would be an actor.

26
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.310
I was raised in small town America,
surrounded by hard work,

27
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.780
cornfields and pigs.

28
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.580
My uncles and grandfather were the hunters and builders of the Midwest.

29
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.640
I was raised by a strong single mother.
My Mom's an artist in every way.

30
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.890
She's a painter and a photographer.
So water,

31
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.710
always searching,
always seeing,

32
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.740
I guess you could say my mom came your eyes.

33
00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.970
My mom introduced me to skateboarding and rock climbing.

34
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.280
I have solutely love her for that.
Just keyboarding.

35
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.250
It gave birth to a style

36
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.060
<v 3>for me.
It wasn't just the skating,
it was the music.</v>

37
00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.210
It was the crew.
The underground
architecture was forever changed.

38
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.600
You wouldn't believe how much fun you could have on a curb

39
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:18.503
and climbing.

40
00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.300
It made me face my fears and my doubts or the impossibles problem.

41
00:03:24.301 --> 00:03:28.740
Solve through movement.
I'm going to trust my hands,
find my feet,

42
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.280
but on balance can I found my passion.

43
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.370
I want her to see the world climbing
a crazy road at the wild,

44
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.880
wanting to get out,
explored all

45
00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.570
camping fires,
playing music,
tone stories,
living in the dirt,

46
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.300
in crackers and sardines
cause a dirt bag.

47
00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.910
It's not a Carolyn world.

48
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.650
Back to my life.
I put it on my back.

49
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.890
Free to wander everywhere from Tibet,
France,
Italy,
Japan,

50
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.060
everywhere you were,

51
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:19.640
my travels made me a student of life.

52
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.870
Somehow that path led me to a crossroads and at the end of that road acting

53
00:04:28.871 --> 00:04:31.630
cornered,
she seduced me

54
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.570
for an anxious young man at finally allowed me to be anything that I wanted to

55
00:04:37.571 --> 00:04:42.010
be.
The wanderlust,

56
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.870
gave way to direction and purpose

57
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.120
can be a barbarian bartender.

58
00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.080
The savage Cole are the king of Atlantis.

59
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.630
19 years I've been doing this.

60
00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.140
I'm an actor or director at right in the produce.

61
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.070
I found my path,
craftsmen,

62
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.780
my craft of storytelling,
and then it happened.

63
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.900
She came my muse,
the love of my life,

64
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.570
my partner in crime,
I felt stupid,
crazy,

65
00:05:26.571 --> 00:05:31.460
madly in love with her.
My wife gave me three beautiful feral kids,

66
00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.210
Zo bear,
Lola bear,

67
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.960
and the wolf
in with them.

68
00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:46.160
Dreams finally came true.
I'm a father.

69
00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.260
I found my place.

70
00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:58.100
I like any father.
We want our children to see us doing what we love,

71
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:05.240
but now my passion for storytelling pulls me away for long periods of time

72
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:08.593
and that scares me.

73
00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.680
The nomadic lifestyle that wants inspired me and now it takes me away from the

74
00:06:13.681 --> 00:06:14.640
things that I love most.

75
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.400
The family
I'm afraid of.

76
00:06:22.401 --> 00:06:25.460
What I'm going to miss last Christ.

77
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.700
Be able to help them teach them.

78
00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:35.810
I don't want to miss those moments.
If I think about it

79
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.930
in five more years,
five summers,

80
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:43.930
I'm not the center of the universe.

81
00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:55.120
I decided to surround my children's who I am.
Music painting.

82
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.860
All my art forms
spite.
Teach them to escape.

83
00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.080
Then they can serve for snowboard,

84
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.240
ultimate balance,
bold and brave in any terrain.

85
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:14.410
If I teach them to climb
and they can push themselves to the limits,

86
00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:16.870
gracefully move through fear and doubt

87
00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.220
to learn respect for our natural resources.

88
00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.040
Cause if they can admire nature's truest colors,
making,

89
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:34.460
begin to see the beauty in all things,

90
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.600
to be aware of those and conspicuous and overlooked details of life.

91
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:44.060
I want to give them my eyes.
They will know art,

92
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:48.770
paint,
sculpt,
don't understand light and darkness and composition.

93
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:52.610
Find their soul.
That's what the music lives.

94
00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:59.090
Teach them to play because if they can play the consent,
if they can sing,

95
00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:02.720
did you dance?
When you dance,
you celebrate.

96
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:08.240
It is both
these lessons.

97
00:08:08.241 --> 00:08:11.930
We teach them expression itself,
and

98
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.000
if I build it,
I can teach them hard work,

99
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:21.380
dedication,
integrity,
moral code.

100
00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:27.100
Now,
every time my children play,
they can feel it.

101
00:08:27.101 --> 00:08:28.430
The pump was always with them.

102
00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:38.850
Since the moment I left my mother's house to the moment that I built a home with

103
00:08:38.851 --> 00:08:42.110
my wife
from the ultimate highs,

104
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.300
the lows,
it brought me to my knees.

105
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:48.660
There has been one constant,

106
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:52.390
something that stayed with me through all of this

107
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:55.913
<v 4>on the road.</v>

108
00:08:58.130 --> 00:08:59.360
<v 0>Comfort,
disguise as arm.</v>

109
00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:04.830
<v 3>I see it every time that I looked down at these pants,</v>

110
00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:07.840
my battlefield

111
00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:13.480
from the paint to the stitches,

112
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:19.020
every scratch laughs and cries recorded in these pants.

113
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:25.590
Every mark is a memory.
Every tear adds up to life.
I always wanted to live.

114
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:30.780
Everything I am is in these pants

115
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:37.820
and there will come a day
I'll be gone.

116
00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:39.853
My children,

117
00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:43.160
<v 0>my grandchildren,</v>

118
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:49.070
they will find these beat up old car in a dusty corner somewhere and they will

119
00:09:50.481 --> 00:09:54.810
know
this is the canvas of my life.

120
00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:57.023
<v 1>Ooh,</v>

121
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.150
<v 0>that's a story.</v>

122
00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:08.220
I was authentically inspired by the fact that he absolutely loves and those
pants

123
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:14.880
all the time.
He's wanted to tell a story about them and,
and it,

124
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.840
and it morphed through the relationship we had with him and to being really a

125
00:10:18.841 --> 00:10:22.110
story about the legacy he wants to leave for his kids.

126
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:26.190
The idea that he doesn't want his kids to just know him as this,
you know,

127
00:10:26.191 --> 00:10:29.550
crazy actor in superhero.
He wants to teach them,
you know,

128
00:10:29.551 --> 00:10:33.540
to the responsibility he wants to teach them to enjoy making and creating.

129
00:10:33.541 --> 00:10:36.900
He doesn't want them to grow up in this crazy Hollywood bubble.
You know,

130
00:10:36.901 --> 00:10:39.480
where they're now out of touch with reality.
And the,

131
00:10:39.481 --> 00:10:43.320
and the coolest part of all was he gave us the opportunity and the platform to

132
00:10:43.321 --> 00:10:48.120
tell a story that our consumer has been sending to Carhartt for over a hundred

133
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:52.020
years.
We have pants,
Bibs,
coats,

134
00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:57.260
framed on our walls with letters written by the people who say often that they

135
00:10:57.631 --> 00:11:02.010
had to return it to the maker because they couldn't dare to throw it away.

136
00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:07.820
And usually it's because the wife forced them to get rid of it along the way as

137
00:11:08.581 --> 00:11:09.420
well.
And,

138
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:13.170
and so it was awesome to have a partner in Jason Momoa who could authentically

139
00:11:13.171 --> 00:11:14.190
tell this story,

140
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:18.900
which is a story that are hardworking consumers have been telling for

141
00:11:18.901 --> 00:11:23.330
generations.
And being that we're a family run business,
you know,

142
00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:28.340
founded by a person by the name of Hamilton Carhartt in 1889 here in Michigan.

143
00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:33.030
For those of you who don't know,
we are local.
Um,
you know,

144
00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:37.890
it's a pretty powerful opportunity to be a part of a company that still owned

145
00:11:37.891 --> 00:11:42.810
and operated by the founding family and we still are guided by this man's

146
00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:47.040
principles and his vision and his beliefs.
You know,

147
00:11:47.041 --> 00:11:51.960
that that long before anybody ever really focused on the story behind the

148
00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:56.080
garment,
he was telling it.
Now it's common place,
right?

149
00:11:56.081 --> 00:11:58.150
Everybody wants to know the deeper story.

150
00:11:58.151 --> 00:12:00.970
They want to see the whole story behind the brand.

151
00:12:00.971 --> 00:12:05.380
They believe in while he was communicating and sharing this point of view when

152
00:12:05.381 --> 00:12:09.340
for instance,
child labor was a big issue in the clothing industry.

153
00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:11.380
He was taking a stand against it.

154
00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:16.330
He was making product up to a standard for people who did blue collar trades and

155
00:12:16.331 --> 00:12:21.331
work who traditionally wore rags that were stitched together and sewn by wives

156
00:12:22.781 --> 00:12:25.780
or mothers.
He said there's gotta be a better garment.

157
00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:28.300
There has to be a better way to make it.

158
00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:32.920
These people should have hard rugged clothing that works for the job.

159
00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:37.480
So long before we had this cool athleisure trend where everybody's running

160
00:12:37.481 --> 00:12:41.770
around and you know Nike or under Armour or Lulu lemon or any other brand,

161
00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:47.010
he was making purpose built product for folks that most people have ignored for

162
00:12:48.791 --> 00:12:51.460
decades.
He cared when others didn't.

163
00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:55.390
And these are still the values that we live by today.

164
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:57.880
A lot of these values people are like,

165
00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:01.480
well it sounds like a millennial mindset study that somebody had to come up
with.

166
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:04.570
Right.
And I just laugh about it because I'm always like,

167
00:13:04.571 --> 00:13:07.920
whenever I'm in those meetings I'm like cause I'm an actor.

168
00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:10.930
I don't know if there are any extras in here.
Probably most folks are blaming.

169
00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:11.950
Oh phew.
Thank you.

170
00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:15.850
It's good to see a few excerpts cause we're the forgotten generation.
Right?

171
00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:17.890
Or the skipped over one.
You know,

172
00:13:17.891 --> 00:13:21.610
you've got the big boomers and the big millennials.
Um,
but uh,

173
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:25.510
I always didn't like,
I'm kind of like mad.
Like they are like,
well,
you know,

174
00:13:25.511 --> 00:13:27.400
millennials,
they love authentic brands.
I'm like,

175
00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:30.440
did exercise where we like all about fake ones?

176
00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:36.760
Like why is this so like,
why is it such a big insight?
I don't get it.

177
00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:41.140
But this is our founder,
Hamilton Carhartt,
you know,
and,

178
00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:45.250
and we still see it now today.
I mean,
these are pictures people send to us.

179
00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:50.050
I have had the great pleasure to learn and work with really smart people at big

180
00:13:50.051 --> 00:13:53.230
brands in,
a lot of people really want to talk about all the time on the news.

181
00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:58.510
I didn't get things like this.
Never hardly.
I mean never.

182
00:13:58.870 --> 00:13:59.740
I can guarantee it.

183
00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:04.030
And when their sneakers wore out or their base layer started get stinky,

184
00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.940
like everybody knows that polyester stuff can do right.

185
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.710
They didn't mail it back to us.
I'm the other,
unless they wanted to replace me,

186
00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:15.640
you know?
And that's what we have here,
which is incredible.
You know,

187
00:14:15.641 --> 00:14:18.640
and building off of what you just saw,
you know,
for Jason Momoa,

188
00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:19.900
I mean this is one of the,

189
00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:23.170
one of the letters I always like to bring this one out because those overalls,

190
00:14:23.171 --> 00:14:25.110
I mean this is one stingy farmer,
but if you,

191
00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:26.980
any of you ever grew up in a farming family,

192
00:14:26.981 --> 00:14:31.510
you recognize the value of money and their ability to make something last in the

193
00:14:31.511 --> 00:14:34.240
f and the simple.
If you can't read the fine print.

194
00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:39.100
The simple story here is these bibs outlived his wife who's mended them for

195
00:14:39.101 --> 00:14:43.090
years.
They outlived his neighbor who decided to start bending them for him.

196
00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:44.670
So he finally was like,
well,

197
00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:47.950
I guess I've got to send them back and get some new ones finally,
you know?

198
00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:48.811
But it's,

199
00:14:48.811 --> 00:14:53.750
it's just that incredible relationship that happens with people and the product

200
00:14:53.751 --> 00:14:55.940
that they were because of all the things they do in it.

201
00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:00.140
And this has guided us on a mission that,
that really,

202
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:02.800
it's still a continuation of our,
our,

203
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:06.010
our founder Hamilton with a mark filleted who's the,

204
00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:10.610
the fourth generation family member.
And CEO,
I'm still today.
Um,

205
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.730
and that is we exist to create and build and during products to serve and

206
00:15:13.731 --> 00:15:15.170
protect hardworking people.

207
00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:21.130
Now probably a few people that have like Simon Sinek readers or viewers or

208
00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:26.570
protagonists antagonists,
I'm sure somewhere along the line.
Um,

209
00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:28.790
but if you think about it,
you know,
it is,

210
00:15:28.791 --> 00:15:32.450
it is rooted in a simple why for cart that was started with Hamilton,

211
00:15:32.451 --> 00:15:34.100
which is the belief and hard work.

212
00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:39.320
Hampton Carhartt had a quote and I have to read it from my,
my notes here.

213
00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:43.160
Work is the thing,
good earnest,
honest,
hard work in the right direction.

214
00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:46.280
Everlastingly persistently,
continuously work.

215
00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:50.540
Making good is merely a matter of exerting sufficient energy.

216
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:54.110
Certainly the pros of the day,
we're a little different than what we have today,

217
00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:56.300
but the simple fact is this,

218
00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:00.830
he appreciated hard work and that's what we still do today.

219
00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:06.230
And it doesn't have to be in the form of somebody swinging a giant kick acts or

220
00:16:06.231 --> 00:16:08.900
sludge hammer for us to appreciate it as well.

221
00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:14.170
We appreciate the hard work of a Jason Mamoa and the lifestyle he leads.

222
00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:18.710
And that's who we invite into this brand for the values we stand for.

223
00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:23.750
So I often hear how this brand is being embraced by folks who typically wouldn't

224
00:16:23.751 --> 00:16:26.990
be seen wearing it over the last five or six years.
That's great.

225
00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:28.243
That's really good.

226
00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:31.940
But we're not changing our values and we're not changing who we are all about,

227
00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:36.890
but we're certainly willing to open up the umbrella as we share the story of

228
00:16:36.891 --> 00:16:41.030
what car it stands for now.
Now why,
why,

229
00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:44.540
why has all this happened?
I mean,
some folks have asked over the last few years,

230
00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.640
you know,
you start to see cart more and more.
Well,

231
00:16:46.641 --> 00:16:49.760
some of it is we have great partners like downtown home and garden who sold a

232
00:16:49.761 --> 00:16:54.230
Beautiful Dog Chore Coat Down there that's probably being worn.
You know,

233
00:16:54.231 --> 00:16:55.580
it's nice to have partners,
you know,

234
00:16:55.581 --> 00:16:58.760
because your retailers are a big part of this story.
Um,

235
00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:02.480
when I had the opportunity to come back home,
I grew up in the Midwest.

236
00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:07.280
I grew up in Ohio,
two hours away,
a big fan of the lions,

237
00:17:07.281 --> 00:17:12.080
the Tigers and the Redwings.
And uh,
you know,
my grandfather's were blue collar.

238
00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:16.460
They worked in a industry machine shops.
They wore bibs,

239
00:17:16.461 --> 00:17:17.840
they had the metal lunch pails.

240
00:17:17.841 --> 00:17:21.290
I'll never forget that my parents were there if the first generation in their

241
00:17:21.291 --> 00:17:23.120
family to actually get a college degree.

242
00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:27.140
And like most families of the day they wanted to teaching because that was

243
00:17:27.141 --> 00:17:30.500
really the profession that they knew to pursue.
Um,
afterwards.

244
00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:33.410
And I grew up with this,
I did construction jobs.

245
00:17:33.411 --> 00:17:37.910
And so the opportunity to be a part of a brand like this was amazing.
But first,

246
00:17:37.911 --> 00:17:42.050
the first thing we did was we were like,
we have to spend time with our consumer.

247
00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:45.140
Who are these people?
What makes them special?

248
00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:49.320
Because I went from having an opportunity to sell something that more people to

249
00:17:49.321 --> 00:17:52.780
want to fight about outside of politics,
but I'm not touching that now.
Yeah.

250
00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:57.720
And that is your favorite sports team,
right?
Living in Ann Arbor.

251
00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:01.350
There's a lot of conversation around that at the college level,
right?

252
00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:06.630
If you're in Europe,
try arguing over your favorite football club or soccer club.

253
00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:08.490
As you may know,
right?

254
00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:12.960
There are families that are divided and never talked to each other again because

255
00:18:12.961 --> 00:18:16.440
of these feuds,
right?
That's a passion for work.

256
00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:21.270
That's a four letter word that most people are happy to forget about the moment

257
00:18:21.271 --> 00:18:22.860
they're done with it,
right?

258
00:18:22.861 --> 00:18:27.030
So it's hard to market and inspire through that unless you really understand why

259
00:18:27.031 --> 00:18:30.960
they do it,
you know?
And that's what we found was,
wow,
they have stories to tell.

260
00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:34.480
They have a lot of stories to tell.
Really interesting ones.
Um,

261
00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:38.640
and what we started to learn more and more is they believe in this notion that

262
00:18:38.641 --> 00:18:41.790
by working you earn the ability to build a better life.

263
00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:47.250
They believe that making something with your hands is far greater than sitting

264
00:18:47.251 --> 00:18:48.750
in a room like I'm sitting in today.

265
00:18:48.751 --> 00:18:52.740
Because what I get to say I made today was a really neat keynote presentation

266
00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:56.420
that hopefully kept you awake for an hour,
right?
So that's what I teach.

267
00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.230
That's what I'll tell my kids today.
When do we,
you know,

268
00:18:58.231 --> 00:19:00.540
when I see you this evening,
what did you do today,
dad?
Well,

269
00:19:00.541 --> 00:19:01.440
that's what I did today.

270
00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:05.100
What they value is the ability to say at the end of their day they made

271
00:19:05.101 --> 00:19:09.900
something or they made many things or they built a building and that building

272
00:19:09.901 --> 00:19:12.600
will forever be something they can identify with.

273
00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:16.830
And we heard that over and over again.
They like to make beer.
Thank God they do.

274
00:19:16.831 --> 00:19:19.410
I love craft beer and I love being in Michigan,
you know?

275
00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:22.860
But that's somebody who's a maker,
you know?
And we appreciate those folks,

276
00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.350
you know?
And we recognize something early on too.

277
00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:29.850
They said something that I immediately just kind of jumped out of my seat when I

278
00:19:29.851 --> 00:19:32.790
heard it.
They think with their hands.

279
00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:36.940
So in a company like Google,
it's interesting to share that perspective,
right?

280
00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:40.290
Because some of the brightest minds on the planet all work at Google.

281
00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:41.970
I hear about it from my friends.

282
00:19:41.971 --> 00:19:45.480
I went to college in New York City investment banks were scooping up all the

283
00:19:45.481 --> 00:19:49.260
mines.
Then now my buddy who's a partner at BFA says,
yeah,

284
00:19:49.261 --> 00:19:52.740
Google takes all the best ones now,
you know,
and it's true.

285
00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:57.180
But imagine though,
how good are your hands?
Mine aren't that good.

286
00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:02.370
My hands can't really make very much.
They have not a tight,
you know,

287
00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.390
they're pretty good at that.

288
00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:07.470
My wife will remind you all the jobs that I tried to take on at home and how

289
00:20:07.471 --> 00:20:08.700
poorly I do with those.

290
00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:11.460
And then I give up and I hire somebody actually knows how to think with their

291
00:20:11.461 --> 00:20:14.700
hands,
but it's an appreciation for that fact,
you know?

292
00:20:14.701 --> 00:20:17.680
And that's a powerful appreciation,
you know?
And,

293
00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:18.990
and we spend a lot of time with them.

294
00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:24.060
We have a team right now who's been on the road,
God bless them for over 25 days,

295
00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:29.660
shooting and capturing film and photography and story after story that we're

296
00:20:30.901 --> 00:20:33.150
going to bring to life this fall and holiday.

297
00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:37.440
They were just in the upper peninsula with outside magazine because what we

298
00:20:37.441 --> 00:20:41.010
found is if you're a brand that actually tells really interesting stories,

299
00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:46.320
you don't have to pay to tell them.
That was the whole Jason Momoa film.

300
00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:49.960
We're over 70 million impressions and growing and that eight and a half minute

301
00:20:49.961 --> 00:20:52.060
film,
which blew away all the rules.
But let me tell you,

302
00:20:52.061 --> 00:20:53.290
he was not going to change it.

303
00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:59.130
You can negotiate with cal Drago all you one we did right?

304
00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:03.430
And,
and the view view rate is crazy.
Full view rate is crazy.

305
00:21:03.431 --> 00:21:05.260
And you guys I know can run all the stats on Youtube,

306
00:21:05.261 --> 00:21:07.060
but we ran it across all platforms too.

307
00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:11.290
But you would see it's breaking rules when you have an interesting real

308
00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:15.490
meaningful story,
people want to cover it,
editors want to write about it.

309
00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:20.590
So we're up there with outside magazine in the Upp telling stories about some of

310
00:21:20.591 --> 00:21:23.900
the,
the Ski Lodge in a ski,
um,

311
00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:27.070
mountains up in that,
what is it?

312
00:21:27.071 --> 00:21:31.330
The Horn of the EOP.
Pretty amazing.

313
00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:32.830
You know when you can do that.

314
00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:37.720
But it's how you break through because we don't have a Ford Motor Company budget

315
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:40.120
when it comes to advertising,
right?

316
00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:44.470
So our goal is we need to tell stories that are actually interesting and

317
00:21:44.471 --> 00:21:48.250
inspiring.
Not that they don't,
but we really have to break through.

318
00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:50.410
So we spend a lot of time with them.

319
00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:54.220
We start to understand their personas and we've understood one thing loud and

320
00:21:54.221 --> 00:21:54.880
clear.

321
00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:59.800
You know that the car isn't just an outdoor outerwear brand that you wear when

322
00:21:59.801 --> 00:22:04.600
it's cold.
It epitomizes an outdoor orientation towards life.

323
00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:07.780
That's your route.
They don't just go outside.

324
00:22:07.781 --> 00:22:10.750
We don't just go outside when it's cold out with Carhartt,

325
00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:15.880
we go sound all year long as not just for men,
contrary to popular belief,

326
00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:20.200
but we have a long way to go cause we have 100 and some years being for men.

327
00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:24.820
Even though through the years we outfitted Rosie the riveter,
Lo and behold,

328
00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:27.780
um,
and we've done things with women.
Um,

329
00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:30.940
historically we've had a women's line now for about,

330
00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:35.350
I've got a few folks here from work 10 years,
Lindy,
2007,

331
00:22:35.351 --> 00:22:37.090
so 10 years,
10 years.

332
00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:40.840
And we're going to be celebrating women in a slightly bigger way this year.

333
00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:44.860
We've got a few interesting stories we want to tell and we're going to bring

334
00:22:44.861 --> 00:22:48.880
those to life because we always hear after every video or commercial we run or

335
00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:53.470
piece of a advertising,
you know,
from a lot of women who say,
Hey,

336
00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:57.940
I'm a welder.
Why won't you tell my story?
You know,

337
00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:01.540
I work just as hard.
I do a better job.

338
00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:05.050
And we're like,
we're not here to say you don't.

339
00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:10.160
Our problem is first and foremost with women's product,
um,

340
00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:14.950
it's not readily available outside of a few destinations online in a few stores

341
00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:15.963
and brick and mortar.

342
00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:20.060
So thank God for Google because you can help them find us now.
You know?

343
00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:23.590
And that's one of the big opportunities,
you know,
a lot of us,

344
00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:24.670
a lot of people keep saying to,

345
00:23:24.671 --> 00:23:27.140
what are you doing around the millennial millennium?
Millennials?
Like,
Hey,

346
00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:28.900
what are we doing?

347
00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:33.850
We're just being who we are and we're celebrating craft and making and doing,

348
00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:38.320
which just happens to coincide with what that mindset cares about.

349
00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:42.910
You know?
And that's,
that's what we're doing.
But we're being who we are.

350
00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:47.750
We're not trying to be a different company,
you know,
by any stretch.

351
00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:53.170
We also have a fantastically growing opportunity with the Hispanic consumer and

352
00:23:54.231 --> 00:23:55.820
they're growing presence in America.

353
00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:59.930
And how that's changing the face of hard work.

354
00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:03.170
We're not here to be exclusive hard work.
It's hard work.

355
00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:07.710
And that's what we're for no matter what the rules of engagement are.
And,

356
00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:10.190
and that's something that we are spending more and more time,

357
00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:13.760
better understanding and building upon as well.

358
00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.720
But we also know it can't be just about work all the time.

359
00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:22.850
If there's one thing that we like to joke about,
his beer barbecues,

360
00:24:22.851 --> 00:24:25.790
beef and buddies,
the four B's,

361
00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:29.040
the post work activities and,

362
00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:33.540
and really capturing that in their lives,
right?
So,

363
00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:37.400
so we spend a lot of time and we've got personas,
you know,

364
00:24:37.401 --> 00:24:41.210
we can sit down with your team,
but I know your team has them.
You know,

365
00:24:41.211 --> 00:24:44.450
we have four personas that we really focus on and build around.

366
00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:49.370
And those are the four we think about all the time,
you know.
So again,

367
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:53.440
because like our,
our founder,
we believe in the legacy of hard work.
And,

368
00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.250
and really,
you know,

369
00:24:55.251 --> 00:25:00.080
we're embracing this to get people to recognize that we're not just for the

370
00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:02.360
person who swings the sledge hammer.

371
00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:05.240
So all of you are going to have a nice 18 you know,

372
00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:10.040
but the idea here is you shouldn't feel,
oh,
I'm not really like I'm not,

373
00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:14.120
I'm not the car guy or girl.
Well you can be,

374
00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:18.830
it depends on your mindset quite honestly.
It really does.
You know?
And,

375
00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:22.070
and that's what we're shifting a little bit,
you know,

376
00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:27.100
not just that brand that makes work where it's the brand that stands for hard

377
00:25:27.801 --> 00:25:31.850
work and hard working people.
Right.
Little shift,
not a big one,

378
00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:36.290
you know?
And,
and then how do you make work interesting and cool and fun?

379
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:40.640
We got to really interesting places,
rugged corners of the earth.

380
00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:45.440
We call them where the folks rely on card to get the job done and sometimes

381
00:25:45.441 --> 00:25:48.890
survive.
It makes work a little more heroic,
more interesting.

382
00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:51.770
But we also spend a lot of time with them,
camping,

383
00:25:51.771 --> 00:25:56.771
fishing and hiking and hunting because we know that that is an absolute passion

384
00:25:56.841 --> 00:26:00.920
place for them throughout the year.
But when we think about these activities,

385
00:26:00.921 --> 00:26:05.390
like hunting for instance,
it's not about,
you know,
a lot of people,

386
00:26:05.391 --> 00:26:08.300
it's like the trophy on the wall.
That's not what we hear all the time.

387
00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:09.980
It's not a,
not it at all.

388
00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:15.140
It's the time you get to spend with family and friends and the traditions that

389
00:26:15.141 --> 00:26:19.160
are created.
And that's what makes it so meaningful.

390
00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:23.910
And that's what makes it exciting for folks.
And,

391
00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:27.080
and who really understand that.
Again,

392
00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:31.880
it's not about the trophy,
it's about the experience.
And again,

393
00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:35.090
and there's another buzzword where the experience economy,
right?

394
00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:38.180
And everyone's spending money on the experiences.
You know,
you see all of these,

395
00:26:38.181 --> 00:26:42.290
it's like Ding,
Ding,
Ding.
You know,
business buzzword Bingo.
You know.

396
00:26:42.291 --> 00:26:43.380
But in the end,

397
00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:47.610
we're experienced based brand because our product is purpose built for people

398
00:26:47.611 --> 00:26:48.480
who do things.

399
00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:52.410
They don't sit on couches and watch the discovery channel to dream about a

400
00:26:52.411 --> 00:26:55.440
lifestyle.
They'd live that lifestyle.

401
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:58.740
And I guess the goal is how can we inspire others to do the same?

402
00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:02.370
You may be a weekend warrior now,
great pick up,
pick up a hobby,

403
00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:07.830
but a couple of craft that would be success for us if we're able to do that as a

404
00:27:08.401 --> 00:27:12.830
brand.
All right?
And because we know too that you know,

405
00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:17.700
sometimes the best meals aren't in a restaurant kid outside and enjoy it.

406
00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:22.860
This is actually a guy from,
he's the chef and owner of the grains restaurant.

407
00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:27.540
If you know Brandon here locally,
great guy,
great partner,
farm to table.

408
00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:29.700
We love to work with them on a lot of things.

409
00:27:29.701 --> 00:27:33.240
We do a lot of things locally with friends and you know that we've built up and

410
00:27:33.241 --> 00:27:35.880
developed relationships with through work and gotten to know.

411
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:42.330
So how do we outwork them all?
Um,
you know,
in a simple sense

412
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:47.910
we start with you've got to have empathy for one,
one key area.

413
00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:53.130
You have to remember typical household income of that core demographic,

414
00:27:53.131 --> 00:27:56.730
not the broader sense,
but the core is about 55 to $60,000.

415
00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:01.050
So credit card limits,
thousand maybe two.

416
00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:03.270
So one of the things that we focus on,

417
00:28:03.271 --> 00:28:07.680
cause I'm responsible for our direct to consumer business to um,
my gosh,

418
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:10.260
if they have a return,
they need that return credited quickly.

419
00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:15.870
$150 order is lot and it matters and they value it.

420
00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:17.250
You know,

421
00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:22.250
they value those dollars to get them to spend $150 on Carhartt traditionally

422
00:28:22.381 --> 00:28:25.380
ends up being a Christmas purchase or a birthday purchase or something else

423
00:28:25.381 --> 00:28:28.800
significant,
right?
You have to empathize with that.

424
00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:32.550
You have to remember that farmer we talked about in the frugality of it,

425
00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:37.650
you know,
and really,
really understand them,
that if they're going to do it,

426
00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:40.530
you live up to it and you'd deliver on that promise.
And if we fail,

427
00:28:40.531 --> 00:28:43.920
for some reason with our product,
we always,
always take it back.

428
00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:46.770
And we always make them good.
Good on that promise.

429
00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:52.470
We absolutely believe in inspiring a way of life.
It's what we live for.

430
00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:56.820
That's what one of the things that makes this job so awesome is because we can

431
00:28:56.821 --> 00:28:57.654
do that.

432
00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:00.930
And we have an owner who believes in that way of life is family's believed in it

433
00:29:00.931 --> 00:29:03.460
since the founder,
you know,
and,

434
00:29:03.461 --> 00:29:07.590
and we look at it through their passions and live it through their passions all

435
00:29:07.591 --> 00:29:11.640
the time with emotional,
authentic,
original stories.
And people always go,
well,

436
00:29:11.641 --> 00:29:15.150
why?
Well there's a part of your brain that causes people to love people.

437
00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:18.450
It also causes you to love that dog and love brands.

438
00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:20.310
And the best brands get that.

439
00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:25.730
You can't explain that though with a spreadsheet sometimes in meetings outside

440
00:29:26.101 --> 00:29:31.101
of some studies that talk about people and their connectedness or their love of

441
00:29:31.171 --> 00:29:32.640
brand.
So you can do that.

442
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.690
And what they found through the years is that that has the closest correlation

443
00:29:36.691 --> 00:29:38.340
to revenue over loyalty.

444
00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:42.190
Your love of a brand has a higher correlation to revenue than loyalty.

445
00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:46.900
And it means something and it's important in this day and age.

446
00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:50.500
And so that's one of the reasons we really focus on that because we also want to

447
00:29:50.501 --> 00:29:54.940
be top of mind.
How do I just roommate top line,
because I've seen all your stats.

448
00:29:54.941 --> 00:29:58.600
It drives me nuts.
Most Google searches don't start with a brand in mind.

449
00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:03.010
It's like,
Oh God,
so they just do coats.
That's horrible.

450
00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:07.030
You know,
I want you to do car coats.
You know,

451
00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:11.380
cause if you look at coats you might see a better deal from somebody else.
Right?

452
00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:12.700
But that happens.

453
00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:16.990
So you have to be emotionally engaged and connected and we have to broaden our

454
00:30:16.991 --> 00:30:19.300
reach in order to do that.
Okay.

455
00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:22.150
So build trust and loyalty.

456
00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:26.020
These are three newest consumer profiles we've identified today.
Chris,

457
00:30:26.021 --> 00:30:29.650
who's that millennial mindset working in,
working in the trades,

458
00:30:29.651 --> 00:30:32.560
typically learning their way through Samantha,

459
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:37.030
more of an expert on the female end of the spectrum.
And then David Garcia,

460
00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:41.650
Hispanic profile,
English speaking,
second generation,
you know,

461
00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:46.420
living basically an all American style of life,
but certainly very,

462
00:30:46.421 --> 00:30:50.620
very tied to the traditions of where he and his family come from.

463
00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:53.290
You know?
So those are the three new ones.

464
00:30:53.291 --> 00:30:57.520
And we have a mic consumer that we identify with and he's the traditional over

465
00:30:57.521 --> 00:31:01.990
45 guy that most people recognize with the card.
All right.

466
00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:05.200
So along the way,
we're not saying we're ignoring him by any stretch.

467
00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:07.720
He's the most loyal spending the most right now because he has the most money to

468
00:31:07.721 --> 00:31:11.980
spend.
Um,
well what we are saying is as we shift our vow,
our shift,

469
00:31:11.981 --> 00:31:15.790
our messaging in reach and target,
we're going after these folks.

470
00:31:15.791 --> 00:31:16.750
First and foremost,

471
00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:20.500
Mike continues to overhear it and he's not seeing anything with this brand that

472
00:31:20.501 --> 00:31:23.470
would freak them out and tell him,
wait a minute,
what happened to my car?

473
00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:29.950
Um,
you guys really help us with this.
We have a saying,
you know,

474
00:31:29.951 --> 00:31:34.951
are we doing everything possible to make it easy for hardworking people to

475
00:31:35.201 --> 00:31:39.700
choose Carhartt?
So that's what guides our actions.

476
00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:43.990
That's what guides our effort.
And our goal is to do that all year long.

477
00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:45.460
We have a big challenge though.

478
00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:49.030
We do not sell our product in the number one places.

479
00:31:49.031 --> 00:31:53.290
They like to shop outside of one,
which is a competitor of yours,
Amazon slightly.

480
00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:55.660
That is the only place we are,

481
00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:59.620
that is a dominant desk destination for shoppers today.

482
00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:03.370
And they're just building apparel as a destination choice for them.
Right?

483
00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:06.670
We're not Walmart,
we're not in target.
We're not in Coles.

484
00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:09.130
We're not JC Penney and Sears.
Thank God

485
00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:15.350
nobody.
You know,
you can delete that later.
Um,

486
00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:19.960
but we're not in these places where the bulk of all clothing is bought.

487
00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:23.920
All the studies tell us that those are purposeful choices that we make,

488
00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:26.920
not because we want to make our life difficult for the consumer,

489
00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:30.310
but because of the way we believe in running our business and running the brand

490
00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:34.300
and they just don't match up with our beliefs today.
Right?

491
00:32:34.301 --> 00:32:39.301
So what that means is we're not always easy and accessible and then a

492
00:32:39.381 --> 00:32:42.800
convenience driven world.
I was just saying this the other day,
um,
and I,

493
00:32:42.801 --> 00:32:43.910
and I mentioned it at lunch,

494
00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:48.320
we are in an age of brands because retailers going through an incredibly

495
00:32:48.321 --> 00:32:51.500
difficult time.
For those of you working with retailers right now,

496
00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:54.980
they are really challenged.
If you have not invested in the web,

497
00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:59.600
it's too late and you probably don't have the capital to do it because it's all

498
00:32:59.601 --> 00:33:01.610
sunk.
A bunch of stores that are underperforming.

499
00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:05.400
And so you have to figure out how to get out of those stores.
And,
and,
and,

500
00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:09.920
and we've had meetings with some retailers who will go unnamed who are very

501
00:33:09.921 --> 00:33:13.010
longstanding partners of ours who had been like,
you know,
this Internet thing.

502
00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:15.530
I just still can't figure it out.

503
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:17.750
And literally that's what's come out of their mouth.

504
00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:21.110
And you just look at it and you go,
Oh God,
you know,
like,

505
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:27.430
I don't know what to tell you other than you are not on the radar of the next

506
00:33:27.981 --> 00:33:28.641
generation.

507
00:33:28.641 --> 00:33:32.960
You may have your current but the next generation doesn't even know you exist.

508
00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:36.500
Right.
Cause you're not a part of that journey.

509
00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:41.420
And unfortunately it's too many retailers and they don't even know where to

510
00:33:41.421 --> 00:33:44.900
start.
So if there's ever an opportunity for business for you guys,

511
00:33:44.901 --> 00:33:47.480
it's figuring that out for them because they can't do it.

512
00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:53.090
They flat out can't and we need them to buy and large.
Um,

513
00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:58.120
because ultimately it will define how many square feet per person we have from a

514
00:33:58.491 --> 00:34:02.870
retail perspective and whether or not the 20,
I think we're at like 20 and the,

515
00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:05.210
and the UK.
And Europe is at like five,

516
00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:10.450
so we forex every other country when it comes to how much retail we have

517
00:34:11.571 --> 00:34:15.320
dedicated per person.
We've over retailed this country.

518
00:34:15.321 --> 00:34:16.940
So it's going to decline.

519
00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:21.140
But we would still like there to be some retail stores around please.
Um,

520
00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:24.500
70% of people still say they'd rather buy clothing in a store because they'd

521
00:34:24.501 --> 00:34:26.060
like to try it on.
They like to feel it.

522
00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:28.700
They'd like to make sure that fit is what it says it is.

523
00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:30.650
They don't want to deal with the hassle of returns.

524
00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:33.860
Number one complaint still with our consumer.
What a nightmare.

525
00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:36.020
And what's odd is rather than return it to us,

526
00:34:36.021 --> 00:34:38.510
a lot of them say they'd rather just sell it on craigslist or on Ebay.

527
00:34:38.511 --> 00:34:42.740
And I'm like,
you still have to ship it.
You know?
But that's what they say.

528
00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:47.960
I don't know why.
So,
you know,
that's our,
that's one of our key areas of focus.

529
00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:49.143
Um,

530
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:53.120
because we really believe in this idea that we're out of the disruptor phase of

531
00:34:53.121 --> 00:34:56.390
marketing.
It is not about disrupting,
it's about enabling.

532
00:34:57.350 --> 00:35:01.190
How are we enabling and empowering that path to purchase.
And again,

533
00:35:01.191 --> 00:35:04.560
you guys play a big,
big part in this and that's,

534
00:35:04.561 --> 00:35:08.090
that's the focus all the time as a team over and over again.

535
00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:11.210
How do we break down,
cause it's a challenge inside our walls.

536
00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:14.780
We had too many silos every single day within marketing and other worlds.

537
00:35:14.781 --> 00:35:16.880
It's like guys,
this is not about us.

538
00:35:16.881 --> 00:35:20.090
This is about them and we are in service to their journey.

539
00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:24.440
We're in service to their ability to choose us because that's what's going to

540
00:35:24.441 --> 00:35:27.980
keep the lights on and keep the legacy alive for the fifth generation of

541
00:35:27.981 --> 00:35:31.610
Carhartt that's already in the business learning the business today.

542
00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:34.850
We have all three kids working in the business right now,
which is awesome

543
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:39.300
and we're always measuring and we're always learning and we're always looking at

544
00:35:39.301 --> 00:35:41.070
it again and again and say how can we get better?

545
00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:42.870
What else can we get out out of their way?

546
00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:46.920
What else is getting in the blocking them from making the right choice?
Right?

547
00:35:46.921 --> 00:35:51.780
And you guys again provide a lot of great metrics on this traditional I've

548
00:35:51.781 --> 00:35:55.200
always enjoyed and I'm just going to make one plug.
I haven't seen the,

549
00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:58.890
like the Q four results are those in yet because I always love like the Q four

550
00:35:58.891 --> 00:36:03.570
graph that shows search and how we did and what's going on because that gives us

551
00:36:03.571 --> 00:36:07.860
an idea life.
Beautiful.
Um,

552
00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:09.630
so we're always measuring.

553
00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:13.920
So another video to kind of wrap this all up for you guys here.

554
00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:17.220
And then I've got just a quick breakdown of how we look at things from a media

555
00:36:17.221 --> 00:36:18.240
perspective as well.

556
00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:41.890
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

557
00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:59.110
<v 0>look overview.
So just to let you know where we're up to,</v>

558
00:37:59.111 --> 00:38:01.180
we're going to continue a story.
We started last year.

559
00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:05.890
We're just celebrating the future through our heritage and our founder and his

560
00:38:05.891 --> 00:38:09.430
guiding principles were at a long time we've been making new products,

561
00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:10.750
introducing a lot more products.

562
00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:14.380
We're overcoming the stigma that used to be that the new product from cart was a

563
00:38:14.381 --> 00:38:15.214
new color.

564
00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:19.300
So know we're launching a lot of new products because we really want to be your

565
00:38:19.301 --> 00:38:23.200
round relevant and we're committed and dedicated to fuck to making that happen.

566
00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:27.850
Oh.
So that folks just don't reach for their car heart when the mercury drops.

567
00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:32.020
We want to be that year round brand and I'm not,
I'm just showing this to say,

568
00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:34.420
and we are dedicated from a brand calendar.

569
00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:37.480
We are constantly executing content,

570
00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:42.630
storytelling and messaging to be relevant and top of mind as often as our dollar

571
00:38:43.241 --> 00:38:47.620
will allow us to be across multiple channels.
All right?

572
00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:50.830
And we break it down in three ways.
Um,

573
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:54.490
and we do this because my paid bucket is not big enough to do it any other way,

574
00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:59.380
right?
My owned and earned are just as important to us as our paid.

575
00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:00.661
And,

576
00:39:00.661 --> 00:39:05.320
and so that's how we think about things because I cannot beat the competition by

577
00:39:05.321 --> 00:39:06.880
just outspending the competition.

578
00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:11.440
And really the team is really focused on this.
So when they owned bucket,

579
00:39:11.441 --> 00:39:12.760
just a few examples.
Our website,

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:16.510
we look at this as the front door to the brand and we have a lot of work to do

581
00:39:16.511 --> 00:39:20.260
still,
but we've made tremendous progress over the last three years.
You know,

582
00:39:20.261 --> 00:39:23.110
I see the dog gone Google speed analysis you send to us.

583
00:39:23.111 --> 00:39:26.890
I know we're meeting with our agencies.
We want to make it faster for mobile.

584
00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:30.490
We know for three G it's too slow.
So we get it.

585
00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:35.500
You know,
I just got it.
I like my CIO though,
says we just need an APP.
I'm like,

586
00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:37.570
okay,
we need an APP.

587
00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:40.420
But what about for all the other people who don't want to have the APP?
Right.

588
00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:45.160
So we're working on it.
Um,
we launched a store,
a flagship store in Detroit.

589
00:39:45.161 --> 00:39:47.920
Everyone said,
what on earth were you doing putting a store in midtown?

590
00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:52.510
We'd look kind of smart now.
Thank God.
Um,
I mean it's doing really,

591
00:39:52.511 --> 00:39:56.530
really well and we have a nice billboard there on the side and it does a great

592
00:39:56.531 --> 00:39:59.920
job of letting people know that we're there in Detroit and a lot of pride and

593
00:39:59.921 --> 00:40:03.880
it's been in a lot of videos really commemorating their pride and return of

594
00:40:03.881 --> 00:40:06.910
Detroit.
And that's the interior as you walk in,
you know,

595
00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:10.960
we view that as own though every person who walks in the retail stores we own

596
00:40:10.961 --> 00:40:14.590
and operate is having a Carhartt experience.
We directly deliver.

597
00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:18.800
That is a powerful owned opportunity just from a marketing standpoint.

598
00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:20.170
Little on a selling standpoint.

599
00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:23.170
If we leave them with a great experience with the brand and the types of people

600
00:40:23.171 --> 00:40:25.480
that work there,
that's a win.
Now granted,

601
00:40:25.481 --> 00:40:27.850
we'd like them to buy stuff too cause we need to pay the bills,

602
00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:32.080
but every person who walks through gets a better sense of who we are.

603
00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:35.920
They recognize that we're not just brown duct bibs and coats.
They're like,

604
00:40:35.921 --> 00:40:40.180
oh my God,
we hear it all the time.
Wow,
this is heart.
We make all this stuff.

605
00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:41.770
And we're like,
yeah,
we do

606
00:40:44.890 --> 00:40:49.270
men's journal and,
and really what we're looking at,
I think I skipped a slide.

607
00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:52.870
Yeah.
Well here I'm going to skip forward earned.
Here we go.

608
00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:54.720
I'll go back and forth.
Um,

609
00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:58.660
we don't want you to beer to celebrate 120 fifth with new Holland on the west

610
00:40:58.661 --> 00:41:01.720
side of the state.
Men's journal said,
that's a really cool idea.

611
00:41:01.721 --> 00:41:02.650
We'd like to cover it.

612
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:06.340
So we did a tour all the way to the great American beer festival in Denver and

613
00:41:06.341 --> 00:41:10.360
we had a pint with consumers in every town along the way and brought their

614
00:41:10.361 --> 00:41:13.360
stories to life.
And this was really as just a celebration.
Hey,

615
00:41:13.361 --> 00:41:17.350
what do you do it when you celebrate,
you drink a beer,
you raise a toast.

616
00:41:17.650 --> 00:41:19.540
Well that's,
that's what this was meant to do.

617
00:41:19.541 --> 00:41:23.800
And it led to tons and tons of earned media and impressions and storytelling.

618
00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:27.490
I hear there's,
I heard there was a sneaker head in here,
maybe one or two.

619
00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:32.050
We did this in collaboration with m and M and brand Jordan.
Why did we do it?

620
00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:33.190
Well,
first and foremost,

621
00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:36.800
we did it to raise funds for the versus project that's run by Michigan state in

622
00:41:36.801 --> 00:41:39.560
inner city Detroit hundred percent dedicated to one thing,

623
00:41:39.561 --> 00:41:42.590
which is what m and m talked about that he cares the most about,

624
00:41:42.591 --> 00:41:46.280
which is the reason he's where he is today is because he actually went back to

625
00:41:46.281 --> 00:41:50.840
school and he learned how to read and write.
If he couldn't read and write,

626
00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:52.610
he wouldn't be who he is today.

627
00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:58.360
And unfortunately the illiteracy rate in Detroit is astoundingly high.

628
00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:02.300
And if you can't read and write,
you can't even get it.

629
00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:05.810
You can't get a traits job,
which is what we're focused on.
Two.

630
00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:11.320
So this we raised a crazy amount of money auctioning off 10 pairs and it's still

631
00:42:12.321 --> 00:42:16.040
one of the most sought after sneakers right now.
Uh,
the Jordan brand,

632
00:42:16.050 --> 00:42:17.000
we stay in touch with them,

633
00:42:17.001 --> 00:42:20.780
they're getting calls all the time from famous people who are dying to get them

634
00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:23.120
and,
and it just continues to live on.

635
00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:28.420
But the purpose was first and foremost to do a good thing in our backyard and it

636
00:42:28.521 --> 00:42:31.580
allowed us to do it and crazy amounts of coverage.

637
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:37.820
Another backyard partner Chevy trucks came to us and said,
you know,
I don't,

638
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:41.240
we were like,
we don't know why we didn't do this like 25 years ago,

639
00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:45.020
but he'd make a lot of sense for us to do a truck with you guys and make it the

640
00:42:45.021 --> 00:42:47.930
ultimate work truck.
So this was a showcase truck.

641
00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:50.270
It was at the auto show in Detroit.
It was in la,

642
00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:53.150
it was at a couple of other big shows.
And it's been a really,
really,

643
00:42:53.151 --> 00:42:55.370
really well received concept and idea.

644
00:42:55.850 --> 00:42:58.550
So we're going to continue to talk with one another and see if that we can

645
00:42:58.551 --> 00:43:03.290
actually figure out if this makes sense for a production run as well to make the

646
00:43:03.291 --> 00:43:04.370
ultimate work truck.

647
00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:10.190
You guys saw this on the earned side.
Again,
you know,

648
00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:12.710
collaborations and partnerships to tell meaningful stories.

649
00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:17.300
We're also very active in movies.
We love it.
This jacket,

650
00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:20.990
the year this movie came out,
sold it out so that in the US and in Europe,

651
00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:23.510
swear to God,
that jacket,

652
00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:28.880
that jacket hadn't moved beyond its normal trajectory for decades.

653
00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:32.510
This movie comes out,
Bam.
It's unbelievable.

654
00:43:34.850 --> 00:43:39.850
Just won an Oscar for Manchester by the sea again wearing our jacket throughout

655
00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:46.040
that film.
And then we have a superhero now,
our first superhero.

656
00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:50.330
Everyone know who this is?
Luke cage.

657
00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:53.510
Do you know what happened when this show debuted on Netflix?

658
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:58.640
Guys had to laugh about this.
We haven't who you are.
It crashed Netflix.

659
00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:01.970
Would this show debuted at crash Netflix?

660
00:44:03.110 --> 00:44:04.730
We're super excited about the next season.

661
00:44:04.731 --> 00:44:07.430
I guess they're pulling them all together and some other cast,

662
00:44:07.730 --> 00:44:11.200
I forget what it's,
my son would tell me what it is.
Um,
but I,

663
00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:12.980
but he's going to be wearing our new coat,

664
00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:16.940
which is called full swing and he continues to wear the car print.

665
00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:21.590
And then on the paid front,
I had to put a plug in for you guys.

666
00:44:23.310 --> 00:44:26.630
This is from this morning.
Thankfully Emily,
we're at the top.
That was good.

667
00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:31.770
And I did not click on the ad.
I never do and it please don't.
Um,

668
00:44:35.370 --> 00:44:38.160
I know you guys want us to,
but I don't,
I always tell people at work,

669
00:44:38.161 --> 00:44:42.720
don't click on the top one,
go down to the one that's free.
Sorry.

670
00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:46.380
We have enough people that are clicking on the top one.
It's working really well.

671
00:44:46.770 --> 00:44:50.670
Um,
but this is,
this is such a discovery mode and for us,

672
00:44:50.671 --> 00:44:54.630
this is one of those signals that we love to look at to see how people are

673
00:44:54.631 --> 00:44:55.770
reacting to our work.

674
00:44:56.220 --> 00:45:00.450
We see that people will start searching us more aggressively if our work is

675
00:45:00.451 --> 00:45:04.560
really resonating.
And let me tell you,
I've got a lot of right brain.

676
00:45:04.650 --> 00:45:06.450
I've got just enough left brain to survive.

677
00:45:06.690 --> 00:45:08.130
But there are a lot of left brainers who got,

678
00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:11.550
why don't I see numbers when we do stuff and go,
well what did it do?

679
00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:15.720
And I love it when you guys can give us that kind of information like Oh my God,

680
00:45:15.721 --> 00:45:20.040
look at all the search people put this happened and like within a week or so

681
00:45:21.390 --> 00:45:25.500
it's powerful.
So thank you.
Um,
retail,
I talked about where we are.

682
00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:27.180
This is where we are for examples.

683
00:45:27.181 --> 00:45:30.180
Field and stream is a Dick's sporting goods concept in the outdoor industry.

684
00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:33.430
You know our focus,
I look at this as paid and,

685
00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:38.290
and the reason I do is see all that beautiful imagery and this is first and
main.

686
00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:39.690
This is right when you walk in their store.

687
00:45:40.290 --> 00:45:42.060
That's a billboard at the point of decision.

688
00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:46.230
So I look at those as one of the most valuable spins we can make because I'm

689
00:45:46.231 --> 00:45:49.800
putting front and center at that point of decision,
that zero moment of truth,

690
00:45:49.801 --> 00:45:53.250
I think you guys coined a while ago,
you know this is boot barn.

691
00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:58.260
Have you ever heard of a boot barn?
Anyone?
Anyone?
Oh my God,
somebody has.

692
00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:02.610
But they are now publicly traded and they're chasing the western fashion trend

693
00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:07.020
all over the country as well out of southern California.
Believe it or not,

694
00:46:07.021 --> 00:46:11.690
not Texas.
Um,
and they are growing rapidly.
Um,
tractor supply and window,

695
00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:15.900
treachery supply.
Yeah,
there we go.
So before I worked at card,

696
00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:17.040
I thought tractor supply was,

697
00:46:17.041 --> 00:46:21.060
we're tractor supplies were sold I think.

698
00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:25.320
And they still have to overcome that name and they are an invaluable partner.

699
00:46:25.321 --> 00:46:29.840
Great partner.
12 or 1500 doors,
I think they're up to now,
you know,
and,

700
00:46:29.841 --> 00:46:33.480
and we're bringing our brand to life with them in new ways,
which is awesome.

701
00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:37.830
Orchard supply hardware store in the west coast owned by Lowe's.

702
00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:41.580
They are beautiful,
I think of you'd compare them to downtown,

703
00:46:41.581 --> 00:46:45.240
home and garden if you recognize that that local retailer here as well.

704
00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:49.500
And this is just an example of how crazy it can be with our mom and pops.

705
00:46:49.501 --> 00:46:52.200
And this is why they're important to us.
This is a Hartville hardware.

706
00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:53.460
It's in central Ohio.

707
00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:57.930
We have somewhere in the neighborhood of like 10,000 square feet,

708
00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:00.240
which is bigger than some of our retail stores.

709
00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:02.970
We do millions of dollars to this one hardware store,

710
00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:07.890
we really need them to figure out the internet,
you know,
again,

711
00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:10.890
if that's how important it can be for us as we think about this.

712
00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:14.910
And then the trips to those stores have led to this chain in Europe.

713
00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:19.440
So in Ireland there's a hardware chain called woodies and we are scaling shops

714
00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:23.910
all over Ireland,
um,
with,
uh,
with this hardware chain where our brand is,

715
00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:28.920
is really new in the work ware space.
So that is

716
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:33.900
Carhartt.
So thank you for staying through it all.

717
00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:39.103
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

718
00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:44.270
<v 0>thank you.
That was a,
that was awesome.
Um,
I know</v>

719
00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:49.100
<v 5>being in,
in Michigan and,
uh,
personally living just outside of Detroit,
uh,</v>

720
00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:53.460
carhartts been one of those brands that really in the last like call it like

721
00:47:53.461 --> 00:47:57.450
five to six years has kind of come into the,
uh,
the,
the,

722
00:47:57.451 --> 00:48:00.750
the millennials like cased,
which is kind of a benefit.

723
00:48:00.751 --> 00:48:03.360
But to hear you talk about the authenticity that,
you know,

724
00:48:03.361 --> 00:48:05.520
it's like you're not necessarily trying to do that.

725
00:48:05.521 --> 00:48:10.320
It just works out because you're authentic without having to try.

726
00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:15.180
<v 0>Usually you're usually,
you're only authentic when you're not trying.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

727
00:48:15.370 --> 00:48:18.920
But,
uh,
no,
it's,
uh,
we have an amazing story to tell him.

728
00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:22.810
We just need you to tell it quite honestly.
And that's,
that's,

729
00:48:22.811 --> 00:48:25.180
that's what we're all focused on.
Yeah.
And so,
and,

730
00:48:25.181 --> 00:48:28.910
and you touched on this a little bit,
but the decision to put the,

731
00:48:28.911 --> 00:48:31.840
the store in midtown Detroit,
can you tell me a little bit about,

732
00:48:31.841 --> 00:48:34.840
it sounds like maybe there was a,
there's a backstory of some debate.

733
00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:36.280
There was definitely a debate.
I mean,

734
00:48:36.281 --> 00:48:39.210
you've got a lot in Detroit as proud Detroit is in the office.
Okay.

735
00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:41.050
People have been there for longer than I.
Yeah.
And,

736
00:48:41.090 --> 00:48:43.920
and Jamie Miller who runs our retail division,
you know,

737
00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:48.010
has been with us now for I think five years and he's been with great retail

738
00:48:48.011 --> 00:48:50.140
brands throughout his career.
You know,

739
00:48:50.141 --> 00:48:54.220
he found this space and he really had the vision for it.
And,
uh,
you know,

740
00:48:54.221 --> 00:48:58.600
he championed it inside the halls because midtown w what was it,

741
00:48:58.601 --> 00:49:01.930
three plus years ago when we signed the lease,
somewhere in that neighborhood,

742
00:49:02.170 --> 00:49:07.120
midtown was still kind of,
you know,
merging.
And now,

743
00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:11.520
I mean,
we're seeing more and more retail brands pop up all around us.
Yeah.

744
00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:13.180
So it's been exciting.

745
00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:15.670
We couldn't believe on people really turned out for it too.

746
00:49:15.850 --> 00:49:17.490
It's doing really well.
Yeah.
Far exceeding.

747
00:49:18.050 --> 00:49:22.970
<v 5>No,
that's great.
Uh,
by children destroyed it this weekend.
I'm so sorry.
My bad.
Uh,</v>

748
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:23.833
nope.

749
00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:28.550
<v 0>Um,
so I,
I want to talk a little bit about your career path.
It's been very cool.</v>

750
00:49:28.551 --> 00:49:28.731
I mean,

751
00:49:28.731 --> 00:49:31.880
there's a lot of people in here that work with all different types of clients.

752
00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:36.140
Um,
but I,
I personally work with a lot of retailers in,
in the apparel space.
So,

753
00:49:36.370 --> 00:49:38.750
um,
can you take us through just Kinda your,
your career?
I mean,

754
00:49:38.751 --> 00:49:42.110
we covered it a little bit,
but I'd love to hear about the path that led you to,

755
00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:45.920
to God heart.
Uh,
sure.
I mean,
I'll,
I'll try to be brief.

756
00:49:46.770 --> 00:49:49.970
It can be pretty boring really quickly.
You know,
I,
uh,

757
00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:52.820
I just knew that I wanted to be a part of things that people were passionate

758
00:49:52.821 --> 00:49:56.620
about.
Um,
I wanted to work in the marketing space.
I was an Econ,
poly side,

759
00:49:56.621 --> 00:49:59.740
double major.
Most people in my space didn't go into marketing.

760
00:49:59.750 --> 00:50:02.740
They went into investment banking or law.
And uh,

761
00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:06.120
I just knew I wanted to be in a space that people really cared about.
Um,

762
00:50:06.290 --> 00:50:09.800
my worst nightmare was trying to convince people to buy a brand or a product

763
00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:13.430
that you really didn't care about.
And I've always used the example not to be,

764
00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:16.130
you know,
not to be negative on the people who do that.
But like,

765
00:50:16.131 --> 00:50:20.670
I would never want to be like the head of like a toilet paper brand,
you know,
or,

766
00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:21.531
or something like that.

767
00:50:21.531 --> 00:50:24.470
Like I wanted to be something I always said I wanted to be something that people

768
00:50:24.471 --> 00:50:29.390
were passionate about and,
and,
and,
and the,
and really the key insight for me was,

769
00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:31.220
and still is,
I mean,
I'm,

770
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:35.450
I'm really passionate about things that are related to the life I grew up with

771
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:38.090
and I grew up very connected to sport.

772
00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:40.820
And very connected to a blue collar way of life.
And,

773
00:50:40.821 --> 00:50:44.690
and that's where that's really led my path.
And I had a really great person,

774
00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:46.880
Alan Rosenshine,
um,
who was,
uh,

775
00:50:46.881 --> 00:50:49.580
an alum of the university college I went to as an Undergrad,

776
00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:52.550
basically give me that advice while I was trying to figure out what the heck I

777
00:50:52.551 --> 00:50:56.240
wanted to do.
And he said,
just follow your heart,
follow your passion.
And,
uh,

778
00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:57.950
that's what I've done every step of the way.

779
00:50:57.951 --> 00:51:01.760
And I've had a chance to work for a sports agency representing a bull's players

780
00:51:01.761 --> 00:51:03.290
when they made their second run of three.

781
00:51:03.590 --> 00:51:06.470
I worked for planet Hollywood when everyone said that that was going to be the

782
00:51:06.471 --> 00:51:11.250
next concept of experience.
And,
uh,
then I went to Nike and under Armour.
And,

783
00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:13.690
and what I found every step of the way is a,

784
00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:16.430
it's a heck of a lot of fun when you work for brands,

785
00:51:16.431 --> 00:51:20.390
people care a great deal about,
you know,
and,
and that's what I have with the car.

786
00:51:20.391 --> 00:51:21.650
I heard as well.
Very cool.

787
00:51:21.730 --> 00:51:26.380
<v 5>So a Nike under Armour going Ben to a lot,</v>

788
00:51:26.381 --> 00:51:30.070
a lot of big cities.
Uh,
and then,
uh,
obviously you're in proximity to your,

789
00:51:30.071 --> 00:51:34.330
your hometown,
but yes,
you wound up in Dearborn,
in Carhart and Detroit.

790
00:51:34.690 --> 00:51:37.360
Um,
how have you found,
how have you found the fair cities?

791
00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:41.010
<v 0>Oh,
great.
I mean really.
Yeah,
no,
it's funny yet I saw that.</v>

792
00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:44.000
So when I moved to Portland in [inaudible] 99,
Portland was not the Pearl.

793
00:51:44.001 --> 00:51:46.650
And you see today,
it's unbelievable how that has changed.

794
00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:51.450
It was pretty rough and rugged.
I lived off of Burnside and it was,

795
00:51:51.451 --> 00:51:55.560
uh,
you know,
you know,
just a really,
really kind of,
it was turning,

796
00:51:55.561 --> 00:51:58.770
but it was far from turning,
you know,
the Pearl district.
Anybody been there?

797
00:51:59.130 --> 00:52:01.860
You know,
where the Pearl district is today.
It's basically taken over Portland.

798
00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:02.330
Anyway,

799
00:52:02.330 --> 00:52:06.600
some Portland now is the shining star example of a city reborn and a Baltimore

800
00:52:06.601 --> 00:52:10.020
was doing the same thing.
And then I moved here and now Detroit.
I mean,

801
00:52:10.021 --> 00:52:10.860
when I moved here,

802
00:52:11.010 --> 00:52:14.640
I'll never forget buying a place in Ann Arbor and the lone person we were

803
00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:18.540
getting the loan from at the bank was like,
everyone else is leaving.

804
00:52:18.570 --> 00:52:21.660
Why are you moving here?
You know?
And I looked and I go,
well,

805
00:52:21.690 --> 00:52:25.050
my wife's right here.
Thanks a lot buddy.
Yeah,
I mean,
you know,
but I mean,

806
00:52:25.051 --> 00:52:26.400
it was just that time,
you know,

807
00:52:26.401 --> 00:52:30.990
it was like there was a lot of like unsettled feelings and now you walk around

808
00:52:30.991 --> 00:52:35.700
and there's confidence,
there's pride,
there's belief.
Um,
you know,
and,

809
00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:39.380
and there should be,
yeah,
it's a great place to live in is one of the,
you know,

810
00:52:39.381 --> 00:52:42.480
the best cup streak secrets.
I say if the,
if it had a mountain,

811
00:52:42.481 --> 00:52:45.090
we'd be overpopulated because of the Great Lakes.

812
00:52:45.150 --> 00:52:48.300
If we had a mountain to go with those great lakes,
it'd be over.

813
00:52:48.550 --> 00:52:49.370
That would be over.

814
00:52:49.370 --> 00:52:53.060
<v 5>That's fair.
So,
so what you're saying is basically the next city you moved to,</v>

815
00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:58.120
we should start investing in because that's the pattern.
Got It.
So we are a,

816
00:52:58.130 --> 00:53:00.800
we are almost out of time.
I've got one last question here.

817
00:53:00.801 --> 00:53:04.640
I know there's a lot of,
uh,
folks in the audience,
uh,
that as we mentioned,

818
00:53:04.641 --> 00:53:06.770
kind of like looked at your career path and it's very impressive.

819
00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:10.940
If you had one piece of advice to somebody aspiring to,

820
00:53:10.941 --> 00:53:14.410
to uh,
follow a similar,
similar path yourself.
Right.

821
00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:16.490
<v 0>Um,
well like I said at the beginning,</v>

822
00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:21.470
follow your passion because it will never be work and it hasn't.
And uh,

823
00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:24.170
the number two thing really is,
you know,
find people,

824
00:53:24.171 --> 00:53:27.420
whether you work for them or not,
who you can really,

825
00:53:27.421 --> 00:53:32.280
really learn from and spend as much time as you can soaking up as much as you

826
00:53:32.281 --> 00:53:35.010
can from those folks.
Because I've had the great,

827
00:53:35.011 --> 00:53:40.011
great fortune of having some incredibly smart mentors from the companies where

828
00:53:40.531 --> 00:53:42.120
I've worked,
who've taught me a ton.

829
00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:46.710
And I definitely wouldn't be sitting here right now talking to you guys this way

830
00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:50.760
if it weren't for them.
And those are really the two difference makers for me,

831
00:53:51.090 --> 00:53:53.700
you know,
along the way.
Lastly,
I shouldn't leave her out.

832
00:53:53.701 --> 00:53:56.100
My wife has played a pretty big role in this too,

833
00:53:56.820 --> 00:54:01.000
so it's an incredible partner in crime and being willing to move the way we have

834
00:54:01.001 --> 00:54:05.640
it.
Yeah.
It's funny how that happens.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cool.
Yeah.
Thank you very much,

835
00:54:05.641 --> 00:54:08.970
Tony.
I appreciate it.
A big round of applause.
Applause.

836
00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:12.130
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
