Please join me in giving a warm welcome to Dr Akbari.

9
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.840
<v 0>Hi,
welcome.
Thank you for taking time out of your day today.</v>

10
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.030
It's going to tell you some different stories today and first I want to zap us

11
00:00:48.161 --> 00:00:53.161
back to the year 2008 many of you probably remember that year I was about to

12
00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:58.570
celebrate a major birthday.
I was living in New York City.

13
00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:59.890
I was broke,

14
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.070
I was single and I lived in an old walkup tenement building in Hell's kitchen.

15
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.870
But despite all of that,

16
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.200
I was elated because I also had just finished my dissertation and my phd.

17
00:01:14.561 --> 00:01:19.510
So for me that was this huge milestone that I had been working toward and it was

18
00:01:19.511 --> 00:01:24.100
this thing that was going to offer all kinds of opportunity and ultimately

19
00:01:24.101 --> 00:01:28.900
happiness.
Wow.
Well,
given that it was 2008 within a few months,

20
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.380
everything came crashing down in every sector was affected from Wall Street to

21
00:01:34.901 --> 00:01:38.080
academia.
And I was really,

22
00:01:38.081 --> 00:01:41.350
my life felt really out of control.

23
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.950
And while the timing of this and the particular details of that story might be

24
00:01:49.151 --> 00:01:50.590
different for each of us,

25
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:56.010
trying to make sense of chaos and trying to find happiness at times of chaos is

26
00:01:56.891 --> 00:01:57.970
universal as,
I mean,

27
00:01:57.971 --> 00:02:01.480
all of us have to deal with at different points in our lives.

28
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.940
Too often,
you know,
we invest so much in those big milestones,

29
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.600
no matter what's happening in the rest of the world.
When I finished that degree,

30
00:02:10.601 --> 00:02:14.230
when I get that promotion,
I am going to be happy.

31
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.880
But really in reality,

32
00:02:15.881 --> 00:02:20.230
life is what happens in between those big moments.

33
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.920
And so in startup your life and my new book,

34
00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.130
I look to Silicon Valley and the methodologies and principles that guide it to

35
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.740
use that as a springboard for tools that you can use in your own life to be

36
00:02:38.171 --> 00:02:42.430
happier and more successful no matter what point you're at in your career or

37
00:02:42.431 --> 00:02:46.810
your personal development.
So why a startup approach,

38
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.170
um,
you know,
maybe aren't,
don't have to convince you guys have that,

39
00:02:50.171 --> 00:02:53.560
but I think it's still is worth articulating.
You know,

40
00:02:53.561 --> 00:02:57.760
when startups launch,
chances are they're going to fail.

41
00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.530
Chances are not that they're going to have $1 billion exit that's more of a pipe

42
00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:05.200
drain.
It's something that we hear about a lot in the news,

43
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:09.880
but it's not the reality for most everyone.
And you can't really plan.

44
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.590
You don't even know if you're gonna be around tomorrow.

45
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:16.570
So you have to find a way to be happy in the process.

46
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.610
Along the journey.
They iterate,
they experiment,
they fail,

47
00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:22.444
they pivot.

48
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.130
And that joy in the process is something that a lot of us don't really allow

49
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:30.310
ourselves a lot of time and space to do.

50
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.360
So this is an approach about happiness today.

51
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.600
Not Happiness someday because it's really not the promotion,

52
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.750
it's not the marriage,
it's,
it's the small stuff.

53
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.300
It's the minutiae of your everyday life.

54
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.000
The choices that you make on an everyday basis.

55
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.850
What you're eating right now for lunch,

56
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.970
the culture you engage with the company,
you keep,

57
00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.260
the way you present yourself at a meeting or a presentation,

58
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.910
it's the cumulative effect of all of those things that ultimately have the

59
00:04:06.911 --> 00:04:11.911
biggest impact on these bigger milestones and so often we see a disconnect

60
00:04:12.131 --> 00:04:14.620
between them.
I think it's small stuff doesn't matter.

61
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.810
So this is about how the small stuff really does matter and this is the approach

62
00:04:19.811 --> 00:04:23.920
to living that I needed but couldn't find back in 2008

63
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.370
I want to quick get a sense of how do you guys feel about self help?

64
00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.060
Do you read self help?
Are you into it?
Hate it.
You like it,
you read it,

65
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.030
okay,
well maybe,
maybe some of this resonates with you.

66
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.320
I struggle a lot with that genre.
It's something that I'm inclined toward.

67
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.900
I like self help in theory,

68
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.370
but I have a really hard time connecting with many of the self help books out

69
00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:50.980
there for two main reasons.
One,

70
00:04:50.981 --> 00:04:55.981
I find that a lot of self help books offer one single directive.

71
00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.770
If you just think positively,
if you meditate,

72
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.790
if you dance spontaneously,
your life's going to be fantastic.

73
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.620
And of course all those things are terrific and all things I like to do,

74
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.920
but there's not a panacea for happiness or success or they're written by someone

75
00:05:14.351 --> 00:05:17.030
that I just can't relate to in certainly could not relate to.

76
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.050
Back in 2008 someone who already has their career all figured out and is

77
00:05:23.111 --> 00:05:28.111
thriving and has the perfect family and is financially stable and has their

78
00:05:28.481 --> 00:05:30.570
dream home.
And so there's a disconnect.

79
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.060
You're forced to read between the lines and find where does my story fit into

80
00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.913
this?

81
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.660
So while the bad news is there's no panacea,

82
00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.380
the good news is you can start working on this stuff today and you don't need

83
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.310
bundles of cash or even to be a genius to be able to be happier and more

84
00:05:48.311 --> 00:05:52.480
fulfilled starting right away.
Life is a business.

85
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.950
And I'm going to lay out a few of the key principles that I talk about in my

86
00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.310
book that I think everyone can start applying to their large today.

87
00:06:01.311 --> 00:06:04.910
And a few simple directives that will help you to integrate it.

88
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.310
So the first of the five is hustle.

89
00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.210
This is one of my favorite words because it's really been reappropriated from

90
00:06:14.211 --> 00:06:17.840
having some pretty negative connotations.
Um,

91
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.840
so I was born in Waterloo,

92
00:06:20.841 --> 00:06:25.841
Iowa in a mid sized industrial,

93
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.360
a Midwestern town to a single mother and for political reasons and drama worthy

94
00:06:35.391 --> 00:06:36.320
of a book onto itself.

95
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:41.350
I've never met my Iranian father and anyone who grew up with a single parent or

96
00:06:41.751 --> 00:06:46.190
know someone who did knows it's hard.
It's really hard.
And My mother's family,

97
00:06:46.191 --> 00:06:50.210
my grandfather was a truck driver and my grandmother raised five kids and worked

98
00:06:50.211 --> 00:06:53.030
retail.
So there was no family money.
Uh,

99
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:58.510
but we did have government assistance and we lived in a very colorful apartment

100
00:07:00.321 --> 00:07:04.010
complex on the east side of town where the characters were exactly what you'd

101
00:07:04.011 --> 00:07:08.000
expect at a place that costs under a hundred dollars more to live there.

102
00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:10.640
And we didn't have a car and rode the bus.

103
00:07:10.641 --> 00:07:15.350
And luxury for us was sharing a plate of fries and a piece of chocolate pie

104
00:07:15.351 --> 00:07:16.580
while we waited for the bus.

105
00:07:16.581 --> 00:07:21.380
And those small little moments and those luxuries were also reminders of the

106
00:07:21.381 --> 00:07:23.240
constant financial struggle.

107
00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:27.860
But I wanted to be more than the circumstances that I was born into.

108
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:34.060
So I hustled and I studied and I rose through the ranks like I'm sure many of

109
00:07:35.961 --> 00:07:37.520
you did as well.

110
00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:42.940
And I eventually went on to go to some very expensive schools for many years.

111
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:50.320
And at the time I was really oblivious to the disparity between my financial

112
00:07:52.641 --> 00:07:55.130
situation and the people that were around me.

113
00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:58.670
And people assume that I was wealthy and when they found out that I wasn't,

114
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:03.500
they would say,
oh,
we're just lucky.
And I talk about this in my book,

115
00:08:03.501 --> 00:08:06.080
and I don't know how you feel about that word,
but I hate it.

116
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:10.140
Anyone who's ever had their success dismissed as luck.
All.

117
00:08:10.141 --> 00:08:12.500
It doesn't make me want to fight harder and be better.

118
00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:17.330
And so that's what I tried to do.
I bootstrapped my life.

119
00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:22.100
Now,
bootstrapping is something we hear quite often in the startup world and it's

120
00:08:22.101 --> 00:08:25.130
something that a lot of startups have to do out of necessity,

121
00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:30.160
where you basically do without money and you call on whatever resources you do

122
00:08:31.101 --> 00:08:34.880
have to make the most of the situation.
But it's hard.

123
00:08:34.881 --> 00:08:37.040
Bootstrapping is really difficult.

124
00:08:37.041 --> 00:08:40.970
That breeds a survival mentality and it teaches you some really hard lessons

125
00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:44.420
very fast whether you're ready for it or not,

126
00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:50.740
but you don't have to be starting a company to realize the benefits of

127
00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:56.070
bootstrapping readily.
It's something,
it's more about attitude being a hustler.

128
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:59.940
It's something that everyone can embrace because scrappiness,

129
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:03.900
not pedigree prevails in the long run.

130
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.750
And Hustling keeps you hungry.

131
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.470
And Hunger always beats complacency.

132
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:16.820
So does anyone know what the single biggest indicator is of longterm health and

133
00:09:17.941 --> 00:09:22.540
happiness?
Any ideas?
Sorry?

134
00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:30.400
Genes.
That is a factor for sure.
Yes.
Yes.

135
00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:35.440
Resilience is good.
Yeah.
Uh,
but something that would contribute to your health.

136
00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:40.090
Okay.
There's a big one.
Yeah.
Yeah,
that's it.

137
00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:45.040
That's the big one.
So all of those that you mentioned are definitely part of it.

138
00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:47.870
But social connections,
you know,
companionship.

139
00:09:47.871 --> 00:09:52.420
Something we crave is the single biggest indicator of whether you're going to be

140
00:09:52.421 --> 00:09:54.000
happy and healthy longterm.

141
00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:59.080
So much so that if you are lacking in personal close ties,

142
00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:02.920
it's the equivalent of smoking a pack of cigarettes a day or being obese.

143
00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:06.160
So it's a pretty big,
it's a pretty big deal.

144
00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:10.300
And you know,
partnerships,
they're hard.

145
00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:14.260
So it's easy to say I'm going to do it by myself.
But you know,

146
00:10:14.261 --> 00:10:19.261
business partners and spouses are very similar in a lot of ways.

147
00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:23.980
There's even a honeymoon phase where you think that they're perfect and

148
00:10:23.981 --> 00:10:26.490
everything's fantastic and then you know,

149
00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:30.880
the blemishes start to rise to the surface and the daily tensions,
uh,

150
00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:34.690
start to erode the social graces.

151
00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:39.610
But successful partnerships,
whether it's in business or for pleasure,

152
00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:42.730
are more similar than you might imagine.

153
00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:47.760
And they are not about strength and strength or perfection and perfection.

154
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:52.750
Oftentimes it's the baggage that we bring to those and something we all have

155
00:10:52.751 --> 00:10:57.580
plenty of that actually makes the relationship stronger and the other person

156
00:10:57.581 --> 00:11:00.730
better because whatever it is that you're bringing to the table,

157
00:11:00.731 --> 00:11:02.620
you're challenging that person in a new,

158
00:11:02.621 --> 00:11:05.800
a diff in different way than they would be if they are with someone that's just

159
00:11:05.801 --> 00:11:08.560
like them or if they didn't engage with you at all.

160
00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:14.900
Uh,
Jeff Visa's,
one of your neighbors here,

161
00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:18.890
uh,
when he was looking for a partner,

162
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:24.260
it is told that he actually created a flow chart of the women that he was

163
00:11:24.261 --> 00:11:24.800
dating.

164
00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:29.800
And he approached it like a business and he said that the biggest thing he was

165
00:11:32.001 --> 00:11:36.080
looking for was someone who could get him out of a third world prison because

166
00:11:36.081 --> 00:11:39.230
life is too short to be with someone that isn't resourceful.

167
00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:44.360
And so I have to kind of agree.
Scrappiness,

168
00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:47.120
your sexiness is great,
but scrappiness,

169
00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:52.510
practicality and whole lot of humor goes a long way in both business and

170
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:54.633
pleasure.

171
00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.560
But relationships are significant in our lives,

172
00:11:59.561 --> 00:12:04.360
far beyond just romance or even business partnerships.

173
00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:09.690
There was a time in my life when I used to say that I really wanted a,

174
00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:14.380
uh,
uh,
a patron.
I wanted someone to,

175
00:12:14.381 --> 00:12:18.100
a sponsor of sorts to,
to fund all of my creative pursuits.

176
00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:21.700
And of course that doesn't exist.
And uh,

177
00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:24.580
but I realized I sort of had a variation of that already.

178
00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:29.680
So entrepreneurs will seek their money formally from investors.

179
00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:33.880
Um,
but in our personal lives,
we don't usually have that opportunity.

180
00:12:33.881 --> 00:12:38.881
So we have what I call life vcs and life feces are essentially the individuals

181
00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:45.460
in our lives that console us.

182
00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.520
They mentor us,
they make introductions,

183
00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:53.050
they riff with us on ideas.
And these are,

184
00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.800
it's important to note that a,
this is not networking as usual.

185
00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:01.060
This is not something that's achieved by throwing a business card at someone or

186
00:13:01.061 --> 00:13:03.490
just linking in with them and then disappearing.

187
00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:06.820
This is about cultivating relationships,

188
00:13:06.821 --> 00:13:11.821
both really close and also more peripherally over the course of a long time.

189
00:13:12.341 --> 00:13:15.100
So that there's a constant feedback loop.

190
00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:20.950
And one of the things that prevents that from happening is a phenomenon that has

191
00:13:20.951 --> 00:13:24.340
really skyrocketed as of late,
which is ghosting.

192
00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:26.410
Anyone been ghosted lately?

193
00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:30.490
It used to be sort of this thing that would happen more in dating.

194
00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:34.600
Does everyone know what goes teen is?
No.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.

195
00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:39.660
Go seeing is basically where you maybe have a date with someone or you have a

196
00:13:39.671 --> 00:13:41.080
business meeting with someone,

197
00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.590
something where you would at least think the person would respond to you.

198
00:13:44.591 --> 00:13:47.380
It's not a cold call,
let's put it that way.
And then,

199
00:13:47.381 --> 00:13:50.640
and then they never ever get back to you.
Um,

200
00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:54.460
and this is happening more and more in the professional world as well.

201
00:13:54.461 --> 00:13:58.840
You might even submit a proposal to someone and then suddenly you can't get them

202
00:13:58.841 --> 00:14:01.030
to respond to you for months or maybe ever.

203
00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:05.080
And what happens when we do varying degrees of ghosting is we cut out the

204
00:14:05.081 --> 00:14:10.081
opportunity to nurture those relationships so that we can be mutual life vcs to

205
00:14:11.111 --> 00:14:12.580
each other.
And remember,

206
00:14:12.581 --> 00:14:17.440
you never know where the value in your network is going to land.

207
00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:21.640
The person who introduces you to your life mate or that leads to the

208
00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:25.030
introduction that gets you your dream job.

209
00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:27.160
That might not come from your best friend.

210
00:14:27.161 --> 00:14:29.380
That might not come from a formal mentor.

211
00:14:29.381 --> 00:14:33.040
It might be someone that you have quietly been keeping in touch with and you

212
00:14:33.041 --> 00:14:35.740
have this mutual respect and understanding about.

213
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:41.310
So remember that you're only as good as the company you keep and the work that

214
00:14:42.971 --> 00:14:47.320
you put in to keeping that company around.
All right,

215
00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:51.800
three
embrace failure.

216
00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:54.560
We've all heard of the game.
Angry birds,
right?

217
00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:57.590
One of the most downloaded games of all time.

218
00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:02.330
But what you may not know about angry birds is the company that created it.

219
00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:07.360
Rovio entertainment was not a smashing success before angry birds came on the

220
00:15:08.661 --> 00:15:09.980
scene.
Does anyone,
in fact,

221
00:15:09.981 --> 00:15:12.590
they were close to bankruptcy before angry birds came out.

222
00:15:12.591 --> 00:15:17.591
Does anyone know how many failed or underwhelming games Rovio put out before

223
00:15:17.991 --> 00:15:21.260
angry birds and when?
When?
I guess,
yeah,

224
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:26.840
25 or what?
Yeah,

225
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:30.530
so the second was closer.
51 game.

226
00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:35.570
Angry birds was their 52nd try.

227
00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.400
That's pretty phenomenal.

228
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:42.670
Most people don't have the patients fail formally 51 times before.

229
00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:50.330
And it's not like angry birds was this overnight,
you know,
sort of Instagram.

230
00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:50.961
It was,

231
00:15:50.961 --> 00:15:55.490
it took a while to really build and to have to dominate in the way that it did.

232
00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.770
So let's do think my life has been all successes.

233
00:16:00.771 --> 00:16:03.950
So I think I've kind of already established that wasn't the case.
Um,

234
00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:09.130
I've had quite a few of my own 51 failures days and when I first dipped my toe

235
00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:14.480
and the entrepreneurial and startup world,
it was completely by accident.

236
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:20.030
I was at a friend's house party on a roof in New York,

237
00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:24.500
and this was years ago.
And after sharing a bottle of wine,

238
00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:26.320
I said,
I,

239
00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:31.160
I wanted to start a new social networking platform.
Uh,

240
00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:34.480
it was going to be like Friendster.
Remember Friendster low,

241
00:16:34.481 --> 00:16:37.460
one of the really early social networking platforms only.

242
00:16:37.461 --> 00:16:41.750
This one was going to isolate your dating network.

243
00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:45.890
It was going to link you and visualize everyone you've dated and everyone

244
00:16:45.891 --> 00:16:46.431
they've dated.

245
00:16:46.431 --> 00:16:51.431
And so you'd see all your degrees of relationships based on your dating history.

246
00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.710
Now this was a terrible idea.

247
00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:58.250
That's why you've never heard of it before.

248
00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:04.100
But a friend that was there thought that I was somewhat serious,

249
00:17:04.101 --> 00:17:05.870
I guess,
or thought it was amusing idea,

250
00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.330
pass it on to another friend and we ended up talking about it.

251
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:13.250
He was a software developer and we were able to isolate what wasn't so terrible

252
00:17:13.251 --> 00:17:18.251
about it and that was tracking in person connections and relationships.

253
00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:24.160
And so we started building something and raising money and all the investors

254
00:17:24.531 --> 00:17:28.040
said the same thing.
They said,
sounds great,
really interesting.

255
00:17:28.041 --> 00:17:32.660
Come back to us when you have some traction.
Well,
to get traction,

256
00:17:32.661 --> 00:17:36.470
we decided maybe it'd be better if we pivoted to enterprise and we partnered

257
00:17:36.471 --> 00:17:40.130
with a bunch of big players in that space.
We joined a tech incubator,

258
00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:43.580
we did all these things we were supposed to do,
but the money never came.

259
00:17:43.581 --> 00:17:45.890
The traction never happened.
We were,

260
00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:49.950
we were shifting out of our skillsets and the partnerships were crumbling and it

261
00:17:49.951 --> 00:17:51.420
just wasn't going to happen.

262
00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:54.990
But this wasn't a parent for 18 months.

263
00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:59.790
We bootstrapped for 18 months and then ultimately had this,

264
00:17:59.791 --> 00:18:03.480
just say,
you know what?
This isn't working.
It's not going to happen.

265
00:18:03.481 --> 00:18:07.920
So at the end of that I had no money,
no company,

266
00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:10.530
and no idea what to do next.

267
00:18:10.531 --> 00:18:13.170
And of course my family thought I was absolutely crazy.

268
00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:19.050
And amid the wallowing,
which I did for about two weeks,

269
00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.130
uh,

270
00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:24.990
I had this epiphany when I had been pitching to investors.

271
00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:29.100
Many of them said they would look at my bio and they would say,
yeah,
yeah,

272
00:18:29.101 --> 00:18:32.010
this is fine,
but you know,
I'm really interested in that other thing.

273
00:18:32.011 --> 00:18:36.990
You do that intelligent image consulting.
What's that?
Why don't you,

274
00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:38.430
why don't you do something with that?

275
00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:43.470
And I dismissed it every single time I was so closed to it.

276
00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:46.110
I thought it was just a side hobby.

277
00:18:46.111 --> 00:18:51.111
And it wasn't until I fell on my face with the other project that I thought I

278
00:18:52.651 --> 00:18:57.630
should be working on that finally it became clear to me that the thing that

279
00:18:57.631 --> 00:19:01.320
actually had the most promise and the most legs was the thing that had been

280
00:19:01.321 --> 00:19:03.630
standing in front of me the entire time.

281
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:09.470
But it's amazing how incapacitated would become when we limit and narrow our

282
00:19:11.101 --> 00:19:14.130
outlets for success and our definition of,

283
00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:16.440
of what we should or shouldn't be doing.

284
00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:21.920
And so that moment was embarrassing and humbling and I was completely exhausted

285
00:19:21.991 --> 00:19:26.991
and all I wanted to do was crawl in a hole or runaway to a surf camp and never

286
00:19:27.421 --> 00:19:29.790
come back again.
But that wasn't,

287
00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:33.870
that wasn't the reality that I chose.
It wasn't practical.

288
00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:36.150
And you know,
in,

289
00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:40.830
in Silicon Valley they say that if you aren't failing frequently,

290
00:19:40.831 --> 00:19:45.720
you aren't risking enough.
And Henry Ford,

291
00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:49.380
one of our great inventors said,

292
00:19:49.381 --> 00:19:52.590
failure is an opportunity to begin again more intelligently.

293
00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:57.860
And when you think about the individuals who we really revere as are our

294
00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:02.970
innovators,
the Henry Ford's and the Thomas Edison's,

295
00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:06.810
they failed more often than they succeeded.

296
00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:11.130
And yet we think of them in relationship to their successes because they

297
00:20:11.131 --> 00:20:14.970
persevered because they made something out of those failures.

298
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.430
Out of all the experiments that they do,

299
00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:20.070
that and the resilience that they exhibited,

300
00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:23.850
their 51 plus tries.

301
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:28.950
But most of us lose patients with cultivating success in that way.

302
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:31.410
And so we settle for mediocrity.

303
00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:34.860
We settled the stuff that doesn't even really make us happy.

304
00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:38.970
So how can we get past that?
Well,

305
00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:43.650
we can remember that failure and success are not actually opposites there

306
00:20:43.651 --> 00:20:47.560
compliments that,
that operate on the same spectrum.

307
00:20:47.561 --> 00:20:51.850
So if we start to redefine failure,
then there's more,

308
00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:53.410
there's more space for it.

309
00:20:53.411 --> 00:20:57.850
And then when we do ultimately fail or not so derailed because we were expecting

310
00:20:57.851 --> 00:21:01.960
it.
And also failure is where we grow from.

311
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:03.970
We don't grow from our triumphs.

312
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:08.740
I think about the thing about when you've done really well at something now

313
00:21:08.741 --> 00:21:12.730
think about a time that you really fell on your face.

314
00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:18.760
When did you learn the most?
You know,
what?
What changed your life the most?

315
00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.940
It's,
it's usually the hard one,

316
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.710
but only if we take the time to self reflect,
to process,

317
00:21:26.711 --> 00:21:31.711
to do the analysis and work through it and then fail up and make something out

318
00:21:31.751 --> 00:21:32.584
of it.

319
00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:38.220
So we can make space for failure by surfing fear because it's often the fear

320
00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:44.080
that stands in our way of moving forward and taking these leaps.

321
00:21:44.081 --> 00:21:46.720
So putting ourselves out there.
Okay.

322
00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:51.280
Failure's good for pivots.

323
00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:57.450
2015 blasting the head a few years now.

324
00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:03.060
So 2008 I was wallowing in 2015 I was on the top of the world.

325
00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:07.380
I,
it was a great,
it was a year of great personal change,

326
00:22:07.381 --> 00:22:11.910
but at the beginning of it I felt so blessed with life's riches.

327
00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:15.870
I was so happy and grateful for having finally,

328
00:22:15.871 --> 00:22:20.520
after all that hard work,
creating stability in my life,

329
00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:24.690
I was in a long term serious relationship.
The intent to marry,

330
00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:29.810
I had professional opportunities that were just coming at me in ways I hadn't

331
00:22:29.821 --> 00:22:34.200
anticipated and I was really physically healthy and vivacious.

332
00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:39.440
Lice was good and then within a matter of months I broke off the relationship.

333
00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:47.300
I moved very suddenly and I learned I had a really serious health condition that

334
00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:52.780
demanded immediate attention.
And so the future,

335
00:22:52.781 --> 00:22:56.770
the one that I had only just a few months ago thought was,
you know,

336
00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:58.330
I'm not going to be perfect forever,

337
00:22:58.331 --> 00:23:03.220
but I could just maybe take a breath for a while,
was no longer that,

338
00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:04.121
that safety,

339
00:23:04.121 --> 00:23:08.500
that security blanket was now devastatingly uncertain.

340
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:13.910
Okay.
If we go back to failure,
failure is really just change.

341
00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:18.560
That's all it is.
And change is always present.

342
00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:20.150
It's constant.

343
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:24.830
So the sooner we learn to flourish in change,

344
00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:27.590
in transition,
the better off we'll be.

345
00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:32.660
So what is transition?
What does it mean to be in transition?

346
00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:38.180
William Bridges outlines three phases of transition and I find these to be

347
00:23:38.181 --> 00:23:41.600
pretty accurate.
There's endings first one,
the endings,

348
00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:46.160
then it's the neutral zone and then it's new.
So for me,

349
00:23:46.161 --> 00:23:49.850
the end of my relationship is ending period.

350
00:23:49.851 --> 00:23:53.750
Just like it is with any relationship.
And I'm sure you can relate to this,

351
00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:58.810
it brings up feelings of nostalgia where you're not really sure if you're

352
00:24:00.171 --> 00:24:05.171
missing the person or you're missing the idea of the person or the romanticized

353
00:24:07.101 --> 00:24:09.710
notion of them are really just that familiarity.

354
00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:12.620
And then once you get a little bit of distance,

355
00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:16.370
you're left kind of shivering alone in the neutral zone.

356
00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:20.840
That's where the emptiness really starts to settle and it's hard to move into

357
00:24:20.841 --> 00:24:21.674
that phase.

358
00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:27.280
And for anyone who's ever had a serious illness or anyone close to you has

359
00:24:28.131 --> 00:24:29.840
experienced that you,

360
00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:34.190
you understand the huge weight of medical uncertainty.

361
00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:39.380
Our need for closure is so high at that point.
We just want to know,

362
00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:43.700
we want to know what is happening,
even if it's bad,
we want that certainty,

363
00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:45.920
but science,

364
00:24:45.921 --> 00:24:50.921
even science and maybe especially science often can't give that to us and so

365
00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:53.690
we're,

366
00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:58.400
we're left just hovering without hard answers.

367
00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:02.060
Then we ultimately get to the new beginning phase,

368
00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:07.780
the pangs of heartbreak flipped to the side and new love interests come forward

369
00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:13.450
and after difficult procedures and surgery and all sorts of medical drama,

370
00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:22.180
you slip into a new phase of perpetual monitoring.

371
00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:26.750
Not I'm healthy forever,
but perpetual monitoring,

372
00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:31.190
which really is a constant reminder of both the fragility,

373
00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:36.210
I think and the resilience of the human body and we can never effect,

374
00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:41.240
we can never anticipate how the effect that these events will have on us.

375
00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:44.630
For me.
I thought I was going to panic,

376
00:25:44.631 --> 00:25:48.650
that I was going to have so much anxiety that I wasn't actually going to move

377
00:25:48.651 --> 00:25:50.240
forward in my life,

378
00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:55.250
and that was not the way I responded in this particular moment.

379
00:25:55.370 --> 00:26:00.370
This strange wave of calm washed over me and maybe at times that have been

380
00:26:03.171 --> 00:26:05.450
really difficult.
Some of you have felt that too,

381
00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:10.570
where you surprise yourself and the way that you actually deal with trauma and

382
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:14.030
everyday was a new puzzle to solve.

383
00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:17.450
It gave me a sense of purpose and I knew that those small victories,

384
00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:21.140
just knowing what was supposed to come next was enough.

385
00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:26.980
And so it's at those moments that we realize that we're in a state of permanent

386
00:26:28.641 --> 00:26:29.474
transition,

387
00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:34.960
that we can slip into what I call blissful uncertainty and just exist there

388
00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:41.840
because that notion of stability is,
is false,

389
00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:46.440
and that blissful uncertainty can actually be more calming than you think it is

390
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:50.580
if you allow it to exist with you.
So we're forced to exit.

391
00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.710
Sometimes we make these big exits.

392
00:26:52.711 --> 00:26:57.300
We need to make changes at these moments in our lives.
And sometimes the biggest,

393
00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:02.480
best exits that we make are the ones that we never anticipated or planned for.

394
00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:09.380
So how can you make the most of change and not be derailed by it?

395
00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:10.741
Well,

396
00:27:10.741 --> 00:27:15.741
we can keep our minds right for change and ready for change,

397
00:27:16.291 --> 00:27:21.291
and you can be the boss of change if you adapt an always be changing mindset.

398
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:26.190
So how do you do that one,
disrupt your assumptions.

399
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:29.190
That's something that startups do all the time.

400
00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:34.730
They don't take over industries by doing things the way it's always been done.

401
00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:38.490
They're poking holes in it,
they're unlearning.

402
00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:43.020
And so we spend so much time learning that sometimes we forget that unlearning

403
00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:48.200
is where we actually learn the most and grow the most bucking conventional

404
00:27:48.391 --> 00:27:49.380
wisdom,
for instance,

405
00:27:49.381 --> 00:27:53.430
disrupting those mental models that kind of hold us hostage to operating in

406
00:27:53.431 --> 00:27:57.690
particular ways.
We can also capitalize on endings.
You know,

407
00:27:57.900 --> 00:27:58.860
when you're in transition,

408
00:27:58.861 --> 00:28:02.430
and I know this from a lot of the work I do with both individuals and large

409
00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:03.750
corporations,

410
00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:09.840
when you're at a moment of of transition or you failed at something or you've

411
00:28:09.841 --> 00:28:14.160
been humbled in some way,
you are so ripe for growth,

412
00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:17.010
you're ready for it.
You're just soaking it all in.

413
00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:22.160
So use those moments to just take it in and get to the next level in a way that

414
00:28:22.681 --> 00:28:26.670
you're really almost immune to when you're floating up here thinking that

415
00:28:26.671 --> 00:28:29.220
everything in life is,
is going your way.

416
00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:33.060
Because what happens then is you're in a place of complacency and complacency is

417
00:28:33.061 --> 00:28:35.520
a really dangerous place to operate from.

418
00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:40.860
And the other thing you can do to be the boss of change is to ritualize closure.

419
00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:46.050
The great mythologist Joseph Campbell,
one of my favorites,

420
00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:50.970
said that we have to be willing to get rid of the life we've planned so as to

421
00:28:50.971 --> 00:28:52.860
have the life that's waiting for us.

422
00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:58.370
And so finding a way to re ritualized closures even when it's something that you

423
00:28:58.381 --> 00:29:02.820
don't want to end,
can be really rewarding and help you to move forward.

424
00:29:02.821 --> 00:29:04.710
Not to forsake the past,

425
00:29:04.711 --> 00:29:09.690
but to open yourself to and guide yourself into the future.

426
00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:11.190
Okay,
five

427
00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:13.403
<v 1>play.</v>

428
00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:18.020
<v 0>This is,
you might be wondering why this one's in here.
Uh,</v>

429
00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:23.590
so we are the source of our own fulfillment,
plain and simple.

430
00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:27.130
But the challenge is asking yourself,

431
00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:31.630
figuring out what is it you're actually seeking,
what are you looking for?

432
00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:36.900
And Are you doing the right things to allow it to find you and you defined it.

433
00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:40.930
So how do we do that?
Well,
I would,

434
00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:45.910
that play is one of the ways that we can do it.
Now,

435
00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:50.860
clay is a tough one because you don't look,
this is a room of overachievers,

436
00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:54.700
right?
You guys are gainfully employed,
everyone's intelligent.

437
00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:57.010
Where does play fit into your life?

438
00:29:57.011 --> 00:30:00.250
And maybe you're more enlightened than the average and you're like,
oh,

439
00:30:00.251 --> 00:30:03.640
I always play every day from five to seven or whatever.

440
00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.700
So maybe you got that part figured out.
For most of us,

441
00:30:06.701 --> 00:30:11.701
we might intend to play easy to fall off of our to do list as as adults because

442
00:30:12.511 --> 00:30:16.770
play is this special thing that is not part of your normal everyday life.

443
00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:19.530
It's time out of time.
It's separate.

444
00:30:19.531 --> 00:30:23.290
It's not about producing something that can be measured.

445
00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:28.110
There's no real data around play per se.

446
00:30:28.111 --> 00:30:33.111
So it can be come hard if you're scientifically oriented to justify its presence

447
00:30:33.421 --> 00:30:33.990
in your life.

448
00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:38.880
But really it's through play that we not only prepare for change,

449
00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:43.910
but open ourselves to the possibilities that expand beyond our immediate lives.

450
00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:47.850
That help us to reimagine our lives in different ways.

451
00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:51.690
So instead of asking who has time for play,

452
00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:57.050
ask yourself if you can afford not to play the philosopher Ludvig Vicodins Dean

453
00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:02.490
said that if people did not,
sometimes you silly things,

454
00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:04.650
nothing important would ever get done.

455
00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:08.070
And so if you think of play no other way,

456
00:31:08.071 --> 00:31:10.860
just think of it that it makes really good sense.

457
00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:14.550
So how do you find your play outlets and how do you know if they're working?

458
00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:17.340
Well,
I'm in a decade ago,

459
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:21.420
I joined very accidentally,

460
00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:25.860
the Central Park Dance Skaters Association.
Anyone ever seen them?

461
00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:27.720
Ah,

462
00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:32.720
well they are a nonprofit group of really bright and amazing individuals who

463
00:31:36.211 --> 00:31:38.670
skate in New York,
Central Park.
Um,

464
00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:43.700
there's barricades that are set up and a with a DJ in the middle that plays old

465
00:31:44.431 --> 00:31:49.431
school soul and house music and everyone is welcome to join their barricades,

466
00:31:50.281 --> 00:31:53.520
but it's one of the most inclusive group you'll ever see.

467
00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:56.220
Even if you can't skate,
they don't care.
They want you to join.

468
00:31:56.221 --> 00:32:00.960
There's one elderly regular that goes there and he just literally bounces up and

469
00:32:00.961 --> 00:32:04.890
down and people skate around him and he's a huge tourist attraction,

470
00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:07.540
but the,
the,

471
00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:12.560
the group is colorful as I'm painting it out to be there as lady fleet flowness

472
00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.710
as his actual,
uh,
skate name.

473
00:32:15.711 --> 00:32:20.180
We all escaped names and he comes in and is half electric,

474
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:24.320
green dragon bicycle wearing clothes.

475
00:32:24.321 --> 00:32:29.300
He has embroidered with his name all over it,
peddling his latest mix CD.

476
00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:32.780
Or there's the shirtless guy who,
uh,

477
00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:38.080
skates with water bottles stacked on his head or the other shirtless guy who

478
00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:41.630
skates backwards and just flexes his pecs.

479
00:32:41.631 --> 00:32:43.940
And I've never seen either of them put their shirts on no matter how cold it

480
00:32:43.941 --> 00:32:46.760
gets.
Or there's my favorites,

481
00:32:46.761 --> 00:32:51.230
the Hollywood roller twins who are neither affiliated with Hollywood nor twins.

482
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:56.130
Um,
but they do have a choreographed routines that they,

483
00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:58.820
that they do and they always dress alike.

484
00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:02.270
And I've known them for 10 years and I still can't tell them apart.

485
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:08.000
Or the recently deceased octogenarian leader Leslie,
who only wore purple,

486
00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:12.110
his house was all purple and he got married on his roller skates.
So this place,

487
00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:15.560
the skate circle,
it is an adult play pen.

488
00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:19.180
It is one of the happiest places you can ever walk into.

489
00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:24.220
I've been sad or depressed or hung over and I've walked into the skate circle

490
00:33:24.321 --> 00:33:28.280
and suddenly everything in life is perfect and great.

491
00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:32.840
And I know you've felt a place like that in your life where you walk there and

492
00:33:32.841 --> 00:33:37.760
nothing else matters.
So for some people it's as simple as jumping in the ocean,

493
00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:41.150
but in that space,
the soulful music,

494
00:33:41.151 --> 00:33:45.380
the physical flow state that you go into,
the community that's there,

495
00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:48.830
it's nothing short of magical.
And I think that's,

496
00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:52.340
that's the thing that's hard to capture as adults.
Magic.

497
00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:57.110
It's the stuff that we believed as kids,
the magic carpets and you know,

498
00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:01.730
this object would have some special powers and we kind of get it at the box

499
00:34:01.731 --> 00:34:05.900
office with superhero movies and maybe star wars.

500
00:34:05.901 --> 00:34:10.901
But outside of the theater it's really hard to find magic in our everyday lives.

501
00:34:12.890 --> 00:34:17.890
And so in spaces like the skate circle where I don't actually know anyone's last

502
00:34:18.441 --> 00:34:21.580
name,
I've had these people in my home many times,

503
00:34:21.581 --> 00:34:24.130
I don't know what they do for a living when they're not skating.

504
00:34:24.490 --> 00:34:29.490
And I refuse to ask them because somehow the stark realities of everyday life

505
00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:35.430
seem offensive to the magic and the sacredness of that space.

506
00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:39.070
So when I'm not rollerskating,

507
00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:43.960
I am what you might call a karaoke enthusiast and

508
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:45.150
<v 1>okay.</v>

509
00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:49.570
<v 0>Do you have any karaoke lovers here?
Maybe.
All right.
Uh,</v>

510
00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:53.980
so that was not always the case.
Um,
I was shy at first and,
uh,

511
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:57.750
I would go some friends to a midtown dive bar and they would sing there duets

512
00:34:57.751 --> 00:34:59.970
and that would be really jealous and wish I could sing with them.

513
00:34:59.971 --> 00:35:02.130
And then one day I was like,
that's it.
I'm going to do it.

514
00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:06.510
And I sang Elvira by the Oak Ridge boys.
Anyone ever heard of that song?

515
00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:10.710
It was an old country western song.
That was my first 45,

516
00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.410
and it was kinda good.

517
00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:17.590
And so then I started doing a little Linda Ronstadt and some dusty Springfield

518
00:35:18.141 --> 00:35:21.020
and a little Gladys knight,
and suddenly had the bug.

519
00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:24.560
And so I started hosting with some friends,

520
00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:29.510
some monthly Karaoke parties in Manhattan,
everywhere from Tiki bars too,

521
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:34.740
underground basement bars.
And some of them were wild and costumes,

522
00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:36.270
like our pants,

523
00:35:36.271 --> 00:35:40.950
optional Ballantine's Karaoke parties or the annual holiday,

524
00:35:40.951 --> 00:35:43.080
Santa's Oki gathering.

525
00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:48.480
But we always had the Roman cow bell and the tambourines and the taxidermy

526
00:35:48.481 --> 00:35:51.420
mascots,
uh,
that would sing with people.

527
00:35:51.421 --> 00:35:55.830
And it was everyone from bankers and lawyers to technologists and artists.

528
00:35:56.310 --> 00:36:00.030
And it was,
again,

529
00:36:00.031 --> 00:36:05.031
it was this happy place that I didn't seek out any more that I sought out the

530
00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:08.730
skate circle and I didn't make a cent on this.

531
00:36:08.731 --> 00:36:13.731
And it certainly did not progress my career in any meaningful way immediately.

532
00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:19.760
And yet it was an important part of creating the happiness that I needed.

533
00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:28.310
So our life pivots don't always come from the things that we anticipate that

534
00:36:29.821 --> 00:36:30.654
they will.

535
00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:35.930
Our career trajectories don't always lead from the things like the,

536
00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:39.870
the degree or the promotion.

537
00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:45.150
Couple of years ago I was feeling stuck professionally,
personally,

538
00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:50.780
and so I decided to impose a six month limit for my unhappiness that I had to

539
00:36:53.101 --> 00:36:57.120
make a move,
that I had to do something to radically shake up my life.

540
00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:02.540
I explored going to Afghanistan in working as a social scientist with the troops

541
00:37:03.451 --> 00:37:06.090
there.
Or the other option was I was going to move to California.

542
00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:11.040
My mom was very happy that I chose the latter actually.
Uh,

543
00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:15.960
but moving to California was not a choice that I made because it was so obvious

544
00:37:15.961 --> 00:37:20.490
for my career and that's how I made all the other choices in my life that far.

545
00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:21.600
Uh,

546
00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:26.040
it was the choice that I made because I knew that's where I felt like the best

547
00:37:26.041 --> 00:37:27.150
version of myself.

548
00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:31.560
It's where I felt like I could actually finally flourish as a person.

549
00:37:31.561 --> 00:37:35.400
And I felt that if I did that,
other things would follow.

550
00:37:35.730 --> 00:37:38.340
And sure enough they did.

551
00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:43.370
But the mere imaginings of allowing myself to extend beyond what felt really,

552
00:37:44.101 --> 00:37:49.101
really practical suddenly opened up a world that I have you been anticipating.

553
00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:54.230
I needed that giant pivot to allow myself to go beyond practicality because it's

554
00:37:54.451 --> 00:37:58.950
not about practicality or passion.
Those two things are not at odds.

555
00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:00.600
It's about both.

556
00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:04.260
And it's about allowing play in magic in your life.

557
00:38:04.261 --> 00:38:07.560
It's about giving yourself the opportunity to follow your heart,

558
00:38:07.561 --> 00:38:11.580
knowing that there's also a practical application for the decisions that you're

559
00:38:11.581 --> 00:38:13.800
making.
So it asks you again,

560
00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:19.580
what is it that you see and are you allowing it to find you?

561
00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:23.880
Do you have the permission to fantasize?

562
00:38:23.881 --> 00:38:27.900
And dream in the ways that might seem silly at first,

563
00:38:27.901 --> 00:38:32.901
that might seem unnecessarily playful because fantasies start to become a

564
00:38:33.871 --> 00:38:38.871
reality at the intersection of your practical accomplishments and your

565
00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:39.883
daydreams,

566
00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:44.200
not just at the part of your career that you've planned out for the next 20

567
00:38:44.201 --> 00:38:44.920
years.

568
00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:49.920
So there's three simple things that I want to leave you with as you remember and

569
00:38:51.011 --> 00:38:52.690
start to start up your life.

570
00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:57.520
One is to return to your core startups,

571
00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:02.740
push out MVPs all the time,
minimum viable products,
right?
They're lean,

572
00:39:02.741 --> 00:39:03.670
they're simple,

573
00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:07.150
they do something really well and they get it right and it resonates with
people.

574
00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:12.880
But as we get older,
we things layer the should'ves layer,

575
00:39:12.881 --> 00:39:14.650
the nice to haves layer,

576
00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:19.300
and it becomes difficult to know what is really our core.

577
00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:23.020
So ask yourself,
what's your mantra?
How can you slip?

578
00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:28.350
How can you strip away the layers that have bogged you down and get back to

579
00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:32.260
what's at the core of everything you do?

580
00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:36.940
See if you can do that and then give yourself permission to let go of the other

581
00:39:36.941 --> 00:39:40.210
stuff that doesn't actively contribute to that core.

582
00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:43.720
The second thing is to settle for good enough.

583
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:47.440
Sometimes the practical application of,

584
00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:51.460
of finding joy in the process is not really sexy.

585
00:39:51.461 --> 00:39:56.050
Sometimes you have to settle for good enough so that you had the chance at

586
00:39:56.051 --> 00:39:58.840
something that's really,
really great.

587
00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:02.500
We are multidimensional,
imperfect creatures,

588
00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:05.980
but perfectionism is paralyzing a lot of the time.

589
00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:08.050
And that's where that fear comes back in.

590
00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:12.430
So remember Eleanor Roosevelt's words,

591
00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:16.240
you don't have to become a hero overnight.

592
00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:18.490
The arc of your life is long.

593
00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:22.390
Your ability to turn failures into successes is long.

594
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:25.240
The arc of your happiness is long.

595
00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:31.080
And finally three to serve others is to serve yourself a useful life is a happy

596
00:40:33.701 --> 00:40:38.230
life.
And all truism and ambition are not at odds with one another.

597
00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:43.030
And we might not like everything that we see happening in the world around us,

598
00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:45.490
but we get to design our own lives.

599
00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:50.520
We get to decide what our legacy is going to be and how we touch the community

600
00:40:50.681 --> 00:40:54.940
is that we are a part of.
And that's really empowering and helpful.

601
00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:58.810
So at the end of each chapter in my book,

602
00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:01.660
I offer what I call the lazy low down,

603
00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:04.720
and essentially it's the top 10 chapter takeaways.

604
00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:07.360
And so in case he dozed off at any point,

605
00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:12.660
I'm going to leave you with the top 10 lazy load down from this presentation.

606
00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:17.350
One personal fulfillment is created,

607
00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:22.380
not inherited or earned to hap hazard search for happiness leads unpredictable

608
00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:28.070
intermittent results,
not sustainable wellbeing.
Three,

609
00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:32.450
hustle trumps pedigree.
It keeps you hungry,

610
00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:36.170
and hunger always beats complacency.
Four,

611
00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:40.340
give yourself permission to fail and you require the ability to succeed.

612
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:43.880
Five,
get barreled by fear.

613
00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:48.890
Hang 10 on it's frothy swell and enjoy the ride.
Six,

614
00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:53.300
embrace a life in transition because change is not coming.

615
00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:56.570
It's already here.
Seven,

616
00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:01.010
it's never too early or too late to reinvent yourself.

617
00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:05.210
So pivot your life toward happiness.
Eight,

618
00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:06.770
get serious.

619
00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:11.870
Start playing nine champion.
Good enough.

620
00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:16.900
So you have a chance at really great and 10 become an MVP,

621
00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:22.250
returned to your core or just discover it for the first time.

622
00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:25.800
Thank you for your time and attention.
And I'll open the,

623
00:42:30.610 --> 00:42:35.340
<v 3>you mentioned about ritualizing and things closer.
Yeah,
yeah.</v>

624
00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:36.920
What's your marathon?
Of course,
I'm going to read it.

625
00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:43.000
Whether you meant which is have a ritual to Newcomb or whether we should make it

626
00:42:43.001 --> 00:42:47.600
a habit of forcing ourselves trends every so often.
All of the chapters.

627
00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:49.180
<v 0>Ah,
yeah.
Well,</v>

628
00:42:49.181 --> 00:42:53.530
I think the original intention is to,
you know,

629
00:42:53.590 --> 00:42:57.700
life doesn't always give us the neat and tidy endings that we want,

630
00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:03.040
whether it's professionally or personally.
We're often left hanging a little bit,

631
00:43:03.041 --> 00:43:07.300
and so you have to create your own closure.
And for a lot of us,

632
00:43:07.301 --> 00:43:10.900
that gives us peace of minds if we're able to ritualize closure and it makes it

633
00:43:10.901 --> 00:43:14.860
easier to move forward.
But I think to your other option,

634
00:43:14.861 --> 00:43:19.600
that's also really important to know when enough is enough.
You know?

635
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:24.070
So I'm saying,
you know,
embrace risk and fear the,
no,

636
00:43:24.071 --> 00:43:28.210
you're no,
you're breaking point.
No,
no.
When it's okay.

637
00:43:28.270 --> 00:43:31.980
You don't have to be a hero overnight.
Thank you very much.
Yeah.
Thank you.

638
00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:32.790
<v 1>Thanks for coming.</v>
