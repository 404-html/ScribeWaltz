1
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.400
Well,
welcome.
Thank you very much for coming today.
My name is Charles Hilton.

2
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.790
I am a social entrepreneur,

3
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.060
meaning that I use this business principles and social market issues,

4
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.100
market issues to deal with social issues.

5
00:00:20.101 --> 00:00:23.280
I had represent four different organizations here.
Uh,

6
00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:27.210
the one that you might know the best is the rice man here.
Second Harvest Japan.

7
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.230
And so today I'm gonna talk to you about how to motivate,

8
00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:36.231
how we use a concept here called starting with why and basically the three parts

9
00:00:36.501 --> 00:00:39.090
of this presentation right now and tell you a little bit about,

10
00:00:39.091 --> 00:00:41.400
more about myself and what we do at second harvest.

11
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.730
I'm going to show you the whole video from Simon Sinek.

12
00:00:44.731 --> 00:00:48.660
Has Anybody seen his video?
You have?
Okay,
good.

13
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.370
Well hope you're not bored to see it again.

14
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.060
And then I'm going to show you how we apply it at our organization and because

15
00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:58.920
we found that this be very important.
So let's just get started.

16
00:00:58.921 --> 00:01:01.830
I want to show you a quick video of Lou about what we do.

17
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.180
<v 0>I am</v>

18
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.400
[inaudible]

19
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.553
Stop,

20
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.930
stop.

21
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.220
<v 1>So I love this picture here because it illustrates clearly what we do.</v>

22
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.950
All that food and all the food that you saw in that video,

23
00:03:22.951 --> 00:03:24.960
there would have been food and thrown away.

24
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:27.200
<v 0>Okay.</v>

25
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.200
<v 1>It's a cost to the donor to throw it away and no company or personal interest.</v>

26
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.780
He wants to throw away food but they don't know where to get it to.

27
00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.990
We come in,
this is my staff,
my former staff,

28
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.760
pick it up and get out to people for them and now has value.

29
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.050
But in that process of picking it up,
what used to be a problem,

30
00:03:48.051 --> 00:03:52.880
a cost to that donor company is now a value.
They can say they're doing CSR.

31
00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.290
They could say that they're engaging the community and their staff feel better

32
00:03:57.291 --> 00:03:59.300
about the company,
feel better about their product,

33
00:03:59.301 --> 00:04:02.150
knowing that it goes right back into the community to be used that day.

34
00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.400
On the recipient side of it,

35
00:04:04.401 --> 00:04:07.730
obviously they can use the food and nourish himself with food is also a tool for

36
00:04:07.731 --> 00:04:08.564
communication,

37
00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.980
particularly single mother households where quite often the mothers are buying

38
00:04:12.981 --> 00:04:16.370
separate vendors to feed the children now with food.
They can,

39
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.650
they can cook together as a way to communicate.

40
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:23.110
So this is really kind of encapsulates what we're trying to do,

41
00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.400
make food available to anybody in need,

42
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.630
but to kind of understand our philosophy and where it comes from and who we are

43
00:04:33.241 --> 00:04:35.580
today.
Need to go back 20 years ago.

44
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.280
So I've been in now in Japan for over 26 years and lived in a poor section of

45
00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:43.290
Tokyo,
made a self help center there.

46
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.430
But by the end of 1996 I had questions about the viability of that.

47
00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.290
And so I chose to go live along the submitter river and only intended to be

48
00:04:52.291 --> 00:04:54.720
there for three months.
It's good to see you again.

49
00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.470
And I ended up staying there 15 months and it completely changed my worldview.

50
00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.210
It's one thing to think about poverty,

51
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.920
one thing about hunger in the comfort of one's own home or in academia,

52
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.020
it's quite different than when you have people living to the left and right.

53
00:05:12.021 --> 00:05:14.440
He viewed no more than two or three meters away.

54
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.250
That struggle with that issue you each and every day and asking yourself,

55
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.780
what should I do?
What can I do?
What is my responsibility here?

56
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.030
And so while I knew these people many years before I went to go live down there,

57
00:05:28.031 --> 00:05:30.190
it was quite new experience to come down here as we say,

58
00:05:30.191 --> 00:05:34.780
live in the Gemba to live side by side together and it completely changed my

59
00:05:34.781 --> 00:05:35.614
mind.

60
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.170
<v 0>Okay.</v>

61
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.740
<v 1>One day I was looking over the river just like this,</v>

62
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:45.060
contemplated thinking about the men and think about how people thought about the

63
00:05:45.061 --> 00:05:47.900
men and and some people think that their cow ISO,

64
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.300
some people think that they're there.
Joshua,
why are they down there?

65
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.400
And I thought about my own life here in Japan up to that point and some people

66
00:05:56.401 --> 00:06:00.140
would welcome me.
People had not welcomed me.
I've been discriminated against.

67
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.850
I thought about a child in Calcutta street,

68
00:06:04.851 --> 00:06:07.850
child in Calcutta was hungry and thought about their situation,

69
00:06:07.851 --> 00:06:12.560
how I felt when I saw that child in Calcutta and I thought about other social

70
00:06:12.561 --> 00:06:16.640
issues in the world.
Climate Change,
land mines in Afghanistan,
Hey,

71
00:06:16.641 --> 00:06:21.500
number one of these things and it came back to this phrase back over and over

72
00:06:21.501 --> 00:06:24.620
again.
You may be familiar with this phrase.
If you're not a part of the solution,

73
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.010
you're part of the problem.
If you're not a part of the solution,

74
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.590
you're part of the problem.
Over and over in my head,

75
00:06:30.591 --> 00:06:35.490
I'm thinking about this as I'm looking at these men.
I thought about the men.

76
00:06:35.491 --> 00:06:38.970
They didn't feel that way.
They didn't feel anybody else's responsible for them.

77
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.750
I thought about the discrimination I face and I didn't want anybody to fight my

78
00:06:42.751 --> 00:06:46.470
own battles,
not thought about that child and Calcutta and I said,
you know,

79
00:06:46.471 --> 00:06:50.520
I didn't make that child poor or knew him in the social issues

80
00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:57.660
and I had experienced it radically changed my whole worldview and an insight

81
00:06:57.661 --> 00:07:02.661
that I had was quite often westerners sense of guilt about the world's problems

82
00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:06.810
is deeply rooted in an exaggerated sense of responsibility

83
00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:13.730
that people feel over sense of responsibility for the world's problems and I

84
00:07:14.191 --> 00:07:18.750
shifted from feeling responsible for the world's problems to choosing to

85
00:07:18.751 --> 00:07:23.730
respond.
And I'll give you one just quick story here to clear,

86
00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.420
clarify how that plays out in my life.
Several years later,

87
00:07:27.421 --> 00:07:31.680
I was in Seattle with my brother who is five years younger,

88
00:07:31.681 --> 00:07:33.270
but probably two times bigger than I am.

89
00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:39.260
He's fairly muscular and I'm panhandler a guy begging for money,

90
00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.430
had the courage to come out to both of us and say,

91
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:45.180
can you spare $5 typical response,
typical thing,

92
00:07:45.181 --> 00:07:48.210
right and without thinking,
without even pausing,

93
00:07:48.211 --> 00:07:52.920
I turned in with no sarcasm of my boys.
I said,
I'll pass on that opportunity.

94
00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:55.520
My brother,
he walked away,

95
00:07:55.521 --> 00:07:57.270
he looked at me like this and my brother looked at me like,

96
00:07:57.271 --> 00:08:00.900
what the heck you're passing it,
the opportunity.
I said,
well,

97
00:08:00.901 --> 00:08:02.890
he gave me an opportunity to do something good and I,

98
00:08:02.891 --> 00:08:07.890
I just chose not to do that.
Now,
if I had not had that opportunity,

99
00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:12.120
that experience along the river,
I am most likely response would have been,

100
00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:13.950
well,
if I give him the money,

101
00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:17.910
he's going to use it for drinking or he doesn't look like he needs it or some

102
00:08:17.911 --> 00:08:20.250
reason why I didn't need to get them food,

103
00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:24.660
but what I was really kind of responding to there was I'm not responsible for

104
00:08:24.661 --> 00:08:25.494
him.

105
00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:32.200
Whereas now my worldview is I choose to respond to what we do.

106
00:08:32.201 --> 00:08:35.380
And we'll get into that in a minute here.
When we talk about second harvest,

107
00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:36.940
what our core why is

108
00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:42.460
that perspective that I had in that experience and we talked about and the other

109
00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:45.630
day and he talks about ICU is not unique.

110
00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:50.250
Meaning that all of us have these opportunities each and every day to step back

111
00:08:50.251 --> 00:08:51.390
and reflect on our life.

112
00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:57.320
What is day to day experiences mean to how do they reflect our,

113
00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:59.490
our values,
our worldview.

114
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.840
You don't need to live along Sumida river to have an insight like that.

115
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:07.700
And I want to share one more to you then.

116
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:12.710
I stumbled across in 2013 I was teaching at Sofia University in Geo management

117
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:17.220
and I stumbled across this video.
I'm a leader,

118
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:21.630
so this really spoke directly to me.
I said,
well,
let me look at it.
And I said,

119
00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:24.660
Oh my God,
this guy has been,

120
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:29.610
he's saying we are doing what he says we're doing,
but people would,
companies do.

121
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:35.340
And since that time we've used it to refocus who we are,

122
00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:36.540
how we approach things.

123
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:40.230
So we saw this last year's campaign almost played out just exactly.

124
00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:44.220
If you look at these two different candidates as your three different
candidates,

125
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:47.010
we clearly knew what Clinton wanted.
She wanted the presidency.

126
00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:51.720
She had a campaign to do that.
Talk badly about Trump.
How bad,

127
00:09:51.721 --> 00:09:53.310
how crazy he is.

128
00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:55.420
<v 2>Okay.</v>

129
00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:58.970
<v 1>Trump and Sanders.
Then inside,
clearly we knew what their why was.</v>

130
00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.640
You can debate what that exactly was,

131
00:10:01.641 --> 00:10:04.160
but there's no doubt among their supporters.

132
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:09.010
You knew exactly what their why was and how they connected with them was

133
00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:13.460
different ways.
Sanders,
very grounds,
grassroots,
Trump,

134
00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:16.520
big rallies and the what?
The idea of becoming president,

135
00:10:16.521 --> 00:10:18.530
it was almost an afterthought for both of them.

136
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:22.130
You can look at online articles and people consistently say,

137
00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:26.930
we don't know why Clinton ran.
We know she wanted to be the president,

138
00:10:26.931 --> 00:10:30.530
but what was your why?
But these two people,
there's clearly,

139
00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:34.160
and just as he was talking about the airplane and vendors,

140
00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:39.470
the Wright brothers and Samuel Pierpont Langley,
whereas Clinton today,

141
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:44.690
if she was truly about her wife changed in the country,
it wouldn't matter.

142
00:10:44.691 --> 00:10:45.860
She was a politician or not

143
00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:52.180
in our sense and who we are as an organization,
our core,
why

144
00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.260
we don't define what we do is helping people.

145
00:10:57.970 --> 00:10:58.740
<v 2>Okay.</v>

146
00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:01.890
<v 1>Set One more time.
We do not define what we do is helping people.</v>

147
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:06.780
We just love food banking.
We just love giving away food.

148
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.630
That me pause for a second and ask you how many people were surprised by that

149
00:11:12.631 --> 00:11:13.464
statement?

150
00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:14.700
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

151
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:17.760
<v 1>Coming from a nonprofit,
how many would you raise your hand if you like?
Yeah,</v>

152
00:11:17.761 --> 00:11:18.840
you're surprised,
right?

153
00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:20.843
<v 2>Right.</v>

154
00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:25.160
<v 1>But how many of you,
when I,
you heard me say we just love food banking.</v>

155
00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:29.420
You felt some energy,
you felt oh yeah.

156
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:33.620
Because almost every single time when I have one on one discussion with people

157
00:11:33.621 --> 00:11:38.240
and I say this,
I could see that people's face change and it's,

158
00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.670
it's not because they agree with me about giving away food.

159
00:11:40.671 --> 00:11:41.960
We'll talk about that in a second,

160
00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.680
but they can clearly identify and connect with my core why.

161
00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:50.260
You could see the energy in my face that came from that 20 years ago.

162
00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:55.300
Living along the river of choosing not to responsible but to responding.

163
00:11:55.601 --> 00:11:58.930
In my one of my responses to give away food.

164
00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:03.330
How do we do that?
Trust in inequality,

165
00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:05.830
trusting inequality.

166
00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:10.540
70% of Japanese distrust nonprofits,

167
00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:14.740
70% we're only less than 30% say that they would trust a nonprofit.

168
00:12:14.741 --> 00:12:19.690
Here in Japan,
we interface everyday with the food industry,

169
00:12:19.691 --> 00:12:24.691
which is probably the strictest standards in the world for food and the least

170
00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:29.320
risk adverse or the most risk is risk adverse.

171
00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:32.710
I think I always get that mistaken.
2014 United States,

172
00:12:32.711 --> 00:12:36.970
there were 3,400 people died from food poisoning or foodborne illnesses.

173
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.980
The United States,
320 million people.
That's not a lot of people.
Okay.

174
00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:46.060
Within the last five weeks over that number of people have died from gunshot

175
00:12:46.061 --> 00:12:48.820
wounds.
The United States,
so we're not talking about a lot of people,

176
00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:53.170
but that same year,
2014 in Japan,
just three people,

177
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.470
just three people died from food borne illnesses.

178
00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:00.790
Population of 120 million consuming nearly 89 million tons of food.

179
00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:02.710
We're importing and using it.

180
00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:06.520
That is not a lot to get to that level.

181
00:13:06.521 --> 00:13:09.970
You have to have NASA like standards free food.
You do not trust anybody.

182
00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:14.850
We say in Japan at the product is imperfect,
Pristina presentable.

183
00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.570
It doesn't get purchased.
That's the environment we were operating it,

184
00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:23.340
so we need to create trust and here's our,
here's the results.

185
00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:26.700
10 years ago we only had 15 companies.

186
00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:31.800
Now we have over 1300 here's the interesting thing.

187
00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.780
We don't do any solicitation.
We don't go around company,

188
00:13:35.781 --> 00:13:37.170
a company asking for food.

189
00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:42.560
All 1300 of those companies approached us and sat down with us and offered us an

190
00:13:44.281 --> 00:13:47.970
agreement and all 1300 companies.
We have what we call it,

191
00:13:47.971 --> 00:13:49.530
an equal relationship with them.

192
00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:55.240
Why is it so important for us?
It's not a matter of pride.

193
00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:59.330
It's a matter of our approach.
If we go around company company and say,

194
00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:03.280
I chammas unintentionally,
it puts the company above here.

195
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:07.090
It puts us down here so that when we pass out our food,

196
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:10.240
the people are down here and we're up here.

197
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:11.990
<v 2>Okay?</v>

198
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:16.910
<v 1>We see food as a tool.
Companies have pumps and patches.</v>

199
00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:20.720
People over here have bikes with flat tires.

200
00:14:20.721 --> 00:14:23.900
If we could make that lateral transfer.
That's all we want to be.

201
00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:28.190
That's all we want to do.
That equality part is important.

202
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:31.070
What I will tell a company,
it sits down in front of me.
I'll say,

203
00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:34.190
we are not interested in your food.

204
00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:38.100
We want a trusting relationship with you and we will match your pace for pace to

205
00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:43.360
achieve that and then I'll go on to give two examples and each they foods in

206
00:14:44.601 --> 00:14:49.190
2005 sign an agreement with us after just three short weeks but needs you.

207
00:14:49.191 --> 00:14:53.930
They foods is traditionally very,
very company,
a different company,

208
00:14:53.931 --> 00:14:58.370
which we never name but it's an actual fact.
Took us five years,

209
00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:02.600
five years.
See,
I don't want the food for them.

210
00:15:02.601 --> 00:15:07.100
What I want is then it gets so excited about what we do that till two or three

211
00:15:07.101 --> 00:15:09.800
other people and here it is right here.

212
00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:17.250
The what we do,
right?
You could find that on our homepage or an report.

213
00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:21.150
Obviously we provide food to people in a lot of different ways.

214
00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:24.480
This is the end result of what we do,
right?

215
00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:29.790
But when we talk about and think about us,
we go from how,
why,

216
00:15:29.791 --> 00:15:32.880
how,
what in our discussions,

217
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:38.720
we use this this week

218
00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:43.140
to work through a problem that we've had for many,

219
00:15:43.141 --> 00:15:47.670
many years and the problem and focus around the issue of food loss and food

220
00:15:47.671 --> 00:15:50.970
waste,
big topic in the,
in the media.
You know,

221
00:15:50.971 --> 00:15:52.590
if people talk about it all the time,
oh,

222
00:15:52.591 --> 00:15:55.540
there's one third of food is thrown away.
You know,

223
00:15:55.541 --> 00:16:00.060
a 25% of food is thrown away.
There's people hungry and stuff like this.

224
00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:01.283
Okay?

225
00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:02.670
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

226
00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:07.350
<v 1>But we all being in the field and being experts in this area knew that a lot of</v>

227
00:16:07.351 --> 00:16:11.370
what was being said was uninformed,
uneducated,
and unsupported.

228
00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:17.280
And so we would always criticize these,
these different activities,

229
00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:21.000
the zero and kitchen,
having to go window food laws,
all of these.

230
00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:24.840
And so my staff member candidates who says,
what are we gonna do?

231
00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:29.550
We can't run away from this issue.
People are always talking about it.
You know,

232
00:16:29.551 --> 00:16:32.540
we've gotta be part of the conversation even if no,
we don't believe in,

233
00:16:32.541 --> 00:16:35.580
in the movement.
Okay?
In other words,

234
00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:38.040
there are 155 definitions for food loss.

235
00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.040
Even countries that have a single definition,

236
00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:45.330
there's no way to measure how much food losses,
right?
If you can't measure it,

237
00:16:45.331 --> 00:16:49.110
you can't manage it.
Correct.
If the United States,
my country,

238
00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:53.940
the government reports anywhere from 33 million to 66 million,

239
00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.800
depending on what definition they use.
Okay,

240
00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:01.770
so how are we going to square this?
Well,

241
00:17:01.771 --> 00:17:05.460
we had good discussion and what we realize is that we were focusing on from the

242
00:17:05.461 --> 00:17:08.870
what side,
right?

243
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:12.440
And so we came back said,
what is our why?
What is our core?

244
00:17:12.441 --> 00:17:16.980
Why would just love to give away food?
Right?

245
00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.280
And so my staff and I each shared a story of that we own had,

246
00:17:20.281 --> 00:17:24.810
he went to India at one time and so a child was begging for food and instead of

247
00:17:24.811 --> 00:17:29.430
just giving the child food or money,
he said,
well come and not,
I'll feed you.

248
00:17:29.431 --> 00:17:34.130
And he ended up feeding 10 of his family members at a restaurant.
No,

249
00:17:34.131 --> 00:17:38.690
I shared in my mind as a child not having enough food,
not having lunches.

250
00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:43.310
And what that meant to me,
and now have an opportunity to give away food,

251
00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.570
right?
And then we thought about,
well,
wait a minute,
these people over here,

252
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:53.190
you know,
what's,
what's going on there at their core,
they're why.
Well,

253
00:17:53.191 --> 00:17:57.300
food is life,
right?
Our fondest,

254
00:17:57.301 --> 00:17:59.550
deepest memories are usually connected to food,

255
00:17:59.551 --> 00:18:02.970
whether it be a wedding holidays,

256
00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:07.140
when we feel bad and good,
good food,
right?

257
00:18:07.141 --> 00:18:09.810
Maybe our mothers might've made us food that comfort us,

258
00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:14.340
but food is such an integral part of us and the t that thrown away,
right?

259
00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:19.200
I love Japanese phrase of [inaudible],
but we said,
hey,
you know what?

260
00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:20.610
How about we,
we,

261
00:18:20.611 --> 00:18:25.611
we focus on it here and then we talk about how we can use that food as life.

262
00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:32.220
This is the intersectionality and avoid all this.

263
00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:34.600
<v 2>Okay?</v>

264
00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:39.600
<v 1>And suddenly we went from being confrontational each time about their what to</v>

265
00:18:41.381 --> 00:18:46.381
refocusing on what is important to us and how can we talk about food loss and

266
00:18:46.781 --> 00:18:51.280
food waste in a way that reflects our values in a way that doesn't alienate

267
00:18:51.281 --> 00:18:55.690
other people.
The last one,
and it's important with this discussion,

268
00:18:55.691 --> 00:19:00.340
is that I can go down and tell you all the things that are wrong with here,

269
00:19:00.341 --> 00:19:04.570
with numbers and facts and figures.
That's all that is,
is facts and figures,

270
00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:09.880
but I tell you a story about myself,
right?
I'm not having enough,

271
00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:15.540
you know,
food for breakfast or not being able to,
you know,
have lunch or my,

272
00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:20.020
my call,
they can tell you about him sharing dinner.
That's a memory.

273
00:19:20.021 --> 00:19:22.060
That's an experience that you can remember,

274
00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:23.673
<v 2>all right?</v>

275
00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:29.600
<v 1>And that can motivate us that then how does it,
how can we share more food?</v>

276
00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:37.090
Our vision is by 2020 that we want to make food available to 100,000 people,

277
00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:44.360
right?
Currently there are about 2.2 million people that lack food security.

278
00:19:44.361 --> 00:19:46.670
The vast majority of these people are elderly.

279
00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:52.780
The national population for homeless is only around 6,200 nationally.

280
00:19:53.061 --> 00:19:55.940
In Tokyo it's less than 2000 okay.

281
00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:59.780
The vast majority of people that are in need are not living on the streets.

282
00:19:59.781 --> 00:20:03.890
They're living in houses and apartments to get access to food.

283
00:20:03.891 --> 00:20:07.880
This week in New York City,
they're 1100 different locations to pick up food.

284
00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:12.110
Even nearby Hong Kong,
he has 200 has 160 Tokyo,

285
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:14.060
maybe six.

286
00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:17.810
And I'm not referring to church groups or other faith based groups that provide

287
00:20:17.811 --> 00:20:19.040
only Gideon the park.

288
00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:23.240
I'm talking where you can pick up a basket of food to feed your family for three

289
00:20:23.241 --> 00:20:25.010
or four days.
Okay.

290
00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:29.390
So we think of it like climbing a mountain some ways and our first step up that

291
00:20:29.391 --> 00:20:33.950
mountain by 2020 is the each 100,000 our big goal,
right?

292
00:20:33.951 --> 00:20:34.660
The big one.

293
00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:39.660
You know that we hope to get there some days that everybody has enough food and

294
00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:43.520
we want to think of it like a public service,
a public asset.

295
00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:45.890
I live way out in the countryside.

296
00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.730
It takes me about almost hours to get home every day.

297
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:54.000
I almost never use the public library,
you know?

298
00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:56.700
But if I felt the public library wasn't there,

299
00:20:56.701 --> 00:21:01.530
I would feel a public asset was gone as valuable to me.

300
00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.260
I'm happy to pay taxes to make sure that library open,

301
00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:06.930
because it's not just a place for people to read books,

302
00:21:06.931 --> 00:21:09.540
but it's a place for people to get knowledge of people,

303
00:21:09.541 --> 00:21:14.160
to experience a different world,
a place for people to share information.

304
00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:19.370
It's valuable to us and that's how we want to see what of Satan ideas is that

305
00:21:19.681 --> 00:21:23.970
even if you don't use it today,
somebody in the community might navel to use it.

306
00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:28.230
And even if you may never experienced food insecurity,

307
00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.770
you know what it's like to have everybody at the table.

308
00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:35.760
And if I were to ask you this,
take a step just for a second,

309
00:21:35.761 --> 00:21:40.761
and imagine that every single child in Tokyo by 2020 could go to school on a

310
00:21:41.521 --> 00:21:45.730
full stomach.
How would that feel?
Yeah.

311
00:21:45.731 --> 00:21:47.680
For me personally,
it makes me feel good.

312
00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:52.180
Even though I don't know all of those children.
We have plenty of food.

313
00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:58.180
So this is where your opportunity to respond,
you know,

314
00:21:58.181 --> 00:21:59.290
to partner with us.

315
00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:03.700
Use Your talents to help us to get food.

316
00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:09.600
All right?
There's different ways you can interact with us to make that happen.

317
00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.740
I know some of you are coming out tomorrow.
That's great.

318
00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:16.830
And then also financially,
if you've ever donated to us financially,

319
00:22:16.831 --> 00:22:19.860
you may want to know what impact does that have for every thousand yen.

320
00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:23.400
You deliberate,
you donate to us.
We can deliver 40 meals.

321
00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:28.050
We arrive at that number by taking our total costs overhead,

322
00:22:28.051 --> 00:22:32.190
everything and dividing by the number of meals that we were able to deliver last

323
00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:33.330
year.
Okay,

324
00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:42.520
Libby,
last two quotes here.
I love these um,
one by Martin Luther King,

325
00:22:42.521 --> 00:22:46.810
but Pete plays on Hillel,
the elder,
uh,
if not us then who,
if not now,

326
00:22:46.811 --> 00:22:51.811
then when we reflect that in that internally that we don't want to assign this

327
00:22:52.001 --> 00:22:55.840
work to other people,
wait for other people to take action,

328
00:22:55.841 --> 00:23:00.370
but we want to do something and we want to do whatever we can do today and not

329
00:23:00.371 --> 00:23:04.030
wait till we retire or wait till something changes in our life.

330
00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:06.760
Even a small action today could have a big impact.

331
00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:10.990
The second one doe speaks more deeply to us as an organization.

332
00:23:10.991 --> 00:23:15.010
How we see the world.
It comes from Robert Kennedy there.
Those,

333
00:23:15.011 --> 00:23:18.220
look at the things where they are and ask why I do my things that never were,

334
00:23:18.221 --> 00:23:23.050
and ask why not?
Instead of focusing on why is there all this food waste,

335
00:23:23.051 --> 00:23:25.900
why isn't the government do something more?
Why we want to say,

336
00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.210
what would it look like if you and I partnered?

337
00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:32.020
What would it look like if you and I put our heads together?

338
00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:37.830
What would that banquet table look like if we took some action today to make

339
00:23:38.141 --> 00:23:41.110
something happen,
to focus on what the possibilities are?

340
00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:44.080
There's a lot more information on our website here.

341
00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:48.020
It's bilingual and you can download some information.

342
00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.600
Thank you very much for your time today.
Thank you.

343
00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:54.070
[inaudible].
