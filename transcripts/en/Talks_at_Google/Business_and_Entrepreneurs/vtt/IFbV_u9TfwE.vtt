release.
And here's London.

17
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.550
Good afternoon.
Thank you Jillian so much for hosting me.
Thanks to Google.

18
00:01:16.551 --> 00:01:19.460
Thank you guys for spending your lunch time with me.

19
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.260
I'm really excited to be here today and talk to you about living while on the

20
00:01:24.261 --> 00:01:28.760
road or what I also call how to plan a business trip that doesn't kill you.

21
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.030
Very important in the day and age that we work in.

22
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.350
So who am I and why am I here to talk to you about this today?

23
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.330
I am the girl who at 16 years old had my first international travel experience

24
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.070
and it's something that stuck with me.

25
00:01:43.071 --> 00:01:47.870
I went and was able to go to Australia and ever since then my wonder lost and my

26
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.250
idea of wanting to explore the world was deeply seated and rooted in me.

27
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.610
I spent 15 years in the fashion industry in New York City and my time there I

28
00:01:58.251 --> 00:02:01.220
would go in for my job interviews and we'd have this great interview.

29
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.360
We talk about what I was doing or about to do with this company and at the end

30
00:02:05.361 --> 00:02:08.660
the interview or I'd say,
Hey,
do you have any questions?
And I would say yes.

31
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.140
How much is this a work travel situation and how much vacation time do I get?

32
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.350
So you can imagine these interviewers were like,
wait a second,

33
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.000
you're your biggest concern about this job is how much time you get to spend out

34
00:02:23.001 --> 00:02:27.530
of the office.
Okay,
let's think about this a little bit.
So luckily enough,

35
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.380
throughout the career that I had in the fashion industry,

36
00:02:30.381 --> 00:02:33.500
I was able to travel a lot.
I would tremble domestically,

37
00:02:33.501 --> 00:02:34.760
I would travel internationally,

38
00:02:34.761 --> 00:02:37.700
I would travel for weeks on end with no break in between.

39
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.940
And there was one morning waking up in a hotel room in Italy and having no idea

40
00:02:43.161 --> 00:02:46.940
where I was.
So I'm sure that's happened to some of you in this room before.

41
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.630
You have no idea between the jet lag between where you were yesterday,

42
00:02:50.631 --> 00:02:54.350
where you're going tomorrow,
where are you?
And I said,
you know what?

43
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.200
I gotta do something here has got to give something's gotta change.

44
00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.480
I can't be stressed out.
I can't be out.
I can't be productive in this situation.

45
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.860
So what is it that I can do to change the way that I'm living while I travel?

46
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.400
So what I did was I started to just simply pool for from tools that I had used

47
00:03:11.711 --> 00:03:12.521
in my own life.

48
00:03:12.521 --> 00:03:17.110
So whether it was yoga practicing or meditation or eating healthy at home,

49
00:03:17.111 --> 00:03:20.980
I figured there's got a way be a way that I can implement this while I'm on the

50
00:03:20.981 --> 00:03:21.820
road as well.

51
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.010
So I started doing my own little tips and tricks and I would take that circuit

52
00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:27.311
again.

53
00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:30.220
I would see the same people that I was always traveling with and they would look

54
00:03:30.221 --> 00:03:34.390
at me and they would say,
you know what,
Linden?
You seem rested.
You seem happy,

55
00:03:34.391 --> 00:03:39.010
you seem healthy.
What has changed and how do I get that?

56
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.100
So I started to think to myself,
okay,
there must be something here.

57
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.350
Everybody is stressed out,
burnt out,

58
00:03:44.351 --> 00:03:48.070
living on the road when they travel for business and they need to get some

59
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.490
sanity back.
They need to get some semblance of themselves back.

60
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.990
And this led organically to the launch of [inaudible],

61
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.090
which is the wellness travel company I run.

62
00:03:58.091 --> 00:04:01.630
It was the first wellness travel company that was created here in the US.

63
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.310
And throughout that time,

64
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.220
the clients that I would take on the road for these health and wellness

65
00:04:06.221 --> 00:04:08.810
vacations and wanted more information,
uh,

66
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.220
how do I implement this when I get home?
Traveling with you is fantastic,

67
00:04:12.221 --> 00:04:16.480
but now I need to figure out how to put this into my own lifestyle,
which is,
uh,

68
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.820
how living well on the road came to be.

69
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.010
It's the book you guys are all getting a copy of today.
Uh,

70
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.830
that goes into health and wellness,
the science behind it.
Why these things work,

71
00:04:26.831 --> 00:04:30.400
which is what we're going to talk through a little bit today.

72
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.500
So one of the things I think we can all agree on is that travel is stressful.

73
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.850
There's no way around that.

74
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.480
And the first thing that we have to do is sort of recognize that and say to

75
00:04:40.481 --> 00:04:44.320
ourselves,
why,
why is trouble stressful?
Because as humans,

76
00:04:44.321 --> 00:04:47.650
we are hardwired to avoid negative experiences.

77
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.010
We've all had a bad travel experience,
we've missed a flight,

78
00:04:51.011 --> 00:04:52.180
we've run for a flight,

79
00:04:52.181 --> 00:04:56.050
we've had an altercation maybe with the gate agent who wouldn't get us on that

80
00:04:56.051 --> 00:04:57.490
flight.
Whatever it is,
right?

81
00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.630
So those are the experiences we internalize and they experiences that we

82
00:05:01.631 --> 00:05:02.464
remember.

83
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.730
And so we start to make our decisions from this fear based place of I don't want

84
00:05:06.731 --> 00:05:08.260
to do that.
I don't want to do that.

85
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.180
So let's talk a little bit about that fear base and how and what it is that it

86
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.250
that it does to us.
And then let's learn some tools with,

87
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.630
of how to deal with that and move on.
So we're,

88
00:05:19.631 --> 00:05:22.840
when we're talking about the stress of travel,
it,

89
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.890
the stress of travel affects our whole mind,
body connection,
the physical,

90
00:05:26.891 --> 00:05:30.820
the mental,
and the emotional.
When it comes to our physical selves.

91
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:32.710
You can picture yourself now,
right?

92
00:05:32.711 --> 00:05:35.770
You're running through the airport and you're trying to make that flight.

93
00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.560
You're the last person on the plane.
There's no room for your luggage.

94
00:05:38.561 --> 00:05:42.100
So you're trying to cram it in.
You're trying to cram yourself into the seat,

95
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.460
right?

96
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.180
All of these things are completely stressful and take our body out of whack.

97
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.050
We're disrupting her sleep patterns.
When we change time zones,
even,

98
00:05:50.051 --> 00:05:53.580
especially if we're doing it for a short period of time,
uh,

99
00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.830
we're increasing our sedentary behavior.
Uh,
you know,

100
00:05:56.831 --> 00:06:00.470
you guys here at Google are lucky enough to have these great outdoor spaces in

101
00:06:00.471 --> 00:06:03.290
these conference rooms so you can get up and move around a little bit.

102
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.110
That's not the typical workplace environment these days.

103
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.430
So people are taking themselves from sitting behind a desk to sitting on a plane

104
00:06:10.431 --> 00:06:12.170
for hours on end,
right?

105
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.890
This is stressing our physical system when it comes to our mental system.

106
00:06:15.891 --> 00:06:17.600
We're also taxing our brains.

107
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.770
We live in this day and age because we're so connected all the time.

108
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:25.460
And with everything that we do,
we live in a constant state of chronic stress.

109
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:26.510
On some level,

110
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:31.520
we have moved away from being in that nice relaxed place to being in that place

111
00:06:31.521 --> 00:06:34.130
where we're constantly in our fight or flight mode.

112
00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.340
So add on top of that business travel,
right?

113
00:06:37.341 --> 00:06:40.340
You have to make sure you're working very well,

114
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.150
but then you also have to make sure like,
oh,
how am I going to pack a,

115
00:06:44.151 --> 00:06:46.690
am I prepping for my meetings properly?
And then the,

116
00:06:46.691 --> 00:06:51.691
the anxiety and the worry on that to add it on top of that when it comes to all

117
00:06:52.041 --> 00:06:56.870
of these things.
So our brain starts to work overtime.
In our emotional state,

118
00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.990
we have anxiety around travel.
Um,

119
00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.620
there is a lot going on in the world today,
whether it's where we're traveling,

120
00:07:03.621 --> 00:07:07.570
whether it's going through the airport itself,
we start to get anxious.
Um,

121
00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:10.970
am I going to make that flight?
Have I prepped for that meeting really well?

122
00:07:10.971 --> 00:07:14.030
Am I going to have an issue when I land on the ground?
Uh,

123
00:07:14.031 --> 00:07:18.110
there's also a lot of mistrust these days in the travel industry.

124
00:07:18.111 --> 00:07:22.580
I'm sure we've all seen the viral videos that have come out and done the last

125
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.290
few weeks even specifically,
right?
So the clients,
uh,
and,

126
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.930
and everyone who is traveling has an inherent mistrust of these companies that

127
00:07:29.931 --> 00:07:34.790
we are in trusting our business travel to.
And then fear.
So back to this,

128
00:07:34.791 --> 00:07:38.870
making decisions from a place of fear.
Some people are afraid of flying.

129
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.450
So that itself,
you know,

130
00:07:41.451 --> 00:07:44.750
sets you up in a negative space before you've even taken off.

131
00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:48.410
So these are all things that we have to deal with when it comes to trouble.

132
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:52.160
So why do we do it?
Right?
Why do companies keep sending us out?

133
00:07:52.161 --> 00:07:56.060
What is the benefit of business travel?
Uh,

134
00:07:56.061 --> 00:07:58.700
and there there are many benefits to business travel.

135
00:07:58.701 --> 00:08:02.090
The biggest things here are it builds relationships and retention.

136
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:05.900
And that is not only from the client and employer side,

137
00:08:05.901 --> 00:08:08.600
but also from the employee to the employer side.

138
00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:13.190
So when you're able to get on the road and you meet your clients face to face,

139
00:08:13.191 --> 00:08:14.810
it builds these relationships.

140
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:19.580
It builds these relationships between you and your client and you bond with your

141
00:08:19.581 --> 00:08:22.190
client when you're in front of them.
Um,
and,

142
00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:26.630
and it endears you a bit to them.
You build this personal relationship.

143
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.860
Also on the other spectrum of that,
employees who like to travel or who,

144
00:08:30.861 --> 00:08:34.580
who travel a lot and have found ways through these tips that we're going to walk

145
00:08:34.581 --> 00:08:36.530
through to make,
uh,

146
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:40.160
make it a little bit of a leisure and enjoyable experience at the same time,

147
00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:44.420
you will stick with your company longer.
So that's great for the company as well.

148
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:48.530
It increases productivity when you have face to face meetings and you're able to

149
00:08:48.531 --> 00:08:53.210
sit in front of somebody and talk through problems,
talk through solutions,

150
00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:58.090
it increases the project.
I'm sure all of you.
Uh,

151
00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:02.370
maybe today,
maybe tomorrow we'll be on a conference call,
right?
So we thought,
oh,

152
00:09:02.371 --> 00:09:05.970
when conferencing gets big,
when video conferencing gets big,

153
00:09:05.971 --> 00:09:08.820
we're not going to need that face to face meeting anymore.

154
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.070
And actually that hasn't proved to be true.

155
00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:15.780
We are more productive when we have our PR person to person face to face

156
00:09:15.781 --> 00:09:19.440
meetings.
So when you're on a conference call,
I'm sure many of you have done it,

157
00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:23.730
the statistics are that 60% of people on a conference call are also doing

158
00:09:23.731 --> 00:09:25.650
something else at the same time.

159
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.320
So they're not really paying attention to what's going on.

160
00:09:28.321 --> 00:09:31.590
And some of that's because maybe you're on this big call with all these people

161
00:09:31.591 --> 00:09:34.590
and you're not needed at that moment.
So you're checking your email,

162
00:09:34.591 --> 00:09:37.800
you're figuring out what your dinner plans are going to be,
you know,

163
00:09:37.801 --> 00:09:41.070
whatever it is.
Um,
uh,
and,

164
00:09:41.071 --> 00:09:44.900
and other statistics that have come out around the conference call,
right?
Um,

165
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:47.160
and I will tell you right now,

166
00:09:47.161 --> 00:09:51.150
I've never been one of these people that over 50% have admitted that while on a

167
00:09:51.151 --> 00:09:52.770
conference call,
they've been in the bathroom.

168
00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:57.090
So I'm hoping that they were on mute,
right?
Nobody wants to hear that.

169
00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:01.240
But these are the things that when you have face to face meetings,
you,

170
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:06.090
they don't happen.
You don't get distracted.
Um,
getting up,
getting,

171
00:10:06.091 --> 00:10:09.000
moving,
getting out of your typical environment.
Um,

172
00:10:09.001 --> 00:10:12.570
whether it's a cubicle or an office promotes out of the box thinking and

173
00:10:12.571 --> 00:10:13.410
creativity.

174
00:10:13.411 --> 00:10:16.830
It puts you in real life situations where you're taught to think on your feet

175
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:21.090
and you're taught to be flexible.
So these are all things that companies in,

176
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.620
in terms of why they want you to business travel makes it productive and

177
00:10:25.621 --> 00:10:28.890
beneficial for them as well as for yourself.
Uh,

178
00:10:28.891 --> 00:10:32.220
the statistics around the spending for business travel are huge.

179
00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:37.250
The global business travel spend in 2015 was one point $2 trillion and it's

180
00:10:38.641 --> 00:10:42.990
rising every year.
It's also something that actually rises during a recession.

181
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:47.070
And because companies have found that back to these first three things that we

182
00:10:47.071 --> 00:10:49.860
talked about,
uh,
relationships in retention,

183
00:10:49.861 --> 00:10:54.510
productivity and creativity are things that keep clients around longer.

184
00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:59.220
So even in a downturn,
people are spending on business travel.
And why is this?

185
00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:03.240
Because of what is invested,
the return is very high.

186
00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:07.620
So every dollar that's invested that a company invests in sending you on the

187
00:11:07.621 --> 00:11:08.340
road,

188
00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:13.340
they see an increase in of $9 and 50 cents in their revenue and $2 and 90 cents

189
00:11:14.791 --> 00:11:18.060
in profit.
So that's why you're getting sent on the road all the time.

190
00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:23.060
So how has travel changing business travel has completely shifted,
uh,

191
00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:24.540
in the last 10 years,

192
00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.440
32% of millennials who are doing business travel.

193
00:11:28.441 --> 00:11:32.580
And have some control over their schedule themselves are booking directly on

194
00:11:32.581 --> 00:11:35.280
their phone.
They're researching and booking on their phone,

195
00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.530
which has created this great world,
uh,

196
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:42.590
for all the apps and all the ways that are becoming coming out now that support

197
00:11:42.631 --> 00:11:43.620
business travel,

198
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:48.810
non traditional booking platforms are becoming more acceptable in traditional

199
00:11:48.811 --> 00:11:53.260
companies.
So the shared economy of things like Airbnb,
lift,
Uber,

200
00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:57.280
they're,
they're um,
creating business divisions that are,

201
00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:00.970
that are partnering with corporations and allowing you to stay like this.

202
00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:04.930
What's really interesting in terms of accommodations and in terms of blurring

203
00:12:04.931 --> 00:12:07.370
this line between business and leisure,
uh,

204
00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:12.420
four 56% of people who book a on an Airbnb type platform for your accommodations

205
00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:17.680
on average book,
five night trips.

206
00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:21.670
Whereas when you're solely looking at hotels,
you're booking three night trips.

207
00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:26.560
So you can see when it comes to this idea of figuring out how business travel is

208
00:12:26.561 --> 00:12:27.610
working for you,

209
00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:31.870
this is something interesting that comes into play as far as that's concerned.

210
00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:34.420
Everything is ending up on social media.

211
00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:38.530
This is a huge change that's really exploded in the last two or three years.

212
00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.900
And you can find the stuff on any platform.

213
00:12:40.901 --> 00:12:42.940
It's not specific to one or the other.

214
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:47.710
So here's the thing about business travel and people posting about it on social

215
00:12:47.711 --> 00:12:52.330
media.
They post the good,
they post the bad,
which we all know,

216
00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:56.650
but companies are also interacting with their clients when it comes to social

217
00:12:56.651 --> 00:13:01.180
media and it's really become an acceptable way to get real time feedback.

218
00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:02.860
So I can give you an example.

219
00:13:02.861 --> 00:13:07.630
A few years ago my husband and I were in Colombia and I was there on business

220
00:13:07.631 --> 00:13:10.690
and we came at different times.
And so we had separate flights out.

221
00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:13.150
He was booked on a jet blue flight and,

222
00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:17.590
and there was only one flight a day and a three flights a week that we're

223
00:13:17.591 --> 00:13:18.700
departing,
uh,

224
00:13:18.701 --> 00:13:22.240
where we were in Columbia and he missed his flight for whatever reason,
right?

225
00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:23.920
So there was nothing he could do.

226
00:13:23.921 --> 00:13:26.440
He couldn't get on another flight with jet blue.

227
00:13:26.441 --> 00:13:28.240
He had to figure stuff out himself.

228
00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:32.590
But what he did immediately was he tweeted JetBlue about his problem and they

229
00:13:32.591 --> 00:13:37.591
responded right away apologizing and giving him a travel credit for everything

230
00:13:38.531 --> 00:13:39.370
that he went through.

231
00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:43.870
So this goes back to how is the industry changing both the way that we use it

232
00:13:43.871 --> 00:13:46.840
and the way that the companies are interacting with their clients.

233
00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:52.300
The biggest change in the last few years when it comes to business travel deals

234
00:13:52.301 --> 00:13:57.301
with perception and this perception is both how the employer views business

235
00:13:57.521 --> 00:13:59.680
travel and the employee as well.

236
00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:03.970
So businesses see people who are willing to travel for business as more valuable

237
00:14:03.971 --> 00:14:04.804
employees.

238
00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:09.730
And that goes back to that productivity creativity idea that we were talking

239
00:14:09.731 --> 00:14:13.660
about.
Um,
it sparks new ideas.
It sparks partnerships,

240
00:14:13.661 --> 00:14:17.680
it sparks more loyalty when you're working face to face with other people.

241
00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:22.570
And it's really interesting this day and age when it comes to travel.
Uh,

242
00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:27.520
30% of people who are interviewing for new jobs have said that they are willing

243
00:14:27.521 --> 00:14:32.260
to take a pay cut or a lateral move if it means they're able to travel for

244
00:14:32.261 --> 00:14:35.650
business more.
So think about that,
right?

245
00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:38.680
It is becoming more acceptable to be out of the office.

246
00:14:38.681 --> 00:14:41.830
It's becoming more acceptable to work in different ways.

247
00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:47.230
And employers are recognizing these benefits and figuring out how they can tie

248
00:14:47.231 --> 00:14:50.410
that back to their companies being more profitable.

249
00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:56.280
So
now that you know that it's time to travel,
right?

250
00:14:56.310 --> 00:15:00.390
We know what the benefits are for the companies and we know what the detriments

251
00:15:00.391 --> 00:15:01.620
are to ourselves.

252
00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:06.270
How do we change those detriments into positives for ourselves when we travel?

253
00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:09.870
How do we counteract those physical,
mental,

254
00:15:09.871 --> 00:15:14.871
and emotional tolls that are created and so that we can function option optimal,

255
00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.860
Molly,
when we're traveling.

256
00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:21.720
So what you need to do is you need to create some tools for yourself.

257
00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.750
So what I want you to do here today,

258
00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:28.120
little experiment to see how it works for you.
Uh,

259
00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:29.640
we're going to do a breathing exercise.

260
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:32.730
So I want you to take anything that's on your lap and shifted off.

261
00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:37.710
I want you to scoot forward in your chair so that you can feel your feet on the

262
00:15:37.711 --> 00:15:38.544
ground.

263
00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:40.970
<v 1>Okay?</v>

264
00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:42.740
<v 0>I want you to sit up straight.</v>

265
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.430
Rest your hands in your lap so you feel comfortable.

266
00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:47.730
<v 1>Okay.</v>

267
00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:51.270
<v 0>And then I want you to trust me and I want you to close your eyes.</v>

268
00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:59.610
So take a second here just to check in with yourself,

269
00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:04.800
to take a pause.
And I want you to breathe in.

270
00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:08.280
Take a deep breath in,
and I want you to release it out your mouth.

271
00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:11.190
So breathe in and release your breath.

272
00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:17.450
Breathe in through your nose and release it out through your mouth.

273
00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:24.270
So now that you're centered and you're feeling yourself in the room right now,

274
00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:30.200
I want you to repeat in your mind on your inbreath the words I am and on your

275
00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:33.150
outbreath here.

276
00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:34.380
<v 1>Okay.</v>

277
00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:36.060
<v 0>So breathe in.
I am.</v>

278
00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.170
<v 1>Okay.</v>

279
00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:39.940
<v 0>Breathe out here.</v>

280
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:45.140
Breathe in.
I am

281
00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:48.700
breathe out here.

282
00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:52.900
So do it a few more times on your own

283
00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:04.750
and now open your eyes.

284
00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:12.400
So hopefully that few seconds of breathing that I just taught you is the first

285
00:17:12.771 --> 00:17:16.580
tool that you can sort of put in your business travel toolbox.

286
00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:17.810
So what just happened?

287
00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:23.240
We removed some of your external stimulation by closing your eyes.

288
00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:25.640
And by being in this room where it's quiet,

289
00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:30.700
we took away the visual and the audio sensory loads that we all have these days

290
00:17:31.281 --> 00:17:33.650
where we're technically overloaded on all that.

291
00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:39.570
Being able to take away outside input and outside sense sensory,
uh,

292
00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:41.930
it allows us to shift our subconscious thinking.

293
00:17:41.931 --> 00:17:46.040
It brings us into the here and now by focusing your mind on your breath,

294
00:17:46.041 --> 00:17:49.160
by focusing your mind on that I am here statement,

295
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:51.450
you're bringing yourself into the present moment.

296
00:17:51.451 --> 00:17:53.340
You're not thinking about something that just happened.

297
00:17:53.341 --> 00:17:56.220
You're not thinking about what's coming up this afternoon.
You're,

298
00:17:56.221 --> 00:18:01.221
you're making yourself present and all of this helps trigger a relaxation

299
00:18:01.651 --> 00:18:05.400
response.
So the idea by removing the sensory input by,

300
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:10.110
by going inside,
even if it's just for a breath or two and focusing on yourself,

301
00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.960
you're,
you're restricting the flow of cortisol,

302
00:18:12.961 --> 00:18:16.470
which is our stress hormone and it's constantly producing.

303
00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:21.030
So if we can find a way to reshift not only our thinking,

304
00:18:21.031 --> 00:18:25.050
but Reese reshaped the way the chemistry is in our brain and we're,

305
00:18:25.051 --> 00:18:27.330
we're taking ourselves out of that survival mode,

306
00:18:27.331 --> 00:18:31.590
out of that fight or flight mode.
And into the present,
we can learn to relax.

307
00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:36.120
So some people may have felt anxiety or discomfort while we did that,

308
00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:39.520
which is totally fine.
This is how I felt the first way I,

309
00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:43.680
the first time I did it to my couldn't focus.
My mind was everywhere.

310
00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:46.500
This was something that was totally new and different to me and I was like,

311
00:18:46.501 --> 00:18:48.690
how am I supposed to relax when I'm doing this?
Right?

312
00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:52.350
It takes practice and that's,
that is just,

313
00:18:52.351 --> 00:18:55.410
you have to put something into it to get something great out of it.

314
00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:59.850
And the reason this is is because what we just did affects the prefrontal cortex

315
00:18:59.851 --> 00:19:00.684
of our brain.

316
00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:04.980
We have all these neuro transmitters in there and they start firing on high

317
00:19:04.981 --> 00:19:09.420
speed when we're doing something new and different and uncomfortable and

318
00:19:09.421 --> 00:19:13.740
immediately our brains has to us warning danger.
Don't do that.
Don't go there.

319
00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.920
So it takes some time for us to retrain ourselves.

320
00:19:16.921 --> 00:19:21.660
It takes some time for us to stabilize these neurotransmitters in our brain and

321
00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:25.350
create these new pathways that will lead us to relaxation.

322
00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.510
So what's great about that exercise,

323
00:19:27.511 --> 00:19:30.900
that first tool that you now have in your toolbox,
you can do it anywhere.

324
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:33.600
You can do it.
When you're stuck in traffic,
you can do it.

325
00:19:33.601 --> 00:19:35.820
When you're in an Uber on the way to the airport,

326
00:19:35.821 --> 00:19:39.810
you can do it when you're sitting at the airport and your flight was delayed and

327
00:19:39.811 --> 00:19:42.900
there's nothing you can do about it.
You can do it when you get on the airplane,

328
00:19:42.901 --> 00:19:46.320
right?
So this is the first thing that you can do to set yourself up,

329
00:19:46.321 --> 00:19:49.560
to have a positive experience,
to set yourself up,

330
00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:53.820
to change the narrative and change the story that you tell yourself that

331
00:19:53.821 --> 00:19:57.330
business travel is stressful.
So let's flip it around.
Let's,

332
00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:02.010
let's reorder the way that our brain is firing and let's say to ourselves,

333
00:20:02.011 --> 00:20:04.800
we can start this from are relaxed and positive place.

334
00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:07.260
So let's get to some practicalities here.

335
00:20:07.261 --> 00:20:10.200
What are you packing when it comes time for your business trip?

336
00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:13.290
I have some props in the back of the room that you can take a look at on your

337
00:20:13.291 --> 00:20:16.670
way out.
Um,
I prepack I have an,
uh,

338
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:18.990
a section of stuff in my house,

339
00:20:18.991 --> 00:20:23.000
in a drawer in my closet that has all the things that I know throughout

340
00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.950
developing my travel routine that are prepacked and I,

341
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:29.370
it's one less thing I have to stress and worry about when it comes time to get

342
00:20:29.371 --> 00:20:31.530
ready for a business trip.
For me,

343
00:20:31.531 --> 00:20:35.250
I focus on five areas that are going to affect my health and wellness when I

344
00:20:35.251 --> 00:20:39.030
travel,
how I sleep,
how I eat,
how I move,

345
00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:41.550
how to stay healthy,
and how am I going to work.

346
00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:45.480
And so there's easy things that don't take up a lot of room that you can keep

347
00:20:45.481 --> 00:20:47.830
prepacked even in your suitcase if you want.

348
00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:50.530
So then you don't even have to remember what drawer you put it in,
right?

349
00:20:50.531 --> 00:20:54.250
We want to take all these choices in all these decisions away and make it easy

350
00:20:54.251 --> 00:20:56.290
for ourselves.
We want to set ourselves up.

351
00:20:56.410 --> 00:21:00.610
We want to take out that stress and make it to make it into success.

352
00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:05.230
So traveling with things like earplugs or I'm asks for the plane,
I'm Aipac,

353
00:21:05.231 --> 00:21:07.930
nutrient rich snacks.
Um,
I have,

354
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:11.890
whether it's Allman butter or something like this that is going to keep me

355
00:21:11.891 --> 00:21:15.550
healthy and happy.
And that way if I get somewhere we were,

356
00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:19.510
we were just talking before I came up on stage about how you land somewhere and

357
00:21:19.511 --> 00:21:23.440
it's too late to have dinner and you end up reaching for crop while when you

358
00:21:23.441 --> 00:21:26.680
have stuff packed with you that you know is healthy and good for you,

359
00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:29.200
then great there,
there is no decision there.

360
00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:32.290
You've cut all of that out when it comes to movement.

361
00:21:32.291 --> 00:21:36.130
If you can pack workout clothes,
if that's too much for you,
take a jump rope,

362
00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:38.820
take one of those therabands that you've seen.
Uh,

363
00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:43.180
you can use props that don't take up a lot of room to keep yourself moving.

364
00:21:43.181 --> 00:21:44.920
And even if it's for 10 minutes,
right,

365
00:21:44.921 --> 00:21:47.410
you can move on to get up and move on the plane,
uh,

366
00:21:47.411 --> 00:21:51.620
or you can use these props when you get to your hotel room.
Uh,

367
00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:55.390
staying healthy is a big one.
Uh,
when we're changing all these environments,

368
00:21:55.391 --> 00:21:58.060
we're meeting all these new people were shaking hands,
things like that.

369
00:21:58.061 --> 00:22:01.840
Aside from washing your hands,
what can you do to stay healthy when you travel?

370
00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:06.820
Um,
drink a lot of water,
more,
more water than you would normally drink.

371
00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:09.070
I would say reach for that as the first thing.

372
00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:13.220
Things like coffee and alcohol dehydrate you.
So if you're going to,
um,

373
00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.010
be heavy on the coffee and the alcohol,

374
00:22:15.011 --> 00:22:19.450
think about that and purposely drink more water to counteract those effects as

375
00:22:19.451 --> 00:22:22.740
well.
Um,
I travel with these amazing,
uh,

376
00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:26.050
wipes that are these essential oil wipes.
They smell like lavender,

377
00:22:26.051 --> 00:22:30.240
which is great because they smell good and lavender is relaxing.
Uh,

378
00:22:30.241 --> 00:22:33.040
and it's also an anti,
it has antibacterial properties.

379
00:22:33.041 --> 00:22:35.410
So the first thing I do when I get onto a plane,

380
00:22:35.411 --> 00:22:39.040
or the first thing I do when I get into a hotel room is I break open those wipes

381
00:22:39.041 --> 00:22:40.920
and I wiped everything down,
um,

382
00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:45.100
to make sure that I am cleaning it for whatever was there before me.
Right?
I,

383
00:22:45.101 --> 00:22:49.870
there is a woman that I fell on the plane,
uh,
coming here out to La Actually,

384
00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:52.750
uh,
who had this awesome,
I hadn't seen it before.

385
00:22:52.751 --> 00:22:57.070
It was sort of like a fitted bed sheet that was made for her plane seat.

386
00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:00.460
So she pulled that whole thing out and just covered it,
covered it up.

387
00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:03.730
So there's things that are coming out into the marketplace that make it easy for

388
00:23:03.731 --> 00:23:08.560
you.
So you keep these things packed when it comes to work.
Um,
chargers,

389
00:23:08.561 --> 00:23:10.990
adapters,
USB cords,
business cards.

390
00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:14.050
These are things that we probably have two or three of.
Right.
So,

391
00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:16.900
so take a pile of that and put it in in your suitcase,

392
00:23:16.901 --> 00:23:21.100
put it in your pre travel pack and you take out that stress as far as that's

393
00:23:21.101 --> 00:23:25.060
concerned.
What about your pre travel routine?

394
00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:28.270
So this is something that's going to take you a little while to cultivate and

395
00:23:28.271 --> 00:23:33.271
develop because it is going to be specific to what you like and how you live.

396
00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:37.270
Um,
it,
it took me a long time to cultivate my routine.

397
00:23:37.271 --> 00:23:42.010
It's a 24 hour routine of self care.
Uh,
and I extended,

398
00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:45.980
I extended to 48 hours if I'm going away for a long time or if I'm going really

399
00:23:45.981 --> 00:23:50.940
far.
Um,
and for me,
this is what has set me up for success.
This by,

400
00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:52.730
by sticking to this routine,

401
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:57.680
if you ha you land and you have meetings or if you land and you will immediately

402
00:23:57.681 --> 00:24:01.010
have to go to be a business dinner,
our conference or whatever it is,

403
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:05.030
you already know that you're starting off from a place of health and wellness.

404
00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:08.780
So what this means for me,
oftentimes I'll take red eye flights.
Uh,

405
00:24:08.781 --> 00:24:13.781
so my 24 hour self care routine starts by the way that I sleep the night before

406
00:24:14.361 --> 00:24:15.710
I leave.
So for me,

407
00:24:15.711 --> 00:24:19.580
that seven to eight hours of quality sleep and the first thing that I do when I

408
00:24:19.581 --> 00:24:20.600
wake up the next morning,

409
00:24:20.601 --> 00:24:24.560
his workout and that workout can be anything that is good for you.

410
00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:26.250
Anything that you like to do.
Um,

411
00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:29.120
I try all these different crazy workout routines,
uh,

412
00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:32.840
to experiment and see what I like.
Uh,
this is one of my favorites.

413
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:37.370
Doing some aerial work here.
Uh,
hanging upside down gets all of your,

414
00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:40.040
your lymphatic system moving,
your Oregon's moving.

415
00:24:40.041 --> 00:24:42.950
So it doesn't have to be a traditional workout routine.
Get,

416
00:24:42.951 --> 00:24:44.990
get yourself moving because you know,

417
00:24:44.991 --> 00:24:48.620
you're setting yourself up to be on a plane for a little while.
Uh,

418
00:24:48.621 --> 00:24:51.690
you can move through this whole routine,
uh,

419
00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:55.190
and use this as a guideline for yourself.
I drink my veggies,

420
00:24:55.191 --> 00:24:58.880
I want to make sure I'm getting all the vitamins and minerals and nutrients that

421
00:24:58.881 --> 00:25:02.390
I need and I'm not sure where we're at,
what I'm going to eat when I land.

422
00:25:02.391 --> 00:25:05.000
So I sort of pregame it that way,
right?

423
00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:08.510
Making sure I get all the things that I need.
I moved throughout the day,

424
00:25:08.511 --> 00:25:12.240
so I'll have walking meetings.
If I'm meeting people somewhere,
um,

425
00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:16.280
I will get up and I will walk and get lunch instead of eating it at my desk,

426
00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.320
I will consume extra water.

427
00:25:18.321 --> 00:25:22.520
I always have a portable water bottle with me wherever I go.
Ah,

428
00:25:22.521 --> 00:25:25.550
you can fill it up in the airport as well before you even get on the plane,

429
00:25:25.551 --> 00:25:29.810
which is great.
I have what I call a nutrient rich last meal,

430
00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:31.730
so I don't eat on the plane.

431
00:25:31.731 --> 00:25:34.220
I fast on the plane and I'm going to talk about that in a second.

432
00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:36.920
So in order to set myself up to do that,

433
00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:41.720
I need to make sure that that lasts two meal that I'm eating before I fly for 16

434
00:25:41.721 --> 00:25:43.730
hours,
let's say to Asia,
uh,

435
00:25:43.731 --> 00:25:48.440
is something like salmon and Keenwah or Pharaoh,
uh,
at,
with spinach.

436
00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:50.750
So I want to make sure I'm getting these healthy fats.

437
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:54.560
I want to make sure that I'm getting something with protein.
Again,

438
00:25:54.561 --> 00:25:58.960
something that's nutrient rich that will keep me full and keep me healthy,
uh,

439
00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:03.800
before I get on the plane.
So I'm not tempted to reach for um,
uh,

440
00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:07.460
you know,
m and m's or something like this.
Um,
I pack snacks,

441
00:26:07.461 --> 00:26:08.450
which we talked about,

442
00:26:08.451 --> 00:26:11.750
which are great for if you get hungry on the plane or when you land,

443
00:26:11.751 --> 00:26:14.960
if it's something that you need.
And then I also plan my plane time.

444
00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:19.200
A lot of people you'll,
you'll say like,
oh,
I hate flying because it's the,

445
00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:22.820
this dead time for me.
Right.
Flip that story in your mind,

446
00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:26.570
what can you do with those hours of travel?
For me,

447
00:26:26.571 --> 00:26:31.280
I love to not be online.
I know you can pay for Wifi these days,
but I'm like,

448
00:26:31.281 --> 00:26:34.760
forget it.
I'm connected all the rest of my life.

449
00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:37.790
The time on the plane is for me to do things my way.

450
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.630
So whether that for me is writing in my journal,
whether it's watching a movie,

451
00:26:41.631 --> 00:26:44.670
I've been wanting to see whether it's trying to get some extra sleep,

452
00:26:44.671 --> 00:26:48.930
whatever it is,
it could be work,
that's fine,
but plan,

453
00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:52.950
play in your time so you can use it effectively and again about,

454
00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:55.560
it's all about setting yourself up for success.

455
00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:58.230
So how are you healthy on the go?

456
00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:02.130
We've talked about what you need to have packed in waiting.

457
00:27:02.131 --> 00:27:05.790
We talked about your pre travel routine that you need to set up for yourself.

458
00:27:05.791 --> 00:27:08.070
That's gonna work for you.
So now that you're ready,

459
00:27:08.071 --> 00:27:11.190
now that you're in the air and on your way,
how do you stay healthy?

460
00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:12.660
So technology,

461
00:27:12.661 --> 00:27:16.230
you gotta love it because people are coming up with all these amazing ways to

462
00:27:16.231 --> 00:27:18.810
stay happy and healthy when you travel.
Uh,

463
00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:22.960
these are three categories that I look at a lot when it comes to the,

464
00:27:22.961 --> 00:27:26.370
the technology that I have on my phone's in my tablets.
So food,

465
00:27:26.371 --> 00:27:31.350
hotel in wellness are big areas.
Um,
there are some great food apps out there,

466
00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:35.370
a one called grab.
So if you do a lot of domestic travel,

467
00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:37.650
download this to your phone.

468
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:42.830
And what it is is it gives you in major cities around the world that their

469
00:27:43.171 --> 00:27:47.100
airport menu layout for all of the restaurants that are in the airport.

470
00:27:47.101 --> 00:27:50.430
So you can search through,
you already know what's going to be in the terminal,

471
00:27:50.431 --> 00:27:55.350
you already know where it is,
bonus,
you can preorder your food.

472
00:27:56.160 --> 00:28:00.750
So this way there's no waiting in line,
there's no wasting time figuring it out.

473
00:28:00.751 --> 00:28:03.780
Where,
where you want to eat,
what you want to eat.
Is it healthy?

474
00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:05.910
So it's a great app that does it for you.

475
00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:10.170
I'm happy cow if you've ever heard of it as a Vegan Vegetarian App,
uh,

476
00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:13.830
that's actually worldwide and,
and recommends restaurants around the world.

477
00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:17.310
Hotel apps day use is one of my favorites.
So there's this,

478
00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:22.500
this trend that started a few years ago were hotel re hotels realize,
look,

479
00:28:22.501 --> 00:28:26.550
we have these empty rooms,
right?
Uh,
even if we're 90% occupancy,

480
00:28:26.551 --> 00:28:28.260
which is a great number for a hotel,

481
00:28:28.261 --> 00:28:32.140
there are still a number of rooms at each hotel every day that go unused,

482
00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:35.370
they have decided to target to the business traveler.

483
00:28:35.371 --> 00:28:39.840
So this day use app lets you rent a hotel room for a few hours,

484
00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:42.990
which is awesome because what can happen is,

485
00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:46.140
let's say you're in town for a day and you arrive early,

486
00:28:46.141 --> 00:28:47.850
but you don't have a meeting to late at night.

487
00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:51.160
You can pay for a fan to hook a great hotel,
uh,

488
00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:56.040
for a few hours using this app and you can shower,
you can have a nap.

489
00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:59.970
What's even better,
you get access to the amenities of the hotel.

490
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.930
So the first thing I do is head to the steam room or the sauna,
right?

491
00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:08.820
That is a treat.
And that is something that is gonna gonna reset and refresh you,

492
00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:10.800
especially after being on an airplane.

493
00:29:10.801 --> 00:29:14.010
And it's a good use of your time where you're not necessarily sitting in an

494
00:29:14.011 --> 00:29:18.710
airport lounge.
So check that out.
That's a great piece of travel technology.
Um,

495
00:29:18.711 --> 00:29:22.060
and of course there's well new wellness apps that come out every day.
Headspace,

496
00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.940
if you've heard of it,
it's a meditation APP.

497
00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:26.820
Headspace is actually partnered with some airlines out there,

498
00:29:26.821 --> 00:29:31.140
so you can have this access to this app in plain as well on the screen in front

499
00:29:31.141 --> 00:29:31.800
of you.

500
00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:35.700
And train is a great sleep cycle app that was developed with the University of

501
00:29:35.701 --> 00:29:40.260
Michigan and it helps you sort of retrain yourself when you're trying to get

502
00:29:40.261 --> 00:29:44.020
over jet lag.
And so on the plane,
this is the big thing.

503
00:29:44.021 --> 00:29:46.570
So you have all these apps,
you have these ways to set you up,

504
00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:49.300
you're ready when you land,
but on the plane itself,

505
00:29:49.301 --> 00:29:52.300
especially when you're on the plane for this long time,
um,

506
00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:55.630
how do you optimize your health and wellness?
The first thing is really easy.

507
00:29:55.631 --> 00:30:00.140
You just want to smile at everybody when you're going through the airport.
Um,

508
00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:04.870
we talked about how detrimental travel can be and most of travelers out there

509
00:30:04.871 --> 00:30:07.300
are operating from that space,
right?
So it takes,

510
00:30:07.301 --> 00:30:09.610
it's simple smile to make somebody's Day.

511
00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:14.230
It also endears you to the staff of that airplane,

512
00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:18.070
right?
You're angling for that upgrade.
You're angling for,
you know,

513
00:30:18.071 --> 00:30:22.670
whatever it is,
that extra blanket,
um,
smile at everybody there.

514
00:30:22.671 --> 00:30:27.310
There's no harm in it.
It only sets you up,
uh,
to,
to be in a happy place.

515
00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:29.440
Uh,
we talked about wiping it down,

516
00:30:29.441 --> 00:30:33.430
the wipes or the seat cover that will keep you healthy.

517
00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:38.500
This is the big one.
Skipping the food and beverage that's offered on the plane.

518
00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:41.590
Um,
and I know some people like,
okay,

519
00:30:41.591 --> 00:30:45.010
the food and business class and first class is the best.
Why would I skip that?

520
00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:49.870
I have to tell you that both Gordon Ramsay and Anthony Bordain have swear that

521
00:30:49.871 --> 00:30:52.210
they will never,
ever,
ever eat airplane food.

522
00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:56.230
So that should tell you something and they understand the food process,

523
00:30:56.231 --> 00:30:57.520
number one.
Uh,

524
00:30:57.521 --> 00:31:01.870
so they know what that whole backend looks like and they won't touch it.
Um,

525
00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:02.561
in general,

526
00:31:02.561 --> 00:31:07.060
what happens scientifically when we travel the airplane pressure in the cabin

527
00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:11.740
plays with our taste buds and with our texture.
And so to counteract that,

528
00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:14.890
the airlines have had to develop food products that tastes good.

529
00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:17.950
So how do they do that?
They pick high calorie,
high fat,

530
00:31:17.951 --> 00:31:22.430
high sugar items that will counteract the,

531
00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:26.830
the,
um,
dampening of our,
of our tastes and our texture.

532
00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:31.420
So the bottom line is whatever kind of food that they're feeding you,
it,

533
00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:32.800
it's not healthy.

534
00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:36.550
So it's healthier to not eat or it's healthier to bring your own snacks on the

535
00:31:36.551 --> 00:31:38.680
plane.
Uh,
when it comes to beverages,

536
00:31:38.681 --> 00:31:41.740
we talked about alcohol and coffee and how they dehydrate you.

537
00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:46.390
You're atmosphere in that plane,
in that air cabin pressure dehydrates you.

538
00:31:46.391 --> 00:31:47.950
So you're just adding to the mix.

539
00:31:47.951 --> 00:31:51.640
You're compounding that dehydration when you drink alcohol and coffee on the

540
00:31:51.641 --> 00:31:52.560
plane.
Um,

541
00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:56.320
the other thing that I should warn you about is they don't wash those coffee

542
00:31:56.321 --> 00:31:57.550
pots very often.

543
00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:01.640
So think about that the next time that you want to have coffee on the plane and

544
00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:05.140
maybe that will deter you and you'd rather wait til you land and you pick it up

545
00:32:05.141 --> 00:32:08.740
with your grab app instead.
So it's waiting there for you.
Um,

546
00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:13.660
and then returned to that breath exercise.
We just did return to that.
I am here.

547
00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:18.160
You can,
you can,
uh,
just breathe if you want.
Uh,
but use this as a time to,

548
00:32:18.161 --> 00:32:22.630
to kind of tune out everything around,
around you and tune into yourself.

549
00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:27.370
The number one travel hack that I can recommend if you don't have it already as

550
00:32:27.371 --> 00:32:31.780
global entry.
Um,
have you as everybody here have global entry?

551
00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:35.860
Yes.
No.
Yeah.
No.
Okay.
You want to get it?
It's $100.

552
00:32:35.861 --> 00:32:38.210
The best hundred dollars I've ever spent.
Um,

553
00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:42.350
and what it does is it gives you TSA precheck so you don't have to wait in line

554
00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:44.270
when you get to the airport.
You don't have to take your shoes off,

555
00:32:44.271 --> 00:32:48.890
you don't have to take your laptop out.
You get through the line really quickly.

556
00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:53.540
And now on the backend from international travel,
when you come home,
you,

557
00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:58.310
I have timed my entry into the country from the moment I step off the plane to

558
00:32:58.311 --> 00:33:03.200
the moment that I am at the curb outside has,
is eight minutes on average.

559
00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:07.340
Granted,
I only take a carry on,
right?
But eight minutes,
right?

560
00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:10.130
I have just skipped a whole lot of stress.

561
00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:13.010
So whether I'm coming back from business and I want to go home and get some

562
00:33:13.011 --> 00:33:16.440
sleep or whether I'm coming back from vacation,
you hold on to that,

563
00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:18.680
that more zen vibe,
right?

564
00:33:18.681 --> 00:33:22.460
When you're not immediately assaulted with these things.
So global entry,

565
00:33:22.461 --> 00:33:25.100
highly recommend it if you,
if you don't have it already.

566
00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:27.800
So all of these things that we've been talking about,

567
00:33:27.801 --> 00:33:32.210
all of these tools are we're using to increase our success.

568
00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:35.330
We're taking those detriments we talked about in the beginning,
those,

569
00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:39.200
those lugging around,
um,
suitcases,
those worrying about your flight,

570
00:33:39.201 --> 00:33:42.290
worrying about what you packed,
worrying if jet lag is going to affect you.

571
00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:44.480
And we're finding new ways to,

572
00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:48.070
to allow ourselves to optimally function,
um,

573
00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:53.000
to enjoy this travel experience a little bit more by putting a little effort

574
00:33:53.001 --> 00:33:56.930
into it at the time.
You'll find more tips on this in the book.
Um,

575
00:33:57.110 --> 00:34:00.890
but you have to really dive into and find out for yourself sort of what the

576
00:34:00.891 --> 00:34:04.940
pressure points are and what makes you not enjoy travel or what makes it hard to

577
00:34:04.941 --> 00:34:07.100
travel and change that narrative.

578
00:34:07.101 --> 00:34:10.460
Change the way that you think about those things that you do for yourself.

579
00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:14.660
So now you're ready to rock your trip,
right?
And you're all set up.

580
00:34:14.661 --> 00:34:16.250
You have a great pre travel routine,

581
00:34:16.251 --> 00:34:18.200
you figured out how to stay healthy on the plane.

582
00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:21.950
So how do you make the most of your trip?
Because you know when you leave,

583
00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:26.240
some of your time is going to be spent on work.
Some of it will be personal time,

584
00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:27.920
especially again,

585
00:34:27.921 --> 00:34:31.910
we're extending our stays to add personal time into our vacations in some way.

586
00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:35.270
So how do you take advantage of all your surroundings when you're doing this?

587
00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:36.560
When it comes to work?

588
00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:39.950
These are the three main things that eat up our time when we're business

589
00:34:39.951 --> 00:34:42.110
traveling.
We're in these face to face meetings,

590
00:34:42.111 --> 00:34:45.130
which we talked about because of that retention.
Um,

591
00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:49.340
and creativity that it sparks.
We're dealing with our email and we're in events.

592
00:34:49.341 --> 00:34:52.670
So whether that's conferences,
whether that's team dinners,
whatever it is.

593
00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:56.570
So how do we change how we approach these meetings so that it works for

594
00:34:56.571 --> 00:35:01.310
everybody.
One idea is just to get out of the office setting if you can.

595
00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:03.380
So I don't know if you've heard of this,

596
00:35:03.381 --> 00:35:07.190
but there's this phenomenon that's been sweeping some companies,
um,

597
00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:11.180
called sweat sessions.
Has anyone ever had a sweat session with their client?

598
00:35:11.181 --> 00:35:12.170
And you even know what that is?

599
00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:15.830
It's taking your meeting out of the office and taking it into a healthy

600
00:35:15.831 --> 00:35:18.650
environment.
So meet your client.
Are you are,
you know,

601
00:35:18.651 --> 00:35:21.200
have you had this relationship with your client for a while?
You know,

602
00:35:21.201 --> 00:35:25.550
they love PyLadies,
you know,
they love spin class.
You know,
they love to,
uh,

603
00:35:25.551 --> 00:35:29.210
you know,
they have a favorite healthy breakfast spot.
Change your meeting there,

604
00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:32.310
change your meeting to a different environment and you'll have,

605
00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:35.840
you'll notice how again,
it will bond you to your client a little more.

606
00:35:35.841 --> 00:35:39.810
You have more to talk about,
um,
outside of the office.
Uh,

607
00:35:39.811 --> 00:35:44.130
and it sparks that creative thinking as well when it comes to email,

608
00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:48.450
if you have the opportunity where you are when you travel more of a digital

609
00:35:48.451 --> 00:35:49.230
nomad,

610
00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:54.110
set yourself up for the opportunity to focus on email at segmented times.

611
00:35:54.111 --> 00:35:57.120
So you know what I can do,
especially here in La,
right?

612
00:35:57.121 --> 00:35:59.670
We don't have the beach in New York.
That's where I want to be.

613
00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:03.390
So I will set aside an hour,
let's say in the morning or in the afternoon,

614
00:36:03.391 --> 00:36:05.380
I will go to the beach.
I will,
I will,
um,

615
00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:09.120
take whatever device I need and that will be my email time and I can get

616
00:36:09.121 --> 00:36:12.600
everything banged out in that hour in an awesome environment.

617
00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:15.510
I see something more than the four walls of my hotel room,

618
00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:17.730
which can really be a drag.
And it,

619
00:36:17.731 --> 00:36:21.600
it grounds me to the space of where I am and it changes.
It makes me happier.

620
00:36:21.601 --> 00:36:23.790
It makes me happier to get out of the indoors.

621
00:36:23.791 --> 00:36:26.700
We spend 80% of our time inside.

622
00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:31.680
So if we can do a few things to shift that and get us outdoors more or get us

623
00:36:31.681 --> 00:36:32.970
into a different environment,

624
00:36:32.971 --> 00:36:37.440
more than go for it when it comes to events and entertaining.
Um,

625
00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:41.150
see if there's a way that you can sort of control some of this.
Um,

626
00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:46.140
I can tell you that in the last few years of my job in the fashion industry,

627
00:36:46.141 --> 00:36:50.820
I would probably spend five times a year in Vegas.
And when we were there,

628
00:36:50.821 --> 00:36:53.760
the,
we were required to entertain clients every night.

629
00:36:53.761 --> 00:36:57.600
So we'd have this full day of working full day of standing up on my feet.

630
00:36:57.601 --> 00:37:00.660
And then I was expected to entertain that night,
which is totally fine.

631
00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:04.800
But what I said to my boss at one point is like,
look,
if I'm required to do this,

632
00:37:04.801 --> 00:37:08.790
then I want a planet.
I want to be in charge of how this goes down.
Right?

633
00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:12.810
So luckily there's great options in Vegas and in most places in the world,

634
00:37:12.811 --> 00:37:14.400
if you do a little bit of research,

635
00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:18.270
I was able to find restaurants that had healthier foods.

636
00:37:18.271 --> 00:37:22.470
I was able to find restaurants that really cared about their ingredient and it

637
00:37:22.471 --> 00:37:26.250
offered me something as well as offered the client something so you can have

638
00:37:26.251 --> 00:37:28.920
that control over it.
If you're in a conference,

639
00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:31.290
talk to the conference planner and say,
you know what?

640
00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:33.630
I know you usually serve lunch meats,

641
00:37:33.631 --> 00:37:36.090
but maybe we can get something different this time.

642
00:37:36.091 --> 00:37:38.560
Maybe we can get something healthy this time.
Um,

643
00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:41.610
you are very lucky that the company that you work at right now,
uh,

644
00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:44.970
has been a leader in this and really cares about the employees and the,

645
00:37:44.971 --> 00:37:45.804
and their health.

646
00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:48.540
And so they go out of their way to provide some of these options.

647
00:37:48.541 --> 00:37:50.070
But that's not always the case.

648
00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:55.890
So we're working and we're on when we're business traveling,

649
00:37:55.891 --> 00:37:58.290
but we also have personal time.
We also have downtime.

650
00:37:58.291 --> 00:38:01.110
So that's something that is really important for you to remember.

651
00:38:01.111 --> 00:38:02.640
Just because you're on a business trip.

652
00:38:02.641 --> 00:38:07.641
Does it mean that company Ozu 24 seven you have to find a way to just like you

653
00:38:07.831 --> 00:38:11.310
would at home disconnect and do something for yourself every day.

654
00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:13.230
So it's up to you figure out why,

655
00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:17.670
where you can control your areas of your business trip.
Is it your schedule?

656
00:38:17.671 --> 00:38:21.720
Are you able to push meetings later in the day?
Is that when you work best?

657
00:38:21.721 --> 00:38:26.670
Is that give you time to use one of these hotel rooms for a few hours in
refresh?

658
00:38:26.671 --> 00:38:31.050
Are you able to control your food or your fitness or your sleep or how you

659
00:38:31.051 --> 00:38:35.950
recover or are you able to plan on both ends to extend your trip so you make it

660
00:38:35.951 --> 00:38:40.510
more interesting for yourself?
You make it more of a discovery option

661
00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:45.190
and then your environment,
right?

662
00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:49.990
We talked about seeing the four walls of your hotel room have to tell you,

663
00:38:49.991 --> 00:38:51.220
I have a pretty good job.

664
00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:54.280
This is what my environment tends to look like when I travel.

665
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:59.470
Anyone wants to join me?
I would love it.
But,
but because of this,

666
00:38:59.471 --> 00:39:03.490
I am able to choose how I set myself up when it comes to working,
right?

667
00:39:03.491 --> 00:39:04.450
So that first picture,

668
00:39:04.451 --> 00:39:09.400
whether it's outside of a pool in Bali where I'm overlooking the ocean,
I can,

669
00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:11.950
I can sit there for the afternoon and do my email.

670
00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:16.750
I can book a room that has my own private pool like this place in India,

671
00:39:17.010 --> 00:39:20.500
uh,
where I am able to,
again,
at the end of every day,

672
00:39:20.501 --> 00:39:23.200
I take five minutes to be in nature,

673
00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:27.820
to be by myself in nature or in this other option here.

674
00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:33.010
Um,
it doing yoga first thing every morning when I was in Vietnam.

675
00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:35.500
It's a good way for me to start my day.

676
00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:39.070
And there's hotels out there that are offering all of these options.

677
00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:42.640
Same with healthy food,
right?
There are so many choices these days.

678
00:39:42.641 --> 00:39:46.120
If you know where to look,
it does take a little bit of research.
Um,

679
00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:48.040
but once you find the places that you like,

680
00:39:48.041 --> 00:39:50.770
especially if these are areas that you travel all the time,

681
00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:55.290
these are great resources for you to just have.
Um,
you know,
you found,

682
00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:56.860
I started this,
uh,

683
00:39:56.930 --> 00:40:00.460
conversation telling you that I was in a hotel room in Italy and I had no idea

684
00:40:00.461 --> 00:40:01.241
where I was.
Well,

685
00:40:01.241 --> 00:40:04.360
what's the first thing that I started doing for the next few days after that

686
00:40:04.361 --> 00:40:09.361
trip is I would get up a half an hour earlier and I would completely ignore the

687
00:40:09.581 --> 00:40:14.050
breakfast that was at my hotel with my team and I would go out and I would walk

688
00:40:14.051 --> 00:40:17.470
the streets and I would find a local place to have my Cappuccino in the morning

689
00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:21.700
because that set me up like,
okay,
I'm here,
I'm in Italy.

690
00:40:21.701 --> 00:40:26.290
I feel like I'm participating and it made me happy.
Right?
And that's the key.

691
00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:29.980
You're going to work better and you're going to work smarter when you set

692
00:40:29.981 --> 00:40:33.670
yourself up,
uh,
in ways that work for you and your body.

693
00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:39.850
So we've gone through the whole trip and it's time to come home,
right?

694
00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:42.580
What is it about business travel,
our travel?

695
00:40:42.581 --> 00:40:45.130
How can you create these routines?

696
00:40:45.131 --> 00:40:48.670
How can you live well on the road so that you can work smarter in yield,

697
00:40:48.671 --> 00:40:52.690
better results for you in your personal life and for the business that you're

698
00:40:52.691 --> 00:40:57.040
taking care of.
So it's important that you create these pre-travel routines.

699
00:40:57.041 --> 00:40:59.260
It's important that you work them and stick to them.

700
00:40:59.261 --> 00:41:02.500
They're going to change throughout your,
your time that you're using them.

701
00:41:02.501 --> 00:41:04.130
And that's okay.
Um,

702
00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:07.150
and what you need to do is once you find things that work for you,

703
00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:12.010
you need to condition yourself and unique to condition those around you for your

704
00:41:12.011 --> 00:41:16.270
return.
So what does that mean exactly?
Do you know?
Like,
okay,

705
00:41:16.271 --> 00:41:20.050
I'm going to take a red eye may and maybe your company offers comp time.

706
00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:23.260
So you worked on a weekend,
you're taking a red eye,
you land,

707
00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:26.470
you're landing Monday morning.
Are you expected to be in the office right away?

708
00:41:26.471 --> 00:41:30.180
If not,
see if you can give yourself a date of recover,
uh,

709
00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:32.140
or if you are expected to be in the office,

710
00:41:32.141 --> 00:41:36.080
maybe you can plan your week out and you push all your meetings till Wednesday.

711
00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:38.300
So you give yourself time to recover.

712
00:41:38.301 --> 00:41:42.650
You give yourself a little break and it sets others up for how they interact

713
00:41:42.651 --> 00:41:43.484
with you.

714
00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:46.970
What I love to do and I've learned throughout the years is my out of office

715
00:41:46.971 --> 00:41:47.840
notification.

716
00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:53.440
So what I do is I place my out of office notification to go live a day before I

717
00:41:53.511 --> 00:41:56.900
leave and not to end until a day after I come home.

718
00:41:57.110 --> 00:41:58.910
And what's nice about that is again,

719
00:41:58.911 --> 00:42:02.120
it's setting up others that I'm might not be available.

720
00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:05.690
Of course I have the option to turn it off early or go back to work early.

721
00:42:05.691 --> 00:42:10.691
But what this does is it creates boundaries and it creates expectations for

722
00:42:10.701 --> 00:42:12.200
those around you and,

723
00:42:12.201 --> 00:42:16.580
and sort of trains them on what you found to work for you when it comes to

724
00:42:16.581 --> 00:42:19.640
business travel.
So thank you guys.

725
00:42:19.641 --> 00:42:22.850
It was a pleasure to be here and I hope you learned a little something that you

726
00:42:22.851 --> 00:42:25.330
can take with you on your next trip.
Um,

727
00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:28.790
I'm thrilled that you're going to get a copy of the book and I hope that you can

728
00:42:28.791 --> 00:42:32.370
find more tips and tricks in there that will help you travel.
Um,

729
00:42:32.371 --> 00:42:36.470
and I mentioned to you,
I do run PROBASCO,
which is a wellness travel company,

730
00:42:36.471 --> 00:42:40.040
and I'm thrilled to say that we are actually part of the Google perks program.

731
00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:44.740
So if there is ever an opportunity that you guys want to take a vacation,
um,

732
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:47.930
whether a group setting or a private setting,
uh,

733
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:50.180
because we're part of the Google PR perks program,

734
00:42:50.181 --> 00:42:52.640
there's some added discounts in there as well.

735
00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:55.510
So hopefully I can see you guys on the road.
Um,

736
00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:57.560
we do have a little setup for Q and.
A.

737
00:42:57.561 --> 00:43:01.310
If anyone has any questions that they want to ask,
I'm happy to answer them.

738
00:43:01.311 --> 00:43:06.020
If not,
that's okay.
Any questions?
No.
Okay,

739
00:43:06.021 --> 00:43:09.920
cool.
All right.
Thank you.
I really appreciate it.
It was lovely to be here.
