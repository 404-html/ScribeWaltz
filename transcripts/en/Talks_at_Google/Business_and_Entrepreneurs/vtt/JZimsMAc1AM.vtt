1
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.020
[inaudible]

2
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.190
<v 0>thank you so much.</v>

3
00:00:12.191 --> 00:00:16.750
I appreciate the introduction and a real happy to be here with you all today.
Um,

4
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.750
so it's a privilege to come out and speak at Google and share my story and I

5
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.390
look forward to giving you an overview of what motivates me to start this

6
00:00:25.391 --> 00:00:29.500
company and how I try to make a difference and all that I do here through this

7
00:00:29.501 --> 00:00:33.040
company,
Purple Carrot and uh,
look forward to our discussion.

8
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.190
So I thought I'd start off today with an image of our four kids.

9
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.390
Uh,
it's not necessarily to ask you to Ooh,
not how cute they are though.

10
00:00:43.391 --> 00:00:47.410
I do think they're pretty cute.
I'm a little biased as their father.
Uh,

11
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:48.041
but you know,

12
00:00:48.041 --> 00:00:52.810
these guys really give me a ton of motivation and inspiration to succeed and

13
00:00:52.811 --> 00:00:54.100
make a difference in the world.

14
00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.570
And I think about the world that they're going to inherit and quite frankly,

15
00:00:58.571 --> 00:01:02.170
the world that each of us is going to be inheriting in the years ahead.

16
00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.590
And it's pretty scary to think about what's happening right now.
Uh,

17
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.360
I see myself as an optimist.
I'm usually a half full kind of guy.

18
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.680
But when you look out and you read the news stories and you see some of the
data,

19
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.300
uh,
it's enough to give you pause about what our future looks like.

20
00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.870
And there's some people that might say it's even too late to make some

21
00:01:22.871 --> 00:01:26.860
meaningful changes that could alter the trajectory of the way our planet is

22
00:01:26.861 --> 00:01:27.670
headed.

23
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.320
But I'd like to believe that if we start acting together in a meaningful and

24
00:01:32.321 --> 00:01:33.154
deliberate way,

25
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.430
there's a good chance that we can change the course of our future.
Uh,

26
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.560
I want to think about creating a great world for these kids to grow up in.

27
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.250
And so,
uh,
this is my story.

28
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.180
So I'm borrowing an image that,
uh,
was,

29
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.290
I was reminded by from Leonardo Dicaprio and he was serving as the host of a new

30
00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:57.010
film that came out a few months ago called before the flood.

31
00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.950
I'm not sure if any of you have seen that,
but,
uh,

32
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.780
this picture really resonated with me.

33
00:02:01.781 --> 00:02:06.690
I was an art history major in college many years ago.
And,
uh,
this is a,
uh,

34
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.480
image called the garden of earthly delights by Hieronymus Bosch.

35
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.880
It was made about 600 years ago and it's never been more timely to take a look

36
00:02:15.881 --> 00:02:20.600
at this.
So,
uh,
it's a very large tryptic.
If we take a look at the first,
uh,

37
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.560
leftmost part of the painting,
you see,

38
00:02:23.561 --> 00:02:27.790
it's a really nice idyllic setting.
There's plenty of light.

39
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.750
There's not many people.
It's not overcrowded.
Uh,

40
00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.490
people seem pretty happy.
It's relaxed,
it's open.
It feels pretty nice.

41
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.410
As we shift into the middle panel of the triptych,

42
00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.980
you started to see things changing a bit.
There's a lot of overcrowding.

43
00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.510
It's a ton of people.
There is some partying,
there's sex,
there's drinking,

44
00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.340
people were having a great time.
And,
uh,

45
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.920
it's starts to take a shift from the earlier stages that we saw in that image,

46
00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.790
uh,
into something that starts to get a little bit like overcrowding and the

47
00:03:00.791 --> 00:03:05.530
situation that we might be living in today.
And then at the end is we had to,

48
00:03:05.531 --> 00:03:09.910
the far right part of the image,
you see,
it's really decided to leave very dark.

49
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.960
There's death,
there's destruction,
there's fires.
Uh,

50
00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:16.180
there's a lot of concerning elements to this image.

51
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.330
I think I can see an image of Donald Trump and the bottom right corner there.

52
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.280
And it's just a scary view of what might be happening in our future.

53
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.430
And a,
for a guy that painted this more than 600 years ago,

54
00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:31.270
it's worth taking note to think about what this could mean for all of us in our

55
00:03:31.271 --> 00:03:35.550
future.
So as I,
uh,

56
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.491
I've heard in the opening,

57
00:03:36.491 --> 00:03:40.810
I spent a lot of my life in the pharmaceutical industry about 20 years promoting

58
00:03:40.811 --> 00:03:44.920
the value of western medicine and still strongly believe in the value that,

59
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.140
uh,
the drugs that are created in this country are great and can be life changing

60
00:03:50.141 --> 00:03:50.974
and life saving.

61
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.780
But with all those medicines that are available to us today and all the

62
00:03:55.781 --> 00:03:57.910
awareness that is happening in our country,

63
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.210
there's still some pretty scary statistics that are worth pointing out.

64
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.590
For starters,
70% of us are overweight or obese.

65
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.640
And that's just a shocking stat to see.
Um,

66
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.120
the way people are consuming food and the way they exercise or don't exercise to

67
00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:14.890
be in that type of situation.

68
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.270
One in three of us are going to die of heart disease and that actually makes

69
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.910
heart disease,

70
00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.910
America's number one killer and largely driven by the food choice that we make.

71
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.170
And on top of that,

72
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.440
50% of us are going to be diabetic or prediabetic by 2030 and these are three

73
00:04:32.411 --> 00:04:37.411
health conditions that are all chronic in nature and that all can be reduced or

74
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.990
reversed by incorporating a plant based diet.

75
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.140
But I think if we continue to eat the sugary,
you know,

76
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.880
me donuts and fried chicken and other things that are bringing a lot of uh,

77
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.670
health issues upon us,
things are not going to change

78
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.220
environmentally.

79
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.660
It's not much better when you look out and you think about 50% of our land is

80
00:04:58.661 --> 00:05:01.060
currently allocated to animal agriculture.

81
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.080
And to me that just feels like an incredibly inefficient use of our land.

82
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:06.750
And it's,
you know,

83
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.500
our choice to continue to raise cattle that is only raised for slaughter,

84
00:05:11.501 --> 00:05:16.501
largely raised for slaughter to feed our massive consumption of meat and dairy

85
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.030
and these sort of oversized supersized type of appetites that people have

86
00:05:22.031 --> 00:05:22.864
developed.

87
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.340
Now if you're a farmer and you were fortunate enough to have an acre of land to

88
00:05:27.341 --> 00:05:30.700
work with and you decided,
well,
what should I do with that acre of land?

89
00:05:30.701 --> 00:05:32.950
And you said the heck I'm going to raise cattle,

90
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.960
we can think about how a farmer's going to think about that product and how they

91
00:05:37.961 --> 00:05:39.750
could use that,
uh,

92
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.840
animal to make a profit and sell food into the marketplace.

93
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:45.850
And the way they could use that product.

94
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:50.620
And if you're efficient with that cattle usage in that way where you're raised

95
00:05:50.621 --> 00:05:51.080
that cattle,

96
00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.240
you probably get about 375 pounds of beef that you're able to sell in the

97
00:05:55.241 --> 00:05:58.460
marketplace.
If you think that same acre of land,

98
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.140
you can get 37,500 pounds of plant based food from the same space.

99
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:09.080
So if you stop and think about the amount of hunger that is pervasive across

100
00:06:09.081 --> 00:06:13.640
this world and the growth of our population to be north of 9 billion people in

101
00:06:13.641 --> 00:06:17.630
2050,
we got to think about how we could change the way we consume food,

102
00:06:17.631 --> 00:06:20.240
how we produce food and the food choices that we make.

103
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.320
They could be a redeploying some of our land and our precious resources to feed

104
00:06:24.321 --> 00:06:26.030
those who are so hungry.
And so we need

105
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.800
from a water consumption perspective,

106
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:34.150
the meat and dairy industry is associated with the use of about one third of all

107
00:06:34.151 --> 00:06:35.410
the fresh water on our planet.

108
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.270
If you just stop and think about how much water is required to raise cattle to

109
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.330
uh,
continue to sort of move that process through the system,

110
00:06:43.331 --> 00:06:47.470
it's taking up a tremendous amount of very limited resource and coming out here

111
00:06:47.471 --> 00:06:51.160
to California,
I think about that even more as the city.

112
00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:55.000
This state rather has experienced a tremendous drought over the last five years.

113
00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.330
Things seem to be getting a little bit better,
but not a whole lot.

114
00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.890
And it's a concerning statement to think about how water is being allocated when

115
00:07:02.891 --> 00:07:04.480
it could be used in a far different way.

116
00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:06.190
<v 2>Okay.</v>

117
00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:09.460
<v 0>Building on that,
the headline from January this year,</v>

118
00:07:09.461 --> 00:07:13.330
was it the earth headache temperature record for the third year in a row?

119
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.650
And that talks about how we're going this incredible change in our environment

120
00:07:17.651 --> 00:07:20.680
that is considered to be unsustainable by most scientists.

121
00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:25.810
Though some would tell you that it's a fake news.
I would beg to disagree.

122
00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:30.970
Uh,
Arctic Sea ice hit a record low in the North Pole just a couple of months ago

123
00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.140
and that certainly clearly driven off of the global warming issues.

124
00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:39.130
And just last week there was a massive iceberg that broke off of the coast of

125
00:07:39.131 --> 00:07:43.360
Antarctica and it's just,
you know,
more bad news after more bad news.

126
00:07:43.361 --> 00:07:46.340
So again,
I'm not trying to paint such a miserable picture of the,

127
00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:47.560
of the world and what's happening,

128
00:07:47.561 --> 00:07:50.790
but it really points to some issues that we have.
Uh,

129
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:54.550
and a lot of those problems with respect to the environment come off of this

130
00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:59.020
incredible,
uh,
use of greenhouse gases are the emission of greenhouse gases.

131
00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:02.920
And about 18% of that is associated with agricultural farming.

132
00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:08.320
And so that type of practice is only causing a greater problems in our

133
00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:12.320
environment.
And uh,
that trumps all of the um,

134
00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:16.180
transportation emissions that people seem to associate with global warming.

135
00:08:16.181 --> 00:08:18.880
But in the agriculture is the number one culprit of that.

136
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.480
So when you think about all that data that I just shared with you,

137
00:08:22.481 --> 00:08:25.050
it's probably not hard to look back at this.
Uh,

138
00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:29.110
this image again of the garden of earthly delights and think about this image

139
00:08:29.111 --> 00:08:32.770
there on the far right is not too far off from where we could be headed if we

140
00:08:32.771 --> 00:08:33.670
don't make some changes.

141
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:38.290
And it was really for that reason that I decided to start my own company three

142
00:08:38.291 --> 00:08:39.730
years ago called the purple carrot.

143
00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:43.330
The purple carrot is the only a hundred percent plant based meal kit on the

144
00:08:43.331 --> 00:08:46.870
market and we provide all of the raw premeasured ingredients that people need to

145
00:08:46.871 --> 00:08:50.350
cook three meals every week that are exclusively plant based.

146
00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.740
Our whole mission is that we want to get people to eat more plants largely for

147
00:08:55.741 --> 00:08:57.210
the reasons that I described.

148
00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.450
And we think that there's a bright future in that and that we need to help more

149
00:09:00.451 --> 00:09:03.750
and more people start to think about eating more plants as a common way of life.

150
00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:06.390
It's a little bit of a weird statement to think about eating plants.

151
00:09:06.391 --> 00:09:09.990
I've never loved the term plant based because I feel like most of us don't go

152
00:09:09.991 --> 00:09:12.990
out there and think about,
you know,
God,
I can't wait to have some plants today.

153
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:17.150
It's not really a crave worthy,
uh,
way of thinking about it.
But,
uh,

154
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:20.880
there's a lot to that that we can try to uncover.
Uh,

155
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:23.580
it's awesome that here at Google,

156
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:28.560
Eric Schmidt made some predictions and comments about some of the most important

157
00:09:28.561 --> 00:09:29.730
tech trends that are out there.

158
00:09:29.731 --> 00:09:32.970
And the first one that he commented on was nerds over cattle,

159
00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:38.250
which is idea of using technology to drive the greater use of plant based foods

160
00:09:38.251 --> 00:09:39.390
and meat alternatives.

161
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:44.310
And it's great that he was so far ahead of the curve to be recommending that as

162
00:09:44.311 --> 00:09:46.620
a material,
a way we can improve the environment.

163
00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:51.270
And just saw yesterday this article in Fast Company about your quest to develop

164
00:09:51.271 --> 00:09:53.550
a plant based power dish more popular than meat.

165
00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:57.000
So I'm not sure if you were even aware of this as employees that uh,

166
00:09:57.001 --> 00:10:00.570
there's been some adjustments in the amount of meat content in the burgers and

167
00:10:00.571 --> 00:10:04.040
it's moving into some more uh,
mushrooms,
uh,
without,
uh,

168
00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:08.630
calling that out to see if people still enjoy it as much.
So,
uh,

169
00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:11.690
no matter the way you're approaching getting to a plant based and worlds,

170
00:10:11.691 --> 00:10:14.760
certainly here at Google,
it's nice to see that being so well embraced.

171
00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:21.330
So it's a big misconception that purple carrot is just for vegans.
Uh,

172
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.250
when I started the company almost three years ago,

173
00:10:23.251 --> 00:10:25.560
I always said this was Vegan food for non vegans.

174
00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:29.340
And I'm really thrilled to see that as our data represents,

175
00:10:29.341 --> 00:10:34.140
82% of our customer base are omnivorous and we have welcome surveys.

176
00:10:34.141 --> 00:10:39.030
When people sign up to subscribe to our service and they tell us what their
meal,

177
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.370
uh,
their dietary choices and preferences are.

178
00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:45.600
And so the fact that four out of five of them continue to eat sort of a full

179
00:10:45.601 --> 00:10:48.810
omnivorous diet is very encouraging because I think that's where the market is.

180
00:10:48.811 --> 00:10:51.830
That's where the opportunity is to change people's habits,
uh,

181
00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:56.230
exist and we're excited to be doing our part to help move them along.
Uh,

182
00:10:56.310 --> 00:11:00.620
we even created a word to characterize who our customers are.
Uh,

183
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.030
someone who is what we call it,
balance a terrarium.

184
00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.570
And this is a word we coined back in November of last year.

185
00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:10.930
The idea is that it's someone who still can embrace a plant based diet but

186
00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:15.480
doesn't totally divorced themselves from eating meat,
some dairy and some eggs.

187
00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:20.310
I think it's fair to recognize that it's really hard to be a Vegan.

188
00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:25.380
I'm not Vegan.
I eat a lot of plant based foods,
but um,
you know,

189
00:11:25.381 --> 00:11:29.370
the draw for dairy and some animal protein is pretty pronounced and sort of deep

190
00:11:29.371 --> 00:11:31.740
seated in our evolution as human beings.

191
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:36.150
And for those who are Vegan and who stick with a Vegan Diet,

192
00:11:36.151 --> 00:11:38.280
I think it's largely driven from ethical beliefs.

193
00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:41.680
And I really admire people who have the ability to uh,

194
00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:45.600
let that limit their food choices.
But for the majority of people out there,

195
00:11:45.601 --> 00:11:49.170
it's really hard to stick with the Diet of any type really.
Um,

196
00:11:49.171 --> 00:11:52.320
and Vegan is extremely limited in choices.

197
00:11:52.321 --> 00:11:54.580
There's certainly a lot more today than there ever has been.

198
00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:58.840
But our goal is to try to move people along a continuum that almost looks at us

199
00:11:58.841 --> 00:12:03.610
as sort of a gateway drug of sorts that the more you start craving and enjoying

200
00:12:03.611 --> 00:12:04.600
plant based meals,

201
00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:07.270
the less and less fuel are going to start to want to eat animal protein.

202
00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:10.720
The last you want to have dairy and the more mindful you'll be about the food

203
00:12:10.721 --> 00:12:12.730
choices that you,
uh,
you continue to make.

204
00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.370
So you can proudly say you are a balanced a terrarium.

205
00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:18.340
So the trends are certainly with us.

206
00:12:18.341 --> 00:12:21.220
This is about a pretty cool chart worth sharing.
It was a,
um,

207
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:25.030
an image I captured from Google trends and uh,

208
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:26.770
all the bright people at this company have this,

209
00:12:26.771 --> 00:12:31.710
a novel tool that allows guys like me to log in and type in the word plant based

210
00:12:31.711 --> 00:12:33.610
and see the trends over the last five years.

211
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.430
And it's pretty amazing to look over here and see this type of,

212
00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:39.130
of spike in the last few months around plant based.

213
00:12:39.131 --> 00:12:42.070
So it gives us a lot of hope and confidence that we're making a difference and

214
00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:46.840
getting on people's radar screen as the general consciousness is and increasing

215
00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:49.690
about the importance and value of plant based eating.

216
00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:55.900
Thought it might be worth just taking a moment or two talking a bit more about

217
00:12:55.901 --> 00:12:58.990
the category.
Um,
I'm not sure by show of hands how many people have,

218
00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:04.300
have or use a meal kit.
So you get the idea.
Um,

219
00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:09.360
it was started by a Matt who launched Blue Apron back in 2012.

220
00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:13.240
And uh,
nick from plated,
uh,
was at Harvard with him as well.

221
00:13:13.241 --> 00:13:16.120
And the two of those guys started similar companies.

222
00:13:16.121 --> 00:13:18.010
Blue Apron plated right around the same time.

223
00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:23.110
And Blue Apron was really runaway with sort of the dominant brand in the meal

224
00:13:23.111 --> 00:13:26.020
kit category.
Hellofresh came over from Europe,

225
00:13:26.021 --> 00:13:27.490
which is where the whole concept started.

226
00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:32.050
And those three companies sort of began the process about five years ago.

227
00:13:32.051 --> 00:13:35.620
And it's amazing to think that this industry is only five years old.

228
00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:41.200
The idea is that consumers can subscribe to these services and they are shipped

229
00:13:41.201 --> 00:13:44.800
all of the raw premeasured ingredients and little baggies or,
uh,

230
00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:47.490
bottles and containers that,
uh,

231
00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:52.420
really should make it a lot easier for people to cook at home every week.
Uh,

232
00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:53.080
you know,

233
00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.960
my wife and I would always talk and in the morning and be sitting there having

234
00:13:55.961 --> 00:13:58.020
breakfast and she might turn to me and say,
honey,

235
00:13:58.021 --> 00:13:59.050
what do we having for dinner tonight?

236
00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.840
And even though I started this company three years ago,

237
00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:04.090
I still get that question a lot,
but,
uh,

238
00:14:04.091 --> 00:14:07.060
it's made a little bit simpler thinking about,
you know,
maybe the choices are,

239
00:14:07.061 --> 00:14:11.110
well,
which purple carrot meals do we have in our refrigerator this week?
So,
uh,

240
00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:14.680
the idea is that it's really intended to make it easier for people to cook.

241
00:14:14.681 --> 00:14:18.250
They all come with these colorful recipe cards that explain step by step

242
00:14:18.251 --> 00:14:21.910
instructions with the before and after shots of what you're looking to create.

243
00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:23.080
Uh,

244
00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:26.710
provides sort of a curated experience of meals that all tend to go together in

245
00:14:26.711 --> 00:14:28.390
that particular week.
Uh,

246
00:14:28.391 --> 00:14:32.470
they can align specific to dare Terry needs or dietary preferences that you

247
00:14:32.471 --> 00:14:35.530
might have.
And it's a lot of fun.
It's a nice way to learn how to cook.

248
00:14:35.531 --> 00:14:39.100
And I think there's a lot of millennials who are also,

249
00:14:39.101 --> 00:14:43.960
I'm not as informed about how to cook as some of the older generations and look

250
00:14:43.961 --> 00:14:45.190
for guidance and meal kits,

251
00:14:45.191 --> 00:14:48.910
do a great job of providing that training and sort sorta tutorial experience.

252
00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.280
So from a business perspective though,

253
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.340
it's really become a very dynamic category.
Uh,

254
00:14:55.341 --> 00:14:58.520
what you see here on the screen or a couple of images about the different meal

255
00:14:58.521 --> 00:15:03.521
kit delivery companies in the food tech space and the growth from largely driven

256
00:15:03.951 --> 00:15:06.560
off of this part of the country or in Silicon Valley,

257
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:11.590
the massive influx of cash and capital into the food tech space.

258
00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:16.780
Food was sort of considered the new tech from a few years ago and a lot of money

259
00:15:17.391 --> 00:15:21.140
has rushed in.
A lot of it has been focused around the immediate delivery.

260
00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:25.700
And I think that those of you here can attest to the commonality of on demand,

261
00:15:25.701 --> 00:15:27.770
everything being here in 10 or 15 minutes.

262
00:15:27.771 --> 00:15:32.420
And just that incredible mindset that is really dominant here in this part of

263
00:15:32.421 --> 00:15:36.470
the country that may be less pronounced in other places that are certainly far

264
00:15:36.471 --> 00:15:39.200
less concentrated with population.

265
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:44.240
And a lot of hope has been placed on these rapid delivery options that
companies,

266
00:15:44.241 --> 00:15:47.360
but a lot of them are starting to fail or have been failing.
Uh,

267
00:15:47.361 --> 00:15:50.140
if they're not closed down already on these,
um,

268
00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:54.770
sort of VC dreams of where and how fast they're can be disruption in the

269
00:15:54.771 --> 00:15:55.604
marketplace.

270
00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:00.770
The category around food tech has just exploded though and you can see from this

271
00:16:00.771 --> 00:16:05.771
image the incredible amount of logos and brands and players that are all trying

272
00:16:06.051 --> 00:16:10.730
to pursue and make a bit of a difference and find their spot with their own

273
00:16:10.731 --> 00:16:15.300
offering.
Somewhere around the way people consume food.
Uh,

274
00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:16.310
as a frame of reference,

275
00:16:16.311 --> 00:16:20.570
the grocery business is about $800 billion category.

276
00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:25.990
The meal kit category is far smaller at about $5 billion with a lot of room for

277
00:16:26.961 --> 00:16:27.794
growth certainly.

278
00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:33.040
But the way people consume food and how frequently they do it is a big reason

279
00:16:34.101 --> 00:16:37.790
for a lot of these companies coming into play to try to disrupt the space.

280
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:41.270
Uh,
from a meal kit perspective,

281
00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:45.560
I'm really honored to see our name and sort of a pretty short list of companies

282
00:16:45.561 --> 00:16:50.240
that are considered leaders in the category.
Um,
what I show you here,

283
00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:52.010
what I would consider the leaders,

284
00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:55.820
I probably would add sun basket maybe at this point,
maybe instead of peach dish.

285
00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:59.240
Um,
but there's a relatively small group.

286
00:16:59.241 --> 00:17:02.630
We now have companies who I think have found their niche,
who are doing well,

287
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:04.470
who are growing.
Uh,

288
00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:09.050
and where I guess I would look at this is that purple carrot stands out as the

289
00:17:09.051 --> 00:17:11.690
only one that offers a 100% plant based meals.

290
00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:15.740
The rest of them really are focusing on pretty much the same type of offering.

291
00:17:15.741 --> 00:17:18.770
It's not to disparage those offerings,
they're all great,

292
00:17:18.771 --> 00:17:23.150
but I think that it leads to so much more competition for the same type of

293
00:17:23.151 --> 00:17:26.600
consumer who is looking to acquire who the companies are looking to acquire as

294
00:17:26.601 --> 00:17:31.601
subscribers and offering a pretty identical offering from any of these.

295
00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:36.200
And given the substantial venture capital investment that these,

296
00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:37.910
that these companies have received,

297
00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:41.600
they're able to use those dollars to offer free trials and you know,

298
00:17:41.601 --> 00:17:44.360
first box free or 50% off these orders.

299
00:17:44.361 --> 00:17:49.361
And it creates a pretty promiscuous user base where you can game system,

300
00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:54.570
you can try any one of these companies including ours,
uh,
and shift,

301
00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:57.330
you know,
each different week and get discounts.
Ours,

302
00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:00.700
we don't discount ours much kind of for that reason.
Uh,

303
00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:03.150
we don't want to play that game,
but there's a big,

304
00:18:03.151 --> 00:18:07.980
big shift of the way people are thinking about how they consume meals and the

305
00:18:07.981 --> 00:18:08.940
category is growing.

306
00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:12.120
I think it's a pretty exciting space to be in and it's an honor to be in this

307
00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.490
short list.
Now,

308
00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:17.520
there is a new player in the category that just came out a couple of weeks ago.

309
00:18:17.521 --> 00:18:21.090
You might've heard of this company,
they're called Amazon.
Uh,

310
00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:24.180
it's a little bit scary when,
you know,
being in this space,

311
00:18:24.181 --> 00:18:27.720
you see a name like that announcing that they're entering the category.

312
00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:29.753
Uh,
you know,

313
00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:33.990
Jeff Bezos and team are pretty dominant force and what they want to do and

314
00:18:33.991 --> 00:18:34.471
disrupt.

315
00:18:34.471 --> 00:18:37.650
You've got to give them a lot of respects and belief that they can do whatever

316
00:18:37.651 --> 00:18:41.370
they really want to do given their infrastructure,
their knowledge,

317
00:18:41.371 --> 00:18:45.630
their financial capabilities,
supply chain control,
uh,
reach,

318
00:18:45.631 --> 00:18:49.710
consumer engagement.
The list goes on.
So,
you know,

319
00:18:49.711 --> 00:18:54.150
seeing that it was both like,
oh no,
great,
and then great.

320
00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:54.961
Oh No,
you know,

321
00:18:54.961 --> 00:18:58.290
that sort of happening that in the same moment when I saw that news.
But,
uh,

322
00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:01.200
they're now into the mix with a meal gets thrown own.
So we'll see.

323
00:19:01.201 --> 00:19:03.300
I think is still pretty much in a Beta phase,

324
00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:07.120
offering it to a limited number of people in the Seattle area through hello

325
00:19:07.121 --> 00:19:10.560
fresh but,
uh,
in through a Amazon fresh rather.
But,
um,

326
00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:14.610
it probably won't be long before they become slightly more involved in this

327
00:19:14.611 --> 00:19:15.444
category.

328
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:20.990
They even filed a trademark to do meal kits and that has been a bit of a pain

329
00:19:21.901 --> 00:19:26.580
point for blue apron,
which went public just the end of June,

330
00:19:26.581 --> 00:19:28.200
right around the same time this is happening.

331
00:19:28.201 --> 00:19:32.670
So it's pretty current information that I'm sharing here and it does make me

332
00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:36.600
wonder if at Salzburg did something to piss off Jeff Bezos because it's,

333
00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:41.070
it's shocking to see the timing and I feel a little bad for him.
But you know,

334
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:45.330
when,
uh,
they launched their IPO at $10 a share,
just the end of June,

335
00:19:45.331 --> 00:19:47.550
it's now trading around six 75 or so.

336
00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:52.790
And it's really been under pressure largely from a Amazon's decision to move

337
00:19:53.101 --> 00:19:56.550
into the meal kit space.
Uh,
they've really been,
um,

338
00:19:57.170 --> 00:20:01.500
sort of battered down by the news that Amazon is doing that they're also of

339
00:20:01.501 --> 00:20:02.640
course,
uh,

340
00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:06.300
further hurt by the fact that Amazon is also announced that they are buying

341
00:20:06.301 --> 00:20:09.770
whole foods market for almost $14 billion.
Uh,

342
00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:13.290
and the timing of those two announcements came right after the other one before

343
00:20:13.291 --> 00:20:16.830
the other actually.
And that's been a big problem for blue apron.

344
00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:20.130
As Amazon sits out there as a big competitor in the space.

345
00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:24.880
It certainly isn't competitive.
Uh,
to me it purple carrot in our business.
Um,

346
00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:27.660
so interesting times,
uh,

347
00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:31.260
I thought it was worth sharing this image that I found that was incredible to

348
00:20:31.261 --> 00:20:35.670
see it as much as you see how they negatively impacted Blue Apron and their

349
00:20:35.671 --> 00:20:37.410
recent IPO in their stock price.

350
00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:41.160
How as soon as Amazon announced the acquisition of whole foods,

351
00:20:41.161 --> 00:20:45.120
what it did to the grocery category to see Walmart,
Kroger,
target,

352
00:20:45.121 --> 00:20:47.940
and Costco get totally pummeled.
Uh,

353
00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:51.890
the only one that went up of course was whole foods through that acquisition.
Um,

354
00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:56.740
I believe that also Amazon announced they're moving into replacing a geek squad

355
00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:57.700
at best buy,

356
00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:02.080
best buy offers traditionally and best buy had the similar type of negative

357
00:21:02.081 --> 00:21:06.180
impacts.
So Amazon's a really substantial player in the category.
Um,

358
00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:11.240
and probably other than Google is a sort of dominant player out there.
Uh,

359
00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:13.780
you have to give them a lot of respect for what they can do.

360
00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:18.220
So it sort of feels like this is the moment where I'm that little gun in the

361
00:21:18.221 --> 00:21:21.370
diaper practically and you know,
facing up against this,

362
00:21:21.371 --> 00:21:26.200
a really strong competitor to think how in God's name am I going to be able to

363
00:21:26.201 --> 00:21:31.060
compete with these huge players?
And it is.
Um,
it's really been a challenge,

364
00:21:31.061 --> 00:21:34.540
I think since I launched the company where I wasn't a food guy,

365
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:36.670
I was not a VC.

366
00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:41.440
I'd come from a 20 year history in the pharmaceutical world and I think people

367
00:21:41.441 --> 00:21:45.610
thought you're launching a Vegan product is a very small percentage of vegans

368
00:21:45.611 --> 00:21:48.010
out there.
I think depending on what study you believe,

369
00:21:48.011 --> 00:21:51.760
it's anywhere from two to 6% of the population.
And people said,
Andy,

370
00:21:51.761 --> 00:21:54.580
why doesn't people,
why does it Blue Apron?
Just go do their own Vegan line?

371
00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:57.280
And it was really hard to get out there.

372
00:21:57.281 --> 00:22:00.950
So I'm proud of the fact that here we are almost three years later,
uh,

373
00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:02.920
a part of the national conversation around meal kits,

374
00:22:02.921 --> 00:22:05.560
but it's only gonna get harder and more competitive.

375
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:09.910
And so I'll spend last couple of minutes talking about what I see is a part of

376
00:22:09.911 --> 00:22:14.710
our ways to succeed.
Because the guy in the screen here,

377
00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.590
you may know him,
his name is Guy Kawasaki,

378
00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:22.210
a guy who is an incredible thinker.
Uh,
he's,
uh,

379
00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:25.540
now a venture capitalist.
He was most well known,

380
00:22:25.541 --> 00:22:29.260
I think for being the first evangelists at apple computers.

381
00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:32.470
And now probably 30 plus years ago,

382
00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:35.620
guy was out there evangelizing apple to,
uh,

383
00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:40.610
to schools to get apple computer to be known.
And it was a,
you know,

384
00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:44.130
a very little known company back then.
And Guy was,
uh,

385
00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:47.640
this very innovative thinker and he has,
uh,

386
00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:51.460
evolved into the world of VC and he wrote a book called art of the start.

387
00:22:51.461 --> 00:22:54.820
And I read that book back in end of 2006 actually.

388
00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:58.960
And it's always stayed with me.
And,
um,
some great things.

389
00:22:58.961 --> 00:23:01.090
So if anyone's in here thinking about starting their own company,

390
00:23:01.091 --> 00:23:03.940
I'd highly recommend you take a look at this book,
Art of the start.

391
00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:07.600
And the first thing that guy talks about in there is this idea that he says make

392
00:23:07.601 --> 00:23:11.830
meaning.
It's different from make money.
Uh,

393
00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:14.770
and while he is a venture capitalist and thinks about that and it's probably

394
00:23:14.771 --> 00:23:19.210
made a ton of money in his life.
Uh,
and as much as I want to make money in mind,

395
00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:24.390
the idea about sort of focusing your decisions and deciding how you want to go

396
00:23:24.701 --> 00:23:29.410
about building a company is having it grounded with the underpinning about make

397
00:23:29.411 --> 00:23:29.950
meaning.

398
00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:32.860
And that's been really pronounced in the way I've thought about building out

399
00:23:32.861 --> 00:23:36.190
purple carrot about providing something that's plant based that has all the

400
00:23:36.191 --> 00:23:38.470
benefits that we talked about upfront.
Uh,

401
00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:42.130
that creates a meaningful opportunity to establish ourselves and do something

402
00:23:42.131 --> 00:23:46.910
that is inherently different from a lot of the other competitors in the
category.

403
00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:52.040
So I really love this artist's name is Hugh macleod and he creates something

404
00:23:52.041 --> 00:23:56.480
called gaping void.
So,
uh,
if you're not familiar with fewer his work,

405
00:23:56.510 --> 00:24:00.980
I'd encourage you to check out gaping void.com and you can sign up and get this

406
00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:03.380
daily feed a of his doodles.

407
00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:07.730
And this one I saw several years ago and it also stayed with me a lot,

408
00:24:07.731 --> 00:24:12.350
which is this idea of living on the edges are not at all.
And you know,

409
00:24:12.351 --> 00:24:13.250
seeing that it just,

410
00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:17.090
it felt like the whole idea was to stand out and be different and be

411
00:24:17.091 --> 00:24:20.580
distinguished and it's,
you know,
scary and it's exciting.
Um,

412
00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:23.180
but that's how you'll get noticed.
And I,
sorry,

413
00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:28.160
I followed up on that image recently to see a bit more about what he wrote
about.

414
00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:29.870
I thought I'd read this to you.
He says,

415
00:24:29.871 --> 00:24:33.620
just as sheep moved to the center of the flock for purely survival reasons,

416
00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:37.910
so to human beings,
it's why we wear Khakis and join tennis clubs.

417
00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:42.620
But some of us moved to the edges for the exact same reason.
Survival.

418
00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:44.540
If we stay in the middle,

419
00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:48.200
we're just going to get creamed like everybody else wants the market moves on.

420
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:53.930
I think Google is probably by the most innovative,
Edgy company out there.

421
00:24:53.931 --> 00:24:56.090
So I would imagine this resonates.
Uh,

422
00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:58.430
but I thought that was pretty cool to see that.
And again,

423
00:24:58.431 --> 00:25:03.431
going to that edge of providing sort of Vegan food for non vegans was the edge.

424
00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.830
Uh,
people said,
why don't you just offer a vegetarian option,

425
00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:09.650
which to me would be far more mainstream and simplistic,

426
00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:13.880
but all the other big guys have vegetarian options and none of them offer Vegan.

427
00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:16.850
And so that was the approach to go to the edge.

428
00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:22.400
So another guy who I love is a guy by the name of Seth Godin and he's

429
00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:23.780
photographed here for you.

430
00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:28.900
And Seth is been one of the most pronounced influences,

431
00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:34.550
uh,
in my whole life.
And,
uh,
I think he's a genius of a guy.

432
00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:37.820
He's written a ton of books.
If you don't know Seth,
uh,

433
00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:41.330
really encourage you to check out Seth goden.com and sign up for his blog can

434
00:25:41.331 --> 00:25:43.190
click on his bald head and a,

435
00:25:43.191 --> 00:25:46.040
you can get his blog every day in every day for years.

436
00:25:46.041 --> 00:25:49.040
He writes an incredible blog that you'll get in your inbox for free.

437
00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:51.500
And he's just a brilliant writer.

438
00:25:51.501 --> 00:25:53.960
He's written a lot of books and he does wonderful work.

439
00:25:53.961 --> 00:25:56.900
So I can't say enough great things about him,

440
00:25:56.901 --> 00:26:01.400
but one of the books that he's written of the 18 or 20 bucks or so out there is

441
00:26:01.401 --> 00:26:02.660
a book called Purple Cow.

442
00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:07.130
And purple cow is all about being remarkable and gets a transform your business

443
00:26:07.131 --> 00:26:11.960
by being remarkable is the subtext.
And the storyline with purple cow is that,

444
00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:14.450
you know,
if you're driving out,
he was driving with his family and France,

445
00:26:14.451 --> 00:26:14.871
I believe,

446
00:26:14.871 --> 00:26:19.610
and he was going along and pass this pastor and there's cows and they stop in it

447
00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:21.770
first,
I think,
no,
that's cool.
There's these cows.

448
00:26:21.771 --> 00:26:25.310
And then in a minute it's not that interesting when there's just all these cows.

449
00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:29.810
And he said,
imagine if you saw a purple cow,
you would stop the car,

450
00:26:29.811 --> 00:26:31.910
you'd get out,
you'd take pictures,
you tell all your friends.

451
00:26:31.911 --> 00:26:35.750
And it was this idea of creating a purple cow or something that is remarkable,

452
00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:40.610
that forces you almost given its remarkable nature to tell people about it and

453
00:26:40.611 --> 00:26:45.060
speak to others and spread the word.
So when I think about purple cow,

454
00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:48.570
that was sort of the genesis of the name of my company,
Purple Carrot.

455
00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:52.560
I remember thinking about starting this company and walking down Park Avenue

456
00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:55.560
South in New York City one night.
And it just hit me and I said,
okay,

457
00:26:55.561 --> 00:27:00.160
that's the name of my Vegan company.
Purple Cow,
Purple Carrot Rather,
still slip.

458
00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:04.350
And uh,
so it's,
uh,
it's been great and it's really about,
you know,

459
00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:06.840
being different.
So,
um,
thought about,
well,

460
00:27:06.841 --> 00:27:10.590
how could we be remarkable in our space?
What can we do to stand out?

461
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:14.810
Uh,
what you see on the screen here is an image of,
um,

462
00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:18.480
of me talking about one of our meals.
And,
uh,

463
00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:20.750
this dish here is a [inaudible],

464
00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:23.430
which most people would probably don't even know how to pronounce and took me a

465
00:27:23.431 --> 00:27:27.900
little while to get that right for the video.
Um,
but the idea is that,
you know,

466
00:27:27.901 --> 00:27:32.880
it came from a a moment that my wife and I had a few months earlier where the

467
00:27:32.881 --> 00:27:37.320
last meal we had at home that week was called Tofu Halloumi and it was one of

468
00:27:37.321 --> 00:27:39.000
our meals for purple carrot.

469
00:27:39.001 --> 00:27:43.710
And I didn't know what Halloumi was and I wasn't that excited about what that

470
00:27:43.711 --> 00:27:44.850
seemed like it was going to be.

471
00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:49.830
And we ended up making it and it was one of my favorite purple carrot meals I've

472
00:27:49.831 --> 00:27:52.320
had in three years.
And I thought,
God,
you know,

473
00:27:52.321 --> 00:27:55.620
people really need to understand what our meals are because we do have some

474
00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:01.260
unique and not common names to our products or to our recipes each week.

475
00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:04.830
And it,
it's part of the adventure of trying plant based meals.

476
00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:09.780
Okonomiyaki is no different as far as not a commonplace name.

477
00:28:09.781 --> 00:28:13.770
And so I felt like if I can get out there and talk about one of the three meals

478
00:28:13.771 --> 00:28:15.000
every week through video,

479
00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:20.160
post that to social as well as a share that over email to our database.

480
00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:23.820
There might be another reason for someone who has all those choices from the

481
00:28:23.821 --> 00:28:25.290
number of companies that I shared with you.

482
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:28.860
That instead of looking at something and saying,
hmm,
I've never heard of that,

483
00:28:28.861 --> 00:28:31.920
I'm not going to take the risk of spending money on a product that's gonna make

484
00:28:31.921 --> 00:28:36.000
me look foolish at home.
But hearing from me or someone on my company,

485
00:28:36.001 --> 00:28:39.330
I was the one that they nominated to do it.
So I said,
okay.
Um,

486
00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:41.200
unfortunately these of these,
um,

487
00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:44.490
converted at about six times the rate of our typical emails.

488
00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:49.170
So it's been really cool to see video and the conductivity we're building with

489
00:28:49.171 --> 00:28:53.940
our customer base to create a real emotional connection with them so that they

490
00:28:53.941 --> 00:28:57.310
feel connected to our product and that they feel a reason to stick with us and

491
00:28:57.311 --> 00:28:59.170
to continue to subscribe,
uh,

492
00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:02.330
and not maybe choose other options that they have on the marketplace.

493
00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:05.950
Something else that feels very,
uh,

494
00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:09.640
probably Google ask that maybe has already been developed here.
Um,

495
00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:14.310
it's something that we are looking about releasing in a purple carrot app that

496
00:29:14.311 --> 00:29:19.050
will soon to be developed that will allow people to track their impact and to

497
00:29:19.051 --> 00:29:24.051
create sort of a gamification system of sorts that as you use purple carrot and

498
00:29:24.241 --> 00:29:26.670
you can track and see how much water you've saved,

499
00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:30.870
how much carbon emissions you've reduced through your choice of meals,
uh,

500
00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:35.220
and create sort of a competitive gamified experience from you and your friends.

501
00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:35.371
You know,

502
00:29:35.371 --> 00:29:38.520
this idea of a network effect that your product is how can you make your product

503
00:29:38.521 --> 00:29:41.170
better when your friends are using it also,
right?

504
00:29:41.171 --> 00:29:45.070
So the famous example is the first guy who bought a fax machine and what he was

505
00:29:45.071 --> 00:29:48.460
thinking to think who is going to send a fax to if nobody else had the machine.

506
00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:52.390
But you know,
how can you make purple carrot better,
more interesting,

507
00:29:52.391 --> 00:29:56.080
more sticky to our customer base so that,
you know,

508
00:29:56.081 --> 00:29:59.920
if you can create this gamified approach to make you feel like you're a part of

509
00:29:59.921 --> 00:30:01.150
something larger than yourself,

510
00:30:01.151 --> 00:30:04.030
by tracking your impact and seeing how this month,

511
00:30:04.031 --> 00:30:07.540
by eating these meals as compared to more traditional meals,

512
00:30:07.541 --> 00:30:11.680
that would be similar.
You've saved thousands and thousands of gallons of water.

513
00:30:11.681 --> 00:30:14.140
It's like,
you know,
leaving your shower on for three months instead,

514
00:30:14.141 --> 00:30:17.410
you've eaten these meals and so,
uh,
ways to do that.

515
00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:19.870
So we're excited about what that will look like for us.

516
00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:25.330
We've also partnered with guys,
some of you may have seen,
his name is Tom Brady.

517
00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:26.403
Uh,

518
00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:30.790
we've partnered with Tom and his colleagues at TB 12 back in March of this year.

519
00:30:30.791 --> 00:30:34.270
So we're about a four or five months into that partnership.
Uh,

520
00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:38.230
it's a three year engagement that we have with,
with him.
And you know,

521
00:30:38.231 --> 00:30:42.440
Tom is at about an 80% plant based eater,
uh,

522
00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:47.520
and he represents to me the absolute pinnacle of success for a human being to

523
00:30:49.451 --> 00:30:51.490
achieve all that he's achieved.
Uh,

524
00:30:51.491 --> 00:30:56.491
he turns 40 next week and he's playing at the top of his game and he assigns a

525
00:30:56.801 --> 00:31:01.801
lot of value to the foods that he eats as a key component to his longterm

526
00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:03.640
success.
Uh,

527
00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:08.700
so TB 12 is all about sleep and muscle pliability and nutrition and mental

528
00:31:09.131 --> 00:31:10.720
energy and hydration.

529
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:15.250
And so as five of those key components exist for them,

530
00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:17.530
purple carrot fit in really nicely.

531
00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:19.750
And when we went out and spoke with those guys,
uh,

532
00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:23.500
last fall we talked to them about purple carrot and the potential to create a

533
00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:26.920
long term partnership and develop the TB 12 performance meals.

534
00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:29.740
And so we're really thrilled that,
uh,

535
00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:33.590
Tom is a partner with us and has allowed us to create sort of a new,

536
00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:36.660
not a new line extension from purple carrots.

537
00:31:36.661 --> 00:31:39.880
So we have our core meals that feed two people,

538
00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:43.930
we have a family plan and then now we offer these TB 12 performance meals,

539
00:31:43.931 --> 00:31:47.680
which are gluten free as well as plant based and slightly higher in protein.

540
00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:51.730
And so it's a nother way to differentiate and distinguish ourselves.

541
00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:54.730
And through our partnership,
uh,
we've created,

542
00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:59.770
tried to take that a level deeper by offering exclusive content that takes us

543
00:31:59.771 --> 00:32:03.220
beyond a meal kit.
But now you're really a part of the TB 12 line.

544
00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:08.830
A lot of people have signed up because they love Tom Brady,
uh,
um,
one of them.

545
00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:11.620
But there's also a whole desire for health.

546
00:32:11.621 --> 00:32:15.610
And so what we've created through these TB 12 newsletters is exclusive content

547
00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:19.660
that you can only get by being a subscriber.
And so,
uh,

548
00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:23.440
every other month we put out these,
uh,
these newsletters are eight pages.

549
00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:25.120
They are all designed in house.

550
00:32:25.121 --> 00:32:28.060
This is an example of one of the spreads that shows,
you know,

551
00:32:28.061 --> 00:32:30.530
various summer produce,
different sauces that uh,

552
00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:33.880
Tom might enjoy and things that are consistent with that.
Uh,

553
00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:37.510
we've featured 24 hours with Tom.
We've got questions with Tom,

554
00:32:37.511 --> 00:32:40.430
we've got sort of behind the scenes content that you're just not going to get

555
00:32:40.431 --> 00:32:43.690
anywhere else.
And again,
that's sort of an exclusive piece of,
uh,

556
00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:48.680
the way we can merchandise and make the most of this partnership.
We also have,

557
00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:52.800
uh,
the nice opportunity to send our subscribers a letter from Tom.

558
00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:56.110
You see that in the far left side with the little bit of a creepy guy who's

559
00:32:56.120 --> 00:33:00.890
there holding the image of Tom.
And then on the right,
it's actually a real,
um,

560
00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:04.310
autographed binder.
Uh,
the Tom signed 12 of these.

561
00:33:04.311 --> 00:33:09.200
Everything he does is in the 12 number.
Um,
as you can imagine with the number 12.

562
00:33:09.201 --> 00:33:13.310
And so what we did is when you order our,
uh,
our product,

563
00:33:13.311 --> 00:33:16.580
after your 12th boxes arrived,
after three months,
you'll get it,

564
00:33:16.581 --> 00:33:17.211
wouldn't bind her.

565
00:33:17.211 --> 00:33:20.780
That's got this TB 12 etching in it with the performance meals and it's a three

566
00:33:20.781 --> 00:33:23.060
ring binder that,
uh,
where you can con uh,

567
00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:27.140
retain an organized the recipe cards that we shipped that are also three hole

568
00:33:27.141 --> 00:33:31.420
punched.
And so 12 lucky people received an autographed,
uh,

569
00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:36.320
Tom Brady binder and people post on social and it just allows us to do things

570
00:33:36.321 --> 00:33:39.620
that really no other meal kit can do.
Uh,

571
00:33:39.621 --> 00:33:43.400
so we feel pretty good about where we're headed there.
And um,
you know,

572
00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:44.810
sort of comes down to this image.

573
00:33:44.811 --> 00:33:47.630
When I think about the sea of choices and what's out there,

574
00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:50.950
how can we stand out and how can you take all these choices and say,

575
00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:54.350
I'm the guy that they're going to pick.
Um,
and so,
uh,

576
00:33:54.351 --> 00:33:56.030
that's what drives me to try to do that.

577
00:33:56.420 --> 00:34:01.370
I'll leave you with this last image from a hue that I love and it just really

578
00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:05.210
spoke to me and a lot of the words that he shared when he posted this image

579
00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:08.450
about,
you know,
you try so hard and you're scared,

580
00:34:08.451 --> 00:34:09.680
you wake up in the middle of the night,

581
00:34:09.681 --> 00:34:12.350
you've got a pain in your side and you just do it cause you love it and you

582
00:34:12.351 --> 00:34:13.370
believe in the future.

583
00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:18.760
And so this idea of I love this and it's terrifying and I can tell you it is

584
00:34:18.951 --> 00:34:23.400
terrifying.
It's a thrill.
It's an honor to do what I do.
Uh,

585
00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:27.440
and I'm just looking to make a difference and,
uh,
hopefully we're succeeding.
So,

586
00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:31.460
uh,
thank you so much for listening and we can get in touch with me with that

587
00:34:31.461 --> 00:34:32.151
information there.

588
00:34:32.151 --> 00:34:35.360
And I'm happy to take any questions from anyone here or remotely.

589
00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:36.530
So thank you so much.

590
00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:46.070
<v 3>I was curious about like big food lobbying and like,</v>

591
00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:46.933
I'm sure,

592
00:34:47.150 --> 00:34:51.020
I mean obviously lobbyists have a big influence on like policies that encourage

593
00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:55.040
meat consumption and how much meat we sell in our grocery stores and

594
00:34:55.060 --> 00:35:00.060
advertisements for cool steaks on the grill and all of that stuff.

595
00:35:00.201 --> 00:35:04.610
So like,
do you like,
is there a way to like combat that because like,

596
00:35:04.611 --> 00:35:08.810
I would like to see more companies like this advertised and like senators

597
00:35:08.811 --> 00:35:13.140
fighting for plant based meals in public schools,
stuff like that.
Like,
yeah.

598
00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:14.420
Are there any like,

599
00:35:14.421 --> 00:35:19.130
things we could do to like scale this quickly or

600
00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:22.600
<v 0>thank you.
Uh,
I love the support.
Uh,</v>

601
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:27.270
and we just watched a documentary about two weeks ago called what the health,
uh,

602
00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:32.100
I'm not sure if you've seen it yet,
but it's really worth checking out.
Um,

603
00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:33.180
it,

604
00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:38.180
it really highlights the inherent conflict that between big food and our

605
00:35:40.801 --> 00:35:44.100
government and the presentation of,

606
00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:48.520
of meals in the recommendations that are made,
uh,
and,
and also with,
um,

607
00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:52.260
health advocacy groups with within the pharmaceutical world.

608
00:35:52.261 --> 00:35:55.470
It was really concerning to see the,
um,

609
00:35:55.471 --> 00:35:58.320
this misalignment of incentives where,
you know,

610
00:35:58.321 --> 00:36:01.410
the American Diabetes Association or the American Heart Association,

611
00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:05.580
which one would think as a consumer you can rely upon for good guidance.

612
00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:10.640
And then you start to see the amount of money and the funding that comes in from

613
00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:12.383
big industry.

614
00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:16.140
So whether that's the pharmaceutical companies or the large food manufacturers,

615
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:20.390
you know,
candy companies,
meet companies,
dairy companies,
the works,
there's,

616
00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:23.840
they're all part of that.
And you know,

617
00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:28.050
their goal is to further perpetuate the consumption of the foods and the

618
00:36:28.051 --> 00:36:33.000
products that they create and provide.
And there's that inherent misalignment.
So,

619
00:36:33.850 --> 00:36:37.830
you know,
I,
it's a big task to,
um,
sort of fight big government.

620
00:36:37.831 --> 00:36:40.950
I think documentaries like what the health to a really nice job of shining that

621
00:36:40.951 --> 00:36:45.330
bright light.
Um,
and I think it's,
you know,

622
00:36:45.331 --> 00:36:49.050
there's a bumper sticker that says,
you know,
when the,
when the,

623
00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:52.350
when the people lead,
the leaders will follow something like that.
You know,

624
00:36:52.351 --> 00:36:56.310
that it's that idea of that I think we have to start acting together,

625
00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:59.820
talks about,
you know,
what I said at the beginning of this,
our world is,
you know,

626
00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:02.670
on pretty precarious grounds.
Um,

627
00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:05.040
and I think as more people start to make those changes,

628
00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:08.550
it doesn't seem weird anymore to think about eating plant based and you know,

629
00:37:08.551 --> 00:37:11.580
amaze out here in California how much choice there is and how conscious,

630
00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:16.200
how aware of that is in,
and it's not everywhere like that.

631
00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:19.170
Right.
And so I think the more it becomes more mainstream,

632
00:37:19.171 --> 00:37:22.180
the more you see the growth of plant based searches,
uh,

633
00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:26.940
the more leaders get involved.
And I think the more change that,
you know,

634
00:37:26.941 --> 00:37:30.890
comes through a younger generation of millennials who are the,
you know,

635
00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:35.220
a very large cohort who also were the ones that are most interested in

636
00:37:35.221 --> 00:37:39.210
transparency in meat and dairy replacements,

637
00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:44.450
that that's gonna start shifting policies that will enable more of us to succeed

638
00:37:45.151 --> 00:37:48.870
through this.
So thank you.
Yeah.
Thank you.

639
00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:55.900
<v 3>Thank you so much.
Um,
so my question is about how you source your recipes.</v>

640
00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:56.350
Um,

641
00:37:56.350 --> 00:38:01.000
I've been like preparing plant based meals probably for about a year and a half.

642
00:38:01.170 --> 00:38:05.090
Um,
and I've done several purple carrot recipes and I find that,
um,

643
00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:09.160
there are very unique compared to a lot of the things you find on the Internet

644
00:38:09.161 --> 00:38:13.220
in terms of like the ways that you can create like really interesting thing.

645
00:38:13.221 --> 00:38:14.110
So for example,

646
00:38:14.290 --> 00:38:18.520
there was a recipe where you made scallops out of mushrooms and which was really

647
00:38:18.521 --> 00:38:20.740
awesome and tasted great.
Um,
so yeah,

648
00:38:20.741 --> 00:38:23.440
I'm just wondering like where these ideas come from and like she was working on

649
00:38:23.441 --> 00:38:25.910
the,
the recipes themselves.
Sure.
Yeah.

650
00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:27.360
<v 0>So by and large,</v>

651
00:38:27.361 --> 00:38:30.390
all the recipes that we make it purple carrot come from our own chefs.

652
00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:34.620
We have on staff.
So back in,
we're,
we're based in the Boston area.

653
00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:38.940
We've got about 30 employees,
uh,
on staff full time.
Uh,

654
00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:43.060
two of those are chefs and we got a couple of other sort of sous chefs and

655
00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:48.090
assistance to help order products for them to be testing in our test kitchen

656
00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:51.970
back in Boston.
We do outsource our fulfillment.

657
00:38:51.971 --> 00:38:56.440
And we have that happening in three centers in New York,
La,
in Ohio.
Um,

658
00:38:56.470 --> 00:39:00.140
so our,
our corporate offices,
if you will,
they're not that corporate,
but,
uh,

659
00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:04.810
the corporate office has these three folks and,
uh,
we have a test kitchen.

660
00:39:04.811 --> 00:39:06.910
And so our,
our chefs are,

661
00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:10.810
are just singularly focused on creating incredible plant based meals.

662
00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:16.230
We have parameters by which they need to stay from both like cost of the meals

663
00:39:16.271 --> 00:39:20.400
and the cost of ingredients,
uh,
the time it's gonna take to make a dish.
Um,

664
00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:22.200
some of the,
you know,

665
00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:25.570
we try not to have more than one of the three meals every week require a food

666
00:39:25.571 --> 00:39:28.450
processor just to find the balance,
not make them too complex,

667
00:39:28.451 --> 00:39:33.000
which we tend to be a little bit more chefy than maybe I would like.
But,
uh,

668
00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:37.960
it is that experience,
but the flavors,
you know,
it's,
I really have to just,

669
00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:43.090
you know,
um,
applaud the work that our chef sue to create incredible things.
They,

670
00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:45.340
um,
the mushroom dish you mentioned though,

671
00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:49.810
comes from a couple of friends of mine who run a company called wicked healthy.

672
00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:51.220
Uh,
Derek and Chad Sarno,

673
00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:55.150
who are really incredible vegan chefs and a,
yeah,

674
00:39:55.151 --> 00:40:00.151
they take these king oyster mushrooms and they taste and feel like scallops are

675
00:40:00.911 --> 00:40:04.870
incredible.
Um,
and so you'd never know that,
you know,

676
00:40:04.871 --> 00:40:08.860
for someone who wants to make those transition from eating a sort of a more

677
00:40:08.861 --> 00:40:12.640
traditional diet to one that's more plant based,
how,
um,

678
00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:14.080
how far things have come.

679
00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:19.000
And with innovation using oyster mushrooms that you slice and you saute a bit,

680
00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:24.040
uh,
it looks,
it tastes,
it feels like,
uh,
like a scalp.
So,

681
00:40:24.041 --> 00:40:28.020
um,
it's cool,
but there's,
um,
I think there's a,
uh,

682
00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:32.560
what we try to do is make our meals tastes so good that you don't miss the meat.

683
00:40:32.561 --> 00:40:35.410
You don't miss those flavors.
Um,
and again,

684
00:40:35.411 --> 00:40:37.450
we're trying to get someone to do that three nights a week.

685
00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:40.420
We're not saying be Vegan.
Uh,
as I said,
I'm not Vegan.

686
00:40:40.421 --> 00:40:43.270
I don't preach veganism through our company.
And I think that's,
you know,

687
00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:46.660
that's gotta be someone's personal choice for the majority of people that aren't

688
00:40:46.661 --> 00:40:49.540
choosing that.
I think if you start eating them this three nights a week,

689
00:40:49.541 --> 00:40:50.111
you might say,
wow,

690
00:40:50.111 --> 00:40:53.890
that's actually really good and you almost become more inclined to watch the

691
00:40:53.891 --> 00:40:56.980
documentary is to start seeing things and not as much in terms of the shocking,

692
00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:02.620
horrible animal treatment that exists that I think a lot of us stick our head in

693
00:41:02.621 --> 00:41:05.050
the sand and don't want to pay attention to that animal suffering.

694
00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:07.720
And we don't ever talk about that within our company.

695
00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:10.000
I think that's a hard thing to trade upon,

696
00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:13.690
but I think for those people that start to get curious about it and learn more,

697
00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:16.660
uh,
you begin that starts to seep in and you know,

698
00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:19.630
once the genie's out of the bottle,
it's hard to put it back in.
Um,

699
00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:23.770
and so if we can just get people to make some gentle shifts over time,
uh,

700
00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:26.020
without saying,
hey,
everybody's got to go be Vegan,

701
00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:27.850
that I think that's unsustainable.

702
00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:31.630
But if we can all make some subtle changes in our diet,

703
00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:35.210
the impact we can make collectively is really quite pronounced.

704
00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:39.290
<v 3>Hi,
thank you so much.
My name is Alex.
I work on Google Express.</v>

705
00:41:39.291 --> 00:41:43.760
And we try to connect people to their local stores like target and Costco.

706
00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:47.840
And I'm in doing,
so we noticed that when competing with Amazon,

707
00:41:47.841 --> 00:41:52.580
these local stores a struggle on the operation side and the shipping and how

708
00:41:52.581 --> 00:41:55.100
those purple carrot deal with that.

709
00:41:56.570 --> 00:41:59.970
<v 0>I take it a little bit deeper from the operations of just shipping to our</v>

710
00:41:59.971 --> 00:42:01.050
customers or

711
00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:05.540
<v 3>shipping to the customers and getting things within the two days or fast</v>

712
00:42:05.541 --> 00:42:08.810
delivery that other meal kit companies have also struggled with.

713
00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:12.580
<v 0>Sure.
Okay.
Thank you for the question.
So,
um,</v>

714
00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:14.680
when I first launched the company,

715
00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:18.540
we were started in my garage for the first month and then uh,

716
00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:23.290
we moved into a slightly more proper facility but it was not so proper.
And uh,

717
00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:26.740
we had no heat through that winter weight.
We launched in October,

718
00:42:26.741 --> 00:42:29.650
so November we were in this facility by December,

719
00:42:29.651 --> 00:42:33.310
it was starting to snow in Boston and it was just bloody cold for the next 90

720
00:42:33.311 --> 00:42:35.680
days and a lot of snow that winter.

721
00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:40.750
And we were in this warehouse with no heat and you know,
our product was,

722
00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:43.480
we weren't so worried about it losing freshness,

723
00:42:43.481 --> 00:42:47.770
but we're limiting it to one and two day ground shipping with a FedEx truck.
Um,

724
00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:51.760
we use insulation and Gel packs and um,
the produce would hold up.

725
00:42:51.761 --> 00:42:54.670
We were learning that,
you know,
Bazell might wilt,
uh,

726
00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:59.500
almost gets too cold and it would turn black and it would perish as we moved

727
00:42:59.501 --> 00:43:02.350
into the summer with no air conditioning either.
Uh,

728
00:43:02.410 --> 00:43:06.700
and we're in this warehouse that was just like 90 degrees.
It was miserable.

729
00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:11.140
Those products would also start to wilt in the heat.
So that wasn't,

730
00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:14.800
we sort of quickly got ourselves out of that as we realized that was not working

731
00:43:14.801 --> 00:43:18.160
so well.
Uh,
we're in the box and still be a lot of,
you know,

732
00:43:18.161 --> 00:43:21.640
for Gel packs and thick insulation.
Um,
and again,

733
00:43:21.641 --> 00:43:24.970
limiting it to one or two day ground shipping was sort of key for us that in our

734
00:43:24.971 --> 00:43:27.520
test that we never want to just go longer than that in the box.

735
00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:31.900
By November of 2015 about one year after I launched,

736
00:43:31.901 --> 00:43:36.040
we opened up a west coast distribution center and we moved out of our facilities

737
00:43:36.041 --> 00:43:37.870
into also a more proper place.

738
00:43:37.871 --> 00:43:41.790
It was a cold room that we were packing our product and cold.
Um,

739
00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:45.160
and so from both distribution centers in Boston and La,

740
00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:50.220
they were always add packed in a cold rooms and then packed into boxes with

741
00:43:50.741 --> 00:43:55.070
installation gel packs,
limiting it to one and two day ground shipping.
Uh,

742
00:43:55.090 --> 00:43:59.200
we then moved to our Boston facility in New York for broader reach and a bit

743
00:43:59.201 --> 00:44:00.800
more efficiency.
Uh,

744
00:44:00.850 --> 00:44:04.060
we've just opened up a third distribution center in Ohio and so now we have a

745
00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:05.530
hundred percent coverage in the content.

746
00:44:05.531 --> 00:44:08.080
So you asked with one or two day ground shipping,
uh,

747
00:44:08.081 --> 00:44:11.050
there are some customers that we need to do a two day air,

748
00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:14.380
which we don't want it to be doing it and we're moving to move that third

749
00:44:14.381 --> 00:44:18.610
facility to have the capacity to get everyone meals within one or two days from

750
00:44:18.611 --> 00:44:22.700
when they ship a with a truck rather than using an airplane.
Um,

751
00:44:23.410 --> 00:44:26.860
the downside to that is the requirement on installation.
Um,

752
00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:31.950
we have had some learnings and experiences where we had a thickness to our boxes

753
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.560
and just this summer we went through a problem where we had some insulation that

754
00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:42.360
was,
we needed to add more gel packs to keep it cold because the insulation was

755
00:44:42.361 --> 00:44:43.194
failing.

756
00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:46.740
So that was sort of a whole separate story with our supplier that caused me some

757
00:44:46.741 --> 00:44:49.380
gray hair on my head to add to what's there already.

758
00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:52.350
And putting more gel packs in.

759
00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:55.200
Men started to compromise the integrity of the box.
And so you'd,

760
00:44:55.201 --> 00:44:57.540
people would get boxes that were beat up in the box would,

761
00:44:57.570 --> 00:45:00.300
would compress under the weight of the of Gel packs.

762
00:45:00.301 --> 00:45:03.360
And the gel packs were melting faster cause there wasn't the installation.

763
00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:05.790
So it becomes sort of a snowball effect.

764
00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:09.450
And we were able to quickly shift to a thicker box and that issue is gone away

765
00:45:09.451 --> 00:45:12.660
and we changed the liners.
But you know,
and so it's a really,

766
00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:17.910
the amount of complexity that I think happens in the meal kit space is really

767
00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:23.990
pronounced and to get incredibly fresh and incredibly fragile produce.

768
00:45:24.151 --> 00:45:27.960
A lot of times,
especially in a plant based meal kit where we're not relying on,

769
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.990
you know,
chicken or beef or other animal protein as the source,

770
00:45:30.991 --> 00:45:32.730
we're really having to bulk up on,

771
00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:36.690
on great vegetables and grains that some of that stuff is really fragile and

772
00:45:36.691 --> 00:45:41.130
also hard to source.
So it can be complex if you are sourcing,
you know,

773
00:45:41.131 --> 00:45:42.390
a watermelon radish,

774
00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:47.680
well we had issues where the watermelon radish was too big and it was supposed

775
00:45:48.091 --> 00:45:52.350
to meet Spec but the suppliers couldn't get us the smaller water round radishes.

776
00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:55.260
Now you have a big watermelon radish,
it's gonna throw the flavors,

777
00:45:55.261 --> 00:45:59.160
then you have to go and cut the watermelon radish in half.
And that,
you know,

778
00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:02.430
that worked because there was stability to that product.

779
00:46:02.431 --> 00:46:06.210
And onion wouldn't hold up nearly as well,
if at all.
Um,
so there's,

780
00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:10.740
there's decisions that we have to make every single week sort of throughout the

781
00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:15.360
week based on what the supply chain enables us to access.
And you know,

782
00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:19.020
I think what blue aprons done to control a lot of the supply chain is brilliant

783
00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:23.370
because they should have sort of the best pick of the produce and suppliers are

784
00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:24.870
growing things just for them.

785
00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:28.710
So that should enable them to avoid some of those challenges that we face as a

786
00:46:28.711 --> 00:46:30.430
smaller company.
Um,

787
00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:35.280
but getting it to someone in a really fresh manner is certainly the most

788
00:46:35.281 --> 00:46:40.230
important piece.
And when our suppliers like a FedEx or on track deliver,

789
00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:42.510
sometimes they miss and you know,

790
00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:46.980
but we have to own that so we can't go back to the customer say,
sorry on track,

791
00:46:47.010 --> 00:46:48.000
messed up this week.

792
00:46:48.450 --> 00:46:51.270
We have to then take that and need to refund them or give them credit.
So it's,

793
00:46:51.271 --> 00:46:55.590
uh,
yeah,
it's challenging,
but I love it.
Thank you.

794
00:46:56.250 --> 00:46:57.083
Thank you.

795
00:46:59.290 --> 00:47:03.360
<v 3>Um,
so I have some of it of a related question on packaging's.
Sure.</v>

796
00:47:03.361 --> 00:47:07.540
One of the common criticisms of meal kits is that it involves a lot of packaging

797
00:47:07.541 --> 00:47:11.710
and that's one of the things that's given me pause about trying it out.
Yup.
Um,

798
00:47:11.711 --> 00:47:15.520
so I'm just curious like how do you think about environmental sustainability in

799
00:47:15.521 --> 00:47:19.690
your packaging?
And I work in finance.
I'm always curious about the numbers.

800
00:47:19.691 --> 00:47:23.200
Like do you know how much the impact of packaging and transport,

801
00:47:23.770 --> 00:47:27.850
how does that offset the environmental benefits accrued from actually eating a

802
00:47:27.851 --> 00:47:29.590
plant based diet?
Sure.

803
00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:35.170
<v 0>Yeah.
We're actually starting to study the,
that exact issue.
Um,</v>

804
00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:40.560
what I can tell you is we're very aware of the of the challenge with

805
00:47:41.201 --> 00:47:42.790
installation.
Uh,

806
00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:47.770
I'd say by and large is the single largest complaint against meal kits is how

807
00:47:47.771 --> 00:47:50.590
much packaging and insulation goes in to get the customer.

808
00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:54.580
They are relatively small amount of food as compared to the size of the box that

809
00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:56.480
is being shipped.
Um,

810
00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:02.700
we have moved over time from sort of more standard installation to recyclable

811
00:48:02.891 --> 00:48:04.660
installation.
Uh,

812
00:48:04.690 --> 00:48:09.340
we were were through the spring that we were using the first a hundred percent

813
00:48:09.341 --> 00:48:12.490
curbside recyclable installation.
Um,

814
00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:17.410
and we're now into,
we,
we then now use a,
um,

815
00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:21.040
a recycled installation that's made from water bottles that's been recycled down

816
00:48:21.041 --> 00:48:25.790
from that,
that is then further recyclable.
Um,
all of our boxes are recycled,

817
00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:28.390
bald,
the baggies,
the bottles,
everything can be recycled.

818
00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:32.710
So we do our best to minimize that impact.
And I think broadly speaking,

819
00:48:32.711 --> 00:48:36.790
the industry is aware of that and more and more companies are helping consumers

820
00:48:36.791 --> 00:48:40.920
get comfortable with that idea that you can at least recycle the product,
that,

821
00:48:41.050 --> 00:48:42.330
that is being shipped to you from the,

822
00:48:42.490 --> 00:48:46.750
the what's required to get you those fresh items.
Um,

823
00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:49.240
but it's,
you know,
as a plant based company,

824
00:48:49.241 --> 00:48:52.720
which has a big connection to environmental sustainability,

825
00:48:52.721 --> 00:48:53.920
it's incumbent upon us,

826
00:48:53.921 --> 00:48:57.730
I believe as a company to have the words match our actions or the actions match

827
00:48:57.731 --> 00:49:01.810
our words.
Uh,
so that we're continuing to innovate.
Um,

828
00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:05.470
I'm pleased with what we've accomplished in a relatively short period of time.

829
00:49:05.471 --> 00:49:08.950
I think the gel packs is a piece that we're looking at taking frozen water

830
00:49:08.951 --> 00:49:10.300
bottles and using that.

831
00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:14.950
So you put frozen water bottles into the packing and let that cool.

832
00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:18.760
The produce that is in there,
then you can drink your water bottles,

833
00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:19.720
recycled water bottle,

834
00:49:19.721 --> 00:49:23.700
and you've got really zero impact as compared to the gel packs that,
I mean,

835
00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:27.040
people have a little discomfort about having either squeeze those out or throw

836
00:49:27.041 --> 00:49:30.010
them away.
It feels like a lot,
especially if you order on a regular basis,

837
00:49:30.011 --> 00:49:33.940
they build up.
I feel like my God,
what am I doing with all these?
Um,
so it's,

838
00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:35.590
it's no doubt a challenge.
I think,
you know,

839
00:49:35.591 --> 00:49:40.210
if people factor in the gas that they're using to drive to the grocery store.

840
00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:44.830
And also you think about the amount of impact that grocers have with respect to

841
00:49:44.831 --> 00:49:48.370
receiving,
you know,
truckloads of groceries that come in.

842
00:49:48.371 --> 00:49:52.570
There's a massive amount of,
you know,
sort of violation,
if you will,

843
00:49:52.571 --> 00:49:56.100
that happens at the grocery level that I think people forget about and assign

844
00:49:56.110 --> 00:49:58.960
all of that to the meal kit.
And so it's,
you know,

845
00:49:59.110 --> 00:50:04.030
I think it's the reality that we have about,
uh,
the impact we make.

846
00:50:04.031 --> 00:50:08.410
But I think that there's also a relative falsehood that it's the carbon emission

847
00:50:08.411 --> 00:50:10.990
that happens from transportation that is so big,

848
00:50:11.290 --> 00:50:14.080
when in fact it's the animal agriculture that's even bigger than that.

849
00:50:14.590 --> 00:50:18.300
So hopefully we can move people in that direction.
Yeah.

850
00:50:19.490 --> 00:50:19.911
<v 3>Um,</v>

851
00:50:19.911 --> 00:50:24.911
so do you have any advice for young entrepreneurs and how did your time at Nyu

852
00:50:25.191 --> 00:50:27.770
stern an sales impact career?

853
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:34.130
<v 0>Yeah,
thanks for the question.
Um,
so if you're a young entrepreneur,</v>

854
00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:38.330
I would,
uh,
I'd build on what I said already about,
um,

855
00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:41.870
following Seth Goden and reading his teachings.

856
00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:46.340
I would drink up every single thing that you can on that.
Uh,

857
00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:51.080
and Guy Kawasaki is a great resource as well.
Gary Vee is a pretty,

858
00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:55.970
um,
he's,
he's out there with what he says.
He's got a particular style,

859
00:50:55.971 --> 00:50:59.450
but he's all about entrepreneurship as well.
Um,

860
00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:01.070
I think more than anything though,

861
00:51:01.071 --> 00:51:04.730
it's having the courage and confidence to take the leap and not wait for the

862
00:51:04.731 --> 00:51:07.790
perfect moment because there's never a better time than right now to start your

863
00:51:07.791 --> 00:51:09.860
company.
Uh,
what people have,

864
00:51:09.861 --> 00:51:13.580
the resources that are available today than was available last year or five

865
00:51:13.581 --> 00:51:16.790
years ago or 15 or 20 years ago,
certainly is incredible.

866
00:51:16.850 --> 00:51:20.090
And you don't need permission to start.
You just have to have the guts to do it.

867
00:51:20.570 --> 00:51:22.250
Um,
and you know,

868
00:51:22.251 --> 00:51:26.090
access to capital is so much easier today than it's ever been before.

869
00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:31.300
You can publish on your own.
You don't need permission to do that.
Um,

870
00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:35.390
and the economy is supportive of startups.

871
00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:38.930
And so I think the idea of being able to create,

872
00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:44.630
create a business and you know,
using tools like slack that enables you to be,

873
00:51:44.631 --> 00:51:48.620
you know,
uh,
disconnected from your people from a proximity perspective,

874
00:51:48.621 --> 00:51:52.760
but stay connected,
uh,
the tools that are available to build websites,
you know,

875
00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:55.820
rapid fashion,
uh,
the,

876
00:51:55.821 --> 00:51:58.300
the opportunities are right in front of you and it's,

877
00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:02.570
it feels great to try to make a difference and to test yourself every day with

878
00:52:02.571 --> 00:52:06.920
that and give yourself a challenge that is so different than working in

879
00:52:06.921 --> 00:52:11.000
corporate America with all due respect to corporate America where I spend a fair

880
00:52:11.001 --> 00:52:13.070
bit of my career.
Um,

881
00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:17.520
but it's great and once you get the bug,
you'll never go back.
Um,

882
00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:21.080
and I don't think I could ever work again in corporate America and never plants

883
00:52:21.081 --> 00:52:25.580
who,
um,
and I think for those young entrepreneurs that are thinking about that,

884
00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:26.540
uh,

885
00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:30.320
to do it and to just play the long game and know when you've got to quit that,

886
00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:33.740
uh,
if it's not working so that you have the chance to try the next thing and the

887
00:52:33.741 --> 00:52:34.760
next thing and the next thing.

888
00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:37.790
And hopefully you make some money along the way and you can then roll that into

889
00:52:37.791 --> 00:52:41.810
your next,
uh,
next approach.
You know,
Nyu was,
um,

890
00:52:42.410 --> 00:52:45.590
it was five years of a lot of pain.
It costs me a lot of money.

891
00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:48.620
It costs me a lot of my time.
The fact that I have an Mba,

892
00:52:48.890 --> 00:52:52.490
I don't think it really mattered.
I have to say,

893
00:52:52.491 --> 00:52:54.110
I wish I could think differently about it.

894
00:52:54.111 --> 00:52:56.750
I think those who go fulltime have a much different experience.

895
00:52:56.750 --> 00:53:01.220
I went part time and went from seven to 10:00 PM for classes most nights for

896
00:53:01.221 --> 00:53:01.910
five years.

897
00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:05.810
And that was a really draining and I don't think I had the best teachers at

898
00:53:05.811 --> 00:53:07.640
those hours.
Uh,

899
00:53:07.641 --> 00:53:11.420
so I think someone thinks about an MBA should do it full time and go all in.

900
00:53:11.421 --> 00:53:15.260
And instead of doing like me,
which was squeezing it in while I worked,
um,

901
00:53:15.530 --> 00:53:19.520
and sales is just a great tool to be able to know how to sell them.

902
00:53:19.521 --> 00:53:21.650
Whether you're selling a product or you're selling an idea,

903
00:53:22.130 --> 00:53:23.780
whether you're trying to convince your spouse,
you know,

904
00:53:23.781 --> 00:53:26.430
where to go on vacation or you know,
tell your kids what food to eat.

905
00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:29.730
It's all sales at the end of the day.
And so,
uh,

906
00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:34.360
being able to sell ice to Eskimos or anywhere in between,
uh,

907
00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:38.310
is a really important tool and a skill that I encouraged for anybody.

908
00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:44.960
<v 3>Then on a related note,
um,
aside from meal kit delivery services,</v>

909
00:53:44.961 --> 00:53:48.590
what other opportunities for entrepreneurship do you see in the plant based

910
00:53:48.591 --> 00:53:49.424
space?

911
00:53:51.370 --> 00:53:54.700
<v 0>So,
um,
you know,</v>

912
00:53:54.730 --> 00:53:59.560
there's plant based space is growing by leaps and bounds and it's projected to

913
00:53:59.561 --> 00:54:03.580
grow from about a $13 billion industry to $25 billion industry in the next five

914
00:54:03.581 --> 00:54:07.030
years.
Uh,
so there's a lot of growth there.
I think,
you know,

915
00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:10.600
product development is a huge area of,
of innovation,
um,

916
00:54:10.690 --> 00:54:14.050
to think about educating people with,
you know,

917
00:54:14.110 --> 00:54:18.880
different types of products that are plant based.
Um,
you know,
the,

918
00:54:19.450 --> 00:54:24.130
I think the area of education is,
is,
um,
is great opportunity,

919
00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:28.760
whether it's like teaching people how to cook,
plant based or um,
uh,

920
00:54:29.290 --> 00:54:33.040
even providing services to help people become more plant based and sort of be,

921
00:54:33.041 --> 00:54:36.880
someone's sort of chaperoned,
threw us through a process.
Um,

922
00:54:37.060 --> 00:54:41.710
there's probably interesting innovation opportunities there.
Uh,

923
00:54:41.830 --> 00:54:44.920
but I would also not incur,
you know,
it doesn't,

924
00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:47.440
you don't have to be an entrepreneur just in the plant based space.
I mean,

925
00:54:47.441 --> 00:54:50.350
the plant based space I think is really cool and I love what I'm doing and the

926
00:54:50.351 --> 00:54:54.730
difference that I make by being in a plant based space versus selling or trying

927
00:54:54.731 --> 00:54:57.400
to promote other things.
Um,

928
00:54:57.970 --> 00:55:00.340
but I would say if someone's interested in playing bass is a great thing is go

929
00:55:00.341 --> 00:55:04.420
do expo east or expo west.
Expo West is in Anaheim.

930
00:55:04.421 --> 00:55:07.800
Expo East is in Baltimore.
Those conferences happen twice a year.
It's,

931
00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:12.180
it will open your eyes up to the incredible,
uh,

932
00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:15.440
growth of the category and the number of products that are,
uh,

933
00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:19.490
servicing those people who care about health and wellness,
uh,

934
00:55:19.690 --> 00:55:23.230
through the foods and choices that they make.
So that'd be worth going to.

935
00:55:24.170 --> 00:55:28.780
Thank you.
One other question.
Oh,
no.

936
00:55:29.020 --> 00:55:31.000
Okay.
All right.
All right.
Okay.
Thanks so much.
