1
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.300
Thank you for having me and thank you so much for everyone for making the time

2
00:00:12.301 --> 00:00:14.400
both in the room and on the live stream.

3
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.600
So as Rachel said,
this is my book I wrote.

4
00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:22.770
It came out actually the same day as Rachel's Book.
Our books are twins.
Um,

5
00:00:22.771 --> 00:00:26.610
I like to think of them.
Um,
and I'm going to tell you about the book,

6
00:00:26.611 --> 00:00:28.500
the main concepts in the book.
But before I do that,

7
00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:31.650
I want you all to do something.
I want you all to think,

8
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.660
think about a time that you had a conflict with someone.
Maybe it was at work,

9
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.220
maybe it was your boss,

10
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.970
maybe it wasn't your parent or your spouse or your teenage kid.

11
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.830
And maybe it was this morning,
or maybe it was last week or maybe last month.

12
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.700
Now I want you to think about how that conflict made you feel.

13
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.400
And I want people to shout out just the one word.

14
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.930
What's the one word that describes how you felt?
Stressed.

15
00:00:57.931 --> 00:01:02.290
Frustrated.
Unheard.
Irate.

16
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.080
If I hear that right.
Angry.
Okay.
I tried to,

17
00:01:06.081 --> 00:01:10.020
to p beautify it up a little bit.
Irate.
Yeah.

18
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.560
Anything else dismissed?

19
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.900
Sad,
I did this talk once and someone said strangled.

20
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.930
And I was really concerned about how they handled conflict that their

21
00:01:21.931 --> 00:01:22.764
organization,

22
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.780
what I've never heard when I've asked people do this is energized,

23
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.870
excited,
invigorated,
respected.
Um,

24
00:01:30.871 --> 00:01:34.890
and that's because this is the natural human response when we get into a

25
00:01:34.891 --> 00:01:39.240
conflict.
Conflict is when we feel threatened,
our identity,
our resources,

26
00:01:39.241 --> 00:01:43.380
our needs we're having needs and wants that aren't being met and we have a

27
00:01:43.381 --> 00:01:45.780
natural struck stress response,
right?

28
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.020
So we ended up having our heart rate go up.

29
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.030
We have higher levels of stress.
Um,

30
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.360
we lose access to the prefrontal cortex.

31
00:01:54.361 --> 00:01:59.361
We go into what Dan Goldman calls a Mig hijack and we're just not making good

32
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.810
rational decisions.

33
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.070
Now I believe that it doesn't have to be that way.

34
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.530
I believe that organizations should in need to have disagreements and conflicts,

35
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.730
but most often they're handling in ways that are unprofessional and

36
00:02:14.731 --> 00:02:15.690
unproductive.

37
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.460
And that's because we don't have the skills to have productive disagreements.

38
00:02:20.461 --> 00:02:23.250
And more importantly,
we've gotten to this place,

39
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.810
both in our organizations but in our country,
certainly at large,

40
00:02:27.811 --> 00:02:31.020
that disagreement actually equals unkindness.

41
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.730
And this is something that's really detrimental to human interaction.

42
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.590
So I'm on a personal mission.

43
00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:41.340
Why I wrote this book is that I want people to think of conflict and

44
00:02:41.341 --> 00:02:43.860
disagreement as a normal,
healthy,

45
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.400
productive part of interacting with other human beings.

46
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.050
And when we disagree with compassion,
empathy and kindness,

47
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.740
it has lots of positive benefits.
What?

48
00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.610
But unfortunately what's happening is,
um,
the exact opposite.

49
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.870
People are becoming meaner to each other.
This is a chart,
um,

50
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.560
that comes from Chris Porath.
She wrote a book called mastering civility.

51
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.400
I highly recommend it.
She studies uncivil behavior at work.

52
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.170
What she's seen is that over the last 20 so or so years,

53
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.860
we've people are reporting more and more rudeness at work.

54
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.640
So this is a number of people who really support someone being rude to them at

55
00:03:24.641 --> 00:03:28.570
work in the last,
at least once in the last month,
right?

56
00:03:28.571 --> 00:03:32.950
So we're getting meaner to each other and this Tate has its costs.

57
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.670
So a night to 2008 study done by CPP,

58
00:03:36.671 --> 00:03:41.671
which is the people who create the Myers Briggs test have a study that showed

59
00:03:41.981 --> 00:03:46.981
that on average are spending 2.8 hours a week dealing with conflict at work.

60
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.150
Now that's a lot of time and I imagined since the study was done about 10 years

61
00:03:52.151 --> 00:03:53.860
ago that it's actually gotten worse.

62
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.430
And that same study equated this with $359 billion and paid hours.

63
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.590
It's even worse if you're a manager.

64
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.600
A study by the American Management Association,
um,

65
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.150
showed that the average manager is spending 18 to 26% of their time.

66
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.790
Now,
full disclosure,
this was a study done in 1976.
Um,

67
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.540
this is the study that's most cited around how much managerial time I would

68
00:04:19.541 --> 00:04:21.880
pause it and that we actually spend even more.

69
00:04:21.881 --> 00:04:26.080
And I've seen more recent surveys that show some managers report spending up to

70
00:04:26.081 --> 00:04:29.500
40% of their time dealing with complex.

71
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.500
This also leads to performance issues.

72
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.050
So 65%.

73
00:04:35.051 --> 00:04:40.051
A study by the bent pen behavioral corporation found that 65% of problems,

74
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.080
performance problems are linked to strained relationships.

75
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.580
So it's most often what's happening in between people that's causing these

76
00:04:48.581 --> 00:04:51.760
problems.
So we're being mean to each other.

77
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.510
It's costs taking up our time,
it's costing US money,

78
00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.100
it's leading to performance problems.
What are we to do now?

79
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.030
First and foremost,
we have to embrace conflict as not a negative.

80
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.630
If you said to me,
I work in a conflict free office,

81
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.010
I would say that sounds pleasant but probably not very productive,
right?

82
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:17.050
So we have to embrace conflict as a normal,
healthy part of organizations.
Now,

83
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.340
all of this,
um,
these stats that are just reported,

84
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.820
show that what have led to what Bill Fisher and William Ury who wrote getting

85
00:05:26.861 --> 00:05:27.261
to,
yes,

86
00:05:27.261 --> 00:05:31.060
they're the Harvard negotiation project said conflict as a growth industry.

87
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.530
This is a quote from their book.

88
00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.460
Now this is great news for me as a conflict expert.

89
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.640
This is bad news for the rest of the world,
right?

90
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.970
So what we need to think about is first,
like I said,

91
00:05:42.971 --> 00:05:44.800
embrace conflict as a normal,

92
00:05:44.801 --> 00:05:49.801
healthy part of interacting with people and think about the positive outcomes

93
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.340
that come from complex first and foremost.
More successful work outcomes.

94
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.490
If I see a project one way and you see it another and we have to discuss that

95
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:04.460
you know our different opinions to come to a solution it the chances are the

96
00:06:04.461 --> 00:06:06.410
worst outcome is going to be better,
right?

97
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.560
If marketing is pushing for one thing and sales is for another,

98
00:06:09.561 --> 00:06:14.390
that natural tension organizations is going to make the end product better even

99
00:06:14.391 --> 00:06:18.170
if it's slightly uncomfortable or very uncomfortable for the people in the

100
00:06:18.171 --> 00:06:22.310
process.
Second of all,
you have the opportunities to learn and grow.

101
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:27.610
The more that you are forced to think about your position to articulate why you

102
00:06:27.681 --> 00:06:29.330
disagree,
what your points are,

103
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.820
the more you're going to learn about what's important to you,

104
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.810
the more you are going to expand as a person.
Third,

105
00:06:35.811 --> 00:06:39.080
you're going to have improved relationships.
Now I have a 10 year old daughter.

106
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.050
She understands this intuitively.

107
00:06:42.051 --> 00:06:46.410
She came back from a sleepover a few weekends ago and told me,
uh,

108
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.820
she had the best time and I said,
great,
why did you have the best time?

109
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:52.310
And she said,
Sophie and I fought the entire night.

110
00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.590
We fought about what movie we're gonna Watch.

111
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.890
We thought about what time we should go to bed,
where we're going to sleep.

112
00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.380
I said,
that doesn't actually sound that fun.
She said,
no,
but now we're BFFs.

113
00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:04.760
Right?
So she understood.

114
00:07:04.761 --> 00:07:09.140
When you go through a tough situation with someone where you have to do all that

115
00:07:09.141 --> 00:07:12.060
negotiation,
you end up having a stronger bond.
And this,

116
00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:16.190
and the research shows this is true at work as well.
And lastly,

117
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.730
that leads to the last positive outcome that I'm going to talk about,

118
00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:21.110
which is job satisfaction.

119
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:23.960
So if you feel like you can disagree with your colleagues,

120
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.880
if you're not walking on egg shows,

121
00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:28.730
worried that a disagreement is gun going to come up,

122
00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:31.490
you're much more satisfied at work.

123
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.110
Now how do we get these positive outcomes?
That's what my book does.

124
00:07:36.111 --> 00:07:40.700
It takes research from neuroscience,
emotional intelligence,
experts,

125
00:07:40.701 --> 00:07:41.750
management,
science,

126
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:46.070
and makes it sort of boils it down to an a very practical,

127
00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:49.130
straightforward approach and to how to candle conflict.

128
00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:53.270
So what I want to share with you today from the book or some tools and concepts

129
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:58.040
that will hopefully make conflict less stressful for you and help you reap these

130
00:07:58.041 --> 00:07:59.990
positive outcomes that I just talked about.

131
00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:04.610
And that's because dealing with conflict is an essential skill in today's

132
00:08:04.611 --> 00:08:05.421
organizations.

133
00:08:05.421 --> 00:08:09.230
Just chatting with a few view at the beginning here before we got started,

134
00:08:09.231 --> 00:08:10.040
it's clear,

135
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:14.240
you all know that there are conflicts on the horizon or that you're experiencing

136
00:08:14.241 --> 00:08:17.420
complex in order to function in today's organizations,

137
00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.310
you must have these skills.

138
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:25.060
So the first concept I want to talk to you about is that most of us self select

139
00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:27.050
into one of two categories.

140
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.500
We either tend to avoid conflict or we tend to seek it.

141
00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.070
So avoiders and it's exactly how it sounds,
right?

142
00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.280
Avoiders are people who probably want to hide under the desk when the

143
00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:41.090
disagreement comes up that they really value harmony,

144
00:08:41.091 --> 00:08:44.090
they value relationships.
Anytime things get tense,

145
00:08:44.091 --> 00:08:47.990
they want to back away or placate,
they want things to go smoothly.

146
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:53.500
Seekers on the other hand are people who really lean into conflict when it comes

147
00:08:53.631 --> 00:08:54.020
up.

148
00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:58.310
They're the ones whose body language is perhaps a little more aggressive when,

149
00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:02.420
when things happen,
um,
in a meeting or um,
you know,

150
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:03.570
in the hallway with,

151
00:09:03.571 --> 00:09:08.571
with someone and oftentimes they care most about directness and honesty.

152
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.340
Now I self select as a seeker.

153
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:15.570
I was the kid on the playground that when a fight erupted,
I would scream,

154
00:09:15.571 --> 00:09:19.650
fight and try to get as many people to come observe what was happening,

155
00:09:19.651 --> 00:09:23.160
partly because I knew that I could then broker,
um,
you know,

156
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:26.460
the disagreement and see,
see if we could get to a solution.

157
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:31.470
But also because I find uncomfortable situations and fights.
Really interesting.

158
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:32.460
I have,

159
00:09:32.461 --> 00:09:37.260
I don't know if anyone's been listening to the new Esther Perel podcast.

160
00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.810
She's a couple's therapist.
Yeah.
So she's doing,

161
00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:45.020
she's somehow got couples to do live or recorded therapy sessions with her.

162
00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:50.210
Um,
my husband and I tried to listen to this together and my husband who is an

163
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:54.420
avoider at his core was so uncomfortable.
It was like,

164
00:09:54.421 --> 00:09:57.960
how can you listen to this?
I was like,
this is fascinating.

165
00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:02.700
I couldn't,
couldn't get enough of it.
I highly,
highly recommend it.

166
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:06.540
Even if you're an avoider would help you maybe do a little bit of aversion

167
00:10:06.541 --> 00:10:11.190
therapy there.
So,
quick question.
Yeah.
It's called,

168
00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:15.690
um,
where should we begin?
And it's actually,
I think it's just on audible now.

169
00:10:15.691 --> 00:10:20.340
It should be on iTunes,
but,
um,
so I just want to get a quick survey in the room,

170
00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:24.450
um,
of how many avoiders and secrets,
how many people think they're avoiders.

171
00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:29.260
Okay.
I would say about half the room.
And how many people think they're seekers?

172
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:34.180
Yeah.
About half.
And how many think they're both?
Yeah,

173
00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:35.990
right or neither.
Yeah.

174
00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:41.340
So that it's of course normal that we would sometimes seek and sometimes avoid.

175
00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:45.230
Right?
You might be an avoider with your boss and a secret with your mother,

176
00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.420
right?
You might be an avoider with your friends,

177
00:10:47.421 --> 00:10:51.760
but a seeker at work and that's what you want to,
um,

178
00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:55.520
that's what you want to do is be able to figure out when,

179
00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:59.210
which style is going to work for you and understand your default style.

180
00:10:59.211 --> 00:11:03.680
So if you have a style that you tend to avoid and every time a conflict comes
up,

181
00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.240
you're hiding under the table,

182
00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.970
you have to think about how can I compensate for that?

183
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:12.110
How can I make this a little bit more palatable to me?

184
00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.890
Or if you tend to seek and you notice that people around you are leaving the

185
00:11:15.891 --> 00:11:19.220
room or scared to interact with you,
right,

186
00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:21.980
then you need to figure out how do I compensate for that?

187
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:25.020
Now in order to,
um,

188
00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:30.950
have a rational approach to conflict,
right?
To make those good choices,

189
00:11:30.951 --> 00:11:33.320
to know what your style is and to compensate it,

190
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:38.590
it really helps to put a little bit of distance between you in the situation and

191
00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:42.200
to get out of what I was describing before as a mcdilla hijack where you don't

192
00:11:42.201 --> 00:11:45.890
have access to your prefrontal cortex in order to do that.

193
00:11:45.891 --> 00:11:49.250
What I recommend and what a lot of the book is about is how to analyze each

194
00:11:49.251 --> 00:11:52.930
conflict that you're in,
right?
So you want to take each,

195
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:56.260
there's four steps that I described in the book.
Number one,

196
00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:58.450
you want to understand your counterpart.

197
00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:03.340
Now we are naturally narcissistic and when we feel threatened,

198
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:07.660
we think about how we are suffering.
We think about what,
what's happening to us,

199
00:12:07.661 --> 00:12:09.700
what's our perspective on the situation.

200
00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:13.750
It is incredibly helpful to think about the other person.

201
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:17.080
What is it that they're going through?
Are they a seeker avoider?

202
00:12:17.081 --> 00:12:21.130
What could be causing this behavior?
Right?
Second,

203
00:12:21.131 --> 00:12:23.290
you want to identify the type of conflict.

204
00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.980
I talk to people about conflict all the time.
When people find out,

205
00:12:26.981 --> 00:12:28.690
I write this book,
they want it by wrote this book.

206
00:12:28.691 --> 00:12:32.140
They want to tell me about every fight they've had at work in the last week.

207
00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:37.380
Most people assume that the conflict there in is a relationship conflict,

208
00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.900
meaning that it's sort of personal issue between two people.

209
00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:44.620
They feel disrespected or someone has said something snarky.

210
00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:48.740
But most conflicts at work actually start as one of three.
Um,

211
00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:51.850
other types,
and I'll go over these.
Like I said,

212
00:12:51.851 --> 00:12:55.120
most of us assume that there's a relationship conflict going on,

213
00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:59.470
but more often than not,
it's actually starts as a task conflict.

214
00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:03.130
So this is a disagreement over the goal of a project or the objective,

215
00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:04.930
what you're trying to achieve.

216
00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:07.870
So I think the goal of a project is to increase revenue.

217
00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:11.380
You think it is to improve customer satisfaction,
right?

218
00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:14.500
The second is process.
So you,

219
00:13:14.501 --> 00:13:17.080
we may agree that the goal is to increase revenue,

220
00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:21.220
but I think we should do that by rolling out to our entire,
you know,

221
00:13:21.221 --> 00:13:24.820
group of markets at one time.
You think we should do pilot it first?

222
00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.850
So it's a disagreement over the how we're actually going to get there.

223
00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:28.961
And then last,

224
00:13:28.961 --> 00:13:33.400
there's complex over status or power who gets to make the call.

225
00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:35.270
And this is extremely common in,

226
00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:40.380
in flat organizations where there's con teams that are shaping and reshaping all

227
00:13:40.841 --> 00:13:43.720
the time.
Right now,
of course,

228
00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:48.610
conflicts rarely fall into one discrete category.
More often than not,

229
00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.670
they're actually a combination of these things.

230
00:13:51.671 --> 00:13:56.410
And what I see most often is something that starts as task or process quickly

231
00:13:56.411 --> 00:13:58.510
devolves into a personal conflict.

232
00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:01.690
So you and I are disagreeing over what the goal of the project is.

233
00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:03.400
I start sending you late nights,

234
00:14:03.401 --> 00:14:06.940
snarky emails and it quickly becomes a personal issue.

235
00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:12.010
Now,
the third step,
so,
so before when you enter a conflict,

236
00:14:12.011 --> 00:14:15.900
you want to ask yourself what type of conflict are you having?
Right?

237
00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.390
That is an important step because once you know that,

238
00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:24.310
you can begin to dig into how to actually solve it.

239
00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:26.380
Because if you assume it's a personal conflict,

240
00:14:26.381 --> 00:14:28.780
those are the hardest conflicts to actually resolve.

241
00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:32.020
But if you can actually solve the task or the process conflict,

242
00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.560
the personal stuff is going to be much more easy to resolve.

243
00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.680
So now the third step is to determine your goal.

244
00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:43.330
And I like to say if your goal in the situation is to prove that your

245
00:14:43.331 --> 00:14:46.210
counterpart wrong,
find another goal.

246
00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:49.180
Now that might feel good in the near term,
right?

247
00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:53.120
It might feel good to say I was right in this situation or you were wrong.

248
00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:57.950
Or what I hear most often these days is his behavior was unacceptable and until

249
00:14:57.951 --> 00:15:01.850
he accepts his behavior is unacceptable.
We can't move on,
right.
If that,

250
00:15:01.851 --> 00:15:04.550
if your goal is just to prove someone's behavior is unacceptable,

251
00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:08.600
you are not going to solve that conflict cause no one wants to admit that their

252
00:15:08.601 --> 00:15:12.170
behavior was unacceptable.
If you can actually decide,
okay,

253
00:15:12.171 --> 00:15:16.640
my goal here is to save this relationship or my goal is to get this project

254
00:15:16.641 --> 00:15:20.420
quickly as done as quickly as possible so I never have to work with this person

255
00:15:20.421 --> 00:15:25.340
again.
That's a goal that's going to help serve you much better.
Right?

256
00:15:25.341 --> 00:15:28.790
And that's a goal you're going to be able to achieve and that will lead to the

257
00:15:28.791 --> 00:15:30.740
fourth step,
which is to pick your option.

258
00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.130
Now in most US companies that I talk to,

259
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:39.290
they think of having a discussion about conflict as sitting down and hashing

260
00:15:39.291 --> 00:15:41.600
things out and that's the direct approach.

261
00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:46.180
But you actually have several other options for handling a conflict and you use

262
00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:50.720
them all the time and may not even know.
So number one,
you can do nothing.

263
00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.600
We do this all the time.
Jeanne Brett,

264
00:15:53.601 --> 00:15:57.350
who runs the dispute resolution center at Northwestern University calls this

265
00:15:57.351 --> 00:15:58.970
lumping it and we do this.

266
00:15:58.971 --> 00:16:03.590
You get this snarky email or someone raises their voice in a meeting or someone

267
00:16:03.591 --> 00:16:07.160
says something that's completely off base and undermines your authority and you

268
00:16:07.161 --> 00:16:10.670
just sort of ignore it and move on and it's a great option.

269
00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:13.990
It's a great option is particularly if you don't have much power in this

270
00:16:13.991 --> 00:16:14.824
situation,

271
00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:19.580
if you're dealing with someone who is unreasonable or if you realize making a

272
00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:23.570
big deal of it is going to make things worse rather than just move on.

273
00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:27.620
Now there's a caveat about the do nothing option.

274
00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:32.000
If you are an avoider and you're like,
oh,
I love the do nothing option,
I love,

275
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:33.440
I do that all the time.

276
00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:36.950
You need to check yourself because you're likely doing it because you're afraid

277
00:16:36.951 --> 00:16:40.100
to have some conversations,
some difficult conversations.

278
00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:45.610
The other caveat is doing nothing that going back to your desk and stewing and

279
00:16:46.041 --> 00:16:50.480
not getting your work done and gossiping with another friend about how awful

280
00:16:50.481 --> 00:16:54.230
that person is,
is not doing nothing that's actually doing something.

281
00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:56.570
So in order to exercise this option,

282
00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:01.720
you really have to be willing to let it go and truly let it go.

283
00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:05.720
Now,
of course you might try to do nothing and realize it's not working.

284
00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:06.740
You're losing sleep,

285
00:17:06.741 --> 00:17:10.310
you're having the conversation in your head on the car ride home,
right?

286
00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:13.490
But if if you're,
that's okay,

287
00:17:13.491 --> 00:17:17.330
you can then move to one of the other options.
There's no harm in that.

288
00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:23.120
Another option is to address it indirectly.
I often talk to organizations,

289
00:17:23.121 --> 00:17:25.790
particularly I noticed in financial service organizations,

290
00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:29.090
I bring this up and they're like,
oh yeah,
that's the passive aggressive option,

291
00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:29.630
right?

292
00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:32.360
That's where you would try to get your needs met without actually having to talk

293
00:17:32.361 --> 00:17:33.110
about it.

294
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:38.110
But this is a perfectly good option in situations where addressing it directly,

295
00:17:38.841 --> 00:17:42.350
again,
maybe you're dealing with it someone who's unreasonable or with an extreme

296
00:17:42.351 --> 00:17:43.370
conflict avoider.

297
00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:47.960
So talking to a third party who can maybe intervene on your behalf is completely

298
00:17:47.961 --> 00:17:48.794
appropriate.

299
00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:53.700
This is also an appropriate option and in cultures where saving face is really

300
00:17:53.701 --> 00:17:55.250
important.
As a,

301
00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:59.280
in a previous career as a management consultant and I was staffed on a project

302
00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:03.720
in Korea for four months and it was a,
with this Korean conglomerate,

303
00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:07.830
we had three different work streams for the project and at one point we came to

304
00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:11.880
an impasse with our Korean counterparts where they said,
okay,

305
00:18:11.881 --> 00:18:14.510
we really need to figure out which of these three workstreams we're going to

306
00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:19.410
prioritize it.
Things got really heated,
really tense and finally we,

307
00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:22.560
they said we're going to meet with the CEO and the COO is going to help us

308
00:18:22.561 --> 00:18:25.050
decide which of these we should prioritize.

309
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:28.440
Me and my American counterparts are like,
great,
let's get in the room,

310
00:18:28.441 --> 00:18:31.650
let's hash it out.
We have,
we know what we think should happen.

311
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:33.150
They know what they think should happen.

312
00:18:33.151 --> 00:18:38.100
We're going to be able to sort this all out together and we get in the room and

313
00:18:38.101 --> 00:18:43.101
the CEO starts telling this long story about the founding of the company and um,

314
00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:47.850
you know why it was all about the people in his family and providing for the

315
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.470
people who worked there.

316
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:53.520
And after about 20 minutes of course we're listening to all this through an

317
00:18:53.521 --> 00:18:57.030
interpreter and looking at the interpreter sort of confused like this is really

318
00:18:57.031 --> 00:18:57.691
what he's saying.

319
00:18:57.691 --> 00:18:59.970
Weren't we going to decide which work stream we're going to focus on?

320
00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:04.530
After about 20 minutes he ends the story and everyone gets up in the meeting,

321
00:19:04.531 --> 00:19:08.220
seems to be over and we walk out and my American counterparts in our standing

322
00:19:08.221 --> 00:19:10.350
and sitting room like what just happened?

323
00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:13.620
Like boy and our Korean or like did you not hear?

324
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:17.910
He told us were prior to prioritizing the HR work stream because it was all

325
00:19:17.911 --> 00:19:21.720
about people and he had used the metaphor and the story of the founding of the

326
00:19:21.721 --> 00:19:25.830
company to put us in direction without ever having to discuss the conflict we

327
00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:26.550
are having.

328
00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:31.550
And that was a very appropriate way to solve the conflict in that organization.

329
00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:35.820
And it worked because we had the direction we needed and we were able to,

330
00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:38.220
to move forward.
And that's again,
you,

331
00:19:38.221 --> 00:19:41.580
I've seen people do this very skillfully where they will tell,

332
00:19:41.581 --> 00:19:45.030
have a conflict with summer and rather say we're having a conflict,

333
00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:48.030
let's discuss what's going on.
They'll say,
you know,

334
00:19:48.031 --> 00:19:53.031
I once had a previous job with someone where we weren't getting along and I did

335
00:19:53.521 --> 00:19:55.020
this and he did this and it,

336
00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:59.340
and it's sort of just dropping hints of this may be a way we can move forward

337
00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:01.770
without directly addressing what's happening.

338
00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:07.330
Third is addressed directly.
We'll talk a lot about that and the rest of the,

339
00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:12.330
the talk about how to actually prepare for those difficult conversations and how

340
00:20:12.331 --> 00:20:16.230
to have them.
Um,
and the fourth option is to exit the relationship.

341
00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:19.890
Now this is what I call the last resort option.
Um,

342
00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:24.420
very difficult to do in most organizations,
often hard to get a new boss,

343
00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:27.210
often hard to get a new teammate.
Um,

344
00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:29.670
so really this is a last resort.

345
00:20:29.671 --> 00:20:32.730
If you've tried the other three options and it's not working,

346
00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:35.500
you may need to find,
um,
you know,

347
00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:38.430
a way to stop interacting with this person.

348
00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:42.390
I talked to someone whose story is featured in the book who eventually went

349
00:20:42.391 --> 00:20:44.970
after really difficult situation with her boss,

350
00:20:44.971 --> 00:20:49.240
eventually went to HR and was able to sell HR on getting her to report to

351
00:20:49.241 --> 00:20:53.920
someone else,
um,
without actually having to lay out everything that was going on.

352
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:57.550
So it takes a lot of skill in most organizations to make this happen,

353
00:20:57.551 --> 00:20:59.530
but I like to lay it out as an option.

354
00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:04.720
So those are the four steps that to analyze a complex.

355
00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:05.860
And this again,

356
00:21:05.861 --> 00:21:10.861
the point is to help you put distance between your reaction to the situation,

357
00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:15.040
which is likely going to be narcissistic and emotional,
right?

358
00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:17.710
And your reaction and your action.

359
00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:22.800
So the idea is to give yourself some space before you decide exactly what to do.

360
00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:27.220
Now I'm talking about this as if you have all the time in the world,
right?

361
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:30.610
As if you can say,
oh,
you know,
you just sent me an email,

362
00:21:30.611 --> 00:21:33.220
I'm going to take a half an hour to go through these four steps.

363
00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:38.490
More likely you'll need to buy yourself some time and in time pressured fast

364
00:21:39.191 --> 00:21:42.310
moving organizations.
This can be difficult and I acknowledge that,

365
00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:46.780
but there are ways that you can give yourself a little bit of space to do this

366
00:21:46.781 --> 00:21:47.350
work.

367
00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:50.590
Eventually you'll be able to do those four steps really quickly in your brain.

368
00:21:50.591 --> 00:21:54.010
It won't take a half an hour sitting down,
opening my book,
right?

369
00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:58.700
And looking through each step.
Um,
but in the moment in,

370
00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:02.660
when you're first getting used to this,
you really want to take the time,
um,

371
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:06.250
you need.
So first if someone is yelling,

372
00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:10.540
if things are really heated,
it is okay to walk away,
right?

373
00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:15.010
What you need to do is actually own the,
the need to do that.

374
00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:19.600
So you never want to say you're being unreasonable or you're screaming,

375
00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:21.760
I'm going to take some five minutes.

376
00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:27.030
People do not like to be assigned emotions or reactions instead of own it.

377
00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:31.540
I need a few minutes to think this through or I really need to calm down.

378
00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:36.190
Can I come back to you tomorrow or can I send you an email later?
Right?

379
00:22:36.191 --> 00:22:37.780
You can ask for a break.

380
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:41.950
So even if you've started the discussion and then you realize I'm not being

381
00:22:41.951 --> 00:22:46.640
rational here,
or he's not being rational here,
you can say,
you know what,

382
00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:49.390
again,
can I take five minutes and come back to you?

383
00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:53.530
Or can we take a walk around the building and talk about this later and find,

384
00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:57.760
find a way to give yourself the space you need.
And then lastly,

385
00:22:58.060 --> 00:22:59.080
don't hit send.

386
00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:04.440
I cannot tell you how many times an email completely implodes a conflict

387
00:23:05.771 --> 00:23:10.090
situation.
We cannot read tone on email.
There's amazing studies about this,
right?

388
00:23:10.091 --> 00:23:14.470
We can not read tone.
We assume the worst intention when we get,

389
00:23:14.471 --> 00:23:18.640
when we send an email,
we assume we're being completely clear,
transparent,

390
00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:21.220
and benevolent.
When we receive an email,

391
00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:25.900
we assume people are being completely unclear and route,
right?

392
00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:29.460
So Co emails,
a horrible place to have it.

393
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:33.580
Have a discussion or a tense conversation.
So,

394
00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:38.400
especially if you've written a really long email in response to someone who has

395
00:23:38.401 --> 00:23:40.900
sent you something that you are not happy about,

396
00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:45.620
don't hit send or delete the draft,
put it into a document,

397
00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:49.040
save it for later.
You know,
allow yourself to vent.

398
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:53.000
But really make sure that you're not engaging over email.

399
00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:58.190
Now how to prepare for the conversation.
So once you've decided,
okay,

400
00:23:58.191 --> 00:24:01.040
we are going to sit down,
I need to talk to this person,

401
00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:04.220
I need to stop by their desk.
How do you actually get ready?

402
00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:08.990
I talk about three different types of preparation,
mental,

403
00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:12.320
strategic and logistic.
So first,
mentally,

404
00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:17.810
if you are going into a conversation that you think is going to be difficult and

405
00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:22.790
uncomfortable,
guess what?
It is going to be difficult and uncomfortable.

406
00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:24.680
So you have to change your mindset.

407
00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:29.980
Think about if I went into this conversation with a positive attitude with

408
00:24:30.381 --> 00:24:34.940
thinking about something I could learn,
what am I actually curious about?
Right?

409
00:24:34.941 --> 00:24:39.020
What don't I know about my counterpart's perspective or the assumptions that

410
00:24:39.021 --> 00:24:42.530
she's made that I can learn in this conversation,
right?

411
00:24:42.531 --> 00:24:44.240
Instead of thinking about I have,
oh,

412
00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:47.210
I have to give this teammate of mine this really negative feedback.

413
00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:51.860
Think about I'm really doing tough work to help my teammate grow,

414
00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:55.730
right?
Really put a positive frame.
And this is not sugarcoating,
right?

415
00:24:55.731 --> 00:25:00.170
This is not,
you should,
it should be a genuinely positive,
um,

416
00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:04.010
you know,
take on the situation.
But it,
it,

417
00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:09.200
it helps so much to go into a conversation with a much more curious,

418
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:12.710
open attitude because you're going to project that to the other person.

419
00:25:12.711 --> 00:25:17.060
And so much about resolving conflict is about the energy you both bring to the

420
00:25:17.061 --> 00:25:20.300
conversation.
If you come in slump shoulders,

421
00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:22.910
really nervous about what's happening,
fidgeting,

422
00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:26.870
that's going to queue the person because of our natural instinct to mirror

423
00:25:26.871 --> 00:25:31.460
another person's behavior,
that's going to cause them to do the same.

424
00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:34.940
Second,
you want to take your counterpart's perspective.

425
00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:37.310
So hopefully you've done this when you analyze the conflict,

426
00:25:37.311 --> 00:25:39.800
but also think more deeply,
what is it,

427
00:25:39.801 --> 00:25:42.260
this person that is motivating this person?

428
00:25:42.261 --> 00:25:45.740
What could explain the way that they've reacted so far?

429
00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:49.370
And granted,
sometimes you might want to be,
well,

430
00:25:49.371 --> 00:25:53.660
he's just a passive aggressive jerk,
right?
If you come up with that explanation,

431
00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:57.380
tried to come up with three more,
could it be that he's under extreme pressure?

432
00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:59.720
Is he she afraid of losing her job?

433
00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:03.590
Is there something going on in this person's personal life that would better

434
00:26:03.591 --> 00:26:06.890
explain what's happening?
Lastly,
you want to vent,

435
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:09.620
so find your most trusted colleague,

436
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:13.910
some a friend outside the organization and just get it all out.

437
00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:17.330
Because if you have all of those negative thoughts and feelings about this

438
00:26:17.331 --> 00:26:21.380
person,
about the situation,
and you bring them into the conversation,

439
00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:25.250
again,
you're going to really make things uncomfortable and you're going to set

440
00:26:25.251 --> 00:26:29.210
yourself up for failure.
So instead,
if you can get that all out,

441
00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:32.270
say it to the person,
to this trusted person,

442
00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:37.160
then you'll be much more calm and collected when you go into the,
um,

443
00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:42.050
into the discussion.
Now strategically,
how do you get ready?
One,

444
00:26:42.051 --> 00:26:46.380
you want to plan your,
so think about what you'll say and what you won't say.

445
00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:50.100
What will be helpful to the conversation and what would be likely to take the

446
00:26:50.101 --> 00:26:52.530
person off.
You don't have to write it out.

447
00:26:52.531 --> 00:26:55.050
You don't have to know exactly everything you're going to say because remember

448
00:26:55.051 --> 00:26:58.860
you're in conversation with another person.
You cannot predict how they'll react,

449
00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:04.130
but have a good sense of what it main points you want to make and jot those

450
00:27:04.591 --> 00:27:07.020
down.
Have them ready,
mate.
Trust me.

451
00:27:07.021 --> 00:27:09.780
If someone comes into a tense conversation looking prepared,

452
00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:11.910
I am nothing but grateful,
right?

453
00:27:11.911 --> 00:27:14.850
No one's going to say like you wrote your main points down.

454
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.430
It's incredibly helpful to have those at your ready,

455
00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:20.130
especially if things start to get emotional.

456
00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:23.670
You also want to prepare for multiple scenarios,

457
00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:26.010
so think about what happens if I start to cry.

458
00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:29.430
What happens if he gets up and walks out of the room?

459
00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:33.510
What happens if we get interrupted and we only have 10 minutes,
right?

460
00:27:33.511 --> 00:27:37.020
To have this conversation,
how will I react?
And the goal again,

461
00:27:37.021 --> 00:27:41.550
is not to PR to map out everything you'll say and do in those situations,

462
00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:46.200
but it's to make sure that you feel prepared and that you don't get blindsided.

463
00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:48.270
So when something happens,
you think,
okay,

464
00:27:48.271 --> 00:27:53.250
I thought something similar like this through and I'm ready.
I'm ready for this,

465
00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:57.570
this unforeseen situation.
Now,
logistically,

466
00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:03.290
where and when you have this conversation really matters and people often ask me

467
00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:06.900
how soon after an incident do I want to have the conversation?

468
00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:09.690
And what I always say is as soon as possible,

469
00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:12.870
but when you're both ready to have it,
right?

470
00:28:12.871 --> 00:28:17.010
So you don't want to push forward a conversation if you're not feeling like

471
00:28:17.011 --> 00:28:20.610
you've done the right work,
that you're not in a good frame of mind.

472
00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:25.380
If you go into the conversation feeling hyped up uncomfortable again,

473
00:28:25.381 --> 00:28:27.330
it's going out.
Going to set the right tone.

474
00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:31.740
So choose a time after you've had time to calm down.

475
00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:37.040
Make sure you have more than enough time to have the discussion and then also

476
00:28:37.411 --> 00:28:41.130
choose a good place to have it.
I often say,

477
00:28:41.131 --> 00:28:46.080
especially if there's a status conflict going on that you want to,
um,
you know,

478
00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:50.590
not be on anyone's territory,
go outside,
take a walk.
Um,

479
00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:52.290
especially if you're dealing with a seeker,

480
00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:56.040
half the conversation in a public place where they'll be on their best behavior,

481
00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:57.930
less likely to yell,
right?

482
00:28:57.930 --> 00:29:02.250
If you know you're a seeker and you think that the comfort of conference room is

483
00:29:02.251 --> 00:29:05.280
going to make you misbehave,
take yourself outside,

484
00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:09.690
ask the person to meet you in an in a neutral spot,
right?

485
00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:11.970
So once you've gotten ready,

486
00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:15.090
let's talk about how you actually have a productive conversation.

487
00:29:15.091 --> 00:29:18.330
Once you're in the room or on the phone or however you're having this

488
00:29:18.331 --> 00:29:21.810
conversation.
First you want to frame your message.

489
00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:25.410
So there's three things you do to frame your message.
One,

490
00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:29.790
you talk about a shared goal that you both have something that you have in

491
00:29:29.791 --> 00:29:31.710
common.
So you might say,
you know,

492
00:29:31.711 --> 00:29:34.320
we both really care about getting this project on time,

493
00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:38.280
or we both really care that this project comes under budget.

494
00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:40.650
Whatever you shared goal you have,

495
00:29:40.651 --> 00:29:44.710
or we really care about what's best for the team.
Second,

496
00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:48.460
you want to identify the type of conflict so you don't have to use the words

497
00:29:48.461 --> 00:29:50.380
task,
process status,

498
00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:55.150
but make sure it's clear that this is not about personal issues.

499
00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:59.830
Talk about what's the underlying business cause or business issue that's

500
00:29:59.831 --> 00:30:03.250
happening there.
And that will help depersonalize the discussion.

501
00:30:03.850 --> 00:30:06.910
And then third,
you want to ask that person.

502
00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:09.490
Well you want to set a collaborative intent.

503
00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:12.100
You want to make sure the person knows that you're there,

504
00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:15.130
not to prove your point,
not to prove them wrong,

505
00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:19.330
but to actually work it out together.
So you might say,

506
00:30:19.331 --> 00:30:22.810
I'm really excited we're having this conversation because I had success in this

507
00:30:22.811 --> 00:30:25.420
situation.
It's gonna depend on us working together.

508
00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:30.840
Or you might do what Adam Galinsky at Columbia University has found really works

509
00:30:30.971 --> 00:30:32.140
and a lot of these situations,

510
00:30:32.141 --> 00:30:35.800
which is to ask for advice that will show that you're being collaborative.

511
00:30:35.801 --> 00:30:39.640
So it sounds a little bit like this.
You might say,
you know,
I'm,

512
00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:42.280
we both really care about getting this project done on time.

513
00:30:42.281 --> 00:30:44.320
I think what's really at is at issue is,

514
00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:47.860
is a process conflict about how we actually solve it.

515
00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:52.480
I'd love to get your advice on how we can work this through together and that

516
00:30:52.481 --> 00:30:55.060
really enlist the other person that shows them.

517
00:30:55.061 --> 00:30:56.980
I'm not here to just prove my point,

518
00:30:57.130 --> 00:31:01.090
but I'm here to work collaboratively with you.
Second,

519
00:31:01.091 --> 00:31:03.670
you want to manage your emotions.
As I mentioned,

520
00:31:03.671 --> 00:31:07.750
we have a natural human instinct to want to mere another's person's behavior.

521
00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:11.680
So if you're getting red in the face,
if your heart rate is rising,

522
00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:13.540
your breathing is getting faster,

523
00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:16.990
the other person is going to likely react in the same way.

524
00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:22.230
So what you want to do is use a lot of mindfulness techniques,
right?

525
00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:23.740
Focus on your breathing.

526
00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:27.370
Try to imagine that you're a fly on the wall and you're just observing the

527
00:31:27.371 --> 00:31:31.270
conversation and what's happening or you know,

528
00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:34.480
really narrate to yourself in your head.
Give,

529
00:31:34.481 --> 00:31:38.410
try to give yourself some distance from those emotions and narrate in your head

530
00:31:38.411 --> 00:31:39.960
what's happening that it's,

531
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.740
that'll take you out of your body reaction and the stress response and really

532
00:31:44.741 --> 00:31:48.970
ground you,
um,
in being there and being present.

533
00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:51.850
You can also use what a lot of mindfulness experts,

534
00:31:51.851 --> 00:31:56.020
there's Leah Weiss at Stanford has done a lot of interesting research about
this,

535
00:31:56.021 --> 00:31:57.160
which is called anchoring.

536
00:31:57.370 --> 00:31:59.770
And it's trying to sort of ground yourself in your body.

537
00:31:59.771 --> 00:32:03.220
So you're either putting your,
focusing on your feet,
touching the ground,

538
00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:06.940
your hand on the table,
anything again to get you,

539
00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:11.430
get yourself present in your body and out of those sort of rumination,
um,

540
00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:12.820
going on in your brain.

541
00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:18.790
Now your main job in any difficult conversation is to listen.

542
00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:23.350
And this is not because you're being altruistic or genuine,
genuine,

543
00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:26.980
generous to your counterpart.
This is because it is strategic.

544
00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:31.870
The more information you have about what the person's interests are and what

545
00:32:31.871 --> 00:32:34.210
they want out of the situation,

546
00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:38.620
the more likely are going to be able to propose a solution that meets both your

547
00:32:38.621 --> 00:32:42.800
needs and their needs.
So you want to ask a lot of questions,

548
00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:47.850
ask what made you think that?
What are the assumptions going into that?
Um,

549
00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:51.650
you know,
tell me more.
Tell me more.
As a fantastic phrase,

550
00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:55.880
especially when someone says something that you immediately want to react to

551
00:32:55.881 --> 00:33:00.440
negatively and say,
that's not true.
That's inappropriate.
Try saying,

552
00:33:00.441 --> 00:33:01.910
tell me more instead,

553
00:33:01.911 --> 00:33:06.020
because you're going to find out a lot more information rather than shutting the

554
00:33:06.021 --> 00:33:08.330
conversation down.
And lastly,

555
00:33:08.331 --> 00:33:12.350
you also want to make your viewpoint heard the avoiders of the world.

556
00:33:12.351 --> 00:33:16.520
We'll spend a lot of time listening if they've even managed to stay in the room,

557
00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:20.570
right?
But you also want to make sure that you get your viewpoint heard.

558
00:33:20.571 --> 00:33:24.560
And you might say to someone,
I really hear your perspective.

559
00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:26.870
Repeat back what they hear,
but then say,

560
00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:29.600
I would like to tell you my take on this situation,

561
00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:35.020
help transition there that you've gone from listening mode to talking mode.

562
00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:40.100
Help them understand you're about to make your point and it's important that you

563
00:33:40.101 --> 00:33:44.540
have.
Sometimes we assume people understand what our interests or needs are in a

564
00:33:44.541 --> 00:33:49.070
situation and very often they don't.
So making your viewpoint heard,

565
00:33:49.071 --> 00:33:51.440
make sure that your interests are on the table.

566
00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:54.410
Now in the process of doing all this,

567
00:33:54.411 --> 00:33:57.860
sometimes even actually in the process of analyzing the complex,

568
00:33:57.861 --> 00:34:00.420
sometimes a natural resolution,
um,

569
00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:03.650
it just sort of evolves in the conversation.

570
00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:08.480
And you'll notice a resolution because it has three hallmarks.

571
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:13.670
Number one,
it satisfies interests.
So it satisfies as many interests as possible.

572
00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:18.140
It has to meet some of yours and some of your counterparts.

573
00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:19.670
It doesn't have to meet all of them,

574
00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:22.580
but for it to be a resolution that's going to stick,

575
00:34:22.581 --> 00:34:24.560
that's going to keep the relationship intact.

576
00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:28.790
It has to meet at least some of each of yours.
Second,

577
00:34:28.791 --> 00:34:31.460
it has to be fair and reasonable.
Now,

578
00:34:31.461 --> 00:34:36.320
what's fair to one person and reasonable to another is very different,
right?

579
00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:38.210
Those are very subjective terms.

580
00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:42.070
So you might think about how would this be,
um,

581
00:34:42.410 --> 00:34:46.100
observed or how would this be interpreted by other people?

582
00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:49.280
So if we had to write this agreement,
the disagreement that happened,

583
00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:51.470
the resolution we came to and we had,
does,
you know,

584
00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:55.220
distributed to everyone on our team or organization,

585
00:34:55.370 --> 00:35:00.170
what everyone look at them and say,
wow,
we really got the deal in that situation.

586
00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:03.770
Or would they think,
oh,
that's fair and reasonable.
Right?

587
00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:08.000
And you might even evoke those words in your discussion of a resolution.

588
00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:10.850
You might say,
I understand why you're proposing that,

589
00:35:10.851 --> 00:35:13.430
but I can't imagine having to pitch that to my boss.

590
00:35:13.431 --> 00:35:16.100
I think my boss would not think that's reasonable.
Right?

591
00:35:16.101 --> 00:35:20.360
So bring in sort of third party perspectives to establish what,

592
00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:24.560
what's fair and reasonable.
And lastly,
it has to leave the relationship intact.

593
00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:29.600
So if you have gone through all of this and you come to a resolution but you

594
00:35:29.601 --> 00:35:31.040
hate each other's guts,

595
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:34.730
that's not going to give you all those positive benefits that I talked about at

596
00:35:34.731 --> 00:35:37.320
the beginning.
You're not going to have a stronger relationship,

597
00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:40.110
you're not going to be happy to come to work,
right?

598
00:35:40.111 --> 00:35:42.820
So it has to make sure that the relationship stays intact.

599
00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:46.350
And there's a whole chapter in the book about how to repair the relationship

600
00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:49.680
after a conflict.
So you might want to check that out as well.

601
00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:54.900
So how do you get to that resolution when you're having the conversation?

602
00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:59.940
A couple things.
One,
be creative.
So rather than saying,

603
00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:03.750
I believe we should do this,
and your your counterpart come and sit back and say,

604
00:36:03.751 --> 00:36:07.620
no,
I think we should do this.
Try to build on each other's ideas.

605
00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:10.320
So if your counterpart throws out a potential resolution,

606
00:36:10.321 --> 00:36:14.640
say yes and I think we could also do this.
Build on it.

607
00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:16.770
Try to create more options,

608
00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:19.710
even throwing out options that you don't think we'll really work,

609
00:36:19.711 --> 00:36:22.860
because that's going to give you more interest in information about their

610
00:36:22.861 --> 00:36:23.331
interest.

611
00:36:23.331 --> 00:36:27.870
Because if you throw out something that's completely wackadoodle right,

612
00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:30.630
they're going to say,
that would never work because of this and this and this.

613
00:36:30.631 --> 00:36:35.310
And then you get more information about what matters to them and what they care

614
00:36:35.311 --> 00:36:38.340
about.
You also want to collaborate this.

615
00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:42.090
You cannot just criticize each other's ideas.

616
00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:46.130
Think about what can we propose together?
What information,

617
00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:47.760
additional information do we need?

618
00:36:47.761 --> 00:36:51.510
What other stakeholders do we need to get interest from?
Right?

619
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:53.670
Work on it together.

620
00:36:53.671 --> 00:36:56.580
You want to make sure that it feels like you're on the right side of the table

621
00:36:56.581 --> 00:37:00.810
together,
not on opposite opposite sides.
And then lastly,

622
00:37:00.811 --> 00:37:05.640
consider what you have to offer.
So oftentimes in in a difficult conversation,

623
00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:09.930
we are trying to sort out what each person can give.

624
00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:13.890
If you're asking your counterpart to give up something really important,

625
00:37:13.891 --> 00:37:16.440
some interest that's really,
that really matters to them.

626
00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:19.860
Consider what you have to offer in return.
Maybe it's on,

627
00:37:19.861 --> 00:37:23.700
it's something you can help out on another project at another time.
You know,

628
00:37:23.701 --> 00:37:27.630
maybe,
um,
you know,
you can do them a favor down the road,

629
00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:31.140
whatever it is that's going to in Volk,

630
00:37:31.141 --> 00:37:33.180
that's sort of natural law of reciprocity.

631
00:37:33.181 --> 00:37:36.360
They're going to be more likely to be willing to give if you've offered

632
00:37:36.361 --> 00:37:37.194
something up.

633
00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:42.630
So of course I'm talking about this again as if you have all the time in the

634
00:37:42.631 --> 00:37:43.290
world,

635
00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:48.290
but most of us in time pressured organizations are dealing with conflicts.

636
00:37:48.361 --> 00:37:51.240
That happened very quickly.
Something comes up in a meeting,

637
00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:53.820
something needs to be decided today,
right?

638
00:37:53.821 --> 00:37:56.850
We need to tell our bosses how this is going to be resolved.

639
00:37:56.851 --> 00:38:01.590
So I just want to give you a few points of what you can do on the fly and then

640
00:38:01.591 --> 00:38:05.820
I'll,
I'll take you some of your questions.
So first know your type.
No.

641
00:38:05.821 --> 00:38:08.250
Whether you tend to seek or whether you avoid,

642
00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:12.330
that's going to give you really important information when you start to react to

643
00:38:12.331 --> 00:38:13.470
conflicts that come up.

644
00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:17.400
So if you tend to be an avoider and something happens in a meeting,

645
00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:21.840
you'll recognize,
okay,
this is how I always react in these situations.

646
00:38:21.841 --> 00:38:25.980
I need to watch myself.
No.
What types?

647
00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:28.590
The four types of conflict and name them.
Again,

648
00:38:28.591 --> 00:38:31.980
you don't have to use the terms task,
process status,

649
00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:36.730
but really try to depersonalize what's happening because when someone disagrees

650
00:38:36.731 --> 00:38:40.420
with you,
as I've mentioned,
we start to think of that.
It's an unkind,

651
00:38:40.421 --> 00:38:44.050
that person doesn't respect me.
They don't think I'm qualified to be here,

652
00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:48.340
they don't think I'm good at my job.
Right?
And if you can really focus on,

653
00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:51.520
actually we're disagreeing over how to get this project done,

654
00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:55.570
it's going to help take some of that emotion in the,
in the personality,

655
00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:59.980
out of the situation.
Make smart choices about your option.

656
00:38:59.981 --> 00:39:03.820
Don't just default to hashing it out or doing nothing.

657
00:39:03.970 --> 00:39:08.290
Really think through,
okay of these four options,
which is the best here,

658
00:39:08.291 --> 00:39:11.950
and be ready to pivot if it doesn't,
if one option is not working,

659
00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:13.300
be willing to move,

660
00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:17.230
move to another and of course control your emotions.

661
00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:18.820
You want to make sure,

662
00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:23.740
I cannot tell you how many conversations I've seen completely go off the rails

663
00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:28.090
because someone starts to raise their voice or it gets red in the face and it

664
00:39:28.091 --> 00:39:32.710
just causes so much tension and discomfort.
The more you can be calm,

665
00:39:32.711 --> 00:39:37.570
cool and collected,
even if the other person isn't the much more,

666
00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:42.490
you're going to set that conversation on a path to success and you also,

667
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:46.660
it does not matter the content of the conversation.

668
00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:51.670
The person who feels in control of their emotions is most likely the person

669
00:39:51.671 --> 00:39:53.500
who's going to get what they want out of the situation.

670
00:39:53.501 --> 00:39:57.640
It's what I observe all of the time when I'm doing coaching or consulting,

671
00:39:57.790 --> 00:40:02.080
the people who feel in control and feel like they're making rational decisions

672
00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:05.920
always have the upper hand.
So I'm going to take some questions.

673
00:40:05.921 --> 00:40:09.790
If I leave you with one thing today,
I really want you to remember this,

674
00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:14.890
which is that it is it,
it is your job to disagree with people.

675
00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:17.950
It is your job to have opinions that differ from people.

676
00:40:17.951 --> 00:40:22.900
It is what makes work good and what makes it sort of fun to be at.

677
00:40:22.901 --> 00:40:27.280
So do not think of disagreement as unkindness is actually a kind thing to do if

678
00:40:27.281 --> 00:40:30.610
you do it the right way.
So thank you all so much for having me.

679
00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:33.873
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

680
00:40:35.330 --> 00:40:38.720
<v 4>Oh,
that was really good.
Thank you.
And we'll take questions.</v>

681
00:40:38.721 --> 00:40:41.540
So who has a question?
I'm going to go over here and

682
00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:47.590
thank you.
Those kinds of frameworks are really helpful to me,

683
00:40:47.591 --> 00:40:49.450
so I appreciate that.
Sure.
Um,

684
00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:54.480
sometimes conflict arises because of the processes in a large org and a portion

685
00:40:55.661 --> 00:40:59.590
of that org feels dismissed or diminished because of it in those complex happen

686
00:40:59.591 --> 00:41:00.424
over time.

687
00:41:00.490 --> 00:41:04.360
I'm curious about how we translate these kinds of one on one experiences to

688
00:41:04.361 --> 00:41:06.250
those larger kind of conversations?

689
00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:08.810
<v 0>Yeah,
so a couple things.</v>

690
00:41:08.811 --> 00:41:12.830
One of which is we all work in organizations where we don't have a ton of

691
00:41:12.831 --> 00:41:15.680
control over things happen,
how things happen.

692
00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:20.450
So what I tell people is focus on what you can control.

693
00:41:20.451 --> 00:41:24.920
It can be really easy to think about the larger cultural issues or the larger

694
00:41:24.921 --> 00:41:27.470
process issues and really focus on those.

695
00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:30.410
But if you are powerless to change those,

696
00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:34.460
you're going to feel nothing but you know,
sort of depressed and,

697
00:41:34.461 --> 00:41:37.340
and you know,
have sort of a lack of agency.

698
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:41.810
So really focus on the interactions and the human to human.

699
00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:45.800
I think these frameworks definitely apply at a larger level though.

700
00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:48.800
So let's say your department is,
you know,

701
00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:51.830
interacting with another department that tends to feel dismissed.

702
00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:55.220
You can really think about how,
you know,

703
00:41:55.280 --> 00:42:00.280
can we really focus on what the actual conflict is if they come in with a sort

704
00:42:00.501 --> 00:42:03.710
of a man down kind of an attitude,

705
00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:06.740
how do we really focus on what we're trying to achieve?

706
00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:11.240
Not that interpersonal issue.
Ultimately at the end of the day,

707
00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:13.970
all of this gets played out in a one to one

708
00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:18.200
or one to many,
um,
interaction.

709
00:42:18.290 --> 00:42:23.090
So really focus on how you can sort of compensate or undo some of those myths

710
00:42:23.091 --> 00:42:25.160
are some of those,
um,
you know,

711
00:42:25.161 --> 00:42:29.810
predispositions in the interaction and oftentimes that can sort of set,

712
00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:32.300
there's a Annie Mckee who wrote a great book,

713
00:42:32.301 --> 00:42:34.130
you guys should have her actually called,

714
00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:38.750
how to be happy at work and she talks about microcode cultures.

715
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:42.650
So we're all subject to the larger culture of our organization or our department

716
00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:43.663
or our team.

717
00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:47.810
But what she's observed is that people create microcultures and might just start

718
00:42:47.811 --> 00:42:52.250
with two people or might start with a segment of a team where you start

719
00:42:52.251 --> 00:42:55.880
interacting the way you wish people around you are in interacting.

720
00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.290
And it starts to set the behavior,
not necessarily sometimes it,

721
00:43:00.291 --> 00:43:03.680
it will impact the broader organization,
but more importantly,

722
00:43:03.681 --> 00:43:08.681
it just protects you in that moment of I have this safety of this micro culture

723
00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:14.210
in which I know I can behave and live my values and be happy at work.

724
00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:16.940
Great.
Another question.

725
00:43:20.350 --> 00:43:23.880
<v 5>I had two questions,
but
you have to care of</v>

726
00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:32.270
larger scales and just two people having college.
Um,
the,

727
00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:35.730
the probably easier shorter one question is the,

728
00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:39.480
would you describe it as a process?
Uh,
conflict?

729
00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:43.830
I was hearing more kind of a have process.
I at task,

730
00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:47.330
which he described as a task,
a conflict.
I was hearing that more.

731
00:43:47.331 --> 00:43:49.620
It's kind of differences of objectives people have.

732
00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:51.120
Is that a fair characteristic?

733
00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:52.080
<v 0>Yeah,
absolutely.</v>

734
00:43:52.081 --> 00:43:55.860
So it might be we disagree about what the goal is or it might be our goals are

735
00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:59.340
we have goals and they conflict.
Yup.
Yup.
Okay.
Yup.

736
00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:04.410
And I think so that those tensions in our organization are really good to have.

737
00:44:04.411 --> 00:44:07.830
Right?
It's okay when when,
um,

738
00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:11.280
departments or teams have different goals that conflict,

739
00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:16.520
it's how you actually resolve the conflict or how you resolve the misalignment

740
00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:19.710
that matters.
And that's the opportunity.

741
00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:24.860
I sometimes say that managers have a responsibility to create tensions on an

742
00:44:25.171 --> 00:44:27.140
organization.
If everyone in your,

743
00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:32.010
in your team sees eye to eye and it really aligned,
you're not your job.

744
00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:35.130
Right?
People need to bring in diverse perspectives.

745
00:44:35.131 --> 00:44:36.600
They need to see things differently.

746
00:44:36.601 --> 00:44:40.410
They need to disagree with the strategies or the goals because that's going to

747
00:44:40.411 --> 00:44:42.810
make the work much more robust.

748
00:44:43.970 --> 00:44:44.620
<v 2>Okay,</v>

749
00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:46.450
<v 0>great.
Next question.</v>

750
00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:55.740
Uh,
this might be a little bit of a difficult question,

751
00:44:55.741 --> 00:44:59.040
but I didn't know if you had any advice you can give to women who there's kind

752
00:44:59.041 --> 00:45:03.010
of that existing societal expectation that we're supposed to be agreeable.
Yeah,

753
00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:08.130
so I could do a whole nother talk about the gender issues around conflict.

754
00:45:08.131 --> 00:45:10.870
There's some great research about,
um,

755
00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:14.990
women in negotiation and exactly the societal expectations.

756
00:45:14.991 --> 00:45:17.630
So the research was done by,
um,

757
00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:22.530
Hannah Reilly Bowles who was at Harvard Kennedy School and it shows that women

758
00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:24.960
tend not to negotiate for themselves,

759
00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:28.080
not because they don't know how to or don't have the skills,

760
00:45:28.081 --> 00:45:30.150
but because they are penalized for doing so.

761
00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:35.420
So both men and women who witness a woman negotiate are far more likely to say

762
00:45:36.751 --> 00:45:38.280
they don't want to work with her.

763
00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:42.780
Then if they see a men man do the same exact kind of negotiation.

764
00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:47.970
Now I'm a big believer and you control what you can control.

765
00:45:47.970 --> 00:45:52.950
If I knew how to change that societal expectation,
um,
I would do that.

766
00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:55.500
That's what I would be spending my life doing.
Um,

767
00:45:55.530 --> 00:45:58.440
but since we cannot control that,

768
00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:02.700
it's you have to think a little bit about how do I deal with,
um,

769
00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:07.050
deal with that expectation and that risk that if I do negotiate,

770
00:46:07.051 --> 00:46:10.320
the answer is not to not negotiate.
Um,

771
00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:12.960
what Hannah and also a woman named Debbie Cole,

772
00:46:12.961 --> 00:46:16.980
but baths and advise as to what they call the eye we strategy.

773
00:46:16.981 --> 00:46:20.490
So instead of negotiating for I your d or yourself,

774
00:46:20.491 --> 00:46:22.190
your negotiation for we.

775
00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:27.440
So how is what you want best for the organization or how is what you want best

776
00:46:27.871 --> 00:46:29.400
for the team?
Um,

777
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:34.430
the classic example Hannah uses is Sheryl Sandberg when she negotiated her

778
00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:39.870
salary with Mark Zuckerberg said before the salary negotiation said,

779
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:43.770
as your COO,
you want me to be good at negotiation?

780
00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:47.610
So I'm going to show you right now how good I am at negotiation.
Right?

781
00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:50.610
And she was negotiating for herself,

782
00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:54.900
but she pitched it as I'm negotiating on behalf of you.
Right?

783
00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:59.430
It's an incredibly tire,
some mental gymnastics to have to do.

784
00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:01.680
But it's the reality that we live in.

785
00:47:01.830 --> 00:47:05.940
And I do think that strategy of how is this best for the organization?

786
00:47:05.941 --> 00:47:07.350
How is this best for my team?

787
00:47:07.351 --> 00:47:10.290
That's another way women tend to get away when negotiation is,

788
00:47:10.291 --> 00:47:14.940
my team really needs this.
Um,
you know,
again,

789
00:47:14.941 --> 00:47:16.980
tiresome.
Wish we didn't have to do it,

790
00:47:16.981 --> 00:47:19.890
but it is an in an effective way to get around that.

791
00:47:23.810 --> 00:47:25.100
Any other questions

792
00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:29.863
on,
over?

793
00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:35.980
<v 4>So during a very tense moment,</v>

794
00:47:35.981 --> 00:47:39.190
what kind of emotions do you suggest portraying?

795
00:47:40.610 --> 00:47:43.490
<v 0>So well,
okay,
that's uh,
that's a difficult,</v>

796
00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:45.740
actually find that more difficult than the gender question.

797
00:47:45.741 --> 00:47:50.330
Partly because what you want to portray is authentic.

798
00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:55.010
So if you're trying to portray that you're calm and collected and you're

799
00:47:55.011 --> 00:47:59.570
actually fidgeting,
that is much worse than actually portraying your anger,

800
00:47:59.750 --> 00:48:00.050
right?

801
00:48:00.050 --> 00:48:05.050
Because what people interpret is a dissonance between what's happening.

802
00:48:05.091 --> 00:48:09.020
And that dissonance is so confusing to people and it makes things really,

803
00:48:09.021 --> 00:48:13.220
really difficult for it to actually have a conversation.
So first and foremost,

804
00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:16.730
portray the authentic emotion you're having or the,

805
00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:20.720
or what you can truly portray as,
as real.

806
00:48:20.721 --> 00:48:22.700
So you're not communicating that,

807
00:48:22.730 --> 00:48:27.590
that disagreement with your body language and your emotions.
That said,

808
00:48:27.591 --> 00:48:30.050
I do think that,
um,

809
00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:35.090
it's okay sometimes to express anger in a,
in a,
uh,
in a disagreement.

810
00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:37.520
I had,
um,
you know,

811
00:48:37.521 --> 00:48:41.570
a colleague who told had a really difficult situation with a colleague.

812
00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:46.640
She had been really working hard to stay calm in these conversations.
Um,

813
00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:50.390
every time he said something,
which she thought was completely off base,
you know,

814
00:48:50.391 --> 00:48:52.640
she sort of did the deep breathing,
the anchoring,

815
00:48:52.641 --> 00:48:56.810
and she was calm and she lost it one time and yelled and he stopped after the

816
00:48:56.811 --> 00:49:01.400
meeting and said,
I never knew that I was frustrating you.
And I was like,
oh no.

817
00:49:01.401 --> 00:49:03.800
Like she had spent all this time remaining calm and he,

818
00:49:03.801 --> 00:49:08.630
she had actually never conveyed to him that he was driving her crazy.

819
00:49:08.930 --> 00:49:10.370
And so,
um,

820
00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:15.320
there are appropriate moments that the difference between what she did at that

821
00:49:15.321 --> 00:49:19.160
moment and what most of us tend to do is that she had control.

822
00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:23.570
So it wasn't a moment where she felt like she felt embarrassed that she had

823
00:49:23.571 --> 00:49:26.180
yelled.
She had really reached a point where she was like,

824
00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:30.830
I have no choice but to yell right now and to make clear how I feel.

825
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:33.920
And it was a rational decision for her to make.

826
00:49:33.921 --> 00:49:36.920
So portray to things that are authentic,

827
00:49:37.070 --> 00:49:39.020
be willing to portray negative emotions,

828
00:49:39.021 --> 00:49:43.940
especially if you feel like your positions not being heard for the most part,

829
00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:48.260
being calm is,
is great,
but only if you genuinely feel it.

830
00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:56.130
<v 4>The question's about smiling.
What do you do that so tell,
um,</v>

831
00:49:56.820 --> 00:49:59.400
is is the question,
should you not smile?

832
00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:04.880
Well I guess cause you said disagreement is not unkindness I'm just wondering if

833
00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:09.950
I was trying to project more warmth than empathy through smiling is either

834
00:50:10.141 --> 00:50:14.850
helpful or unhelpful because potentially that could also cause some dissonance.

835
00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:15.600
Yes.

836
00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:17.280
<v 0>Great.
So exactly that.</v>

837
00:50:17.281 --> 00:50:22.281
And I think that that's a great question because oftentimes when I'm helping

838
00:50:23.071 --> 00:50:27.650
with a mediation,
what I see happen is people will,

839
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:28.670
you know,

840
00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:32.690
say this happens all the time where people will have frame their message,

841
00:50:32.691 --> 00:50:35.180
they're ready for the conversation and then they tried to spread their

842
00:50:35.181 --> 00:50:38.630
discomfort over like 2000 word monologue to start it.
And it's like,

843
00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:40.820
what's happening here?
Right?
So they portray,

844
00:50:40.821 --> 00:50:43.460
I'm not feeling comfortable with this.
They portray I,

845
00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:47.660
this is going to be a really tense,
difficult conversation.
What you want,

846
00:50:47.661 --> 00:50:50.810
because disagreement shouldn't be unkind.

847
00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:55.250
What you want to portray is I am comfortable with this situation.

848
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:58.820
I feel like it's okay to have this conversation smiling.

849
00:50:58.821 --> 00:51:03.710
If you feel good about it and you sometimes you have to help people interpret or

850
00:51:03.711 --> 00:51:08.270
not.
We always think we're much more transparent than we are.
So in this,

851
00:51:08.271 --> 00:51:10.940
I say this around crying,
especially if you cry at work,

852
00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:12.680
people are going to just think you're sad.

853
00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:15.500
But people cry for all sorts of reasons.
They cry because they're mad.

854
00:51:15.501 --> 00:51:16.670
They cry cards,
they're frustrated.

855
00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:20.240
So if you're smiling or if you're crying or if you're doing something that's

856
00:51:20.330 --> 00:51:24.140
that,
you can tell your,
the other person's not interpreting.
You can say,
you know,

857
00:51:24.141 --> 00:51:27.590
I'm smiling because I really feel like this is an opportunity for us to resolve

858
00:51:27.591 --> 00:51:32.030
this disagreement and productive way.
Right?
So really narrate what,

859
00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:33.920
why you're doing what you're doing,

860
00:51:33.921 --> 00:51:38.060
especially if you're interpreting a little bit of of discomfort.

861
00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:41.630
But in that regard,
yes.
Smiling is great.
If you can portray,

862
00:51:41.870 --> 00:51:45.440
I'm not uncomfortable with this conversation.
I'm glad we're having it.

863
00:51:45.830 --> 00:51:50.110
That's a great way to set up the conversation for success.
Amy,

864
00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:51.410
thank you so much.
Thank you.

865
00:51:51.411 --> 00:51:55.200
Thank [inaudible].
