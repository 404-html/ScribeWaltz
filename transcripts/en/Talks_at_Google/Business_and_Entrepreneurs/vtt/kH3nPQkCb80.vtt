1
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.570
Well,
thanks.
Thanks for having us today.

2
00:00:07.571 --> 00:00:11.350
We're actually excited to be here and appreciate the opportunity to come in and

3
00:00:11.351 --> 00:00:15.580
tell you a little bit.
Um,
what the five interest Colorado is about.

4
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.620
Um,
you know,

5
00:00:17.621 --> 00:00:22.621
I think the place to start is entrepreneurship and you might think to yourself,

6
00:00:22.961 --> 00:00:27.070
why are we talking about entrepreneurship with work that you do in prisons?

7
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.280
And our belief is,

8
00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:33.520
is that entrepreneurship is actually one of the keys to giving people a second

9
00:00:33.521 --> 00:00:37.570
chance who are incarcerated within the state of Colorado as well as in the

10
00:00:37.571 --> 00:00:40.990
United States.
And so you might think to yourself,
well,

11
00:00:40.991 --> 00:00:42.880
what does that mean to be an entrepreneur?
You know,

12
00:00:42.881 --> 00:00:46.450
how are you teaching entrepreneurship?
And I think what we have found,

13
00:00:46.451 --> 00:00:50.500
the best way to do that is just to give you a short glimpse into what happens

14
00:00:50.501 --> 00:00:51.760
into one of our prisons.

15
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.210
And so I'm just going to play for you a short video that I'm about 60 seconds

16
00:00:57.671 --> 00:00:58.504
long.

17
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.280
<v 2>Colorado should be the worst place to commit a violent crime,</v>

18
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.880
the best place to get a second chance.
I think what defy does,

19
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.280
it defies the odds.

20
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.050
It defies the traditional way of looking at,

21
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.690
at rehabilitation and kind of creates its own energy,

22
00:01:19.691 --> 00:01:22.390
its own hurricane,
a possibility.

23
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.960
My goodness,
this is a happy day.

24
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.230
We're showing that we can become more than our past.

25
00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.630
<v 0>So what do you think maybe not what you expect to be happening in prisons,</v>

26
00:01:58.631 --> 00:02:02.500
particularly in our,
um,
more secure prisons within the state.

27
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.810
And you probably got a sense from watching that video,
the energy,

28
00:02:07.811 --> 00:02:10.030
but also the passion that came from the community.

29
00:02:10.031 --> 00:02:12.370
You may be even recognized a few of the faces.

30
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.310
And part of the reason we love coming out to the community,

31
00:02:15.311 --> 00:02:18.830
particularly here in boulder to talk with everyone,
is to fight.

32
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.840
It was very much born out of the passion for innovation here in Boulder.

33
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.240
And I don't know if anybody recognizes,

34
00:02:25.241 --> 00:02:29.020
obviously we have the former governor up here,
Brad Feld,

35
00:02:29.021 --> 00:02:32.710
a couple of other people from the foundry group and the foundry group.

36
00:02:32.711 --> 00:02:37.400
We're really the proponents to bring defy ventures to Colorado.
Um,

37
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.190
that passion for entrepreneurship,

38
00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.240
that passion of bringing the community together to try to solve when a society's

39
00:02:43.241 --> 00:02:43.930
problems.

40
00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.930
And so our goal here today is to spend the next 10 to 15 minutes to tell you a

41
00:02:50.651 --> 00:02:54.010
little bit about defy ventures,
Colorado,
the kind of the what,

42
00:02:54.011 --> 00:02:55.120
the why and the how.

43
00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.810
And I'm going to have our program manager Stacy Pooka come up and do that.

44
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.090
And before we moved to that,
you know,

45
00:03:01.091 --> 00:03:03.640
I just want to encourage everybody in the room.

46
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.110
Our goal today is to make this as interactive as possible and so we'll have

47
00:03:08.111 --> 00:03:12.010
plenty of time for Q and a at the end.
But if anybody has any questions,

48
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.620
feel free to ask them at any point.

49
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.400
When we get done with our overview of the program from Stacy,

50
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.710
we've actually got a very diverse panel here who brings quite differing

51
00:03:23.711 --> 00:03:25.300
perspectives,
um,

52
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.360
from the incarcerated sector in terms of talking about defy the program,

53
00:03:31.451 --> 00:03:34.450
but more importantly how we can all come together to solve this issue.

54
00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:36.040
And so with that,

55
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.100
I'm going to turn it over to Stacy will come up and talk about the program.

56
00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.060
<v 3>So defy ventures,</v>

57
00:03:41.061 --> 00:03:45.170
Colorado was born out of the idea that we're all ex some things we think about

58
00:03:45.171 --> 00:03:45.681
our past.

59
00:03:45.681 --> 00:03:49.910
We can all think of something that we've done that we're not necessarily proud

60
00:03:49.911 --> 00:03:54.380
of and we believe in second chances and providing those second chances through

61
00:03:54.381 --> 00:03:55.214
entrepreneurship.

62
00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.680
We do that in a really unique way that most programs that work with people with

63
00:04:00.681 --> 00:04:04.550
criminal histories aren't able to do that.
We're very lucky to do so.

64
00:04:04.551 --> 00:04:09.551
We start inside presents and we provide an eight month long program called CEO

65
00:04:09.651 --> 00:04:13.850
of your new life where individuals engage in character development,

66
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.700
career readiness and entrepreneurial education.

67
00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:22.270
So you can see up here from our very complicated program diagram that we start

68
00:04:22.461 --> 00:04:24.110
inside the facilities and then we can,

69
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.770
can you to work with people once they are released from incarceration.
Um,

70
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.970
there are a few things that we do with them when they are released.
One is a,

71
00:04:32.971 --> 00:04:37.080
they go through what's called pathways to reentry where they basically,

72
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.100
um,
get stable in the community housing,

73
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.780
healthcare,
jobs,
financial stability,

74
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.550
so that they don't need to revert to old ways of thinking or being,
um,

75
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.510
they're stable.
Once they're stable within their communities,

76
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.320
they can go into our business incubator where they then learn to actually start

77
00:04:58.321 --> 00:05:02.610
and run their own small business that they planned and worked on while they were

78
00:05:02.611 --> 00:05:03.720
currently incarcerated.

79
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.620
So you can see that our mission is to transform the lives of people with

80
00:05:07.621 --> 00:05:10.890
criminal histories along the entrepreneurial journey.

81
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.300
The reason that we do this is because America has a prison crisis.

82
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.550
We have 5% of the world's population,

83
00:05:21.551 --> 00:05:24.070
but 20% of the world's incarcerated population,

84
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.770
30% of 23 year olds have a criminal history.

85
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.040
So whether you're watching this on your computer or you're sitting in the

86
00:05:32.041 --> 00:05:32.491
audience,

87
00:05:32.491 --> 00:05:35.610
how many of you can think of something really stupid that you did before the

88
00:05:35.611 --> 00:05:36.810
time you were 23?

89
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.193
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

90
00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:45.000
<v 3>we think that's really early to start writing people off.
Uh,</v>

91
00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.400
people who go to prison,

92
00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:51.490
67% of them are rearrested and go back to prison within three years of being

93
00:05:51.831 --> 00:05:54.320
released in Colorado,
it's 45%.

94
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.070
Having criminal history makes it

95
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.120
<v 0>significantly difficult to get and maintain employment.
Um,</v>

96
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.480
people who have a criminal history have employment rates that are 20% 27% lower

97
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.690
than other people.
And by checking the box,

98
00:06:11.691 --> 00:06:14.360
I have a felony history on a job application,

99
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.810
reduces their chances of getting a call back from an employer by 50%.

100
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.570
So not only do we have a program in prison that's eight months long where they

101
00:06:23.571 --> 00:06:27.500
work on character development,
entrepreneurship and career readiness,

102
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:32.030
we bring in volunteers to help them along that journey.
So last year alone,

103
00:06:32.031 --> 00:06:34.670
we brought in over 340 volunteers.

104
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:40.120
We brought in 450 to Googlers in our counterpart counterpart in northern

105
00:06:40.851 --> 00:06:41.684
California.

106
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.500
So googler's have been involved in this for a very long time in northern

107
00:06:45.501 --> 00:06:50.090
California and we're looking to get a Googlers here in Colorado involved as
well.

108
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:52.670
The secret sauce to what works,

109
00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:56.690
why this program works is the community that we built around the people who are

110
00:06:56.691 --> 00:06:57.860
currently incarcerated.

111
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.440
It's very rare for someone who's incarcerated to see anyone else other than

112
00:07:03.441 --> 00:07:05.750
correctional officers and their family members.

113
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.320
So to have these opportunities to talk about character development,

114
00:07:09.321 --> 00:07:13.190
career readiness and business with top executives.

115
00:07:13.191 --> 00:07:18.170
And empathetically minded people from the community allows them an extra

116
00:07:18.171 --> 00:07:23.171
advantage to success once they reintegrate into society that most people don't

117
00:07:23.931 --> 00:07:24.764
have.

118
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:30.400
So on that theme of building community and having this community travel with the

119
00:07:31.941 --> 00:07:34.460
people in our program,
from the inside to the outside,

120
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:38.240
I'm going to bring Bob back up and he's going to introduce some of our key

121
00:07:38.241 --> 00:07:40.910
stakeholders in the community who are going to give you guys a little bit more

122
00:07:40.911 --> 00:07:44.810
information.
So why don't we start with,
go down the line.

123
00:07:44.811 --> 00:07:46.640
Just start with a brief intro.
You know,

124
00:07:46.641 --> 00:07:48.620
a lot of it will come out as we go through our panel,

125
00:07:48.621 --> 00:07:52.280
but maybe spend one or two minutes just telling us a little bit about yourself

126
00:07:52.281 --> 00:07:55.400
and why you're here today.
And we'll start next to me with Brandon

127
00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:56.121
<v 4>some.</v>

128
00:07:56.121 --> 00:08:00.600
My name is Brannon Hagans on the gang intelligence supervisor at Colorado state

129
00:08:00.601 --> 00:08:01.770
penitentiary.
Um,

130
00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:06.150
Colorado state penitentiaries where we keep probably the most dangerous

131
00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:10.890
offenders in the state of Colorado.
And we were actually the first facility.

132
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:12.240
Where are we?
The first facility.

133
00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:15.120
We were the first facility to give this this program go.

134
00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:20.520
Initially when we were told that they were going to come in and this is what

135
00:08:20.521 --> 00:08:21.480
they wanted to do,

136
00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:27.080
it scared us just because of our federal population.
Um,

137
00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:32.670
so we sat down and we picked 20 guys that we thought we could put in a room

138
00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:35.490
without them trying to kill each other,
um,

139
00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:40.920
and keeping these wonderful individuals safe.
And it worked out.

140
00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:43.890
And from that initial class,

141
00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:48.690
just the amount of guys that are wanting to get into this and participate in it.

142
00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:50.550
I mean it's just been amazing.

143
00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:54.060
Our violence within our facility has dropped off drastically.

144
00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:55.980
I can't give you percentages,

145
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.790
<v 5>but I can tell you being there day in and day out that are violence has dropped</v>

146
00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:01.840
because these guys want to get in this program.

147
00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:04.590
They want to do better for themselves and learn something.

148
00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:09.880
<v 4>Hello,
my name is Bob Buckholtz.</v>

149
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.190
I worked for the Colorado Department of Corrections.

150
00:09:12.191 --> 00:09:15.250
I work at the Arkansas Valley correctional facility,

151
00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:19.030
but it's about two hours east of Pueblo.
Um,

152
00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:20.440
and defy has,

153
00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:25.530
from what we can tell has made a huge difference in our population as far as

154
00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:30.660
having an offenders involved in the program have bled over to them talking to

155
00:09:31.751 --> 00:09:34.810
staff,
which before,
I mean,
that's kind of a,

156
00:09:34.811 --> 00:09:39.170
the no man's land as far as offenders wanting to talk to staff.
Um,

157
00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:43.970
and defy when they're working on their programs,
um,

158
00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:47.660
the offenders are working on their,
their plans.
They ended up coming,

159
00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:52.320
asking staff for input,
which is,
is really neat.
That's really,

160
00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:54.700
it's a really neat opportunity for us and them.

161
00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:57.060
<v 1>Okay.</v>

162
00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:57.870
<v 6>Hi.
Um,</v>

163
00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:02.870
my name is Ronnie Madrid and I am an entrepreneur and training of graduate from

164
00:10:04.231 --> 00:10:07.890
the first class and Colorado state penitentiary.

165
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:12.450
I agree.
It's,
it's been amazing.

166
00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:18.020
I had to work my butt off to get into that class and it absolutely changed the

167
00:10:19.651 --> 00:10:22.770
path that I was taking before simply because

168
00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:28.530
the people with defy who came in as well as this gentleman right here day.

169
00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:30.090
There are the first ones,

170
00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:35.310
probably throughout my whole life actually gave me a chance and seeing that I

171
00:10:35.311 --> 00:10:39.870
wanted to do better so I can be better.
And,
um,
I,

172
00:10:39.871 --> 00:10:44.600
I've been able to present myself to the world working while I'm working on being

173
00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:45.510
scores my best.

174
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.640
And it's because of the things that I have around me now,

175
00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:54.420
the people that I have around me now from what I learned about myself in

176
00:10:54.421 --> 00:10:59.340
transition from being
a gang member,
a drug dealer,

177
00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:00.303
um,

178
00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:06.380
somebody who made terrible choices throughout his life to a single father who

179
00:11:08.401 --> 00:11:09.990
wants to learn how to cook.
Oh,

180
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.910
my kids don't have to eat hot pockets in who?
In he pebbles.

181
00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:20.100
And like they helped me when I,
when I'm out here like there is,

182
00:11:20.101 --> 00:11:22.860
he's always asking if she can help me with anything.

183
00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:27.510
It really does extend from the inside out when not a lot of programs do that are

184
00:11:27.511 --> 00:11:28.980
imposed.
The Department of Corrections.

185
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:31.463
<v 1>Thank you.</v>

186
00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:37.870
<v 5>Hey,
I'm Tom Layman.
Um,
I'm a volunteer in the community.</v>

187
00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:42.010
Um,
I'm on the defy ventures Colorado advisory board.

188
00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:43.523
<v 1>Uh,</v>

189
00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:49.810
<v 5>he used to work at Google Boulder Office,
um,
for six years a while back.</v>

190
00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:54.400
Now I'm with a company called building ventures.
But,
um,
yeah,
I've been,

191
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:59.850
I've been a volunteer with defy Colorado for for about a year.

192
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:02.583
<v 1>Oh,</v>

193
00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:07.310
<v 5>first sought from a Brad Feld blog post.</v>

194
00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:10.280
He was talking about his experience in prison and how,

195
00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:14.810
I mean the enthusiasm just completely came through on the blog post and at the

196
00:12:14.811 --> 00:12:18.440
end after describing his whole day and what it was like,
um,

197
00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:23.740
he had a Bob's email at the bottom and so I emailed Bob to find out how,

198
00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.280
you know,
what's the story with this thing?

199
00:12:25.281 --> 00:12:29.080
And he and Stacy and I went out to lunch and um,

200
00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:34.700
then Stacy is,
he and I went in to prison and um,
yeah,

201
00:12:34.701 --> 00:12:39.560
I lost track how many times I've gone back.
It's,
it's been a wonderful thing.

202
00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.380
<v 7>Oh Great.
You got,</v>

203
00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.850
my name is Travis Taylor and that wonderful,

204
00:12:47.851 --> 00:12:52.590
beautiful human being that you see to my left and your right with the long hair

205
00:12:52.591 --> 00:12:56.880
and glasses.
He and I are four years in,
four hours apart.

206
00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:01.410
He is my younger brother.
His name is Darrius Taylor.
I am the very,

207
00:13:01.411 --> 00:13:04.600
very proud brother of anarchic solve Allen,

208
00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:08.910
a correctional facility EIT in graduate.
Uh,

209
00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:12.780
I met Bob at,
uh,
my little brother's graduation.

210
00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:16.710
And to say the meeting was life changing is,

211
00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:19.620
does not do it justice.
Uh,

212
00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:25.220
defy in order for it to reach the communities the way that we expected,

213
00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.560
we will need,
uh,

214
00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:32.490
people such as yourselves to see what we see.

215
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:38.030
And part of that is going to be today and I hope you become as excited about

216
00:13:38.791 --> 00:13:43.590
joining the fi and having it do what it did in my life and in my family's life

217
00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.920
for you and yours.
So I thank you all for being here.

218
00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:49.650
<v 0>That's great.
So we've got</v>

219
00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:55.910
about as diverse as you can get in this issue to people who actually work inside

220
00:13:55.911 --> 00:13:56.500
the prisons.

221
00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:00.860
Somebody who was in prison and then two volunteers and one who brings the family

222
00:14:00.861 --> 00:14:04.730
perspective that's there.
You know,
the question I would like to go to and um,

223
00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:08.090
I guess I'm going to do this because the two people who drove the farthest,
Bob,

224
00:14:08.091 --> 00:14:08.631
you drove what,

225
00:14:08.631 --> 00:14:11.570
about three and a half hours to come up here for an hour or bringing in about

226
00:14:11.571 --> 00:14:15.530
two and a half hours is
why'd you do that?
I mean,

227
00:14:15.531 --> 00:14:20.531
why did you get in the car and drive up here and come here and talk and explain

228
00:14:21.591 --> 00:14:24.620
the perspective from your standpoint.
Bob,
do you want to go first?
Sure.

229
00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:31.570
You know,
I made the trip because defy has,
like I stated earlier,

230
00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:36.550
it has made it a huge impact for us on the prison population.

231
00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.193
<v 5>MMM.</v>

232
00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:41.580
<v 0>He was actually impressive when the first day they came in there.</v>

233
00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:43.500
We had over a hundred offenders

234
00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:45.900
<v 5>and um,</v>

235
00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.730
<v 0>they started,
it started off the program there.</v>

236
00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:52.850
It was amazing how they could control the offender population

237
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:54.240
<v 4>in that room.
Um,</v>

238
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:59.210
the respect that happened between the volunteers and the actual offenders in the

239
00:14:59.211 --> 00:15:04.211
room was just incredible and it was really nice for us to see a staff working in

240
00:15:04.281 --> 00:15:06.410
there because we're there to help.

241
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:09.650
We're not there to punish the courts have already done that.

242
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:13.910
Our job as to help out for them to be successful.

243
00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:18.440
And it's great because when you looked at defies a mission statement,

244
00:15:18.441 --> 00:15:21.440
it actually leads right into our mission statement,

245
00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.950
which is a successful reentry of all offenders back into society.

246
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:29.930
So it really matches up well.
That's worked very well.
Um,

247
00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:34.580
it keeps him busy.
He can walk through at night,
um,

248
00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:36.590
do cell checks,
look in the doors,

249
00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:40.610
they're actually working on their business plan.
They take it serious.

250
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:43.760
So it's been been a really,

251
00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:48.200
really good program and we believe in Brandon,
what about you?

252
00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:53.070
So for me,
coming from a CSP in,

253
00:15:53.071 --> 00:15:55.070
in just the clientele that we have there,

254
00:15:55.400 --> 00:16:00.130
when we initially walked these guys into the room to start this program,
um,

255
00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:04.730
usually when they leave the day hall,
they're fully restrained.
Wrists,
ankles,

256
00:16:04.731 --> 00:16:06.470
they've got handcuffs everywhere.

257
00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:10.220
And this was the first time we ever took these individuals and put them in our

258
00:16:10.221 --> 00:16:14.270
visiting room and took the cuffs off with a bunch of volunteers.

259
00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:18.500
And it was,
it was kind of hairy.
It,
it didn't feel right for the environment.

260
00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:22.280
But once they got rolling with the program,

261
00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:26.330
I mean these guys were standing up hugging each other and you know,

262
00:16:26.331 --> 00:16:30.580
the whole time I'm thinking,
please don't hurt anybody but this,

263
00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:34.580
this program gave them hope.
You know,
with the volunteers coming in,

264
00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:37.210
a lot of these guys,
they don't get family to come in.

265
00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:40.970
They don't have much communication at all.
And when the volunteers come in,

266
00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:44.510
they give them a sense of being a sense of hope,
a sense of purpose.

267
00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:49.670
And it's just amazing to see their faces light up,
the changes they make,

268
00:16:49.671 --> 00:16:51.870
their demeanor,
their attitudes.
It's,

269
00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:54.170
it's just amazing to watch these guys change.

270
00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:59.640
<v 0>Ron,
I want to direct this next question to you cause I think what would be</v>

271
00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:03.450
beneficial for the people here in the level of watching on video is to

272
00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:07.200
understand that that initial engagement point,
right.

273
00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:08.880
We didn't talk about it earlier,

274
00:17:08.881 --> 00:17:12.690
but real quickly the defy program is an eight month program.

275
00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:14.850
I would describe it as intensive,

276
00:17:14.851 --> 00:17:18.450
obviously would love your opinion on that hour or two day to stay up with it.

277
00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:23.220
Why did you come into the program and then what kept you going through those

278
00:17:23.221 --> 00:17:24.054
eight months?

279
00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:28.260
Because obviously there were the ups and downs of life that were happening as

280
00:17:28.261 --> 00:17:30.450
you went through that.
Okay.

281
00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:34.860
<v 4>I came into the program because it's an entrepreneurship program.</v>

282
00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:39.370
I was in prison for a distribution case.
Um,

283
00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.010
I gang banged my whole life.
I,

284
00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:48.430
<v 0>it's my wife 18 months ago to a drug overdose,
she started using drugs.</v>

285
00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:49.950
Same that I was selling.

286
00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:55.290
<v 6>Um,
she lost her life.
Eventually after it,
our kids were separated.</v>

287
00:17:55.890 --> 00:18:00.860
I'm still fighting for my kids right now.
And so when,

288
00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:05.940
when that stuff started to happen to me and I seen where my life was headed,

289
00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:10.640
I realized that it was time for me to absolutely make a change on our,

290
00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:13.560
I was in a diet prison and at that point,

291
00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:19.290
most important thing to me was family.
And I have a job right now.

292
00:18:19.291 --> 00:18:20.160
I'm in a halfway house.

293
00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:25.110
I got out December 26th and it's the third job that I've ever had in my life.
Um,

294
00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:28.950
but the entrepreneurship program,

295
00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:33.510
when I went in there and we were working on our resumes and like our job skills

296
00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:39.330
or realize that I have marketing,
distribution,
quality control,

297
00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.380
customer surveys,
like how all of these,

298
00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:48.200
I have all of these skills that I can try that are transferable skills that got

299
00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:49.860
Stacy as you know,

300
00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:56.850
you could do these.
And I realized I absolutely can.

301
00:18:56.851 --> 00:18:58.260
And I will.
Um,

302
00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:01.560
right now I'm trying to get it approved with the halfway house for me to go to

303
00:19:01.561 --> 00:19:05.940
metro state.
Um,
I want to go for organizational communication so I can be,

304
00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:10.410
um,
you know,
a mentor or a consultant,
you know,

305
00:19:10.411 --> 00:19:14.640
I want to be able to,
you know,
just just passed the buck.

306
00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:19.710
I also want to look into some,
you know,
certification for addictions counseling,

307
00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:23.370
um,
simply because I've been on both sides of the dope game.

308
00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:25.650
I've been in the streets.
Um,

309
00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:29.120
I was a gang leader from my neighborhood and I walked away and that was the

310
00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:32.010
scariest to walk away from the streets.

311
00:19:32.011 --> 00:19:36.870
It was the scariest thing that I've ever done in my life because I had,

312
00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:43.350
I had made it through the ups and the downs,
the Colorado state penitentiary.

313
00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:45.200
Um,
I dunno if he's are aware,

314
00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:48.450
but it's the absolute worst at the state of Colorado has to offer as far as

315
00:19:48.451 --> 00:19:52.530
punishment minus the death penalty.
Um,
you,
you go to prison,

316
00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.930
you're getting in trouble,
you go to prison,
you get in trouble in prison,

317
00:19:54.931 --> 00:19:56.880
you go to the hole,
you get,
you keep getting in trouble.

318
00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:01.020
They send you a book to Colorado State Penitentiary and it's a war zone.

319
00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:03.290
It's a war zone.
Um,

320
00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:07.890
they let us out for breakfast and everybody's running to the shower so they

321
00:20:07.891 --> 00:20:10.380
could go get their shower because we might've been locked down for six,

322
00:20:10.381 --> 00:20:14.190
seven days because of the stabbing or salt or something like that.

323
00:20:14.191 --> 00:20:17.670
And as soon as three,
four minutes later,

324
00:20:17.671 --> 00:20:21.000
it's due to do to first responders and it's literally a war zone.

325
00:20:21.001 --> 00:20:25.740
But when the fire came and we were ready to go every Tuesday,
I was like,

326
00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:30.240
I'm gone.
I'm leaving this place.
I'm getting some sanity on Canton,
you know,

327
00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:34.650
some piece for a while because everybody in that program,
you know,
it was like,

328
00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.590
this is not what we're doing.
This is what we're doing for us tomorrow.

329
00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:42.390
We can leave all the politics and all the prison stuff back at the house.

330
00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:45.030
And everybody did it.
And I don't know how these people did it.

331
00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:48.430
I don't know how Bob and Stacy and the volunteers and everybody came in,

332
00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:51.880
but they did it.
I got seriously.

333
00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:57.070
This man right here said they do arcs and people are doing their homework and

334
00:20:57.071 --> 00:20:58.330
their big books like this,

335
00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:03.020
and I would literally stay in my room some days for two,

336
00:21:03.021 --> 00:21:08.021
three hours thinking about what I need to say for this answer because it

337
00:21:08.771 --> 00:21:12.760
affected me because I really wanted that change and these people really put

338
00:21:12.761 --> 00:21:15.970
forth the effort and the time and were patient with us.

339
00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:20.950
They literally laid on the floor with us and we're like,
we're here.

340
00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:25.060
We got something.
If you want to accept it,
fine.
You know what I mean?

341
00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:29.080
We're willing to give it to all the way through and they followed through.

342
00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:31.750
You know,
it started in the inside.

343
00:21:31.751 --> 00:21:36.070
I came out and this is the best I've ever done in my life.

344
00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.860
This is the best I've ever done in my life.

345
00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.500
I know for sure I'll be a multimillionaire or five years of the jeep.

346
00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:49.320
<v 0>Seriously,
but
that's great.</v>

347
00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:52.980
I think that's interesting,
right?
As we go down the line,

348
00:21:52.981 --> 00:21:56.430
we hear the impact in prisons.
We hear the impact Ron and your life.

349
00:21:56.431 --> 00:22:01.431
But I want to switch to hear about the impact that Tom and Travis have seen,

350
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.420
both from themselves in the community.
But I think Travis,

351
00:22:06.421 --> 00:22:11.040
I want to start with you is also talk a little bit about the impact you've seen

352
00:22:11.041 --> 00:22:14.160
in your brother.
Um,
Darya Sue's at Arkansas Valley.

353
00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:16.693
<v 7>So,</v>

354
00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:20.973
<v 1>oh,</v>

355
00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:25.010
<v 7>usually I tell the story about,
you know,</v>

356
00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:29.360
my brother and how he wound up,
uh,
in prison.

357
00:22:29.361 --> 00:22:31.730
But listening to that,

358
00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:34.430
I want to back up just a second.

359
00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:40.240
So when my brother first went to prison the first time,

360
00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:45.740
uh,
it was in 2001 or 2008,

361
00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:48.350
he went from 2000 to 2005,

362
00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:52.550
he's in the federal penitentiary and he was prosecuted under something called

363
00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:58.190
project exile,
where if you carry a gun,
illegal gun in the state of Colorado,

364
00:22:58.191 --> 00:23:02.030
you automatically got a five year federal prison.
Since don't pass,
go.

365
00:23:02.031 --> 00:23:05.660
Don't collect $200.
Don't say hi to your mom.
You're gone.

366
00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:07.670
My brother was 19 years old.

367
00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:11.780
My brother went to prison at 19 way.

368
00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:15.050
He was five four five five weighing 140 pounds.

369
00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:20.390
My brother came out of prison weighing 215 pounds

370
00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:22.873
<v 1>and</v>

371
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:26.530
<v 7>he looked like one of them action figures from Batman or something.</v>

372
00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:32.330
Now the rest of us were like,
oh,
okay.
Well my brother stayed free.

373
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:35.680
Exactly six weeks,
six weeks.

374
00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:41.860
That second time
they sent my brother away for 44 years.

375
00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:49.310
Let that sink in your head for a second 44 years.

376
00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:54.830
The problem with that is my brother wasn't doing 44 years alone.

377
00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:00.290
My mother,
myself,
my father,
his sister,

378
00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:02.060
nieces,
nephews,

379
00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:06.110
we all got that 44 year prison sentence.

380
00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:10.240
We all got the five year prison sentence.

381
00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:13.440
We all got the six weeks furlough.

382
00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:18.700
So my brother never understood this concept.

383
00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:22.420
No matter how many times we tried to talk to him,

384
00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:26.470
there was a period where I didn't write,
speak,
or talk to my brother.

385
00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:31.510
He'd write letters.
I take the letters and someday if I ever see y'all again,

386
00:24:31.511 --> 00:24:35.170
I'll show you.
I kept the box and Yo,
y'all didn't know this.

387
00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:40.480
I kept the box of the unopened letters because I didn't feel he deserved my

388
00:24:40.481 --> 00:24:45.481
energy or time to read another excuse another,

389
00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:51.520
I won't happen again because it kept happening.
Even when he was in prison,

390
00:24:51.521 --> 00:24:52.570
it kept happening.

391
00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:57.520
Then defy comes along and I'm going to kind of speed it up.

392
00:24:57.521 --> 00:25:02.521
Now the fire comes along and his entire thought pattern of how he processed

393
00:25:06.761 --> 00:25:10.690
information changed the way he carried himself.

394
00:25:10.691 --> 00:25:13.780
Change the way you started talking changed.

395
00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:18.940
He said something that I'd never heard him say before to visit and he goes,

396
00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:24.970
I did.
Excuse me.
What Hon?
What?
He said I did.
I did everything they said I did.

397
00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:27.543
<v 1>I did it all.</v>

398
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:32.280
<v 7>I made that mistake but that was me then.
That's not me now.</v>

399
00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.610
So while you're healing this visit,
you have a choice.
You can,

400
00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:40.590
you can keep looking at me for who I was or you can look at me for what?

401
00:25:40.591 --> 00:25:41.424
I'm trying to be calm.

402
00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:47.970
I have seen my brother virtually every weekend since that meeting.

403
00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:54.360
I was proud to go to his graduation.
I walked up to Bob,

404
00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:57.460
cause they don't,
they,
you weren't supposed to get up and walk around like,

405
00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.880
cause it's a prison,
you know,
you weren't supposed to be moving.

406
00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:03.050
But the guy that saw me was like,
hey,
you know,
I was like,

407
00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:05.780
can I go talk to this guy?
And I'm pointing to Bob and he's like,
ah,

408
00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:07.530
I ain't see it.

409
00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:10.590
So I jumped up and I run over to Bob and he's in the middle of talking to

410
00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:15.360
somebody and I'm trying to keep it together,
but I can't stop crying.

411
00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:16.560
And it wasn't sadness.

412
00:26:16.561 --> 00:26:20.580
It was absolutely elation because I had never seen my brother graduate from

413
00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:24.290
anything but a prison sentence to another prison sentence.

414
00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:26.800
That's all I had seen.

415
00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:31.990
And now I see my brother walked around with his chest out,
his head's up.

416
00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:36.420
Amy's recognizing not only what he was but who we can become.

417
00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:40.030
And I'll walk through the Barb and I told him,
I said,
Bob,
listen,
I own a company.

418
00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:43.860
It's a,
it's a finance company.
I make a little bit of money,
not like this,

419
00:26:43.861 --> 00:26:48.190
but I make some money.
And I said,
Bob,
whatever you want,
I'll write you a check.

420
00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:50.970
They'll do whatever you need,
whatever you need.
He was like,

421
00:26:50.971 --> 00:26:54.060
I don't really know you,
but okay,
cool.
And I'm sitting there like,

422
00:26:54.061 --> 00:26:56.400
I love you people.
When he was like,
I just met you.
I was like,
no,
no,

423
00:26:56.401 --> 00:26:58.110
I still love you.
Right.

424
00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:02.880
And he and Stacy gave myself and a gentleman in the back there is my business

425
00:27:02.881 --> 00:27:07.290
partner named Gil dads and young young lady in their main Kayla go lady.

426
00:27:07.291 --> 00:27:10.200
She just got married,
everybody okay with La.
Um,

427
00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:16.550
and they decided to help me with Bob and Stacy and easy and listening to you.

428
00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:25.640
I can only imagine what that felt like walking out the door and changing your

429
00:27:26.551 --> 00:27:31.320
life for the good.
These two gentlemen,
you know,

430
00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:34.080
we were not going to knock them forward.
They do for their,
for their living.

431
00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:36.240
Cause they,
they,
they have a purpose,

432
00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:40.620
but I'm certain they're happy to hear that they will never meet you in their

433
00:27:40.621 --> 00:27:43.710
professional life again.
Right.

434
00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:47.550
And that's,
that's really what this is about.

435
00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:49.440
That's what I guess you wanted me to tell you.

436
00:27:49.441 --> 00:27:52.920
I'm not going to bore you with all the family history,

437
00:27:52.921 --> 00:27:57.921
but the bottom line is my little brother is now a different person and it would

438
00:27:58.051 --> 00:28:02.790
have never happened.
Listened to me very closely.
They say,
never use the word,

439
00:28:02.791 --> 00:28:03.600
never.

440
00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:07.950
It would have never happened without Bob and Stacy.

441
00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:12.720
My brother came from a two parent home.
My Dad was in the military,

442
00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:15.390
my mom was a registered dietician.

443
00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:19.260
We all went to college.
He had a football scholarship.

444
00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:24.000
There was absolutely no reason for him to ever join a gang,

445
00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:27.870
let alone put that monstrosity that's on his back.

446
00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:29.760
But he did

447
00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:36.090
and now he's understanding that he did not belong in prison

448
00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:41.550
except to learn.
The life he had was a blessing.

449
00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:46.800
You've learned the life that you have is a blessing no matter what environment

450
00:28:46.801 --> 00:28:47.634
you're in.

451
00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:53.480
Defy gave that back to my family and as I told you then I'll tell you now for

452
00:28:54.091 --> 00:28:58.680
the rest of my life,
whatever you need,
whenever you need it,

453
00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:02.520
you call
and I hope you do.

454
00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:08.250
And I think the Fi forgiving my family and opportunity to have my brother back.

455
00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:12.060
And I think you for all your hard work,

456
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:15.270
he stay on him while you in there

457
00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:21.720
and bring my brother home because I know once he comes home,

458
00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:27.350
the only time we'll ever think about you is when we see you at a five it because

459
00:29:27.901 --> 00:29:30.930
you will never see them in your professional capacity again.

460
00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:36.740
And I thank you and define Stacy for all of that and I hope all of you join us

461
00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:39.450
with working with the fire.
I really do.

462
00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:41.710
It'll change your lives cause it changed hours.

463
00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:47.620
<v 0>Well what,
so let me just jump in because what are we really saying here,
right?</v>

464
00:29:47.621 --> 00:29:48.460
I mean we've,

465
00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:50.230
<v 1>yeah,</v>

466
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:52.260
<v 0>I mean let's just reframe it.
We,
we,</v>

467
00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:55.300
we don't have a shortage of people in prisons,
right?

468
00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:58.260
We don't have a shortage of programs in prisons,
right?
These,

469
00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:03.250
these are one off situations with Ronnie,
with Dario Sucks Cetera.

470
00:30:03.251 --> 00:30:07.600
That's here.
You know,
I have my belief of what we're talking about here,

471
00:30:07.601 --> 00:30:12.601
which is this issue of volunteerism and collective community impact.

472
00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:15.790
What I'm actually interested following on Travis,
this point,
Tom,

473
00:30:15.791 --> 00:30:17.860
is to hear from you what,

474
00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:22.270
what's been your experience as a volunteer?
I mean,
you didn't,

475
00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:24.580
assuming you'd never been in a prison before,

476
00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:27.940
before you came in with the five for the first time,
you know,

477
00:30:27.941 --> 00:30:32.941
before we talked about what 340 plus volunteers that came in in 2018 who made

478
00:30:33.911 --> 00:30:38.440
the two and a half hour drive from boulder and places.
I mean,

479
00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:42.950
how many times have you been to prison with us?
I'm not sure.

480
00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:47.090
I have sort of lost count.
Yeah.
I mean it easily has to be about five.
I mean,

481
00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:52.430
it's double digits,
but,
um,
but,
but,
but,
but,
but what is it from your perspective?

482
00:30:52.431 --> 00:30:53.270
Right.
You don't,

483
00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:56.540
you don't come with Travis as background of having a loved one who had been in

484
00:30:56.541 --> 00:30:57.950
prison.
Um,

485
00:30:58.890 --> 00:30:59.360
<v 1>okay.</v>

486
00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:01.670
<v 0>What is it from that perspective,</v>

487
00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:05.060
from the volunteer's perspective you think that makes it work?

488
00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:12.510
<v 5>Well,
I think,
you know,</v>

489
00:31:12.511 --> 00:31:17.030
what motivates you to go in and then what your experience is once you're in

490
00:31:17.031 --> 00:31:18.420
inner sort of two different stories.

491
00:31:18.421 --> 00:31:22.220
And I think the thing that motivated me to go in is

492
00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:24.510
<v 1>yeah,</v>

493
00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:28.410
<v 5>it's probably a little fuzzy.
You know,
as I get older I'm more curious about,</v>

494
00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:29.950
<v 1>okay.</v>

495
00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:33.940
<v 5>Different People's experiences,
um,
more may be aware of,</v>

496
00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:35.563
<v 1>of,
um,</v>

497
00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:41.880
<v 5>some of the benefits I've had in my life.
Um,
but,
but mostly</v>

498
00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:46.760
I'm kind of a sucker for a cause and I didn't know if this was going to be,

499
00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:49.790
you know,
I didn't know this is going to be done because I just thought it was an

500
00:31:49.791 --> 00:31:52.070
interesting thing to do.
And so,
um,

501
00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:53.180
<v 1>okay.</v>

502
00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:57.910
<v 5>I talked to Bob and Stacy and they made it sound great and so I hopped in the</v>

503
00:31:57.911 --> 00:32:00.150
car and drove dark and South Valley.

504
00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:01.430
<v 1>Okay.</v>

505
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:04.210
<v 5>It's a long drive and it's a long time to think about,</v>

506
00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:05.770
<v 1>okay,</v>

507
00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:08.980
<v 5>wow,
I'm going to walk into a prison.
To me,
I really been in a prison that's um,</v>

508
00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:10.070
<v 1>okay,</v>

509
00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:11.990
<v 5>maybe that's a little bit out of my comfort zone.</v>

510
00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:16.220
Maybe I wonder why I signed up for this.
Exactly.
Um,
he,

511
00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:21.300
and so you go in,
or at least I went in,
um,
with,
with Stacy.

512
00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:25.550
Is He that first time?
It was to,
to speak to a class.
Um,

513
00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:30.020
every,
every week there's a class with a,
a different topic.

514
00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:34.220
And I think I was talking about,
um,
sort of personal brand and,

515
00:32:34.221 --> 00:32:38.330
and raising money and,
and that sort of thing.
And,
um,

516
00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.460
I walked in the room

517
00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:42.673
<v 1>and</v>

518
00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:47.990
<v 5>all these guys were in green,
just sort of made a beeline right for me.</v>

519
00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:53.400
Everyone had a giant grin on their face and their handout and it wasn't like

520
00:32:53.811 --> 00:32:56.150
that polite,
well,
it's very nice to meet you.

521
00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:59.660
It was like they were site to see me and I wasn't exactly sure why they were

522
00:32:59.661 --> 00:33:00.321
psyched to see me,

523
00:33:00.321 --> 00:33:03.680
but it was like this instant acceptance that you don't get when you're just sort

524
00:33:03.681 --> 00:33:08.420
of walk into a business meeting.
And,
um,
so that felt,

525
00:33:08.421 --> 00:33:12.620
I mean it was immediately at feeling comfortable with the whole thing.

526
00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:13.873
And um,

527
00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:19.260
I got on with my presentation and,
uh,

528
00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:23.990
we were talking about ways to fund your company,
so,
you know,
we're talking about,

529
00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:24.680
I mean,

530
00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:28.820
bootstrapping or friends and family round or an angel or venture or whatever.

531
00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:34.040
And somebody raised their hand and said,
hey,
what about a bank loan?

532
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.010
And I started to answer and realized,
you know,

533
00:33:37.011 --> 00:33:42.011
I've never really been involved in one of those transactions with a startup with

534
00:33:42.351 --> 00:33:44.970
a bank loan.
And so I started to explain it,
you know,

535
00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:48.830
this isn't something I have a lot of experience in.
And this guy in the back row,

536
00:33:48.831 --> 00:33:52.810
one of the EIT is a back row,
raises his hand.
He's like,
excuse me.
Uh,

537
00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:55.790
the first company that I started actually we started with a bank loan.

538
00:33:55.791 --> 00:33:57.230
I could address this if you'd like.

539
00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:02.500
And this guy gave a great explanation of how that works.

540
00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:07.580
And it was at that moment that I realized,
wow,

541
00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:09.730
I totally sold these guys short.

542
00:34:09.731 --> 00:34:14.060
And as you listen to the questions they asked and the points they made,

543
00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:15.183
um,

544
00:34:16.650 --> 00:34:19.800
there were a bunch of very sharp,

545
00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:24.090
super motivated people in that room and you realize,
oh my gosh,

546
00:34:24.091 --> 00:34:27.470
there's a ton of potential locked up in this space.
Um,

547
00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:31.940
I think the other thing above the totally motivated me was,
um,

548
00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:39.090
the way these guys make themselves vulnerable.
I mean,
part of every,

549
00:34:39.091 --> 00:34:40.650
every session starts with,
okay,

550
00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:41.683
<v 1>MMM,</v>

551
00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:46.580
<v 5>commitments,
thank you,
commitments and affirmations.</v>

552
00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:50.300
And one of them is,
um,
I will be vulnerable.

553
00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:53.270
And you know,
you just,

554
00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:58.280
you just know from life experience that you can have so much better conversation

555
00:34:58.281 --> 00:34:59.114
with someone.

556
00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:02.870
You can learn so much more from them and then they can get more from you if you

557
00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:04.970
allow yourselves to make yourself vulnerable.

558
00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:07.280
What'd you think about it in prison?

559
00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:11.720
That's probably the last thing that you want to be is,

560
00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:12.740
is vulnerable.

561
00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:16.110
<v 1>Yeah.
Um,</v>

562
00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:22.380
<v 5>and so the fact that they could come into this room and have so much trust in</v>

563
00:35:22.381 --> 00:35:26.250
each other and the volunteers and they can just flip that switch and be

564
00:35:26.251 --> 00:35:31.251
completely open and vulnerable for a couple hours and then go back to the

565
00:35:33.421 --> 00:35:38.070
regular life and turn that off.
I mean,
to me that just showed they're willing to

566
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:42.330
<v 0>make a giant leap to make this work.
That cannot be an easy thing.
Um,</v>

567
00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:47.420
and I think that was one of the things that partly sold me on the effort that

568
00:35:48.271 --> 00:35:49.170
they put into it,

569
00:35:49.171 --> 00:35:54.171
but partly just made it so much more rewarding for me and made us such a

570
00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:57.990
privilege to spend time with these guys and get to know him a little bit.

571
00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:02.720
And you know,
I think that's an interesting point on the vulnerability and,

572
00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:04.170
and you know,
Ron,

573
00:36:04.171 --> 00:36:08.940
I want to to come back to you and your experience being on the inside.
You know,

574
00:36:08.941 --> 00:36:11.340
we use the word Eit,
entrepreneur and training,

575
00:36:11.341 --> 00:36:16.320
which everybody who comes into our program,
you know,
that's what their title is.

576
00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:22.020
What was the impact of that volunteers and those volunteers coming into the

577
00:36:22.021 --> 00:36:24.120
facility week after week,

578
00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:27.660
not only how to kind of tie into your personal journey,

579
00:36:27.661 --> 00:36:32.661
but how did it tie into that aspect of vulnerability of people feeling like,

580
00:36:32.761 --> 00:36:37.320
you know,
they can kind of not let their guard down,
for lack of a better term,

581
00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:41.580
but to work on what's important in terms of making transformational change.

582
00:36:43.210 --> 00:36:44.920
<v 6>Well the thing is,</v>

583
00:36:44.921 --> 00:36:49.180
is everybody in prison wants to change every single person.

584
00:36:49.181 --> 00:36:52.180
I don't care who it is,
everyone,
everyone is tired of it.

585
00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:55.100
Especially repeat offenders.
Um,

586
00:36:55.270 --> 00:37:00.270
I'm a repeat offender actually doing all your brother that we were,

587
00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:05.290
we started out together at the same time in prison and um,

588
00:37:05.350 --> 00:37:08.710
he had just got out of the feds and I was on my way back to prison.

589
00:37:08.711 --> 00:37:12.130
We were in Denver County together.
We used to worry,
that's good friend of mine.

590
00:37:12.131 --> 00:37:14.830
I just haven't seen him forever.
But um,

591
00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:19.750
especially repeat offenders were always like,
I'm so tired of this.

592
00:37:19.751 --> 00:37:21.700
I'm tired of tired of it.
I'm tired of it.

593
00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:26.760
But there was never anything available to us simply because of our jackets,

594
00:37:29.770 --> 00:37:34.450
our background of who we are on paper.
Um,

595
00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:40.740
the recidivism rate stays high because nobody knows who we are because nobody

596
00:37:41.321 --> 00:37:45.430
gives us the chance.
Up until very recently,
I stopped.

597
00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:50.460
I grew up in the juvenile system and spent about 13 and a half years of my adult

598
00:37:51.191 --> 00:37:56.191
life in the adult system and I take full responsibility for the choices that I

599
00:37:57.341 --> 00:38:00.460
made and sentences were deserved.

600
00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:06.050
They were deserved because I was making poor life choices and I was where I

601
00:38:06.051 --> 00:38:10.750
needed to be.
Going back to what I said in the beginning,

602
00:38:10.751 --> 00:38:13.690
everybody wants to change.
Everybody wants to change.

603
00:38:13.691 --> 00:38:16.090
And even when we speak up and when I call,
I want to do this no more.

604
00:38:17.050 --> 00:38:18.220
Up until very recently,

605
00:38:18.221 --> 00:38:20.710
the department of Corrections hasn't been the department of Corrections.

606
00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:25.030
It never corrected behavior.
It was the department of confinement.

607
00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:28.720
They would lock us up and CSP,
they just opened it up.
Um,

608
00:38:28.930 --> 00:38:30.280
it's a close facility now,

609
00:38:30.281 --> 00:38:35.281
but I did six years in solitary confinement because of the choices that I made

610
00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:40.780
in cider prison.
Huh.
And um,

611
00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:47.980
nobody cared about what I wanted to do because I was just like everybody else.

612
00:38:47.981 --> 00:38:51.340
Like I said,
everybody inside wants to change and they speak it.

613
00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:54.070
I don't want to do this no more.
I don't want to do this no more.

614
00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:59.030
The fact of the matter is,
it's another world inside.
Um,

615
00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:03.490
being vulnerable is the last thing that you want to be in prison.

616
00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:08.320
You have to be an Alpha male or you're going to be somebody,

617
00:39:08.321 --> 00:39:09.460
something that you don't want to be,

618
00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:13.660
you're going to be the victim of something or somebody.
And

619
00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:18.850
when the fire would bring their volunteers and you know,
all of us,

620
00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:24.150
we couldn't wait to go to class on Tuesday and because it was five hours away

621
00:39:24.431 --> 00:39:28.720
from,
you know,
the craziest stuff that you could imagine,
uh,

622
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.240
you never,
you never realize what people could do to people.

623
00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:37.450
Um,
when you,

624
00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:42.430
when you're in a war zone and you go into them classes and,

625
00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:46.840
um,
these people right here,
they would come up and

626
00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:49.990
they didn't look at you like that.

627
00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:56.370
They wanted to hear what you actually had to say about your business or about

628
00:39:56.411 --> 00:40:00.760
your day or about your family,
um,
about what you wanted to do.

629
00:40:00.761 --> 00:40:05.320
And they really wanted to help you.
Every conversation that I had with anybody,

630
00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:10.900
um,
as far as the volunteer that came up,
they've,
they've held true to their word.

631
00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:13.780
They seriously have held true to that word.

632
00:40:13.810 --> 00:40:18.810
And I feel like the way to lower the recidivism rate is for people to get to

633
00:40:19.721 --> 00:40:22.000
know who we are.
You know,

634
00:40:22.001 --> 00:40:24.850
we're not a product of our land and our environments.

635
00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:26.710
We're just product the choices that we've made.

636
00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:30.100
Sometimes we didn't know any better on her and everything in life through trial

637
00:40:30.101 --> 00:40:34.780
and error.
I didn't have a dad or a big brother or anybody to show me on.

638
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:38.620
My parents were there.
Um,
I've been on my own since I was 13,

639
00:40:40.210 --> 00:40:41.043
so

640
00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:48.360
when they would come in and just get to know us and see who the type of people

641
00:40:49.391 --> 00:40:53.500
who we are and not the crime that we committed,

642
00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:56.020
it made them look at us different.

643
00:40:57.310 --> 00:41:01.660
So if you guys want to lower the recidivism rate,
his Colorado,

644
00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:06.760
get to know some criminals who want to change,
you know,
be volunteers.

645
00:41:06.761 --> 00:41:09.220
Go up and speak with the people after the five minutes,

646
00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:14.890
even if it's just one time.
Because I guarantee it's everybody wants to change,

647
00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:19.750
everybody wants to change.
For the most part.
A lot of people just don't know how.

648
00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:24.730
I think that's looking at the clock.

649
00:41:24.731 --> 00:41:27.430
I want to make sure we leave enough time for question and answers.

650
00:41:27.431 --> 00:41:30.280
So try to drive towards a wrap up.
But I think,
Randy,

651
00:41:30.281 --> 00:41:34.220
that's a perfect segue to what I'd like for the final question

652
00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:39.220
<v 0>to be is what can the community do to solve this issue of recidivism and in a</v>

653
00:41:41.091 --> 00:41:46.010
more finite level to support what's happening here in the state of Colorado?

654
00:41:46.011 --> 00:41:47.540
And I,
I guess,
Travis,

655
00:41:47.541 --> 00:41:51.530
I'd like to start with you because I think your perspective,
you know,

656
00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:53.990
you've seen it coming back to your brother,

657
00:41:53.991 --> 00:41:56.990
but you're also an entrepreneur yourself.
And so,
you know,

658
00:41:57.020 --> 00:42:00.770
I think it's an interesting perspective of saying what can people in the

659
00:42:00.771 --> 00:42:01.760
community do?

660
00:42:03.350 --> 00:42:07.420
<v 7>So I'm glad I was asked that question.
Uh,</v>

661
00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:12.440
indulge me for a second.
Everybody in this room put your hands up like this.

662
00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:16.830
All right.
Just keep them up there for a second.

663
00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:20.393
Think about this.

664
00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:26.680
Imagine you just walked out of prison and you just applied for a job and they

665
00:42:28.611 --> 00:42:30.770
told you they're going to call you back.

666
00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:33.800
And this is the ninth time today.

667
00:42:33.801 --> 00:42:38.801
Someone said they're going to call you back in your probation officer's calling

668
00:42:38.841 --> 00:42:43.040
you asking you why you don't have a job.
Your kids,

669
00:42:43.041 --> 00:42:46.790
mom or dad is screaming at you about not paying your bills.

670
00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:51.950
You're living with your family and they're telling you how you're a loser and

671
00:42:51.951 --> 00:42:56.510
how you're not going to work and then you're turning around and you're looking

672
00:42:56.511 --> 00:43:01.250
at the world in how does the world see you with your hands up,

673
00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:04.700
right?
You're vulnerable right now.

674
00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:08.600
Your hands are up because it shows that you're giving up.

675
00:43:09.590 --> 00:43:14.590
If we don't work together to change our society and help defy,

676
00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:19.280
this is how we will be.
Some day we're having,

677
00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:24.340
our hands are going to be up and there's going to be someone at the business end

678
00:43:24.471 --> 00:43:29.360
of a handgun or a knife and they're going to be trying to take what we worked so

679
00:43:29.361 --> 00:43:34.361
hard to kid because they felt like this that morning and they got sick of it.

680
00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:42.020
We as a society need to get sick of people walking around with their hands in

681
00:43:42.021 --> 00:43:42.854
the air.

682
00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:48.550
We have to decide that we as a community can work together to bring our hands

683
00:43:50.121 --> 00:43:50.954
down.

684
00:43:54.970 --> 00:43:56.980
This is not about a handout.

685
00:43:58.870 --> 00:44:01.030
This is about a hand up.

686
00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:07.500
It's about you being in a position to change someone else's life with something

687
00:44:09.881 --> 00:44:11.950
as simple as your time.

688
00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:17.860
Simply listening to someone's story and saying,
Hey,

689
00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:22.570
I can't promise you that you're going to get a job at Google,
right?

690
00:44:23.770 --> 00:44:27.490
I can't promise you that you'll be a millionaire in five years,

691
00:44:27.491 --> 00:44:29.140
but you know what I can do for you.

692
00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:34.980
I can help you make a better decision so that you and I aren't talking inside of

693
00:44:36.181 --> 00:44:40.260
a prison.
That's what you can do.

694
00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:45.240
You can write a check.
That's true too.
You can,

695
00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:49.860
I can just simply pay the problem away,
right?

696
00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:56.460
And you can leave it on the shoulders of busy and Stacy and Bob and the

697
00:44:56.461 --> 00:45:00.360
correctional folks here to take the money and try to do some good with it.

698
00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:02.820
That works too.

699
00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:08.230
But is that a solution to a longterm problem?

700
00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:14.690
You guys deal with code and complex algorithms every day,

701
00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:18.050
right?
I know.
I pay y'all.
We Google ad words.

702
00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:22.910
I pay you for that and you guys work.
You're very welcome.

703
00:45:22.911 --> 00:45:27.140
I paid for all of this.
Just so you know,

704
00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:31.010
right this account brother hear me,

705
00:45:34.330 --> 00:45:37.880
but imagine how complex it is

706
00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:44.560
not having this.
I'm not trying to guilt you into anything.

707
00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:46.690
I'm trying to get you to step back and say,

708
00:45:46.691 --> 00:45:50.620
we as a society have to decide when enough is enough.

709
00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:56.530
5% of the world's population,
yet 20% of them are incarcerated.

710
00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:02.030
We've turned
punishment into a business

711
00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:05.300
and business is good.

712
00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:09.750
Is this who we are?

713
00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:17.170
We define who we are by simply taking an opportunity to reach out to somebody

714
00:46:18.321 --> 00:46:22.580
else.
If it's just your time,
if you're more comfortable with the money,

715
00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:27.740
if you're more comfortable with a mentorship,
all of this is needed by the Fi.

716
00:46:29.090 --> 00:46:32.150
Each one of you in this room have the power to do something.

717
00:46:32.690 --> 00:46:36.500
No matter how small you think it is and all.

718
00:46:36.501 --> 00:46:40.820
I'm asking you as somebody whose brother was blessed enough to be part of this,

719
00:46:41.570 --> 00:46:46.370
please.
I'm asking from my brother,

720
00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:51.080
for my mother,
my father,
and for every person that is not here,
please,

721
00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:56.120
you can change our lives.

722
00:46:57.890 --> 00:47:00.680
And all we're asking is please,

723
00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:03.930
I have nothing else to say.

724
00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:08.770
<v 0>We're going to end it right there.
That was incredibly well said.
Travis,</v>

725
00:47:08.771 --> 00:47:10.780
thank you very much for that.
Let's give our panelists around.
Yeah,

726
00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:11.743
<v 1>pause</v>

727
00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:19.870
<v 0>now.
We'll open it up to questions from the audience.
Anybody have a question?</v>

728
00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:22.190
Um,
I was just wondering,

729
00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:26.760
you talked a little bit about what some of the roles that volunteers have.
Um,

730
00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:30.490
but I was curious if you could give a little more an idea of what kinds of roles

731
00:47:30.491 --> 00:47:32.790
and opportunities there are in terms of volunteering and,

732
00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:35.580
and what you would do in those roles.
Sure.

733
00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:37.930
<v 3>Do you want me to answer?
Yeah,
why don't you take,</v>

734
00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:43.260
so volunteers have several opportunities to come into the facilities with us.

735
00:47:44.410 --> 00:47:44.860
Um,

736
00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:49.860
we have three big events throughout the eight month program that focused mostly

737
00:47:50.621 --> 00:47:54.970
on Empathy Building and coaching on deliverables that they all create as a

738
00:47:54.971 --> 00:47:57.760
result of the program.
So those are,

739
00:47:58.090 --> 00:48:00.140
we have a one to one ratio those days.

740
00:48:00.141 --> 00:48:03.580
So if we have 40 e I t s we'd have 40 volunteers come in.

741
00:48:03.850 --> 00:48:05.680
And if I was your Eit,

742
00:48:05.681 --> 00:48:10.681
I would show you my resume and you would give me coaching on how to better craft

743
00:48:10.721 --> 00:48:13.090
my resume.
Right?
Um,

744
00:48:13.091 --> 00:48:16.570
so those days are very structured and everyone's getting feedback on the same

745
00:48:16.571 --> 00:48:19.840
deliverables.
Then we have our weekly classroom sessions,

746
00:48:19.841 --> 00:48:23.290
which are every Tuesday at both Arkansas Valley correctional facility in car to

747
00:48:23.291 --> 00:48:25.080
state penitentiary.
Um,

748
00:48:25.110 --> 00:48:28.960
there are two and a half hours long and people come in and go over a variety of

749
00:48:28.961 --> 00:48:31.780
different topics.
Um,
I always have volunteers say to me,

750
00:48:31.781 --> 00:48:35.140
I'd like to come in and observe a class.
There's no such thing.

751
00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:39.280
You get thrown right into it and have some of the most impactful,

752
00:48:39.281 --> 00:48:42.520
very cool conversations.
Um,

753
00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:44.870
<v 1>okay.</v>

754
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:49.520
<v 3>The other is with our alumni groups.
So specifically if we talk about Travis,</v>

755
00:48:49.521 --> 00:48:51.020
his brother Darious,
um,

756
00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:54.860
we have a lot of the guys who have longer or even life sentences who graduated

757
00:48:54.861 --> 00:48:58.520
from our first cohort but are still very committed to change and transformation.

758
00:48:58.790 --> 00:49:02.090
So we've put together an alumni program,
um,

759
00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:05.630
where we continued to provide them kind of like think of it as like elective

760
00:49:05.631 --> 00:49:09.770
courses where if you guys wanted to put together a presentation to show them,

761
00:49:10.010 --> 00:49:14.630
I would set up the day and the time and I would call Bob and ask him to get me a

762
00:49:14.631 --> 00:49:19.430
room and we bring all the alumni and bring in the volunteers and kind of create

763
00:49:19.431 --> 00:49:23.870
something new which,
um,
oozy media actually did for us.
Um,

764
00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:28.040
Travis is company,
so go dance has gone right there.
Gil,
Gil,

765
00:49:28.041 --> 00:49:28.940
Gil and Travis.

766
00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:31.420
<v 0>I think the other part,</v>

767
00:49:31.421 --> 00:49:35.270
cause we've talked primarily today about the in prison program.

768
00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:38.060
Obviously Stacy hit on that inside out model,

769
00:49:38.570 --> 00:49:40.960
but the aspect of the outside pieces,

770
00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:44.780
the post release program and graduates who are coming back out into the

771
00:49:44.781 --> 00:49:48.170
community,
Ronnie being one,
you know,

772
00:49:48.171 --> 00:49:51.380
and having starting to run corporate workshops,

773
00:49:51.381 --> 00:49:56.381
starting to run mentorships in the community to continue on that path of

774
00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:01.100
assisting on entrepreneurship path,

775
00:50:01.101 --> 00:50:05.090
assisting on life skills and that sort of thing.
And so,
you know,
it's,

776
00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:09.920
it's certainly largely in prison right now,
but also out in the community,

777
00:50:09.921 --> 00:50:14.060
there is a variety of opportunities as well.
Bob,
can I just jump in real quick?

778
00:50:14.090 --> 00:50:16.350
Yeah,
I would just say,
um,

779
00:50:17.570 --> 00:50:19.880
if you're wondering whether you're

780
00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:21.070
<v 1>okay</v>

781
00:50:21.070 --> 00:50:26.070
<v 0>qualified to help or you would be good to help if this resonated with you at</v>

782
00:50:27.171 --> 00:50:28.004
all,

783
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:33.430
<v 5>then you're totally qualified and you will be really good and you will think of</v>

784
00:50:34.221 --> 00:50:38.360
it.
Maybe it's going in for a volunteer opportunity and you giving,

785
00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:42.740
but I promise you,
you will get so much more back.

786
00:50:42.741 --> 00:50:45.380
And I know that's trite and Cliche,
but I,

787
00:50:46.850 --> 00:50:50.090
I probably spend four or five days after prison.

788
00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:55.220
I'm just processing,
just processing all the conversations I've had,

789
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:57.980
processing what I've learned about people processing,

790
00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:02.940
putting my life in sort of a different perspective.
Um,
yeah,
it's,

791
00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:04.760
it's a great deal of these jump on it.

792
00:51:05.070 --> 00:51:06.720
<v 0>You know,
that,
that,
that's an arrestee point.</v>

793
00:51:06.721 --> 00:51:11.460
I just want to jump back in because we,
we have as a program,
we have,

794
00:51:11.461 --> 00:51:14.490
we have two requirements for anybody who wants to come into our program or

795
00:51:14.491 --> 00:51:14.851
prison.

796
00:51:14.851 --> 00:51:18.000
And we have two requirements for any volunteer and anybody who wants to come

797
00:51:18.001 --> 00:51:21.370
into our program,
when we go into a new prison,
I stand in front of them.

798
00:51:21.371 --> 00:51:24.330
When I say we don't work with criminals,

799
00:51:24.810 --> 00:51:28.560
we work with people who've done some bad stuff and we don't work with slackers.

800
00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:30.510
And if you meet both of those boxes,

801
00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:35.010
then you're welcome to come into the program.
And for volunteers,
the,
you know,

802
00:51:35.011 --> 00:51:39.390
the,
the,
the numerous that I meet and talk to,
there's only two requirements.

803
00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:43.110
One is showing up,
showing up is half the ballgame here.

804
00:51:43.410 --> 00:51:47.670
And the other thing is coming in with an open mindset and I think it's back to

805
00:51:47.671 --> 00:51:50.550
your point time.
If you're willing to come in with that open mindset,

806
00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:54.000
that's where the interaction takes over.

807
00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:59.420
<v 6>Can I just say something real quick?
Um,
how about coming in?
You,
you know,</v>

808
00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:04.010
we're all human beings so we relate to each other in different ways.
You know,

809
00:52:04.011 --> 00:52:07.110
it's not about being poor or rich or whatever,
you know,

810
00:52:07.111 --> 00:52:11.120
and it's about being a human being.
Um,
you never know who you're gonna run into,

811
00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:15.500
who one word could actually change your perspective.
You know,

812
00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:19.920
I come from the streets and um,
you know,
my life was on the curves,

813
00:52:19.921 --> 00:52:23.000
sound dope or doing whatever and you know,

814
00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:25.970
with the Phi and you know,
the path that I was taking,

815
00:52:25.971 --> 00:52:29.810
they absolutely helped me stand on that same curve just like this from the

816
00:52:29.811 --> 00:52:34.250
streets,
looking at the streets and say,
hey,
you know,
turn around.

817
00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:35.713
And when I turned around,

818
00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:39.230
I seen the rest of the world and like how I want to be a part of that.

819
00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:44.860
And maybe somebody who you talked to in prison or whatever you guys could do,

820
00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:48.561
you know,

821
00:52:48.561 --> 00:52:53.090
you guys might just be the one to change that one person who nobody could

822
00:52:53.091 --> 00:52:56.690
thought it would be changed and let them see the rest of the world from that

823
00:52:56.691 --> 00:53:01.650
same curve.
That's the best thing you've asked you to do it.

824
00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:02.990
That's great.

825
00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:05.940
<v 0>I think we had a question over here.
Your courage and your end</v>

826
00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:10.450
<v 8>did the archer madness and I feel it and I think most of this room feel it.</v>

827
00:53:10.510 --> 00:53:11.343
I think

828
00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:13.610
<v 6>people who work at Google</v>

829
00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:18.220
<v 8>tend to have that in there.
It is part of our hiring criteria.</v>

830
00:53:18.730 --> 00:53:23.730
There's a Google enos hiring criteria that we often get through and we can sense

831
00:53:23.951 --> 00:53:27.940
that empathy in others as well.
Uh,
that said,

832
00:53:28.110 --> 00:53:30.440
what I wanted to ask really is,
uh,

833
00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:36.080
how many of your graduates of the program actually come back and volunteer then

834
00:53:37.410 --> 00:53:40.510
I'm very curious about that.
And also,
uh,

835
00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:44.820
Trevor was it who meet Travis?
Travis.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It can be.
Trevor,

836
00:53:44.821 --> 00:53:47.640
if you give me a discount on that brother.
I got your,

837
00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:53.040
I got your ad words optimization all the writing.
I can help you with that.

838
00:53:53.250 --> 00:53:54.083
Yeah.

839
00:53:56.270 --> 00:53:59.570
<v 0>Um,
on the first question,
I'll,
I'll jump in on that.</v>

840
00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:04.600
So I'm in Nebraska and in California,

841
00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:08.300
um,
other defy states,
there's actually,

842
00:54:08.301 --> 00:54:11.240
it is the work for those chapters that have come back.

843
00:54:11.241 --> 00:54:16.241
So that's taking volunteering to the utmost level from that standpoint here in

844
00:54:16.401 --> 00:54:19.580
Colorado.
Um,
Ronnie came with us.

845
00:54:19.581 --> 00:54:21.710
We did a radio show a couple of weeks ago when Ryan,

846
00:54:21.711 --> 00:54:23.570
he was with us two weeks ago.

847
00:54:23.571 --> 00:54:28.571
We made a presentation to about 150 people in the community corrections industry

848
00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:30.930
in Colorado.

849
00:54:30.931 --> 00:54:35.490
And we brought another one of our graduates on Damien with us.
And Yeah.

850
00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:36.820
<v 1>Okay.</v>

851
00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:39.880
<v 0>You know,
Brandon and Bob could talk about this more,</v>

852
00:54:39.881 --> 00:54:44.410
but this was all people who run the community corrections across Colorado,

853
00:54:44.890 --> 00:54:47.440
the halfway houses,
the other facilities.

854
00:54:48.070 --> 00:54:50.140
And they came up to us afterwards and they said,

855
00:54:50.620 --> 00:54:54.190
we've never had somebody come back in

856
00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:55.590
<v 1>okay.</v>

857
00:54:55.590 --> 00:54:58.170
<v 0>And present and they just couldn't believe it.</v>

858
00:54:58.171 --> 00:55:02.300
They were just baffled by the fact that Damien,
um,

859
00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:06.270
was willing to come in and was willing to stand up there and be part of our

860
00:55:06.271 --> 00:55:10.850
presentation and do the Q and a.
And so for us,
it's,
you know,

861
00:55:10.890 --> 00:55:15.330
for us that's a key tenant of the overall program is to continue to pay it

862
00:55:15.331 --> 00:55:16.164
forward.

863
00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:17.030
<v 1>Okay.</v>

864
00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:19.630
<v 0>I had one final one,
if we have time that's there.
I,</v>

865
00:55:19.631 --> 00:55:22.160
I'd like Brian puts you on the spot a little bit,

866
00:55:22.161 --> 00:55:26.300
but we talked about one of the tenants of the defy ventures Colorado program is

867
00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:27.470
<v 1>okay,</v>

868
00:55:27.470 --> 00:55:31.220
<v 0>business ideation.
You have to develop a business,
you have to pitch a business.</v>

869
00:55:31.550 --> 00:55:34.770
In fact,
it's a requirement to graduate,
um,

870
00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:38.480
to pitch a for profit business at a former business pitch competition.

871
00:55:39.380 --> 00:55:42.170
What was your business idea and tell us a little bit about it.

872
00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:47.510
<v 6>My business idea was a taco truck.
Um,
I know it's,
you know,</v>

873
00:55:47.511 --> 00:55:49.520
Denver is saturated with them,

874
00:55:49.550 --> 00:55:52.550
but why Taco truck has he on the Meos?

875
00:55:55.820 --> 00:55:56.490
<v 8>I feel like</v>

876
00:55:56.490 --> 00:56:00.510
<v 6>the name alone is going to be catchy enough to go along with the quality of food</v>

877
00:56:00.511 --> 00:56:03.870
that I'm not going to produce.
This can be authentic Latin cuisine.
Uh,

878
00:56:03.871 --> 00:56:05.870
Barbacoa Tacos,
Tacos,
history chair.

879
00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:10.500
That was a line where a real authentic Mexican food land food,

880
00:56:10.770 --> 00:56:14.530
um,
with a drink and some chips or whatever.
Um,

881
00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:17.580
it's going to cost me about $7,300 to get,
you know,

882
00:56:17.650 --> 00:56:21.080
to purchase a used car to grill is a freezer.
Um,

883
00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:23.320
I have this idea that,
um,

884
00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:27.570
going to a candy painted up and make it appealing to the eye.
I want to park it.

885
00:56:27.730 --> 00:56:28.151
You know,

886
00:56:28.151 --> 00:56:31.000
I'm going to focus on the nightlife in downtown Denver because you know,

887
00:56:31.001 --> 00:56:34.660
when everybody gets out of the clubs are from going out,
you know,

888
00:56:34.661 --> 00:56:39.250
everybody wants to go and get something to eat and everybody's trying to get

889
00:56:39.251 --> 00:56:42.700
pushed out of the clubs and people want to interact with each other and figure

890
00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:45.010
out what's going on next.
So,
you know,

891
00:56:45.011 --> 00:56:50.011
I have this vision of a Yummy yummy on truck with some really good food on the

892
00:56:50.861 --> 00:56:55.180
grill with some music still plan,
kind of keep it going a little bit afterwards.

893
00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:56.513
Um,

894
00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:01.800
and my plates are going to be like anywhere between like eight and $11 for a

895
00:57:01.810 --> 00:57:05.500
plate of like three to five Tacos,
depending on what you get drinks.

896
00:57:05.501 --> 00:57:09.970
We're going to be like dollar $52 extra.
Um,
seventh,

897
00:57:10.010 --> 00:57:13.120
$300 is the truck,
or excuse me,

898
00:57:13.121 --> 00:57:15.790
the trailer first month inventory,

899
00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:18.170
licensing and permits and paint job parts.

900
00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:22.930
You get a screen wrapped and the employees,
my employees will,

901
00:57:23.590 --> 00:57:25.150
I will pay them just a hundred dollars a day.

902
00:57:25.151 --> 00:57:30.010
They'll have to pay their own taxes.
But um,
yeah,
come in,
come.

903
00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:32.770
And soon,
actually next summer I'd get out of the halfway house this summer.

904
00:57:33.250 --> 00:57:38.250
So I'm going to have a whole year to work on saving the 7,300 and I plan on

905
00:57:39.971 --> 00:57:44.720
launching Cinco de mio next year.
Um,
I'll have my first yum,
yum,

906
00:57:44.750 --> 00:57:48.550
yum truck.
Like it's going to be official.
I'm going to do merchandising,

907
00:57:48.551 --> 00:57:52.000
everything.
Know me.
I'm the,
I'm sure it's everything.
Um,

908
00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:55.150
because you know,
when you guys are hungry and stuff,

909
00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:58.600
you guys thinking about what to eat or you're going to be like,
what's,

910
00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:03.020

You want Mexican?
Oh,

Yummy.
Yum,

911
00:58:03.030 --> 00:58:04.420
So we had these Tacos,

912
00:58:05.220 --> 00:58:09.600
<v 0>so there we go.
If we have anybody in the audience or anybody watching who,

business off the ground,
