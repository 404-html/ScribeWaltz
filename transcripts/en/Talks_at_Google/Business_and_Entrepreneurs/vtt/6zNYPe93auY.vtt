00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.750
Have you on.
Welcome to toxic Google.
Thanks for much for joining us today.

2
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.340
It's my pleasure to welcome Sarah Robb O'hagan to the office to talk about her

3
00:00:14.341 --> 00:00:19.050
new book,
extreme.
You step up,
stand out,
kick ass.
Repeat the book.

4
00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:23.550
Not only inspires you to take risks and step out of the box,
but it's also funny,

5
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.750
entertaining and super interesting as she takes you through her own personal

6
00:00:27.751 --> 00:00:31.740
journey of success and failure and how they have got her to where she is today.

7
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.150
Please join me in welcoming her.

8
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.640
Good morning Googlers.
How is everyone ready to rock it out?

9
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.860
All right,
so I generally like to,
um,

10
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.740
start my talks with just a little bit of context.
Where's the crazy accent from?

11
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.340
I am from New Zealand.
Does anyone ever been there in the room?

12
00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.230
There's always one.
There's two.
Is it amazing?
It's kind of amazing.

13
00:01:01.231 --> 00:01:03.470
So it is like,
it's,

14
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.990
it was discovered in 1769 actually by captain James Cook,

15
00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:09.960
who wrote in his log book.
I believe I had found God zone.
I mean,

16
00:01:09.961 --> 00:01:13.020
I'm not even kidding.
It's the most gorgeous place on the planet.

17
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.900
So why would I leave New Zealand's you wonder,

18
00:01:15.901 --> 00:01:19.860
well there's like 4 million people and almost 50 million sheep.

19
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.920
Let's just start there.
That is not like a joke.

20
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.060
That is exactly what my country looks like.
So as a young person growing up,

21
00:01:27.061 --> 00:01:29.340
you can imagine I had a lot of like,

22
00:01:29.341 --> 00:01:32.880
well is this it like is this my people or is there more than the world?

23
00:01:32.881 --> 00:01:37.881
Like how do we go beyond a New Zealand is also a country that is very passionate

24
00:01:39.601 --> 00:01:44.010
about sports.
I loved that.
I'd got my crew team in the back row here today.

25
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.790
So like Americans were really into sport in America.

26
00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:52.791
Well in New Zealand we're a little country but we like swing hard and the 1984

27
00:01:53.191 --> 00:01:53.701
Olympics,

28
00:01:53.701 --> 00:01:56.250
which most of you probably can't even remember because you weren't born.

29
00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.850
I was like a 12 year old watching on TV as we got the most metals we've ever won

30
00:02:02.431 --> 00:02:07.430
and our history and that was 12 medals you guys,
it's amazing.
Like twice.

31
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.770
Like we were number one on the global per capita metals table.

32
00:02:10.771 --> 00:02:11.910
That's a big deal to us.

33
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.330
But what's really cool about it is every middle that we one involved a sport

34
00:02:17.581 --> 00:02:21.690
where they were sitting down.
Isn't that amazing?

35
00:02:21.691 --> 00:02:25.920
Look at the pictures.
Like literally cycling,
rowing,
Kayaking,

36
00:02:25.921 --> 00:02:30.410
horse riding.
I could go on like we crushed it at the sports that involve,

37
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.590
who would've thought?
Right?

38
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.340
So why am I sharing this funny story with you is because I do believe as a young

39
00:02:37.531 --> 00:02:41.160
person growing up,
it did leave quite a profound thought with me.

40
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:46.161
And that is that it takes extreme focus to achieve extraordinary results like

41
00:02:46.231 --> 00:02:48.240
those little kiwis punching above their weight.

42
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.490
You have to really have focus on something that is your unique specialty.

43
00:02:53.491 --> 00:02:55.620
And you'll see in the pictures here,

44
00:02:55.621 --> 00:03:00.190
I've had the great pleasure of working for some of the world's most brands,

45
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.170
<v 2>sustaining amazing brands.</v>

46
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.470
And what they all have in common is this detailed,

47
00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:09.640
detailed focus on what they are,
where they're going,
why they're unique,

48
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.730
and they don't get distracted.
As the years go by and it's,

49
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.070
it's specially important when the landscape is so rapidly changing.

50
00:03:18.071 --> 00:03:20.530
And for me being someone who's gone,

51
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.170
everything from virgin mega stores,

52
00:03:23.171 --> 00:03:27.460
does anyone even remember virgin mega stores when the music industry got

53
00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:31.570
disrupted and that company no longer exists through to the likes of Nike,

54
00:03:31.571 --> 00:03:35.200
which is driving innovation and pushing forward more than any other company in

55
00:03:35.201 --> 00:03:39.550
the world.
The big difference is those that consistently play their own game,

56
00:03:39.551 --> 00:03:43.330
but just stay in front and disrupt themselves before the industry does it to

57
00:03:43.331 --> 00:03:44.164
them.

58
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.060
So I've had these great career experiences and the process of writing my book

59
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:50.500
led me to say,
well,

60
00:03:50.501 --> 00:03:54.340
what does this actually mean for individuals as well and and leaders.

61
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.270
And you can see here I,
over the last three years it's been,

62
00:03:58.271 --> 00:04:02.920
I have interviewed 25 of some of the most profoundly successful people on the

63
00:04:02.921 --> 00:04:05.770
planet because I wanted to know just like those brands,

64
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.540
what is it about them that uniquely enables them to stay on the top of their

65
00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:11.290
game?

66
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.180
And what I did is I went to great lengths to sort of go to all walks of life.

67
00:04:16.181 --> 00:04:18.190
So you see some of the pictures here,

68
00:04:18.191 --> 00:04:21.730
everyone from Condoleezza Rice who we all know who's like the world's most

69
00:04:21.731 --> 00:04:24.070
amazing,
bad us through to Bodie Miller,

70
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.560
who's a downhill skier through to Mr Cartoon,

71
00:04:26.561 --> 00:04:29.920
who's one of the world's most famous tattoo artists,
Sam Kass,

72
00:04:29.921 --> 00:04:30.754
the White House chef.

73
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.030
What they all have in common is this incredible ability to know their own

74
00:04:36.101 --> 00:04:38.290
specialties,
to know what they're amazing at,

75
00:04:38.291 --> 00:04:43.291
to focus like those little kiwis and to constantly disrupt themselves whenever

76
00:04:43.751 --> 00:04:48.730
they get to mastery,
push themselves to the next level.
So with that said,

77
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.350
I think about this framework that I've been developing and discovering,

78
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.340
and it starts with you,
the person,
like those individuals I just talked about.

79
00:04:57.341 --> 00:04:58.570
What is extreme you?

80
00:04:58.571 --> 00:05:03.040
What is you at your most optimum potential?

81
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.430
Like what is the core set of skills that you have?
And generally extremists,

82
00:05:07.431 --> 00:05:09.300
as I call them,
are not well rounded.

83
00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.420
They're not the kinds of people that have tons of experience and a lot of
places,

84
00:05:13.421 --> 00:05:17.230
they're probably super good at one specialty and really passionate about it and

85
00:05:17.231 --> 00:05:19.210
we love them.
And the workplace,

86
00:05:19.211 --> 00:05:23.350
however they need to be partnered with complimentary people to become extreme

87
00:05:23.351 --> 00:05:27.070
teams like when we get lots of complimentary skills together.

88
00:05:27.071 --> 00:05:32.071
And then ultimately the extreme organization is that organization that is loaded

89
00:05:32.501 --> 00:05:36.040
with people with incredible skills and specialist areas.

90
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.880
But together they come together and focus on a really,

91
00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:42.850
really focused mission.
So with that said,

92
00:05:42.851 --> 00:05:47.830
I'm going to go through three examples today of the kind of key tenants that I

93
00:05:47.831 --> 00:05:51.610
learned from all these amazing businesses and all these amazing leaders in

94
00:05:51.611 --> 00:05:54.250
developing the idea that was extreme year.

95
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.490
And the first one is what I like to call,
make failure your fuel.

96
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.030
It is possibly my most favorite topic in the world.
Um,

97
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:06.770
and it starts with the fact that I,
um,
had had a career,

98
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.170
mainly a in the sports and fitness industry.

99
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.720
If you googled me a couple of years ago,

100
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.690
what you would have seen is that I was known for turning around Gatorade,

101
00:06:14.691 --> 00:06:16.730
a $5 billion sports drink business.

102
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.360
I had all these things like fast company's most creative people in business.

103
00:06:20.361 --> 00:06:21.470
That looks amazing,
right?

104
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.780
But what it totally left out was the fact that in my twenties,
I got fired.

105
00:06:26.781 --> 00:06:29.240
Not once,
but twice back to back.

106
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:35.020
And I like to share the story because I believe in our culture today of success,

107
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.190
whether it's lists of the 40 under 40,
30,
under 30,
20,
under 20,

108
00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:42.680
whether it's perfectly quaffed Instagram pictures,

109
00:06:42.681 --> 00:06:47.300
we tend to show all the amazing stuff and we don't tend to show some of the

110
00:06:47.301 --> 00:06:49.130
really embarrassing,
not so cool stuff.

111
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:53.470
So one of the reasons I wrote this book was I felt it was important to share a,

112
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.980
particularly with young people that you have to fail in order to know who you

113
00:06:57.981 --> 00:07:02.630
are and in order to succeed in the future.
My example of virgin,
like I mentioned,

114
00:07:02.631 --> 00:07:06.230
was virgin mega stores.
I joined,
uh,
in the late nineties,

115
00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:10.700
the year Napster had come along.
So let's just go there.
Remember that?

116
00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:12.730
I still remember that,

117
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:17.120
like how big moment it was may and we had to like comp Ricky Martin's album

118
00:07:17.121 --> 00:07:21.920
sales from the year before.
Like that's how awesome it was.
But in the end,

119
00:07:21.921 --> 00:07:26.000
the company actually went under for all the reasons I said before because they

120
00:07:26.001 --> 00:07:29.330
were being disrupted from outside and not taking care of themselves.

121
00:07:29.331 --> 00:07:34.331
But my experience was someone who'd come in from a high flying role at Virgin

122
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.900
Atlantic Airways.
I thought I had it down.
I was like rocking and rolling,

123
00:07:38.901 --> 00:07:43.240
not listening to anyone around me at a totally foreign business,
so over my skis.

124
00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:45.740
So arrogant and I got fired.

125
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:49.760
Not like laid off one person hired.

126
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:52.070
And let me explain to you what that feels like.

127
00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:56.300
When you go into the office and HR is sitting there and you feel a blood rush

128
00:07:56.301 --> 00:08:01.301
out or your face and you get told that you have a one week severance,

129
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:05.030
they're getting rid of your green card application on your visa and you get a

130
00:08:05.031 --> 00:08:07.760
one way ticket back to New Zealand.
In other words,

131
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.580
we don't want you in our company,
we don't even want you in our country.

132
00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:11.990
Like that's how awesome it was.

133
00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:17.980
So I go through that and then desperate times call for desperate measures.

134
00:08:18.051 --> 00:08:22.010
I have three months to stay in the country and I ended up taking a job at Atari.

135
00:08:22.011 --> 00:08:25.580
Does anyone have this room?
Remember Tyrese and fond fans?
I would imagine,

136
00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:31.180
which was a disaster for me because I completely overlooked the fact that I

137
00:08:31.461 --> 00:08:34.940
cannot stand video games,
never have liked them,
have no interest in them,

138
00:08:34.941 --> 00:08:37.760
don't understand them.
Within two years,

139
00:08:37.761 --> 00:08:41.280
that's another company in distress and a bunch of people are getting laid off in

140
00:08:41.281 --> 00:08:44.570
a course.
I'm one of them.
So by this stage,

141
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:49.720
I'm now in my late twenties I've had up to four years of epic Korea failure,

142
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:54.830
right?
Disastrous.
Like I call it fondly my canyon of Korea despair.

143
00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:57.420
It was terrible.
But here's the thing,

144
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:02.600
that same person that was a total flame out and these two environments,

145
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:04.740
eventually after I leave Atari,

146
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.740
I'm desperately trying to find the right role for me going forward.

147
00:09:07.741 --> 00:09:12.741
I finally land at Nike after 12 months of interviewing and trying and getting in

148
00:09:12.811 --> 00:09:17.700
the door,
and that same loser girl suddenly becomes on the fast track,

149
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.010
having a great career rocking and rolling.
Right.

150
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:25.640
And the lesson here for me was you have to experience extreme environments to

151
00:09:25.921 --> 00:09:28.410
understand where you suck and where you thrive.

152
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:31.740
And when you get yourself onto the playing field where you thrive,

153
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:36.420
it feels amazing and you know,
the difference in all your confidence comes back.

154
00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:40.110
And that is the importance of failure on the way to success.

155
00:09:40.111 --> 00:09:41.340
Because quite honestly,

156
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:45.480
had I not just come through those two back to back firings,

157
00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:49.500
I don't think I would've had the humility coming in the door to succeed at Nike.

158
00:09:49.501 --> 00:09:52.350
I mean,
literally I walk in the door and I'm like,
please don't fire me.

159
00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:56.460
Please don't fire me.
I will do anything to do well here.

160
00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:01.440
And one of the great athletes that I had the pleasure of working with when I was

161
00:10:01.441 --> 00:10:05.190
at Nike was Bodie Miller.
Do you guys know Bodie?
He's awesome by the way.

162
00:10:05.191 --> 00:10:09.580
I mean the best skier in the world to watch because there is nothing between,
uh,

163
00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:14.340
like disqualified and goals.
Like that's just the way he rolls.

164
00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:18.540
But I,
uh,
really got to know him around the 2006 Torino Olympics.

165
00:10:18.541 --> 00:10:23.541
And he's extraordinary when you talk to him about failure because he talked

166
00:10:24.031 --> 00:10:27.720
about as a child when he was learning to ski in New Hampshire,

167
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:30.350
he physically was smaller than the other skiers.

168
00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:35.360
So he kept coming in like 30th 40th like certainly not podium potential.

169
00:10:35.401 --> 00:10:39.030
Right.
And the trainers kept saying to all of them,

170
00:10:39.031 --> 00:10:41.640
we've just got to kind of push yourself incrementally.

171
00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:44.760
That was the way they were training scares in those those days.
And he's like,

172
00:10:44.761 --> 00:10:48.540
well that ain't working for me clearly.
So finally he's like,

173
00:10:48.541 --> 00:10:51.180
I got to go my own way and figure this out.

174
00:10:51.181 --> 00:10:55.020
And he starts skiing and practice like balls to the wall.

175
00:10:55.021 --> 00:10:56.400
If anyone's watched the sky ski,

176
00:10:56.401 --> 00:11:01.401
there was no like holding back and he would crash a lot and it was painful.

177
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.140
But as he said,

178
00:11:04.141 --> 00:11:08.820
that was pushing him to the edge of his own boundaries is edge of his comfort

179
00:11:08.821 --> 00:11:13.821
level and teaching him to be able to eventually recover and those crashes to get

180
00:11:13.891 --> 00:11:14.640
to the next level.

181
00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:19.170
So on race day when the other guy suddenly go full steam ahead,
they're crashing.

182
00:11:19.171 --> 00:11:23.940
He actually now can push to a higher level because he's taught himself through

183
00:11:23.941 --> 00:11:28.470
the very act of crashing and failing and pain to get to the next level.

184
00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:33.210
So a great metaphor for all of us as we think about our own careers.

185
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:37.080
All right,
so that's making failure.

186
00:11:37.081 --> 00:11:42.030
Your fuel number two I like to talk about is playing.
You'll specialist game.

187
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:44.310
What does that mean for you personally?

188
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:49.620
So I came upon this idea from studying these great brands and businesses that

189
00:11:49.621 --> 00:11:51.510
I've been lucky enough to be involved with.

190
00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:55.780
And I'll pick out a few here just to share with you.
So Virgin Atlantic Airways,

191
00:11:55.781 --> 00:11:58.990
is anyone flown virgin?
Is that not awesome?

192
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:04.210
You get your hair done at the club house.
It's amazing.
But Virgin,

193
00:12:04.211 --> 00:12:08.350
super interesting to me because having spent about eight years in the airline

194
00:12:08.351 --> 00:12:12.670
industry,
most of you would know if you fly United or American,

195
00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.760
especially this week.
Uh,

196
00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:20.860
but their target audience is generally human beings with arms and legs,

197
00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:24.850
right?
You know what I'm saying?
Whereas Virgin when they came into the business,

198
00:12:24.851 --> 00:12:26.710
they're like,
we're not going after everyone.

199
00:12:26.711 --> 00:12:30.880
We're going to have this really defined position and we're going to focus on

200
00:12:30.881 --> 00:12:34.840
people who are into culture and technology and entertainment and fashion.

201
00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.390
Everything was built around that positioning.

202
00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:41.920
And as a result they built this incredible position as an airline.

203
00:12:41.921 --> 00:12:44.110
Like they think of the travel experience,

204
00:12:44.111 --> 00:12:46.420
I think more as entertainment than travel.

205
00:12:46.421 --> 00:12:50.290
I mean they even got to the point where they were able to sort of be an arbiter

206
00:12:50.291 --> 00:12:54.190
of great taste of movies and flight because they thought about it that way.

207
00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:57.880
Likewise,
Strava,
do I have any Strava users in the room?

208
00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:02.080
Can't believe that we've got to get you out onto your bike's guys.

209
00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:05.250
Strivers the social network for athletes that um,

210
00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:10.030
they're based out in silicon valley and what they do is obviously track runners,

211
00:13:10.031 --> 00:13:11.950
cycling,
all you sort of fitness activities.

212
00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:15.820
But as the founder said to me when I interviewed them for my book,

213
00:13:15.821 --> 00:13:17.470
like at the time they were born,

214
00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:21.610
the fitbit market was what everyone was going after cause it's big and as

215
00:13:21.611 --> 00:13:22.840
massive and they are like,

216
00:13:22.841 --> 00:13:26.650
well we could have done that but then we would have been number 10 and a giant

217
00:13:26.651 --> 00:13:31.480
market instead of they just went off to cyclists and only cyclists and they were

218
00:13:31.481 --> 00:13:33.250
number one for this really small group.

219
00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:37.060
And from there they've managed to push out because they're going after very,

220
00:13:37.061 --> 00:13:40.120
very passionate athletes.
And then lastly,

221
00:13:40.121 --> 00:13:43.930
the dry bar ladies in this room nodding.

222
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:48.430
The guys right now are going,
WTF,
what is driver?
They are,

223
00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:52.570
I could tell drive our is an extraordinary story.
I love it.

224
00:13:52.571 --> 00:13:55.000
I interviewed alley,
the founder for,

225
00:13:55.030 --> 00:14:00.030
for my book basically for many years hairdressing was certainly on the women's

226
00:14:01.151 --> 00:14:04.960
side.
You go to a hairdresser and anything you want to get done,
you get done.

227
00:14:04.961 --> 00:14:09.520
So cuts,
colors,
get your hair blown out.
Any of the above.

228
00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:12.250
Well Allie,
who founded the dry by was like,

229
00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:15.550
I really don't want to do all of that stuff.

230
00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:20.110
I'm just really good at blowing out here because I've loved doing it since I was

231
00:14:20.111 --> 00:14:24.610
a child and I want to create an entire concept just around that one thing.

232
00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.100
Now most people would say,

233
00:14:27.101 --> 00:14:30.670
how the hell are you going to build a business right around that one thing when

234
00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:34.090
women need all these other things done from a beauty standpoint as well,

235
00:14:34.091 --> 00:14:37.120
but she's like,
I'm going to be better than anyone at doing this one thing.

236
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.560
Sure enough,

237
00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:43.770
Drybar is now coming close to 100 million top line business based on the fact

238
00:14:43.871 --> 00:14:48.871
that she's created an entire category out of this one thing because women,

239
00:14:49.151 --> 00:14:53.210
we didn't used to rock along and spend five bucks for a blowout once or twice a

240
00:14:53.211 --> 00:14:55.430
week because the category didn't exist.

241
00:14:55.430 --> 00:15:00.430
She's now created it and as many obviously people following her and she gets so

242
00:15:01.461 --> 00:15:04.500
many people saying,
well,
why don't you add,
you know,

243
00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:08.450
makeup or nails or all the other things that women would want.
And she's like,

244
00:15:08.451 --> 00:15:11.600
because that would take away my focus from what I'm really,

245
00:15:11.601 --> 00:15:14.030
really good at and I want to be the best at this one thing.

246
00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:19.360
And it's such a great lesson because when you take all of those brands lessons

247
00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.340
and then think about yourself as an individual,

248
00:15:22.341 --> 00:15:26.450
how do you think about yourself being positioned like a brand would be?

249
00:15:26.451 --> 00:15:30.800
How do you think about your career in terms of imagining that you are that

250
00:15:30.801 --> 00:15:35.060
product in the marketplace that you're trying to attract people to come by?

251
00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:39.980
Do you feel just like those three examples that you are super uniquely

252
00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:41.120
differentiated?

253
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:46.880
Do you feel like the airline example that you're just trying to be all things to

254
00:15:46.881 --> 00:15:50.480
all people or do you have your one unique thing?
Do you feel like Allie,

255
00:15:50.481 --> 00:15:54.560
that you have that specialty that you really are better at than anyone else?

256
00:15:54.561 --> 00:15:58.340
Because I do believe when you have that and you become super world class,

257
00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:01.640
that is propels your career forward.

258
00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:04.490
So in my example,

259
00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:09.740
I actually spent most of my life being really,
really,
really average.

260
00:16:09.741 --> 00:16:14.690
So I'm talking really wanted to be a world class Olympic medal winning athlete.

261
00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:19.450
Never made the a team in any sport that I participated in at all.

262
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:22.560
Really wanted to be a world famous singer.

263
00:16:22.561 --> 00:16:25.700
I actress never got picked for Solos.
Actually,

264
00:16:25.701 --> 00:16:29.120
when we did grease at my high school,
I didn't even make the pink ladies.

265
00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:32.150
I was that section that doesn't go on the stage,
you know,

266
00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:36.530
clearly just not cut out to be really amazing and any of those things.

267
00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:39.260
However,
who would have thought?

268
00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:44.210
I didn't know 1520 years later when I finally had gone through all these trials

269
00:16:44.211 --> 00:16:49.040
and tribulations that what I actually was developing was this incredibly

270
00:16:49.041 --> 00:16:52.490
competitive mindset on probably the most competitive human being in the room

271
00:16:52.491 --> 00:16:56.180
right now,
combined with a very creative brain,

272
00:16:56.181 --> 00:17:00.560
developed through tons and tons of music combined with years of adventuring and

273
00:17:00.561 --> 00:17:01.460
the travel industry,

274
00:17:01.461 --> 00:17:06.290
which all comes together to make me uniquely good at innovation and the sports

275
00:17:06.291 --> 00:17:09.620
and fitness industry.
Who would have thought?
I didn't even know that was a Korea,

276
00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:13.730
but when I pulled those things together,
that's where I suddenly found,
wait,

277
00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.110
I'm not getting fired anymore.

278
00:17:15.111 --> 00:17:19.580
I've done it all together and it's interesting for all of you to understand what

279
00:17:19.581 --> 00:17:23.000
is that for you?
Because when you find it,

280
00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:26.900
when you know it,
when opportunity knocks,

281
00:17:26.901 --> 00:17:31.190
boy you have to knock down the door.
And in my case I uh,

282
00:17:31.191 --> 00:17:34.820
actually about six months ago was not working,

283
00:17:34.821 --> 00:17:37.910
not looking for a job cause I was working on the launch of this book.

284
00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:41.930
And along comes an opportunity with flywheel sports and I don't know if you guys

285
00:17:41.931 --> 00:17:45.050
are familiar with it,
I'll quickly tell you a little but about flywheel.

286
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:49.770
But it's unique because it's not just playing in the sports and industry.

287
00:17:49.771 --> 00:17:54.570
It's actually way into the specialty that I happened to be uniquely good at and

288
00:17:54.571 --> 00:17:55.404
passionate about.

289
00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:59.670
So if you think about the fitness industry right now,

290
00:17:59.671 --> 00:18:03.000
and this may be going on in many industries around the world,

291
00:18:03.001 --> 00:18:07.920
we are moving fast from one size fits all to specialist categories.

292
00:18:07.921 --> 00:18:08.970
This is really interesting.

293
00:18:08.971 --> 00:18:12.360
Like back in the 90s if you think about retail used to go to the department

294
00:18:12.361 --> 00:18:15.270
store and then we started going to boutique retail.

295
00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:17.100
The same thing is happening in fitness.

296
00:18:17.101 --> 00:18:19.680
So you see all these little boutiques popping up.

297
00:18:19.681 --> 00:18:23.250
I'm sure some of you in the room are attending them,
whether it's cycling,

298
00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:26.400
a little running boutiques,
bootcamp,
like Barry's bootcamp,

299
00:18:26.401 --> 00:18:30.960
if anyone's attended that Zoomba from a dance standpoint,
Yoga,

300
00:18:30.961 --> 00:18:34.530
all these little boutiques.
Now those feel very specialist.

301
00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:38.880
But interestingly,
even within the cycling category,

302
00:18:38.881 --> 00:18:41.460
you would think that in itself is a specialty.

303
00:18:41.461 --> 00:18:46.461
But actually there's three different kinds of approach to cycling as a category.

304
00:18:46.921 --> 00:18:47.580
So,

305
00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:52.290
so if you look at the kinds of people that are attracted into the boutique

306
00:18:52.291 --> 00:18:56.910
cycling world,
you have some that for whom it's a really social experience.

307
00:18:56.910 --> 00:19:00.390
The number one reason they're coming is to be social and hang out with your

308
00:19:00.391 --> 00:19:02.160
friends.
You have others,

309
00:19:02.161 --> 00:19:05.730
like my friend in the middle of the room here who attends flywheel,

310
00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:08.910
who probably were playing sports in high school,

311
00:19:08.911 --> 00:19:10.800
they're probably a little bit competitive.

312
00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:13.510
What I guess at that just a little bit.
Um,

313
00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:17.550
and they come for performance because they're trying to push their athletic

314
00:19:17.551 --> 00:19:19.920
performance to the next level.
And then lastly,

315
00:19:19.921 --> 00:19:24.921
we have people for whom routine is what gets them in the door to a fitness I'm

316
00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:28.800
offering because they don't love it.
It's not their lifestyle,

317
00:19:28.801 --> 00:19:29.910
but they know they have to do it.

318
00:19:29.911 --> 00:19:32.910
So they're just looking for what is the thing that is most convenient to where I

319
00:19:32.911 --> 00:19:33.630
live.

320
00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:38.310
Three different people with three completely different motivations around which

321
00:19:38.311 --> 00:19:40.500
to build,
uh,
a cycling business.

322
00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:46.050
So the notion here is to be spectacular for a few instead of being average for

323
00:19:46.051 --> 00:19:49.860
many.
I love this chart.
You will all be able to find yourselves on this chart.

324
00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:52.320
This is the u s population,
um,

325
00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:56.310
and everybody's attitudes to physical activity and fitness.

326
00:19:56.311 --> 00:19:57.780
So I will walk you through it.

327
00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:02.910
To your right is 30% of the population simply inactive.

328
00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:07.740
Totally don't work out at all.
They exist.
They're hard for me to understand,

329
00:20:07.741 --> 00:20:10.560
but they exist.
Um,
then we have 18%,

330
00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:14.760
which are what we call chore exercises for whom they really don't like fitness.

331
00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:17.910
The doctor told them to do it,
like it's not fun at all,

332
00:20:17.911 --> 00:20:22.260
but they do get out and push themselves.
Then you have hard workers,

333
00:20:22.261 --> 00:20:26.100
physical laborers obviously.
And then we get into the more active.

334
00:20:26.101 --> 00:20:28.890
So the social group I mentioned before,

335
00:20:28.891 --> 00:20:32.520
for whom it's a really social activity that they want to get out there.

336
00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:36.570
And then the routines as I mentioned,
and then these last two groups,

337
00:20:36.571 --> 00:20:41.040
passionate exercises and competitive athletes.
Now,
competitive athletes,

338
00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:46.250
15% of this population intellectually type as a competitive athlete,

339
00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.300
that means you cannot let your kids when a monopoly,

340
00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:53.560
that means wherever you are.
If you're on a treadmill next to someone,

341
00:20:53.561 --> 00:20:56.680
you are aware of the numbers and you are trying to go faster than you cannot

342
00:20:56.681 --> 00:20:57.310
help yourself.

343
00:20:57.310 --> 00:21:02.310
That is what a competitive athlete is and flywheel has completely attracted that

344
00:21:02.891 --> 00:21:06.610
one tiny segment because everything about our offering,

345
00:21:06.611 --> 00:21:09.040
we have technology so you can track your performance,

346
00:21:09.041 --> 00:21:11.260
compete with others in the room,
compete with yourself,

347
00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:16.330
and that is where we focus all our energy.
We don't try and go after all of it.

348
00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:21.010
We go after just one and I do believe as a business that makes us stronger and

349
00:21:21.011 --> 00:21:23.350
certainly as a leader I'm like,
I'm with my people.

350
00:21:23.351 --> 00:21:27.220
So I feel very comfortable intuitively with the decisions that I'm trying to

351
00:21:27.221 --> 00:21:31.900
make.
Okay.
That was your specialist's games.
And now lastly,

352
00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:35.260
I'm going to talk about breaking yourself to make yourself,

353
00:21:35.261 --> 00:21:37.810
which is an important lesson that I learned,

354
00:21:37.811 --> 00:21:42.490
particularly from the extreme as I interviewed that you can never get
complacent.

355
00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:46.270
So forsee that means breaking yourself as a leader.

356
00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:50.850
And I do believe having gone through the experience of being fired a couple of

357
00:21:50.851 --> 00:21:54.370
times,
it really sucks when it's done to you.

358
00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:58.120
It's a whole lot better to do it to yourself.

359
00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:03.040
And that means really recognizing when are you in your comfort zone?

360
00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:06.400
When have you been doing the same thing for awhile?
You've achieved mastery,

361
00:22:06.401 --> 00:22:07.450
you feel amazing.

362
00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:11.770
When is that time to push to a different place and get uncomfortable?

363
00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:12.940
Now my case,

364
00:22:12.941 --> 00:22:16.990
I actually quit my job a year ago to do just that because I was like,

365
00:22:16.991 --> 00:22:19.930
I knew I wasn't personally growing.

366
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:23.830
It was the scariest thing I've ever done in my life,
but my God,

367
00:22:23.831 --> 00:22:26.740
it's like I'd rather that than I didn't do it.

368
00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:30.700
A few years went by and I suddenly wasn't keeping up and I got laid off again.

369
00:22:30.701 --> 00:22:32.650
Right.
So what does that mean for you?

370
00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:37.930
Where is that moment in your career where you have to really push outside and

371
00:22:38.981 --> 00:22:42.220
it's involves challenging your most stubborn beliefs?

372
00:22:42.221 --> 00:22:47.050
I really have found from a lot of the research I've done that we do tend to in

373
00:22:47.051 --> 00:22:51.070
our minds get these kinds of beliefs early on in our career that we're not good

374
00:22:51.071 --> 00:22:52.060
at certain things,

375
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:57.220
that we are either an analytical person or a creative person or whatever the

376
00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:58.510
category might be.

377
00:22:58.511 --> 00:23:02.950
And we tend to often like those become our blind spots and we just don't kind of

378
00:23:02.951 --> 00:23:07.210
want to deal with them.
But actually you should deal with them and it's okay.

379
00:23:07.211 --> 00:23:12.211
That's breaking yourself down to make yourself like what is it that you are sort

380
00:23:12.401 --> 00:23:16.330
of avoiding and your job.
It isn't an area of decision making strength for you.

381
00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:21.670
Can you go and take an out of work class on it to really push yourself to the

382
00:23:21.671 --> 00:23:22.271
next level?

383
00:23:22.271 --> 00:23:25.390
Because that is the kind of thing it will feel uncomfortable but it will

384
00:23:25.391 --> 00:23:30.040
certainly get you there
and then break yourself as a business.

385
00:23:30.041 --> 00:23:31.420
So you've got to think as a leader,

386
00:23:31.421 --> 00:23:36.421
it is your responsibility to constantly get outside your comfort zone and learn

387
00:23:36.611 --> 00:23:38.890
new things.
But you also have to think as a business,

388
00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:41.170
what does that mean organizationally,

389
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:46.340
I had the great experience of working at Nike and then I'm leaving at around the

390
00:23:46.341 --> 00:23:51.320
time when the whole company was reorientating itself in terms of how they work

391
00:23:51.321 --> 00:23:55.430
together,
going from footwear apparel and equipment,
two categories,

392
00:23:55.431 --> 00:23:57.470
sucker running,
et cetera.

393
00:23:57.471 --> 00:24:02.471
And what that caused was all of the employees to move into a different place of

394
00:24:03.081 --> 00:24:05.660
how they were interacting with different people to innovate,

395
00:24:05.661 --> 00:24:07.670
which was actually incredibly uncomfortable,

396
00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:10.610
but obviously leads to new thinking and new innovation.

397
00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:12.260
So what does that mean for your teams?

398
00:24:12.261 --> 00:24:17.060
Can you get them into different train tracks in order to create new innovation

399
00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:20.780
and inspiration?
It's so important,
I believe,

400
00:24:20.781 --> 00:24:22.700
to look outside your category,

401
00:24:22.701 --> 00:24:26.450
to get inspiration for what you may do going forward.

402
00:24:26.451 --> 00:24:31.010
If I think about Strava,
like if we would just to stay in category,

403
00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:34.010
we'd be looking at Linkedin,
at Facebook,

404
00:24:34.011 --> 00:24:37.100
at all of the obvious social networking players and say,
well,

405
00:24:37.101 --> 00:24:39.770
let's do the same thing as them.
But guess what?

406
00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:44.890
Strivr is probably possibly one of the only silicon valley brands that people

407
00:24:44.991 --> 00:24:48.590
tattoo on their ankles because they are so passionate about it.

408
00:24:48.591 --> 00:24:52.550
So we need to look at the likes of Harley Davidson for inspiration.

409
00:24:52.551 --> 00:24:56.440
Not those other brands or in terms of an ad marketplace,

410
00:24:56.450 --> 00:25:00.680
were more relevant to look at the local cycling shop and how they are curating

411
00:25:00.681 --> 00:25:02.360
products for their passionate riders.

412
00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:06.320
The necessary a regular online ad marketplace.

413
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:10.250
So thinking about breaking yourself down and getting inspiration from other

414
00:25:10.251 --> 00:25:12.800
places.
And then lastly,

415
00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:18.860
apologies of putting that Disney song into your heads.
It's going to stay there.

416
00:25:18.861 --> 00:25:21.200
Now,
um,
let it go.

417
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:26.350
And what I mean by this is breaking yourself down by definition means letting go

418
00:25:26.991 --> 00:25:30.230
of things that I comfortable to you and it's not going to feel good.

419
00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:35.000
But what happens on the other side is always profound amounts of growth.

420
00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:39.200
I think about whether that means relocating to a different city because you got

421
00:25:39.201 --> 00:25:40.190
a job opportunity.

422
00:25:40.191 --> 00:25:43.820
Whether it means moving into a different department that you're uncomfortable

423
00:25:43.821 --> 00:25:47.900
with,
always you have to let go of something that was comfortable to get there.

424
00:25:47.901 --> 00:25:49.700
But always once you're through it,

425
00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:53.810
it's incredibly empowering in terms of how you grow.

426
00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:56.960
And I would say from all of the people I interviewed for my book,

427
00:25:56.990 --> 00:26:01.990
this was the one thing that really blew me away the most was that these were

428
00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:06.770
like massively accomplished people at the top of their game yet.

429
00:26:06.771 --> 00:26:10.790
So willing to be humble and take a step back and say,

430
00:26:10.791 --> 00:26:13.910
I'm going to start over and something because I want to learn more,

431
00:26:13.911 --> 00:26:16.760
which is a hard thing to do when you're already at the top of your game.

432
00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:19.640
So it is about letting go.

433
00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:25.100
And that's my three lessons for the day.
So making failure,
your fuel,

434
00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:28.850
knowing what your specialist's Gamers,
and then lastly,

435
00:26:28.851 --> 00:26:32.900
break yourself to make yourself,
to really push yourself to the next level.

436
00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:36.770
And so with that,
I think we have time for questions,

437
00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:41.120
I believe.
Well don't be shy.

438
00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:47.520
<v 0>Hi there.
So you started the,</v>

439
00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:49.680
the talk about how New Zealand,

440
00:26:49.681 --> 00:26:52.380
there's a big focus on exercise and outdoor activities.

441
00:26:52.381 --> 00:26:56.700
So do you think that maybe what didn't go well at Atari and some of the others

442
00:26:56.701 --> 00:26:58.980
where that even just the content of the job,

443
00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:03.450
like you had to work at a company where you had core values or passions?

444
00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:07.010
Definitely,
yeah,
I think passions,
um,

445
00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:10.400
and understanding because you are 100% right,

446
00:27:10.401 --> 00:27:15.290
like I can still remember being in this office in Santa Monica with this,

447
00:27:15.291 --> 00:27:17.630
is that Atari with a ton of,
um,

448
00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:21.230
the programming guys who would literally,

449
00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:26.260
they had zero interest in going outside into any part of the universe other than

450
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:30.200
working together.
And I found,
I was just like,
how is that possible?

451
00:27:30.201 --> 00:27:32.360
It's sunny outside.
We should all be going for a run.
You know,

452
00:27:32.361 --> 00:27:36.350
it's like it just was a total disconnect and I don't like,

453
00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.830
I don't judge that group of people,
that's their lifestyle,

454
00:27:39.831 --> 00:27:42.950
but I don't understand it.
I didn't have a connection to it.

455
00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:47.420
So I think it's important to not only have a passion for it,

456
00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:51.770
but when you do,
you have a lot more,
um,

457
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:55.100
just sheer confidence to make decisions and take risks.

458
00:27:55.101 --> 00:27:58.250
So in the case of video games,
you know,
you're faced with,

459
00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:02.420
should I do this or should I do that in picking which title we're going to get

460
00:28:02.421 --> 00:28:04.100
behind for the Christmas season?

461
00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:07.610
I don't know because I'm not that player yet.

462
00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:09.380
When I'm in suddenly Nike,

463
00:28:09.381 --> 00:28:12.800
it's like asking me questions about how an athlete's going to respond to

464
00:28:12.801 --> 00:28:15.410
something.
I'm like,
I got this because I lived it.
I know it.

465
00:28:15.411 --> 00:28:20.411
So I do think it is about the content but also your own just drive and passion

466
00:28:21.681 --> 00:28:22.514
to get behind it

467
00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:24.553
<v 3>for sure.</v>

468
00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:29.060
<v 0>Well thank you very much for your talk.
Um,</v>

469
00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:33.120
I love the point about really knowing what you're great at and like focusing and

470
00:28:33.121 --> 00:28:33.960
doubling down on that.

471
00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:36.030
And I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit more about,

472
00:28:36.031 --> 00:28:40.560
do you think about that as like a functional expertise and industry expertise

473
00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:42.360
type of organization to be a part of?

474
00:28:42.361 --> 00:28:45.630
Because I think what's interesting is you did many different things to different

475
00:28:45.631 --> 00:28:50.630
places.
So kind of what's the common thread between,
um,
you know,

476
00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:54.350
knowing,
knowing what you're really good at and what's the common thread between

477
00:28:54.351 --> 00:28:56.900
airlines,
music,
video games and sports.
You know,

478
00:28:57.850 --> 00:29:00.300
cause I think that is a great question.
And um,

479
00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:05.060
one of the things that I write about in the book is that I believe that the

480
00:29:05.061 --> 00:29:09.260
system is designed to make you fit in.
I think for most of us,

481
00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:11.000
whether it's in high school,
you know,

482
00:29:11.001 --> 00:29:16.001
how we all Kinda got labeled as you're either super smart or a jock or you know,

483
00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:20.960
and likewise you get your first job.
And I do think your first job,

484
00:29:20.961 --> 00:29:24.620
like recruiters are typically going to want to keep you in the same place.

485
00:29:24.621 --> 00:29:25.790
Like I remember being,

486
00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:29.810
I was in the airlines for six years and all I wanted to do was work for Nike.

487
00:29:29.811 --> 00:29:34.160
Like in my head,
I'm a marketing person at an a brand,

488
00:29:34.161 --> 00:29:36.860
doesn't matter what category there's,
but the recruiters were like,

489
00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:42.130
you're an airline person.
And I'm like,
do I look like I sniffed jet fuel?
Like,
no,

490
00:29:42.131 --> 00:29:44.260
I'm not.
I mean,
you don't know what I mean.
And,

491
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:49.470
and so I do believe that you are the only one that can navigate yourself out of

492
00:29:50.561 --> 00:29:54.580
those verticals that people will put you into and you have to do it.

493
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.170
And then the question is,
you ask as an industry or functional,

494
00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:04.000
I actually think it's a process of self discovery to figure out what it is for

495
00:30:04.001 --> 00:30:04.240
you.

496
00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:08.500
It might be that you're just bang on in the right industry and that's exactly

497
00:30:08.501 --> 00:30:11.450
where you should be.
Or as I found that you were,

498
00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:13.090
a lot of the people I interviewed,

499
00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:18.600
many of them didn't figure out where their place was to sort of land until well

500
00:30:18.641 --> 00:30:22.000
into their thirties.
And even though you might go,
well,

501
00:30:22.001 --> 00:30:25.480
did that mean the first 10 years was wasted?
No.

502
00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:29.440
Like in every instance it was kind of taking an expertise from here and

503
00:30:29.441 --> 00:30:30.790
connecting over here.

504
00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:35.580
Great example is one of my favorite stories in the book was a woman who,
um,

505
00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:40.900
had done to her MBA.
She was consulting,
um,
and in the music industry.

506
00:30:40.901 --> 00:30:44.920
And so she was doing marketing represented Gwen Steffani like at the top of the

507
00:30:44.921 --> 00:30:49.060
game,
right?
Yeah.
Deep down inside she was a singer and she's like,

508
00:30:49.061 --> 00:30:50.170
I'm really low,

509
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:54.040
like miserable because I'm marketing leads other people and I'm not,
you know,

510
00:30:54.041 --> 00:30:55.760
going back to what I did as a child has,

511
00:30:55.761 --> 00:30:58.660
she goes and basically long story short studies,

512
00:30:58.661 --> 00:31:02.290
they're singing again and ends up coming back and ends up singing at the Oscars

513
00:31:02.291 --> 00:31:06.040
when Slumdog millionaire was,
um,
nominators a great story,

514
00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:09.400
which leads her into,
okay,

515
00:31:09.401 --> 00:31:11.680
now I'm going to be a full time artist.

516
00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:15.490
And who would have thought all that business experience enabled her to create,

517
00:31:15.491 --> 00:31:19.300
she's now created our brand,
her and you know,
so does come together.

518
00:31:19.301 --> 00:31:24.250
And I think it's just about having the willingness to pursue new experiences.

519
00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:27.250
Even if it means it feels like you're starting over because you're not,

520
00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:29.260
you're going to be adding it to what you already had.

521
00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:31.473
<v 3>Definitely.</v>

522
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:36.860
<v 4>Thank you so much.
Um,
two questions.
One,</v>

523
00:31:36.861 --> 00:31:41.510
I'm curious what your sport was or,
or is insufficient to,
uh,

524
00:31:41.511 --> 00:31:43.760
to spinning.
And then second,

525
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.840
I thought the breakdown of competitive social and convenience was really

526
00:31:47.841 --> 00:31:52.700
interested in and from the perspective of flywheel competitive definitely makes

527
00:31:52.701 --> 00:31:56.270
sense with this spinning part of it.
How does bar fit into that?

528
00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:59.630
Because if you're going for a special,
a specialization of competition,

529
00:31:59.631 --> 00:32:00.700
that to me,
doesn't it?

530
00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:05.610
<v 0>Yeah,
there's very different for sure.
So,
um,
I would say,</v>

531
00:32:05.611 --> 00:32:10.250
so we at Flywheel we have the secondary offering called fly by,
which is,
um,

532
00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:15.060
a bar workout for anyone who knows what that is,
where and it is,
it's,

533
00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:18.990
it doesn't feel like it's the right compliment because it feels like it would be

534
00:32:18.991 --> 00:32:22.620
a different type of consumer.
But it is precision training.

535
00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:27.650
And what we find is the people who are doing a flywheel that's doing a lot of

536
00:32:27.871 --> 00:32:32.010
cardio for them,
but they also need to complement that.
And our bar program,

537
00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:35.760
it's not the easiest one in the market by any stretch.

538
00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:40.160
And so I think it really appeals to that person who's like,
okay,
I'm in,

539
00:32:40.161 --> 00:32:44.260
I'm going to go and really feel it today.
You know?
So it does,
uh,

540
00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:48.860
it does actually end up connecting because of the type of programming that it
is.

541
00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:53.180
And then to answer your question,
tried field hockey,
failed,
try tennis,

542
00:32:53.181 --> 00:32:57.080
failed skiing,
failed waterskiing,
fouled sailing,
all of the above.

543
00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:02.950
But now I do a lot of fly wheel obviously and running and I do um,

544
00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:06.330
tough mudders.
Anyone in this room done tough mudder.

545
00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:08.330
One of the great stories in the book by the way,

546
00:33:08.331 --> 00:33:12.720
is will the founder of tough mudder,
because that's a great example.

547
00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:17.600
You'll question of,
you know,
his parents are like,
oh,
you just go be a consultant.

548
00:33:17.601 --> 00:33:21.260
And he's like,
no,
I want to electrocute people for fun.
You know,
it's like,

549
00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:25.860
it didn't sound like it was going to be a huge success and it's now something

550
00:33:25.861 --> 00:33:29.270
I've believed they had something like 3 million people have taken these things

551
00:33:29.271 --> 00:33:32.030
globally.
I mean it's off the charts success story,

552
00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:36.230
but a great example of he had taken all these weird experiences.

553
00:33:36.231 --> 00:33:38.240
He worked in the counter terrorism unit,

554
00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:42.260
he went to Harvard business going like all these crazy things to create this

555
00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:45.140
what like sort of unheard of concept.
So

556
00:33:47.010 --> 00:33:47.843
<v 3>for sure.</v>

557
00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:50.310
<v 5>Hi.
Um,</v>

558
00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:53.460
so one thing that I really like about firewall and I think a lot of other people

559
00:33:53.461 --> 00:33:57.830
do is like how it's like kind of on the forefront of workout technology and like

560
00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:00.090
how you can learn so much more about yourself.

561
00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:04.050
So my question for you is kind of like what technology is coming next for

562
00:34:04.051 --> 00:34:07.470
flywheel and like where are you guys going to take it in and say five years?

563
00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:12.390
<v 0>Oh,
it's coming.
So yeah,
it's a great question because um,</v>

564
00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:16.530
flywheel actually pioneered the technology on the bikes.

565
00:34:16.531 --> 00:34:19.620
So for anyone who has been in the world of fitness for years,

566
00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:24.810
spinning was created in the 90s,
like spinning I endo cycling.

567
00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:29.100
But for many years you could be that person in the back of a dark room when they

568
00:34:29.101 --> 00:34:33.900
said to not resistance and you're sort of kind of pretending and not really.
Um,

569
00:34:33.901 --> 00:34:38.710
and what flywheel did was add technology to the bike so that when you are

570
00:34:38.711 --> 00:34:40.230
riding,
the instructor would say,

571
00:34:40.231 --> 00:34:44.670
I want your resistance to be here and I want you to be hitting this on the Rpms,

572
00:34:44.671 --> 00:34:47.160
which is holding you very,
very accountable as you know.

573
00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:52.200
And what's neat about that I think is that people can then hold themselves

574
00:34:52.201 --> 00:34:55.710
accountable over a long period of time to how they're doing.
Um,

575
00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:59.820
so now I do believe and just,
you know,

576
00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:04.080
with the team that we are working with at fly where we all believe that the

577
00:35:04.081 --> 00:35:06.360
future of fitness is accountability.

578
00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:10.500
I think we're gonna see this more and more and more across every category where

579
00:35:10.501 --> 00:35:11.334
people,

580
00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:16.340
they want to know the output of that particular piece of effort compared to

581
00:35:16.770 --> 00:35:18.150
anything else that they were doing.

582
00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:23.570
It's not a perfect science yet because we can't track things like bar and the

583
00:35:23.641 --> 00:35:26.430
same way that we can,
um,
uh,
cycling workout.

584
00:35:26.431 --> 00:35:31.170
But I believe that's where all of our effort needs to go.
I also believe that,

585
00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:35.910
um,
uh,
fit the fitness industry.
And as you guys know,
we have the quantified self.

586
00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:40.440
We got a little too carried away with tracking the data as opposed to giving

587
00:35:40.441 --> 00:35:42.710
insights off the data.
Like,
you know,

588
00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:45.930
going from sort of numbers to knowledge if you will.

589
00:35:45.931 --> 00:35:48.750
And I do think that's also where the future is.

590
00:35:48.751 --> 00:35:53.040
Like how do we use that data to prod you to push you to get you to go to the

591
00:35:53.041 --> 00:35:53.550
next level.

592
00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:57.420
So we definitely have a lot of things coming as a big announcement actually

593
00:35:57.421 --> 00:35:59.460
coming in three weeks.
So watch the space.

594
00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:05.120
But very much we believe that technology and accountability is at the core of

595
00:36:05.641 --> 00:36:07.020
willfulness has going for sure.

596
00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:12.070
<v 3>Okay.</v>

597
00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:16.890
<v 0>Okay.
So,
uh,
so I love your message of extreme mastery and focus.
Um,</v>

598
00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:20.530
I was also interested though when you talked about challenging yourself and if

599
00:36:20.531 --> 00:36:22.660
you're a creative person and try to be more analytical.

600
00:36:22.661 --> 00:36:25.870
So how do you balance the two and how do you decide one,

601
00:36:25.871 --> 00:36:30.020
do you just focus on mastery verse challenging yourself to something get up?

602
00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:35.360
So I'll give you a personal example and cause I think all of us,

603
00:36:35.361 --> 00:36:39.500
when we play to our extreme strengths,
you just like,

604
00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:44.090
you go to a different level of performance.
And for me,
innovation,
creativity,

605
00:36:44.091 --> 00:36:47.570
all these things have always been like that I can do easily.

606
00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:52.520
Then I find myself president of a $5 billion business that's needing to be

607
00:36:52.521 --> 00:36:55.730
turned around.
And by the way,
when I was 20,

608
00:36:55.731 --> 00:36:57.980
I failed stage one accounting.

609
00:36:58.010 --> 00:37:02.570
And so in my head had my entire career told myself,
I suck,
I suck,
I suck.

610
00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:07.520
I can't do this,
avoided it to,
you know,
and finally I was in a job where you can,

611
00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:08.990
you can't hide anymore.

612
00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:13.100
And so I actually like eventually put my hand up to my boss and I said,

613
00:37:13.101 --> 00:37:14.000
this is an issue.

614
00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:17.900
I ended up going down the street actually to have it remedial finance.
Um,

615
00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:22.720
which was awesome for so many reasons.
But here's the thing,
it will,

616
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:24.950
I will never be like a CFO.

617
00:37:24.951 --> 00:37:28.640
But what I did come back with was actually a real passion for,

618
00:37:28.641 --> 00:37:31.320
I really enjoyed it and loved it.
And it,

619
00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:36.400
it is just a compliment so that I have a better view that I can balance my

620
00:37:36.771 --> 00:37:37.604
strengths with.

621
00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:40.910
So that's one example where I think you need to make sure you're not just

622
00:37:40.911 --> 00:37:43.310
ignoring the blind spots.
That said,

623
00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:48.970
I also know I will never in any role not surround myself with really amazing CFO

624
00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:52.370
because that's not ever going to be my biggest strength.

625
00:37:52.371 --> 00:37:57.371
So it's about knowing kind of how to surround yourself with the opposite skills

626
00:37:57.501 --> 00:38:01.760
as well as kind of just shoring up your knowledge to make sure it's not a blind

627
00:38:01.761 --> 00:38:06.450
spot is what I would say.
I have so much for coming.

628
00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:09.000
Um,
so a lot of us work at,

629
00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:14.210
well a very large company or work with very large companies where,

630
00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:18.530
um,
you know,
the break yourself to make yourself is,

631
00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:20.580
is more challenging,
you know?

632
00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:25.860
And so when you're working in one of those larger cultures that has a lot of

633
00:38:25.861 --> 00:38:30.270
inertia to not change or not break there Yellen organization,

634
00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:35.070
what advice do you have for,
you know,
staying true to your own individual.

635
00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:40.230
Then also impacting a potential break in that own organization and leading that

636
00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:44.530
herself?
Yeah,
I mean,
I,
what am I,
the,

637
00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:49.120
my favorite chapters in the book actually is,
um,
what I call change the game.

638
00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:53.680
And it's my personal experience of actually being at Gatorade,

639
00:38:53.850 --> 00:38:56.020
which Pepsi Co you may work with,

640
00:38:56.021 --> 00:39:00.430
some of you is a giant company within which,
you know,
Gatorade was one,

641
00:39:00.431 --> 00:39:04.480
$5 billion piece and it required,
I mean,

642
00:39:04.481 --> 00:39:07.590
this was a business that and after the recession,
you know,

643
00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:11.710
was a $5 billion top line that lost 500 million off the top line in one year.

644
00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:13.750
I mean,
it was huge,
right?

645
00:39:13.751 --> 00:39:18.550
And so small incremental change clearly wasn't going to do it yet,

646
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:20.950
uh,
to move everyone along,

647
00:39:20.951 --> 00:39:24.280
like everything that we were needing to do to fix the business week,

648
00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:28.330
totally counter to what had worked for a really long time.

649
00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:33.100
And so you sort of,
I remember along the way having an eye,

650
00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:36.760
there's a lot of dramatic moments in the story where,
you know,
we,

651
00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:40.120
we thought we were heading the right direction and the business didn't start

652
00:39:40.121 --> 00:39:42.040
turning.
And everyone's like questioning,

653
00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:46.030
have I totally screwed up the business here?
All of the above.

654
00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:50.500
But I do believe,
like in that case,
I,

655
00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:55.180
two things going from a one was that by now I had developed this real specialty

656
00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:59.440
of understanding athletes,
innovation in that space.

657
00:39:59.441 --> 00:40:03.370
And I knew it better than anyone in terms of the broader peer group because it

658
00:40:03.371 --> 00:40:05.350
was where I'd grown up.
And secondly,

659
00:40:05.351 --> 00:40:08.680
I'd been fired twice in my twenties so every step of the way,

660
00:40:08.681 --> 00:40:11.380
I remember saying to myself to the point of inertia,

661
00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:16.570
if I play on the defense,
we're not going to win and I am going to get fired.

662
00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:20.710
If I play on the offense,
there's a good chance we'll win.

663
00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:23.950
And there's also a decent chance I'll get fired.
But that's okay.

664
00:40:23.951 --> 00:40:28.690
Cause I've been there before and I'd rather go down trying to do what I did know

665
00:40:28.691 --> 00:40:32.200
how to do best.
And I do believe for all of us,

666
00:40:32.201 --> 00:40:33.820
like we get into these situations,

667
00:40:33.821 --> 00:40:38.530
particularly in big companies and particularly in times like the recession where

668
00:40:38.531 --> 00:40:41.350
the fear kicks in and no one if everyone's like,

669
00:40:41.650 --> 00:40:45.520
but the boss said they wanted Blah Blah and this is what I've been told to do.

670
00:40:45.521 --> 00:40:49.480
But the the boss doesn't want you to please and they want you to drive results.

671
00:40:49.481 --> 00:40:53.110
And I think as long as you can frame what you're doing around,

672
00:40:53.111 --> 00:40:54.790
I know this doesn't feel right,

673
00:40:54.791 --> 00:40:59.791
but here's the line from a to B and stay with it and like go with all your

674
00:41:00.431 --> 00:41:03.010
specialty skills.
That's the other thing I really believe in.

675
00:41:03.011 --> 00:41:07.180
Like you will have so much more conviction if you come from a place that's your

676
00:41:07.181 --> 00:41:11.800
own personal expertise and you kind of have no choice but to go against the

677
00:41:11.801 --> 00:41:15.100
inertia because in the end what happens if you don't?

678
00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:17.770
So I love that question by the way.

679
00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:20.043
<v 3>Thank you.</v>

680
00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:27.320
<v 0>One more question if no one else is in line.
When it comes</v>

681
00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:31.000
<v 4>to the space that you're in,
sort of fitness,
sports in general,</v>

682
00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:35.540
is there a trend that you of see coming up behind you that you're like,
Huh,

683
00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:37.340
that's sort of interesting.
I wonder where that goes,

684
00:41:37.341 --> 00:41:40.270
whether it's in the breakdown of the three different kinds of spaces or,

685
00:41:40.271 --> 00:41:42.680
and your kind of fitness or sort of what's,

686
00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:44.210
what are you seeing out of the corner of your eye?

687
00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:45.581
<v 0>That's a great question.</v>

688
00:41:45.581 --> 00:41:50.581
I definitely believe that the boutique specializing phenomenon is at the very

689
00:41:50.921 --> 00:41:52.900
beginning of where it's going.
Um,

690
00:41:53.710 --> 00:41:58.710
boutique fitness has grown 400% in the last four years and big box gyms have

691
00:41:59.621 --> 00:42:00.760
stayed flat.
So,

692
00:42:00.970 --> 00:42:04.840
and what's interesting is that people are coming in to the boutique category.

693
00:42:04.841 --> 00:42:09.100
Some of it's a little bit of,
it is coming from big,
um,
full service gyms.

694
00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:12.790
A lot of it's people coming in to fitness for the first time.

695
00:42:12.791 --> 00:42:15.910
It's creating a lot of energy in the category.
I mean,

696
00:42:15.911 --> 00:42:19.420
health and wellness is in a great place,
right?
Um,

697
00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:24.110
but I believe with boutique we're still at the very beginning because it's,
um,

698
00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:27.220
nobody's really blown up and scaled yet.
The way,

699
00:42:27.221 --> 00:42:29.770
if you go back to retail in the 90s,

700
00:42:29.771 --> 00:42:33.310
like some of those boutique brands really took it to the next level.

701
00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:38.400
And I believe what I'm seeing at least is there's a lot of people coming into

702
00:42:38.410 --> 00:42:41.950
the fitness space right now,
whether it's sophisticated investors,
leaders,

703
00:42:41.951 --> 00:42:42.310
whatever.

704
00:42:42.310 --> 00:42:46.450
I believe it's all going to start going upwards and scaling in a big way.

705
00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:51.790
I also think that technology is going to be a huge driver and Omni channel

706
00:42:51.791 --> 00:42:52.660
experiences.

707
00:42:52.661 --> 00:42:56.740
I think that's going to be so that you can be a part of the flywheel community

708
00:42:56.950 --> 00:43:01.350
and you can participate in it and it wherever you may be around the world.
Um,

709
00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:05.830
I think that's a big piece of where we're going.
That said,
I do think that the,

710
00:43:05.850 --> 00:43:06.683
um,

711
00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:11.320
in person experience is not going away.

712
00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:14.950
And what I mean by that is if you look across retail right now,

713
00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:19.210
definitely retail in general is suffering because everything's moving to

714
00:43:19.211 --> 00:43:23.260
ecommerce.
But look at what's booming.
It's things like theme,
parks,
restaurants,

715
00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:24.303
fitness.

716
00:43:24.310 --> 00:43:29.310
Because I believe humans are craving time with other humans and that's what

717
00:43:29.621 --> 00:43:32.350
those kind of businesses are bringing his experiences together.

718
00:43:32.351 --> 00:43:34.300
So I think that's not going to go away.
In fact,

719
00:43:34.301 --> 00:43:36.970
I think there's a lot more opportunity right there.

720
00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:42.560
<v 4>Who were your favorite two subjects that you interviewed for the book and for</v>

721
00:43:42.561 --> 00:43:45.160
any kind of quirky different reason than people might know?

722
00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:49.350
<v 0>Yes.
So funny.
I can't,
I can't,
it's like picking one of my children.</v>

723
00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:54.480
Um,
no I did.
So the,
it's a,
it's,
I will say,

724
00:43:54.570 --> 00:43:56.760
I'll pick two interesting subjects.
Firstly,

725
00:43:56.761 --> 00:44:00.560
I will start by saying there's an amazing Gugler on the book.
Um,

726
00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:04.980
Dan Keisling if anyone knows who now works in Jigsaw.
So he's a fan favorite,

727
00:44:04.981 --> 00:44:06.630
you can find him.
Um,

728
00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:11.660
but I would say probably the unexpected ones that really blew me away were,

729
00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:15.540
um,
Mr Cartoon,

730
00:44:15.541 --> 00:44:20.541
the Tattoo artist was just phenomenal in terms of where he came from,

731
00:44:20.911 --> 00:44:21.930
where he got to,

732
00:44:21.931 --> 00:44:26.730
how he just had this incredible ability to get uncomfortable and keep learning.

733
00:44:26.731 --> 00:44:31.440
I mean,
he and some of his one liners,
which is awesome.
I really,
really him.

734
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:36.450
Um,
and then there's a personal story actually connection to me,

735
00:44:36.451 --> 00:44:37.680
my sister in law.

736
00:44:37.681 --> 00:44:42.630
And it's an incredible story of overcoming profound mental health issues to

737
00:44:42.631 --> 00:44:45.690
become really quite successful on the global stage.

738
00:44:45.691 --> 00:44:49.920
And so different than anything else in the book but so incredibly inspiring.

739
00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:52.350
But there's,
they're all amazing.
They were great stories.

740
00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:53.773
<v 3>Definitely.</v>

741
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:57.320
<v 0>How do you think about the competition?</v>

742
00:44:57.321 --> 00:45:01.230
Like let's use cell cycle obviously there according to your categories,

743
00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:02.840
they're in maybe a different one,

744
00:45:02.841 --> 00:45:07.460
but how much do you as the CEO pay attention to them and without getting too

745
00:45:07.461 --> 00:45:11.150
paranoid are too distracted but still making sure that you know what you're up

746
00:45:11.151 --> 00:45:14.300
against if they're your top competitor.
Yeah.

747
00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:17.710
Well first of all I'm going to say something,
it would probably sound surprising,

748
00:45:17.711 --> 00:45:22.510
but I love soul cycle and I really,
I believe that when they do well,

749
00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:25.570
the category does well.
We all do well.
Same with Palestine.

750
00:45:25.571 --> 00:45:29.920
Like I think I actually believe all of us are bringing tons of energy and all

751
00:45:29.921 --> 00:45:31.720
the boats are rising.
So I think,

752
00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:35.470
and what's really interesting is they are very different consumers,

753
00:45:35.471 --> 00:45:37.270
people coming for very different reasons.

754
00:45:37.271 --> 00:45:42.271
So I don't spend a lot of time thinking about them because I do spend a lot of

755
00:45:42.371 --> 00:45:45.370
time thinking about our core consumer who's looking for something quite

756
00:45:45.371 --> 00:45:45.791
different.

757
00:45:45.791 --> 00:45:50.791
And I would say I personally learned a lot from working at a company like virgin

758
00:45:53.650 --> 00:45:57.910
or Nike where they never thought about the competition and only play their own

759
00:45:57.911 --> 00:46:02.440
game compared to the soda wars,
you know,
coke and Pepsi,

760
00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:03.790
Powerade,
Gatorade,
we,

761
00:46:03.791 --> 00:46:08.410
it's a completely different mindset and that can drag you into different places

762
00:46:08.411 --> 00:46:10.300
that aren't necessarily right for your consumer.

763
00:46:10.301 --> 00:46:13.630
So I think I came away with that going stay focused.

764
00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:16.043
<v 3>Definitely.</v>

765
00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:23.960
<v 0>So thank you so much for coming.
I'm a flywheel Devo tea,</v>

766
00:46:23.961 --> 00:46:26.630
so I'm so excited to see you here.
And for those who haven't tried it,

767
00:46:26.631 --> 00:46:31.610
we have a great Gugler discounts.
Oh yes.
Um,
in the vein of,

768
00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:35.390
I know you had mentioned that boutique fitness is sort of just starting and it's

769
00:46:35.391 --> 00:46:36.230
going to explode.

770
00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:40.940
What do you foresee as one of the biggest challenges facing flywheel in the

771
00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:45.260
coming years?
I would say staying focused actually,

772
00:46:45.830 --> 00:46:50.830
because I do think that there is a ton of excitement around the fitness category

773
00:46:51.171 --> 00:46:52.004
in general.

774
00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:57.160
I also think daily there's new technology and innovation that people knocking

775
00:46:57.321 --> 00:47:01.880
down our door wanting to suggest we do this,
that and the other and it's,

776
00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:06.530
I personally hit find because I have not grown up in a technology company like

777
00:47:06.531 --> 00:47:08.570
you or as a CEO,

778
00:47:08.571 --> 00:47:12.740
it's hard to sort the real ideas from the many things that are just going to

779
00:47:12.741 --> 00:47:17.210
fall by the wayside,
you know,
and,
and not get distracted by the wrong one.

780
00:47:17.211 --> 00:47:21.650
So I actually think the opportunity is so right for us,

781
00:47:21.651 --> 00:47:26.600
but we have to know we've got a place the right bets and focus on them and not

782
00:47:26.601 --> 00:47:28.340
get too spread too thin,

783
00:47:28.590 --> 00:47:29.423
<v 3>I don't think.</v>

784
00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:32.501
<v 6>Thanks.</v>

785
00:47:32.501 --> 00:47:37.501
With your focus and leadership on technology and accountability in the fitness

786
00:47:37.691 --> 00:47:38.110
space,

787
00:47:38.110 --> 00:47:43.110
are you all thinking about integrating fitness data with larger healthcare data

788
00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:45.130
and how does that materialize?

789
00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:48.610
<v 0>Yes.
Uh,
we are at the very beginning of,</v>

790
00:47:48.611 --> 00:47:51.250
began to think about it because we're still a very young company.

791
00:47:51.251 --> 00:47:53.620
But for sure I think that's what we all need to do.

792
00:47:53.621 --> 00:47:57.940
That's what our consumers want us to do is help them get a more holistic
picture.

793
00:47:57.941 --> 00:47:59.170
So absolutely,

794
00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:02.223
<v 3>definitely.</v>

795
00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:03.260
<v 7>Hi.
Um,</v>

796
00:48:03.450 --> 00:48:08.340
you mentioned a lot about like failing early and failing fast.
One,

797
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:11.040
it was wondering if you could talk a little bit about also like,
um,

798
00:48:11.550 --> 00:48:13.860
during the times when you have failed,

799
00:48:13.861 --> 00:48:16.640
like how did you go about picking yourself back up?
Yeah.

800
00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:17.790
What are different support networks?

801
00:48:17.791 --> 00:48:22.791
We had to allow that introspection and get yourself to be propelled up for that

802
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:25.410
posts.
Um,

803
00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:30.910
<v 0>yeah.
Yeah.
So let's talk about failing fast for a section for,</v>

804
00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:34.420
for second and failing hard.

805
00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:40.230
Maybe I'll use that term because I fail fast is a like big idea that thankfully

806
00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:41.920
the,

807
00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:46.330
you guys have bought to the world in general in terms of as we are in business

808
00:48:46.331 --> 00:48:50.620
and thinking about innovation,
trying,
experimenting,
iterating,
rolling,
moving.

809
00:48:50.621 --> 00:48:55.210
And we all have to be better at doing that.
That is different to failure.

810
00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:58.330
That really deeply impacts you.

811
00:48:58.331 --> 00:49:02.290
And teaches you and actually takes you personally to another level.

812
00:49:02.291 --> 00:49:06.970
And that is one of the reasons I went to great lengths to just put it all out

813
00:49:06.971 --> 00:49:08.530
there.
And by the way,
I'm not the only one,

814
00:49:08.531 --> 00:49:11.530
like some of the other stories in my book,
I said to everyone,
I,

815
00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:15.430
when I interviewed them,
I don't want the great surface amazingness.

816
00:49:15.431 --> 00:49:20.200
I want tell me how it felt.
And like Condoleezza Rice making the decision,

817
00:49:20.570 --> 00:49:24.160
extraordinarily tough decision to give up on her dream of being a concert

818
00:49:24.161 --> 00:49:28.210
pianist and take it,
you know,
tell me what that feels like.
Um,

819
00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:32.050
but what I would say is you have to like,

820
00:49:32.051 --> 00:49:35.770
I actually breakdown in the book the real process of how you should go through

821
00:49:35.771 --> 00:49:37.110
it cause everyone says to be,

822
00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:40.060
how do you go into an interview after you've just been fired twice.

823
00:49:40.450 --> 00:49:42.670
Just a good Christian,
but you have to,

824
00:49:42.671 --> 00:49:46.390
I believe really feel it and process it.

825
00:49:46.391 --> 00:49:48.160
And if you've ever had a failure,

826
00:49:48.161 --> 00:49:52.960
I know in my case I spent the first at least month telling everyone around me

827
00:49:52.961 --> 00:49:57.160
that it was their fault.
Like,
you know,
must've been the sucky industry,

828
00:49:57.161 --> 00:50:00.220
the leadership,
whatever.
And everyone you tell that to,

829
00:50:00.221 --> 00:50:02.620
you can sort of see in their eyes they don't really believe you.

830
00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:04.180
And that's because you don't really believe you.

831
00:50:04.181 --> 00:50:08.260
And then you have to just sit there and go,
okay,
this hurts.

832
00:50:08.290 --> 00:50:09.220
I'm going to own it.

833
00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:13.330
But the minute you actually take ownership for it and man up and say it to

834
00:50:13.331 --> 00:50:15.310
someone,
like in a job interview saying,

835
00:50:15.610 --> 00:50:19.300
I got fired because I did this,

836
00:50:19.330 --> 00:50:21.940
which means I will never make that mistake again.

837
00:50:21.970 --> 00:50:25.630
It's so empowering because you own it,

838
00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:29.330
you're in control of it from then on.
So I do think we all tend to,

839
00:50:29.331 --> 00:50:34.331
it's human nature to want to cover up fails because you kind of think it to bad

840
00:50:34.341 --> 00:50:35.510
thing,
but when you do,

841
00:50:35.511 --> 00:50:39.530
it's like this scary thing that's always chasing you through life and,

842
00:50:39.531 --> 00:50:42.350
and maybe it's going to catch up and someone's going to find out about it one

843
00:50:42.351 --> 00:50:46.160
day.
It's better just to feel it,
own it.
And then by the way,

844
00:50:46.161 --> 00:50:49.340
you do get great growth and that's what you did it for.
Right.

845
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:50.780
I always tell people,

846
00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:54.110
don't fail if you're not going to get the output on the other side.

847
00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:56.493
<v 3>For sure.</v>

848
00:50:59.530 --> 00:51:02.320
<v 0>I think my little counter clock is about to run out,</v>

849
00:51:03.070 --> 00:51:06.290
so thank you very much.
It's been really fun.
Great.
Kristen

850
00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:10.280
<v 3>[inaudible].</v>
