1
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.060
Uh,
Nathan is the founder and Executive Director of the nonprofit.

2
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.820
I'm from Driftwood,
which you'll be hearing about today.
Uh,

3
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.300
which is an online archive archive of first person Lgbtq stories.

4
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.320
In 2011,

5
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.700
Mansky completed a four month 50 state story collection tour,

6
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:25.960
ensuring that,
uh,

7
00:00:25.961 --> 00:00:29.410
I'm from driftwoods stories represented people from all across the country.

8
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.390
The story is on,

9
00:00:31.391 --> 00:00:36.040
I'm from driftwood are used by family counselors as well as educators to aid

10
00:00:36.041 --> 00:00:40.420
them in their work.
Uh,
and I'm from driftwoods newest program,
which is called,

11
00:00:40.421 --> 00:00:44.710
what was it like documents,
stories from Lgbtq elders,

12
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.920
which as you know,
is something that we have also been looking at,
uh,

13
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.780
in the gay colors is understanding how to better serve,
um,
older Lgbtq folks.

14
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.260
Um,
Matthew grew up in Driftwood,
Texas,

15
00:00:56.261 --> 00:01:00.940
hence the name I'm from driftwood where one of his weekly chores was burning

16
00:01:00.941 --> 00:01:04.130
trash in a burn barrel,
which I really want to hear about.
Uh,

17
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.730
he now lives in Brooklyn where he sorts and recycles.

18
00:01:06.731 --> 00:01:11.680
Thank you for saving the planet.
Um,
so Nathan tell us a little bit,

19
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.040
uh,
now that we know a little bit about you.
About I'm from driftwood.

20
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.560
<v 2>Yeah.
Next month in March is actually going to be our nine year anniversary,</v>

21
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.820
which we're very excited about.
And it started,

22
00:01:23.821 --> 00:01:25.580
the idea came to me from a,

23
00:01:25.581 --> 00:01:30.330
after watching the film milk in 2008 with Sean Penn.
And uh,

24
00:01:30.331 --> 00:01:30.990
there was,

25
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.840
I saw the film on a Wednesday and Thursday morning I was thinking about a

26
00:01:33.841 --> 00:01:38.250
photograph of Harvey Milk and in the photograph he is holding,

27
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.580
he's sitting on the hood of the car in the San Francisco Pride March and he's

28
00:01:41.581 --> 00:01:44.880
holding a big sign and the sign,

29
00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:47.280
all it said was I'm from Woodmere New York.

30
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.050
And I was just thinking about that photo,
uh,

31
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.310
over and over again and asking myself like,
why is Harvey Milk?

32
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.150
Everyone associates him with San Francisco,
this big queer Mecca.
Uh,

33
00:01:57.151 --> 00:01:58.240
but he's not from there.
He,

34
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.290
he's sitting here proclaiming that he's from this town that we're in New York.

35
00:02:01.291 --> 00:02:02.340
So some people might know where it is,

36
00:02:02.341 --> 00:02:04.230
but most people don't know where Woodmere is.

37
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.550
And that really resonated with me because I'm not from Brooklyn or New York.

38
00:02:08.551 --> 00:02:10.260
I'm from Driftwood,
Texas.

39
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.940
And I feel like that message of you're not alone no matter where you are,
um,

40
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.770
would have meant a lot to me.

41
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.310
Growing up in driftwood where my main issue was isolation,

42
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.270
I didn't feel like it or I did feel like I was the only gay person in the world.

43
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.020
Um,
so that message of you're not alone would have meant a lot to me.

44
00:02:28.021 --> 00:02:32.880
So I wanted to,
to take that message out there through storytelling and,
uh,

45
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.500
that at the time I was working in advertising as a copywriter and I was worried

46
00:02:37.501 --> 00:02:41.970
that I wouldn't have time to do this.
And,
uh,
so I had to recap.

47
00:02:41.971 --> 00:02:44.130
I saw milk on Wednesday.
I thought of the idea on Thursday.

48
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.950
Friday I went into my job and I was laid off.

49
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.370
So I suddenly had all the time in the world to,
uh,
you know,

50
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.460
it was late 2008 height of the recession.
Um,

51
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.590
so there was little chance to get a new job right away.

52
00:02:55.591 --> 00:02:58.770
So I put everything I had into it.
Told all my friends,

53
00:02:58.771 --> 00:03:01.810
everyone rallied around me and,
um,

54
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.490
helped launch three months after thinking of the idea and March,
2009.

55
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:09.760
So yeah,
that's how,
how it came to be.

56
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.520
<v 1>They're cool often from photograph.
Um,</v>

57
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.060
so tell us a little bit about what I'm from driftwood seeks to do.

58
00:03:16.061 --> 00:03:17.470
What is the project about?

59
00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.970
<v 2>Uh,
it at its core,
it's about sending that message if you are not alone,
uh,</v>

60
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.450
through storytelling.
And something really interesting happened,
uh,

61
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.250
early on we started as just written stories so anyone could write a story and

62
00:03:29.251 --> 00:03:33.270
still can,
uh,
and submit their written story.
And,
um,

63
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.210
but it started really to help queer youth and smaller towns.

64
00:03:36.211 --> 00:03:39.300
That was my singular focus.
And after launching the site,

65
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.560
we started getting all this feedback from people letting us know what this story

66
00:03:42.561 --> 00:03:46.090
is meant to them.
And it wasn't just queer youth in small towns.
It was,
uh,

67
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.650
people here in Manhattan.
It was people all over the country and the world,
uh,

68
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.970
letting us know that just by re hearing stories from other people,

69
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.190
whether they connected with it or not,
uh,

70
00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.150
made them more empathetic to other issues.
Um,
and then of course,

71
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.840
people did read stories that they related to and it helped them realize I'm not

72
00:04:03.841 --> 00:04:07.290
alone.
And there were two pieces of feedback that we got very early on,

73
00:04:07.291 --> 00:04:10.110
which made us realize that we were on the right track.
Uh,

74
00:04:10.111 --> 00:04:12.640
one was from a gay teenager who said,
uh,

75
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.200
seeing these stories made him realize that he's not alone and that they

76
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:21.180
literally saved his life just by realizing that,
you know,
wherever he was from,

77
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:23.580
that there are other people like the hidden out there.
Uh,

78
00:04:23.581 --> 00:04:26.940
the other one was from somebody who was almost 60,
and he said,

79
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.060
I thought I was the only one.
I'm not,
and I just came out this past Christmas,
uh,

80
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.920
at the age of 60.

81
00:04:31.921 --> 00:04:36.660
So once we realized that we were making an impact across the entire spectrum,

82
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.240
we sort of broadened our reach.
Uh,

83
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.380
but still with that message of you're not alone.
Um,
but no matter who you are,

84
00:04:43.381 --> 00:04:48.090
where you are,
what age you are.
Um,
so,
so yeah,
that's,
that's really,
you know,
what,

85
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.810
what we are still,
uh,
but with a broader message.
So

86
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.000
<v 1>that's really interesting.
So what,</v>

87
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.060
you spoke a little bit about the impact that it's had on a couple of
individuals,

88
00:04:57.061 --> 00:05:00.600
but can you speak broadly more broadly about the impact that you feel this

89
00:05:00.601 --> 00:05:01.650
particular,

90
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.710
the evolution of this Lgbtq Story Archive has had on your members readership

91
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.053
viewership?

92
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.193
<v 2>Yeah,
we,</v>

93
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:15.230
I had an intern a few years ago and I was still in this mindset of,

94
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.130
especially since we're nonprofit,

95
00:05:17.131 --> 00:05:20.000
so we have to apply for funding and all that fun stuff.
And,
uh,

96
00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.810
constantly we're having to tell people why we're doing what we're doing is so

97
00:05:24.811 --> 00:05:26.940
important and why.
And

98
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.550
it was frustrating and a little scary.
I was like,
I can't answer this succinctly.

99
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.620
You know,
I like wash the story,
you'll get it,

100
00:05:34.621 --> 00:05:39.390
but that's not an acceptable answer on a grant application.
Uh,
so I,

101
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.830
I gave a this intern,
this task of researching,

102
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:48.990
like why stories are so powerful and why they increase empathy that we knew they

103
00:05:48.991 --> 00:05:52.320
did.
We have the feedback to support it,
but I didn't understand why.

104
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.910
And I kept like,
I felt like I was just grasping for Aaron.

105
00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.720
I couldn't sink my teeth into an,
and,
uh,
what he came back with,

106
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.620
um,
was,
was science of course.
So it was,
uh,

107
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.860
there's something called mirror neurons and everyone's brain and whenever you

108
00:06:06.861 --> 00:06:11.390
tell a story,
you're activating a mirror neurons and that person's brain.

109
00:06:11.391 --> 00:06:13.040
So on a very microscopic level,

110
00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.980
they are experiencing the same thing that you experienced.

111
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.700
So if I tell you a story and let's just say our lives are completely different,

112
00:06:19.701 --> 00:06:23.180
and I tell you the story about what it's like to grow up gay and Driftwood,

113
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.920
and I tell a story well,
and uh,

114
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.200
then I'm activating those mirror neurons in your brain so that,
you know,

115
00:06:30.201 --> 00:06:35.090
whenever you,
you hear a story like,
oh,
I,
I get it.
I feel you,
you know,

116
00:06:35.091 --> 00:06:39.680
I'm,
I'm in your shoes.
That's the reason for that is those mirror neurons.
So,

117
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:44.970
uh,
since then we have focused more on telling stories.

118
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.260
Well,
so every single story that we collect and share,
uh,

119
00:06:48.261 --> 00:06:51.380
we make sure that there is a story arc.
There's a beginning,
middle,
and end.

120
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.370
There's a conflict and a resolution and all these traditional storytelling,
uh,

121
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.600
components that make a story so that we can activate those mirror neurons.

122
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.180
So we're basically trying to control mines.

123
00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.490
<v 1>Just a simple,
simple task.
Yeah.
Nothing,
nothing difficult.</v>

124
00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.760
Building empathy in the world,
changing people's minds about things.
No,

125
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:11.330
no big deal.
Um,

126
00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:16.360
so how did the development of I'm from driftwood go,
did it grow very,

127
00:07:16.361 --> 00:07:20.790
very quickly?
Were you surprised by the growth or,
um,

128
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:24.820
has it developed sort of as a slow burn over the time that you've been going?

129
00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:30.070
<v 2>It was a little bit of a rollercoaster.
Uh,
we,
we launched just as a website,</v>

130
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:30.700
um,

131
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.760
and I didn't really have this grand vision of what it could become at the time.

132
00:07:33.761 --> 00:07:36.320
I just wanted to start collecting and sharing stories.
Uh,

133
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:38.260
about a week after launching,
uh,

134
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.490
I was just spending all my time emailing this is 2008,
2000 or 2009,

135
00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:45.260
like blow everyone had a blog at that time.
Just,

136
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.920
it was a blog heavy time on the internet.
And,
uh,

137
00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.440
there were a lot of LGBT blogs and I was just emailing every,
uh,

138
00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.190
Lgbtq blog that I could find.

139
00:07:54.191 --> 00:07:56.830
And a lot of them started picking it up and sharing it.

140
00:07:56.831 --> 00:08:01.570
And we just caught a wave of stories.
And soon after that,
um,

141
00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:03.430
I had a friend in Philadelphia,

142
00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:08.580
his name is Mark [inaudible] and I had this idea of a little PR video I wanted

143
00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:09.453
to do in New York.

144
00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.310
I was going to walk around the city with a whiteboard and happy we'll right

145
00:08:12.311 --> 00:08:15.460
where they're from just to like get the idea out there again.

146
00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:18.040
And another nod to that photograph of Harvey Milk.

147
00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:21.400
And he would visit New York frequently.

148
00:08:21.401 --> 00:08:24.730
And I told them this idea and he was like,
Oh,
I'm into it.
Um,

149
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:30.390
but how about we have people tell you a story and I'll film it and edit it.

150
00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:34.450
And I was resistant to it.
I was like,
that's not my idea.

151
00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.920
My idea was this PR video that I want to like send out,
like to help me in these,

152
00:08:37.921 --> 00:08:42.550
this outreach,
you know?
And uh,
but he was like,
I'm not interested in that.

153
00:08:42.551 --> 00:08:45.850
Like this,
you know?
So there was a little,
you know,
and I was,
okay,
let's do some,

154
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:50.140
some,
I dunno,
video stories.
And he came to New York,
we filmed two of them.

155
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:55.240
And,
uh,
they not only were a hit,
they are now the focus.

156
00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:59.620
What I'm from,
just what it is today,
which are these weekly videos,
stories,
uh,

157
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.950
that we,
that we publish every Wednesday.
So,
um,
it was all because of Marquez.

158
00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:08.790
Who's,
who's now a board member.
I was like,
oh,
you have really good ideas.
And a,

159
00:09:08.791 --> 00:09:12.390
so actually,
do you want to watch a video story?
Yeah,
yeah,
let's do it.

160
00:09:12.391 --> 00:09:15.150
So we've got a couple of videos here for,
for you to see.

161
00:09:15.151 --> 00:09:16.370
So let me make sure my click,

162
00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:17.913
<v 3>there we go.</v>

163
00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:22.540
<v 4>Hi,
my name is not buyer Schmidt.</v>

164
00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:27.490
I'm from kinds when New Jersey and when I was 15 years old,
I was,
um,

165
00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:33.210
all my family computer talking on AOL chat rooms and just to meet people and

166
00:09:34.451 --> 00:09:37.630
meet other guys.
And you know,
unbeknownst to rest of my family,

167
00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:42.670
I'm in the mail from Elle Chat Room and,
uh,
I'm talking to this guy and he's,

168
00:09:42.671 --> 00:09:45.760
you know,
back in the day you maybe got one picture from somebody,

169
00:09:45.761 --> 00:09:47.890
like it took like five minutes for one picture to upload,

170
00:09:47.891 --> 00:09:52.270
so you had to like take what you can get 15,
he's probably like in his thirties,

171
00:09:52.271 --> 00:09:56.530
and yet no one knows my age.
I'm telling you I'm older,
but,
um,

172
00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:00.070
so I sky's very eager to meet me and very,
um,
you know,

173
00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:04.000
just kind of giving me negative vibes.
But I'm desperate to meet somebody.

174
00:10:04.001 --> 00:10:06.400
I want to just have a connection with somebody and you know,
um,

175
00:10:06.401 --> 00:10:11.340
so I just have a really weird feeling about him.
So when I go to,
um,

176
00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:15.580
before I go to meet him,
I literally have to like sneak out my parents house.
Um,

177
00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:19.480
and,
um,
I take a kitchen knife with me just to like be safe.

178
00:10:19.481 --> 00:10:20.314
And I thought that would like,

179
00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.710
it was one of those old like eighties would handle it.
Like,
you know,

180
00:10:23.711 --> 00:10:25.390
kitchen knives.
I wouldn't like cut a carrot,

181
00:10:25.391 --> 00:10:27.520
but I thought it would kill somebody.
So I take the kitchen knife,

182
00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:31.150
go back to my room and I sneak out my first story window,

183
00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:34.900
hopped to the ground and I walk about a half mile to this river near my parents'

184
00:10:34.901 --> 00:10:37.090
house.
Told the guy when I was wearing,
and he,

185
00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.630
we agreed on the time to meet and no cell phones.
So we have to tell them,

186
00:10:40.631 --> 00:10:43.510
you know,
I'll meet you at this time and you just go down there and wait.

187
00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:48.190
So he picks me up and we drive to this like I think one of the parking lots

188
00:10:48.191 --> 00:10:53.050
along the river and it's dark and you know,
I'm not really into him,

189
00:10:53.051 --> 00:10:56.950
but he's like,
he's at hideous but just not really into him.
And you know,

190
00:10:56.951 --> 00:11:01.090
he's in the May and you know,
I've already come all this way and you know,

191
00:11:01.091 --> 00:11:04.930
so I feel obligated to do something.
So I ended up,

192
00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:10.510
you know,
fully around the guy and I was a little nervous,
but um,

193
00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.330
ends that,
that like,
you know,

194
00:11:13.331 --> 00:11:18.331
we end up falling around maybe 10 minutes and afterwards I like get out of the

195
00:11:19.631 --> 00:11:22.600
car immediately and I just start heading home.

196
00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.090
I don't know if it was that night or the next night,
but I'm like,

197
00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:28.780
I'm online again and I get an email from him saying like,
you know,

198
00:11:28.781 --> 00:11:32.740
it was nice to meet you.
I'm just making a nice guy and you know,

199
00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:36.880
you forgot your knife and my car.
And I just like was like mortified.

200
00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:38.350
But you know,
also,
um,

201
00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:41.740
they don't really care because I was petrified at the time and you know,

202
00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:45.130
glad I brought it.
So flash forward to a few months later,

203
00:11:45.131 --> 00:11:46.450
I'm back in south jersey,

204
00:11:46.451 --> 00:11:50.440
male for male chatting with people and I've been chatting with this one guy for

205
00:11:50.441 --> 00:11:52.960
a while.
One kid for a while,
I remember his name,

206
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:56.890
screen name was keg killer and I was blue swoosh,
um,

207
00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:00.730
81 as my birthday and I'm like,
he was Swiss shit.
But,
um,

208
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:04.660
I ended up and we tried it for awhile and I had a feeling he was legit and real

209
00:12:04.661 --> 00:12:08.740
and my blue,
we chatted about stuff.
I knew he was my age live nearby.

210
00:12:08.741 --> 00:12:10.660
I really wanted to meet him,
but he did not want to meet me.

211
00:12:10.661 --> 00:12:12.520
He was very skeptical about it,
very scared about it.

212
00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:16.300
But he asked to actually dropped where he worked randomly in conversation one

213
00:12:16.301 --> 00:12:20.950
time.
So,
um,
I,
it was a movie theater,

214
00:12:20.951 --> 00:12:25.951
so I asked my friend Liz to go to the movies with me and it was the glossy go

215
00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:30.820
ball hunting and I think it was like a 96,
97 at this time point.

216
00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:33.130
And um,
I knew was that his movie theater.

217
00:12:33.131 --> 00:12:36.670
So I just randomly went there one night to go see it.
And when I got there,

218
00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.450
the guy taking my ticket,
like it resembled him,
I resembled his stats,

219
00:12:40.451 --> 00:12:44.350
remember what his,
I was like,
okay,
that's him.
That's him.
So we went to the movie,

220
00:12:44.351 --> 00:12:47.920
got inside of the movie and like halfway through the movie I come back out and I

221
00:12:47.921 --> 00:12:49.600
make sure I buy,
like I have some candy.

222
00:12:49.601 --> 00:12:52.240
I make sure I make eye contact with him and made sure that like we have some

223
00:12:52.241 --> 00:12:54.190
sort of interaction,
not like talking about,

224
00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:58.420
I made sure he saw me the next night or the night after.
I'm online again,

225
00:12:58.421 --> 00:13:01.720
hope and I'll sign on so I can tell him I went to his work and he ends up

226
00:13:01.721 --> 00:13:04.780
signing on and I am chatting with him.
I'm like,
Hey,
you know,
I went to your work.

227
00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:08.530
I think I follow you.
I was burying this.
I said hi to you.

228
00:13:08.531 --> 00:13:12.820
And he remembered me and um,
was willing to meet me now.

229
00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:16.480
So we ended up meeting like that night or night after.
I can't exactly remember,

230
00:13:16.481 --> 00:13:18.160
but um,
you know,

231
00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:22.090
from then on we were like instant friends and we had this like,
um,

232
00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:26.350
it was my first gay friend ever.
I made.
And uh,
we have so much in common.

233
00:13:26.351 --> 00:13:29.560
He lived right near me.
He was in high school too.
And,
you know,

234
00:13:29.561 --> 00:13:33.100
I had like my first gay friend that I can do anything with and we ended up just

235
00:13:33.101 --> 00:13:34.360
like being

236
00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.770
going to the city and experiencing everything together for the next 10 years.

237
00:13:38.771 --> 00:13:43.240
And it was like something that I didn't know I needed until I had it.

238
00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:47.980
When I found Jeff,
I was able to be myself,
be honest,
be um,
just be me.

239
00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:52.030
When I was 15,
I had a,
I had to find people online because in 1996,

240
00:13:52.031 --> 00:13:53.680
there wasn't anything else.
But like,
you know,

241
00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:57.310
I think today I think it's important to have safe spaces were,
um,

242
00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:00.490
young queer youth can go meet other people like them.

243
00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.030
So we're not putting themselves in these weird predicaments.

244
00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.370
Like I was meeting a complete stranger down by the river with a knife.

245
00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:09.100
That's not like,
it's funny now to think about it,
but like,

246
00:14:09.101 --> 00:14:12.850
it's also really scary and,
um,
I don't want anybody to be in that position,

247
00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:17.440
you know.
So I think anybody who's young in the closet or you know,

248
00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:19.420
not even in the closet,
but it's still needs allies,

249
00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:21.670
they need to find safe spaces near them.

250
00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:25.060
You need that you meet people like you going through the same thing as you,

251
00:14:25.061 --> 00:14:27.820
so you can like,
you know,
make mistakes with them,

252
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:31.300
learn from their mistakes and like,
you know,
and help each other out.

253
00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:32.243
<v 3>It's important.</v>

254
00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:39.853
Yeah.

255
00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:46.300
<v 1>Okay.
I'm not as good at this clicker thing I was going to be.
So,
um,</v>

256
00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:49.940
can you tell us a little bit about this video and why you decided to include it

257
00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:52.040
in today's talk?
We have a others as well,
so I've

258
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.100
<v 2>got more to come.
Yeah.
So,
um,</v>

259
00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:58.040
early on I knew that I didn't want to or I knew a couple of things.

260
00:14:58.041 --> 00:15:01.390
One is I wanted to make sure that this was not a coming out story site and it

261
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.570
was very important to me to,

262
00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:06.860
to share stories that capture the queer experience as opposed to this one moment

263
00:15:06.861 --> 00:15:08.690
in everyone's life.
Um,

264
00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:13.460
and so the only prompt that I give the storytellers is to share a story from

265
00:15:13.461 --> 00:15:14.090
your life,

266
00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:19.090
this meaningful to you involving Ubn Lgbtq and some storytellers.

267
00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:21.850
You're like,
that's not very good direction.
Like,

268
00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:23.960
I intentionally leave it very open.

269
00:15:23.961 --> 00:15:27.890
I don't want to guide you down any sort of story or any direction that might not

270
00:15:27.891 --> 00:15:31.700
be a meaningful,
your most meaningful stories.
So,
um,

271
00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:36.410
we have a long list of thought starter questions to help people kind of think of

272
00:15:36.411 --> 00:15:40.970
what story they want to share.
Um,
but,
so this story was,
uh,
you know,

273
00:15:40.971 --> 00:15:45.640
we asked Matt to think of a story and,
uh,
you know,
the,

274
00:15:45.641 --> 00:15:49.960
the processes we emailed back and forth,
we send,
send the storyteller link,
uh,

275
00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:53.180
with a thought starter questions and a little form for them to just get in

276
00:15:53.181 --> 00:15:56.630
storytelling mode,
um,
to set the stage of what it's like.
So they,

277
00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:59.420
they understand that it's not a question and answer interview.

278
00:15:59.421 --> 00:16:03.530
It's not like a back and forth.
It's just a sharing their story with me.

279
00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:08.000
And,
uh,
so this was just a story that stuck out a lot to Matt.

280
00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:13.210
And,
uh,
so that's really,
you know,
so he shared it and you know,

281
00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:15.600
we loved it.
And,
uh,
and,

282
00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:19.610
and actually that reminds me of another really valuable learning experience that

283
00:16:19.611 --> 00:16:21.290
I had a very early on.

284
00:16:21.291 --> 00:16:24.740
It was about probably three weeks after launching the website.

285
00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:29.570
So it was very new and I was very inexperienced and very protective of I'm from

286
00:16:29.571 --> 00:16:32.210
Driftwood,
you know,
it's like,
it has to be perfect and you know,
all this stuff.

287
00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:33.290
And uh,

288
00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:37.140
but the only guidelines I had were it has to be a story and asked to be like

289
00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.880
grammatically correct.
Like it was very,
very loose,
you know,

290
00:16:40.881 --> 00:16:45.710
so I would like scan the stories and make little,
you know,
grammar and spelling,

291
00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:49.370
uh,
fixes.
But if it's a story,
um,
I would publish it.

292
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:54.670
So I received one story and this is a written story and the truth is I just

293
00:16:54.771 --> 00:16:58.850
didn't connect with it.
Uh,
whatever it was,
I just didn't like,

294
00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:02.450
I wasn't feeling it.
And this was,
you know,
again,
at a time where I was,

295
00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:07.370
I was wanting to put this,
I'm from trips was best face forward.
And so I started,

296
00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:11.590
I started a draft of an email to the storyteller explaining,
you know,
you know,

297
00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:15.140
thank you for submitting,
maybe rework it or send another one.

298
00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:18.350
And I couldn't articulate why I didn't want to publish it.

299
00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:20.690
And then I started feeling bad.
I'm like,
what am I going to say it?
Like,

300
00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:25.100
I don't like your story.
Like,
sorry,
like,
who am I to say that?
So,
um,

301
00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:28.400
so I was like,
oh,
whatever.
I'm just going to publish it.

302
00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:31.610
So I published it and one of the very first comments said,

303
00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.320
this is the best story I've read on the site.

304
00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:38.120
And I'm so glad that I learned that early on because like,

305
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:41.020
the reason it didn't connect with me is because I didn't need it to my,

306
00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:45.230
I have my life and my experiences and my history and that story.
I just,

307
00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:48.230
I didn't need that story,
but other people did.
So it,

308
00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:53.010
it allowed to really remove myself and my personal experiences from I'm from

309
00:17:53.011 --> 00:17:57.630
driftwood.
And,
uh,
so whenever people come up with a story like Matt,

310
00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.420
that was a meaningful story to him.
And,

311
00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:02.250
and it just so happens that I connect with it because I was definitely on those

312
00:18:02.251 --> 00:18:06.360
AOL in fort m chat rooms also.
But,
uh,
but that's,

313
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:07.530
that's why I'm very,

314
00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:11.440
I try to be hands off in terms of helping people think of their stories.
Uh,

315
00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:15.360
and some people have mini stories that they're thinking about and then we'll

316
00:18:15.361 --> 00:18:19.320
talk to them and,
and help them,
you know,
uh,
develop,

317
00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.090
develop the more,
so

318
00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:24.670
<v 1>yeah,
it's,
I think it's really fascinating and an archive like this,</v>

319
00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:28.300
the diversity of experience that you find.
Um,

320
00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:33.010
so I would encourage everybody to go and take a look at the site which has this

321
00:18:33.011 --> 00:18:36.370
video archive and you can really find an enormous number of different kinds of

322
00:18:36.371 --> 00:18:39.880
stories from people with very,
very wide ranging,
uh,

323
00:18:39.881 --> 00:18:43.860
experiences of identifying as Lgbtq at various,
you know,
in,

324
00:18:43.861 --> 00:18:48.160
in various stages of their journey throughout life.

325
00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:53.590
Um,
but I'm curious also if you saw some recurring themes,

326
00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:58.030
did you have certain things that kept circling up for you that even as you were

327
00:18:58.031 --> 00:19:02.200
stepping away from being personally invested in or connecting with every story?

328
00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:04.180
Um,
did you,

329
00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:07.540
did you find that interesting things were popping up over and over again?

330
00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:12.430
<v 2>Not generally at first.
Uh,</v>

331
00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:17.650
and it actually leads me to talking about the stories tore because at first we

332
00:19:17.841 --> 00:19:20.870
were collecting video stories from people.
Uh,
we had no money.

333
00:19:20.871 --> 00:19:23.450
We had an organization that was just like doing what we could.

334
00:19:23.451 --> 00:19:24.980
So we had to do what was easiest,

335
00:19:24.981 --> 00:19:29.060
which was collect stories and New York and Philadelphia where at Marquee slips

336
00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:31.190
and the store.

337
00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:34.950
The good thing about New York and Philly is that they're such international,
uh,

338
00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:39.260
cities.
So people are from everywhere here in New York.
Uh,

339
00:19:39.261 --> 00:19:41.630
so it was good because we were getting some diverse stories,

340
00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:44.600
but I felt like we were cheating a little bit,
uh,

341
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:46.700
because all the people here decided to move here.

342
00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:50.190
And that is a different kind of person that people who decide to stay in their

343
00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:54.980
hometowns.
So that was where the idea of the 50 state stories where it came from.

344
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:57.080
I was like,
we're not getting,
you know,
we're,

345
00:19:57.081 --> 00:19:59.300
we're doing a good job of getting diverse stories,

346
00:19:59.301 --> 00:20:02.870
but we need to really get out there.
And,
uh,
so I,

347
00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:06.980
I pitched the idea to Marquees and uh,
he was like,

348
00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.680
he had a nice cushy job,
you know,
in Philly.

349
00:20:09.681 --> 00:20:12.980
And of course I'm scrambling to do what I can to turn this into an organization.

350
00:20:12.981 --> 00:20:17.270
And so I'm like,
let's go to all 50 states,
you know,
and he's like,
he's like,

351
00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:21.650
how is that possible?
Like,
let's do like a a five day,

352
00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:25.370
three city tour in the northeast,
you know,
let's start there,
build some interest.

353
00:20:25.371 --> 00:20:26.120
And I was like,
no,
no,
no,

354
00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:29.510
no one's going to care about a three city tour and over five days we have to do

355
00:20:29.511 --> 00:20:31.070
it big and has to be,
you know,

356
00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:34.040
I'm from driftwoods 50 state stories where it has to be,
you know,

357
00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:36.890
stories from all over the country.
And

358
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:43.310
about six months later,
uh,
and a lot of convincing and conversations,

359
00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:45.080
um,
he,

360
00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:50.230
we decided to do it and I bought a van,
mapped it all out.

361
00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:52.930
And you did it by vehicle?
We drove,

362
00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:57.110
we flew to Alaska and Hawaii.
Yeah,

363
00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:01.410
we thought about getting a duck vans so we could drive to Hawaii.
But no.
Um,

364
00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:02.490
so yeah,
we,

365
00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:07.490
we drove to all 48 states and then flew to Hawaii from Hawaii to Alaska then,

366
00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:14.440
yeah,
back to the 48 states and it took over four months.
And,
uh,

367
00:21:14.441 --> 00:21:17.110
so,
uh,
to answer your question,

368
00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:20.840
that was when we noticed a trend because it was,
I,

369
00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:24.790
I guess there's a trend I guess,
of me setting rules for myself,
but I was like,

370
00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:29.680
I don't want to seek out specific stories.
If we are in Laramie,
Wyoming,

371
00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:33.490
I don't want to seek out and not shepard story.
If we're in the south,

372
00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:38.170
I don't want to seek out,
uh,
religious,
uh,
stories.
If we're in Utah.

373
00:21:38.171 --> 00:21:39.430
I don't want to seek out Mormon stories.

374
00:21:39.431 --> 00:21:42.910
I just like wanted the stories to happen and stick to our guns and say whatever

375
00:21:42.911 --> 00:21:43.750
story you want to share.

376
00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:49.080
And I'm glad we did that because that is the best way to notice a trend of,

377
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:54.070
you know,
without,
uh,
Swain at any certain way.
And,

378
00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:59.440
uh,
so it,
it,
and the trend was something that I didn't predict.

379
00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:00.440
It was a,

380
00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:04.000
we did presentations like story sharing events at colleges and universities.

381
00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:07.120
And whenever I did,
I would ask people,
they're like,

382
00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:11.080
what does it like being Lgbtq here and,
uh,

383
00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:13.090
in Kansas,
you know,

384
00:22:13.091 --> 00:22:16.960
and the answers consistently were the smaller the town,

385
00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:22.290
the more the youth or community wanted to challenge the perception of the rest

386
00:22:22.871 --> 00:22:24.970
of the country about their small town.
And they're like,

387
00:22:24.971 --> 00:22:29.230
just because we're in a small town doesn't mean we're backwards.
Idiots.
Like,

388
00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:33.730
you know,
knuckle draggers,
like were I,
my family is supportive of me.

389
00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:36.310
My,
you know,
my school,
I'm out of school.

390
00:22:36.311 --> 00:22:40.420
Like they were really challenging this perception of Kansas or wherever we were

391
00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:44.740
being this,
you know,
terrible small town and they're like,
it's not that way.

392
00:22:44.741 --> 00:22:47.620
Like we don't have protections.
We,
they were very honest and real about it,

393
00:22:47.621 --> 00:22:48.670
but they were like,
just,
you know,

394
00:22:48.671 --> 00:22:51.310
everyone thinks that they hear I'm from Kansas and they think,
oh,

395
00:22:51.311 --> 00:22:54.790
it must be so terrible.
And there are rooms for improvement,

396
00:22:54.791 --> 00:22:58.840
but it's not this terrible place to be.
And,
uh,

397
00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:03.070
then the opposite was true in the big cities,
the same but opposite.
So it was,

398
00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:07.290
we were in,
uh,
West Hollywood,
at the La Center.
Um,

399
00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:12.730
and it's west Hollywood,
like the gay us of the gay,
you know,
and,
uh,
all these,
uh,

400
00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.700
there was probably 18 to,
or maybe even 16 to 24,

401
00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:20.050
a youth group had a meeting and we shared stories and I almost didn't even ask

402
00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:21.700
because this is beautiful.

403
00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.580
Like there's so much money behind it and their center and it was new and

404
00:23:24.581 --> 00:23:28.870
renovated.
And,
uh,
but I was like,
I shouldn't ask.
I was like,
what's it like being,

405
00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:32.920
you know,
Lgbtq here in West Hollywood,
you know,

406
00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:35.020
and all their hands shot up.
And they're like,

407
00:23:35.021 --> 00:23:37.030
just because we're in west Hollywood doesn't mean it's easy.

408
00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:40.990
And I don't live in West Hollywood.
I live with my parents.
They,

409
00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:44.980
I had to sneak out to be here.
They don't know I'm gay.
My friend was kicked out.

410
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:49.430
So it was the same idea of challenging the perception of what the world sees

411
00:23:49.431 --> 00:23:51.950
them as,
um,
and kind of turning that on its head.

412
00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:56.780
And basically everyone was saying,
we're unique.
We're,
we're,

413
00:23:56.870 --> 00:24:01.430
there's not a broad stroke that you can paint for our town or city.
And,
um,

414
00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:04.550
but they all wanted,
you know,
it was like pay attention to us,
to us,

415
00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:07.110
not our town or city.
So that was,
uh,

416
00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:10.220
the biggest trend I saw a on this story tour.

417
00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:14.900
<v 1>That's really good to hear.
I'm glad that that was the trend and not something,</v>

418
00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:18.260
you know,
worse or more difficult.
Yeah.
Yeah.

419
00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:20.270
Good to hear that people were challenging,

420
00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:23.600
able to challenge their perceptions of their small towns as someone who grew up

421
00:24:23.601 --> 00:24:27.200
in a relatively small town in the middle of New Mexico,

422
00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:29.390
which at the time with,
um,

423
00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:34.840
probably also a place in which people would imagine it being not particularly

424
00:24:35.751 --> 00:24:37.340
LGBTQ friendly.
Um,

425
00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:41.110
I actually didn't want to challenge that perception so much cause I think that

426
00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:43.790
at the time it was personal,
a pretty difficult place to grow up.
But I,

427
00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:48.500
I can understand the impetus is thrive Tryon,
um,
you know,

428
00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:53.270
give a real understanding for folks who don't live there of what it's actually

429
00:24:53.271 --> 00:24:56.690
like to be from that place as an LGBTQ person.
So,

430
00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:59.730
<v 2>yeah.
Yeah.
I feel like there's a balance.
Like people are like,
yeah,</v>

431
00:24:59.731 --> 00:25:02.760
like there's pride.
It's like,
I'm from here.
I like it.
I love it.

432
00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:05.520
There's an issue is,
but hey,
it's not,
you know,
there's,

433
00:25:05.521 --> 00:25:10.080
it's not all the way one or the other.
There is a balance.
And,
um,
yeah,

434
00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:12.220
<v 1>that's great.
Um,</v>

435
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.730
at what point did you start to have an understanding of,
um,

436
00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:20.290
where you needed to broaden out your demographics?

437
00:25:20.291 --> 00:25:25.150
So you were talking in particular about looking at the stories of older Lgbtq

438
00:25:25.151 --> 00:25:27.490
folks who are,
is often a part of our,

439
00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:31.570
our community that can be either not properly cared for,

440
00:25:31.571 --> 00:25:35.240
not properly highlighted or sometimes even a silenced and,

441
00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:40.270
and a variety of ways.
So I'm using that as an example,
sort of,

442
00:25:40.271 --> 00:25:44.140
where was the fork in the road where you realized that that broadening

443
00:25:44.141 --> 00:25:45.760
demographics would be really helpful?

444
00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:49.600
<v 2>Pretty early on,
we knew that we wanted to,
um,</v>

445
00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:53.900
make sure that the stories represented the diversity of the community,
which is,

446
00:25:53.901 --> 00:25:54.530
I mean,

447
00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:57.500
there's no community more diverse than the LGBT community because we're every,

448
00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:00.710
every part of every community.
So,
uh,

449
00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:06.380
it was always a focus,
but,
um,
it was,

450
00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:10.850
it wasn't until we would say the process is we help storytellers come up with a

451
00:26:10.851 --> 00:26:13.190
single story to share from their life.

452
00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:18.170
And what would happen whenever we would get a story from somebody who's older is

453
00:26:18.171 --> 00:26:19.130
that we would,
you know,

454
00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:22.610
work with them on the phone and figure out a single story and we would show up

455
00:26:22.611 --> 00:26:27.470
to film and,
you know,
let's say for example,
the story is about,
you know,

456
00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:30.860
they fell in love at age 50,
but then we show up with cameras and they're like,

457
00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:36.650
when I was 14 and I was like,
what?
Like wait,
we're looking at my notes late,

458
00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:41.090
uh,
late,
listen.
And they try to cram in their entire life into this story.
And we,

459
00:26:41.091 --> 00:26:43.010
and we try to keep,
the video is about five,

460
00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:47.550
five to six minutes because we want to make sure people watch them.
And if,

461
00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:49.710
if we upload a 25 minute video,

462
00:26:49.711 --> 00:26:53.130
like it's unlikely people are gonna Watch the whole thing.
So,
uh,

463
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:58.190
there's this balance of needing to have shareable and viewable content while,

464
00:26:59.660 --> 00:26:59.940
you know,

465
00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:02.550
making sure that we respect the storyteller and the story they want to share.

466
00:27:02.551 --> 00:27:06.330
So with elders,
we were just like,

467
00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:08.880
then we felt bad because we'd publish their story and they're like,

468
00:27:08.881 --> 00:27:12.150
what about this and this and this.
Then I talked about and we're like,
it's just,

469
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:15.420
you know,
it was too long.
We don't think people would watch it.

470
00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:19.920
So they would be a little sad by that and we feel like we let them down.

471
00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:24.870
So we wanted to come up with a way to kind of have this compromise of like,

472
00:27:24.871 --> 00:27:25.920
what can we do to,

473
00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:31.130
and also elders have no one in the community ever will have see as much history

474
00:27:32.281 --> 00:27:35.190
and change in the community as our elders right now.

475
00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:39.330
They have been arrested for dancing with people at the same gender and now they

476
00:27:39.331 --> 00:27:42.630
can marry people with the same gender and that won't exist in 20 years.

477
00:27:42.631 --> 00:27:45.470
And it didn't exist 20 years ago.
And,
uh,
so it's,

478
00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:49.480
we also knew the importance and value of documenting and preserving their

479
00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:54.390
history.
Um,
so we came up with this new program called,
what was it like an,

480
00:27:54.391 --> 00:27:57.790
a specifically stories of Lgbtq elders.
And,
uh,

481
00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:01.380
the way that program works is that we,
instead of having them share one story,
uh,

482
00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:05.190
we helped them figure out six to eight individual stories in their life.

483
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:07.200
So it's still,
every story has an arc.

484
00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:10.620
Every story has an individual conflict and resolution.
Uh,

485
00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:12.930
so then we can share them individually.
Uh,

486
00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:16.080
but it also gives them the opportunity to share their whole life,

487
00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:19.000
but still through individual stories.
So,
uh,

488
00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:22.320
we launched that about a year and a half ago and it's,

489
00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:26.070
it's been incredible.
Um,
it's the,

490
00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:30.360
the content has,
I mean,
we,
we,

491
00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:34.760
we talk a lot like,
you know,
behind the scenes.
But,
you know,
even Damian,
my,

492
00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:37.640
my colleague and the videographer and editor,
he says,
um,

493
00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:41.850
the stories from elders or they're just better.
I mean,
because they have so much,

494
00:28:41.851 --> 00:28:44.220
there's so,
such different history and,
you know,

495
00:28:44.221 --> 00:28:47.850
younger people have fewer stories to choose from.
So,
um,
it's,

496
00:28:47.851 --> 00:28:52.380
it's really been just an incredible,
um,
new program that we're happy with.

497
00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:57.380
And we actually,
we have a story from an elder if we're ready to watch.
Yes.
It's,

498
00:28:57.450 --> 00:28:59.580
we're gonna have to skip Alexis.
Yeah.
Okay.

499
00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:04.600
<v 1>So give me just one second to do my clicker.
There we go.
It was,
here it is.
Right.</v>

500
00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:11.723
<v 5>Um,</v>

501
00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:16.940
in 1997 give or take a year or two,

502
00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:22.080
I was working out on fire island,
a barrier island

503
00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:26.370
off of long island.

504
00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:31.820
And I worked at this little restaurant called El hot spot.

505
00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:38.240
It was a Mexican restaurant with a generic name breaths.

506
00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:39.990
Again,
no Mexican name.

507
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:45.470
And I told that I could wear anything I wanted and in fact they encourage me to

508
00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:51.070
dress up,
be myself.

509
00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:55.120
I was wearing to church dresses,
sort of what hats,

510
00:29:55.300 --> 00:30:00.190
sometimes all different kinds of wigs.
And um,

511
00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:03.850
I didn't know much about makeup,

512
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.050
but I had some girlfriends that started to help me with the makeup and stuff.

513
00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:10.240
I was given this creative freedom.

514
00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:15.700
I had basically lived as a gay man and,

515
00:30:15.701 --> 00:30:16.534
um,

516
00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:21.670
parole hadn't emerged yet and so I was wearing,

517
00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:27.250
I just tried to put together things that I could find.
They had a lot of,

518
00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:28.930
uh,
I was wearing,

519
00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:34.170
they would have a lot of their old drag queens out on the island would retire

520
00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:38.220
and they're dragging.
They would,
they would put it up at,

521
00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:43.440
at a yard sales and I would go shopping.

522
00:30:43.441 --> 00:30:45.610
That's where I did my shopping in the beginning,

523
00:30:45.611 --> 00:30:50.530
cause I dare not go to any store,
the buy women's clothing.

524
00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:53.930
And so I was,
uh,

525
00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:58.150
getting ready to come into the city and I was going to go through my whole

526
00:30:58.151 --> 00:30:58.984
routine,

527
00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:04.740
put on my back into my male clothing and get ready to come back.

528
00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:05.621
Simple.

529
00:31:05.621 --> 00:31:10.621
I've done it a thousand times and at that time I couldn't get it together.

530
00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:16.200
I couldn't change my clothes and I couldn't get out of my drag to go back into

531
00:31:17.261 --> 00:31:21.550
the city.
And I felt so schizophrenia [inaudible] Aye,
Aye.

532
00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:26.200
And I started talking to myself.
I said,
okay,
now Pearl,
come on off it.

533
00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:31.030
Uh,
or I might've even talked to Ken.
I said,
okay,

534
00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:35.980
chop chop,
let's get it together.
Let's get on that boat,
take off these clothes.

535
00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:41.890
And it was like Pearl came out of me and said,

536
00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:46.870
I'm not taking them off.
It was like,
I said,

537
00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:49.240
what?
As he said,

538
00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:54.390
I'm not taking this dress off and I'm holding a conversation with myself.

539
00:31:56.810 --> 00:32:00.280
I said,
of course you are.
I said,
we can't go.

540
00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:05.650
And so I went up to the ice palace and I remember talking to one of the,

541
00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:08.440
uh,
one of the entertainers,
they aren't,
I said,

542
00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:13.270
I'm going back into the city just like this.
And he said,

543
00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:14.410
no,
Pearl,

544
00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:19.810
you got to take it off because you could be beat up or you could be,
I said,

545
00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:25.100
Pearl won't take,
let me take the drag along.
So I know they probably said,

546
00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:28.240
just tells,
been drawing a little too many drugs.

547
00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:31.570
So I ran home,
got my bag,

548
00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:35.410
got my stuff and I got on the boat.

549
00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:40.740
It was the most surreal trip across the bay from Cherry Grove back to save hill.

550
00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:49.030
And I'm on the way in and people are looking and,

551
00:32:49.341 --> 00:32:52.820
um,
and I looked just like what I am.

552
00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:58.330
And I go in and I remember walking through Penn station and I'm in a flowing

553
00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:04.070
something people.
And when I looked like in my weight,

554
00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:08.400
you know how you walk past somebody and if you look back real quick in your

555
00:33:08.401 --> 00:33:12.230
weight,
there's all these people,
they're angry.

556
00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.420
Like what?

557
00:33:14.050 --> 00:33:19.050
And I get on the subway and I catch the train on back down this way.

558
00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:25.980
Now it's getting ready to just throw everything out that I thought I was a gay

559
00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:35.890
black man living with HIV.

560
00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:43.140
And now this new new something has emerged that was peaking out all the time pro

561
00:33:48.731 --> 00:33:52.180
with there.
She didn't have a name,
but she was there.

562
00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:57.540
Everything up to this point had led to me,

563
00:33:57.980 --> 00:33:58.813
uh,

564
00:34:00.130 --> 00:34:05.130
being true to myself as a transgender woman.

565
00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:08.380
And I,
at that point,

566
00:34:08.410 --> 00:34:13.410
I had no idea what that meant because for the next 16 years it was,

567
00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:18.300
and it still continue.
Today.
It's,

568
00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:21.350
it's been a journey and I wouldn't trade it

569
00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:30.050
<v 2>so</v>

570
00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:34.860
<v 1>clearly.
Um,
you know,
a lot of these stories,
again,
uh,</v>

571
00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:38.730
it's just really wonderful being able to see each of these stories on the

572
00:34:38.731 --> 00:34:39.410
archive.
It's,

573
00:34:39.410 --> 00:34:42.780
it's such an incredible experience that sort of jumped into other people's
lives.

574
00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:47.160
Um,
all those mirror neurons getting fired up.
Um,

575
00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:47.851
but I'm curious,

576
00:34:47.851 --> 00:34:52.590
it's actually leads us really nicely into a part of what you came here to talk

577
00:34:52.591 --> 00:34:54.660
about,
which was,
um,

578
00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:59.810
having all of this be a digital platform and have it be an internet based,

579
00:35:01.651 --> 00:35:06.590
particularly when we're talking about Lgbtq elders who may have told stories,
um,

580
00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:10.860
prior to this becoming an easy platform to access in very different ways.

581
00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:15.890
So I'm curious how you see that playing in an influencing this project sort of

582
00:35:16.051 --> 00:35:17.460
as a,
at,
at its core.

583
00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:20.310
<v 2>Yeah.
I mean,
it simply wouldn't exist if it,</v>

584
00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:23.970
if we weren't in the Internet age right now and,
uh,

585
00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:27.780
without youtube and ways to share all these stories because it's,

586
00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:32.710
our focus has always been on getting these stories out to,
uh,

587
00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:37.350
uh,
uh,
a home in,
you know,
Idaho somewhere.

588
00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:40.410
Like it's,
uh,
that's the,

589
00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:44.350
that's what makes [inaudible] special I think is it's accessibility,
uh,

590
00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:48.600
freely accessible to anyone with an internet connection.
And,

591
00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:52.560
uh,
that's,
it's,
that's what's special about it.
I mean,

592
00:35:52.561 --> 00:35:54.930
we look at our analytics and this,
the,
uh,

593
00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:57.750
most of our views do come from the bigger states,
but,
uh,

594
00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:01.920
just knowing that they'd been seen from every country in the world and,
uh,
it,

595
00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:06.030
it wouldn't own,
I can't understate it,
it wouldn't exist without a,

596
00:36:06.031 --> 00:36:09.570
where we are today with the Internet.
Um,
so it's,
it's,

597
00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:13.980
the name itself is like its,
you know,
Talon focused,
geography focused.

598
00:36:13.981 --> 00:36:18.040
It's um,
you know,
really all about getting our stories out there.
Um,

599
00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:20.520
that said,
we,

600
00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:21.693
<v 6>yeah,</v>

601
00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:24.460
<v 2>there is an element of,
um,</v>

602
00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:26.953
<v 6>yeah,</v>

603
00:36:27.110 --> 00:36:30.160
<v 2>like I dunno,
like it becomes a little bit impersonal for,</v>

604
00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:33.250
especially for me because I spend so much time on just like a computer sharing

605
00:36:33.251 --> 00:36:37.240
these stories and it's becomes so digital that it loses a little bit of heart

606
00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:41.500
sometimes.
Um,
and I can't tell if that's just me because it's my job,
uh,

607
00:36:41.501 --> 00:36:43.840
or uh,
or what,
but because of that,

608
00:36:43.841 --> 00:36:48.841
we started having more community events where we screen stories and public

609
00:36:49.061 --> 00:36:53.260
places and me have storyteller spotlights.
So Pearl for example,

610
00:36:53.261 --> 00:36:57.550
was one of our first featured storyteller spotlights where we screen a few of

611
00:36:57.551 --> 00:37:01.090
her stories and she's there with a moderator and there's questions from the

612
00:37:01.091 --> 00:37:02.410
audience.
So,
you know,

613
00:37:02.411 --> 00:37:05.410
you see these stories and then you can actually ask the storyteller questions.

614
00:37:05.411 --> 00:37:10.060
So it kind of takes it offline.
Uh,
so as much as we're focusing on online,

615
00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:14.980
uh,
we're now,
I think maybe is humans in general.

616
00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:15.441
Like we've,

617
00:37:15.441 --> 00:37:19.420
we've been so focused on online and digital and phones now we're like,
wait,

618
00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:21.580
I missed this,
like personal connection.

619
00:37:21.581 --> 00:37:26.140
And we're kind of like correcting that a little bit.
Um,
so I,
I,

620
00:37:26.170 --> 00:37:29.800
I'm glad that we now have these ways of experiencing.
I'm from driftwood offline.

621
00:37:29.801 --> 00:37:30.940
So yeah,

622
00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:34.840
<v 1>that's really the,
having the compliment is really cool.
Um,</v>

623
00:37:34.841 --> 00:37:38.480
so online storytelling,
um,
clearly doesn't have,
uh,

624
00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:42.730
a very long history,
certainly not in comparison to storytelling more broadly,

625
00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:45.640
but,
um,
so we don't have a ton of precedent too though off,

626
00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:50.290
but I'm curious as somebody who is involved on a daily basis,
um,

627
00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:55.380
in curating LGBTQ stories in the online space,

628
00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:59.380
do you have sense for how online storytelling,

629
00:37:59.381 --> 00:38:03.790
particularly around Lgbtq stories is going to develop over the next five,

630
00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:08.350
10 years?
Like what,
what do you see coming up for online storytelling?

631
00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:09.470
<v 2>I think,</v>

632
00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:14.320
and I think just generally it's going to become decentralized and,

633
00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:19.060
uh,
we're actually trying to put together a,
uh,
a youth committee,
uh,

634
00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:23.530
to help us figure out if,
cause nine years is a long time for the Internet.

635
00:38:23.531 --> 00:38:27.610
Like it so much has changed.
You know,
Instagram didn't exist when we started.
So,

636
00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:31.320
uh,
what I want to figure out is what I'm from trips,

637
00:38:31.321 --> 00:38:34.390
what it would look like today if it started,
if it started today,

638
00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:40.510
it would probably not be a centralized website.
Uh,
it would be more of,

639
00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:44.650
I mean a Hashtag or something and it's not all living on one place.

640
00:38:44.651 --> 00:38:47.870
It's everywhere.
Uh,
and you can look at,
you know,
like the,

641
00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:50.650
the me too movement that is not a centralized,

642
00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:56.210
it's storytelling and it's a singular theme and it's everywhere.

643
00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:01.150
There's not a single place to go there.
So I think that,
uh,
I think,
yeah,

644
00:39:01.151 --> 00:39:05.800
it,
storytelling is going to become a decentralized,
I guess.

645
00:39:05.801 --> 00:39:10.570
Is it maybe a,
a dry answer,
but I think that's like where it's going.
Um,
just the,

646
00:39:10.571 --> 00:39:13.840
the Internet in general is less,
you look at blogs now,
like they just,

647
00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:18.130
they're not as many blogs.
Like people don't go to places and I'm like,

648
00:39:18.131 --> 00:39:18.941
bookmarks and stuff.

649
00:39:18.941 --> 00:39:22.780
It's now just what you read on Instagram or Facebook or Twitter,

650
00:39:22.781 --> 00:39:24.460
but it's all kind of,

651
00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:27.220
I feel like everything's been taken and chicken up and just like thrown out

652
00:39:27.221 --> 00:39:29.860
there.
So I think it's going to be similar for storytelling.

653
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:34.730
<v 1>Just saying,
how do you find,
um,
sort of navigating that space,</v>

654
00:39:34.731 --> 00:39:38.690
knowing that it's become becoming decentralized and clearly there are lots of

655
00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:43.470
options for where folks can go to find LGBTQ stories.
So,
um,

656
00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:47.150
do you find it a challenge to try and get,
I'm from Driftwood,
uh,

657
00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:52.180
into a unique enough space that it's still kind of like holding its own and what

658
00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:57.080
can be just a competitive,
as you say,
decentralized space on the Internet?

659
00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:00.210
<v 2>Yeah,
it's,
the challenge for us is,
you know,</v>

660
00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:03.170
we're trying to plan five years in advance in 10 years in advance.

661
00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:06.350
And looking back,
it's like,
oh my God,
like five years ago,

662
00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:11.360
things change so fast and we're applying for funding for something that we're

663
00:40:11.361 --> 00:40:14.120
planning for like in a couple of years then.
But then if you get the funding,

664
00:40:14.121 --> 00:40:17.270
it's like,
wait,
actually we need to change this because of this.
And it,

665
00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:20.960
it's just a very fast paced environment obviously.
But that's,

666
00:40:20.961 --> 00:40:24.480
that's a good thing.
So it's,
it's,
that's not a complaint.
It's just,
uh,
uh,
it,
it,

667
00:40:24.481 --> 00:40:25.430
it is a challenge though.

668
00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:30.490
And I'm just trying to always keep up with it and stay relevant.

669
00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:35.750
Um,
you know,
is a,
a website the way to go or is it,

670
00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:40.640
um,
do we,
you know,
is it,
do we need 22nd video stories?

671
00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:43.480
Like is it,
is it,
you know,
and actually we have been doing,

672
00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:48.200
we've been tracking a youtube has analytics that allows you to monitor the

673
00:40:48.201 --> 00:40:49.730
percentage of the video watched.

674
00:40:50.090 --> 00:40:54.560
And early on we were very focused on less than three minutes.

675
00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:57.290
Like we kind of made it up but also looked did some research and we're like less

676
00:40:57.291 --> 00:40:58.550
than three minutes for a video story.

677
00:40:58.850 --> 00:41:01.670
And then we got a really great story that had to be closer to four minutes and

678
00:41:01.671 --> 00:41:05.150
we're like,
okay,
just this once.
But we compare those analytics and we're like,

679
00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:08.010
look,
the same percentage of people watched it and now we're at,

680
00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:11.120
some of our videos are over seven minutes and the percentage stays the same.

681
00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:16.210
So that just taught us that the story arc is it takes the primary focus and as

682
00:41:19.101 --> 00:41:20.120
long as it's a story,

683
00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:24.470
people watch it for the same amount of time as a percentage of time as they

684
00:41:24.471 --> 00:41:29.390
would for two minute story.
So,
um,
yeah,
I,
I forget how I got there,

685
00:41:29.391 --> 00:41:29.940
but okay.

686
00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:32.770
<v 1>Oh no,
that's,
that's really interesting.
I think that,
um,</v>

687
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:37.730
I know that that's not the case for all youtube videos,
right.
Plenty of them.

688
00:41:37.731 --> 00:41:39.980
You sort of drop off in the middle.
Um,

689
00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:43.280
so it's really interesting to hear that that is,
uh,
you know,

690
00:41:43.281 --> 00:41:45.800
that LGBTQ stories are really connecting,

691
00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:50.810
particularly that arc is keeping people engaged.
Um,
over the course.
I'm sure,

692
00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:53.240
you know,
on the keeping up with the technology piece,

693
00:41:53.241 --> 00:41:57.440
I know that as I get older and more crotchety,
um,

694
00:41:57.441 --> 00:41:59.960
it's actually really difficult to keep up with the new technologies that are

695
00:41:59.961 --> 00:42:03.290
coming out.
Um,
and understanding how they work.

696
00:42:03.291 --> 00:42:08.291
Like a s snapchat is just a thing that I just do not understand nor use.

697
00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:11.600
Um,
yes,

698
00:42:11.601 --> 00:42:15.740
it came along with my gray hairs a so I can imagine that that is difficult,

699
00:42:15.741 --> 00:42:18.700
but it's,
it's a really interesting space to be in.
Um,
hmm.

700
00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:20.930
<v 2>Do you use committee committee?</v>

701
00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:26.380
<v 1>So,
um,
I know that we had one more video we want to show,
which we certainly can,</v>

702
00:42:26.381 --> 00:42:30.640
but I,
before we jump into getting some questions from the audience and certainly

703
00:42:30.641 --> 00:42:32.050
showing this last video we'd like to,

704
00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:36.130
I just want to make sure that we touch on how groups like ours.

705
00:42:36.131 --> 00:42:40.480
So the gigglers is Google's Lgbtq employee resource group.
Um,

706
00:42:40.481 --> 00:42:41.590
and uh,

707
00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:46.540
how groups like the gigglers as well as other Lgbtq,
um,

708
00:42:46.570 --> 00:42:51.550
community groups or organizations can become involved with a project like this.

709
00:42:51.610 --> 00:42:56.400
Um,
either with the option to contribute or help spread the word,
etc.

710
00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:58.310
<v 2>Yeah.
There,
there are so many ways.</v>

711
00:42:58.311 --> 00:43:03.140
We a very small organization and we have very big goals of what we're trying to

712
00:43:03.141 --> 00:43:05.960

Uh,
it's,
it's,
uh,

714
00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:12.350
from what I've heard is a good process.
It's a learning process.

715
00:43:12.351 --> 00:43:15.860
You learn about storytelling and it's,
it's a,
we come to you to film your story.

718
00:43:23.121 --> 00:43:27.380

we can sometimes find videographers,
uh,
in your area.
Um,

719
00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:28.670
but sharing your story is,

720
00:43:28.671 --> 00:43:31.630
there's no better way to get to know more about the organization.
Um,

721
00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:36.110
then sharing your story.
Uh,
we,
we have like community events,

722
00:43:36.111 --> 00:43:38.520
we have volunteer opportunities,
we have this youth committee.

723
00:43:38.521 --> 00:43:42.590
So if you're knowledgeable on uh,
uh,
on all these like new,

724
00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:45.500
like we need help with Instagram and also it's just like time,

725
00:43:45.501 --> 00:43:48.670
like I'm trying to keep Instagram,
uptodate,
you know,

726
00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:52.850
with our stories and photos and,
and it's just,
we need help and guidance.

727
00:43:52.851 --> 00:43:55.610
So a social media ad words,

728
00:43:55.611 --> 00:44:00.500
we have a Google grant and like Edwards is so in depth and it's,

729
00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:05.330
it's,
yeah,
it's way beyond what I am able to do.
So I,

730
00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:07.820
we need help with that.
We need help with anything.

731
00:44:07.821 --> 00:44:12.821
So if basically if you are interested in taking part in volunteering at events

732
00:44:13.521 --> 00:44:16.330
or anything at all with a storytelling organization,
uh,

733
00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:19.520
just reach out to me and we will make sure that you're doing something that you

734
00:44:19.521 --> 00:44:20.354
enjoy.

735
00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:26.050
<v 1>That's great.
Um,
I think that in the interest of time,</v>

736
00:44:26.410 --> 00:44:29.220
we might open it up now for Q and.
A.
Um,

737
00:44:29.290 --> 00:44:32.070
unless there was anything else that you wanted to on before we

738
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:35.580
<v 2>jump into some audience questions.
No,
sounds great.
Okay,
great.</v>

739
00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:38.270
Does anybody have any questions?
Yes.
Jeff it.
Hi,
I'm Mike.

740
00:44:40.130 --> 00:44:44.030
I took a brief look at your website and you know,

741
00:44:44.031 --> 00:44:48.560
from that and from what you've,
what you've shown here,
um,
you,

742
00:44:48.561 --> 00:44:53.420
you highlight for example,
um,
transgender stories,

743
00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:56.950
uh,
gender nonbinary stories.
You talked about,
you,

744
00:44:57.050 --> 00:45:02.000
you showed a story of a community elder.
Um,

745
00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:06.770
though I didn't see a way that particularly access that on your website and it

746
00:45:06.771 --> 00:45:08.750
got me wondering whether you,

747
00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:13.100
whether there are tools there that I just didn't see that allow people to

748
00:45:13.101 --> 00:45:17.720
explore the site from the point of view of various kinds of intersectionality.

749
00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:22.580
Yes.
Uh,
so basically a way to,
uh,

750
00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:26.480
we tag all of our stories.
Uh,
so it's,
uh,

751
00:45:28.510 --> 00:45:31.530
I have like a traffic jam in my mind of like what I want to say.
So,
uh,

752
00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:36.390
we are working on a new tool right now,
which we need help with,
uh,

753
00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:40.500
from a smart developers and coders and you know,

754
00:45:40.590 --> 00:45:43.600
all that stuff that we don't know how to do.
Um,
we're,

755
00:45:43.610 --> 00:45:48.150
we want to create what's currently called a story map and it's a visual

756
00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:51.900
representation of I'm from driftwoods,
so it's literally this globe.
Um,

757
00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:53.870
and uh,
it,
it,

758
00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:57.360
there's a visual representation of every single story that we've collected and

759
00:45:57.361 --> 00:45:58.470
it's interactive,

760
00:45:58.471 --> 00:46:02.610
so you can click on it and it pulls up a preview of the story and you can filter

761
00:46:02.611 --> 00:46:05.400
those by,
uh,
our,
what was it like stories.

762
00:46:05.401 --> 00:46:08.460
You can filter it by transgender stories like sexuality,

763
00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:13.020
gender orientation or gender identity.
And,
uh,
so,

764
00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:16.650
so that is kind of stepping in that direction of making it easier to search and

765
00:46:16.651 --> 00:46:18.650
find the stories that you want.
Um,

766
00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:23.280
the website itself right now is not ideal for that.

767
00:46:23.281 --> 00:46:27.000
You can go to the search bar and type in,
um,
you know,

768
00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:30.390
like New Mexico and all the New Mexico stories will come up,
but it's not,

769
00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:33.870
it's not perfectly there yet.
Uh,
but we,

770
00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:38.960
the story map is my answer for all that because then you can search for anything

771
00:46:39.121 --> 00:46:40.380
and it's you,
it's right there.

772
00:46:40.381 --> 00:46:44.490
You see like this globe and it pulls up all those stories and you can zoom in

773
00:46:44.491 --> 00:46:45.930
and see it's,
it's really cool,

774
00:46:45.931 --> 00:46:49.290
but we have to get it to a place where we can publish it and it's not quite

775
00:46:49.291 --> 00:46:53.820
there yet.
Uh,
and additionally,
the,
what was it like stories we want to create,

776
00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:58.530
uh,
a companion site that lives on,

777
00:46:58.531 --> 00:47:03.090
I'm from driftwood but feels like it's its own thing also.

778
00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:05.190
So that if you want to only look at what was it,
like stories,

779
00:47:05.191 --> 00:47:08.250
you can go there and all their stories are presented it in this way.

780
00:47:08.370 --> 00:47:11.370
Like a single,
like Pearl has six other stories.
So a wave,

781
00:47:11.371 --> 00:47:13.500
just watch that one story we just watched,

782
00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:16.800
but know that there are other stories from Pearl right there that you can just

783
00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:20.460
click on next.
Uh,
so yes,
we,
uh,

784
00:47:20.610 --> 00:47:25.290
we need help with website development and that story map.
So reach out.

785
00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:27.810
Yeah.
Did I answer your question?
Okay,
great.

786
00:47:30.330 --> 00:47:32.840
<v 1>Um,
I also want to know that the,
um,</v>

787
00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:37.960
Googlers to are either watching this video or here in the room,
uh,

788
00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:40.760
can in their own personal capacity outside of work,

789
00:47:40.761 --> 00:47:44.390
certainly offer their stories to I'm with drift away,

790
00:47:44.391 --> 00:47:48.740
then we're happy to help connect,
uh,
you know,

791
00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:52.640
you as volunteers and with Nathan in order to get those stories up,

792
00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:54.620
if that would be something that would be of interest.

793
00:47:55.550 --> 00:47:58.640
Does anyone else have any questions for Nathan while we're here?

794
00:48:00.890 --> 00:48:04.310
Yeah,
Raheem Vito,
mind just popping up to the mic so we can capture you.

795
00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:09.780
<v 8>He needs an,
my name's a quick question.
So you said,
so you,
um,</v>

796
00:48:09.890 --> 00:48:14.450
wholesome times onsite events of to help with the cause was,

797
00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:17.790
and also how did you,
how do you decide like what type of help,

798
00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:19.720
like build community,
you know,

799
00:48:19.721 --> 00:48:22.960
where did you go for those resources or do you just kind of develop that

800
00:48:22.961 --> 00:48:24.430
yourself or,

801
00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:28.640
<v 9>yeah,
we basically just,
um,
kind of kick.</v>

802
00:48:28.641 --> 00:48:31.580
We knew that we wanted to take it offline.
And we,
you know,

803
00:48:31.581 --> 00:48:36.140
we've been operating for nine years and we know that we have a lot of supporters

804
00:48:36.141 --> 00:48:41.000
and fans,
uh,
because whenever we have fundraisers,
people show up.
So,

805
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:44.570
but that eliminates a lot of the rest of the community who,

806
00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:48.980
who likes I'm from just would,
if you have to pay $100 to go to,
uh,
a fundraiser.

807
00:48:48.981 --> 00:48:53.850
So we wanted a,
an option for anyone to participate,
uh,

808
00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:56.570
in come in and be part of the iron from trips with community.

809
00:48:56.750 --> 00:49:01.730
So all of our community events are free and typically they're at a,

810
00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:06.820
they're like happy hour times at bars and more generally a community spaces.

811
00:49:07.790 --> 00:49:12.740
Um,
and so that we,
uh,
and later in March,
we have a,

812
00:49:12.830 --> 00:49:15.710
our anniversary party at stonewall upstairs,
uh,

813
00:49:15.711 --> 00:49:19.790
in April we have a storyteller spotlight at club coming.
So,
uh,
you know,

814
00:49:19.791 --> 00:49:21.910
we're trying to have,
you know,

815
00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:26.090
target different age groups and different people in the community just by having

816
00:49:26.750 --> 00:49:30.620
fun events.
And really it was,
it was,
uh,
it also,

817
00:49:30.621 --> 00:49:33.970
we have like just last week I spoke at Cuny here in New York and they have an

818
00:49:33.971 --> 00:49:35.390
LGBT student group,

819
00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:39.050
so some are college campuses,

820
00:49:39.051 --> 00:49:42.000
some are like at bars and community centers.
Uh,

821
00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:45.800
we had an event at the center several years ago.
So yeah.
So really the,

822
00:49:45.801 --> 00:49:48.860
the objective was to take it offline and get all these people who know about I'm

823
00:49:48.861 --> 00:49:51.890
from driftwood if they gather in a room as opposed to just commentate on

824
00:49:51.891 --> 00:49:52.850
Facebook or whatever.

825
00:49:53.730 --> 00:49:57.810
<v 8>Okay.
Yeah,
I see.
You're saying Leslie,
so how do you keep them coming back?</v>

826
00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:00.573
<v 7>MMM,</v>

827
00:50:02.190 --> 00:50:07.100
<v 9>it depends on what it like people to go to the events,
um,</v>

828
00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:13.050
our newsletter and good like,
you know,
drink specials at the bars and you know,

829
00:50:13.051 --> 00:50:16.590
but really we had an event,
the last one that we had,
um,
featured,

830
00:50:16.591 --> 00:50:19.320
his name was Robert Richards and he just had,
it was a,

831
00:50:19.321 --> 00:50:20.400
what was it like storyteller?

832
00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:24.900
It was one of the most incredible experiences,

833
00:50:24.901 --> 00:50:26.700
like seeing him watch his stories.

834
00:50:26.701 --> 00:50:31.490
He had seen them and we published it over a year ago.
So we got to see him.

835
00:50:31.491 --> 00:50:35.510
Watch his own stories.
And at one point he was like,
he was like,
wait,
stop.

836
00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:39.590
It was about a former lover.
And uh,
he was like,
stop,
I can't,
I can't.

837
00:50:39.830 --> 00:50:42.590
And then the moderator asks him questions and he had talked about it and he's

838
00:50:42.591 --> 00:50:46.730
like,
okay,
okay,
I'm good.
Let's finish the video.
Finished it.
And he was like,

839
00:50:46.731 --> 00:50:50.990
that was just,
you just have this emotion and like raw emotion in the room.

840
00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:55.910
And I think that's what gets people really coming back.
They see the,
um,

841
00:50:56.210 --> 00:50:59.660
the emotions that come out from these stories and also seeing the story teller

842
00:50:59.661 --> 00:51:01.640
there.
So for the storyteller spotlights,

843
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:06.670
it's just this powerful experience to witness and to hear stories in an

844
00:51:07.791 --> 00:51:12.560
interview from our elders,
you know?
So,
uh,
so the,
my hope is that that people,

845
00:51:12.590 --> 00:51:15.620
the people who go to these experience,
that this,

846
00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:19.730
these feelings and come back for more.
So thank you.

847
00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:21.543
<v 3>Thanks Ray.</v>

848
00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:28.230
<v 1>Any other questions?
Anyone brave?</v>

849
00:51:28.540 --> 00:51:31.410
But I can see out there.
Um,
if not,

850
00:51:31.411 --> 00:51:33.930
then thank you so much for being here.

851
00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:36.570
We're so delighted to have,

852
00:51:36.571 --> 00:51:40.740
I'm from driftwood here at Google and to be able to hear about the process and

853
00:51:40.741 --> 00:51:43.470
the journey for you,
um,
and also how we can get involved.

854
00:51:43.471 --> 00:51:46.860
So we will definitely look forward to seeing you again,
but really appreciate it.

855
00:51:46.861 --> 00:51:48.230
Let's give him a round of applause.
Shall we

856
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.320
<v 3>thank you.
Yeah,
thanks.</v>

857
00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:59.760
<v 1>You wanna play the third video.
Okay.
We've got it might as well.</v>

858
00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:01.670
We've got it.
It's right here.

859
00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:09.450
<v 10>My name is Alexa SB now and I'm from New York City.</v>

860
00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:14.880
I recently came to Mississippi,
uh,
four months ago to teach.

861
00:52:14.970 --> 00:52:19.350
I'm teaching middle school art,
sweat,
teach six through seven.

862
00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:23.070
I'm six,
seventh and eighth grade.
It's been eight weeks now.

863
00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:26.790
And it was interesting being a young person,
right?

864
00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:31.680
Because I'm obviously very young and coming from New York City and then

865
00:52:31.681 --> 00:52:36.681
asserting this kind of power and being in this place where you are not really

866
00:52:37.381 --> 00:52:41.640
connected to the culture plus like I don't necessarily,
um,

867
00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:45.360
I am a colored person but don't racially identify with.

868
00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:50.460
They still don't know what I am and trying to,

869
00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:52.080
where were you in the state?

870
00:52:52.081 --> 00:52:57.081
It's kind of very black and white and the inbetween between is strange and for

871
00:52:58.411 --> 00:53:02.910
students is hard for them to gauge that.
So it's my second week of school,

872
00:53:02.911 --> 00:53:07.800
I'm still figuring out how to navigate this new realm that I'm in,

873
00:53:07.801 --> 00:53:10.600
right?
This new place,
um,

874
00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:15.620
new position and I have to walk all the students in a line to the bathroom.

875
00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:21.440
So there's some waiting time and as other students are using the bathroom is two

876
00:53:21.630 --> 00:53:25.020
kids.
These two students break out in a fight,
kind of,
not a fight,

877
00:53:25.050 --> 00:53:28.380
but just like a tiff between the two.
And they're like,
you're gay,
you're gay,

878
00:53:28.381 --> 00:53:31.170
you're gay.
And I was just like,

879
00:53:31.530 --> 00:53:36.530
how do I address this knowing that if I can get fired for being gay in

880
00:53:37.081 --> 00:53:40.530
Mississippi,
which is like a huge thing.
Um,

881
00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:45.960
and then on top of that,
knowing that there's like this like religious thing,

882
00:53:45.961 --> 00:53:50.010
how do I then say anything about it?
But I knew that had to say something,

883
00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:52.320
something needed to be said.
So I was like,

884
00:53:52.321 --> 00:53:55.620
we're not going to speak about being gay in a negative way cause it's not

885
00:53:55.621 --> 00:53:58.200
negative and we're not going to use that word in that kind of way.

886
00:53:58.290 --> 00:53:59.550
We're not going to use that language.

887
00:54:00.090 --> 00:54:04.830
And this one kid kind of straightened up,
looks forward and he's like,

888
00:54:04.831 --> 00:54:08.370
okay,
I'm not going to do.
And then this other kid,
this other student blurts out,

889
00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:12.750
well no,
it's a sin.
Being gay is a sin,
it's wrong.

890
00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:17.910
And I didn't know what to say at that point and

891
00:54:19.590 --> 00:54:23.040
I just knew that I couldn't push too much,
especially it's my second week.

892
00:54:23.041 --> 00:54:28.041
Like I'm not trying to cause like huge waves either and I was just kind of like,

893
00:54:28.830 --> 00:54:33.120
well we're not using that word in a negative way and kind of just shut it down

894
00:54:33.121 --> 00:54:34.890
there.
Um,

895
00:54:35.490 --> 00:54:38.610
so he just straightened up and we ended up going back to the classroom.

896
00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:43.170
Time passes on and I still hear it every now again the hallway.

897
00:54:43.590 --> 00:54:48.590
And the first time I saw maybe like a small light was this one kid decided to

898
00:54:49.621 --> 00:54:54.000
say it in my classroom.
The word comes up again.
And these two boys start saying,

899
00:54:54.001 --> 00:54:58.830
you're gay,
you're gay.
And all I did was give a look and this one student says,

900
00:54:59.130 --> 00:55:03.240
we're not using that type of language.
And I was like,
yeah,
that's amazing.

901
00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:08.100
And I'm planting a seed and it's,
it's something's happening,
right?
So there's a,

902
00:55:08.190 --> 00:55:11.310
there's going to be change and she's going to take some time.

903
00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:17.310
I think it's important to always respect where people come from and understand

904
00:55:17.311 --> 00:55:21.550
that everybody has a different background,
has different beliefs.
Um,

905
00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:25.980
and so the only way to really create any type of change is to meet them where

906
00:55:25.981 --> 00:55:27.240
they,
where they are,

907
00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:32.750
meet them with what they know and try to not change the way that they think,

908
00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:34.650
but maybe change the framing of what they've seen,

909
00:55:34.651 --> 00:55:38.790
especially when you're dealing with young students.
Right?
Um,

910
00:55:39.690 --> 00:55:44.490
so by not reprimanding him in a kind of way of saying like,
you're wrong,

911
00:55:44.730 --> 00:55:48.060
just saying that's just not the,
that's not the word to use.

912
00:55:48.061 --> 00:55:51.690
We're not using that word in a negative way.
And that word isn't negative.

913
00:55:52.110 --> 00:55:54.240
And hopefully students will feel a lot more comfortable.

914
00:55:54.241 --> 00:55:57.090
Any students that are maybe struggling with sexual identity,

915
00:55:57.091 --> 00:56:00.810
that they can see that they can come to me.
I'm an ally.
I'm someone that

916
00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:01.693
<v 3>they can speak to.</v>

917
00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:12.860
That was a nice way to end.
Thanks everyone.
