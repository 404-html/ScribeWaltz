Hi everyone.
Welcome to talks at Google.
Today we have Amanda Bradford,

2
00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.600
the founder and CEO of dating APP.
The league.

3
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.450
The league is a dating app that combines data and social graphs from both

4
00:00:19.451 --> 00:00:24.451
Facebook and Linkedin to offer privacy from coworkers more context about a

5
00:00:24.911 --> 00:00:29.800
potential match and a curated community of ambitious singles who desire an

6
00:00:29.801 --> 00:00:31.090
equally driven partner.

7
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.550
Amanda have previously worked in technical roles at both salesforce and Google

8
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.730
and holds an Mba from Stanford University and a BS in information systems from

9
00:00:41.921 --> 00:00:46.000
Carnegie Mellon.
It's a great pleasure for us to have Amanda here with us today.

10
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.290
Thanks guys.
[inaudible]

11
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:51.910
so to get started,

12
00:00:51.911 --> 00:00:55.900
maybe you could tell us a little bit about how you came up with the idea for the

13
00:00:55.901 --> 00:00:59.020
league because it definitely has a unique spin on the dating app.

14
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.030
<v 2>Yeah,
we definitely,
I took a lot of,
uh,
uh,
drew from my own experiences,</v>

15
00:01:03.031 --> 00:01:04.950
I like to say.
So,
um,

16
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.940
I kind of followed your classic design a product that you want to use and don't

17
00:01:08.941 --> 00:01:12.750
really listen to other people and then then kind of figure it out once you,

18
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.010
once you launch it.
So I,
I,
um,
I was at Stanford Business School,

19
00:01:17.011 --> 00:01:19.480
which is obviously a very selective community,

20
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.750
is a pretty intense admissions process.

21
00:01:21.751 --> 00:01:25.020
I think I planned for about two years on like how I was going to get into

22
00:01:25.021 --> 00:01:28.560
Stanford and all the things I needed to do.
And so you could argue like,
you know,

23
00:01:28.561 --> 00:01:32.490
the longer prep time you have to,
you know,
the better your application is for,

24
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.361
for business school.

25
00:01:33.361 --> 00:01:36.950
And so I think part of what inspired me around this kind of using,

26
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.070
taking out model and overlaying it onto the dating communities as is a how

27
00:01:41.071 --> 00:01:43.710
effective,
um,
it was in matching people.

28
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.480
I think Peter can talk to this to our class.

29
00:01:45.481 --> 00:01:48.630
I think we had like 20 or 30 couples I just like formed in the first month.

30
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.310
And you're kind of like,
what,

31
00:01:50.311 --> 00:01:54.720
what is it about this community that that kind of creates a way that people can

32
00:01:54.721 --> 00:01:56.070
kind of feel connected faster.

33
00:01:56.071 --> 00:01:59.040
And I think it is because people did put their best effort into their profile.

34
00:01:59.041 --> 00:02:01.320
They worked really hard.
They made sure their,
you know,
their photos are good.

35
00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:03.840
They put their application in and they waited.

36
00:02:03.841 --> 00:02:06.300
And then when they join the community there,
they're there for the right reasons.

37
00:02:06.301 --> 00:02:08.550
And they have the right kind of the right,
you know,

38
00:02:08.551 --> 00:02:11.190
they're going into their class and they're taking notes and it's sort of like

39
00:02:11.191 --> 00:02:13.560
they're good students,
right?
Cause you put all this time into it.

40
00:02:13.561 --> 00:02:15.870
And so I think that's sort of the concept I want to take into dating.

41
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.590
Cause I think dating suffers from people like having a lack of the kind of

42
00:02:19.591 --> 00:02:24.591
intent or motivation to to have like a really core kind of relationship seeking

43
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.760
experience.
Right?
There's a lot of these casual apps.

44
00:02:26.761 --> 00:02:28.140
And so I wanted to kind of turn,

45
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.740
take what I learned at business school and how Stanford does such a good job of

46
00:02:31.741 --> 00:02:34.140
kind of creating this diverse but but you know,

47
00:02:34.141 --> 00:02:36.570
very interconnected community and how to,

48
00:02:36.571 --> 00:02:38.700
can I kind of scale that into the digital?

49
00:02:38.701 --> 00:02:41.370
How can I create like a digital version of a business school?

50
00:02:41.371 --> 00:02:44.250
And so I think that was sort of the like kind of high level vision.

51
00:02:44.251 --> 00:02:47.160
And then of course it gets down into the nuts and bolts of execution,
right,

52
00:02:47.161 --> 00:02:50.580
which is not,
you can't always execute things the right way,

53
00:02:50.581 --> 00:02:52.730
the perfect way on v one.
So I think we're,

54
00:02:52.731 --> 00:02:55.080
we're kind of working towards that but,
but yeah,

55
00:02:55.081 --> 00:02:58.140
so that was I guess the impetus of,
you know me,
I was single,

56
00:02:58.141 --> 00:02:59.710
I was in business school and I was like,

57
00:02:59.711 --> 00:03:04.180
I want this app because I want to save myself time and bad dates and terrible

58
00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:08.470
conversations.
So I was optimizing and kind of for myself,

59
00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:11.260
I guess it selfishly,
and then I was writing,

60
00:03:11.261 --> 00:03:14.680
I found myself writing support feature requests into like hinge and coffee meets

61
00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:15.910
Bagel and tender.

62
00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:18.400
And I was really literally writing them like what I thought they should do.

63
00:03:18.401 --> 00:03:21.580
And then I remember I googled all the founders and I was like looking at their

64
00:03:21.581 --> 00:03:24.220
background.
I'm like,
wait a minute,
I'm more technical than all of these guys.

65
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.160
And I was like,
man,
I like worked at a tech company.

66
00:03:27.161 --> 00:03:29.230
These guys like had come from finance and stuff.
I was like,

67
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.270
why am I writing them feature requests?
Like,

68
00:03:31.271 --> 00:03:32.920
I was like writing specs for them and I was like,

69
00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:35.080
I'm just going to go and build this myself.

70
00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:39.880
So I kind of talked to myself and to like go in and starting this project

71
00:03:39.881 --> 00:03:41.860
instead of kind of complaining about,
you know,

72
00:03:41.861 --> 00:03:45.370
how much dating apps suck all the time.
Which I was.
Yeah.
That's awesome.

73
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.860
<v 0>So what would you say is the one differentiating feature from the league that</v>

74
00:03:49.861 --> 00:03:52.230
sets it apart from other dating apps out there?

75
00:03:52.231 --> 00:03:55.050
What would you say to someone who's maybe Tinder or bumble?

76
00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:56.940
<v 2>I mean I always say like our three,</v>

77
00:03:56.941 --> 00:04:00.600
like I always think our three core pillars or value proposition is one.

78
00:04:00.601 --> 00:04:03.570
We just give you much more context about a user.
So we have your linkedin,

79
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.810
we're pulling your linkedin data and your Facebook data and your kind of league

80
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.700
data that you give us.
So you just,

81
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.230
you just know more information about the person,

82
00:04:10.231 --> 00:04:15.030
like step one and then step two because we pull that social graph from work and

83
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.750
uh,
your social life.

84
00:04:16.751 --> 00:04:20.070
So your Facebook friends we actually block you from those I think are awkward

85
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.790
and unnecessary interactions to be like matched with your colleague on a dating

86
00:04:23.791 --> 00:04:25.440
app when you're working on a project with them.
That's just like,

87
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.100
I think unnecessary thing and we don't need to do that anymore because we have

88
00:04:29.101 --> 00:04:30.900
the social graphs at our disposal.

89
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.680
So I think setting up that privacy so people feel like it's a very safe place

90
00:04:34.681 --> 00:04:38.460
that they can be single and they don't have to worry about kind of bleeding into

91
00:04:38.461 --> 00:04:40.710
work.
Um,
and then the last piece is that community aspect.

92
00:04:40.711 --> 00:04:45.120
I think having a community where people are,
you know,
whether or not they are,

93
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.900
that they are self selecting into a community that is for an eagle attarian

94
00:04:48.901 --> 00:04:49.650
relationship.

95
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.150
They are kind of stating somewhat that they're open to like a pretty,
you know,

96
00:04:54.151 --> 00:04:56.760
a power couple relationship or a relationship where both parties are equal.

97
00:04:56.761 --> 00:05:00.420
And so I think creating a community where that is the ethos and the values and

98
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.400
maybe not everyone upholds them all the time,

99
00:05:02.401 --> 00:05:05.640
but if that's kind of part of the table stakes even get in.

100
00:05:05.641 --> 00:05:09.420
So I think that that's sort of how you create a really good value system and

101
00:05:09.421 --> 00:05:13.630
community.
Uh,
like a Google,
you know,
Google has a great,
uh,
internal community.

102
00:05:13.631 --> 00:05:14.520
So I always kind of think he's like,

103
00:05:14.521 --> 00:05:16.770
I want to create where like all the people that use the league,

104
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.150
it feels like a bunch of Googlers,
right?

105
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.260
And they're all debating around how we should kind of,
um,
you know,

106
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.800
dictate the community or what rules we should put in place when governance.

107
00:05:25.801 --> 00:05:27.840
And I want the community to be involved in those decisions.

108
00:05:27.841 --> 00:05:30.090
I don't want to be like a big brother where we're like,

109
00:05:30.091 --> 00:05:32.730
here's what you need to do and you get kicked out if you do this.
I want the,

110
00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.590
I want it to be kind of a democracy.
So we're,

111
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.620
we're kind of focusing on like how do we build this social aspect of the

112
00:05:37.621 --> 00:05:40.890
community so that our users can help us with some of these harder decisions

113
00:05:40.891 --> 00:05:44.280
about when do we kicked someone out?
Or when do we let,
is that profile,
you know,

114
00:05:44.281 --> 00:05:46.560
is that league,
where are they and what are we calling league where the,

115
00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.370
and as we kind of talk about a lot of these existential questions,
um,
you know,

116
00:05:50.371 --> 00:05:53.160
we want our users to kind of feel involved as if it's their,
you know,

117
00:05:53.161 --> 00:05:55.310
their community that they're getting it to have a voice in.

118
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.570
<v 0>Is the definition of what you consider it to be the worthy,</v>

119
00:05:59.571 --> 00:06:00.980
has that changed over time?

120
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:02.811
<v 2>Yeah,
I like that word.</v>

121
00:06:02.811 --> 00:06:06.720
We came up with that word because I think it's like purposefully ambiguous.
Um,

122
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.240
but I think,
you know,
I think what we've seen is,
yeah,
it definitely has changed,

123
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.670
but definitely by region.
So,
you know,

124
00:06:13.671 --> 00:06:18.620
you go from New York where almost half your users are in finance or tech or

125
00:06:18.621 --> 00:06:22.370
media basically.
And then you go to somewhere like we just launched Houston.
Um,

126
00:06:22.371 --> 00:06:25.190
oil and gas is like the number one industry there.
So really understanding,

127
00:06:25.191 --> 00:06:29.450
like we had a whole table of kind of classifications on programs,
um,

128
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.210
schools and like different jobs.
Like,
for instance,

129
00:06:32.211 --> 00:06:35.690
Comcast in Philadelphia is like,
you know the Google,
they're like that's a very,

130
00:06:35.691 --> 00:06:35.901
you know,

131
00:06:35.901 --> 00:06:40.901
so we had to kind of re rank and re calibrate a lot of how we thought about sort

132
00:06:41.391 --> 00:06:44.480
of you know,
selection and,
and what we were using as our proxy.

133
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.400
Cause if you think about it,
where are you just using a bunch of,

134
00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.960
we're copying the Google playbook,

135
00:06:47.961 --> 00:06:52.310
which is use GPA as a proxy for intelligence and don't let people,
you know,

136
00:06:52.311 --> 00:06:54.380
I remember when I first started Google,
like half of my friends,

137
00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:58.640
like I don't have a three,
seven,
five GPA so I can't apply.
And you know,

138
00:06:58.641 --> 00:07:01.940
the Google,
his line was always like,
we know that GPA is a stupid,

139
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:05.030
is a stupid indicator,
but it's a proxy and it's not a bad one.

140
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.220
And I remember we did the case study on that.
I was like that.

141
00:07:07.221 --> 00:07:09.980
I think that's what we do.
That's what we do with kind of education and,

142
00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:11.121
and profession.

143
00:07:11.121 --> 00:07:14.390
It's like we know it's not perfect and there's definitely a lot of other things

144
00:07:14.391 --> 00:07:16.640
and factors to evaluate,
but it's a proxy and it,

145
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:19.190
it does a pretty good like 80% of the job.

146
00:07:19.191 --> 00:07:20.810
And then I think that's where the kind of fun,

147
00:07:20.811 --> 00:07:22.730
exciting part is where you get the,
the humans involved in,

148
00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.770
we can kind of build a perfect solution of next to it.
Yeah.

149
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.290
<v 0>What are some of the factors that you take into account for determining whether</v>

150
00:07:30.291 --> 00:07:32.420
someone should get approved or not?
Besides GPA?

151
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:36.570
<v 2>Well we don't ask GPA but we do,
we have their linkedin profile so you can see,</v>

152
00:07:36.571 --> 00:07:38.880
you know,
what institutions they've attended and you can see what,

153
00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:40.320
what jobs they've held with titles.

154
00:07:40.321 --> 00:07:43.080
They've had their progression of their titles.
You can kind of see,

155
00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:46.980
you get a decent indication of if someone is relatively ambitious from their

156
00:07:46.981 --> 00:07:47.880
linkedin profile.

157
00:07:47.881 --> 00:07:51.390
So I think that that's sort of one thing we look for is just sort of that,

158
00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:52.740
you know,
I kind of think of the league,

159
00:07:52.741 --> 00:07:56.400
it is a little bit of a workaholic community.
Like everyone in it is,
you know,

160
00:07:56.401 --> 00:08:00.030
they're working work is one of their passions and that is a shared value that is

161
00:08:00.031 --> 00:08:01.990
shared across the community.
So I think,
um,

162
00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.960
you asked any one of your questions was about like,
you know,

163
00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:05.250
screen based on values,

164
00:08:05.251 --> 00:08:08.400
but I actually would argue that like the people who join the league value

165
00:08:08.401 --> 00:08:12.380
education and they also value ambition and they value people going after in

166
00:08:12.381 --> 00:08:14.760
accomplishing things.
And so I think to me like we've,

167
00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:19.050
we've kind of created one of the few value based dating communities rather than

168
00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.770
kind of the,
the Walmarts of the world where they're just sort of,
you know,

169
00:08:22.771 --> 00:08:26.670
people.
So I think we've kind of tried to embed the values into,
into our brand.

170
00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:31.710
<v 0>And then one of the other things that you mentioned is that your experience in</v>

171
00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.440
large tech companies and sort of what made you realize,
hey,

172
00:08:34.441 --> 00:08:37.320
if all these other people who didn't have technical background could do it,

173
00:08:37.321 --> 00:08:38.960
then I can also do it.
So mean,

174
00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:42.870
can you share a little bit about how you drew on your experiences and the skills

175
00:08:42.871 --> 00:08:45.090
you developed while working at salesforce?

176
00:08:45.091 --> 00:08:47.190
And Google to help you when you started your company?

177
00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:52.060
<v 2>Yeah,
I mean I think the three key skills I learned were sales.
Um,
you know,</v>

178
00:08:52.061 --> 00:08:53.290
starting a company is like,

179
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:57.120
I would say the first two years it's like 90 sales and then the second two years

180
00:08:57.121 --> 00:09:00.990
I feel like maybe 70% sales.
But it's for the most part you're,

181
00:09:00.991 --> 00:09:04.020
you're moving into a sales role essentially when you start a company.

182
00:09:04.021 --> 00:09:07.460
So I think having a quota,
having learned how to sell,
have you learned how to,

183
00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:10.850
you know,
what it feels like to miss your quota,
what it feels like to,
to,

184
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:15.000
to do really well and go to club and kind of understand like how kind of,
uh,

185
00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:18.780
the sales mentality works I think is super helpful because when you start,

186
00:09:18.781 --> 00:09:21.150
you're coming,
you're pitching investors are pitching,
employees are pitching,

187
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:24.300
senior leaders are bridging partners.
So you're always pitching,

188
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:26.820
you're pitching people to join your app and say this is where you're going to

189
00:09:26.821 --> 00:09:29.970
meet your,
you know,
your significant other.
So I'm,
you know,
I'm pitching users.

190
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.720
So I think that having that sales experience was super helpful.

191
00:09:33.721 --> 00:09:35.190
And I think it allows you to,

192
00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:38.310
to kind of learn how to be confident even if you're not.

193
00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:42.210
So I think when I was at double click I had to sell,
um,
what else?
Google.

194
00:09:42.211 --> 00:09:43.530
But I was selling DoubleClick for publishers,

195
00:09:43.531 --> 00:09:47.730
which if any of you guys know is a very complex product and has a lot of legacy,

196
00:09:47.731 --> 00:09:49.740
there is actually two products happening when I was selling it.

197
00:09:49.741 --> 00:09:53.730
So I was selling x FP and DFP depending on what use case the,

198
00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:57.030
the publisher needed.
And it was a little,
a lot of hand waving.

199
00:09:57.031 --> 00:10:00.140
But I think that helped me learn like that's a very complex system.

200
00:10:00.141 --> 00:10:02.430
So you had to learn it inside and out and then be able to answer all the

201
00:10:02.431 --> 00:10:05.990
questions about it and then also be able to pitch it in a way that,
you know,

202
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:09.060
made the development team remember your buyer was signed,

203
00:10:09.061 --> 00:10:13.530
the check to actually implement the products.
So I think a Google and you know,

204
00:10:13.531 --> 00:10:15.390
especially at,
especially at Google,

205
00:10:15.391 --> 00:10:18.690
I got very deep into the kind of technical understanding of how the algorithms

206
00:10:18.691 --> 00:10:21.060
work,
the per forecasting.
So I think getting,

207
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.700
getting into the weeds and getting experience,
like really,

208
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:26.190
I remember reading a Spec at Google that I was like,

209
00:10:26.191 --> 00:10:29.820
this is so over my head because it was about kind of all the like math equations

210
00:10:29.821 --> 00:10:31.950
that go into the actual forecasting of the,

211
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:36.390
of the ads have if they were gonna run out of ad ad inventory.
So it's a pretty,

212
00:10:36.391 --> 00:10:38.940
you know,
it's very complex system.
But I think getting experience,
getting,

213
00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:42.240
getting super deep and technical,
even if you're not the technical person,

214
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:45.210
but being able to wrap your head around it because I think that allowed me to

215
00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:48.000
have the product management skills that I could kind of go and design these

216
00:10:48.001 --> 00:10:52.340
really complex systems and manage people implementing them and not kind of get a

217
00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:53.550
get over my head I guess.

218
00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:57.760
So I think learning how to kind of digest large pieces of information and

219
00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.360
understand it and be able to explain it back to people.

220
00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:04.590
Well we didn't say what's the hardest part of the process of starting the

221
00:11:04.591 --> 00:11:04.981
company?

222
00:11:04.981 --> 00:11:08.370
Was there anything that maybe was harder than you expected before you went into

223
00:11:08.371 --> 00:11:13.080
it?
Yeah.
Oh,
everything.
Yeah,
everything across the board.

224
00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:16.980
Um,
I think for me,
I waited a long time.

225
00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:19.950
I wanted to really make sure that the zero s like when did you want to start a

226
00:11:19.951 --> 00:11:21.480
company?
I was like,
I was just building an APP,

227
00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:24.930
build an APP that I wanted to use and then I wanted to see if it,

228
00:11:24.931 --> 00:11:26.940
if there was a potential to be a company.
Right.

229
00:11:26.941 --> 00:11:29.340
Did we have a business model where people are going to spend money?

230
00:11:29.341 --> 00:11:32.520
I didn't know that for a while.
Even before we monetize,

231
00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:36.660
we didn't know if we just had like a nice little lifestyle,
you know,
dating app,

232
00:11:36.661 --> 00:11:38.460
which you may,
who knows what's going to happen,

233
00:11:38.461 --> 00:11:40.050
but we didn't know if people are going to spend money.
Right.

234
00:11:40.051 --> 00:11:40.920
So we don't know what,

235
00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:43.830
you kind of don't know the value of your asset until you monetize.

236
00:11:43.831 --> 00:11:46.470
So I think that was something I wish we had done a little bit earlier.

237
00:11:46.471 --> 00:11:50.730
I think I would have taken less diluted of funding and things like that because

238
00:11:50.731 --> 00:11:54.730
we would have realized that our users do want okay pain and do have the,

239
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:57.340
have the kind of income to pay.
So we,

240
00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:01.750
we sort of kind of delayed our experimentation on monetization a little bit
late.

241
00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:04.840
So I think that that was something that I think would have made it easier

242
00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:06.550
because we would have known that,
okay,

243
00:12:06.551 --> 00:12:10.780
we can expect this amount of money coming in so we don't need to be running as

244
00:12:10.781 --> 00:12:12.310
fast or as stressed out.

245
00:12:12.311 --> 00:12:15.250
But we kind of all thought we were running out of money for like the second
year.

246
00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:18.970
So we were just like,
oh my gosh,
let's,
you know,
working a hundred hour weeks.

247
00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:22.630
So I think,
I think my other takeaway was just hiring a little bit earlier.

248
00:12:22.631 --> 00:12:24.430
Like I waited a very long time because I wanted,

249
00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:26.380
before I recruited amazing people,

250
00:12:26.381 --> 00:12:30.130
like you guys from your amazing jobs at places like Google.

251
00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.240
I wanted to make sure that I had a real kind of compelling pitch to,
to,

252
00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:35.520
to convince someone to join my team that,
you know,

253
00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:37.150
we're not going to go under in a year.
We're not going to,

254
00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.940
I'm going to be able to pay you market rate,
I'm going to be able to give you.

255
00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:44.050
So I wanted to kind of be able to be in that position to hire really amazing

256
00:12:44.051 --> 00:12:46.540
people.
But because of that,
we're just now kind of getting there.

257
00:12:46.541 --> 00:12:50.290
So for three years I basically was running kind of all the departments pretty,

258
00:12:50.291 --> 00:12:54.190
pretty poorly.
I would say,
you know how to be a B,
B minus level.
So you know,

259
00:12:54.191 --> 00:12:57.460
I was doing marketing,
I'm doing design,
I was doing like the ad creative.

260
00:12:57.461 --> 00:12:58.294
So it was like,

261
00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:01.210
I think that was the hardest part is just like having been kind of a one man

262
00:13:01.211 --> 00:13:03.400
show for for too long.
Yeah.

263
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:08.040
<v 0>So out of all those functions that you took on,
which was your favorite,</v>

264
00:13:08.041 --> 00:13:09.240
is there anything that you enjoyed?

265
00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:12.710
<v 2>Um,
I love,
I realized this,
I'm a,
I love copywriting,</v>

266
00:13:12.711 --> 00:13:17.510
so like my future dream job is that I get to just you like the fun copyrighting

267
00:13:17.511 --> 00:13:21.050
for the league and everybody else can do all the other work.
But,
um,
so yeah,

268
00:13:21.051 --> 00:13:24.700
I think,
I think you learn a lot because you're,
you kind of think of it as a,

269
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:27.560
you're all over the,
if you think of the company has like a stack,
right?

270
00:13:27.561 --> 00:13:31.370
You're kind of,
you're moving across the stack and you're doing email marketing,

271
00:13:31.371 --> 00:13:32.840
then you're doing Facebook ads,

272
00:13:32.841 --> 00:13:36.470
then you're figuring out how to set up HR and Zendesk and get the support team

273
00:13:36.471 --> 00:13:40.730
to,
you know,
integrated into slack so that people can open a Jira ticket.

274
00:13:40.731 --> 00:13:44.420
So it's like you're doing every job in the company,
right?
So I think you,

275
00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:48.040
in some ways it's awesome because you get to really know what your strengths and

276
00:13:48.041 --> 00:13:50.420
weaknesses are really,
obviously,
cause you're like,
Whoa,

277
00:13:50.421 --> 00:13:53.420
I'm actually really not good at design.
Like that was not a good logo.

278
00:13:53.421 --> 00:13:55.220
So I'm really glad we didn't go with that one,

279
00:13:55.221 --> 00:13:57.800
but I worked on the logo for probably like 40 hours.

280
00:13:57.801 --> 00:13:58.970
And then finally my friend was like,

281
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.900
I'm just taking this off your plate because yours are not good.
So I think like,

282
00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:05.700
but learning that,
right.
And so now I know that I need to,
you know,

283
00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.840
have a creative director that I always run stuff by and she has a really good

284
00:14:08.841 --> 00:14:11.060
eye for this.
I think you start to recognize,

285
00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:14.190
especially when you're young and you think you're good at everything and like I,

286
00:14:14.191 --> 00:14:17.480
I kind of learned what I wasn't good at and who I needed to hire.

287
00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:21.230
So I think in some ways it was helpful to kind of do everything because then I

288
00:14:21.231 --> 00:14:23.780
was like these things,
I'm really bad at like not very organized.

289
00:14:23.781 --> 00:14:25.370
So I'm actually not a great product manager.

290
00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:30.230
We just hired a a pm and he's really organized so he's going to compliment my

291
00:14:30.231 --> 00:14:34.370
like more sporadic style of [inaudible] mean I guess.

292
00:14:34.371 --> 00:14:35.980
So I think it's like kind of recognizing your,

293
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:38.870
your holes and trying to find people to compliment them.

294
00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:43.130
<v 0>What advice would you give to someone who's currently at a big company who's</v>

295
00:14:43.131 --> 00:14:46.580
maybe interested in starting a company or on the fence about it?

296
00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:49.300
<v 2>So I was you and I,</v>

297
00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:53.720
what I did is I did this like weekend or weeknight incubator when I was at

298
00:14:53.721 --> 00:14:57.140
Google.
Um,
and my boss was cool.
She let me leave early on like Thursdays.

299
00:14:57.141 --> 00:14:58.510
I think I had to take,
get down there.

300
00:14:58.511 --> 00:15:02.090
It was like one night a week and then I think the team could meet on the
weekend,

301
00:15:02.091 --> 00:15:05.120
but it was a good,
it was a good kind of jumping off point,

302
00:15:05.121 --> 00:15:08.330
like dipping your toe in the water of entrepreneurship because it was like a 12

303
00:15:08.331 --> 00:15:08.931
week program.

304
00:15:08.931 --> 00:15:12.840
The idea was at the end we kind of do a pitch night and you decide if you know

305
00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:16.010
anyone's ideas kind of have legs and people vote on them and then some of the

306
00:15:16.011 --> 00:15:19.270
teams stay together and work on it.
Some don't.
But I think,
you know,

307
00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:23.150
given that you guys are not at a,
uh,
a cloud,
like you're not in graduate school,

308
00:15:23.151 --> 00:15:24.470
like there's a lot of project courses there,

309
00:15:24.471 --> 00:15:28.160
but there are some that will be in San Francisco or mountain view that that can

310
00:15:28.161 --> 00:15:29.570
kind of serve that same purpose.

311
00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:32.130
And I think that was helpful to me because that was my first foray.

312
00:15:32.131 --> 00:15:33.770
I ended up realizing that I was like,
Oh,

313
00:15:33.771 --> 00:15:36.740
I'm actually don't have that many skills to bring to the table cause we were a

314
00:15:36.741 --> 00:15:41.300
group of four and I wasn't the one building the website and then I wasn't,
I was,

315
00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.800
I was said I was going to be the designer.

316
00:15:42.801 --> 00:15:46.100
And that was when I first started realizing that wasn't as good at design as as

317
00:15:46.101 --> 00:15:49.550
I thought it was.
Um,
but I think,
I think you learn,

318
00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:52.730
you kind of learned that how to go through the motions of a startup and kind of

319
00:15:52.731 --> 00:15:56.240
what the really annoying and like hard parts are going to be and what the fun

320
00:15:56.241 --> 00:15:57.074
parts are going to be.

321
00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:00.620
<v 0>And one of the ways that you can grow is as you mentioned by moving into new</v>

322
00:16:00.621 --> 00:16:01.880
markets,
new regions.

323
00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:06.890
So I read recently I think on Forbes that you guys are moving into Houston or

324
00:16:06.891 --> 00:16:08.510
have recently moved into Houston.

325
00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:12.170
So how did you decide that that was the right time to move into that market?

326
00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:16.000
<v 2>Well,
I mean you brought up a good point is how do you grow without reducing your</v>

327
00:16:16.001 --> 00:16:19.570
selectivity.
One way to do that is to,
to kind of move to different cities,
right?

328
00:16:19.571 --> 00:16:22.090
So you keep New York as,
you know what New York is,

329
00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:25.600
you keep them well and then you go and launch Houston and you're selective in

330
00:16:25.601 --> 00:16:30.070
Houston.
So that's one way to grow that we are working on now.

331
00:16:30.071 --> 00:16:33.310
So we've launched 20 cities this summer.
So that's like one,

332
00:16:33.311 --> 00:16:35.720
one growth channel is just city launches.

333
00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:39.340
Letting our users know where there once they use the APP share at a higher rate.

334
00:16:39.341 --> 00:16:43.330
So honestly opening cities is one of our like key growth strategies.

335
00:16:43.331 --> 00:16:47.530
And then I think the other one will be trying to understand how to kind of,

336
00:16:47.531 --> 00:16:49.720
how to grow virally within a specific community.

337
00:16:49.721 --> 00:16:53.830
So like within Houston we have like a ton of people from Deloitte.
We,

338
00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:55.960
I think we got the whole Houston Deloitte office or something.

339
00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:59.080
So it's like how do we even,
we don't have a ton of other signups in Houston,

340
00:16:59.081 --> 00:17:03.880
right?
So how do we kind of smartly and automatedly you know like go and say,

341
00:17:03.881 --> 00:17:05.470
okay you have a ton of Deloitte people,

342
00:17:05.471 --> 00:17:09.670
how do we maybe create a Deloitte promotion or some sort of leverage,

343
00:17:09.671 --> 00:17:12.250
that kind of core network you have to get the Accenture people.

344
00:17:12.251 --> 00:17:15.580
So I think we're kind of trying to now think a little bit more how do you take

345
00:17:15.581 --> 00:17:20.230
grassroots strategy and kind of automate it into your sort of launch strategy

346
00:17:20.231 --> 00:17:22.950
and your launch marketing.
So that's what we're kind of feeling

347
00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:27.620
<v 0>cause he know now you have any specific changes in terms of your overall product</v>

348
00:17:27.621 --> 00:17:31.550
vision or maybe some key features that you implemented that change the way

349
00:17:31.551 --> 00:17:34.730
people use the APP now compared to when you first started?

350
00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:35.681
<v 2>First and foremost,</v>

351
00:17:35.681 --> 00:17:39.670
we'll always be kind of just improving the core product value proposition,

352
00:17:39.671 --> 00:17:42.160
which is we are going to deliver you someone that you know,

353
00:17:42.161 --> 00:17:43.570
we think you'll be compatible with.

354
00:17:43.571 --> 00:17:48.280
But the stuff that I'm really excited about that isn't as revenue generating and

355
00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:49.320
kind of,

356
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:54.320
but I but we're excited about is we're creating a singles map anonymous.

357
00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:57.120
But this has been like my dream since I just,

358
00:17:57.121 --> 00:17:59.430
we just didn't have the development team to do it when we launched the league

359
00:17:59.431 --> 00:18:03.180
and it was a little bit of a side side feature.
But basically the idea is like,

360
00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:07.320
let's say your friend is recently out of relationship and it's Friday night and

361
00:18:07.321 --> 00:18:11.310
it's her,
you know,
you want to take her out,
rebound,
go out and like,
you know,

362
00:18:11.311 --> 00:18:14.100
drink and meet some nice single people.
So you're like,

363
00:18:14.101 --> 00:18:15.660
where do you go in San Francisco for?

364
00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:18.450
That's a very hard question and you're like,
there's nowhere to go,
right?

365
00:18:18.451 --> 00:18:22.800
Where are the single people?
So basically,
um,
what we want to do is get,

366
00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:26.190
is allow people to kind of refresh the map and then see where,
you know,

367
00:18:26.191 --> 00:18:29.310
if all the single people are at,
what is the one in mountain view of the big bar.

368
00:18:29.311 --> 00:18:32.750
You guys always go to Google bar sports.
Yeah.

369
00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:35.840
Everyone's at sports page wasn't.
Yeah.
Um,

370
00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:39.210
then you could see that on the map and be like maybe to their sports pages.

371
00:18:39.211 --> 00:18:43.560
A Good Friday night spot.
So I don't know.
We'll see.
We'll see how it,
how it goes.

372
00:18:43.561 --> 00:18:45.210
We're kind of MVP and it right now.
But I think,

373
00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.820
I think the idea is like how do we,
I want to increase the efficiency.

374
00:18:47.821 --> 00:18:49.170
I'm just like the whole problem,

375
00:18:49.171 --> 00:18:52.170
which is a single people don't know other people are single.
Right?

376
00:18:52.171 --> 00:18:54.210
So that's sort of why I love the slap bracelets.
So you always do,

377
00:18:54.211 --> 00:18:57.510
cause it's like when you were a glow in the dark slap bracelet,
you are single.

378
00:18:57.511 --> 00:19:01.110
So lets you know you're not going to have any of the kind of accidental,

379
00:19:01.111 --> 00:19:03.960
you're hitting on someone who has a boyfriend or a girlfriend or something like

380
00:19:03.961 --> 00:19:05.110
that.
So I just like,
I,

381
00:19:05.111 --> 00:19:09.090
I've personally want to like add more clarity and transparency and efficiency to

382
00:19:09.091 --> 00:19:12.780
the process and I think our users are smart enough to kind of figure a lot of

383
00:19:12.781 --> 00:19:13.231
stuff out.

384
00:19:13.231 --> 00:19:16.960
It's just like we're trying to remove the kind of the noise and the clutter and

385
00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:20.040
help them kind of get to the end goal faster.

386
00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:24.440
Which is meeting someone offline that you,
you know,
you fancy I guess.
Yeah.

387
00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:28.620
The map feature sort of reminds me of the new snapchat.
I know.

388
00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:32.130
Well I mean I'd actually,
I'm not a snapchat user cause I'm too old.

389
00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:36.300
I decided I was like Instagram,
I'm stopping at Instagram.
Um,

390
00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:39.420
but I just looked at the snapchat feature is very similar.

391
00:19:39.421 --> 00:19:41.640
We want to keep ours like anonymous of course.
So you're not like,

392
00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:45.480
that's really creepy to to be like that match didn't like me back.

393
00:19:45.481 --> 00:19:47.220
But he's over here.
You don't want,

394
00:19:47.221 --> 00:19:49.590
you don't want people to like go tab too much information.

395
00:19:49.591 --> 00:19:50.730
But I think just getting a,

396
00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:54.240
getting a high level understanding of like where you're kind of nightlife is

397
00:19:54.241 --> 00:19:57.030
going on in your city.
And then I think then we,
to me,

398
00:19:57.031 --> 00:20:02.031
this helps us move into more of a social networking like vibe and aspect.

399
00:20:02.071 --> 00:20:04.080
And then if you can have people who aren't single and single,

400
00:20:04.081 --> 00:20:06.630
just using the APP as like kind of a nightlife radar app,

401
00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:09.600
then I think it becomes a lot more interesting and we can start to think about

402
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:12.990
can we actually become a social network or are we always going to be a,
you know,

403
00:20:12.991 --> 00:20:15.310
a dating service.
Yeah.

404
00:20:15.311 --> 00:20:18.120
So I think in San Francisco's case there's single people out there,

405
00:20:18.121 --> 00:20:21.990
but a really hard part of the process is that everyone's so busy that all have

406
00:20:21.991 --> 00:20:25.980
soul cycle man schedules to meet up.
Yeah.

407
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:30.480
You can do to make the process of actually meeting all.
Exactly.

408
00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.240
And that's why we invested a lot in events.

409
00:20:33.241 --> 00:20:36.960
So we have actually another feature that we're coming out with is like a fully

410
00:20:36.961 --> 00:20:38.590
aggregated events feed.

411
00:20:38.591 --> 00:20:42.090
So right now we just kind of handpicked cool events in our cities that we think

412
00:20:42.091 --> 00:20:43.440
are on brand and cool.

413
00:20:43.441 --> 00:20:46.950
But instead I think as we think about kind of moving into more of a utility and

414
00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:50.930
trying to be a,
you know,
a social network that people actually depend on in use,

415
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.810
you know,
on a weekly basis,

416
00:20:52.811 --> 00:20:57.811
then we want to start getting into understanding kind of where the user is,

417
00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:00.210
why they're opening the APP at that time.
Right.
And what,

418
00:21:00.211 --> 00:21:02.950
what their kind of their use case is at that moment.

419
00:21:02.951 --> 00:21:05.770
So we don't want to get into like the Tinder,
like I'm looking for tonight,

420
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:09.310
where do I go tonight thing.
But I think of it as more of like events.

421
00:21:09.311 --> 00:21:12.880
Like if I can meet three of my matches by going to the tipsy pig on Friday night

422
00:21:12.881 --> 00:21:15.670
and I don't have to have a one and a half like awkward Starbucks,

423
00:21:15.671 --> 00:21:19.760
like interview meeting with three people,
um,
do you know,
during my work day,

424
00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:21.100
to me that's way more efficient.

425
00:21:21.101 --> 00:21:22.960
I got to kind of meet them in a more fun environment.

426
00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:24.670
Maybe I hit it off with some of them,
maybe I didn't.

427
00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.610
I got to talk to them for five or 10 minutes maybe.
I like all three of them,

428
00:21:27.611 --> 00:21:31.450
but I think to me like kind of moving group,
like what group we're used to do,

429
00:21:31.451 --> 00:21:34.600
which was a competitor that died,
but they set up three people in three,

430
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:38.890
three guys and three girls.
Um,
and people actually really liked that.

431
00:21:38.891 --> 00:21:41.800
Like I remember when I was doing user research,
like people liked the concept.

432
00:21:41.801 --> 00:21:44.560
There wasn't a lot of retention.
Is that a retention problem?

433
00:21:44.561 --> 00:21:45.760
No one did like a second group are,

434
00:21:45.761 --> 00:21:49.990
but there is something there I think with like taking away the kind of not

435
00:21:49.991 --> 00:21:52.870
requiring everyone to go to these one on one on one kind of interview style

436
00:21:52.871 --> 00:21:56.590
dates and if we can kind of change the format of dating and make it more group

437
00:21:56.591 --> 00:22:01.450
and fun and oriented around values or hobbies or yoga or people with dogs or you

438
00:22:01.451 --> 00:22:03.610
know,
whatever it might be,
I think that,
I think to me,

439
00:22:03.611 --> 00:22:07.090
I think that's like a much more efficient way to date and to meet new people.

440
00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:12.160
What would you say is one feature that the league offers?

441
00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:16.060
A lot of people don't know about that maybe you wished they knew?
Well,

442
00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:19.090
I guess I would say a lot of people know about this,

443
00:22:19.091 --> 00:22:20.320
but Google is hate this feature.

444
00:22:20.321 --> 00:22:23.350
So cause it basically blocks you from all your Googlers.

445
00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:28.370
We use linkedin well can basically,
it's like Google and Facebook has,

446
00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.630
but then everyone else is like thank you for not matching me with my coworker

447
00:22:31.631 --> 00:22:34.000
next to in the cube next to me.
But yeah,

448
00:22:34.001 --> 00:22:36.940
that I would say that feature is probably pretty hidden is just that when you
do,

449
00:22:36.941 --> 00:22:38.830
because we ask you to log in with your Linkedin,

450
00:22:38.831 --> 00:22:40.300
which people think is kind of weird.

451
00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.480
It actually allows us to then unblock you from anyone who works with you or

452
00:22:43.481 --> 00:22:44.350
anyone you're connected to.

453
00:22:44.351 --> 00:22:47.620
So I was in sales so I was always friending people on linkedin and I did a lot

454
00:22:47.621 --> 00:22:49.450
of like business development on linkedin.

455
00:22:49.451 --> 00:22:53.380
So like the last thing I wanted to do was see like one of the people I was kind

456
00:22:53.381 --> 00:22:57.790
of doing business deals with on my feed.
Like that's weird.
So I was like,

457
00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:00.640
let's just prevent that situation.
So I talked about that a little bit,

458
00:23:00.641 --> 00:23:04.360
but that one is hard to that one.
Not everyone knows about.

459
00:23:04.361 --> 00:23:07.570
And then I would say you can also sort,
so I had come from the CRM industry,

460
00:23:07.571 --> 00:23:11.140
right?
So when I look at the match screen of the League,
um,
everyone's like,

461
00:23:11.141 --> 00:23:12.940
it's very,
you know,
there's so much data there.
And I'm like,

462
00:23:12.941 --> 00:23:15.670
well if you're like as a CRM person,
like that's,

463
00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:19.630
you want to see all of the information kind of condensed and like an executive

464
00:23:19.631 --> 00:23:22.060
summary.
So if you look at our match screen,
um,

465
00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.730
I'm like the only one on the team that likes that screen,

466
00:23:24.731 --> 00:23:27.220
but I like it because it shows you all the information you need and you can

467
00:23:27.221 --> 00:23:32.100
actually sort your matches by least flaky,
most popular,
most recent,
and then,
uh,

468
00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:33.850
your best match.
And a lot of people don't know that,

469
00:23:33.851 --> 00:23:37.840
but we use the best match algorithm is actually pretty good and no one uses that

470
00:23:37.841 --> 00:23:40.960
either.
So those are the,
those are the under,
under marketed,

471
00:23:40.961 --> 00:23:44.080
I would call them under marketed features in the APP because we haven't done

472
00:23:44.081 --> 00:23:46.040
much to kind of tell the users about them.

473
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:51.310
<v 0>In terms of the elite sort of brand that yeah,</v>

474
00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:53.090
the,
the League has,

475
00:23:53.091 --> 00:23:58.091
do you think that that could potentially also lead to maybe like inadequate

476
00:23:59.151 --> 00:23:59.571
matches?

477
00:23:59.571 --> 00:24:03.500
Because I think that a lot of times people might find that they're really

478
00:24:03.501 --> 00:24:08.240
compatible with someone who doesn't necessarily come from the same like high

479
00:24:08.241 --> 00:24:11.170
level social class background that they do there.

480
00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:14.270
There's cross social class relationships.

481
00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:16.440
<v 2>Well statistically that's not true.</v>

482
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:19.320
I mean if you just look like if we're designing like I always like to say

483
00:24:19.321 --> 00:24:22.050
everything's a proxy and your v one is never going to be perfect,
right?

484
00:24:22.051 --> 00:24:24.840
So you have to just ignore some of the outline.
You use cases,

485
00:24:24.841 --> 00:24:28.380
it's like product management,
right?
So that's sort of the way that sort of,

486
00:24:28.381 --> 00:24:31.500
the way I think about is I looked at like statistically who is getting married

487
00:24:31.501 --> 00:24:33.270
to each other,
right?
So similar age,

488
00:24:33.271 --> 00:24:37.890
similar education level and actually similar industry is highly significant.

489
00:24:37.891 --> 00:24:39.450
So,
I mean,
you,

490
00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:43.320
I guess you can either try to like go with the data or go against the data,

491
00:24:43.321 --> 00:24:46.170
right?
But I think for,
for us,
if it's already happening in the real world,

492
00:24:46.171 --> 00:24:49.380
like we're just trying to create a software platform that facilitates that.

493
00:24:49.381 --> 00:24:51.660
We're not trying to sort of,
I mean,
eventually I've,
yeah,

494
00:24:51.661 --> 00:24:53.640
maybe I do want to change what people are doing in the real world.

495
00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:55.380
I think that's when you start to have influence.

496
00:24:55.381 --> 00:24:57.630
When you're a company like Google,
you can actually start to,

497
00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:00.990
to really make a change in society and how people are,

498
00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:03.330
are using and using software.

499
00:25:03.331 --> 00:25:06.960
But I think at our stage we just want to be able to get to that point and

500
00:25:06.961 --> 00:25:09.160
getting,
give our users what they need,
um,

501
00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:11.780
what they're kind of coming to our door for.
So,
I don't know,

502
00:25:11.781 --> 00:25:13.490
I guess I look at it as we're,

503
00:25:13.491 --> 00:25:18.300
we're kind of using math and data to give you kind of the best probability of

504
00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:19.590
someone you would match with.

505
00:25:19.591 --> 00:25:23.730
And we're not kind of trying to change the data set that we're using.

506
00:25:23.731 --> 00:25:26.580
We're trying to use the data set that people have researched for 20 or 30 years

507
00:25:26.581 --> 00:25:29.610
and apply it in like a smarter way.
So,
um,

508
00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:32.620
eventually I want to have my own research team and,
and kind of maybe,
you know,

509
00:25:32.621 --> 00:25:36.270
debunked some of this stuff or you know,
come up with find out how to,
you know,

510
00:25:36.271 --> 00:25:38.160
I think we always talk about that.
We want to,
you know,

511
00:25:38.161 --> 00:25:41.310
the creatives that never meet the finance people.
How do we,

512
00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:44.850
how do we make sure that they're both kind of coming into the community on equal

513
00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.040
amounts?
Um,
and,
and it's a challenge.

514
00:25:47.041 --> 00:25:50.490
Like we have way more finance people coming in to New York community,
then,

515
00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:53.130
you know,
creatives are people on Broadway and that's just,
that's,

516
00:25:53.131 --> 00:25:55.710
I think that's just a fact of like New York population,

517
00:25:55.711 --> 00:25:59.760
but the like a little bit of a fact of life and it is going to be harder for,

518
00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.980
you know,
that match to happen in the real world too.

519
00:26:01.981 --> 00:26:05.070
So it shouldn't it be kind of harder for it to happen on a dating APP.

520
00:26:05.071 --> 00:26:08.490
So we tried to think that we're kind of mimicking the real world and making it

521
00:26:08.491 --> 00:26:12.890
more efficient and useful and not trying to,

522
00:26:12.891 --> 00:26:15.510
to kind of tell people what,
you know,

523
00:26:15.511 --> 00:26:17.160
what they should or shouldn't be doing at this point.

524
00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:20.700
But we do kick people out if they're bad.
So we do,
we do,
we do tell people not,

525
00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:22.550
we do make sure people are respectful.
Um,

526
00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:25.110
so that's one thing we're pretty hard and hard and fast on.

527
00:26:25.111 --> 00:26:28.260
But as far as like what,
you know,
whether they're swiping or being super picky,

528
00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:29.670
I mean we give them advice,

529
00:26:29.671 --> 00:26:32.640
but if people want to be picky and say no to every single person,

530
00:26:32.641 --> 00:26:37.260
we give them for a whole year and then complain and you can't please everybody.

531
00:26:37.261 --> 00:26:39.360
As you guys know,
product managers,
it's like the,

532
00:26:39.361 --> 00:26:41.160
you always have that email that keeps you up at night.

533
00:26:41.161 --> 00:26:43.680
And from like we just had from a,

534
00:26:43.681 --> 00:26:46.590
it was actually a 72 year old lesbian woman who was very mad.
I mean,

535
00:26:46.591 --> 00:26:51.120
because we didn't have anyone to give her and you know,
we refunded her,
but I,

536
00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:54.620
I stay,
you know,
I like legit research.
And I was like,
what if we did,

537
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:57.180
I'm an advertising campaign to get.
And then I was like,

538
00:26:57.181 --> 00:26:59.880
this is not at the end of the day,
especially if you're running a company,

539
00:26:59.881 --> 00:27:01.980
you gotta,
you gotta cut that 20% off.

540
00:27:01.981 --> 00:27:05.310
I cannot be worrying about the 72 year old lesbian right now when we don't,

541
00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:09.430
we have 30 year olds maybe running out of matches that's way higher,
you know,

542
00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:10.620
more critical of a problem.

543
00:27:10.621 --> 00:27:14.790
So it's all kind of triage and I think a lot of the questions that go into like

544
00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:18.330
things we want to do when we,
when we have more people on staff are yes,

545
00:27:18.331 --> 00:27:21.800
like educating people on why you should be open minded and why you shouldn't

546
00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:24.780
reject people in their five,
nine instead of five,
10.
And you don't have a lot of,

547
00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:28.710
I have a lot of like blog posts saved up in me that I want to help people kind

548
00:27:28.711 --> 00:27:31.110
of to,
to optimize their dating life.

549
00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:33.390
But first we got to kind of get the product out

550
00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:34.980
<v 0>in terms of growth.
Uh,</v>

551
00:27:34.981 --> 00:27:39.160
another one of the opportunities can be expanding more into,
uh,

552
00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:42.600
the LGBT community.
So have you thought about ways to do that?
Right.

553
00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:44.270
<v 2>How we do,
we have a very good,</v>

554
00:27:44.271 --> 00:27:48.680
we have a great LGBT community in New York and actually a really good one in

555
00:27:48.681 --> 00:27:52.370
London.
Like it's like weirdly a disproportionate.
Um,

556
00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:56.240
but we haven't done any targeted marketing that's been all word of mouth
through,

557
00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:58.640
through that.
Um,
cause actually on Facebook you can't,

558
00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:01.870
you can only target straight people are like they make you have a,

559
00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:06.620
they make you change,
have a separate campaign for each one.
So we,
it's that,

560
00:28:06.621 --> 00:28:10.670
that's been a pretty,
pretty viral community for us.
So we,
yeah,
we want to,

561
00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:13.160
I think as we think about like where to spend in marketing,

562
00:28:13.161 --> 00:28:16.700
it's definitely getting investing in LGBT I think cause I,

563
00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:21.050
they also spent a lot too,
so it's like the,
I would say are,

564
00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:24.650
are LGBT and the New York finance,

565
00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:28.220
they both are kind of one of our better,
better customers.

566
00:28:28.221 --> 00:28:32.870
So we definitely want to learn how to kind of mark it to them and acquire them

567
00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:33.733
more.
Scalably

568
00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:39.860
<v 0>I want to go back a little bit to the filtering by education level and job.</v>

569
00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:44.250
Cause something that I was thinking about was that you're using this as a proxy

570
00:28:44.251 --> 00:28:48.240
for determining whether someone is driven right in some ways,
uh,

571
00:28:48.241 --> 00:28:51.450
but there's cases where people could be driven and really passionate about

572
00:28:51.451 --> 00:28:55.110
something but don't necessarily have the education level.
It doesn't come out.

573
00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:58.650
So like potentially like it could be an artist and you're really passionate

574
00:28:58.651 --> 00:29:00.060
about that are great artists.

575
00:29:00.061 --> 00:29:04.560
But in terms of education and job that might not be shown in your resume or you

576
00:29:04.561 --> 00:29:05.820
might all have a linkedin page.

577
00:29:05.821 --> 00:29:09.360
So have you thought about other things that you can use as proxies to get at

578
00:29:09.361 --> 00:29:10.350
that sentiment?

579
00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:14.190
<v 2>Yeah,
we talked a lot about that because linkedin is going to be calm right now.</v>

580
00:29:14.191 --> 00:29:17.790
Linkedin is fine and it's sort of serving as a natural curation mechanism for
us.

581
00:29:17.791 --> 00:29:19.950
Cause if you don't have a linkedin account,
like you know,

582
00:29:19.951 --> 00:29:21.240
you drop off at that point,
right?

583
00:29:21.241 --> 00:29:24.240
So we almost don't even have to deal with the people that don't have,

584
00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:27.770
have linkedin accounts.
But a lot of those are creatives.
And so we have net,

585
00:29:27.771 --> 00:29:28.740
when we launched la,

586
00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:31.500
we had a big problem because a lot of people in la don't use linkedin.

587
00:29:31.501 --> 00:29:35.250
It's like kind of not cool if like you're a cool person in the industry,

588
00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:36.600
you're not on linkedin really.

589
00:29:36.601 --> 00:29:41.040
So we ended up building a new flow so you could pay to skip it.

590
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.950
Then for an a la La when we launched into the kind of comping a lot of people to

591
00:29:44.951 --> 00:29:48.560
get through that kind of original linkedin screen.

592
00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:49.690
And I think as we think about international,

593
00:29:49.691 --> 00:29:53.530
that's going to be a huge issue for us too because not everyone internationally

594
00:29:53.531 --> 00:29:57.190
is kind of as linkedin focus.
It's very white collar,
right?
So as you get into,

595
00:29:57.550 --> 00:30:00.640
as you get into kind of the creative that producers,
they're not on,

596
00:30:00.641 --> 00:30:02.950
there might be on our CMDB,
they're on,

597
00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:06.340
so we talked about Amex like has all the API login.
So we're,

598
00:30:06.341 --> 00:30:09.290
we're kind of brainstorming with some different ways to,

599
00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:13.390
to kind of get start to get outside of our core linkedin,

600
00:30:13.391 --> 00:30:15.070
like white collar demographic.

601
00:30:15.071 --> 00:30:19.030
But I would say that linkedin does have a pretty big audience.
So I think for,

602
00:30:19.031 --> 00:30:19.930
you know,
short term,

603
00:30:19.931 --> 00:30:23.170
we want to at least just get at least the linkedin users in those cities that

604
00:30:23.171 --> 00:30:23.591
were live.

605
00:30:23.591 --> 00:30:26.950
And then like step two is let's get people that don't have linkedin accounts and

606
00:30:26.951 --> 00:30:28.030
figure out how to get them in.

607
00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:31.960
I think there's a lot of professional networks that are sort of more targeted.

608
00:30:31.961 --> 00:30:35.830
I think there's also one Doximity for Dr,
so we've talked to them.
Um,

609
00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:38.100
that's probably one will do next year.
Doximity.

610
00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:41.380
<v 3>Hi.
If you can talk about how you think about user retention,</v>

611
00:30:41.381 --> 00:30:43.750
because it seems like if people are really successful,

612
00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:46.770
then they may just turn off the platform very quickly.
Yeah.

613
00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:48.850
And then on the other hand,
if they really hate the experience,

614
00:30:48.851 --> 00:30:49.571
they'll turn off quickly,

615
00:30:49.571 --> 00:30:53.050
but there's like the sweet spot of people for maybe like a little bit frustrated

616
00:30:53.051 --> 00:30:53.320
somehow,

617
00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:56.080
but like enjoy the platform and we'll like it for a long time and spend money.

618
00:30:56.081 --> 00:30:57.490
So like how do you,
when people churn

619
00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:02.370
<v 2>good turn of turn.
Yeah.
Um,
yeah,
so we,
we have,</v>

620
00:31:02.371 --> 00:31:07.020
we call it good turn and Badger and we keep our names pretty simple here.
But,
um,

621
00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:09.810
yeah.
And uh,
we are,
we are excited about good Sharon.
I think,

622
00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:14.400
I think that worrying about good Sharon is like worrying about someone stealing

623
00:31:14.401 --> 00:31:17.190
your idea when you're an entrepreneur.
It's kind of like that,

624
00:31:17.191 --> 00:31:19.710
that means your product is doing the job that it was designed.
Did you,

625
00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:20.880
and Oh you,

626
00:31:20.881 --> 00:31:24.090
hopefully you can kind of be smart enough to build a business model around that

627
00:31:24.091 --> 00:31:27.960
to support that job that it's doing.
So we don't worry about vid churn.
Um,

628
00:31:27.961 --> 00:31:31.050
and I like to think that every good churn is like five new users in my head.

629
00:31:31.051 --> 00:31:33.890
I think of that because if they tell their friends or they tie it at the

630
00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:38.700
marriage ceremony or you know,
by the,
just how viral dating is in general,

631
00:31:38.701 --> 00:31:42.090
people tend to say where they met.
So I like,
I'm super,

632
00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:45.270
if everybody did good churn right away,
we'd be like,

633
00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:47.010
that'd be an amazing problem to have.
Um,

634
00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:50.700
bad churn is not good and bad churn typically happens when people don't get

635
00:31:50.701 --> 00:31:51.990
matches.
So they usually,

636
00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:54.900
and that is related to either pickiness or they're saying no to everyone there.

637
00:31:54.901 --> 00:31:59.880
I really just not happy with the selection or they're very low,
low performing,

638
00:31:59.881 --> 00:32:01.140
and everyone says no to them.
Right.

639
00:32:01.141 --> 00:32:04.470
So that's sort of the like two use cases or they're kind of been,

640
00:32:04.471 --> 00:32:07.500
there's a bunch of people in the middle of that kind of Sorta picky.
Not really,

641
00:32:07.501 --> 00:32:10.770
but also not really happy,
not getting a ton of mattress.
Do you have kind of the,

642
00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:11.671
so yeah,

643
00:32:11.671 --> 00:32:14.880
there's a lot of different kinds of experiences people can have on the APP and I

644
00:32:14.881 --> 00:32:18.180
think that's one of the hardest parts of the product management for it is that

645
00:32:18.181 --> 00:32:20.700
you kind of have,
I mean we don't really,

646
00:32:20.701 --> 00:32:22.590
we're just now we're doing kind of cohorts and segments,

647
00:32:22.591 --> 00:32:26.340
but you like the older people do churn faster,
right?

648
00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:27.810
So it's like everybody,

649
00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:31.590
it's almost like you have so many different customers segments to to model that

650
00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:32.760
it gets a little bit confusing.

651
00:32:32.761 --> 00:32:35.850
So what we've started to do is now just focus on our target,
our sweet spot,

652
00:32:35.851 --> 00:32:37.750
like all our,
our revenue,
our user growth,

653
00:32:37.751 --> 00:32:41.120
that referrals are all like 25 36 is sort of our sweet spot.

654
00:32:41.121 --> 00:32:44.210
So really focusing on on in that cohort,

655
00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:46.880
are we getting bad churn and we don't want bad turn in that cohort.

656
00:32:46.881 --> 00:32:49.820
But if in the other cohorts were kind of okay because they're a little bit

657
00:32:49.821 --> 00:32:51.530
outside of our sweet spot.

658
00:32:51.531 --> 00:32:56.270
So it's going to just being like super focused on and if the bad and it's the

659
00:32:56.271 --> 00:32:58.820
people turned out why they did and you can kind of see,
you can sort of,

660
00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:00.380
the cool thing about the,

661
00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:04.160
just having all the data is you can literally see someone's exact experience who

662
00:33:04.161 --> 00:33:05.810
they saw if they liked them,

663
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:08.870
maybe they saw a terrible profile and like disabled their account.

664
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:09.950
You can actually go and see that.

665
00:33:09.951 --> 00:33:14.420
So you can kind of track back what caused users to churn.
And,
and usually it is,

666
00:33:14.421 --> 00:33:17.660
uh,
it usually is like a lack of,
for us it's a lack of matches,

667
00:33:17.661 --> 00:33:20.780
which means that's why we were so focused on improving the algorithm because

668
00:33:20.781 --> 00:33:24.320
that's going to increase retention a ton.
If you get one good match a week,

669
00:33:24.321 --> 00:33:25.910
you're going to stay on,
even if it's only one.

670
00:33:25.911 --> 00:33:28.610
But if we're not giving you one for three weeks,
you're going to churn.

671
00:33:28.611 --> 00:33:33.350
So for us that's optimizing the algorithm better to to make sure you're not

672
00:33:33.351 --> 00:33:35.070
getting,
you're here getting good,

673
00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:37.490
you're getting good matches and we're not getting them all at once at the

674
00:33:37.491 --> 00:33:38.780
beginning and burn through them.

675
00:33:38.781 --> 00:33:42.530
So that's sort of the other game theory part is that I think gets into ethics a

676
00:33:42.531 --> 00:33:45.200
little bit is like do you give everyone their best matches right at the

677
00:33:45.201 --> 00:33:47.980
beginning or do you sprinkle in different,
you know,

678
00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:51.890
offering so that you are always are liking the the guy we think you should.

679
00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:53.810
Like when you only have,
you know,

680
00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:57.890
a hundred or a couple thousand people signed up in a city,
who do you let in?
Um,

681
00:33:57.950 --> 00:34:01.970
right now we've started moving into an entirely like predictive model based um,

682
00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:05.740
selection.
Where rather than us being like,
Oh,
you're a look like a good,

683
00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:08.450
you'd be good for the brand,
you integrated school,
you have a great profile.

684
00:34:08.451 --> 00:34:09.470
Like let's put you in instead.

685
00:34:09.471 --> 00:34:12.500
We actually look and see did their preferences overlap with other people and are

686
00:34:12.501 --> 00:34:14.450
they going to have that good time inside?

687
00:34:14.451 --> 00:34:18.260
Because if the girl only like 60 year old men and we don't have any six year old

688
00:34:18.261 --> 00:34:21.500
men and she's not going to have a good time at the party.
So obviously so.

689
00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:22.460
So it's,

690
00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:26.000
it's interesting cause you can start to kind of almost launched with people that

691
00:34:26.001 --> 00:34:28.130
you are predicting are to find a match.

692
00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:32.120
So now we're almost predicting matches like weeks in advance of when we launched

693
00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:34.820
the cities and we're only launching with people we think are going to get a

694
00:34:34.821 --> 00:34:36.370
match.
So yeah,
it's,

695
00:34:36.371 --> 00:34:39.410
it's a totally different strategy than kind of before when it was very guesswork

696
00:34:39.411 --> 00:34:41.540
and like oh these are people that we think we're going to match.

697
00:34:41.541 --> 00:34:45.110
But it was very human and now it's completely data driven based on you know,

698
00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:47.000
their pickiness well if it's a brand new user,

699
00:34:47.001 --> 00:34:49.910
it's based on just users that resemble them and what they've,

700
00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:53.030
they've seen in the past and we can kind of predict what the behavior is going

701
00:34:53.031 --> 00:34:56.540
to be once we launched this year.
The city.
Um,

702
00:34:56.660 --> 00:35:00.340
I have a question about how you choose what's a good education.

703
00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:02.780
So activity if it's level or a school,

704
00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:06.680
cause I feel like I know in 2013 actually Laszlo came out and said that GPA was

705
00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:09.930
totally agnostic to Googlers success.
Yeah.

706
00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:12.270
So it actually wasn't indicative of anything.

707
00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:14.900
The only thing he said that wasn't the New York Times is conversation and

708
00:35:14.901 --> 00:35:19.730
interviewing.
And so given that a lot of schools,
um,
you know,

709
00:35:19.731 --> 00:35:22.250
you can make arguments that some schools are better than others,

710
00:35:22.251 --> 00:35:24.260
but also there's a lot of industry specific knowledge.

711
00:35:24.261 --> 00:35:26.080
It comes from particular schools.
So we value,

712
00:35:26.081 --> 00:35:28.850
we've valued profession like just as high as education.

713
00:35:28.851 --> 00:35:32.420
So is the education like what school you go to or what level of education

714
00:35:32.421 --> 00:35:36.830
program base,
like what metric do like a medical school.

715
00:35:36.831 --> 00:35:38.460
So if went to any medical school in the United States,

716
00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:41.970
that's considered a highly selective in our,
like in our tiering system.

717
00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:43.680
So like for the particular undergraduate,

718
00:35:43.681 --> 00:35:47.410
like Oh this is an ivy league school versus this is,
so for all,

719
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:50.640
we have three categories we call a school.
Highly selective,
selective,

720
00:35:50.641 --> 00:35:54.690
or it's just not tagged.
So you mark every school and programs.

721
00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:59.220
So like for instance,
if you're,
like you said,
a doctor,
if you're,
if you're,
uh,

722
00:35:59.310 --> 00:36:02.670
in a doctor's program at University of Alabama,
that is highly selective.

723
00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:07.500
You're studying to be a doctor,
right?
So it's,
it's,
it's program based.
Yeah.
Okay.

724
00:36:07.501 --> 00:36:09.720
So that was my question was like what type of Algorithmic,

725
00:36:09.721 --> 00:36:12.000
like how do you approach that algorithmically or using,
well,

726
00:36:12.001 --> 00:36:14.310
we haven't done anything super cool yet,

727
00:36:14.311 --> 00:36:19.180
but right now it's sort of in like v two stage where we're kind of a,

728
00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:22.200
we've label,
we have,
we've sort of had the data sent tagged,

729
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:24.030
but he's not very international right now.

730
00:36:24.031 --> 00:36:27.300
So we're kind of adding in more international programs.
And now that we're,

731
00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:30.120
we're in London and Toronto,
so we,
we learned a lot of like,
oh,

732
00:36:30.121 --> 00:36:31.500
we didn't have this school in our database.

733
00:36:31.501 --> 00:36:34.650
So now we're kind of crowd sourcing a bunch of the schools and the programs and

734
00:36:34.651 --> 00:36:37.530
everyone writes him a little bit different on linkedin.
So it's not perfect.

735
00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:40.620
But if we see like we can look for the word,
you know,

736
00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:44.580
MD or something to show that they are kind of investing in higher education and

737
00:36:44.581 --> 00:36:47.540
that sort of the,
the way we're trying to kind of proxy it,

738
00:36:47.541 --> 00:36:51.540
and I like to think of the education is it's less of a,
I think people use it as,

739
00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:55.590
as a proxy for like,
I wouldn't say ambition,

740
00:36:55.591 --> 00:36:59.760
I guess it would say the way,
the way that people I've seen use it,

741
00:36:59.761 --> 00:37:03.090
like I've actually watched different people use the filters and it is,

742
00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:05.450
it is definitely for people with graduate degrees.

743
00:37:05.451 --> 00:37:08.250
He's like the only people that care about it are the ones that graduate degrees.

744
00:37:08.251 --> 00:37:11.820
And I think it is because they tend to want to find someone that shares their

745
00:37:11.821 --> 00:37:14.160
values and that is in there kind of industry.
Right.

746
00:37:14.161 --> 00:37:15.630
So we've noticed that I looked at,

747
00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:19.530
we did an analysis on who actually uses the education filter and it's usually

748
00:37:19.531 --> 00:37:23.100
people in their thirties and with a graduate degree,
doctor,
lawyer,

749
00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:27.270
something like that.
So,
but yeah,
it's interesting to see how like,

750
00:37:27.271 --> 00:37:30.540
who uses these and who doesn't.
And it's,
it's pretty,
uh,

751
00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:33.610
it's pretty interesting.
We should write a book sometime but,

752
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:36.410
but the good news is though,
if anyone's read data Clemson,

753
00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:39.450
which was kind of the last big book written about online dating,
um,

754
00:37:39.451 --> 00:37:42.180
we want to kind of do an update to that by the good news is a lot of the kind of

755
00:37:42.181 --> 00:37:43.980
like terrible trends he talks about,

756
00:37:43.981 --> 00:37:47.550
which you know is still true across the board in dating.
But it they are going,

757
00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:49.710
they are getting better.
Like people are getting more open minded,

758
00:37:49.711 --> 00:37:51.480
people are getting and was raised is done online dating.

759
00:37:51.481 --> 00:37:55.560
People are getting less hightest,
less elitist.
Like we've noticed it in our,

760
00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:59.280
our data even in the past three years like people are becoming more open minded

761
00:37:59.281 --> 00:38:01.560
on online dating and it just,
it's a shift that takes time.

762
00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:04.920
So I think as much as we can like be mad about it and hate the space,

763
00:38:04.921 --> 00:38:08.490
I think it is improving these products using more authentication,

764
00:38:08.491 --> 00:38:09.900
getting more information about these are,

765
00:38:09.901 --> 00:38:13.740
I think it is helping us as a society kind of make better matches for ourselves.

766
00:38:13.741 --> 00:38:17.610
So I would,
I would disagree with the point that like it's causing people to be,

767
00:38:17.611 --> 00:38:18.930
you know,
more elitist.

768
00:38:18.931 --> 00:38:21.810
I actually think it's because you're able to see all these people that you

769
00:38:21.811 --> 00:38:25.020
weren't able to see before and your homogeneous,
you know,
Google,

770
00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:27.820
Google life or whatever you were at in my life with San Bernardino,

771
00:38:27.821 --> 00:38:31.950
I took one bus back and forth.
So it's like I didn't get out of my comfort zone.

772
00:38:31.951 --> 00:38:32.970
So I like to think that,

773
00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:36.040
I mean in a study just came out actually that online dating is,

774
00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:40.510
is actually widening people's,
um,
like you know,
preferences.

775
00:38:40.511 --> 00:38:43.690
And also there's a lot more interracial marriages happening just because of the

776
00:38:43.691 --> 00:38:48.520
surge of online dating,
which they're attributing it 100% to online dating.

777
00:38:48.521 --> 00:38:51.490
So that just came out in,
I'll send you guys to,
to follow up.

778
00:38:51.491 --> 00:38:54.100
But that just came out in I think the New York Times or something about,

779
00:38:54.101 --> 00:38:58.090
about how online dating is resulting in kind of a more,
uh,

780
00:38:58.120 --> 00:38:59.650
open minded society.

781
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.170
<v 0>I'll do an question from the dory from someone who's watching in the livestream.</v>

782
00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:07.930
You keep using the term singles,

783
00:39:07.931 --> 00:39:11.650
but open relationships and polyamory are becoming more and more prevalent

784
00:39:11.651 --> 00:39:15.250
nowadays.
This,
the league explicitly tried to avoid such users.

785
00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:18.940
It doesn't seem to discriminate against singles and open relationships,

786
00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:22.510
but does have a bias against openly married?
What's your take?

787
00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:25.160
<v 2>Yeah,
it's a good,
it's a good question.
Um,</v>

788
00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:28.190
I think when we launched we want it to be really clear about what the product

789
00:39:28.191 --> 00:39:30.260
was and what the brand was,
what the,
what the offering was.

790
00:39:30.261 --> 00:39:35.090
So it was for people looking for long,
long or serious relationships,
soul mates,

791
00:39:35.330 --> 00:39:36.530
life partners.
Um,

792
00:39:36.531 --> 00:39:40.550
it wasn't for casual sex and it wasn't for a person in an open relationship

793
00:39:40.551 --> 00:39:45.320
trying to find another person to add to their people.
So,
I mean,
it was,

794
00:39:45.321 --> 00:39:48.680
if that was,
it was a very kind of like core focused use case.
Like I said,

795
00:39:48.681 --> 00:39:49.760
I was designing it for myself,

796
00:39:49.761 --> 00:39:52.170
to me that that wasn't gonna help me solve my problem more.

797
00:39:52.171 --> 00:39:54.110
So I designed it to be,
you know,

798
00:39:54.111 --> 00:39:57.940
to speak very clearly about why you should be there.
I think we've,

799
00:39:57.950 --> 00:39:58.790
we've kicked out,

800
00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:02.390
we kicked out a couple of people that were married and using it for open

801
00:40:02.391 --> 00:40:05.030
relationships.
And I think I,
I think that's,

802
00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:09.380
it's the way I think about it is there's a ton of dating apps out there and they

803
00:40:09.381 --> 00:40:10.071
are all,

804
00:40:10.071 --> 00:40:13.640
it's getting more and more like niche and fragmented and use case specific.

805
00:40:13.641 --> 00:40:17.780
So I mean I think I can even name some that are like designed for three ways are

806
00:40:17.781 --> 00:40:20.630
designed for polyamory.
So I think,
I think that,
um,

807
00:40:20.631 --> 00:40:22.310
instead of trying to be everything to everyone,

808
00:40:22.311 --> 00:40:27.230
why don't we just get really good at,
at the,
the demographic we have and uh,

809
00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:29.330
assume that someone else will kind of take that opportunity.

810
00:40:29.331 --> 00:40:31.370
I guess one thing I've learned the last three years,

811
00:40:31.371 --> 00:40:34.100
it's like you can't go after every opportunity.
I know you're going to,

812
00:40:34.101 --> 00:40:36.950
you're going to burn out.
And we have,
so it's like you have to,

813
00:40:36.951 --> 00:40:38.570
you have to make hard,
hard decisions.

814
00:40:38.571 --> 00:40:41.300
And I think for us it's like I can't worry about the over 40 year olds and I

815
00:40:41.301 --> 00:40:44.290
can't worry about the,
you know,
you can't worry about the,

816
00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:47.150
the polyamorous and the open relationship people because they're not

817
00:40:47.151 --> 00:40:50.390
contributing meaningfully to like actually our,
you know,

818
00:40:50.391 --> 00:40:53.510
our core business that we're building our core company that we're building.

819
00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:53.751
Right.

820
00:40:53.751 --> 00:40:57.170
So it's like you have to support the users that are funding you and then let's

821
00:40:57.171 --> 00:41:00.200
build them a product and then if we can kind of get that right,

822
00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:03.140
then there's a lot more products and people to build for.

823
00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:06.590
So I kind of think of that as like when we have an r and d department.
Sure.

824
00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:12.740
Okay.
Oh,
I have a question.
Um,
how do you get started?

825
00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:14.700
Like,
um,
you got you,

826
00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:19.120
I heard you say you got four people and how they do get three other people on

827
00:41:19.121 --> 00:41:23.700
board with you.
Yeah.
It looks like Linkedin is kind of critical to,

828
00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:25.380
to y'all two days.
Uh,

829
00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:29.810
how did you get partnership with them and were you like worried if they like,

830
00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:33.310
is it open API or something?
Like you see it going?

831
00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:36.810
Who is draw that at some point?
Yes,
that's a good question.
Um,

832
00:41:36.830 --> 00:41:39.740
the linkedin thing is interesting now that they're bought by Microsoft

833
00:41:39.741 --> 00:41:42.200
especially,
but um,
we were there,

834
00:41:42.201 --> 00:41:44.780
we were like the first one to use them and they were like,
wait,

835
00:41:44.781 --> 00:41:46.580
a dating site wants to use us.
I was like,

836
00:41:46.581 --> 00:41:49.640
you guys have the best day to say in the world.
Of course I want to use it.

837
00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:53.180
So we kind of got grandfathered in because we,

838
00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:56.420
because people are actually creating linkedin accounts to join our APP,

839
00:41:56.421 --> 00:41:59.420
which is like really high friction versus when you're paying for a user,

840
00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:01.520
you're like,
what?
So we,

841
00:42:01.521 --> 00:42:04.970
but we were giving them like users in an in a sense because people are like,
oh,

842
00:42:04.971 --> 00:42:06.530
I need a linkedin account.
I don't want to pay,

843
00:42:06.531 --> 00:42:09.260
so I'll go create a linkedin account and then authenticate.
So,

844
00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:12.800
so I think they saw that there's clear like benefit in new users.

845
00:42:12.801 --> 00:42:16.340
So it's sort of,
we kind of positioned it that way.
It's like we'll be,

846
00:42:16.610 --> 00:42:19.610
we'll be giving you new leads and we're not going to do anything spammy or

847
00:42:19.611 --> 00:42:23.650
anything weird.
We're just literally using,
displaying the data.
So,
so they,

848
00:42:23.730 --> 00:42:27.800
they actually have cut off their API access now the public profile view.

849
00:42:27.801 --> 00:42:31.970
So we actually are grandfathered into like a pretty nice little moat I guess we

850
00:42:31.971 --> 00:42:35.270
have from ABF some extra API permissions.
Um,

851
00:42:35.271 --> 00:42:39.780
your other question was about sort of starting start.

852
00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:41.620
How so?
Yeah,
so the starting was funny.

853
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:43.640
This is why now we're doing these small cities.

854
00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:47.750
I'm having like flashbacks to when I was in San Francisco and literally going

855
00:42:47.751 --> 00:42:50.240
door to door and knocking and be like,
do you know any single people?

856
00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:55.670
Can you text them right now?
And I need like 200 more people so we can launch.

857
00:42:55.671 --> 00:42:59.390
So what I did is I set myself a goal of like 300 guys and 300 girls and we

858
00:42:59.391 --> 00:43:01.820
actually built it into the waitlist screen.

859
00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:06.290
I'm like a little progress bar of like how many more women and men were needed

860
00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:10.550
to get to like the 300.
And so,
um,
which was kind of overkill.

861
00:43:10.551 --> 00:43:13.400
I guess I'm a feature because it was only pertinent for,
you know,

862
00:43:13.401 --> 00:43:16.490
from zero to 300 and then it was sort of outdated at that point.

863
00:43:16.491 --> 00:43:21.410
But it took a long time to get to zero to 300 in each gender category.
So,
um,

864
00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:23.720
but yeah,
that was sort of the goal is once we got to 300,

865
00:43:23.721 --> 00:43:25.600
we are going to launch and see if it worked.

866
00:43:25.601 --> 00:43:27.530
And it's obviously very small number of users.

867
00:43:27.531 --> 00:43:31.550
So that was also why there's only three to five potentials given every day.

868
00:43:31.551 --> 00:43:35.060
Cause I was like well how do we launch this?
And we,
you know,
with,

869
00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:39.260
cause it was in the era of like unlimited swipes and tenure was giving everybody

870
00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:42.440
as many as you wanted.
So um,
we actually kind of stole,

871
00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:45.890
not stole I guess pulled a page out of the coffee meets Bagel and hinges book

872
00:43:45.891 --> 00:43:49.310
cause they were doing the kind of daily batch thing.
And I was like,

873
00:43:49.311 --> 00:43:53.390
well let's do that and make it more fun,
like happy hour.
And then,
um,

874
00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:57.170
and so that's why we give only three to five a day so that we don't have to be

875
00:43:57.171 --> 00:43:59.930
concerned about supply issues,
especially upon launch.
Right.

876
00:43:59.931 --> 00:44:02.480
Because some of the people were launching and they only have,

877
00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:05.630
I think we only have like a hundred people ready to show them.

878
00:44:05.631 --> 00:44:08.330
And then we are kind of betting that we'll be acquiring more people and they'll

879
00:44:08.331 --> 00:44:09.680
be coming in.
And so you'd have to,

880
00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:14.060
you have to kind of figure out how much of a archive or I guess backlog you have

881
00:44:14.061 --> 00:44:18.230
to kind of create first before you launch.
So you know how many you need.

882
00:44:18.231 --> 00:44:22.790
So we found that it's about 300 guys and 300 girls is sort of the minimum you

883
00:44:22.791 --> 00:44:27.020
need,
cause you have to assume that like 70 70% might log in.
Right.

884
00:44:27.021 --> 00:44:29.660
And then of the ones that log in,
they might not some guy be picky.

885
00:44:29.661 --> 00:44:33.090
So you kind of want to make sure that have enough people that actually had a

886
00:44:33.091 --> 00:44:35.940
good experience at the end of that kind of first launch experience.

887
00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:37.600
<v 4>Okay.
Uh,</v>

888
00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:42.040
so the first question kind of piggybacks off of what you just mentioned and the

889
00:44:42.041 --> 00:44:44.080
other one is completely different.
Um,

890
00:44:44.110 --> 00:44:47.050
so how did you guys originally get to that number?
300?

891
00:44:48.310 --> 00:44:52.510
<v 2>It's kind of random I guess.
Um,
yeah,
I think we a couple of different ways.</v>

892
00:44:52.511 --> 00:44:53.560
You're kind of triangulated it.

893
00:44:53.561 --> 00:44:57.190
So one was that was just the number I picked for launching San Francisco.

894
00:44:57.191 --> 00:45:01.420
So that was me being very,
I guess,
uh,
you know,
cursory.

895
00:45:01.421 --> 00:45:03.430
And then the second piece was we now looked,

896
00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:07.360
we did this model that predicts how many happy people are going to be in a

897
00:45:07.361 --> 00:45:08.740
cohort on a wait list.

898
00:45:08.741 --> 00:45:13.600
So we can see in Indianapolis there's 438 people of the like 2000 that we

899
00:45:13.601 --> 00:45:18.190
predict will like have a good time in the party.
So that's sort of the,

900
00:45:18.250 --> 00:45:20.950
it's a little bit of how many people do you need to make sure there's going to

901
00:45:20.951 --> 00:45:25.030
be a good amount of happy users.
So that's sort of where that 300 comes from.

902
00:45:25.031 --> 00:45:25.810
Cause if we've,

903
00:45:25.810 --> 00:45:30.640
we've found that if there's at least 400 is about the right happy users.

904
00:45:30.641 --> 00:45:33.340
So then you add that you assume not all of them log in and stuff,

905
00:45:33.341 --> 00:45:35.350
so you get to kind of about 300,
300.

906
00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:37.220
<v 4>Okay,
cool.
Uh,</v>

907
00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:41.860
and question two is you mentioned that you did a incubator through the nights.

908
00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:43.930
Yeah.
Because after you're working here,

909
00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:46.540
<v 2>yeah,
it was like Google.
Um,
how's the SF office though?</v>

910
00:45:46.541 --> 00:45:50.020
So it's easier to commute to it,
but it was at,
um,
it was women 2.0 put it on.

911
00:45:50.021 --> 00:45:54.040
But it was for men and women.
Um,
it was just called,
I have now,
I can't remember,

912
00:45:54.041 --> 00:45:58.960
I just call it like a,
I don't know,
innovation program or something,

913
00:45:58.961 --> 00:46:00.910
but,
but yeah,
it was cool just cause it was,

914
00:46:00.970 --> 00:46:04.300
it got you in the emotion but you weren't,
you know,
it wasn't your day job.

915
00:46:04.301 --> 00:46:05.111
Everyone had a day job,

916
00:46:05.111 --> 00:46:08.560
so it was a little bit less intense and you got to kind of,
yeah,

917
00:46:08.561 --> 00:46:11.240
try your hand at it without having a ton of pressure.
Okay.

918
00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:14.520
<v 4>Cause that was the other question is how did you manage like doing that and</v>

919
00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:15.370
working here?

920
00:46:15.370 --> 00:46:19.910
<v 2>Oh yeah.
Well,
I didn't really,
I,
I know I worked,
I worked hard at Google,</v>

921
00:46:19.911 --> 00:46:21.920
so I did,
I just worked a lot.

922
00:46:21.921 --> 00:46:26.090
Like that was why when I was one of the reasons why I have relationship issues

923
00:46:26.091 --> 00:46:29.720
because I was working so hard.
So,
um,
so it all comes back,
right?

924
00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:32.990
It all comes back full circle.
Um,
but yeah,
I think,

925
00:46:32.991 --> 00:46:35.240
I think I just tried to balance it.
I,
I did a lot of that on the weekends.

926
00:46:35.241 --> 00:46:37.100
They'd would be like,
almost my whole weekend would be on that.

927
00:46:37.101 --> 00:46:41.000
And then at nights I would work till seven and then like work on it from seven

928
00:46:41.001 --> 00:46:44.120
to nine in like a conference room here and like just to hammer it out.

929
00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:49.070
So that's how I did the g match study for the gym out here too.
But yeah,

930
00:46:49.570 --> 00:46:53.270
maybe we have time for one more question.
Lucky purple back there.

931
00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:55.860
<v 4>Uh,
on business school.
Uh,
two things.
One,</v>

932
00:46:55.861 --> 00:46:58.770
a business school that was useful for starting a startup after two years at

933
00:46:58.771 --> 00:46:59.011
Google.

934
00:46:59.011 --> 00:47:01.350
Did you feel like you needed to go to business school to leave and sort of

935
00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:02.203
startup?

936
00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:07.240
<v 2>Yeah,
it's a really good question.
Um,
I think if you know,</v>

937
00:47:07.241 --> 00:47:11.710
you want to start a startup and you get into a top three business school,

938
00:47:11.770 --> 00:47:15.700
you should go because it's just,
it's going to help the process of starting up.

939
00:47:15.730 --> 00:47:18.940
It's just gonna it's,
it's worth the money.
I guess if you think about it,

940
00:47:18.941 --> 00:47:23.290
just like as a pure Roi based argument and like the amount of amazing people you

941
00:47:23.291 --> 00:47:27.730
can get mentored by the amount of like access to funding environment like you,

942
00:47:27.731 --> 00:47:31.660
you just,
you,
you paying opportunity,
right?
You're paying for opportunity to,

943
00:47:31.890 --> 00:47:35.230
to kind of be presented to you.
So I think,
I think if,
if that's it,

944
00:47:35.231 --> 00:47:37.000
but I don't think,
I think once you get out of the,

945
00:47:37.001 --> 00:47:39.250
like top one or two or three programs,

946
00:47:39.251 --> 00:47:43.030
I then I think it becomes a lot about what are you going to learn that is going

947
00:47:43.031 --> 00:47:46.700
to change the trajectory of your career,
right?
Because I think,
um,

948
00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:48.310
and you don't know if you want to be,

949
00:47:48.311 --> 00:47:52.270
I guess a lot of our funding came from connections I made at Stanford.

950
00:47:52.271 --> 00:47:55.570
So that's why I,
I can't,
with a straight face say you didn't need to go.

951
00:47:55.571 --> 00:48:00.520
I didn't need to go,
but like did I use anything I learned from business school?

952
00:48:00.521 --> 00:48:05.170
I feel like I knew what I didn't know.
Like I knew enough about the,

953
00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:07.810
cause we've studied entrepreneurship for like two years.
So you know enough of,

954
00:48:07.811 --> 00:48:10.210
you've heard enough horror stories and terrible stories.

955
00:48:10.211 --> 00:48:12.700
You kind of know that you need to hire someone or you know,

956
00:48:12.701 --> 00:48:14.380
you should be doing this as a model or you know,

957
00:48:14.381 --> 00:48:18.250
you should be doing more data analysis there so you kind of know your blind

958
00:48:18.251 --> 00:48:19.840
spots a little bit.
So I think you can kind of,

959
00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:23.230
you run your company better because you have that knowledge.

960
00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:27.730
But I don't think it's like a huge,
I don't think it's a huge,
besides that,

961
00:48:27.731 --> 00:48:32.170
like access to funding and obviously the network that helps,
helped us launch,

962
00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:33.550
launch the league,

963
00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:37.680
the League specifically because there's a lot of Stanford people on it.
But yeah,

964
00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:39.340
I dunno,
I guess I would say if you know,

965
00:48:39.341 --> 00:48:42.220
you want to start a company and you yeah,
you get into a place like Stanford,

966
00:48:42.221 --> 00:48:45.130
like there they are born and bred to like,
you know,

967
00:48:45.131 --> 00:48:47.530
put entrepreneurs out into the world.
So they're very good at,

968
00:48:47.590 --> 00:48:48.430
they're very good at that.

969
00:48:48.431 --> 00:48:51.040
And I felt very confident coming out and starting a company and I think that's

970
00:48:51.041 --> 00:48:53.860
like hard to value,
like that confidence and the ability to,

971
00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:58.300
especially as a single founder,
no opponent,
double entendre.
I know,
but uh,

972
00:48:58.390 --> 00:49:01.180
especially as a single founder,
I think having that like degree,

973
00:49:01.181 --> 00:49:03.510
even though it's a little like,
I don't like credential.

974
00:49:03.530 --> 00:49:05.890
Like I think I don't care that much about pedigree,

975
00:49:05.891 --> 00:49:10.120
but I do think it helps you just kind of walk into a room and be like,
yes,

976
00:49:10.121 --> 00:49:11.530
I'm fundraising.
Yes,
I'm doing this,
you know,

977
00:49:11.531 --> 00:49:13.390
and having people take you seriously.
So I do.

978
00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:18.340
I do think there's something there that you have to give credit for.
But yeah,

979
00:49:18.341 --> 00:49:21.010
I'm not like super bowl.
I mean,
it's expensive.
It's an expensive project,

980
00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:25.870
business school.
So I had a lot of sleepless nights about it before I went.

981
00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:31.030
It's time's up.
So thank you everyone for coming and thank you,
Amanda.
Yeah,

982
00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:32.900
so fun.
Great question.
