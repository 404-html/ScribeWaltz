1
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.810
Wanting to play a really quick video,

2
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.950
mostly because it's been a long time in the making and I kind of feel like we

3
00:00:11.951 --> 00:00:15.550
should put it to use so it's 90 seconds.
Obviously hosted on Youtube,

4
00:00:15.551 --> 00:00:18.270
so we're all good there and it

5
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.460
<v 0>in May of 2014 I sat in a Boston airport with my life sitting next to me in a</v>

6
00:00:24.461 --> 00:00:28.060
hulking baby blue roller bag and a one way ticket to New Zealand in my hand.

7
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.500
I had a dream to chase the jump to make and someday a book I wanted to write

8
00:00:32.501 --> 00:00:35.470
about how and when to go do it.
Before I boarded this flight,

9
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.320
I asked a stranger to take this video.
As I spun my racket,

10
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.330
I was off to play the professional squash.

11
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.070
Squash is a niche racket sport in squash.
You spend the racket to start a match.

12
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.600
I was beginning to start my own.
I've plans were for a few months,
maybe three,

13
00:00:49.601 --> 00:00:53.560
maybe six if I was lucky.
I figured I could couch surf for the first few weeks.

14
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.830
Stay with friends,
friends of friends whose families,
strangers,

15
00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.500
just so I could experience life for a little bit as they will live.

16
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.150
And then something funny happened.

17
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.810
The universe and hundreds of strangers helped to make my dream come true.

18
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.850
A few months turned into nearly two years,
200,000 miles,

19
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.910
six continents in about 50 countries.
In that time,

20
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.140
I spent nearly every night with other people.
Our tendency,
fellow bus passengers,

21
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.620
single parents to millennials has lept along farmlands and in skyscrapers to

22
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.230
long mountain tops and across villages.

23
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.910
I stayed with creators and makers and chefs and teachers,
skydivers,
farmers,

24
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.830
activists,
entrepreneurs.
Now four years later,
my next dream is coming true.

25
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.970
A book of a story made possible by these straight a book about when to chase

26
00:01:36.971 --> 00:01:37.804
your dreams,

27
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.730
a book about when to jump to the over 400 beautiful humans who gave me a place

28
00:01:42.731 --> 00:01:47.020
to stay and memory to treasury.
Thank you.
Truly.
Thank you.

29
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.690
I've got a couch with your name on it in San Francisco.

30
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.160
<v 1>I did not ever think,
and I truly believe this,
uh,</v>

31
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.590
that'd be standing here talking about this book.

32
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.750
And I first want to say thanks to Google for having me.

33
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.740
I also want to say thanks to Google headquarters in San Francisco.
Uh,

34
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.360
my roommate who pushed me to to see this book through works at ways,

35
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.960
and it was because of him that I was able to eat on Google's tab three to five

36
00:02:22.961 --> 00:02:26.080
days a week.
Still do.

37
00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.410
So hopefully this doesn't make its way.
It probably will.
Sorry,

38
00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.830
I am not an employee,
just a fan of the cafeteria.

39
00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.730
But I figured since we're in a smaller group,

40
00:02:36.731 --> 00:02:40.480
and this is one of the last events we'll do on the UK leg of the tour,

41
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.300
I'd love to tell just my story and,

42
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.980
and a little bit of the why and what made me want to put these stories together.

43
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.590
And then obviously we'd love to,

44
00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.140
to hear about yours and answering questions that might might come up.

45
00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.810
So backing up a bit,

46
00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.940
five years ago I was sitting in office and I,

47
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.110
I picked up a phone and called a woman who I had been reading about in a

48
00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:06.280
magazine on my desk.

49
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.170
And the article was about how this woman just competed in the 2012 Olympics here

50
00:03:12.171 --> 00:03:15.020
in London.
At the very end of the article,

51
00:03:15.021 --> 00:03:18.410
it talked about how she worked in a corporate job before becoming a cyclist.

52
00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.370
And the rest of the article was about the Olympics and how it felt and all this

53
00:03:22.371 --> 00:03:22.611
stuff.

54
00:03:22.611 --> 00:03:27.611
And all I cared about was was that transition of of doing something that

55
00:03:27.981 --> 00:03:31.580
probably wasn't expected or what was a bit of a surprise to her and maybe even a

56
00:03:31.581 --> 00:03:34.910
risk.
And she ended up picking up the phone,

57
00:03:34.911 --> 00:03:39.020
which was pretty weird looking back on it.
And her first question was,

58
00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.960
how'd you get my number?
And I said,
you know,
I just,
I'd love to know what,

59
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.700
what led you to take this jump

60
00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.690
and what she said over the next 45 minutes.

61
00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.430
It had nothing to do with being an Olympian or trying to train to become an

62
00:03:55.431 --> 00:04:00.431
athlete and everything to do with that voice in her head and conversations with

63
00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:06.620
their parents and what it felt like to think of failure and not maybe having a

64
00:04:06.621 --> 00:04:09.080
job again if she couldn't succeed at the next thing.

65
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.760
And it was funny because earlier that night I had googled when to chase your

66
00:04:13.761 --> 00:04:17.540
dreams.
Has anyone ever done that?
If you haven't,
don't,

67
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.050
I'll let,
I'll sum it up for you.
You get two things.

68
00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.400
One is a lot of the inspiration and like the feel good stories.

69
00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.870
And then on the other side you get the Instagram photos,

70
00:04:29.871 --> 00:04:33.320
the beautiful linkedin posts,
the Facebook news feed updates,

71
00:04:33.321 --> 00:04:35.330
which you kinda like really don't want to read.

72
00:04:35.331 --> 00:04:37.700
But they ended up reading and you're like,
oh my life sucks.

73
00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.570
How did this person make it?
How did this happen so easily?

74
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.140
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

75
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.390
<v 1>And while all of that's great and,
and the inspiration,</v>

76
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.880
certainly there were no lack of it on the Internet.

77
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.540
What really struck me was that there's a whole middle section of,

78
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.320
of doing what you love and that conversation with the cyclists covered what I

79
00:04:58.321 --> 00:05:01.920
call these 10,000 unsexy steps that go with chasing your dream,

80
00:05:01.921 --> 00:05:03.180
but no one talks about that.

81
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.180
You see the beginning and then you see kind of the fairytale ending,

82
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.020
but you don't talk about the restarts,
the failures,
the insecurities,

83
00:05:10.021 --> 00:05:14.400
that hesitations.
And to me,
sitting in that desk at work,

84
00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.390
it wasn't really about do I take this jump or not,

85
00:05:18.391 --> 00:05:21.180
it was about are there other people who have done something risky,

86
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.440
whatever that may be.

87
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.800
And so I thought back to 10 years earlier,
um,
I grew up in southern California.

88
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.390
And who your play squash.
Are there any squash players?
People one.
Okay.

89
00:05:33.391 --> 00:05:37.500
That's about average.
Okay.
Do you know what squash is?
Okay.

90
00:05:37.501 --> 00:05:40.200
That's when he,
many more than where I grew up,

91
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.040
everyone thought I was harvesting vegetables in the winter.
So,
uh,

92
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.220
there was one club within like 200 kilometers of where I grew up and it had the

93
00:05:49.291 --> 00:05:51.990
only courts in those 200 kilometers.

94
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.340
And I found it when I was 14 years old and I thought someday I'm going to play

95
00:05:56.341 --> 00:06:00.350
at the highest level is they don't know the pro squash tour.
What about you?

96
00:06:00.351 --> 00:06:01.650
You're the squash player.
Do you know of it?

97
00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.840
Oh well you are in the majority of people who don't know much about the pro

98
00:06:06.841 --> 00:06:08.570
squash store.
It's like the pro tennis tour.

99
00:06:08.571 --> 00:06:12.740
But the ugly stepchild that no one ever talks about.
It's similar.

100
00:06:12.741 --> 00:06:16.430
You play by yourself against somebody else,
but you don't make any money.

101
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.991
And in fact,

102
00:06:17.991 --> 00:06:21.350
when you have a tournament that goes through towns like ours in Santa Barbara,

103
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.940
the families that are part of the community,
we'll host a player.

104
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.770
So I signed up our family when I was 14 to host a traveling player and we had a

105
00:06:30.771 --> 00:06:34.340
conversation that would come back to me 10 years later in my office cubicle

106
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.200
after speaking to that woman who was the cyclist.
Because the,

107
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.840
the guy sitting across the table from me as a 14 year old said,
you know you,

108
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.440
you should do this.
If you get good enough,
you can play on mountains in Brazil.

109
00:06:45.441 --> 00:06:48.770
And,
and cities and Asian and go to Europe.

110
00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:50.280
<v 3>Okay.</v>

111
00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.740
<v 1>I had never been out of the country.</v>

112
00:06:51.741 --> 00:06:56.690
And so to me that was truly surreal to think there was a whole world out there

113
00:06:56.691 --> 00:06:57.650
that you could explore.

114
00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:04.160
And so I sat with this story from a woman 10 years later saying that you can

115
00:07:04.161 --> 00:07:05.990
chase your dreams,
but it's can be pretty tough

116
00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.050
and you're not alone in trying to do it.

117
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:14.270
And so I sketched a cover page and this was five years ago and I was with my

118
00:07:14.271 --> 00:07:17.390
buddy at work named Corey,
and we're the last two in the office.

119
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.880
Do you guys remember the Ice Bucket Challenge?
Yeah.

120
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:24.200
So Corey actually started that for his friend from Boston college named Pete

121
00:07:24.201 --> 00:07:28.670
[inaudible] who has als.
Cory was this larger than life guy.
I said,
Cory,

122
00:07:28.671 --> 00:07:29.570
this should be a book,

123
00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:32.120
but this should be actually a community where you can come together,

124
00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.210
share what you want to do,
have good food beers,

125
00:07:35.211 --> 00:07:37.280
talk about things that you might otherwise feel.

126
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.730
Weird dimension maybe it means totally changing everything.

127
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:44.930
And then maybe it's just doing something different on the weekends,

128
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:49.700
learning a new language,
volunteering.
I,

129
00:07:49.701 --> 00:07:53.930
it's hard to collect more of these stories and it just seemed like whether it

130
00:07:53.931 --> 00:07:56.610
was a fellow bus passenger or,

131
00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:02.120
or Cory next door or the lady down at the bar or the receptionist at the front

132
00:08:02.121 --> 00:08:04.160
desk,
everyone,
they had this little voice in their head.

133
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:08.900
And so was sharing this woman's story first anecdotally and then kind of writing

134
00:08:08.901 --> 00:08:12.080
it down and passing it around.
And to be honest,

135
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:14.720
the reason I said I didn't think I'd ever be here is cause I never really,

136
00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:16.730
I mean I guess I sketched to cover page,

137
00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:18.260
but I didn't think it actually be a book.

138
00:08:18.261 --> 00:08:22.460
I thought this would give me permission to tell my parents I'm not totally crazy

139
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.380
for leaving a job that I really cared about.

140
00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:29.030
I was working at a venture firm called Bain capital.
They're here,

141
00:08:29.031 --> 00:08:29.721
they're in Boston.

142
00:08:29.721 --> 00:08:34.721
I felt like I won the lottery to be in this role and I felt really kind of

143
00:08:35.841 --> 00:08:40.841
selfish to think of doing anything different than what my parents wanted,

144
00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:43.820
what my five siblings wanted for me.

145
00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:49.540
I felt like it'd be weird to bring up and yet here was the story that was giving

146
00:08:50.181 --> 00:08:51.014
me permission.

147
00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:56.160
And so I ended up joining the tour part time.

148
00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.940
I spent two years and saved up money.

149
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.880
I talked to my friends at work and my supervisor,
I said,

150
00:09:02.881 --> 00:09:06.630
I think I'm going to do this.
And I was not a very good squash player growing up.

151
00:09:06.631 --> 00:09:09.120
That's kind of a detail that the book leaves out.
Uh,

152
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:15.290
but I wanted to give it a try and over what I call these 10,000 unsexy steps of

153
00:09:17.791 --> 00:09:19.860
listened to the voice and then making a plan and,

154
00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:22.230
and saving up and playing tournaments.

155
00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:26.370
Actually got to play my first pro tournament while still at Bain took a sick
day.

156
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:28.380
I went down to Virginia.

157
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:33.000
I was playing the world number 90 to give you perspective,

158
00:09:33.001 --> 00:09:37.170
I was the world number 387 a which may or may not,

159
00:09:37.171 --> 00:09:41.250
should not sound impressive.
It,
especially that,
you know,
if you are,

160
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:44.970
you know,
have an Internet connection and pay a hundred pounds,

161
00:09:44.971 --> 00:09:48.750
you can be the world number three 87.
It is the last spot on the pro tour.

162
00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:51.450
So I had paid the money,
I was a pro player.
I go down,

163
00:09:51.451 --> 00:09:54.780
I'd been training feeling pretty good about myself and uh,

164
00:09:54.781 --> 00:09:57.210
I didn't score a point in the first match,

165
00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:02.250
which is actually really hard to do,
to not score point.
Um,

166
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.380
but I managed to do it.
My Dad had come down,

167
00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:05.820
we kind of looked at each other like,

168
00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:10.050
is this the thing you're about to quit your job to go do because it doesn't,

169
00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:11.003
might not add up.

170
00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:16.350
And then after a few more matches and a bunch more saving,

171
00:10:16.351 --> 00:10:17.490
I ended up leaving Bain.

172
00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:21.840
I took that video in the Boston airport and I moved to New Zealand.

173
00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:26.730
I thought three months would be at most the tour and I'd come back,

174
00:10:26.731 --> 00:10:27.640
maybe go to Grad school.

175
00:10:27.641 --> 00:10:30.610
That seems like what you do when you don't really know what you want to do.
Uh,

176
00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:34.110
at least to me that was,
that was a safe landing.
Maybe if they'd let me back,

177
00:10:34.111 --> 00:10:38.070
go back to Bain.
Three months,
turned into six months,

178
00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.650
the first month of tournaments,

179
00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:44.310
they were probably 20 guys there from 32 different countries.

180
00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:48.030
And one person passed me off to someone in Brazil and then Australia.

181
00:10:48.031 --> 00:10:50.760
And then someone who's someone in France and South Pacific,

182
00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:55.980
six months turned into 12 months,
turned into two years and every night.

183
00:10:55.981 --> 00:10:59.340
But one I was with other people.
And every time I sat down at a dinner table,

184
00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:01.560
someone would ask me about how I knew when to jump.

185
00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:05.390
And so I pull out this one story I had and I said,
yeah,

186
00:11:05.391 --> 00:11:08.490
I'm gonna make this a book someday.
Just like,
you know,

187
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:11.580
obviously it wasn't really going to happen in my mind.
I wasn't an author.

188
00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:15.610
And then sadly my buddy Corey,
uh,

189
00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:20.430
passed away really early on in my trip and it kind of hit me that,
you know,

190
00:11:20.431 --> 00:11:24.660
we have this much time or we have this much time to go do what we want to do.

191
00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:26.790
But we definitely would have this much time.

192
00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:32.070
And part of course legacy was taking an idea and making it something bigger.

193
00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.860
And so while I was playing squash,

194
00:11:34.861 --> 00:11:39.861
I started back on the project and I got to all different types of people.

195
00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:44.760
The second baseman for the Chicago cubs who left the cubs to go to college,

196
00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:48.420
the first female bishop in the Anglican Church who was in PR,

197
00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:53.100
people at tech companies like Google who had actually changed offices.

198
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:56.050
Continents stayed within the company but done something totally different.

199
00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:58.330
It really didn't matter what the jump was,
but it was,

200
00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:01.820
it was showing that there was people that were willing to take it and there was

201
00:12:01.821 --> 00:12:06.820
a community to support that.
And so I came back,
uh,
two years after leaving,

202
00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:09.790
my parents were like,
you really need to get a job now.

203
00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:16.180
And I stay on my buddy's couch in San Francisco when I figured out was in most

204
00:12:16.751 --> 00:12:18.400
cities in the world,
you're unemployed.

205
00:12:18.401 --> 00:12:22.240
If you're on your friend's couch in San Francisco,
you're an entrepreneur.

206
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.980
So I was sitting on my buddy's couch and it's the end of the year,

207
00:12:26.981 --> 00:12:30.700
there's a holiday party at,
someone invites me to,
I said,
sure,
you know,

208
00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:35.080
just come along and had been working on my stories,
started to interview for jobs

209
00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.720
and I bring my stories,
my backpack,
and I pull up a seat at this,

210
00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:45.030
this holiday party.
And the woman next to me,
I was supposed to talk,

211
00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:48.720
didn't know that at the time.
She was the keynote speaker and she's like,

212
00:12:48.721 --> 00:12:53.580
you know,
if you know,
what's your story?
I said,
well,

213
00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:57.090
and I kind of two decisions either tell her the real life thing,

214
00:12:57.091 --> 00:12:58.680
like I need a job running out of money.

215
00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:02.820
Parents expect me to get a job or I could dig it in my backpack.

216
00:13:02.821 --> 00:13:04.440
And sure the stories that have been working on.

217
00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:09.880
And so I pull into my backpack and I grabbed these stories and I'd used like

218
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:14.320
literally some of the last cash that I had saved up on the squash trip to get a

219
00:13:14.321 --> 00:13:16.690
graphic designer to make a logo.
I had a blog set up.

220
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:20.110
I've been rejected by every editor I could ever reach out to.

221
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:25.330
And when I told her was this someday will be a book and we're going to have

222
00:13:25.331 --> 00:13:28.960
these festivals where people can have beers and talk about what they want to do.

223
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:32.740
We're gonna have a podcast,
we're going to have a learning series.

224
00:13:32.741 --> 00:13:36.130
It's going to be about doing what you love in any way.

225
00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:40.390
And right now we're just starting with a blog,
but it's going to get there.

226
00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:44.220
And she said,
well,
you should,
you should tell these stories by video.

227
00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:49.650
And I was like,
lady,
you know,
that's nice,
but I'm on my buddy's couch.

228
00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:53.970
I got like four weeks left in the bank and everyone's told me I have to start

229
00:13:53.971 --> 00:13:58.260
with a blog.
She said,
well,
you know,
if it's helpful,

230
00:13:58.261 --> 00:14:01.380
like I think we could really help you out.
We'd love my company does video stuff.

231
00:14:01.381 --> 00:14:04.560
We could partner together.
Just give me,
shoot me an email if you'd like.
Said Oh,

232
00:14:04.561 --> 00:14:05.394
that'd be great.

233
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:09.180
So she hands me her card and I looked down at it says Arianna Huffington on it.

234
00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:13.530
And I said,
yeah,
you'll be hearing from me.
Yeah.
All of our,

235
00:14:13.531 --> 00:14:15.280
we'll reach out and my brand.
Yeah.

236
00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:19.440
And three weeks later I played my last squash tournament in New York City was my

237
00:14:19.441 --> 00:14:23.580
last provent and two hours before that I sat across 15 executives from

238
00:14:23.581 --> 00:14:26.460
Huffington Post.
And the first question was,
well,

239
00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:29.040
is this a brand or just a project?

240
00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:30.910
<v 3>Okay.</v>

241
00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:33.760
<v 1>As wearing the same thing I got off the tour wearing,</v>

242
00:14:33.761 --> 00:14:37.030
I had my backpack and I look over.
I said,

243
00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:43.780
it's obviously,
it's a brand.
We are a brand.
And they said,

244
00:14:43.781 --> 00:14:46.390
well,
we'd love to partner with you guys.
And said,
well,

245
00:14:46.391 --> 00:14:48.130
we'll think about that and we'll let you know.

246
00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.320
And then getting the elevator and what I,
what I,

247
00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:54.230
I Google before I get out of the elevator to leave the building,

248
00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:56.210
how do you start a brand?

249
00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:02.330
And three weeks later I'd met a literary agent.
She looked at me,
she said,

250
00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:07.040
I know people have rejected this,
but I think it may not be a book,

251
00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:10.430
but it should be a book.
And I'm willing to try,
try to take this on.

252
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:14.150
And when we started to collect more stories,

253
00:15:14.151 --> 00:15:19.151
I think it became apparent that when to jump wasn't about that big fairy tale

254
00:15:19.851 --> 00:15:23.390
ending that you see in moving the ball and everything just works out.

255
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:28.190
It was about taking agency over the small and big decisions in your life.

256
00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:33.650
And there's a lot of books out there on inspiration and self help and do these

257
00:15:33.651 --> 00:15:38.300
five things and it'll work out.
And I just think that's not how life works.
I,

258
00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:38.880
it's funny,

259
00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:43.820
I'm probably three weeks after we launched our partnership with huffpost and our

260
00:15:43.821 --> 00:15:45.680
brand began,
uh,

261
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:50.710
I was invited to partner with Airbnb and at this point I was just getting off my

262
00:15:51.171 --> 00:15:54.680
buddy's couch.
I told Airbnb we'd be thrilled to partner with them.

263
00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:56.800
And they had a,
uh,

264
00:15:56.870 --> 00:16:00.560
member festival that Ashton Kutcher and Gwenyth Paltrow were also speaking at.

265
00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:03.350
And they said,
why don't we start our collaboration with you?
You know,

266
00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:08.360
sharing the stage.
I was like,
can I get an autograph or is that weird?

267
00:16:08.361 --> 00:16:12.980
Like I've huge Kutcher Fan.
Anyway.
Uh,
I said,
yeah,
yeah,
we'll are,

268
00:16:12.981 --> 00:16:15.450
we have a platform we can come share that platform with you.

269
00:16:15.451 --> 00:16:18.020
And also if you spend enough time in silicon valley,

270
00:16:18.021 --> 00:16:20.510
you just throw a platform in any sentence possible.

271
00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:25.670
And so I go down to La and my parents came there sitting in the first row and

272
00:16:25.671 --> 00:16:28.910
doors hadn't opened yet and they came because we all figured it might just be

273
00:16:28.911 --> 00:16:33.860
them and that's totally cool.
Can always tell people I got to partner with Airbnb

274
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:39.110
and the talk was about how you can use airbnb to make a jump.

275
00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:44.150
It turns out that one in four hosts use airbnb to save up money to go do

276
00:16:44.151 --> 00:16:44.984
something different.

277
00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:49.520
So the door is open and we ended up with 2,500 people in the audience.

278
00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:55.460
Now I had already made a slide show then and I'd expect it to be,

279
00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:57.890
you know,
my parents and maybe a few friends.

280
00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:01.220
And so at the very end of the slideshow actually had an email address that went

281
00:17:01.221 --> 00:17:06.221
to me but was this email to our platform and I said to folks in the audience,

282
00:17:08.001 --> 00:17:08.211
you know,

283
00:17:08.211 --> 00:17:13.211
here's this email sends your jump for next year to our platform and we will

284
00:17:15.591 --> 00:17:20.590
follow along in what you're doing.
Cause we have a very,
you know,

285
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:24.170
throughout AI and smart learning and big data like blah,
blah blah,

286
00:17:24.171 --> 00:17:25.880
and we'll follow up with you.

287
00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:30.980
And I remember looking down at my phone afterwards and of course all these went

288
00:17:30.981 --> 00:17:32.810
to me.
So I opened my phone.

289
00:17:32.811 --> 00:17:37.811
It went from one in the inbox to 700 and that weekend I looked over 700 emails.

290
00:17:38.541 --> 00:17:42.420
And the crazy thing was
almost all,

291
00:17:42.421 --> 00:17:46.100
I think all but maybe 15 had nothing to do with,

292
00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:50.430
with changing your career.
It,
the little things,

293
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:52.583
it was like,

294
00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:57.060
I want to have a family and also pursue a career.

295
00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:01.430
I want to have more time for my kids on the weekends.
Uh,

296
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:02.940
I've always wanted to go to France.

297
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:07.800
So people were using the hosting income to make money and now they were thinking

298
00:18:07.801 --> 00:18:12.060
of this concept of jumping is like,
I want to control the time I have in my day.

299
00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:18.590
And I know that sounds probably contrived or Cliche,
but to me,
like I,

300
00:18:18.591 --> 00:18:22.360
I truly thought we'd never get to talk to companies because you might read the

301
00:18:22.361 --> 00:18:24.880
book title and be like,
well,
won't everybody leave?

302
00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:28.300
And now I can tell you,
I mean,
we,

303
00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:31.360
we reached 3 million people in our first video with huffpost.

304
00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.310
We've been fortunate that the,

305
00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:37.570
the festival concept has grown in and we're going to actually bring it to London

306
00:18:37.571 --> 00:18:41.950
this year.
We reached millions of people through our community and platform,

307
00:18:41.951 --> 00:18:46.450
and hopefully this book and very few of the jumps are actually about changing

308
00:18:46.451 --> 00:18:49.450
everything in your life.
You know,
people say chase your passion.

309
00:18:49.451 --> 00:18:54.100
I think that's really awkward and weird to have to like think about at

310
00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:55.870
lunchtime.
Um,

311
00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:00.250
I'm all about taking these little steps and finding that one or two things that

312
00:19:00.251 --> 00:19:04.700
kind of starts to change your day.
And so today,

313
00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:10.070
like I said,
the,
the platform is a platform,
uh,
which by the way,

314
00:19:10.071 --> 00:19:12.140
I got a lot of feedback from airbnb.
Fortunately,

315
00:19:12.141 --> 00:19:15.080
it was positive we were with him yesterday.
Uh,

316
00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:19.350
but the most common point of feedback was,
wow.
You know,

317
00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:22.310
people really felt like,
even though it was AI,

318
00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:26.610
they were talking to a human on the other side of the screen.
I was like,
I,
yeah,

319
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:29.270
have to tell our engineers,
great job.
Meanwhile,

320
00:19:29.271 --> 00:19:32.180
I was like [inaudible] me throwing out emails.

321
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:36.410
And so now we have a little bit more behind the platform.

322
00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:41.560
Now we're on when to jump.com.
We started a podcast where every,

323
00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:45.470
every Tuesday we have a 30 minute conversation with,
with anybody.

324
00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:47.600
It could be someone who moved within a company,

325
00:19:47.601 --> 00:19:50.620
it can be someone who moved around the world.
Uh,

326
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:55.430
my favorite conversations are with people like this gentleman last night in

327
00:19:55.431 --> 00:20:00.431
London who absolutely loves flowers and his jump is on the weekends.

328
00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:06.040
He brings his skills to events and it uses flowers to bring them to life.

329
00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.530
He's still project manager.
He works down the street from here,

330
00:20:09.531 --> 00:20:10.490
but that's his passion.

331
00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:15.830
And so we get enough of those kind of data points and we're now rolling out a

332
00:20:15.831 --> 00:20:19.070
directory where if you're a project manager,

333
00:20:19.071 --> 00:20:23.270
turns flower guy in London later this year,

334
00:20:23.271 --> 00:20:26.690
you'll be able to go and start typing.
Like who else is a flower person?

335
00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:31.400
And if you're traveling in Chicago for Work and you love baking,

336
00:20:31.401 --> 00:20:35.060
you can look up people who have jumped into baking and find those people.

337
00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:39.380
We're actually doing a private kind of buildup for that.
So if you,

338
00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:40.490
if you want to help me out on that,

339
00:20:40.491 --> 00:20:42.890
you can come find me because it's going to start small.

340
00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:48.010
But we think that someday there'll be a festival somewhere in the world,

341
00:20:48.011 --> 00:20:51.280
like in London this fall.
There'll be more books like this.

342
00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:54.360
There'll be companies like Google that support that idea.

343
00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:58.840
Think it's always an area one 20 that you guys have where people can actually

344
00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:03.190
take the full risk of jumping and not actually have to sacrifice so much on

345
00:21:03.191 --> 00:21:07.810
paper.
You know,
I wish I had that.
I wasn't so lucky in where I worked.

346
00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:11.490
I was lucky they supported it,
but it was pretty much all or nothing.
You know,

347
00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:13.810
there are organizations now that support the idea of jumping,

348
00:21:13.811 --> 00:21:15.460
because if you do it right,

349
00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:19.900
you actually have a meaningful career and you don't have to leave.
Uh,
we,

350
00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:22.610
we didn't have that at where I worked.
Uh,

351
00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:24.400
but I think that's the way the workforce is going.

352
00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:30.460
And so we hope we're creating that community,
uh,
through the podcast,

353
00:21:30.461 --> 00:21:34.780
through the book,
through this directory,
through bringing people together.
Um,

354
00:21:34.781 --> 00:21:38.800
and I think we're just getting started.
Um,
so with that,

355
00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:40.870
I want to thank you guys for having me.

356
00:21:40.871 --> 00:21:45.520
I'll stick around for Q and a a and be here afterwards to sign books.
Uh,

357
00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:48.580
but I hope this kind of touches on the real story behind the book and I

358
00:21:48.581 --> 00:21:51.490
appreciate you guys letting me come and tell him.
Thank you.

359
00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:56.970
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

360
00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:00.500
<v 4>so,
and we have about 15 minutes for Q and a.</v>

361
00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:02.510
So if anybody would like to ask a question,
um,

362
00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:04.190
we need to pass it on this microphone,

363
00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:09.410
but I'll start off by asking for people who aren't a hundred percent sure what

364
00:22:09.411 --> 00:22:13.370
their passion is,
but they know they want to explore something,

365
00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:15.890
whether it be more creative,
more engineering focused,

366
00:22:15.891 --> 00:22:16.880
and maybe their own startup.

367
00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:22.250
How do they discover that passion while also moving along this sort of journey?

368
00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:24.540
<v 1>Like I said,
I think that,</v>

369
00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:29.040
I think social media and pop culture really kind of overblown is this like,

370
00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:31.290
you know,
find your passion,
follow it.

371
00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:33.810
It's not like finding sugar at the grocery store,
you know,

372
00:22:33.811 --> 00:22:35.610
it's like those things take time.

373
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:41.470
You need to kind of first I think consider what makes you curious.
And,

374
00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:46.290
and there's a story in the book from a fitness entrepreneur and he has a great

375
00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:50.310
kind of piece of advice.
It's actually about training and being in the gym.

376
00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:51.870
And he says,
you know,
a lot of people,

377
00:22:51.871 --> 00:22:54.420
especially in the new year say I want to get fit.
And then he says,

378
00:22:54.421 --> 00:22:57.330
show me how you spend your time and I'll show you what your priorities are.

379
00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:59.790
Because most people say I'd love to get fit,

380
00:22:59.791 --> 00:23:02.640
but then they don't go to the gym but they don't work out.
Okay.

381
00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:05.000
And I think it's the same about,
you know,

382
00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:08.400
what do you like to do outside of work or if you want to become an engineer or

383
00:23:08.401 --> 00:23:12.480
you are you spending time towards that thing.
And if you don't know what it is,

384
00:23:12.481 --> 00:23:13.500
I would just say,
okay,

385
00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:17.100
take a morning and look at what you did the day before and see what,

386
00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.590
what caught your attention,
where you start spending time,

387
00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:22.020
what you were googling on after work.

388
00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:26.120
And I think from there you start to pull threads.
But for me,
you know,

389
00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:29.400
this was never,
this was a hope that we could bring the message out.

390
00:23:29.401 --> 00:23:31.740
But I think when to jump came out of being like,
okay,

391
00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.200
I just want to collect stories.
And then from that,

392
00:23:34.201 --> 00:23:35.280
other things started to evolve.

393
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:36.010
<v 4>Okay.</v>

394
00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:39.710
The second question before I open up to the floor and there's a massive nervous

395
00:23:39.711 --> 00:23:44.570
around nervousness around that moment while you were deciding to jump right

396
00:23:44.571 --> 00:23:45.920
through to jumping,

397
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:50.210
can you give any advice to everyone who's thinking about a transition right now,

398
00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:53.240
ways to approach it,
mindset to take,
you know,

399
00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:56.630
do you just go for it or do you really consider it take three months?

400
00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:58.213
What's your,

401
00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:00.960
<v 1>I don't know if this is weird to preface,</v>

402
00:24:00.961 --> 00:24:04.440
but I don't consider myself a self help guru or like,
you know,

403
00:24:04.441 --> 00:24:06.600
qualified to give everybody advice on their life.

404
00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:11.130
Think everyone lives in a life that's very complicated and specific to yours.

405
00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.730
And I can only reflect on like the research we've done around the book and,

406
00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:16.270
and being,
um,

407
00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:20.550
being lucky to spend time with people who have taken the steps to kind of think

408
00:24:20.551 --> 00:24:24.990
through their job.
Um,
for me it's,
it's,
it's how the book's organized.
So,

409
00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:29.460
uh,
there's four kind of phases that it seems like anyone goes through when they

410
00:24:29.461 --> 00:24:33.960
make a jump in their life.
Uh,
the first is listening to that little voice.

411
00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:35.730
The second one is making a plan,

412
00:24:35.731 --> 00:24:39.870
which is I think the bulk of it is like 10,000 unsexy steps.
Okay.

413
00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:43.860
Um,
that includes kind of sewing a safety net in your current job,

414
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:46.140
especially if you're looking to,
I think move internally.

415
00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:50.160
It seems like doing the job you're doing really well and getting a lot of

416
00:24:50.161 --> 00:24:54.570
support around that building a good kind of reputation is,
is,
uh,

417
00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:59.520
you know,
could kind of foundation to jump from.
And then there's letting,

418
00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:03.150
letting yourself be lucky.
So once you've actually planned the jump and you've,

419
00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:05.310
you've solved for all you can solve,

420
00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:07.800
I don't think there's ever a perfect time to go,

421
00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:11.210
but I think you've set yourself up to run into,
you know,

422
00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:12.750
fortuitous opportunities.

423
00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:16.170
And I think that's probably my favorite section of the book is hearing about

424
00:25:16.171 --> 00:25:20.250
people who just trusted your gut.
And that's,
by the way,
really hard.
But I think,

425
00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:23.520
you know,
to your question,
if,
if you do the other things,

426
00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:27.810
by the time you actually jumped there isn't as much of a downside.
Okay.
Yeah.

427
00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:30.390
Cool.
Thank you.
What are you would like to ask a question?

428
00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:34.983
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

429
00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:39.270
<v 4>It's a very open question.
Cool.
Give a really open just,
yeah.</v>

430
00:25:39.271 --> 00:25:43.920
It's like what's your,
I have read many books and they're mostly from Americans.

431
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:46.990
And when you try to apply them in the UK,
it sometimes doesn't,

432
00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:50.680
it mostly doesn't work.
So seems like you've been around 10,

433
00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:51.540
you've been in New Zealand,

434
00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:56.340
etc. How do we localize stuff like from your book or what we read around?

435
00:25:56.610 --> 00:26:01.560
<v 1>Yeah,
so the book has 44 stories that represent,
I don't think the,</v>

436
00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.230
the viewpoint of one nationality.

437
00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:07.440
There's a really strong immigrant thread through the book,
uh,

438
00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:11.640
from Chinese Americans to El Salvadorians to Nigerians.
Uh,

439
00:26:11.641 --> 00:26:14.670
we have several folks in the book from the United Kingdom and then we have

440
00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:17.700
people in the book that I just met while I was traveling,
people from,

441
00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:22.490
from New Zealand through Asia and hearing this or they're in the states.
Um,

442
00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:27.240
what I find really interesting,
maybe this isn't the answer the question,
but,
uh,

443
00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:32.100
I think that there's something fundamental to how you think about what you do

444
00:26:32.101 --> 00:26:36.360
every day.
I think we constantly,
as humans,
you know,

445
00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:38.610
it's part of being human,
wondering like,

446
00:26:38.611 --> 00:26:40.560
is this the way I'm supposed to be spending my time?

447
00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:45.330
I think that's the core of the book is it's not so much of jump because it's a

448
00:26:45.331 --> 00:26:48.120
cultural thing or you're a millennial.
You know,

449
00:26:48.121 --> 00:26:50.460
we have a woman who's 67 years old who's in the book,

450
00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:55.100
or we have a single mom in Boston.
We have an Indian woman in Guilford.

451
00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:57.540
Uh,
the,

452
00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:01.260
the powerful part to me is that given all the disparities,

453
00:27:01.261 --> 00:27:03.990
there's just fundamental truths that come out of this,

454
00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:09.510
this idea that we think about.
Um,
and maybe it won't,

455
00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:11.760
I,
it's actually,
I mean,
it's going great in the states,

456
00:27:11.761 --> 00:27:13.590
but we've had an amazing reception here,

457
00:27:13.591 --> 00:27:17.730
I think because maybe there isn't as much of a conversation openly about like

458
00:27:17.731 --> 00:27:19.740
going off the path we were at.

459
00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:23.790
We did an event with Lulu Lemon in one of the panelists was this Indian woman

460
00:27:23.791 --> 00:27:28.410
from Guilford who is in a career and worked in fashion on the side and ended up

461
00:27:28.411 --> 00:27:29.700
going into a Korean fashion.

462
00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:33.110
And we spent most of the time talking about British culture and,

463
00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:36.150
and kind of traditional cultures where that's not what your parents did.

464
00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:38.340
That's not what your friends are doing,
what that means,

465
00:27:38.341 --> 00:27:40.260
if you're culturally not supposed to do that.

466
00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:44.910
So I think we do a decent job of sharing those types of stories.

467
00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:50.100
Um,
we also have these festivals where we try to go into different areas.

468
00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:54.150
London will be our first one this September.
Um,
Abby's with me,

469
00:27:54.151 --> 00:27:56.100
she's our event director.
She's back there.

470
00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:59.850
If you're interested in like being a part of it or if you think there's things

471
00:27:59.851 --> 00:28:01.140
we should know as we planet,

472
00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:04.920
I'd be thrilled because we were spending this week kind of getting going or we

473
00:28:04.921 --> 00:28:08.040
also want to do something special for everyone at Google if they end up wanting

474
00:28:08.041 --> 00:28:08.874
to come.

475
00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.640
But I think it's important to like go there and learn the stories and be there.

476
00:28:11.641 --> 00:28:15.540
And I was lucky that squash gave me that kind of excuse to sit down and have

477
00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:18.850
thousands of these conversations.
But I'm sure there's stuff we're missing.

478
00:28:18.851 --> 00:28:21.060
And maybe that's,
that's for the next book.
I Dunno.

479
00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:27.550
And by the way,
as we pass it on my email,

480
00:28:27.551 --> 00:28:31.810
if you just email info@whentojump.com that goes to our platform,

481
00:28:31.811 --> 00:28:36.811
which I can promise you will come to me almost immediately and just say you want

482
00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:40.570
info in the London event and we'll make sure you're on the,
on the list.

483
00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:45.790
And I'm Abby's emails,
it just ABB why@whentojump.com.

484
00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:48.820
But like truly this is day two of thinking about what we'll do in September.

485
00:28:48.821 --> 00:28:51.040
So welcome all ideas and feedback.

486
00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:55.350
<v 5>Oh,
I have two questions in one.
This is working.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

487
00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:58.360
so the name of the book is when to jump,
not if to jump.

488
00:28:58.361 --> 00:29:00.550
So it kind of implies a positive outcome.

489
00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:04.930
So is it really always positive and I'm assuming that the 44 stories in the
book,

490
00:29:04.931 --> 00:29:06.820
since they made it to the book,
are positive.

491
00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:11.530
So what is the most blissful failure you've seen and what do you actually define

492
00:29:11.531 --> 00:29:12.610
as a failure in this case?

493
00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:18.810
<v 1>So your assumption is actually incorrect,
which is I think a good thing.
Um,</v>

494
00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:23.470
the fourth phase of this jump curve is don't look back and that's kind of code

495
00:29:23.471 --> 00:29:26.740
for being like the stories that didn't really go the way they thought.

496
00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:31.390
And I think that's important because it'd be a little weird to just show your 44

497
00:29:31.391 --> 00:29:34.900
stories where it just all was exactly as planned.
Um,

498
00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:38.230
we have both internal jumps that kind of didn't go as planned as well as people

499
00:29:38.231 --> 00:29:42.060
who took a big risk and it didn't work out.
Um,

500
00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:47.230
to me,
and again,
maybe this is just super optimistic,
but from,

501
00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:51.370
from every conversation I've had since five years ago,
talking about cyclists,

502
00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.860
the people who took the time to take that,

503
00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:57.670
that middle ground of planning and thinking,
budgeting,

504
00:29:57.671 --> 00:30:02.440
all the stuff that's really like not that riveting to talk about or share on

505
00:30:02.441 --> 00:30:05.140
Facebook and all that stuff.
If you went and did that,

506
00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:09.790
those people whose ended up,
you know,
jumped in,
it didn't really work out.

507
00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:13.120
It led them to something else that might still not be working out,

508
00:30:13.121 --> 00:30:14.770
but it's getting them closer to what they want to be doing.

509
00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:18.580
So no one that I've talked to who's followed kind of this framework,
if you will,

510
00:30:18.581 --> 00:30:21.340
these phases has regretted the decision.

511
00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:24.700
And in fact when I was taking the jump,

512
00:30:24.701 --> 00:30:27.250
I sought out people who's like fell on their face,

513
00:30:27.251 --> 00:30:31.180
jumped in like nothing worked and they were the biggest advocates and the

514
00:30:31.181 --> 00:30:34.340
loudest cheerleaders.
And I would challenge you to,

515
00:30:34.341 --> 00:30:38.560
to do the same if you're thinking about if rather than when like talk to the

516
00:30:38.561 --> 00:30:42.190
people who,
and I called,
there's three types of people you should talk to.
One,
uh,

517
00:30:42.191 --> 00:30:46.720
Switzerland who has like,
no,
you know,
total bias in one way or the other.
Like,

518
00:30:46.721 --> 00:30:50.470
not the person who's the massive jumper and not your parents who really don't

519
00:30:50.471 --> 00:30:54.880
want you to do it,
but Switzerland and then find the,

520
00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:55.983
the mist,

521
00:30:56.470 --> 00:31:00.040
which is like the person who missed the opportunity and it didn't jump because

522
00:31:00.041 --> 00:31:02.920
that's another theme is if you really want to go do what you're doing and you're

523
00:31:02.921 --> 00:31:05.500
worried about if you should do it,
talk to the people who,
who,

524
00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:08.440
who missed that chance.
Cause that that'll probably get you going.

525
00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:14.080
And then three would be oops,
which is the person who's jumped in exactly.

526
00:31:14.081 --> 00:31:14.914
Go as planned.

527
00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:20.260
And I would say say like that would be a first easy exercise to just find those

528
00:31:20.261 --> 00:31:20.981
types of people,

529
00:31:20.981 --> 00:31:24.970
the three folks and see what they have to say because then you'd be surprised.

530
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.290
I think the human psyche is one where we go to the worst possible place in our

531
00:31:29.291 --> 00:31:31.810
mind and that's not always very fair.

532
00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:33.710
<v 3>Thanks.
Thanks.</v>

533
00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:39.740
Hey.

534
00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:43.730
<v 6>Um,
so I think a lot of people I know,
different organizations and sites,</v>

535
00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:47.840
society where I'm encouraged to focus on our strengths and I think it's easier

536
00:31:47.841 --> 00:31:50.510
to make a jump if you're going from like a strength,
another strength.

537
00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:54.890
But in the case of like if you wanted to go from a to something that you were

538
00:31:54.891 --> 00:31:58.040
weaker,
like I'm thinking when you said you were,
um,

539
00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:02.480
when you jumped a squat to squash,
like it's not something that you are,
um,

540
00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:06.260
that you were strong at.
Just advice between the two,
the two different jumps,

541
00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:09.720
some dinette you're strong at and then something that you're weak at.
Yeah,
yeah.

542
00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:10.971
<v 1>There's a great,</v>

543
00:32:10.971 --> 00:32:14.300
there's a story in the book about a woman who was at linkedin and jumped

544
00:32:14.301 --> 00:32:18.020
internally from like a research role to sales and she really was not a

545
00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:21.770
salesperson,
has studied kind of hardcore analytics in school,

546
00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:25.130
but it always wanted to work with,
with people in the external side.

547
00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:27.230
And I think it's,
you know,

548
00:32:27.231 --> 00:32:30.920
it comes down again to being like who's doing the thing that I want to be doing

549
00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:34.700
and will they let me have like 30 minutes with them?

550
00:32:34.701 --> 00:32:39.200
Can I buy them a cup of coffee?
And just like going at that weakness until,

551
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:41.780
and this sounds cliche,
but until that becomes the thing that you've,

552
00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:45.320
you feel like you know better than your current job.
And I think the hard part,

553
00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:48.890
at least it was for me at bay and maybe for you guys at Google is once you get

554
00:32:48.891 --> 00:32:53.300
in that spot where you feel really like you know how everything works.
It almost,

555
00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:56.540
it's like a,
like an all or nothing thing.

556
00:32:56.541 --> 00:32:58.970
It's like I can't leave this cause then I won't know anything about the other

557
00:32:58.971 --> 00:33:02.930
thing.
And if you can kind of always be on that edge of your seat,

558
00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:06.200
even if you're doing like for eight hours a day the thing you're supposed to do.

559
00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:10.040
But at lunch you go take like a programming course or you talk to the person who

560
00:33:10.041 --> 00:33:12.740
is doing what you want.
Like that stuff.
I think if you,

561
00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:16.240
if you feel like it gets into a routine and it's like,
uh,

562
00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:19.190
there's a circularity to your day and your job,

563
00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:21.470
I think that's like a signal that you know,

564
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:23.930
you're coasting maybe a more than you,
you probably want to,

565
00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:28.190
but maybe that's what you need to like there's a spectrum of,

566
00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:32.300
I think the jump curve is like a spectrum.
If you've just,
you know,

567
00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:36.590
had a third child or you've got student debts to pay back or a mortgage,

568
00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:39.470
like I wouldn't say that you need to jump just then,

569
00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:42.290
but you can be having those chats of what you want to do.

570
00:33:42.291 --> 00:33:44.810
You can be planning and then at some point there will be an opportunity,

571
00:33:44.811 --> 00:33:48.410
I think to do it.
It just,
I mean no one in the book jumped the next day.

572
00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:52.070
It was like months,
if not some people waited two years,
five years to do it.

573
00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:56.810
So I know that wasn't exactly what you asked.
Now I think it's Oh,
sweet.

574
00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:03.050
Oh,
I think they need that though for the,

575
00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:08.870
<v 6>okay.
I'm curious to,
to know if,
uh,
well first of all,</v>

576
00:34:08.871 --> 00:34:12.830
thanks.
Thanks for firsthand.
You started very courageous and very inspiring.

577
00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:15.770
Um,
I'm curious to know whether,
uh,

578
00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:20.930
through the 44 stories that are in the book and perhaps the other stories that

579
00:34:20.931 --> 00:34:25.190
didn't make it,
did you find any common traits in,
in,

580
00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:29.330
in the personality of people?
Would you say?
You know,
eve,

581
00:34:29.331 --> 00:34:32.840
they have a couple of things come on.
You know,
people talk about the whole range,

582
00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:36.890
discipline,
visionary,
whatever.

583
00:34:37.490 --> 00:34:41.150
I wonder if you,
if you picked on any commonality across.

584
00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:42.671
<v 1>To be honest,</v>

585
00:34:42.671 --> 00:34:47.560
I think that my whole thesis with the book and what I feel like drives me to do

586
00:34:47.561 --> 00:34:50.740
this is that I think we,
we tend to just find like these,

587
00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:55.060
these buzzwords and we feel like we have to only give them to some people and

588
00:34:55.061 --> 00:34:57.460
then we feel like the other people just weren't born with those traits.

589
00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:02.050
And the whole point of this book and the community is that we celebrate like the

590
00:35:02.051 --> 00:35:06.130
person you walk by in the tube or going for coffee and their jump.

591
00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:10.780
And I actually think there's nothing that the people have in common except for

592
00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:14.170
this feeling that as you get a little bit more into thinking of what you want to

593
00:35:14.171 --> 00:35:18.730
do,
this equation starts to go on balanced where it goes from,

594
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.980
well it can be really bad if I did it.

595
00:35:20.981 --> 00:35:25.150
And it's not worth doing it to saying,
okay,
there's a,

596
00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:29.080
there's a worst case scenario of going and that's terrifying.

597
00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:32.920
But each of the people in the book would,
would show you in,
in their stories.

598
00:35:32.921 --> 00:35:37.921
You'll see that idea of not trying ultimately is way more terrifying.

599
00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:43.740
So I don't think there's like a special,
like,
you know,
super power.
Um,

600
00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:46.980
I think it's this realization of if you peel back the layers,

601
00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:50.580
at some point you're going to see this worst case scenario isn't as bad,

602
00:35:50.581 --> 00:35:52.170
especially if you're at a place like Google.

603
00:35:52.171 --> 00:35:55.540
And if you end up jumping outside of Google,
don't blame me.
Uh,

604
00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:58.680
you can if you want.
But I think that it,
it goes for anything.
Like,

605
00:35:58.681 --> 00:36:00.390
if you want to change jobs within the company,

606
00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:04.440
there's so much more at stake for them to keep you and find the right role for

607
00:36:04.441 --> 00:36:06.000
you.
And maybe if it doesn't work,

608
00:36:06.001 --> 00:36:10.410
find a different role than to go outside and take a chance on a stranger.

609
00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:13.950
Like just if you,
if you think of human resources and human capital,

610
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:15.840
like you guys made it into the circle,

611
00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:20.370
you should feel like you've got all the launching pad you have and all the risk

612
00:36:20.371 --> 00:36:24.010
opportunity to take cause you're already there.
Uh,

613
00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:27.240
so thank you.
And by the way,

614
00:36:27.241 --> 00:36:30.950
I wish I had a key card cause I would like if you're enjoying the meals,

615
00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:34.590
just keep going.
Cause I really wish that I had that these days.

616
00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:36.240
Maybe a 401k too.

617
00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:39.600
<v 7>Perfect.
Thank you.
My question was quite similar to that one,</v>

618
00:36:39.601 --> 00:36:42.570
but with a bit of a twist.
So,
um,
you've spoken quite a lot about,

619
00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:45.560
you've used the word risk quite a lot and um,

620
00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:48.960
obviously there's a lot of conversation about gender and men and women and the

621
00:36:48.961 --> 00:36:53.350
differences and I think kind of almost it probably over discussed,
but,
um,

622
00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:56.340
something that everyone's talking about Kelowna's that women are probably just

623
00:36:56.370 --> 00:37:00.870
less sort of inclined to take rest,
have more risk of us.
Um,

624
00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:02.640
doesn't sound like that played out,

625
00:37:02.641 --> 00:37:04.980
but did he see anything like that and kind of your research?

626
00:37:06.070 --> 00:37:07.600
<v 1>So the second story in the book,</v>

627
00:37:07.601 --> 00:37:10.480
the first story is about a karate school manager who want to be a screenwriter

628
00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:14.260
and failed a bunch of times and then tried one more time and ended up printing

629
00:37:14.261 --> 00:37:15.250
sleepless in Seattle.

630
00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:21.150
And then the second story is of a 44 year old woman and mother single mother who

631
00:37:21.251 --> 00:37:25.060
left her job as a nurse to become a doctor.

632
00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:27.250
And I think in her story,

633
00:37:27.251 --> 00:37:32.251
it definitely reflects the unique challenges that women face different than men

634
00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:34.880
in taking a jump.
Uh,

635
00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:37.660
she was told early on that she wasn't at a type of person that could go to

636
00:37:37.661 --> 00:37:39.070
college.
Um,

637
00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:42.760
she then had a child and had to care for the child and couldn't do both as a

638
00:37:42.761 --> 00:37:46.570
single parent.
Um,
so I think there are,
and I'm not the expert,

639
00:37:46.571 --> 00:37:49.750
I would say speak to the women who have jumped.
Um,

640
00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:53.980
but like from the data,
it's just seems like there are,

641
00:37:54.010 --> 00:37:57.670
there are obstacles,
not insurmountable ones,
but obstacles you have to feel like,

642
00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:03.190
okay,
I know I know what I'm going to have to overcome,
but I don't think it's as,

643
00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:08.050
again,
as literal and as tactically challenging as we may make it seem.

644
00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:10.210
And there's women in the book who,

645
00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:15.220
who jumped with kids who jumped going through a divorce,
who jumped,
uh,

646
00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:18.790
planning to have a family,
like things that you think would be kind of end all,

647
00:38:18.791 --> 00:38:22.330
be all stopping jumps,
um,
and they were able to do it.

648
00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:26.170
So there's a bunch more in the book of like how they went and did that.

649
00:38:26.171 --> 00:38:30.790
But I would say it's not as insurmountable as it may seem.
And our,

650
00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:33.980
our audience,
by the way,
in community members are more than,
uh,

651
00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:36.280
more than half are women who have jumped.
So

652
00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:42.490
I have a question.
How did you get the Olympians number?

653
00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:46.530
It's a great question.
No one's asked that.
Well I noticed.
No,

654
00:38:47.010 --> 00:38:50.260
no one's asked that ever.
Okay.
But yeah,
I'd like to know.

655
00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:55.750
I have a really funny side story to that too.
Um,
I feel like I should just tell.

656
00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:56.980
So,
um,

657
00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:01.390
she had went to a university and then I had a friend who knew a friend of hers

658
00:39:01.391 --> 00:39:04.570
cause they were,
she was five years ahead of me,
which is another,

659
00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:07.840
like the reason we're making this directory is it shouldn't be that difficult.

660
00:39:07.841 --> 00:39:09.560
And I was really lucky that I knew somebody,

661
00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:13.780
but she's someone who had taken anybody's call.
No one had asked her about that.

662
00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:17.050
When I got to the second baseman for the cubs,
he,
you can Google it.

663
00:39:17.051 --> 00:39:18.520
It just on a piece in the New Yorker,

664
00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:22.420
he had just done a piece in New York Times and I was living in Zimbabwe at the

665
00:39:22.421 --> 00:39:24.250
time.
Facebook messaging him.

666
00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:27.850
And you guys know when you're not a Facebook friend where those messages go.

667
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:32.320
Yeah.
To like the weird box.
Like no one should respond.
Like,
it's just not even,

668
00:39:32.321 --> 00:39:33.730
I don't think a thing.

669
00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:38.860
And I think I emailed him like six times to that inbox.
And finally he was like,

670
00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:42.220
I want to be able to tell the story of,
of when you shouldn't jump.

671
00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:45.490
Cause he had jumped at the wrong time and he had to go back to baseball and all

672
00:39:45.491 --> 00:39:50.050
these things,
um,
to,
uh,
to tell you the funny story.

673
00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:53.950
Um,
we,
uh,
like just,

674
00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:56.530
we started partnering with Soul Cycle,
which I know is in the states,
not here,

675
00:39:56.531 --> 00:39:57.940
but it's like the spinning whatever.

676
00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:01.300
And when I came back to the u s and we started working soul cycle,

677
00:40:01.301 --> 00:40:05.890
I tracked on the cyclist and I was like,
can we,
can we like,
you know,
hang out.

678
00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:08.170
And she was like,
yeah.
And I was like,

679
00:40:08.171 --> 00:40:11.080
I've mentioned in passing that we started partner with soul cycle.
She's like,
Oh,

680
00:40:11.081 --> 00:40:13.540
do you like I'd love to go.
I've never gone.
And I was like,

681
00:40:13.541 --> 00:40:15.100
this is like a sports center commercial.

682
00:40:15.101 --> 00:40:18.430
Like here's a woman who's a two time Olympian.
She just finished in Rio.

683
00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:20.910
And so we go in and,
uh,

684
00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:26.040
we had just done a talk with them at soul cycle and we go into this class and

685
00:40:26.681 --> 00:40:27.011
I'm like,

686
00:40:27.011 --> 00:40:30.040
next to the Olympia and she's fascinating her shoes that she had in Rio.

687
00:40:30.041 --> 00:40:33.130
And I'm like,
don't freak out my toe.
And the instructor's like,

688
00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:36.480
is Mike Lewis here?
And she's like,
is that you?
And I was like,
no,
no,
no.

689
00:40:36.490 --> 00:40:39.490
Don't worry about it.
I'm like,
not me.
And they're like,
no,
no,
no.

690
00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:43.660
We need to all give Mike Lewis a hand for coming in here because when did jump

691
00:40:43.661 --> 00:40:45.160
is going to change everyone's life.

692
00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:49.570
And everyone had to give me a random applause.
And she's like,
are you kidding me?

693
00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:56.110
Uh,
but she's become a friend.
So yeah.
First of all,
thank you for Google,
uh,

694
00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:57.910
to put the song.
If you can give a round of applause,

695
00:40:57.911 --> 00:41:02.620
I'd really pushing me to do this.
Um,
if I don't get to chat today,

696
00:41:02.621 --> 00:41:07.420
if you want to learn more,
like I said,
um,
Info when to jump.com,
we'll get to me.

697
00:41:07.810 --> 00:41:11.450
Uh,
we have the directory and we have the festival.
Abby's just ABB.

698
00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:15.040
Why at one to jump.
Um,
and I really hope this was helpful.

699
00:41:15.041 --> 00:41:18.070
I hope it's interesting.
Uh,
tell your friends,
and thanks so much for coming.
