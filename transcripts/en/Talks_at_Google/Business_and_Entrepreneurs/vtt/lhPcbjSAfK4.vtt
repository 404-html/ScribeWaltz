WEBVTT

1
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.190
First of all,
we just want to thank everyone for coming.

2
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.000
We're super excited to share our story with you all.
Um,

3
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.700
so thanks for taking the time.
Um,

4
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.080
w what we want to talk about today is I'm just sort of a history of night shift

5
00:00:19.081 --> 00:00:23.190
brewing through the lens of what we have just called create better.

6
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:24.503
Um,

7
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.100
we've sort of refined what our company stands for,
uh,

8
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.980
to the point of calling this a or calling it create better,

9
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.330
which has led us to sort of consistently improve our business.
Um,

10
00:00:36.331 --> 00:00:39.120
it's kind of about learning from our failures and we're just kind of hoping to

11
00:00:39.121 --> 00:00:41.030
walk through our history,
um,

12
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.830
with that lens in mind and just kind of talk through our story.

13
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.470
So a little bit about who we are.
Um,

14
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.550
we are the three founders of night shift brewing.
Uh,
I'm Michael,
this is Mike.

15
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.260
That's rob.
Um,
we collectively owned about 80% of the company,

16
00:00:55.261 --> 00:00:58.680
so we,
uh,
we're the board of directors.
We make the decisions,

17
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.790
we set the vision for it,
uh,
and we started it.

18
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.450
So we're actively involved day to day.
Um,

19
00:01:04.451 --> 00:01:07.990
and we're also driving sort of longterm vision.
Um,
I just want to note,

20
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.920
rob is also the president of the mass brewer's guild,

21
00:01:10.921 --> 00:01:14.850
which has been really impactful not just for our business but also for

22
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.390
businesses,
breweries in Massachusetts.
So that's been super exciting.

23
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.320
So first I want to talk about failure because our past is full of it and I think

24
00:01:24.541 --> 00:01:27.540
it's important context to set.
This is me.

25
00:01:27.541 --> 00:01:31.560
I think just transferring some beer back in 2013 and totally failing at it.

26
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.850
Um,
so I think it was important to note is,
you know,

27
00:01:35.851 --> 00:01:39.540
our failures are often some of the reasons we've been successful because we've

28
00:01:39.541 --> 00:01:44.100
had to learn from them.
Um,
and it's kind of forced us to make creative mistakes.

29
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.250
So I just wanted to walk through a few of them,
um,

30
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.750
and just kind of recap some of the things that we've screwed up over the years

31
00:01:51.751 --> 00:01:54.570
that have taught us some serious lessons.
First off,

32
00:01:54.571 --> 00:01:56.130
we just didn't have any professional experience.

33
00:01:56.131 --> 00:01:59.160
We made a lot of mistakes because we weren't in the industry,
uh,

34
00:01:59.161 --> 00:02:01.850
beforehand we were just home brewers.
Um,
I,

35
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.860
I do think having that perspective kind of gave us this fresh set of eyes on the

36
00:02:06.901 --> 00:02:09.630
industry and sometimes I think we made more creative decisions,

37
00:02:09.631 --> 00:02:14.310
but also a lot of mistakes.
Um,
you know,
at,
at times,

38
00:02:14.311 --> 00:02:19.050
especially in the early years,
the quality of our beer was sometimes iffy.

39
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.880
Uh,
it was good enough definitely to get us where we are.
But,
um,

40
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.360
you know,
we did have corks that would pop out of bottles,
bottles,
that would,

41
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.213
gosh,

42
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.470
there's a video on youtube of a guy opening a bottle of our beer and it like

43
00:02:31.471 --> 00:02:36.000
explodes everywhere.
Um,
which we play at staff parties.
Um,

44
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.360
and we've drained a lot of beer.
Uh,

45
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.210
we won't put out beer that's no good or that's good or that's no good.
Um,

46
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.130
and it's,
uh,
it's forced us to develop a much better lab,
better equipment.

47
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.670
And we learned a lot through,
um,
you know,
initially having some,
if you be here,

48
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.580
um,
inventory and freshness issues were,
uh,

49
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.100
definitely things we have struggled with or at least struggle with in the past.

50
00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.280
Um,
as you grow,
you know,

51
00:03:00.281 --> 00:03:03.520
you have more and more beer and you have to figure out how to store it and how

52
00:03:03.521 --> 00:03:04.970
to keep track of it.
Um,

53
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.160
so we've had to learn ways to sort of deal with that and develop cold storage

54
00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:13.210
and a better processes for managing all of our beer.
Um,

55
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.490
especially early.
We barely make payroll a lot and it was really scary.

56
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:19.503
Um,

57
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.900
but that forced us to create a more fiscally responsible approaches,
uh,

58
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.420
to our budget,
uh,
and have a better control of our balance sheet.

59
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.480
Um,
when we started it was just the three of us and we didn't really have a staff

60
00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:37.360
development plan cause we were worried about developing anyone other than

61
00:03:37.361 --> 00:03:38.550
ourselves.
Um,

62
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.130
we're now at 126 people and that has forced us to think about,

63
00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:48.640
you know,
how we're developing people and their future is not just our own.
Um,

64
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.200
and we most recently hired an HR director,
which was super exciting.
Um,

65
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.230
and then just finally,
uh,
you know,

66
00:03:54.231 --> 00:03:56.500
under planned over budget and abandoned projects,
you know,

67
00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.970
you've got plenty of those behind us.
Um,
but I,

68
00:03:58.971 --> 00:04:00.760
I think what's important to note there is,
you know,

69
00:04:00.761 --> 00:04:04.390
we just learned to ask better questions to put better projects in front of us.

70
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.220
Um,
all right,
so why are we hope you're going to listen to us anyway.
Um,

71
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.810
we're a passion driven business.

72
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.230
We started with a really strong passion and I think we still have that today.

73
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.310
It's what drives us to,
you know,
wake up everyday and do what we do.
Um,

74
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.700
we're still very independent,
you know,
we own collectively 80% of the company.

75
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.310
The rest is friends and family.
Um,

76
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.340
we've been profitable every year since we started 150 times volume growth since

77
00:04:29.711 --> 00:04:32.640
the very beginning.
Um,
I,
you know,

78
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.700
it's been amazing to see and we don't even think about it very often.

79
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.960
We just kind of keep going.
But,
um,
we do,

80
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.250
we sort of do have that behind us and it's been awesome.
Um,
like I said,

81
00:04:42.251 --> 00:04:46.600
we employ 126 people.
We try and offer them great perks.
Um,

82
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.620
we started with this approach of,
you know,
going deep,
not wide,
and we,

83
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.810
we still have maintained that,
um,
in our market,
uh,

84
00:04:52.811 --> 00:04:56.560
we are just in Massachusetts when we started and we're mostly still in

85
00:04:56.561 --> 00:05:00.070
Massachusetts today.
Uh,
just a little bit out of state.
Uh,

86
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.750
we still have strong sales and velocity and as we're going to talk about today,

87
00:05:04.751 --> 00:05:06.940
we're on a mission to shift our industry and create better.

88
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.790
So a little a visual history of night shift through the lens of create better,

89
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.720
um,
five years of homebrew behind us.
We started in 2012.
Uh,

90
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.930
we had 150 capital raised between friends and family,
three staff,

91
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.910
1500 square feet and Everett,

92
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.080
I'm in this small dingy little construction space.
Um,

93
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:34.000
and that we turned into a brewery and a lots of passion,
lots more ignorance.
Um,

94
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.720
this photo was taken at 4:36 AM at the end of a really long brew day.

95
00:05:37.721 --> 00:05:40.300
That was our first day ever brewing.
Um,

96
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.540
so it's just like one of those moments we've captured first day Berean

97
00:05:43.541 --> 00:05:46.690
commercially,
first day ruined commercially.
Yes,
true.

98
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.910
And here's a day a brewing,
um,
as homebrewers.

99
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.410
So this isn't our Somerville Kitchen.
Um,

100
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.320
three of us just standing there looking like muppets.
And,
um,

101
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.000
then we turned pro and that shot was taken,
uh,
for the improper Bostonian.
Uh,

102
00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:02.900
in 2012.

103
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:09.440
This is our brewery back in 2012.
This is like a clean day for us.

104
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.270
Um,
yeah,
so I just want to talk through a few of the,

105
00:06:14.271 --> 00:06:16.490
uh,
the things that we focused on,
uh,

106
00:06:16.491 --> 00:06:18.170
to sort of create better when we were beginning.

107
00:06:18.171 --> 00:06:20.960
And then I'll hand it off to these guys to walk us through the rest of the
years.

108
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.220
We started with all cork and cage bottles.
We hand labeled them,

109
00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.860
we hand wrote on them.
We were really going for like a very premium look.

110
00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.700
We were trying to stand out in the marketplace,
um,

111
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.890
elevate beer to sort of like a wine like status.
Uh,

112
00:06:33.891 --> 00:06:38.840
it gave us higher margins and um,
I think it did help us stand out.
Um,

113
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.990
and it,
you know,
a personal touch like writing on every single label.

114
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:46.460
It was a huge pain,
but like people I think appreciated it.
Um,

115
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.770
and eventually we moved away from that into cans,
which we'll get to fairly soon.

116
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:55.760
Uh,
but it was an interesting way to start because it was this create better

117
00:06:55.761 --> 00:06:59.780
mentality.
Um,
I also just want to know what we started with volunteers.

118
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.260
Some of those guys in the picture,
there were just volunteers helping us.
Um,

119
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:05.900
none of them we employ any more,

120
00:07:05.901 --> 00:07:08.780
but we did hire a bunch of our volunteers from the beginning.
Uh,

121
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:11.930
and that's just been like super rewarding to be able to take people that were

122
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.800
volunteering and just lending their time to us and bringing them on and sort of

123
00:07:15.801 --> 00:07:19.010
help grow the company with them together.
So the other,

124
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.620
I would say like big thing that helped us stand out in the beginning,

125
00:07:21.621 --> 00:07:23.180
it was a hundred percent shifted beers.

126
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:27.320
It was like nothing can go in a bottle unless it's shifted.
Um,

127
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.500
we even said we will never be an IPA.
That's a thing.
Um,

128
00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:36.700
which is so weird because now like our focus is really like hoppy beers.
Um,

129
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.910
but in the beginning it was all shifted.
A Viva Habanero was a,

130
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:42.740
the Riaa with Habanero peppers.

131
00:07:42.741 --> 00:07:46.640
That was sort of one of our trademark flagship core beers in the beginning.

132
00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:49.100
Um,
it got us attention.

133
00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:53.360
It really established us as an innovation brand.
Um,

134
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:57.710
ultimately was unsuccessful just because we decided to switch to more drinkable

135
00:07:57.711 --> 00:08:01.160
beers,
hoppy,
hoppy beers,
uh,

136
00:08:01.161 --> 00:08:05.720
that encouraged more repeat purchases.
Um,
genius.
It's genius,

137
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:07.243
it's brilliant,

138
00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:11.960
but it was a great way to get our name out there and spread the word just to our

139
00:08:11.961 --> 00:08:16.820
barrel aging program that we started with.
Um,
it's still alive to this day.
Um,

140
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.450
it,
it was sort of an extension of our shifted approach.
Um,
I mean,

141
00:08:20.451 --> 00:08:24.750
we still produce every Weiss shifted is basically a no traditional,
not,

142
00:08:24.751 --> 00:08:29.420
not just traditional ingredients of water,
malts,
hops and yeast.
So,

143
00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:33.230
um,
anything else that we could think of like cinnamon sticks,
fruit,

144
00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:37.460
Habanero peppers.
We've got weirder than that,
but yeah,
you know,

145
00:08:37.461 --> 00:08:40.510
every is a beard that actually stuck around and we started with it.
Um,

146
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:44.930
and that one's grown into sort of a core offering of ours.
Um,

147
00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.840
and I think,
you know,
trying to do barrel aged sour beers,

148
00:08:47.841 --> 00:08:51.410
again forced us to sort of learn about interesting processes that are really

149
00:08:51.411 --> 00:08:55.290
complex and we made a ton of mistakes along the way and now we can,
you know,

150
00:08:55.300 --> 00:09:00.300
put out this,
this awesome sour program.
Um,
that's grown with us.
Uh,

151
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:05.400
we started with plastic for mentors,
um,
who was not a good idea,

152
00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:10.080
uh,
looking back,
but it was cheap and we didn't have a lot of money so,

153
00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.910
uh,
it's so like shameful to say it,
but we had like a,

154
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:19.150
like a normal ale room which was just conditioned with a air conditioner and

155
00:09:19.531 --> 00:09:22.650
then like a sour stays on room,
which was just a space heater.

156
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:26.730
And that's how we like controlled temperature,
um,

157
00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.900
which is not recommended at all,
but we made it work.
Uh,

158
00:09:30.901 --> 00:09:35.700
and you know,
the beer quality was good enough to get us out there.
Uh,

159
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:39.160
we did ultimately make the decision to move to stainless steel,
uh,

160
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.970
when we could afford it.
Um,
and you know,

161
00:09:41.971 --> 00:09:44.490
that that allowed us to really expand our style offerings.

162
00:09:44.491 --> 00:09:47.580
It actually allowed us to really get into hoppy beers,
uh,

163
00:09:47.581 --> 00:09:49.530
improve our quality a lot,
uh,

164
00:09:49.531 --> 00:09:51.630
and set the direction for the future of the company.

165
00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:55.500
One of the core decisions I think we made in the beginning was to not sign with

166
00:09:55.501 --> 00:10:00.210
a distributor and just do it all ourselves.
Uh,
we'll get to it a lot more later.

167
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.650
But,
uh,
at that time,
you know,

168
00:10:01.651 --> 00:10:05.390
we were just looking at the distributor partners out there.
We didn't see,
um,

169
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.220
anyone that we wanted to work with and a massive franchise law basically locks

170
00:10:10.221 --> 00:10:13.860
you in a contract for life.
So we didn't want to do that.

171
00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:18.030
And so we said,
we'll just throw beer in a Subaru,
drop it off,

172
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:23.430
and uh,
handle all the sales ourselves.
Um,
it allowed us to keep 30% margin,

173
00:10:23.431 --> 00:10:27.210
which is,
which was good for profitability,
but probably more importantly,

174
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:31.190
it allowed us to develop really deep relationships with all of our accounts,
um,

175
00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:34.800
and get to know what our customer's needs were and like here on a regular basis.

176
00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.470
Um,
and what's happening in the market.
Uh,

177
00:10:37.471 --> 00:10:40.920
our tasting room was not a part of the business plan really.
Um,

178
00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:45.090
and it's become core to who we are today.
Um,

179
00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:48.150
we started with 90 square feet.
Uh,
we thought,
you know,

180
00:10:48.151 --> 00:10:49.290
some people will drop in here,

181
00:10:49.291 --> 00:10:52.930
probably not very often because we're in a sketchy warehouse.
Um,

182
00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:57.600
but if they want to come in,
cool.
And,
uh,
we'll sample them on some beers.
Um,

183
00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:01.560
as our reputation grew,
we just got busier and busier.

184
00:11:01.561 --> 00:11:03.950
We expanded our hours.
I think we were just,
um,

185
00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:07.640
is it Thursdays and Saturdays to start?
And it,
you know,

186
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.500
open everyday of the week was soon a thing.
Um,

187
00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:12.390
we've expanded into our production space,

188
00:11:12.391 --> 00:11:14.370
which was like dangerous and not a good idea.

189
00:11:14.371 --> 00:11:18.570
But when you have people like waiting out the door,
what are you going to do?
Um,

190
00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:21.960
and then,
uh,
we ultimately learned like,
okay,
when we move,

191
00:11:21.961 --> 00:11:25.070
which we know we have to do,
we have to build a bigger tap room,
uh,

192
00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:28.710
because this is more important than a 90 square foot space.

193
00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.570
And then the last thing I want to talk about is just a,

194
00:11:31.571 --> 00:11:34.050
the decision to put the owl everywhere.
Um,

195
00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:38.910
I actually drew our logo back in 2010 when we were just home brewing and it was

196
00:11:38.911 --> 00:11:40.750
just something to slap on bottles,
uh,

197
00:11:40.751 --> 00:11:44.160
as like our homebrew labels and give it to friends.
Um,

198
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:47.520
and when we made the business it was just like,
oh,
this is our logo.
Cool.

199
00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:50.910
We decided to be a logo oriented company.
Um,

200
00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:56.090
not a lot of breweries were doing that and we decided like that's going to be

201
00:11:56.141 --> 00:11:57.360
what's everywhere.
Um,

202
00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:02.200
it's a hop and an hour at the same time and it's kind of nocturnal creature.

203
00:12:02.201 --> 00:12:05.440
So it felt like it made sense.
Um,
and we've really,

204
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.240
we've grown with that and we've just made that a bigger,

205
00:12:08.241 --> 00:12:09.400
a bigger part of our branding.

206
00:12:09.401 --> 00:12:13.540
And I think that's been a huge part of sort of how we've grown and created

207
00:12:13.541 --> 00:12:18.541
messaging around our logo in the l transitioning from our early,

208
00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:19.121
early,

209
00:12:19.121 --> 00:12:23.890
early years in 2012 2013 to 2014 and 15 I'll pass it over to Mike.

210
00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:29.910
<v 2>So the next couple of years,
um,
was a kind of a big transition for us.
Um,</v>

211
00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:33.850
we moved to a new brewery as Michael alluded to.

212
00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:39.300
We went from 700 barrels and 2013 to over 4,000 barrels by the end of 2015,

213
00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:45.400
kind of had a renewed focus on quality of all their branding and you know,

214
00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:47.980
I went through a few expansion projects along the way that,
you know,

215
00:12:47.981 --> 00:12:51.970
themselves had a couple of rough patches that we learned from.
Um,
and then,

216
00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:56.680
you know,
really continue to establish our,
our strong local presence.

217
00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:01.900
And following in 2014,
you know,
we expanded our tap room.
That was a new thing.

218
00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:04.390
It wasn't in our business plan to begin with.
Um,

219
00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:08.800
kind of through that business plan out like,
okay,
we're focusing on the tap room.

220
00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:12.580
It's going to be an awesome place for people to come and hang out instead of

221
00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:17.320
coming to a dingy,
creepy warehouse that didn't have true working bathrooms.

222
00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:21.160
Um,
so this was a very nice upgrade.
Real bathrooms included.

223
00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:22.693
<v 3>Okay.</v>

224
00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:26.810
<v 2>Um,
just kind of a side by side.
Our original brewery,</v>

225
00:13:26.811 --> 00:13:31.130
which is about 60 gallons per kettle there,
um,
to our new brewery,

226
00:13:31.131 --> 00:13:35.330
which required steps to get up to and about 600 barrels per batch.
Um,

227
00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:38.660
so a pretty sizable increase in production size there.

228
00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:46.540
And then,
yeah,
there's a couple of a picture of our labs.
So,
you know,

229
00:13:46.541 --> 00:13:49.060
we also invested a lot in quality because you know,

230
00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:53.140
if we're dumping beer that isn't good enough to go out to the market,
um,

231
00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:57.310
which is good for our reputation but bad for our bottom line.

232
00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:01.150
So we had to do something about that in order to continue making world class

233
00:14:01.151 --> 00:14:05.270
beer.
We invested heavily in our lab and equipment and people to run it,
um,

234
00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:08.570
to make sure that,
you know,
everything from,
you know,

235
00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:12.010
the day we're brewing it to the time we practice packaging it is,
you know,

236
00:14:12.011 --> 00:14:15.820
analyze along the line and made sure it's quality and we're going to be able to

237
00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.120
ship what we make and be really proud of it at the same time.

238
00:14:19.121 --> 00:14:23.650
So increasing the quality,
consistent consistency there is,

239
00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:27.730
was pretty key.
In addition to that,
you know,
transitioning to cans,
um,

240
00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:31.000
it's kind of two parts there.
One was,
you know,

241
00:14:31.001 --> 00:14:35.050
cans are better for the beer,
they don't let light in.
Um,

242
00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:39.250
they don't let as much oxygen in a,
so it increases the shelf stability.

243
00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:42.190
So that increases the quality of,
of the Br just,

244
00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:43.750
just in the package format change.

245
00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:49.050
We kind of saw early on at the craft beer market was shifting away from bottles,

246
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:54.020
which goes totally against what we were trying to do with the cork and cage.
But,

247
00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:59.150
um,
that's what people started to buy.
And we latched onto that very early on.
Um,

248
00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:02.360
and you know,
as soon as we did,
we noticed velocity increase.

249
00:15:02.361 --> 00:15:06.890
It increased tremendously.
Uh,
and we think a big part of that was,

250
00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:07.851
you know,

251
00:15:07.851 --> 00:15:12.851
it's Kinda hard to sit down for a night and commit to 25 ounces of,

252
00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:13.540
you know,

253
00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:18.450
a 7% beer where it's much easier to snap a can off of a four pack and,
you know,

254
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:22.640
drink 16 ounces of it and then maybe drink the rest of the four pack if you
want.

255
00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:26.240
But,
but you have options.

256
00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:31.340
And then along with the cans,
uh,
it was an opportunity to kind of,
you know,

257
00:15:31.341 --> 00:15:33.380
reinvision the branding.
Um,

258
00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.860
and originally with our logo we kind of had the owl and night shift brewing,

259
00:15:36.861 --> 00:15:39.130
all kind of squished together with a box.
Um,

260
00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:43.760
and this offered an opportunity for us to revisit that and really focus on the

261
00:15:43.761 --> 00:15:46.160
owl.
The owl is going to be everywhere to begin with.
So was like,

262
00:15:46.161 --> 00:15:48.780
why not just make that the prominent thing on the can that they,

263
00:15:48.781 --> 00:15:50.780
al is pretty cool and recognizable.

264
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:53.970
So we did that and we started with a whirlpool can with,
you know,

265
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:57.080
just the silver can,
which looks pretty cool and the Morph Canada,

266
00:15:57.090 --> 00:16:00.530
then you can see it evolved into a more playful thing with St Chilean whirlpool.

267
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:01.431
And along with that,

268
00:16:01.431 --> 00:16:05.930
we shifted away from doing our shifted beers with weird ingredients only.

269
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:08.030
And our,
uh,

270
00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:13.330
no IPA philosophy to doing IPA is and Pale Ales and Centralia whirlpool has

271
00:16:13.611 --> 00:16:15.020
become our two best selling beers.

272
00:16:15.021 --> 00:16:19.490
So we're not afraid to like change our mindset and get stuck in our ways,

273
00:16:19.491 --> 00:16:23.560
so to speak.
Um,
and a really awesome example of RPA,
uh,

274
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:28.280
evolution is more of,
um,
it was kind of born out of necessity.

275
00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:28.850
Uh,

276
00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:33.850
we weren't very good at hopcat hop contracting or forecasting what we were going

277
00:16:34.071 --> 00:16:35.780
to sell in the future.
Um,

278
00:16:35.781 --> 00:16:39.710
so we kind of took what we got and morph was a way to do that and we had a

279
00:16:39.711 --> 00:16:43.400
consistent brand but each batch was different from each firm itself.

280
00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:45.290
So we saw an opportunity in that.
It's like,

281
00:16:45.291 --> 00:16:48.320
well we can kind of use this as a test market cause we didn't have a flagship

282
00:16:48.321 --> 00:16:53.300
IPA at the time and we would analyze sales data in the tap room and collect

283
00:16:53.301 --> 00:16:56.540
feedback directly from customers in the tap room.
And you know,

284
00:16:56.541 --> 00:17:01.250
we use that to uh,
turn morph into our flagship IPA,

285
00:17:01.251 --> 00:17:05.690
which is San Tilly.
So we kind of secretly crowd sourced our flagship Ipa.

286
00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:06.860
Um,

287
00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:10.460
and then in 2016 we entered that into the world beer cup and it ended up winning

288
00:17:10.461 --> 00:17:14.930
bronze,
which is pretty awesome validation for that process there.

289
00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:19.580
Continue the evolution towards quality and,
and making things happen.

290
00:17:19.581 --> 00:17:23.390
We go from a keg seat belted into the back of the Subaru.

291
00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:28.820
That's my Subaru.
I still drive.
I drove it here today.
Yeah.
Smells like beer.

292
00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:32.240
Yeah.
Constantly smells like beer.
It's not never going away.

293
00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:34.820
And we upgraded to a sprinter van,
um,
you know,

294
00:17:34.821 --> 00:17:38.330
which helped us increase the amount of beer we could drop per per account,
which,

295
00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:41.940
you know,
increased efficiency.
Um,
and then,
you know,

296
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:43.700
finally now we have a fleet of,

297
00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:46.370
while we still kind of have a fleet of Subaru's floating around,

298
00:17:46.371 --> 00:17:48.520
but we don't deliver beer in him anymore.

299
00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:50.460
Now we have a fleet of refrigerated box trucks.

300
00:17:50.461 --> 00:17:54.090
So everything is cold from the time we package it to the time we deliver it and

301
00:17:54.091 --> 00:17:56.640
put it on the shelf.
Um,
you know,

302
00:17:56.641 --> 00:17:59.550
just kind of focusing on efficiencies and qualities and making sure that the

303
00:17:59.551 --> 00:18:04.230
beer is the best it can be.
And then in 2016 and 2017,

304
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:08.160
you know,
new equipment,
of course brewery expansion is happening,

305
00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:13.140
a taproom expansions and continuing to add people.
I'm here.

306
00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:15.870
We've got our taproom expansion,
so this is a,

307
00:18:15.871 --> 00:18:20.170
a new room and ended up making this really cool event space,
um,

308
00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:22.850
with the tap room and what we call the annex.
Um,

309
00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:25.490
which ended up being like an event space for us.
Uh,

310
00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.800
continue to add new equipment,
new canning line,
our own canning line.

311
00:18:28.801 --> 00:18:30.900
We were using mobile canner.
Again,

312
00:18:30.901 --> 00:18:34.710
we could focus and do our own quality control on that Katie Lane and not have to

313
00:18:34.711 --> 00:18:38.130
rely on somebody else,
more capacity with bigger tanks,

314
00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:41.610
more efficiencies with more equipment outside grain silos.

315
00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:45.390
We could order it by the truckload instead of by the pallet.
Um,

316
00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:51.540
and you know,
it's always awesome to get validation.
You know,

317
00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:55.230
we always thought we had it.
Um,
we always thought we had great culture,

318
00:18:55.231 --> 00:18:58.600
we had quality beer,
a great beer,
people liked it.
Um,

319
00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:03.650
but to enter these contests and win awards and look at our Yelp reviews,

320
00:19:03.901 --> 00:19:07.410
it's,
it's always good to see that.
And Google reviews.
Yeah.

321
00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:11.340
The best one.
Yeah,
of course.

322
00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:15.990
It's always good to have that kind of like different perspective and outside in,

323
00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:20.260
um,
validation of that.
Okay.
Yeah.
Maybe,
maybe we are doing something right.
Um,

324
00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:23.130
that feels good.
Let's continue to try to try to do something cool.

325
00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:27.320
And along the way we've had to hire more people.
So,
you know,

326
00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:30.240
we had about 65 employees at the end of 2017.

327
00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:34.770
I think we mentioned we have 126 now.
Um,
yeah,
we've had to,

328
00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:38.190
we had struggles,
but we've gotten smarter about how we keep the culture.

329
00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:42.420
We got smarter about how we hire people.
We invested in a program that helps us,

330
00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:46.300
uh,
you know,
looking at people's personalities to make sure that the right fit,

331
00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.000
get the right people in the right role,

332
00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:53.220
right people in the right seat of the bus so to speak.
So yeah,
we've gotten,

333
00:19:53.221 --> 00:19:56.880
we've gotten smarter at,
at hiring people over over the years,

334
00:19:57.130 --> 00:19:58.430
continued to add great people,

335
00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:02.130
the team and keep them around with what we provide them with culture and

336
00:20:02.131 --> 00:20:06.540
benefits and whatnot.
During that time,
we also started a distributor ship,

337
00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.250
so I'm going to let rob take that away.

338
00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:11.250
<v 4>Sure.
So in,
uh,
October,
2016,</v>

339
00:20:11.251 --> 00:20:14.530
we launched our own distribution company where we were running out of space in

340
00:20:14.531 --> 00:20:15.200
Everett and,

341
00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.870
and we needed a new warehouse and we've been doing it for ourselves and we

342
00:20:18.871 --> 00:20:20.770
thought we were kind of good at it.
So,
um,

343
00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:23.700
we were hearing from a lot of other breweries that they were frustrated with the

344
00:20:23.701 --> 00:20:26.160
same options that we were faced at one point.

345
00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.920
And a key tenant to our distribution company was,

346
00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:33.060
even though franchise law exist in the state today,
that we wouldn't hold,
um,

347
00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:36.450
fellow likeminded brewers to that if things weren't working out.

348
00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:40.470
We'll take it professionally and we can part ways and it will be better for both

349
00:20:40.471 --> 00:20:45.420
sides of the part of the fence.
NST has grown significantly over the last year.

350
00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:48.220
Uh,
we started the year with 600 accounts.

351
00:20:48.221 --> 00:20:53.170
We now have 1600 accounts that we serve is,
we pretty much go from Springfield,

352
00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:56.560
uh,
east Hampton Amhurst area all the way out to Martha's vineyard.

353
00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.330
Now we've really,

354
00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:02.890
really added a lot of capabilities to our logistics side of our operation.

355
00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:07.060
And not only that,
when we started the distribution company,
we,
we were beer guys,

356
00:21:07.061 --> 00:21:09.040
so let's only sell beer,
um,

357
00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:13.390
which we sell 18 different breweries now will this year we also added on wine

358
00:21:13.391 --> 00:21:18.391
and spirits as well as non alcoholic beverages like cold brew and teas and

359
00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:22.390
things like that.
And we just recently also got our import license.

360
00:21:22.391 --> 00:21:26.200
So one of the things we're going to tackle in 2019 and started importing alcohol

361
00:21:26.201 --> 00:21:29.760
from,
from Europe,
starting with some wines from France.
Um,

362
00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:33.850
but all under the same lens of let's look for small likeminded producers who are

363
00:21:33.851 --> 00:21:35.410
doing something a little bit different,

364
00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:40.150
who have either innovative packaging or cool cool products that are small batch

365
00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:42.640
that that we can really take a hold of and represent.

366
00:21:42.641 --> 00:21:47.641
Well we set out to sell beer for other people and we want to make sure we are

367
00:21:47.741 --> 00:21:49.270
good at it.
We didn't want to,
you know,

368
00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:52.630
make a false promise to these other breweries because they are small people like

369
00:21:52.631 --> 00:21:54.850
us that that put their heart and soul into their businesses.

370
00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:59.500
This is a presentation from one of our key suppliers to steal their brewery out

371
00:21:59.501 --> 00:22:03.910
in normal Illinois.
I visited is very normal.
Um,

372
00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:06.940
they make great sour beers in cans.
Uh,

373
00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:10.870
and we are actually their number one distributor along the East Coast from Maine

374
00:22:10.871 --> 00:22:14.650
to Florida.
We are,
we are their best supplier that moved the most volume.

375
00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.280
This is just a fun little slide that we,

376
00:22:16.281 --> 00:22:20.050
we've put together once a kind of show that we want to be more than just a beer

377
00:22:20.051 --> 00:22:20.411
company,

378
00:22:20.411 --> 00:22:23.710
that we want to be a beverage company and then anytime of the day we're selling

379
00:22:23.711 --> 00:22:27.860
something that's awesome.
Uh,
most of these are all low.

380
00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:31.450
The first three non are all locally owned Massachusetts businesses,

381
00:22:31.451 --> 00:22:35.050
which is pretty cool.
And then on the brewing side,
we continue to innovate.

382
00:22:35.051 --> 00:22:38.280
This uh,
beer came to life.
We're pointed today as well.
Uh,

383
00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:42.530
I came to life kind of back in 2016 when the brewers after a hot day of brewing,

384
00:22:42.531 --> 00:22:45.520
wanted something light and refreshing to drink and they were drinking like

385
00:22:45.521 --> 00:22:48.590
Miller high life and stuff.
And it was like eventually we were like,
what,
what,

386
00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.430
how are we drinking other people's beer when we have all the equipment to make

387
00:22:51.431 --> 00:22:55.480
that beer?
Um,
and we can probably do it better.
So let's do it for ourselves.

388
00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:57.570
And that's what we did.
Um,

389
00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:01.750
and we did it for a couple of times over the year and a half period,

390
00:23:01.751 --> 00:23:04.540
and then we started testing in the market and people are actually responding to

391
00:23:04.541 --> 00:23:08.040
it.
So we decided with that combined with the,

392
00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.410
the feeling that we are getting tired of going out into the market and taking

393
00:23:11.411 --> 00:23:14.050
down breweries,
IPA,
draft lines,

394
00:23:14.051 --> 00:23:17.230
and those are breweries that we like to hang out with that we share similar

395
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:20.710
problems or challenges and successes with.
It was like,

396
00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:24.010
I love the guys at Jack's Abby.
Why am I taking down their draft line?

397
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:25.880
Let's go after the guys,
uh,

398
00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:29.470
that we don't like and let's go after the biggest guys.
Uh,

399
00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:32.920
and we're sort of using the term macro nuisance now.
Uh,

400
00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:37.120
and it's also important to say that the light beer category is the largest

401
00:23:37.121 --> 00:23:40.360
category in beer.
And it's one that for whatever reason,

402
00:23:40.361 --> 00:23:43.720
craft brewers decided that they didn't want to play in that that was anti craft.

403
00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:49.080
And so we sort of fenced off the biggest part of the pool and let the biggest

404
00:23:49.191 --> 00:23:52.880
people when in it.
So why not?
Why not try to be the smallest guy taking,

405
00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:57.620
taking share.
We continue to also change our packaging options.

406
00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:00.950
These beers used to be in 750 milliliter champagne bottles.

407
00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:02.930
We talked about these earlier.

408
00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:05.960
These are sour beers that are fermented with bacteria.
Uh,

409
00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:10.340
we got a separate county lines so that we could put the beer live bacteria into

410
00:24:10.341 --> 00:24:11.780
the finished goods.

411
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:15.440
That's something atypical of what a lot of the sour beers that are out there in

412
00:24:15.441 --> 00:24:17.210
the market.
Those are usually kettle sours,

413
00:24:17.211 --> 00:24:19.880
which they kind of cook it to kind of almost pasteurize the product.

414
00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:22.490
These are living beers.
Um,

415
00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:26.480
and we also kind of tried to play around with the innovative labeling and we use

416
00:24:26.481 --> 00:24:29.750
really cool photography techniques to kind of showcase and they look very

417
00:24:29.751 --> 00:24:32.480
different from our,
our core lineup.
This summer,

418
00:24:32.481 --> 00:24:35.060
we also opened up to beer gardens along the esplanade that were,

419
00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:38.210
that were pretty fun place.
We have a patio in Everett,

420
00:24:38.211 --> 00:24:38.991
I don't know if he ever been,

421
00:24:38.991 --> 00:24:41.810
but it is basically you're sitting on crappy asphalt,
uh,

422
00:24:41.811 --> 00:24:45.320
in an industrial park and it's not very scenic spot.

423
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:49.190
So we set out to find the best spot in Boston to drink and we worked really hard

424
00:24:49.191 --> 00:24:52.220
to get this location.
Uh,
it was a wild success.

425
00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:55.910
One of the cool things that we did here too was we could be the most profitable

426
00:24:55.911 --> 00:25:00.080
if we only sold nightshift beer here,
but we,
that wasn't who we are.
Uh,

427
00:25:00.081 --> 00:25:00.800
we want to,

428
00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:04.700
we called it the owl's nest and it was a celebration of night shift Bruin and

429
00:25:04.701 --> 00:25:08.150
our friends.
And so we poured a lot of other people's beer here,
uh,

430
00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:11.330
that we made lower margins on,
but it was important to us.

431
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:13.390
This is just a fun little slide of kind of our,

432
00:25:13.391 --> 00:25:17.060
our barrel edge production over the last seven years,
uh,

433
00:25:17.061 --> 00:25:19.740
and kind of showcases our rapid growth.
Uh,

434
00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:22.040
we started with 200 barrels in our first year this year.

435
00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:25.400
We'll do a little over 30,000.
Our business plan had that.

436
00:25:25.401 --> 00:25:28.730
If we did 10,000 barrels in 10 years,
we'd be wildly successful and we'd,

437
00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:33.340
we'd probably call it quits.
Uh,
now we don't know where this,
where the,

438
00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:35.480
where the limit is and how far will it go.

439
00:25:35.481 --> 00:25:39.620
But I think one important thing is we've always set out to brew to demand not to

440
00:25:39.621 --> 00:25:40.251
hit a number.

441
00:25:40.251 --> 00:25:44.300
We're not beholding to a VC or private equity where we need to hit certain

442
00:25:44.301 --> 00:25:46.270
targets were brewing,
um,

443
00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:49.880
really slightly behind demand so that we can always have the best product on the

444
00:25:49.881 --> 00:25:54.560
shelf.
Um,
and we're not chasing anything that's not real.
I think,
you know,

445
00:25:54.561 --> 00:25:55.600
all this is,
you know,

446
00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:59.420
kind of inside feedback on to how we thought we were creating better.

447
00:25:59.421 --> 00:26:01.070
But I think the real proof is,

448
00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:05.030
will customers recognize that and open up their wallets and pay for the product?

449
00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.220
These numbers are Iri data,

450
00:26:07.221 --> 00:26:11.480
which is a syndicated data that's from cash registers.
Stales.
Uh,
this is,

451
00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:14.310
these are all from mass liquor stores.
Um,

452
00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:18.230
one thing that we did to get smarter was actually by data.
Instead of a guests.

453
00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:21.500
So this isn't our internal sales numbers.
Uh,

454
00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:25.790
this is actually what people are ringing up at cash registers and it's not every

455
00:26:25.791 --> 00:26:27.170
single transaction that happens,

456
00:26:27.171 --> 00:26:30.780
but it is indicative of what has happened out in the world.
Um,

457
00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:34.040
and we set out to make,
once we decided to make hoppy beer,

458
00:26:34.041 --> 00:26:35.570
we set out to make the best hoppy beer.

459
00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:39.110
And this chart shows that we actually are the number one hoppy beer provider in

460
00:26:39.111 --> 00:26:41.660
the state of Massachusetts,
which is pretty crazy.

461
00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:45.420
That middle column was velocity.
That's really tells us like if a costs,

462
00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:48.270
how often does a customer pick our beer over other people's beer?

463
00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:52.020
And you can see we're almost at two to one ratio over kind of our next closest

464
00:26:52.021 --> 00:26:54.240
peers,
which is pretty incredible to see.

465
00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:57.870
Our Sour can series is classified as a specialty beer.

466
00:26:58.170 --> 00:27:01.560
It is the number two specialty beer in the market just behind Budweiser.

467
00:27:01.561 --> 00:27:05.630
Amber lager.
I don't know who's drinking that crap,
but uh,
but,
uh,

468
00:27:05.631 --> 00:27:07.710
clearly a lot of people are,
uh,
we,

469
00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:11.580
we like those showcase here that our velocity is a lot better than theirs.

470
00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:16.000
We're in just less stores than Budweiser is in,
uh,
if we were in more stores,

471
00:27:16.001 --> 00:27:18.000
we would probably be beating them nightlight.

472
00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:22.500
We set out to be that kind of macro nooses and we released it about 26 weeks
ago.

473
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:26.370
Uh,
so right now we're basically in the top six of light beers,

474
00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:31.170
which were pretty shocked to see that we're beating out big multi or global

475
00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:35.100
breweries with multimillion dollar advertising campaigns.
Uh,

476
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:39.210
and that we're actually playing somewhat successfully in this market without

477
00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:43.620
really any advertising budget at all other than Instagram.
So that's been fun.

478
00:27:43.621 --> 00:27:44.640
That to take away mind share.

479
00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:47.660
And some of these guys are down almost as much as we're up.
So we're,

480
00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:49.830
we like to think we're directly stealing from their pie.

481
00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:53.940
If you look at just crappy across all styles in Massachusetts,

482
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.470
we're numbered three right now,

483
00:27:55.471 --> 00:27:58.500
just a few hundred thousand dollars behind Harpoon.
But again,

484
00:27:58.501 --> 00:28:02.010
we're beating out a bunch of national brewers that have much more resources that

485
00:28:02.011 --> 00:28:06.150
have been around much more longer than us.
Um,
this is ranked by velocity again.

486
00:28:06.151 --> 00:28:09.790
So in the state where we are the second fastest beer.
So this,

487
00:28:09.791 --> 00:28:12.890
this helps us a lot in our selling story.
When we go to market.
Uh,

488
00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:16.920
if a liquor store is designed to carry us versus let's say,
you know,

489
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:21.140
dogfish head,
we'll sell three times more volume than dogfish head wound,

490
00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:22.013
that same store.

491
00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:25.740
And then if you bring in the national brewers or the global brewers,
again,

492
00:28:25.741 --> 00:28:29.550
we are a top 10 brand in the state,
which is pretty incredible.
Uh,

493
00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:31.380
this is again a testament to kind of our deep,

494
00:28:31.381 --> 00:28:35.870
not wide philosophy of really trying to get our brand in front of Massachusetts

495
00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:39.000
consumers and make it just as recognizable as some of these other big beer

496
00:28:39.001 --> 00:28:41.790
brands.
We really only package our beer in 16 ounces,
four packs.

497
00:28:41.791 --> 00:28:45.900
So another way to slice the data set is to look at packaging format.
And if you,

498
00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:49.080
if you take all beer across all global brewers in the,

499
00:28:49.081 --> 00:28:51.360
in the state that play in the liquor stores,
uh,

500
00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:55.830
and look at only 16 ounce four pack sales,
we are by far the dominant.
Um,

501
00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:00.090
I'd like to say the king,
uh,
we're top point Budweiser pretty heavily here and,

502
00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:03.780
and we're,
we're a far market leader compared to our peers in the,
in the state.

503
00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:05.010
Just really,
again,

504
00:29:05.011 --> 00:29:07.940
kind of humbling for us to see that this kind of idea from our Somerville

505
00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:12.420
kitchen is actually like really taken off.
But nonetheless,
we're not done yet.
Uh,

506
00:29:12.421 --> 00:29:15.300
we're,
we're sending out to 2019 to try to create even better.

507
00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:19.620
We're building a Boston tap room.
I love joy wharf right next to the garden.

508
00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:22.860
It will have a brewery in there,
a kitchen and a coffee bar,

509
00:29:22.861 --> 00:29:25.860
which is something called kitchen and coffee bar.
All new for us.

510
00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:28.950
It will really be our innovation factory and a lot of our new ideas will be

511
00:29:28.951 --> 00:29:33.190
first developed there before scaling up and going out to the wholesale world.
Uh,

512
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:36.630
where again,
continue even better workplace.
Any more benefits,

513
00:29:36.631 --> 00:29:39.200
adding more resources,
adding more internal training.
That's,

514
00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:42.490
that's super important.
We're trying to make ourselves the best place to work,

515
00:29:42.491 --> 00:29:45.550
although I don't know if we can compete with all your amenities,
but we'll try.

516
00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:50.290
Uh,
I think we do have more free beer.
Um,
uh,

517
00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:53.620
we're continuing down that macro nuisance line and we're going to launch

518
00:29:53.621 --> 00:29:54.520
limelight this year,

519
00:29:54.521 --> 00:29:58.300
which is definitely a direct shot at bud light lime we think will be better.

520
00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:03.300
It will use better lime ingredients and a w if it's at all success successful as

521
00:30:03.461 --> 00:30:06.570
nightlight.
We think what we'll have another big winner on her hand.
Um,

522
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:10.000
we're continuing to invest in production.

523
00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:12.580
We're continuing to add more sour styles.
There'll be a fourth one,

524
00:30:12.581 --> 00:30:16.750
kind of the mix brier,
a ramble wise,
which will be a blackberry sour with lemon.

525
00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:21.690
Uh,
and then the next kind of two big questions for us is,
is what do we,

526
00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:26.720
we sell 90% of our beer in Massachusetts and only a beer that we make.

527
00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:30.520
Can we grow beyond Massachusetts and replicate what we've done in this state and

528
00:30:30.521 --> 00:30:32.410
other states.
With the regulatory environment,

529
00:30:32.411 --> 00:30:35.080
you kind of have to like re invent the wheel in every state.

530
00:30:35.081 --> 00:30:36.430
They all have different liquor laws,

531
00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:38.410
which makes it really confusing and challenging.

532
00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:41.920
But can we replicate the brewery and the tap room experience somewhere else?

533
00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:44.230
And can we also replicate our wholesale,
um,

534
00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:48.160
operation and other states and that those are kind of the two big undertakings

535
00:30:48.161 --> 00:30:49.180
as we look future.

536
00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:53.560
And then the third one is should we do other beverages and take the same sort of

537
00:30:53.561 --> 00:30:58.360
lens of creating better to other beverages?
Could we do it for spirits,
coffee,

538
00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:03.590
wine,
cider,
Kombucha or whatever we are excited and passionate about and uh,
and,

539
00:31:03.591 --> 00:31:04.800
and kind of take the,

540
00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:07.090
what the lessons we've learned from beer and apply it elsewhere.

541
00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:12.200
And I think there are file knows just every day we tried to create better.

542
00:31:12.201 --> 00:31:16.200
And I think you guys do the same and we appreciate your time.
Um,

543
00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:18.470
and we can open up to any questions and answers.

544
00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:25.350
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

545
00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:29.210
<v 5>let me ask you a timely question.</v>

546
00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:34.590
A certain other brewery in the Boston areas having some very widely publicized

547
00:31:35.801 --> 00:31:38.360
labor issues right now.
Um,

548
00:31:38.361 --> 00:31:43.361
seems like they made some pretty appalling cuts to the wages of some workers in

549
00:31:43.401 --> 00:31:47.390
now seem to be like boomerang.
I mean,
way back in the other direction.

550
00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:51.680
Maybe this is just two people who made some bad decisions,

551
00:31:51.681 --> 00:31:56.150
but it seems like the first time that attention has been drawn to the labor

552
00:31:56.151 --> 00:31:59.210
practices of craft brewers.
Uh,

553
00:31:59.211 --> 00:32:01.490
I'm sure you guys are thinking about this a lot.

554
00:32:01.491 --> 00:32:05.810
I'm wondering what the implications might be.
Um,

555
00:32:05.811 --> 00:32:06.980
in terms of,
you know,

556
00:32:06.981 --> 00:32:11.780
like wages in the industry of general employment practices.

557
00:32:12.290 --> 00:32:16.010
How much is this going to have any kind of widespread impact or is it just a

558
00:32:16.011 --> 00:32:18.200
kind of one shot thing that's going to die out

559
00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:20.680
<v 4>a few days?
Uh,
I mean,</v>

560
00:32:20.681 --> 00:32:23.980
I don't want us to speak to the specific situation of the brewery or referencing

561
00:32:23.981 --> 00:32:24.281
too,

562
00:32:24.281 --> 00:32:29.281
but the traditionally the beer industry hasn't been one that's been a good place

563
00:32:30.101 --> 00:32:31.840
to make a living wage.
Uh,

564
00:32:31.841 --> 00:32:35.740
we've always set out to try to create a place that people should earn an income.

565
00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:38.080
If you ever read through some of my older I use,

566
00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:42.050
I usually banter on beer advocate,
uh,
forums.
Uh,
I've,

567
00:32:42.051 --> 00:32:46.460
I've justified our higher prices,
beers around a pain are people more,

568
00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:50.000
uh,
and the higher cost of doing business in the Boston Metro area.

569
00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:53.630
That's important to us.
Uh,
as the mass brewer's guild,

570
00:32:53.631 --> 00:32:57.890
we are certainly open to doing some sort of compensation studies so that we can

571
00:32:57.891 --> 00:33:01.640
all benchmark how we compare to our peers.
Um,
and,
and,

572
00:33:01.641 --> 00:33:04.550
and make sure that everyone understands like kind of where the market is.

573
00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:08.630
We obviously can't get into the anti competitive territory of price fixing
wages,

574
00:33:08.631 --> 00:33:12.540
but,
uh,
I think there is more that could be done to,

575
00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:14.750
to make sure that everyone's compensated correctly.

576
00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:18.320
I think the three of us never started this to get rich.
That's not our motive.
Um,

577
00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:21.620
and we've always felt that we should say share the success with the people who

578
00:33:21.621 --> 00:33:22.454
create it.

579
00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:25.453
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

580
00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:28.720
<v 4>Talk a little about packaging.
You talked about going from,</v>

581
00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:32.680
from a seven corked and caged,
seven fifties to cans.

582
00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:36.610
Why'd you end up on the 16 ounce cans?
I know it's what everyone is doing,

583
00:33:36.611 --> 00:33:41.320
but why 16 not 12 I personally find 16 to be kind of more than I usually want.

584
00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:45.460
It's definitely something we went back and forth on.
I mean,

585
00:33:45.461 --> 00:33:49.360
we showed a picture of where we first did do twelves and the kind of initial

586
00:33:49.361 --> 00:33:53.790
feedback was that it would be cooler if they were in tall boys.
And,
uh,
I,

587
00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:57.430
I would certainly credit a lot of that to the alchemists and heady topper.

588
00:33:57.730 --> 00:33:59.950
I feel like they kind of like pave the way of like,

589
00:33:59.951 --> 00:34:03.880
this is where the cool kids go.
Uh,
but I do agree,

590
00:34:03.881 --> 00:34:05.470
we do make nightlight in 12 ounces,

591
00:34:05.471 --> 00:34:08.980
which is our first kind of return back to the 12 ounce.
And uh,

592
00:34:08.981 --> 00:34:12.820
for the first like three or four months to 16 ounces where king,

593
00:34:12.821 --> 00:34:13.890
but now the 12 ounces are,

594
00:34:13.891 --> 00:34:17.710
are kind of taking over as far as the preferred a package type.
And it,

595
00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:20.980
we're definitely now considering should we move other beers into either both

596
00:34:20.981 --> 00:34:24.490
formats or are back down to 12 about like the 9% ones in 12 hours.

597
00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:30.390
<v 2>I agree with you.
That's a little much for me to,
um,
I also just want to add,</v>

598
00:34:30.391 --> 00:34:33.850
like it seems that the 16 ounce format,
um,

599
00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:37.800
is somewhat of a new England phenomenon.
Um,
you know,
you go,

600
00:34:37.801 --> 00:34:40.400
you venture outside of New England and it is,
you know,

601
00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:44.700
you still see a lot of 12 ounce bottles,
you see a lot of 12 ounce cans.
Um,

602
00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:48.960
so,
and one of the other aspects was,
okay,

603
00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:52.260
we use the same amount of volume in the same amount of time to fill bigger

604
00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:56.940
format.
It's,
it's cost us less in the long run.
It's,
it's slightly small.
Um,

605
00:34:57.330 --> 00:35:01.380
but a bunch of those things combined kind of,
you know,
let us to this to be like,

606
00:35:01.381 --> 00:35:04.720
okay,
we need to compete in this market.
16 ounces or New England phenomenon,

607
00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:06.650
let's,
let's at least play around with it

608
00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:07.550
<v 4>data wise too.</v>

609
00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:11.740
We have some of our distro brewery partners that sent those 12 ounce cans and

610
00:35:11.741 --> 00:35:13.180
they didn't sell very well and we asked them,

611
00:35:13.181 --> 00:35:15.490
can you put them in sixteens and we'll see if it sells better.

612
00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:19.630
And some of them did do that for us and the 16th did sell better,
which is,

613
00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:23.740
it was just kind of crazy.
Um,
the,
especially ones from out of state where like,

614
00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:25.450
well everyone wants 12 in our market,
white,

615
00:35:25.570 --> 00:35:27.250
we're not going to make something special for you guys.

616
00:35:27.251 --> 00:35:29.260
But when the velocity increased,
it was worth it.

617
00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:34.570
So with like the craft beer scene growing so much,
has that changed?

618
00:35:34.571 --> 00:35:36.590
I guess the way you guys look at what you're doing.

619
00:35:36.591 --> 00:35:38.070
So I'm sure when he out it wasn't as

620
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:39.990
<v 2>big of a,
of a fad,</v>

621
00:35:39.991 --> 00:35:43.350
but nowadays you see different places popping up all over the place,

622
00:35:43.351 --> 00:35:44.430
which is great for the consumer.

623
00:35:44.431 --> 00:35:47.700
But I just wonder if it changes the way you look at things at all.
And also,

624
00:35:47.701 --> 00:35:51.630
do you have any other favorite um,
non night shift fears?

625
00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:55.740
<v 1>Sure.
I'll start this one.
Um,</v>

626
00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:59.720
I mean one of the brewers we consistently look up to is Allagash.
Um,
there,

627
00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:04.600
you know,
that beautiful branding,
uh,
incredible beer,
great leadership,
um,

628
00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:07.170
really good QA QC program.
Uh,

629
00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:11.250
they seem to sort of check all the boxes in terms of like excellent brewery.

630
00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:16.090
And so they've sort of become like a great model and staple for us.
Uh,

631
00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:18.360
in terms of how we look at the industry.
I mean,

632
00:36:18.361 --> 00:36:22.260
I think rob kind of touched upon it earlier,
but I do think,
you know,

633
00:36:22.261 --> 00:36:27.180
if you look at overall industry tent trends,
you know,
bureau is somewhat flat.
Um,

634
00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:28.800
we're,
we're not.
Um,

635
00:36:28.801 --> 00:36:31.470
and so we definitely feel like we can continue competing and growing and

636
00:36:31.471 --> 00:36:35.270
innovating on the brewery perspective and,
um,
you know,

637
00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:39.360
adding a tap room allows us to connect with consumers,
uh,
you know,

638
00:36:39.361 --> 00:36:43.330
sort of in our space.
Um,
so doing that in Boston,
um,

639
00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:48.750
it was just sort of building on the,
the tap room success that we've had,
uh,

640
00:36:48.751 --> 00:36:53.550
and sort of diversifying our portfolio between wholesale involvement and sort of

641
00:36:53.551 --> 00:36:58.140
on premise taproom involvement.
Um,
but looking into other beverages,

642
00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:02.400
um,
is is something that we consistently or have consistently talked about.
But,

643
00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:06.990
uh,
it started to become a more and more real conversation,
uh,
as we look at like,

644
00:37:06.991 --> 00:37:08.350
what is the future for,
you know,

645
00:37:08.370 --> 00:37:13.020
not just night shift brewing but like night shift the family.
So when you guys do

646
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:16.720
<v 2>collaborative,
uh,
beers,
uh,
how do you decide where the beer is brewed?</v>

647
00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:20.800
That's a good question.
Um,

648
00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:22.620
I don't know if I know the answer to that to be honest.

649
00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:27.220
<v 4>Uh,
I think it usually depends.
Sometimes we coordinated around travel,</v>

650
00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:30.610
whether it's somebody's going on vacation or somebody is coming for like extreme

651
00:37:30.611 --> 00:37:34.030
beer fest by beer advocate.
Hey,
um,
you know,

652
00:37:34.031 --> 00:37:36.280
why don't you come a day earlier and we'll hang out.

653
00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:40.570
A lot of those collaborations are really a great opportunity for brewers swap,

654
00:37:40.571 --> 00:37:44.650
like inside,
you know,
techniques and methods and processes.

655
00:37:44.651 --> 00:37:48.580
That is kind of the real secret value behind those.

656
00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:52.900
There are of course really fun and it's fun to kind of mash up the either the

657
00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:56.680
styles that breweries are known for or their label art and stuff like that.
And,

658
00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:58.180
and we do a fair amount of them,

659
00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:01.120
but they're definitely not big revenue generators for us.
For us.

660
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:04.840
<v 2>I would also say a lot of the collaborations that we've done,
uh,</v>

661
00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:09.090
I've kind of gone back and forth.
It's kind of like a serial collaboration,

662
00:38:09.091 --> 00:38:10.200
if you will.
Uh,

663
00:38:10.201 --> 00:38:13.110
so one time we'll do a collaboration at night shift and then we'll sell that

664
00:38:13.111 --> 00:38:14.550
beer,
you know,
through our tap room.

665
00:38:14.551 --> 00:38:17.580
And then the next time we'll traveled with APP or into a collaboration over

666
00:38:17.581 --> 00:38:20.130
there with them so they get a chance to sell that beer through their tap room

667
00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:24.990
and things like that.
So,
um,
it's a true collaboration.
I wanted to ask about,
uh,

668
00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:26.640
the new flavor process.

669
00:38:26.641 --> 00:38:30.780
So like now that it's not just three of you working on,
you know,

670
00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:32.850
let's throw this in there and see what happens.

671
00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:36.850
You mentioned you have a new blackberry coming out I think was how many people

672
00:38:36.851 --> 00:38:39.010
are involved with that or how do you decide on the recipe?

673
00:38:39.011 --> 00:38:40.900
How do you kind of push that to market?

674
00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:44.970
<v 1>We used to be involved in every single recipe because it was ours.
I mean,</v>

675
00:38:44.971 --> 00:38:46.200
I think when we launched,

676
00:38:46.201 --> 00:38:50.190
like every single one was in a notebook somewhere that we had home brewed a

677
00:38:50.191 --> 00:38:54.780
bunch and we sort of brought it to market and watched it evolve.
Um,

678
00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:56.070
but you know,

679
00:38:56.071 --> 00:38:58.650
as we've hired a team and when we have people that can make beer that's way

680
00:38:58.651 --> 00:39:02.850
better than any of us could.
So,
um,
we didn't trust our people.
Uh,
we,

681
00:39:02.851 --> 00:39:04.530
we definitely have input on sort of like,

682
00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:08.340
where do we want division or where do we see the company going from a vision

683
00:39:08.341 --> 00:39:11.400
perspective of like,
all right,
we want to get more into sour.
So like,

684
00:39:11.401 --> 00:39:15.090
let's develop those recipes and um,
sort of set that direction.

685
00:39:15.091 --> 00:39:18.380
But like our team of our production team,

686
00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:22.350
which is actually don't it,
what's the size in terms of staff?

687
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:25.770
I think it's like a dozen plus people.
Okay.
Yeah.

688
00:39:25.771 --> 00:39:29.190
So I was gonna say like 15 people,
they crush it every single day.

689
00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:34.120
And so we trust them to,
to nail it,
execute,
innovate.
Um,
you know,
we,
we,

690
00:39:34.121 --> 00:39:37.430
we sort of have like our wholesale market beers and then we have like our tap

691
00:39:37.431 --> 00:39:38.580
room beers.
Um,

692
00:39:38.581 --> 00:39:41.670
and we've actually kind of blended a little bit over the last year and putting

693
00:39:41.671 --> 00:39:44.000
more small batch stuff out into the market.
Um,

694
00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:47.670
but we see a lot of our innovation happen with those smaller batch releases.

695
00:39:47.671 --> 00:39:51.150
We have smaller tanks that are basically exclusively reserved for that.

696
00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:55.560
And then the brewers are basically just given like,
you know,
freewill.

697
00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:59.190
They're just come up with whatever you think is interesting and cool,
put it out,

698
00:39:59.191 --> 00:40:03.300
see how it performs,
and then we scale up appropriately based on success,

699
00:40:03.301 --> 00:40:08.220
feedback,
all that stuff.
Um,
it's,
it's a really fun,
creative process and again,

700
00:40:08.221 --> 00:40:11.910
like our team is trusted to do it and we just kind of sit back and go like,

701
00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:14.130
awesome.
That's the direction.
And keep going.

702
00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:17.820
<v 6>I'm curious about your new light beer offering.
Um,</v>

703
00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:22.940
I'm curious why no other craft breweries are very few other craft breweries seem

704
00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:24.030
to be going down this road.

705
00:40:24.031 --> 00:40:27.870
And I'm also curious like what the different challenges are as far as both

706
00:40:28.350 --> 00:40:32.550
technically brewing and marketing,
this kind of very different offering.

707
00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:36.040
<v 2>I think that there is a couple of reasons.
Um,
you know,</v>

708
00:40:36.041 --> 00:40:39.580
there are a few craft breweries doing it.
Um,
there are,
you know,

709
00:40:39.581 --> 00:40:41.770
some of them are the,
the bigger craft breweries.

710
00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:45.610
And I think part of the reason for that is it's kind of a daunting task because

711
00:40:45.611 --> 00:40:50.290
the market is pretty much cornered by like bud light,
Miller light.
Um,

712
00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:52.230
so,
you know,

713
00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:56.140
they've already kind of got a huge head start on that and it's hard to kind of

714
00:40:56.141 --> 00:40:58.480
break into that.
Um,
you know,
we,

715
00:40:58.590 --> 00:41:03.280
we had success and got lucky with our branding and um,
you know,

716
00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:05.620
it's kind of something that people I think we're looking for.

717
00:41:05.621 --> 00:41:09.350
But I think that's one of the,
one of the bigger reasons for that.
Um,

718
00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:13.570
that coupled with they demand a lower price point.
Um,
you know,

719
00:41:13.571 --> 00:41:17.220
people go out and they buy a light beer that's you know,
4%.
Um,

720
00:41:17.290 --> 00:41:21.350
they don't expect to pay 15,
$16 for,
you know,

721
00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:26.430
a four pack that they expect to pay a lot less per 12 ounce 12 pack.

722
00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:29.650
Um,
so you know,
that,

723
00:41:29.651 --> 00:41:33.160
that's part of it too because a lot of other craft breweries including,

724
00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:33.980
and that's one

725
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:37.910
<v 1>of the reasons why we held off on actually going full force into it for,</v>

726
00:41:37.911 --> 00:41:41.760
for awhile.
It was because you know,
it,
it is lower margins.
Um,

727
00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:44.090
and it's a tougher beer to brew.

728
00:41:44.091 --> 00:41:46.700
There's not much other flavored hide behind if you,

729
00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:50.390
if you don't brew it right or don't have great quality control and things like

730
00:41:50.391 --> 00:41:52.760
that.
So it kind of all those things combined.
I mean,

731
00:41:52.761 --> 00:41:54.500
I can't speak for any other brewery really,

732
00:41:54.501 --> 00:41:59.501
but I would assume that those are all big reasons for not for them not really

733
00:41:59.870 --> 00:42:00.740
entering that market.

734
00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:05.180
<v 4>And I'll just add this data only chose two PAC tights.</v>

735
00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:09.920
Bud lite is packaged in like so many different class bottles,

736
00:42:09.921 --> 00:42:14.690
18 packs,
24 packs,
30 packs,
uh,
that if you look at that number,

737
00:42:14.691 --> 00:42:17.420
that's almost 9 million here,
I think it's in 26 weeks.

738
00:42:17.421 --> 00:42:22.050
It's something like almost 50 million.
So while we're making a dent,
we're,

739
00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:26.610
we're nowhere near the Goliath that is bud light.
Um,
that,

740
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:30.310
that beer is going down every year.
They're selling less and less of it,
but,
uh,

741
00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:32.780
it's a big hurdle to attack.
It's something like,

742
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:37.070
I think 40% of the beer drank and the state is bud light,
which is ridiculous.

743
00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:40.660
<v 1>I just want to add one thing based on your question,
right?</v>

744
00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:45.730
I think we've almost put it in like our breweries DNA to ask questions like what

745
00:42:45.731 --> 00:42:48.430
you just asked,
which is like,
why isn't anyone doing?
Like,

746
00:42:48.431 --> 00:42:49.600
why aren't more people doing that?

747
00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:52.540
And like if that question gets asked her on the brewery and we can't come up

748
00:42:52.541 --> 00:42:56.100
with a good answer,
it's just like,
okay,
go there,
like go in that direction.

749
00:42:56.110 --> 00:42:58.930
That's really interesting and at least explore.
Um,

750
00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:00.190
and that's Kinda what we're trying to do.

751
00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:03.340
<v 4>And it's a similar thing to start your own distribution company.</v>

752
00:43:03.341 --> 00:43:06.400
Everyone told her last night,
it's way too hard.
You guys can't figure it out.

753
00:43:06.401 --> 00:43:08.830
Brewers can't just run a distribution company.

754
00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:11.350
There's guys who's done this for decades.

755
00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:14.380
Jen multigeneration businesses that are billion dollar revenues,

756
00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:17.350
just give it to them.
They'll get it there.
And it was like,
no,

757
00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:19.300
we're going to try and do it ourselves.
So I'm going to do a better than you.

758
00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:22.360
Right.
We don't always do it better,
but we try.

759
00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:25.890
<v 7>Uh,
thanks for really good beer of the ears.
Um,</v>

760
00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:28.850
can you talk about your improvement process after you release a beer?
Uh,

761
00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:31.740
I swear that a whirlpool has got one more bitter over the years.

762
00:43:31.741 --> 00:43:33.750
So I'm curious like once he released a beer,

763
00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:36.840
do you actually go back and look at it and like try and improve the recipe or do

764
00:43:36.841 --> 00:43:38.610
you try and keep it as consistent as possible?

765
00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:44.090
<v 4>I would say there's always a little bit of evolution in the beers as,
as they,</v>

766
00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:47.830
as they,
as time goes by as the brewers tweak them,
uh,

767
00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:50.040
and try to get them better and better.
Uh,

768
00:43:50.110 --> 00:43:54.570
obviously taste is subjective and not all the times it is better.
Uh,

769
00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:58.460
the other component I'll add is that it is an agricultural product at the end of

770
00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:01.760
the day.
Mosaic hopps from year to year do not always taste the same,

771
00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:04.010
which is a challenge.
And we,

772
00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:08.330
and that's some of the tweaking is derived from that,
uh,
around,
uh,

773
00:44:08.331 --> 00:44:11.800
crop variability.
Uh,
but we do have a,
uh,

774
00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:17.020
a tasting program where different versions of whirlpool or tasted a against

775
00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:21.050
benchmark batches versus how they're aging on shelves.

776
00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:25.700
And if product is skewing out of what everyone teams is whirlpool,

777
00:44:25.701 --> 00:44:28.880
then then we reevaluate what went wrong or what changed and,

778
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.300
and things like that.
Um,
but it,

779
00:44:31.301 --> 00:44:34.440
it's definitely hard to keep it as consistent.
So,
I mean,

780
00:44:34.770 --> 00:44:37.240
for all the shinny on Bud light,
I've done,
uh,

781
00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:40.590
they do an amazing job of getting that right.
Uh,

782
00:44:40.591 --> 00:44:42.690
and that's something that we can't quite compete with,

783
00:44:42.691 --> 00:44:47.010
but we try our best and we do have Qa QC processes in a,

784
00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:49.590
in line to try to mitigate any,
any drift.

785
00:44:51.970 --> 00:44:56.430
<v 3>Thanks everyone.
