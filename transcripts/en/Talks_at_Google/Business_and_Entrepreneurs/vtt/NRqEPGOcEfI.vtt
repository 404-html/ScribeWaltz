1
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.160
Okay.
Thanks for coming along to this.
And so it's based on this book.

2
00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.390
There are still some free copies left upfront if you want them.

3
00:00:14.391 --> 00:00:18.410
So I was doing the research on this book when I was based in China at the top

4
00:00:18.411 --> 00:00:19.400
business school there,
China,

5
00:00:19.401 --> 00:00:24.260
Europe International Business School from 2011 to 2016.

6
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.290
Um,
so just to,

7
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.500
and the subtitle is really the theme of my talk from Imitation to innovation.

8
00:00:32.511 --> 00:00:37.160
You used to hear about how China's like imitation nights about innovation.

9
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.190
In the early days,
of course China was just copying when it first,
you know,

10
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.640
from 1978 onwards,

11
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.020
the copying products were illegal sometimes of course,
Sean Gi,

12
00:00:48.021 --> 00:00:50.230
which means mountain bandits.
Uh,

13
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.260
you see here a product called the block berry endorsed by President Obama

14
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.700
probably without his knowledge on the right,
something that surprises you.

15
00:00:58.701 --> 00:01:02.930
This is not a cigarette packet pretending to be a moat,
a cell phone.

16
00:01:02.931 --> 00:01:06.650
It's a cell phone pretending to be a cigarette packet just to show you how

17
00:01:06.651 --> 00:01:10.220
different the Chinese can be.
They actually loves smoking so much.

18
00:01:10.221 --> 00:01:13.460
Some of them wanted to pretend their cell phone.
It was a cigarette packets.

19
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.330
So then China starts moving from copying to fit for purpose.

20
00:01:20.331 --> 00:01:24.170
So you know,
in the earlier days,
1980s,
1970s,

21
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.140
China was poorer,
lower per capita income.

22
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.090
So sort of practical innovations such as mood,
Guangdong,
crane,

23
00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:36.290
moving from double welded a single weld.
It's a lot of process innovations.

24
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.240
China of course makes more solar panels than anybody else and the critical

25
00:01:41.241 --> 00:01:41.691
innovation,

26
00:01:41.691 --> 00:01:45.380
their self cleaning because if you have a dusty solar panel then that's a

27
00:01:45.381 --> 00:01:49.280
massive problem.
So in the beginning,
these are not rocket science innovations,

28
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.110
but typical Chinese innovations,
they are pragmatic and profitable.

29
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.540
Um,
then you start seeing,
I'll talk a bit more later on about Alibaba Tao Bao.

30
00:01:59.541 --> 00:02:04.541
These online systems where we start seeing innovation in online higher,

31
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.450
uh,
one of their biggest and probably the most international company,

32
00:02:08.451 --> 00:02:11.870
major appliances.
Now the world's biggest major appliance companies.

33
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.880
Lots of initially small innovations.
Like early on they found that um,

34
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.450
their washing machines were getting clogged up in rural areas.

35
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.170
They discovered was because the farmers were using them to wash potatoes rather

36
00:02:24.171 --> 00:02:25.004
than just clothes.

37
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.910
Now Western response might have been to put a label saying do not wash crops.

38
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.930
Instead,

39
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.860
their innovation was they changed the filter system and add a label saying

40
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.360
sooner for,
for both clothes and crops,
refrigerators.

41
00:02:38.361 --> 00:02:42.320
When they first moved to the u s market,
they weren't at the lower end,

42
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.040
such as college dorm rooms.
And they realize that college dorms was small,

43
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.140
so they added a folding table top to double up as a desk or trivial innovation.

44
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.290
Today they have a more significant innovation,
technical,

45
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.940
they have innovated the world's first three temperature compartments.

46
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.970
The third compartment is designed to store the food that is the most important

47
00:03:03.971 --> 00:03:08.710
to Americans.
What food is that now?
Not Pizza.

48
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.710
Anything else?
Ice Cream.

49
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.300
What's wrong when you take the ice cream out of the icebox?
It's too hard.

50
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.000
And Americans don't like to wait.

51
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.320
So it took a Chinese company to have this insight and then typical Chinese

52
00:03:23.321 --> 00:03:28.321
innovation to invest the R and d money and were able to manufacture it in an

53
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.300
economical way.
So this is the typical innovation,

54
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.920
but they've now moving beyond this.

55
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.960
They're moving toward waterless washing machines,
for example.
So,
you know,

56
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.340
genuine technological innovations.

57
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.210
Chinese are very customer focused as well.
Um,

58
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.950
I'll just talk about the bottom ones.
We visited a number of startups,

59
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.840
so a suture,
nano,
micro worldclass nano products,

60
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.220
Svg,
Optronics,

61
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.180
they make security films over id cards and so on that are higher than the

62
00:03:58.181 --> 00:04:01.450
quality you find in the USA on the European Union.

63
00:04:01.451 --> 00:04:04.270
I'll talk about some of these other companies in a moment as well.

64
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.670
The entire ecosystem for Alibaba,

65
00:04:06.671 --> 00:04:10.600
I'll talk more about good baby makes 80% of the world's baby carriages.

66
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.130
The typical innovation now are you hold the baby in one arm and one button that

67
00:04:15.131 --> 00:04:19.090
you press folds up the baby carriage.
Again,

68
00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:21.260
a typical Chinese innovation,
uh,

69
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.010
you have to invest in it requires significant manufacturing capability.

70
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.160
Now they start to make things sort of bit more technically advanced.

71
00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:37.060
So 10 cent social networking,
instant messaging service,

72
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.410
online gaming and so on.
Medical devices are very big in China,

73
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.750
aging population.
Um,

74
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.810
and then in the intersection of online and medical devices are going to be very

75
00:04:49.451 --> 00:04:51.520
big sector in China as well.

76
00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.920
Sell me the mobile phone company sends out software upgrades every week based on

77
00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.270
input from its millions of customers.

78
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.150
And then the bottom new software in example,

79
00:05:04.151 --> 00:05:09.010
of integrating medical devices and information technology.

80
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.130
So just,
and these are organized,
uh,
to relate to each other.

81
00:05:15.131 --> 00:05:19.510
So of course with the solar panels we have the,
um,
wind energy,

82
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.070
the third one,

83
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.970
they're now experimenting with roads using solar power to recharge the bus as it

84
00:05:28.481 --> 00:05:33.481
drives along that also the typical Chinese innovation is that it requires a top

85
00:05:33.641 --> 00:05:36.370
down government to put in that kind of innovation.

86
00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.590
Can you imagine trying to do that in the streets of Cambridge,

87
00:05:38.591 --> 00:05:42.970
Massachusetts of putting in a system like that on the top right.

88
00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:48.100
Huawei for telecoms company now the largest telecoms equipment company in the

89
00:05:48.101 --> 00:05:52.120
world.
Genuine innovation,
creating a product that ran two G,

90
00:05:52.121 --> 00:05:55.210
three G and four G in one product.
Again,

91
00:05:55.211 --> 00:05:59.480
typical Chinese orientation to the customer cause this was more practical for

92
00:05:59.481 --> 00:06:04.130
the customer to have only one machine and now

93
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.160
investing more and more in r and d.
Uh,
it has r and d centers around the world,

94
00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:13.730
for example,
outside Milan,
Italy.
It has a microwave,

95
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.950
a research technology center,
hiring Italian scientist,

96
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.400
keeping them in the local ecosystem,
the middle row,

97
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.170
high speed trains of course initially copied.
Um,

98
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.050
the Chinese chain company was sued by Siemens and Hitachi,

99
00:06:30.051 --> 00:06:32.210
but there's breeze through that.
China of course,

100
00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.320
has more high speed rail tracks and anywhere else in the world,

101
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.060
I don't think the US is a single mile of high speed rail.
Moses,

102
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.913
the United Kingdom.

103
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.060
And of course this means they also build more trains that are now innovating

104
00:06:44.061 --> 00:06:44.720
with.

105
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.520
And I'm sending all the selling all over the world in the middle.

106
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.400
Aerial drones.
China did not invent aerial joins,

107
00:06:52.401 --> 00:06:54.860
but most aerial drones and are manufactured in China.

108
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.660
And this is a product that's classically Susan for Chinese innovation in that

109
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:04.070
innovation for this product happens better next door to the factory.
Why?

110
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:05.690
Because innovations are,
you know,

111
00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:10.000
to add more rotors to change the carrying capacity,
make it bigger,
make smaller.

112
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:14.390
There is now,
um,
a Chinese one that can carry a person.

113
00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:18.310
Good luck traveling in that yourself one day.
Um,

114
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.920
and this is opposed to say something like a mobile,

115
00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.760
a cell phone where you do the innovation in California and you haven't

116
00:07:25.761 --> 00:07:26.690
manufactured in China.

117
00:07:26.691 --> 00:07:31.160
So also this is a product that is based on metal,

118
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.130
plastics and some electronic combination.
Again,

119
00:07:34.131 --> 00:07:38.990
ideal for the lower cost Chinese engineers and scientists.
And on the right,

120
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:42.620
this is the mid size jet that China has just has flown,

121
00:07:42.621 --> 00:07:46.370
is going to go up against Boeing and Airbus.
Why is it able to do that?

122
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:51.200
Cause China buys more new jet aircraft than any other country in the world.

123
00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:55.010
It already has 500 advanced orders before it is proven.

124
00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.550
And of course most of those advanced orders are coming from Chinese airlines who

125
00:07:58.551 --> 00:08:03.551
have to buy from this state owned a manufacturing initially copying but with

126
00:08:04.611 --> 00:08:06.470
innovations that they're going to add.

127
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:09.170
And within forced technology chancellor from the West,

128
00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:14.260
which is why we have this tariff wars just started in the last week or so now.

129
00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:18.620
Uh,
the Internet based innovations are different.

130
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:23.870
The traditional innovations in China are based on low cost engineers for both R

131
00:08:23.871 --> 00:08:27.380
and D and for manufacturing.
Wow.

132
00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:31.760
That is less the case with Internet based companies where these mines
reputation,

133
00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.280
and you know a lot more about this than I do,

134
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:38.750
is that Internet based innovation comes from experimentation with large numbers

135
00:08:38.751 --> 00:08:39.584
of customers.

136
00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:44.770
So China has more internet users than any other country in the world.

137
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:47.060
So this is now a great advantage for them.

138
00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:50.170
And toward the end I'll show you some visuals about um,

139
00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:54.080
the Internet ecosystems.
I won't go through the ones I said.

140
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:56.850
You can just look at the PDFs yourself.

141
00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:00.420
So Arthur of model,

142
00:09:00.421 --> 00:09:05.010
our theory of how this happened is that we have for drivers the ones in red and

143
00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:10.011
pink and have three phases and yellow that old go through the first driver

144
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.750
customers.
Initially the customers were poorer,

145
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:17.520
so Chinese companies and western companies had to innovate in China in order to

146
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.570
develop products that were cheap enough.
Um,

147
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.760
the other thing we find is the Chinese customers are quite different than many

148
00:09:23.761 --> 00:09:25.830
of their tastes from the West.
So again,

149
00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:30.950
different types of products needed culture.

150
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:36.540
We have the entrepreneurial culture of Chinese executives and we include on the

151
00:09:36.541 --> 00:09:38.280
culture,
the drive of the government.

152
00:09:38.281 --> 00:09:43.281
The Chinese government really wants innovation now and the word innovation has

153
00:09:43.801 --> 00:09:48.801
reached the top line of the latest five year plan and the made in China 2025

154
00:09:51.241 --> 00:09:55.590
initiative is all about innovating in China rather than just manufacturing

155
00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.490
on the right over time,

156
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:04.730
firms enhance their capabilities to innovate learning from western partners and

157
00:10:05.521 --> 00:10:08.160
also as it became more profitable investing,

158
00:10:08.161 --> 00:10:13.161
the cash that they generated in r and d and to other uses of the cash is setting

159
00:10:14.641 --> 00:10:17.160
up foreign RND centers.
And thirdly,

160
00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:19.980
buying foreign companies for that technology.

161
00:10:19.981 --> 00:10:22.980
And I'll show you some examples of that.
So with this,

162
00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:28.010
they moved from the phase one copying to fit for purpose to moving from being

163
00:10:28.411 --> 00:10:31.170
followers to world standard products.

164
00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.650
And in the third phase,

165
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.530
global expansion including acquisitions,

166
00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:42.660
early acquisitions where resources like oil,
you know,
oil fields,

167
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:47.790
property.
But more and more they're making acquisitions for knowledge.

168
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:50.820
So here are some famous Chinese acquisitions.

169
00:10:50.821 --> 00:10:54.990
Of course the first one was buying IBM personal computer business.

170
00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:57.030
Then another example,

171
00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:01.680
Volvo bought by a mid level Chinese company.

172
00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:03.770
Most of you've never heard of called G Lee.

173
00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.840
One of the reasons they able to buy Volvo is that the Chinese government

174
00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:10.920
designated them as the only Chinese car company allowed to bid for Volvo.

175
00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:15.420
They beat off the non-Chinese our competitors where when they won,

176
00:11:15.421 --> 00:11:20.250
the CEO of Ge said it's like a Chinese peasant marrying a Hollywood movie star.

177
00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:24.570
And of course they're starting to learn technology from Volvo,

178
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:28.830
puts my sister,
uh,
leading construction equipment company in Germany,

179
00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:32.340
bought by now the world's largest construction equipment company.

180
00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:37.530
China's Sonny [inaudible] Club Med,
which I think is for the,

181
00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:41.790
uh,
large,
uh,
evolving leisure market in China.

182
00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:46.770
Most controversial in the Middle Cooker in 2016,

183
00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.990
a Chinese medical device company,
my dear,

184
00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:52.770
bought one of Germany's leading robotics companies for the first time.

185
00:11:52.771 --> 00:11:57.320
The government said,
really,
perhaps we shouldn't let this go.
And the Cha,
uh,

186
00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:01.900
German prime minister,
uh,
asked a German consortium to outbid them,

187
00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:06.850
but they were underbidding 20%,
and it went to China only on the right.

188
00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:08.970
Finally,
last year,
um,

189
00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:14.040
walls one German acquisition blocked x John under US pressure because it makes

190
00:12:14.741 --> 00:12:18.340
semiconductors for,
uh,
some which goes into defense.

191
00:12:18.341 --> 00:12:21.340
So the u s got Germany to block that acquisition,

192
00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:26.440
but there'll be many more such acquisitions because the Chinese have,

193
00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:29.520
uh,
a lot of money.
Uh,

194
00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:32.080
Google is probably safe for now.

195
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:38.740
So the entire Chinese innovation ecosystem is growing.
In fact,

196
00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:39.670
um,

197
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:44.050
the Chinese now have more scientific publications than the USA of course,

198
00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:48.460
so far as quantity rather than quality.
But the quality will follow.

199
00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:52.810
And of course it is the u s and the West that is training ethnic Chinese

200
00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:57.220
scientists.
So if you're going to stem programs,
science,
technology,
engineering,

201
00:12:57.221 --> 00:12:58.120
mathematics,

202
00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:02.800
huge numbers of ethnic Chinese and China now has special government programs to

203
00:13:02.801 --> 00:13:07.180
lure them back.
Also the market is doing the back.
We visited one company,

204
00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:11.530
make flexible display screens,

205
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:14.620
replacing the something that,
you know,
a millimeter thick,

206
00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.230
replacing the entire dashboard of a car,

207
00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:21.490
started by a Chinese phd in electrical engineering from Stanford.

208
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:25.840
But he goes back to China to start the company because cars are being

209
00:13:25.841 --> 00:13:29.470
manufactured in China and it's the biggest car market in the world,
right?

210
00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:32.650
So everything you could system is on the up.

211
00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:37.030
And here is the scariest side of I've come across.

212
00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:40.990
It was presented at Oxford about a year and a half ago by someone representing

213
00:13:40.991 --> 00:13:45.580
the Chinese Academy of Science 22 strategic science and technology initiatives,

214
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:49.340
uh,
that China's pursuing.
I'll just read out some of them.
Uh,

215
00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:54.610
dark matter and dark energy,
controlling the structure of matter,

216
00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:59.740
artificial life in synthetic biology,
nanoscience space science exploration,

217
00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:03.670
ubiquitous sensing based information,
eyes manufacturing systems.

218
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.060
So they're actually going for everything pretty much.

219
00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:11.260
China certainly has the world's largest super camp pewters for example.

220
00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:15.730
All right,
so I'm summarizing our research.

221
00:14:15.731 --> 00:14:19.810
We found that there were 10 major ways in which Chinese company innovation is

222
00:14:19.811 --> 00:14:21.520
different from western innovation.

223
00:14:21.521 --> 00:14:25.480
And you might think about how this is the same or different at Google as well.

224
00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.970
I've got a slide or two on each one of these.

225
00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:31.690
First one is a greater focus on local needs and customers.

226
00:14:31.691 --> 00:14:36.070
Now all companies do this,
but the Chinese are really focused on local customers.

227
00:14:36.071 --> 00:14:38.740
So on the left Chinese like soy products.

228
00:14:38.741 --> 00:14:42.760
So joy young makes a soy milk cooker on the right.

229
00:14:42.761 --> 00:14:45.160
That's myself with my coauthor.
We're at TCL,

230
00:14:45.161 --> 00:14:48.550
the world's largest consumer electronics company.

231
00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:54.110
They created a dual TV that two people can sit side by side watching two

232
00:14:54.111 --> 00:14:57.410
completely separate TV programs,
full screen.

233
00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:01.130
You just have to wear these dark glasses with the earpieces.

234
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:04.880
And my theory is that they designed this risk,
special Chinese need,

235
00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:07.730
which is the single child policy.

236
00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:11.810
The single child has grown up selfish and doesn't know how to share.

237
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:15.050
So when they get married,
they don't want to share TV programs either.

238
00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:17.780
So this product is designed to reduce the divorce rate in China.

239
00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:21.860
Apologies to the Chinese in this audience.
Oh,
and again,

240
00:15:21.861 --> 00:15:26.420
a typical Chinese innovation that is expensive to design and it's expensive to

241
00:15:26.421 --> 00:15:30.500
manufacturer,
but Chinese companies can afford to do that initially.
Number two,

242
00:15:30.501 --> 00:15:33.860
acceptance of good enough standards.
This was the first mass market.

243
00:15:33.861 --> 00:15:38.240
Chuck Car in China.
Chery Qq under 5,000 US dollars.

244
00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:41.420
It was famous for its thousands of defects,

245
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:45.530
but the Chinese accepted it and if this had happened in the west,

246
00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:49.940
the brand would be dead.
Cherry is still a respected brand in China.

247
00:15:49.941 --> 00:15:53.660
So the Chinese are more forgiving at least initially,
um,

248
00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:58.520
because they are still moving up the ladder,
but they didn't stop there.

249
00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:03.800
So by participating in global supply chains,
they learned.

250
00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:07.700
And furthermore,
because the competitive situation there is so fierce,

251
00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.340
they're like Alison Wonderland with a red queen.

252
00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:13.890
They've learned to run very fast to stay in the same place.
So,
um,

253
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:18.450
we now this concept of Red Queen Competition and this is what happens in China's

254
00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:23.420
where enhancing their capabilities.
Third one,

255
00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:28.100
incremental,
not radical innovations.
When I visited the head office of higher,

256
00:16:28.101 --> 00:16:30.890
they show me their new range Cassata uh,

257
00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:33.500
pretending not even to be Chinese called Cassata.

258
00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:37.760
The main innovation is that they've embedded for Roski crystals on the front of

259
00:16:37.761 --> 00:16:38.600
the cabinets.

260
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:43.700
So the Chinese are not embarrassed to do anything that will sell a product.

261
00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:47.450
Another example of this,
of incremental,
um,
broad,

262
00:16:47.451 --> 00:16:51.170
which starts out making gas.
Five air conditioners had,

263
00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.810
has now gone into prefabricated buildings.

264
00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:56.060
So I was in one of the buildings as was being built.

265
00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:59.900
Notice they sell it like they actually talk about Lego.

266
00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:01.010
You're going to buy this shape,

267
00:17:01.011 --> 00:17:05.390
that shape fully sealed air conditioning systems.

268
00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:07.580
When I stayed at their on campus hotel,

269
00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:11.000
you can open the windows and there were no controls.
The air conditioning.

270
00:17:11.001 --> 00:17:15.980
So a super energy efficient,
very fast to put up and much cheaper.

271
00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:20.780
So that's again,
typical Chinese innovation,
willingness to supply special needs.

272
00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.990
Um,
a TV company called high senses,

273
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.810
a big share of the TV market in Africa because in Africa many villages are too

274
00:17:26.811 --> 00:17:29.120
poor and can't afford only one TV set,

275
00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:32.720
which sometimes has to be shown outdoors for bigger audiences such as for a

276
00:17:32.721 --> 00:17:36.740
football match,
this means that you need to make the screen brighter.

277
00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:41.720
So high sense was willing to invest in a switch and the capability to make the

278
00:17:41.721 --> 00:17:44.900
screen brighter for outdoor use and again to manufacturing.

279
00:17:44.901 --> 00:17:49.410
So a typical Chinese innovation using large numbers staff.

280
00:17:49.411 --> 00:17:51.950
One of our students at CIBS,
um,

281
00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.660
started a security vehicle company.

282
00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:58.950
Now at first security vehicles seem to be the opposite of what suitable for the

283
00:17:58.951 --> 00:18:03.450
Chinese because the Chinese approach is to find a global product that same all

284
00:18:03.451 --> 00:18:06.090
over the world,
manufactured in large quantities,

285
00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:10.590
standardize at home and ship it around.
Well,
the problem security vehicles,

286
00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:12.390
high regulated market,

287
00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:15.750
so they're very different in different countries and small numbers,

288
00:18:15.751 --> 00:18:18.330
batch production.
So what the CEO did,

289
00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:20.310
<v 2>okay,</v>

290
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:24.270
<v 1>he assigned 100 engineers to spend a year studying needs all over the world.</v>

291
00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:29.430
At the end of the year they came back and said,
you know what,
for each component,

292
00:18:29.431 --> 00:18:32.940
the doors,
the windows,
the engines,
there are only about three or four variations.

293
00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:34.170
So what he does now,

294
00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:38.400
he manufactured the three or four variations of each component centrally and

295
00:18:38.401 --> 00:18:41.070
then ships them around the world for final assembly.

296
00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:46.340
So he is used large numbers of engineers to turn a multi local industry into a

297
00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:50.850
global industry.
Six,

298
00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:56.280
they worked their staff much harder.
They,
there's no work life balance in China.

299
00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:00.480
I love some of these comments from the CEO of Huawei.
Huawei.

300
00:19:00.481 --> 00:19:04.860
People are destined to work hard for a lifetime and to suffer more than others.

301
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:09.120
How's that for a recruiting slogan?
Um,

302
00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:12.330
and uh,
you know,

303
00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:16.170
bootcamp not much googling us and Chinese companies.

304
00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:21.450
The and the sleeping.
What's underneath the desk,
the sleeping role.

305
00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:22.760
So,
um,

306
00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:25.803
<v 2>yeah,</v>

307
00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:28.610
<v 1>seventh.
Oh,
by the way,
I,
and I know about,</v>

308
00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:29.613
<v 2>oh,</v>

309
00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:34.590
<v 1>I'm working hard.
Well,
I'll give you an example.
I have a fast trial and error,</v>

310
00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:37.140
very pragmatic.

311
00:19:37.141 --> 00:19:40.920
So don't say helping the leader talks about crossing the river by feeling the

312
00:19:40.921 --> 00:19:43.620
stones.
I'm the CEO of GM.

313
00:19:43.621 --> 00:19:47.400
China talks about failing and a government sponsored direction.
Electric vehicle.

314
00:19:47.401 --> 00:19:47.671
By the way,

315
00:19:47.671 --> 00:19:51.090
I predict that China of course will be the first country in the world to be

316
00:19:51.091 --> 00:19:52.710
serious about electric vehicles.

317
00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:56.220
They have the need because the air pollution problem,
um,

318
00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:59.880
they need a lot of vehicles and they're going to solve the chicken and egg

319
00:19:59.881 --> 00:20:02.670
problem of the charging stations because with the top down government,

320
00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:07.850
they are installing charging stations all over the country and they'll have

321
00:20:08.281 --> 00:20:13.110
fourth incentives to make people buy electric vehicles,
uh,
rather than,

322
00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:15.030
uh,
gasoline based ones.

323
00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:17.110
<v 2>MMM.</v>

324
00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:21.970
<v 1>Less formal,
faster processes.
We found that everything in China is faster.</v>

325
00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:23.170
Specific example,

326
00:20:23.171 --> 00:20:28.171
we're working with a major European multinational who bought a Chinese company

327
00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:33.520
in one of its sectors and we help them compare the length of the innovation

328
00:20:33.521 --> 00:20:36.280
process.
The European process was 24 months,

329
00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.890
the Chinese process was 12 months.

330
00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:44.490
So we then help them converge on an 18 month process to convince headquarters to

331
00:20:45.131 --> 00:20:47.140
allow them to go from 24 months to 18 months.

332
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:52.260
They couldn't go to 12 months because the Chinese took too many shortcuts or a

333
00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:54.250
10 cents.
Wechat,

334
00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:58.450
the gray release 1 million user experiments that they're able to do.
Again,

335
00:20:58.451 --> 00:21:03.010
the large numbers in China,
more intervention by the bosses.
You know,

336
00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:04.780
China's very boss oriented in the West.

337
00:21:04.781 --> 00:21:07.570
It's 90% process and 10 cent boss in China.

338
00:21:07.571 --> 00:21:11.920
It's 30 cent process and 70% uh,
boss,

339
00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:14.710
I'm on the right,
the CEO of broad,
he actually said to me,

340
00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:18.400
I'm responsible for 95% of the innovations at broad.

341
00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:20.800
That was an astonishing statement.
One,

342
00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:22.660
if it's true and two that he should say it,

343
00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:26.590
even Steve Jobs wouldn't have said that.
And I know Chinese bosses,

344
00:21:26.591 --> 00:21:28.960
my father was a Chinese boss.
He once said to me,
son,

345
00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:32.500
you should never contradict me,
especially when I'm wrong.

346
00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:36.133
<v 2>But</v>

347
00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:39.270
<v 1>interestingly,
for those of you who are not Chinese,
even for myself,</v>

348
00:21:39.271 --> 00:21:43.140
I'm from Hong Kong originally,
you may think of the Chinese being very obedient.

349
00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:46.890
Well,
Chinese are a billion only under some circumstances.

350
00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:51.630
Chinese are very obedient when they are observed by a superior,

351
00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:55.500
whether in a company or in a family setting where you know,

352
00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:59.760
in a family is always a restaurant of superiority,
you know,
your,
your parents,

353
00:21:59.761 --> 00:22:02.160
et cetera.
So,
um,

354
00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:05.430
when they're not supervise the Chinese very disobedient,

355
00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:08.430
hence the same shank out wonky un,

356
00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:10.140
the mountain is high and the emperor is far way.

357
00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:11.280
Now you can think about other cultures.

358
00:22:11.281 --> 00:22:13.470
There are some cultures where people are very obedient,

359
00:22:13.471 --> 00:22:16.080
whether or not they're observed.
He's the cultures,
for example,

360
00:22:16.081 --> 00:22:19.550
where people stand at a red light when there are no cars around.
Alright,

361
00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:23.460
class exams being Japan and Germany.
And there are other cultures,

362
00:22:23.461 --> 00:22:25.740
national cultures where people are very disobedient,

363
00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:29.550
whether or not they're observed.
And these are economic basket cases.

364
00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:32.640
I don't even need to name the countries,
you can figure them out for yourselves.

365
00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:35.400
But China is this on one diagonal.

366
00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:39.540
And indeed there are some other cultures that I've experienced where people are

367
00:22:39.541 --> 00:22:40.021
obedient.

368
00:22:40.021 --> 00:22:43.890
If you don't observe them too much and they become disobedient if they feel

369
00:22:43.891 --> 00:22:45.360
you're watching them too much.

370
00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:50.340
And I found that to be true of the Netherlands and other Scandinavian cultures,

371
00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:51.660
which,
which is Google.

372
00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:53.143
<v 2>Okay.</v>

373
00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:57.440
<v 1>Is it more like the Scandinavian culture where you'd like to be left alone?</v>

374
00:22:57.580 --> 00:23:00.080
Right.
There's the Chinese are the exact opposite.

375
00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:01.333
<v 2>Oh,</v>

376
00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:07.410
<v 1>close to the government.
Of course.
So Chinese companies benefit from having,
um,</v>

377
00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:12.780
a lot of government support.
So if we summarize this,

378
00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:14.370
um,

379
00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:19.370
China has a triple threat winning a trifecta there have the manufacturing

380
00:23:20.581 --> 00:23:24.930
capability,
which India doesn't have,
even though India is the second one,

381
00:23:24.931 --> 00:23:28.410
scientific and technical capacity,
China has more of that as well.

382
00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.450
So China now on the second point,

383
00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:35.700
can pretty much absorb most new technological and scientific development.
Yes.

384
00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:40.590
Are still behind the u s but there is a rapid catch up,

385
00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:43.350
particularly in digital,
for example,

386
00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:47.570
and a huge domestic market as a result of which they can start an improve at

387
00:23:47.571 --> 00:23:52.250
home before going global without necessarily bringing out worldclass products to

388
00:23:52.251 --> 00:23:56.120
start with.
And they can challenge any global incumbents.

389
00:23:56.390 --> 00:24:00.320
As I've shown in the case,
say of the commercial aircraft.

390
00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:03.560
Even Japan could not go up against Boeing and Airbus,

391
00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:06.500
but the Chinese state owned company is doing that.

392
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:08.750
This has happened only twice before in history,

393
00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:13.010
which countries have these advantages?
First of all,

394
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:15.440
it was the British empire,
not bruising on his own,

395
00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:17.960
but the entire empire give us the market.

396
00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:21.950
And then of course the United States after the Second World War.

397
00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:26.150
Now it is China's turn two of these three advantages.

398
00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:30.110
If we now look at it from the viewpoint of Western companies,

399
00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:33.380
we talk about why learn from China,

400
00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:36.590
because China is an emerging lead market.

401
00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:41.300
China's customers are young and extreme.
You know,
the concept of learning from,

402
00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:46.040
uh,
extreme users in China,
they'll try anything.
So,
for example,

403
00:24:46.041 --> 00:24:48.620
the way the Chinese learned to drink wine initially,

404
00:24:48.621 --> 00:24:52.820
the Chinese mixed wine with Coca Cola to get used to it.

405
00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:57.920
Um,
and tickling in food.
We see all kinds of innovations like that,

406
00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:01.970
but they're now increasingly sophisticated or even leading demand.

407
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.470
There are now a lot of very wealthy young Chinese and that you will see them

408
00:25:06.471 --> 00:25:09.920
around the streets of Boston as well.
The food,
her die,

409
00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:14.090
the second generation rich,
they're probably not working at Google,
but uh,

410
00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:18.940
they are the ones that are who,
who are buying the most expensive fashion.

411
00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:23.450
China is pressing needs for solutions such as inclusion sign to lead the world.

412
00:25:23.451 --> 00:25:28.280
Now in environmental solutions,
as I said before,

413
00:25:28.281 --> 00:25:30.290
they're more forgiving because most people,

414
00:25:30.291 --> 00:25:34.100
there are first generation or second generation consumers.

415
00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:38.030
So they'll try things they weren't necessarily don't have to buy what their

416
00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:40.220
parents bought.
And if you get something wrong,

417
00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:44.450
they'll move on and forget the market.

418
00:25:44.451 --> 00:25:47.960
Reasons among the world's biggest and most categories,
biggest for cars,

419
00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:52.040
biggest four trains,
biggest for airplanes and so on.

420
00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:56.480
And high diversity and differences even more so than in the United States

421
00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:59.250
because of the temperature differences,
climatic differences,
uh,

422
00:25:59.251 --> 00:26:03.040
specific examples.
Sun Yi,
the construction company said,
you know,

423
00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:08.050
Western construction company might have two or three models per product such as

424
00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:13.940
a crawler loaders,
but because of the diversity of soil conditions in China,

425
00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:17.540
and because of the so many different building projects,

426
00:26:17.541 --> 00:26:19.970
we'll have seven or eight different products instead.

427
00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:24.970
So more innovation because of the size of the Chinese market and niche in China

428
00:26:25.731 --> 00:26:28.250
can be a whole market in some western countries.

429
00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:32.480
And then reverse innovation when you invent something for the Chinese market,

430
00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:35.510
but it could be sent back to the developed world.

431
00:26:35.511 --> 00:26:38.950
So the most famous example of that is general electrics.
Um,

432
00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:41.960
ultra sound equipment.

433
00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:47.260
Initially $150,000 machine if it was too expensive and complicated for Chinese

434
00:26:47.551 --> 00:26:48.384
hospitals.

435
00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:53.480
So Ge put together a team to create a handheld device that was about $20,000.

436
00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.070
So succeeded in China,

437
00:26:56.190 --> 00:27:00.960
but it's been reversed back to the u s not to displace the $150,000 machine,

438
00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:05.610
but for new uses such as in doctors offices and in ambulances.

439
00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:11.110
Thirdly,
competitors,
very intense competitors,

440
00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:16.620
um,
breeding winners and they're assigned to go global as well.
So,

441
00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:19.080
uh,
competition and China's fiercely,

442
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:23.010
even then in the USA.

443
00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:27.760
So we summarize this by saying that um,

444
00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:33.600
Western companies must learn some capabilities from China.
The first one,

445
00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:35.850
bold experimentation and rapid iteration.

446
00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:41.010
This particular choose say for Europe where companies have come too
conservative,

447
00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:45.960
too much regulation,
they need to go to China to relearn bold experimentation.

448
00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:50.610
Secondly,
innovation through creative adaptation,

449
00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:55.530
adapting to create new products and new product categories,

450
00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:59.910
lean value.
I mean all companies focus on lean value,

451
00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:02.460
but even more so than China where it's more important.

452
00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:07.850
And the fist one that we were quite surprised by is that whilst a Japan wasn't

453
00:28:08.431 --> 00:28:12.900
much useful developing foreign managers because it's so ethnocentric,

454
00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:16.380
China's very open to foreign manager.
So if you send someone there,

455
00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:20.160
they get the chance to manage,
you know,
Chinese people,

456
00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:21.690
people from other countries.

457
00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:26.100
So we now have a saying to paraphrase a Frank Sinatra song,
Shanghai,

458
00:28:26.101 --> 00:28:29.490
Shanghai,
if you can manage there,
you can manage anywhere.

459
00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:35.770
So,
um,
I'll just go through a few brief slides on ecommerce.
Uh,

460
00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:40.910
China now has a bigger share of ie retail than anybody else in the world.

461
00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:47.810
And by 2020 is predicted to have 60% of global e-commerce because Chinese live

462
00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:52.920
on their mobile phones,
cell phones,

463
00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:58.980
much more than other countries.
I mean,
I think Koreans are more,

464
00:28:58.981 --> 00:29:03.390
but it's a much smaller country selected percentage of countries who've bought

465
00:29:03.391 --> 00:29:07.830
something in the past 12 months.
China,
68% were ahead.

466
00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:12.150
Uh,
I mean,
you know,
some of these statistics was,
it's your business,
but,
um,

467
00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:16.170
so I won't search in internet and mobile payments.
Um,

468
00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:19.110
third party mobile payments,
transaction value,

469
00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:22.310
incredible speed of growth of this.
Uh,

470
00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:26.520
some statistics on the types of products that they're buying.

471
00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:27.953
Um,

472
00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:34.310
and apple made a late entry into this and it's not doing that well compared with

473
00:29:35.491 --> 00:29:37.710
the incumbents.
Um,

474
00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:41.740
there's comparison here between Ali pay and we chats.
Um,

475
00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:47.780
uh,
WeChat is starting to catch up with Ali pay.
The Green Line below are,

476
00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:52.570
there's a comparison that you can look at.
Um,
and the last three sides,

477
00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:56.170
three emerging disruptions.
This was created by one of my colleagues.

478
00:29:56.171 --> 00:30:01.171
That's the rapid rise of connected on demand mobility and digital mobility.

479
00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:06.520
So digital mobility,
very important in China.
Again,

480
00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:10.210
some of you might expect because of the cities being so crowded,

481
00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:15.660
the link between hardware innovation and the economics of the digital ecosystem,

482
00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:20.200
China is more ready for this.
And then thirdly,
data driven insights.

483
00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:25.260
So Chinese service businesses really mine their data and their emerging service

484
00:30:27.281 --> 00:30:31.450
companies that are disrupting,
for example,
the,
uh,
automobile services.

485
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:35.740
So won't go through this,
but you can see that at least in mobility,

486
00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:40.570
a lot of things going on.
And you can study this at,
you,
let at your leisure.

487
00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:45.340
Um,
as you know,
most of you know,
Uber Lost Out in China,
right?

488
00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:48.240
Defeated in China by the,
uh,

489
00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:53.520
incumbent company and they ended up selling their state to the Chinese company

490
00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:58.450
in exchange for a share in the combined,
uh,

491
00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:00.880
business.
Uh,
one of the interesting,

492
00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:05.800
the stakes that Uber made was that it was possible for the drivers to cheat

493
00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:06.670
Uber.

494
00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:11.530
And because if they got a friend to book a ride and then the friend canceled the

495
00:31:11.531 --> 00:31:15.370
ride,
the driver's still got a percentage of the fee,

496
00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:17.320
which was really dumb of Uber.

497
00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:21.190
Because if in China there is a way for someone to cheat you,
they will.

498
00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:29.110
And the last slide,
you know,
the famous bat,
you may have heard that phrase,

499
00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:31.150
Baidu Alibaba 10 cent.

500
00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:36.420
This last slide is about the ecosystems that they have built up.

501
00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:42.010
So we have 15 to 20 minutes for questions.
Thank you for listening to this.

502
00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:50.640
So you were just talking about data mining.
I had a question about that.
Um,

503
00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:55.690
how did the privacy policies of the Chinese compared to Western countries,

504
00:31:56.260 --> 00:32:00.610
what's privacy ability that the child,
no,
no,

505
00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:02.700
no,
I'm serious.
Um,

506
00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:06.220
the Chinese word for privacy has negative connotations.

507
00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:10.180
It implies something a bit shameful that you want to hide.

508
00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:12.880
My wife was English learn this when you know,

509
00:32:12.881 --> 00:32:17.710
after getting married we went to Hong Kong and so that much less of a concept of

510
00:32:17.711 --> 00:32:20.970
privacy.
And of course the government,
uh,

511
00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:26.290
is entitle in China.
Governments entitled to look at any of your data.

512
00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:30.730
All right.
Um,
it's uh,
yeah,
just like Facebook.
Um,

513
00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:35.290
so privacy is much less,
uh,
well,
I mean,

514
00:32:35.291 --> 00:32:40.160
do you guys know about the new development in China of the Good Citizen Index?

515
00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:45.020
China's working to create a good citizen index,
definitely exact phrase,

516
00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:50.200
but based on your behavior and after that you will be blocked from buying

517
00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:56.900
airline tickets,
renting cars,
jobs,
et Cetera,

518
00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:00.950
because you have a bad citizen behavior rating.

519
00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:03.360
So no privacy.
Yeah.

520
00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:08.690
<v 3>I think I read somewhere that a part of the reason for China's expansion on like</v>

521
00:33:08.691 --> 00:33:11.870
mobile payments is because they don't have the existing infrastructure of credit

522
00:33:11.871 --> 00:33:12.704
cards.

523
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:17.380
Are there any other examples where trying to kind of skip to pass something into

524
00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:18.253
innovation?

525
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:23.020
<v 1>Um,
yeah,
I mean that,
that,
that's the,
that's the best example.
I'm not injured,</v>

526
00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:25.820
not as the credit card infrastructure.
That end of the banking infrastructure.

527
00:33:25.821 --> 00:33:29.720
So many Chinese,
very high percentage don't have bank accounts.
So they jumped,

528
00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:35.120
they jumped straight to mobile.
Um,
so that's a big advantage.
Uh,
uh,
for them.

529
00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:40.040
Um,
yeah,
I mean,
a related example of this is,
you know,

530
00:33:40.041 --> 00:33:43.460
bike rentals
in,

531
00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:45.380
I don't know how much the are in the u s but you know,

532
00:33:45.381 --> 00:33:49.160
in London and Paris we have these bike rental services,

533
00:33:49.161 --> 00:33:53.460
but they've docking stations.
So Chinese companies invented,
uh,

534
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:57.830
bikes without docking stations.
It's done entirely digitally.
It locks the bike.

535
00:33:58.290 --> 00:33:59.990
Uh,
so you can leave the bike anywhere.
Now,

536
00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:03.290
there've been huge problems because they then get these mountains of discarded

537
00:34:03.291 --> 00:34:06.920
bikes.
But in these,
again,
that's a different Chinese solution,
no infrastructure.

538
00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:11.510
So they come up with a new solution where you can take the bike anywhere.
But,

539
00:34:11.511 --> 00:34:14.270
so this is some of the examples of,
um,

540
00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:19.540
the leapfrogging because they don't have the previous infrastructure.

541
00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:21.400
Yep.

542
00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:24.910
<v 4>So your slide show kind of the ecosystem in China,</v>

543
00:34:24.970 --> 00:34:29.710
but there's a lot of technology that is forcibly not in China,

544
00:34:29.711 --> 00:34:30.790
for example,

545
00:34:31.450 --> 00:34:35.620
lots of restrictions on Google in China and we can't really have a presence due

546
00:34:35.621 --> 00:34:36.341
to the government.

547
00:34:36.341 --> 00:34:41.341
Have you looked at kind of the global usage by Chinese users of different

548
00:34:41.951 --> 00:34:42.940
technology sets?

549
00:34:43.370 --> 00:34:46.190
<v 1>Well,
I mean,
the reason why Google is blocked in China,</v>

550
00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:48.710
I mean there are two reasons why Google is blocked in China.

551
00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:53.060
One is the China wanted to protect its incumbent companies,
right?

552
00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:54.680
And then secondly,

553
00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:59.180
because Google was trying to protect the privacy of its users and China,

554
00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:03.700
you know,
it doesn't like that,
that that's the,
that's the main thing.
Now,
yes.
Um,

555
00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:05.420
not your exact question,

556
00:35:05.421 --> 00:35:10.421
but it is a problem for Chinese researchers because of the blocks and access to

557
00:35:11.061 --> 00:35:14.630
the Internet.
They cannot access everything they need to do.

558
00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:18.920
So one of the solutions they have is that Chinese companies will open a research

559
00:35:18.921 --> 00:35:23.510
office in Hong Kong where there are no blocks and then they do the Internet

560
00:35:23.511 --> 00:35:27.380
search that way,
uh,
for a while.
Um,
researchers,

561
00:35:27.381 --> 00:35:31.310
including business school professors,
um,
used,
um,
I just blanked out,
you know,

562
00:35:31.311 --> 00:35:35.330
this is a technology where you can get past this.
Now China's,
um,

563
00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:38.070
what does it call the,
yeah.
VPN.

564
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:42.960
But now China is blocking that again and it's illegal to have VPN.
So,
uh,

565
00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:43.601
I mean,

566
00:35:43.601 --> 00:35:46.110
they're astonished thing when the Internet started was that people said there's

567
00:35:46.111 --> 00:35:49.650
no way China can control this.
Uh,
but you know,

568
00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:54.090
I think there's up to a million people working on controlling the internet.

569
00:35:54.091 --> 00:35:58.290
So again,
this is use of the launch,
uh,
use of the large numbers.

570
00:35:58.590 --> 00:36:03.590
<v 5>So you mentioned that oftentimes Chinese students will come to the u s to get</v>

571
00:36:03.961 --> 00:36:06.810
educated and then there's incentives for them to go back to China.

572
00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:10.680
And I've heard,
you know,
uh,

573
00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:13.410
some people have the perspective like,

574
00:36:13.411 --> 00:36:18.411
why should we educate if they're just going to take education and go back to

575
00:36:19.531 --> 00:36:24.240
their country and not stay here and,
and,
you know,
contribute.
Um,

576
00:36:24.241 --> 00:36:27.420
what,
how would you respond to that and what are your,
what are your,

577
00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:28.950
what's your stance and thoughts on that?

578
00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:33.330
<v 1>Uh,
I mean that,
that's a complicated policy issue.
And,
um,</v>

579
00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:36.390
luckily I'm not a politician so I don't,
I don't know who's make these decisions.

580
00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:37.463
I mean,

581
00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:42.680
what we found through history is that you usually improve relations with a

582
00:36:42.961 --> 00:36:45.000
country.
If you educate the people,

583
00:36:45.001 --> 00:36:49.170
they go back with very positive views of the country.
Although interestingly,

584
00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:50.760
20 years ago,

585
00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:55.530
the Chinese would deliberately give very small living grants to the students.

586
00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:59.940
They wanted them to experience the worst of the USA,
not the best of the USA.

587
00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:05.070
They want them to live in the poorest places in the rest and not become too fond

588
00:37:05.071 --> 00:37:08.400
of the u s I mean,
the Chinese students are now rich,
you know,

589
00:37:08.401 --> 00:37:12.210
more of the ones that come out often have a wealthy parents.

590
00:37:12.211 --> 00:37:13.680
So we're not having sort of the,

591
00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:16.650
you often see these policy arguments out of the way around.

592
00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:21.150
Why are countries like the UK and the u s throwing out these units after we've

593
00:37:21.151 --> 00:37:25.890
invested in them and we want to keep them so you know,

594
00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:29.510
it,
it,
it's a,
it's a difficult solution.
I,

595
00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:34.080
Donald Trump hasn't gone after that yet.
I think of blocking Chinese students,

596
00:37:34.081 --> 00:37:35.430
but some who knows,

597
00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:40.590
<v 6>I think many people would argue that the longterm viability of China's,
um,</v>

598
00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:46.300
innovation is threatened by the increasing gap and social inequality.

599
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:51.500
Um,
and even,
you know,
those three huge companies,

600
00:37:51.501 --> 00:37:54.020
a sucking up all of the ecosystem,

601
00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:59.440
whereas perhaps others would argue that no Western economies have more room for

602
00:37:59.481 --> 00:38:02.150
innovation because a of less regulation.

603
00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:06.170
So I guess I could you comment on China's,
um,

604
00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:11.870
the future of China is a innovation and then also how you see,
um,
the uh,

605
00:38:11.871 --> 00:38:16.490
growing a growing divide and uh,

606
00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:18.110
the rich in China,
in the park in China,

607
00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:23.890
<v 1>the n the income and equality is triggered by what's called the who code system,</v>

608
00:38:24.930 --> 00:38:29.930
the residency system where you're not allowed to live in a city without getting

609
00:38:31.681 --> 00:38:35.190
a special permit.
And in general the city's block that,

610
00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:38.230
because once you're allowed,
then you can access all the services,

611
00:38:38.231 --> 00:38:42.140
medical services,
education,
et cetera.
And so a lot of the,
uh,

612
00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:46.930
lower level jobs in China I've done by people who are non residents who are

613
00:38:46.931 --> 00:38:50.200
their semi illegally and Sadie,
their children cannot go to school.

614
00:38:50.201 --> 00:38:53.920
So I have to leave the children back in the countryside be brought up by their

615
00:38:53.921 --> 00:38:55.280
grandparents.
So this,

616
00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:58.810
this is actually a massive problem that they literally don't know how to solve

617
00:38:58.811 --> 00:39:02.440
right now,
affecting maybe 100 million people,

618
00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:06.360
but I don't think that's necessarily going to,
uh,

619
00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:10.900
block innovation per se because the innovation is happening at an upper level,

620
00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:15.620
you know,
the scientists and the engineers.
Um,
secondly,
uh,

621
00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:20.590
you know,
the nature of China is that it is state driven innovation,

622
00:39:20.591 --> 00:39:22.540
but there are lots of private companies as well.

623
00:39:22.541 --> 00:39:27.010
So many of them as individual companies like Alibaba Royal,
which I mentioned,

624
00:39:27.011 --> 00:39:28.020
the flexible displacement,

625
00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:31.930
these are strictly private companies that are sort of benefiting from the

626
00:39:31.931 --> 00:39:36.100
Chinese innovation ecosystem.
And the question I haven't heard yet,

627
00:39:36.101 --> 00:39:41.020
but people often ask me is,
well,
you know,
if China's like controlling people,

628
00:39:41.021 --> 00:39:44.740
doesn't that,
uh,
stop innovation?
Well,
China

629
00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:50.800
doesn't care so long as you do not see to overthrow the communist party.

630
00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:53.770
If you're just innovating and making money,

631
00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:56.500
they're happy to support you.

632
00:39:56.501 --> 00:40:00.580
So I really don't necessarily see that as a problem or even by the dominance of

633
00:40:00.581 --> 00:40:05.200
a few companies.
I'm sure look at the history of the u s um,
many industries have,

634
00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:05.530
you know,

635
00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:10.530
like the automobile industry from the 1930s onwards had been dominated by two or

636
00:40:10.781 --> 00:40:15.130
three major companies.
In fact,
in China,

637
00:40:15.131 --> 00:40:19.930
the problem isn't too many monopolies.
It's too many competitors.

638
00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:24.130
We actually have coined a phrase in our next book with some different courses

639
00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:28.090
about swarm innovation.
We have an article coming out soon about that.

640
00:40:28.091 --> 00:40:30.160
There are swarms of Chinese competitors,

641
00:40:30.161 --> 00:40:31.900
so there aren't two future and its competitors.

642
00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:35.500
They're actually too many of them.
Uh,

643
00:40:35.501 --> 00:40:39.490
what do you think are some of the challenges that are facing China and the space

644
00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:43.810
and what are their leaders worrying about the most?
Well,

645
00:40:43.811 --> 00:40:48.220
if I just talk about innovation,
um,
education system is inferior.

646
00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:51.640
Um,
the education system top down traditional,

647
00:40:51.641 --> 00:40:54.040
of course that doesn't stimulate so much innovation.

648
00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:57.430
The Phd student will do the work of the professor,
et Cetera.

649
00:40:57.700 --> 00:40:59.680
So they're aware of this and guess what?

650
00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:01.930
They're paying the USA to help them solve the problem.

651
00:41:01.931 --> 00:41:06.931
So Duke University has a program and China to teach Chinese university lectures

652
00:41:07.661 --> 00:41:11.110
how to teach their students to be innovative.
Like the Americans.
So once again,

653
00:41:11.111 --> 00:41:14.660
America is teaching China how to compete with America.
So that,

654
00:41:14.830 --> 00:41:16.820
that is probably the biggest problem.
Um,

655
00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:21.140
a secondary problem is the Chinese language,
which also affects,
you know,

656
00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:23.830
the education system.
It's hard for other people to learn.

657
00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:27.070
It takes up so much time and brain space of children.

658
00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:30.550
I have my own personal prediction that mobile phones are helping to solve this

659
00:41:30.551 --> 00:41:35.150
problem because more and more now people are using the cell phones to spell for

660
00:41:35.151 --> 00:41:37.130
them.
Actually,
the older people are complaining about this,

661
00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:40.280
but I could see this being outsourced to cell phones.

662
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:42.980
<v 7>I want an area where the u s,
uh,</v>

663
00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:48.260
lags pretty severely behind the rest of the developed world is the healthcare

664
00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:49.711
system.

665
00:41:49.711 --> 00:41:54.240
And you've mentioned kind of in passing kind of the innovations in medical

666
00:41:54.241 --> 00:41:58.410
technology and healthcare in China.
And I'm wondering what can the,

667
00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:02.400
what can the US learn what and what can the u s take from that?

668
00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:07.480
<v 1>Um,
well,
China doesn't have a great healthcare system either.</v>

669
00:42:07.481 --> 00:42:12.040
It's surprisingly private.
Um,
people have to pay a lot.

670
00:42:12.041 --> 00:42:14.400
So the whole,
you know,
uh,

671
00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:18.900
state healthcare system has kind of withered away post,

672
00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:23.590
post the Communists,
um,
economic economic system.
So,

673
00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:27.520
you know,
you can get some services,
but for example,

674
00:42:27.521 --> 00:42:32.521
people have to pay doctors on the side to get any serious treatment.

675
00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:37.720
There's a terrible incentive in the doctors make money by selling medicines.

676
00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:41.050
So they overprescribe their medicines.
But again,
they may,

677
00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:45.710
going back to the technology part,
they may start to leapfrog this by you know,

678
00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:50.110
digital etc. And making it faster.

679
00:42:50.111 --> 00:42:53.920
I did have one experience myself.
I had to go through a health check.

680
00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:58.300
And again,
typical Chinese approach,
it was like a production line,

681
00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:00.280
whereas in the west I'd have gone,
you know,

682
00:43:00.281 --> 00:43:04.450
from floor to floor to the x Ray Department to the blood department and so on.

683
00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:08.500
Here it was a small building with a corridor,
first room,

684
00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:12.760
chest x rays,
second room,
blood tests,
third room I test.

685
00:43:12.761 --> 00:43:16.990
So it's like production line and the whole thing costs 100 US dollars.

686
00:43:16.991 --> 00:43:20.280
We've cost you $1,000 in the u s yeah.

687
00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:26.040
<v 8>Uh,
we all know China is,
uh,
uh,
had largest market in the ward.</v>

688
00:43:26.610 --> 00:43:30.540
And,
uh,
for many things,
so many Western company,

689
00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:36.050
how tried to enter the market without much success?

690
00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:42.020
What's your view on the top reasons why Western company off of the field in

691
00:43:43.741 --> 00:43:44.574
their market?

692
00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:50.310
<v 1>Good question,
but to be fair,
many companies have also succeeded.
Okay.
So,
um,</v>

693
00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:53.160
reasons for failure.
If you go up,

694
00:43:53.490 --> 00:43:55.790
if you go into a sector where the Chinese were,

695
00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:57.750
China's trying to develop its own competitors,

696
00:43:57.780 --> 00:44:01.050
they'll make life very difficult for you,
right?
Because they can put,

697
00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:04.890
they have hidden regulations they can pull out to make it difficult for you.

698
00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:08.760
So long as you are contributing something that China doesn't have,

699
00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:11.550
such as the western auto companies over the last 30 years,

700
00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:16.650
that happy to welcome you.
I mean,
it's,
I teach international business.

701
00:44:16.651 --> 00:44:17.484
It's the same principle.

702
00:44:17.490 --> 00:44:21.590
You've got to bring something to the country that they don't have.
So,
um,

703
00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:26.560
if you have that,
then they will welcome you and not make life,
uh,

704
00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:29.610
not make life too difficult then you know,

705
00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:34.410
partners for a long time you needed a Chinese partner somewhere.
Good partners.

706
00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:38.820
Uh,
some were bad.
Um,
there's a Chinese thing,
uh,

707
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.920
Tom Tran Jima,
same bed,
different dreams.
So,
you know,
um,

708
00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:47.640
so sometimes the partner was a nightmare,
so to speak,
following that analogy.

709
00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:50.850
And so that's a reason why it could go wrong.
But really,
you know,

710
00:44:50.970 --> 00:44:52.140
I think Google's case,

711
00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:57.300
you actually came right up against a essential policy of the government,

712
00:44:57.301 --> 00:45:02.301
which is the privacy issue and that's why you've been banned from China plus

713
00:45:02.731 --> 00:45:07.290
secondarily,
you know,
um,
other companies like Ebay,

714
00:45:07.890 --> 00:45:11.430
not a privacy issue.
Days wanted to protect the emerging,

715
00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:15.870
they're emerging companies.
That's why.

716
00:45:15.871 --> 00:45:19.830
So there are still opportunities but not in areas like that.

717
00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:21.473
So

718
00:45:21.490 --> 00:45:26.230
<v 9>one thing I've noticed about competition in China,
it's a,</v>

719
00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:30.730
it's a very free willing from form of competition ready.
If you have any idea,

720
00:45:30.731 --> 00:45:35.470
they will be a million competitors doing the same thing,
maybe better,
maybe not.

721
00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:37.080
Yeah.
Right.
Um,

722
00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:41.560
that's a very hard situation for external companies,
right?

723
00:45:41.561 --> 00:45:46.120
Because you know,
here in the US for example,
there is a strong law,
you know,

724
00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:50.980
feel of,
of,
of,
you know,
patents and Ip protection.
Right?

725
00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:55.510
Um,
so how,
how can anyone think of,
uh,
you know,

726
00:45:55.511 --> 00:45:59.020
getting into marketing in China in such a situation where there is a feeling

727
00:45:59.021 --> 00:46:01.270
that everybody will,
everything will be swollen,
right?

728
00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:05.950
<v 1>Yes.
Actually what Western companies are doing more and more is that instead of</v>

729
00:46:05.951 --> 00:46:10.540
selling products,
they're now selling a business models.
Um,

730
00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:15.600
so if we can embed the product in a business system that is much harder to

731
00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:21.550
imitate against,
um,
so,
uh,
you know,

732
00:46:21.551 --> 00:46:26.350
selling the service based on the product rather than the product itself or

733
00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:31.560
rapidly innovating to keep ahead of the imitators or having superior tech having

734
00:46:32.801 --> 00:46:33.880
superior technology,

735
00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:36.910
there are ways to protect your intellectual property so that it can't be,

736
00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:41.110
it can't be fully imitated.
Interestingly,
they also,

737
00:46:41.111 --> 00:46:44.370
companies are still ahead in China.

738
00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:48.680
This maybe a good item to finish with actually that,
um,

739
00:46:49.570 --> 00:46:52.570
as told by one of the German automotive companies,
they said,

740
00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:55.870
the reason we're still ahead is that in the west,

741
00:46:56.110 --> 00:47:01.110
the auto engineers grew up being taken to repair garages by their father or

742
00:47:03.521 --> 00:47:07.450
their grandfather.
So they've,
you know,
they've had this since childhood,

743
00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:09.640
these automotive engineers in China,

744
00:47:09.641 --> 00:47:12.040
the automotive engineers are first generation.

745
00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:17.070
They don't have this deep background and cars are this very complex combination

746
00:47:17.201 --> 00:47:22.201
of being a consumer product and being a highly engineered technical products.

747
00:47:22.421 --> 00:47:26.230
And actually they're going to have more difficulty in cars then they have say in

748
00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:31.210
commercial jet aircraft.
And in fact usually in,
cause,
you know,

749
00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:35.680
they don't particularly want the ultimate driving machine BMW.

750
00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:39.770
They want the ultimate mobile living room because that,
that's a different um,

751
00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:45.580
uh,
kind of experience that they,
uh,
that they want in China.
Um,
I'll give you,

752
00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:49.650
there's a great story about BMW,
which is that in China,
um,

753
00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:53.680
this will be my last comment.
There was a dating TV program in China,

754
00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:54.610
just to show you again,

755
00:47:54.611 --> 00:47:59.611
Chinese culture and young woman on the CRM and was asked by young man,

756
00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:02.350
he said,
you know,
I,
I'm not very rich,

757
00:48:02.351 --> 00:48:06.880
so would you go on a date with me just on a bicycle and her apply?

758
00:48:06.881 --> 00:48:08.050
She rejected him and said,

759
00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:13.560
I'd rather cry on the back of a BMW than smile on top of a bicycle.

760
00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:16.510
So that's Chinese culture.
Thank you very much.
