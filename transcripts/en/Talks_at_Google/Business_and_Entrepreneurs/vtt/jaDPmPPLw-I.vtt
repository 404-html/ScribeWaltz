1
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:05.450
Thanks so much guys.

2
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.530
I'll try and talk for about half an hour or 40 minutes or something,
uh,

3
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.790
about the origin of the project.

4
00:00:11.791 --> 00:00:14.190
I'll give it a little bit of context and explain.

5
00:00:14.191 --> 00:00:17.880
The first thing I suppose I need to kind of demystify is that very frequently

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
people assume that it's some kind of wish granting app where like miraculously

7
00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:27.570
you're going to kind of make stuff happen.
The APP doesn't do that.

8
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.720
It takes one positive action everyday in the direction of travel in terms of

9
00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:36.000
what it is that people have articulated.
But I'll specify that a little bit more.

10
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.150
And then as I say it,
talk about the history of the project,
where it came from,

11
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.300
exemplify some of the actions that the app takes and then talk a little bit

12
00:00:44.371 --> 00:00:48.780
about what the conceivable future of it might look like.
And then as I say,

13
00:00:48.781 --> 00:00:51.300
I hope at the end we'll have time for questions.

14
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.200
I've always had got a caveat this talk by saying that we've had a couple of

15
00:00:55.201 --> 00:00:59.190
technical issues with regards to setting up the slides.
So if at some point,
uh,

16
00:00:59.191 --> 00:01:00.150
the screen goes dark,

17
00:01:00.151 --> 00:01:02.580
then you'll have to forgive me what I'm trying to remember how to reboot it.

18
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.780
So just a tiny bit about my background.

19
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.120
I've always worked in the kind of media sector,

20
00:01:09.121 --> 00:01:11.820
so it mainly in television and uh,

21
00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:16.320
for a brief spell for a couple of years at the radio station Kiss FM,

22
00:01:16.321 --> 00:01:20.400
I've worked for a bunch of advertising agencies for Channel Four and also comedy

23
00:01:20.401 --> 00:01:23.770
central,
the Viacom owned brand.
Uh,

24
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.170
and I about probably four years ago,

25
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.170
I just turned 40,
a classic midlife crisis,

26
00:01:31.171 --> 00:01:34.710
started thinking and I've had this idea and I thought if I don't now do

27
00:01:34.711 --> 00:01:37.470
something about putting it into the world and making it happen,

28
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.320
maybe it will never kind of manifest.

29
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.380
And there were three principal kind of creative influences that I had,

30
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.090
not necessarily things that I was utterly obsessed with,

31
00:01:51.091 --> 00:01:53.850
but they're just things that are caught my attention and had maybe bought a book

32
00:01:53.851 --> 00:01:58.040
or looked into them a little bit further.
The first of these was a,
uh,

33
00:01:58.041 --> 00:02:01.680
a project called post secret.
I don't know whether anyone's heard of this,

34
00:02:01.681 --> 00:02:04.290
but a guy in the states called Frank Warren,

35
00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:06.810
not to be confused with the English boxing promoter,

36
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.080
ours people to hand make a postcard on which they articulated something that

37
00:02:12.571 --> 00:02:17.571
they'd never told another living soul and to anonymously send it to him.

38
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.740
And he received literally hundreds of thousands of postcards.
This guy,

39
00:02:22.741 --> 00:02:26.880
he's done six books now,
he does exhibitions,
speaking tours.

40
00:02:26.881 --> 00:02:31.881
What started as a kind of a reasonably understated and scruffy tumbler blog

41
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.420
became this phenomenon,
and I was interested,

42
00:02:36.421 --> 00:02:41.421
I suppose at the little snapshots that this gave into people's lives and there

43
00:02:43.501 --> 00:02:44.400
was no backstory,

44
00:02:44.401 --> 00:02:47.700
although though often it's possible to kind of imagine what it might have been

45
00:02:47.701 --> 00:02:49.320
and he didn't really know what happened next,

46
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.560
but just this idea of a brief glimpse into someone's kind of soul with something

47
00:02:55.201 --> 00:02:59.080
that I found really kind of engaging in terms of the authenticity of it,

48
00:02:59.081 --> 00:03:02.980
I suppose super unpolished,
very authentic,
as I say,

49
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.770
and something which kind of resonated very frequently.

50
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.780
Kind of melancholic as well.
You know,

51
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.470
I smile all the time so that no one knows how sad and lonely I really am.

52
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.590
The type of stuff that in this increasingly kind of polished world of social

53
00:03:17.501 --> 00:03:20.940
media,
we would be unlikely to post,
say on Instagram or something like that.

54
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.990
Something that felt like because of the anonymity,

55
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
people's identities weren't associated with it.

56
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.240
It felt like it was coming from a kind of truer place to me.

57
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.820
There was another thing that I really,
really did like,
and this,

58
00:03:30.821 --> 00:03:34.790
I did buy all the books are called found magazine and this,
uh,

59
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.830
again was a kind of a pretty understated project started by a guy called Dave

60
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.720
Rothbart and he just produced a compendium of notes that either people sent him

61
00:03:45.881 --> 00:03:48.250
or that he found and that was it.
And again,

62
00:03:48.251 --> 00:03:53.251
it provides a similar kind of a little snapshot into people's lives.

63
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.380
And there was something super fascinating about it and they were simultaneously

64
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.200
disposable.
Literally,
they were trash that he found in the street.

65
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.090
But also I thought,
ah,
kind of potent and really interesting.

66
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.360
Uh,
call me dad died.
I thought that,
you know,

67
00:04:10.361 --> 00:04:14.020
I wonder what's kind of going on there,
what's the nature of that relationship?

68
00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:16.530
This one here,
I really like Mario.
I fucking hate you.

69
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:20.380
You said to me that you have worked and why is your car here at her place or a

70
00:04:20.381 --> 00:04:24.470
fucking lie?
I hate you.
I fucking hate you,
amber pos page me later.
So,

71
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.720
so those kinds of things where as I say,

72
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.770
it's told you everything about someone and nothing about someone simultaneously.

73
00:04:32.771 --> 00:04:35.860
And I was really into that.
Uh,
also,

74
00:04:35.861 --> 00:04:38.680
and this is become a tiny bit of a kind of millennial cliche.

75
00:04:38.681 --> 00:04:42.010
You could argue it has maybe 15 million followers on Facebook now.

76
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.800
This humans of New York project that you'll be familiar with,

77
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.110
photographer called Brandon Stanton,

78
00:04:47.111 --> 00:04:52.111
just meeting people in New York and taking photos of them and hearing what it is

79
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.630
that they had to say about their lives in a paragraph or two.

80
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.800
And there's some extraordinary kind of wisdom contained therein.
There's,

81
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.680
there's some amazing pathos contained there in the,

82
00:05:05.681 --> 00:05:09.100
some super inspiring stuff as well.
But again,

83
00:05:09.101 --> 00:05:11.360
I guess what links these three projects to,
as I say,

84
00:05:11.361 --> 00:05:16.000
I was kind of preoccupied with which they just provided this limited little

85
00:05:16.001 --> 00:05:19.510
snapshot,
almost like a Polaroid,
as I say,
of someone's soul.

86
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.040
So I was thinking about this kind of concept for a while.

87
00:05:22.041 --> 00:05:26.320
And then I was also looking,
I suppose without doing some wholesale like a,

88
00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.030
you know,
competitive analysis of what the marketplace looked like.

89
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.820
I was seeing the kind of apps that were out there at the time.

90
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.120
There were a few anonymous ones,
whisper hub,

91
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.470
which is still quite a big deal at one called secret,

92
00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:43.170
which has kind of segwayed into being something else.
Uh,
and another,
uh,
APP,

93
00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.750
which was super popular for awhile on college campuses in the states called Yik

94
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.700
Yak,
all of which were anonymous apps,
which again,

95
00:05:48.701 --> 00:05:51.700
allow people within your network to say something,

96
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.290
which they probably wouldn't say,
have they,
you know,

97
00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.380
were they in a position to have to associate their own identity with it?

98
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.020
So I thought,
you know,

99
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:05.050
let's create an anonymous place where people can post the things they most want

100
00:06:05.841 --> 00:06:08.900
in the world,
whatever those things may be.

101
00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:12.560
And that was my initial iteration of the idea.
So I'm the,
uh,

102
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:17.590
reasonable devoted of the lean startup methodology and a lot of the Paul Graham

103
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.380
essays,
you know,
the a y Combinator founder,
uh,

104
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:26.590
and what I didn't do was to go out and try and raise VC capital or anything like

105
00:06:26.931 --> 00:06:29.150
that.
I did it super scruffy,
low costs,

106
00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:32.570
iteration of this primary idea and its sole function,

107
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.990
which just for people to articulate in a hundred characters or less,
as I say,

108
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.840
the things that they most wanted,
whatever those things may be.

109
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:44.130
And I kind of thought when I was like building it with the developer guy,
uh,

110
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.460
well maybe that'll just be like what it is,
you know.

111
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.030
But when I looked at it and we tried a little bit of a Beta test and I've got

112
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.710
some user feedback,

113
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.630
paradoxically something which was designed to be a little inspiring,

114
00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:01.840
ended up feeling slightly kind of flat and listless because what was happening

115
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:06.170
was there were people,
as I say,
we're articulating their hopes,
dreams,
desires,

116
00:07:06.171 --> 00:07:10.610
aspirations.
But if nothing was happening as a consequence,

117
00:07:10.611 --> 00:07:14.300
it ended up feeling like a slightly deserted kind of Pinterest board where

118
00:07:14.301 --> 00:07:16.010
people are like put this stuff.

119
00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:20.540
But it just was a repository for half kind of forgotten dreams and 40

120
00:07:20.541 --> 00:07:22.640
[inaudible] ambition,
you know?
So it ended up,
as I say,

121
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:27.560
feeling a little bit kind of tired and it's strangely a slightly depressing

122
00:07:27.561 --> 00:07:30.950
place to hang out.
So the thing that I suppose catalyzed it,

123
00:07:30.951 --> 00:07:35.480
and I wouldn't want to over exaggerate the extent of the arts success of the

124
00:07:35.481 --> 00:07:38.600
project.
It's not like it's some snapchat style phenomena,

125
00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:43.730
but the thing that people seem to kind of gravitate towards or that galvanized

126
00:07:43.731 --> 00:07:48.731
it was this idea of taking meaningful real world action.

127
00:07:49.191 --> 00:07:52.890
So I'm a,
I'm really very interested in technology but equivalent,

128
00:07:52.891 --> 00:07:54.080
the interested as we all are,

129
00:07:54.081 --> 00:07:57.410
I'm sure about the kinds of things that happen away from keyboard.

130
00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:01.930
So I thought could you do an interesting thing?
And I was,
you know,
uh,

131
00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:07.600
quite into these projects where the APP itself was like a nicely designed thing.

132
00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:10.850
Take Airbnb for example,
that's a cool APP.

133
00:08:10.851 --> 00:08:14.410
You could design it in loads of different ways.
Website looks nice,
uh,

134
00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:17.540
endlessly kind of changed an iterated to try and perfect it.

135
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:21.290
But the amazing thing about airbnb was the fact that millions of people were

136
00:08:21.291 --> 00:08:24.320
having these extraordinary weekends where they met someone who became a friend

137
00:08:24.321 --> 00:08:27.530
in a foreign city.
That was really what the user experience was.

138
00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.710
That was the real kind of Ui right there.
So I thought,

139
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:36.310
is there something cool that you could do to bring these aspirations a little

140
00:08:36.531 --> 00:08:40.460
bit closer?
Not to miraculously,
like I said at the start of the presentation,

141
00:08:40.461 --> 00:08:41.450
and as it says up here,

142
00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:46.660
not granting wishes in the way that you might see in a kind of children's a

143
00:08:46.851 --> 00:08:49.190
fairy story or a small seed Disney thing.

144
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:54.430
But just I suppose I'd hearing to the Credo that any action is better,

145
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:55.823
the nun,

146
00:08:55.830 --> 00:09:00.630
is there something that we can do about each of these wishes that makes them a

147
00:09:00.631 --> 00:09:02.220
three dimensional real thing,

148
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.490
a couple of steps closer to that professor aspiration rather than it just

149
00:09:05.491 --> 00:09:09.150
hanging around on the Internet being like another tweet or something and that

150
00:09:09.151 --> 00:09:13.440
was all the kind of thinking was so the site's actions are unique and freshly

151
00:09:13.441 --> 00:09:18.420
created every day and they can be anything depending on the nature of the wish.

152
00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:22.690
And you see like those three projects that I was talking about at the start you

153
00:09:22.691 --> 00:09:26.250
see things which are happy or sad or melancholic are uplifting.

154
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:30.060
The interesting thing about it or one of the interesting things that I found

155
00:09:30.061 --> 00:09:35.061
about it is that no two wishes are kind of alike and a wish,

156
00:09:35.221 --> 00:09:39.240
which is super kind of sad and heartbreaking,

157
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:43.080
seems to sit quite happily alongside another which,
which might be as I say,

158
00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.330
uplifting or euphoric in some way.

159
00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:48.810
So there were only a few guidelines which people have been pretty good at

160
00:09:48.811 --> 00:09:51.620
adhering to of the many thousands of wishlist.

161
00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:54.090
There are on the site have probably had to delete lights six.

162
00:09:54.091 --> 00:09:58.380
I think most of them were from the same person.
Uh,
and as it says here,

163
00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:02.610
basically,
I don't know how well you can read that.
Don't be lame.
You know,
it's,

164
00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:06.420
it's not that funny to kind of write,
oh I wish I could fly or whatever.

165
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.470
Don't be greedy.
So say I wish I had,
you know,
a free Rolex or whatever,

166
00:10:10.471 --> 00:10:11.940
that's not going to get any traction.

167
00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:16.200
And the way in which the site was working in terms of its Ui is that the wish

168
00:10:16.201 --> 00:10:19.710
that was most up voted each day.
The wish that came to the top of the list,

169
00:10:19.711 --> 00:10:20.910
the top of the chart as it were,

170
00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:23.670
that was the one that was going to have some action taken against it.

171
00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:24.781
Don't be a dick.

172
00:10:24.781 --> 00:10:28.380
So any form of behavior that advocates kind of breaking the law or some kind of

173
00:10:28.381 --> 00:10:31.530
racial hatred or something like that,
that was just going to get taken down.

174
00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:35.040
Don't be gross to be too selfish,
et Cetera,
et cetera.
Ps,

175
00:10:35.041 --> 00:10:37.740
we've heard the thing about unlimited wishes loads.
It's hilarious.

176
00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:42.210
So people seem to kind of understand it self governed pretty well,
the site.

177
00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:44.040
And if occasionally there is something weird on there,

178
00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:46.170
some little typically email me and say,
oh you know,

179
00:10:46.171 --> 00:10:48.410
you should check out this wish.
It looks a bit odd.
But as I said,

180
00:10:48.411 --> 00:10:51.240
they were all completely anonymous,
a 100 characters or less.

181
00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:53.880
And the wish that got to the top everyday at six o'clock,

182
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.640
that was the one that had action taken against it.

183
00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:01.710
So let me give you some examples of the actions that the APP takes.

184
00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:06.330
Uh,
so the quality of Trump's stuff at the moment for obvious reasons.

185
00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.930
So I think the,
which was,
I wish that Donald Trump wasn't such a deck,

186
00:11:09.931 --> 00:11:12.020
but I've had variants of that loads of times.

187
00:11:12.021 --> 00:11:13.980
And then that's a thought that probably everyone has had.

188
00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:18.390
What you get from this project is that I actually wrote a letter to him at the

189
00:11:18.391 --> 00:11:20.250
Trump foundation where that he never wrote back to me.

190
00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:21.630
I don't know why he's must be busy,

191
00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:27.200
but it's just a kind of slightly Sarky why did you once tweet tiny children are

192
00:11:28.211 --> 00:11:31.140
not horses?
Everyone knows that already.
What were you thinking when you said,

193
00:11:31.141 --> 00:11:33.330
if a banker,
when my daughter,
perhaps I'd be dating her,

194
00:11:33.331 --> 00:11:35.370
can you not see that's kind of gross,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

195
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:39.030
And that stuff in terms of growing the site goes over pretty well on Twitter

196
00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:43.410
about when Twitter was still like a thing to dig at your competitor there.
Uh,

197
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:48.300
and so sometimes I'll do something in the spirit of the wish itself.

198
00:11:48.301 --> 00:11:51.420
So that's clearly a tongue in cheek,
slightly ironic wish.

199
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.580
And so the response is equivalent,
um,

200
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:59.410
when people wished there's call of stuff about,
uh,
the elderly,
you know,

201
00:11:59.411 --> 00:12:03.490
there's a phenomena in this country and to certain extent in the states where

202
00:12:03.491 --> 00:12:06.550
there's an epidemic of loneliness amongst old people in this country.

203
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:09.850
And very frequently,
I forget what the statistic is,

204
00:12:09.851 --> 00:12:13.450
but it's a high percentage of people who are surprisingly high.

205
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:18.630
Percentage of people will go like two weeks without having any form of human

206
00:12:18.671 --> 00:12:21.210
interaction beyond the most prosaic one with the shopkeeper,

207
00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:24.670
a postman or something.
So when people are wished for a treat for the elderly,

208
00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:27.580
myself and my girlfriend,
thank you very much for helping me with that.

209
00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:31.690
Visited an old people's home over the Easter weekend and festoon that with

210
00:12:31.691 --> 00:12:35.740
hundreds of daffodils and chocolate eggs when people wish that their commute

211
00:12:35.741 --> 00:12:36.700
wasn't so boring.

212
00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:41.850
I changed the signage on the tube so it's very easy to download as I discovered

213
00:12:42.041 --> 00:12:47.041
the London Underground type face and I just adjusted the signs to give people a

214
00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.840
bit of a smile on their way to work.
So as I say,

215
00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:54.700
it's one thing every day and I don't like go into a thing where I say,
right,

216
00:12:54.701 --> 00:12:56.320
I'm going to do every tube chain or whatever.

217
00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:59.380
It's what you're buying and inverted commerce,
although it's free,

218
00:12:59.381 --> 00:13:04.381
what you're buying into is 24 hours worth of resourceful,

219
00:13:04.511 --> 00:13:07.090
industrious,
hopefully creative kind of action.

220
00:13:07.091 --> 00:13:11.410
But everything starts and ends within that 24 hour period.
I never say,
oh,

221
00:13:11.411 --> 00:13:14.470
I'll get back to you in three weeks once I've got a thousand signatures or

222
00:13:14.471 --> 00:13:15.090
something.

223
00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:20.090
And this was a wish from a woman in Scotland who's daughter had been badly

224
00:13:20.201 --> 00:13:21.760
bullied in secondary school.

225
00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:26.860
So she came down to London and we arranged a really nice day out for her.

226
00:13:26.861 --> 00:13:28.480
I use we in the royal sense.

227
00:13:28.481 --> 00:13:32.500
I mean I arranged a day doubt for her and she went,

228
00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:33.761
what does she do?

229
00:13:33.761 --> 00:13:38.710
We met for breakfast and then she went to the royal ballet and had a kind of

230
00:13:38.711 --> 00:13:40.690
backstage tour there.
She was really interested,

231
00:13:40.691 --> 00:13:44.350
like a lot of teenagers are in a potential career in the performing arts.

232
00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:48.820
So she met a ballet dancer and had a kind of back stage tour there and then the

233
00:13:48.821 --> 00:13:51.880
ballet dancer gave her her love ballet shoes,
which was really sweet.

234
00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:55.720
Then she went to pineapple dance studios and met with someone who had been a

235
00:13:55.721 --> 00:13:59.230
backing dancer for like one direction and lots of people and it gave her a kind

236
00:13:59.231 --> 00:14:00.340
of dance class.

237
00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:04.960
Then she went to meet a friend of mine who I knew from my time at Kiss FM,

238
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:07.690
a WHO's a super nice,
very,

239
00:14:07.691 --> 00:14:12.630
very sweet charismatic woman who uh,
is uh,
one of the DJ's.
She does the,
uh,

240
00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:15.430
afternoon drive time kind of show.

241
00:14:15.431 --> 00:14:18.760
And so she had a cup of coffee with her and talked to her about this experience

242
00:14:18.761 --> 00:14:20.470
that she was having in school.

243
00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:26.190
And then in the evening she went to a performance of Mama Mia and she wore all

244
00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:32.380
black and like was sitting at the side of the stage with the stage manager and

245
00:14:32.381 --> 00:14:34.630
saw how that kind of whole show was put together.

246
00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:36.910
And a couple of those things where people that I knew already,

247
00:14:36.911 --> 00:14:40.090
but a couple of those things where people,
and this happens quite a lot,

248
00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:44.230
who were already on the site or four of those people who had been bullied

249
00:14:44.231 --> 00:14:46.840
themselves when they were little and they said,
I see you've got this.

250
00:14:46.841 --> 00:14:49.810
Which coming,
uh,
up about bullying?
Well,
I would be really happy.

251
00:14:49.811 --> 00:14:52.160
I'm an actress now,
you know,
she should come down to Mamma Mia,

252
00:14:52.161 --> 00:14:55.590
will this person at the Royal Opera House can help in this particular way with

253
00:14:55.591 --> 00:14:56.870
the ballet,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

254
00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:00.980
So very frequently I'll be coordinating something,

255
00:15:00.981 --> 00:15:04.400
which the community itself is volunteering in terms of what it is that they

256
00:15:04.401 --> 00:15:08.150
might like to do to help,
which is kind of Nice.
Um,
this was,

257
00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:11.210
you remember that a while back where that Boko Haram,

258
00:15:11.211 --> 00:15:15.380
the Islamic fundamentalist group in northern Nigeria kidnap those school girls,

259
00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:17.520
some of whom have now been released.
Uh,

260
00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:21.610
and so I went to the Nigerian embassy,
uh,

261
00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:26.720
first thing in the morning before it opened and had written the night before,
uh,

262
00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:30.890
the name of each of their missing girls on a post it note and then covered that

263
00:15:30.891 --> 00:15:34.370
doors with that as a kind of gesture.
And very frequently,
as I say,

264
00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:38.420
it is a gesture.
So I'm not claiming that as a consequence of me doing that.

265
00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:40.130
The guards were miraculously recovered.

266
00:15:40.131 --> 00:15:42.550
It's just an articulation of visualization,

267
00:15:42.551 --> 00:15:47.210
a three d iteration of that which would otherwise just be a bit of social media

268
00:15:47.211 --> 00:15:51.950
kind of Ephemera,
I suppose.
Um,
you know who I mean by Katie Hopkins.

269
00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:54.170
It's like a female piers Morgan.

270
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:56.870
Someone wished that she would sign a gagging order.

271
00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:59.030
And by a very strange coincidence,

272
00:15:59.031 --> 00:16:01.670
I was reading a magazine and the week before this,

273
00:16:01.671 --> 00:16:05.450
which came to the top and I saw that she was due to do a speaking event.

274
00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:08.090
She was going to be in some debate about Brexit or something.

275
00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:12.440
And so I went along to that debate and a folded over a piece of paper,

276
00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:15.830
got her to sign the bottom here with her lame signature,

277
00:16:15.831 --> 00:16:17.420
which adds to profess it,
little hearts.

278
00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:21.020
And little did she know that clearly it wasn't legally binding,

279
00:16:21.021 --> 00:16:24.110
it was just like a joke,
but she said,
ah,
you know,
in fact,
I'm sorry,

280
00:16:24.111 --> 00:16:25.790
an embarrassed for pretty much everything I've ever done.

281
00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.950
I'll go now that only works if you know who she is,

282
00:16:27.951 --> 00:16:31.190
but she's a fairly reprehensible human being.
Uh,

283
00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:35.090
very frequently they are about things,
social ills that we can see around us,

284
00:16:35.091 --> 00:16:38.840
the wishes.
So if people wish for help for the homeless are just go out.
Again,

285
00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:42.500
not miraculously claiming to rid the world of the,
uh,
you know,

286
00:16:42.501 --> 00:16:46.160
problem that it has with homelessness,
but just,
you know,

287
00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:48.560
visit half a dozen people,
take them some sleeping bags,

288
00:16:48.561 --> 00:16:51.710
a cup of coffee sandwiches or lunch time,
whatever it may be.
Uh,

289
00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:53.480
when people wish for more love in the world,

290
00:16:53.481 --> 00:16:55.820
that quite often they're quite abstract things like that,

291
00:16:55.821 --> 00:16:59.720
which as an expression of something or a nice sentiment,

292
00:16:59.721 --> 00:17:00.740
but they're kind of woolly.

293
00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:05.180
So I'll try and do something kind of crisp and specific with regards to it.
So,

294
00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:09.230
uh,
on this occasion people wish for more love in the world and then distributed

295
00:17:09.231 --> 00:17:11.060
flowers all over London.
And so people can take them back,

296
00:17:11.061 --> 00:17:13.040
give them to their boyfriend,
girlfriend,
partner,
whatever,

297
00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:16.730
tell them how much they loved them.
That was pretty popular.
There was this thing,

298
00:17:16.731 --> 00:17:18.050
I wasn't aware of this phenomena,

299
00:17:18.051 --> 00:17:22.250
but this is a very popular wish where people felt that when they went to an art

300
00:17:22.251 --> 00:17:25.190
market department store,
Harrods or Selfridges or whatever,

301
00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:29.390
they were frequently condescended to by people who worked on makeup counters.

302
00:17:29.391 --> 00:17:32.000
I didn't know that that was a thing,
but apparently it was,
lots of people said,

303
00:17:32.001 --> 00:17:35.780
oh yeah,
that happens to me the whole time.
So I put this sign in Harrods.

304
00:17:35.781 --> 00:17:38.810
Customers should be advised that there may be subject to weathering looks and

305
00:17:38.811 --> 00:17:40.940
occasional condescending comments,
which rust,

306
00:17:40.941 --> 00:17:44.190
this will not detract from your shopping experience.
Uh,

307
00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.430
this again was the community helping.

308
00:17:46.431 --> 00:17:49.650
So this was a really sick boy in Florida who's just wanted to get a lot of

309
00:17:49.651 --> 00:17:54.510
birthday cards and so crowd which members sent them to him.
Uh,

310
00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:58.110
this was the thing.
Remember this is another arcane bit of tax law,

311
00:17:58.111 --> 00:18:01.290
actually think it has been EU legislation rather than something that was maybe

312
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:03.990
under all kinds of ages in the UK.

313
00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.710
But Feminine Hygiene Products were taxed as a luxury item,

314
00:18:07.711 --> 00:18:11.040
which was obviously insane.
And there was quite a lot of stuff online about that.

315
00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:15.240
So I sent this Tampon in this luxury packaging to the chancellor of the

316
00:18:15.241 --> 00:18:17.540
exchequer with the sarcastic,
uh,

317
00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:20.370
this was people wishing there was less bigotry of the world.
So I sent,

318
00:18:20.371 --> 00:18:23.070
have you ever seen that website ship your enemies glitter?

319
00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:26.340
It was like a big deal a couple of years ago,
you know,

320
00:18:26.341 --> 00:18:28.950
cause glitter is a fucking nightmare,
isn't it?
If you open an envelope.

321
00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:34.410
So I sent this I've uh,
EDL or something,

322
00:18:34.411 --> 00:18:38.250
it was called like a horrible kind of,
you know,
far right extremist groups.

323
00:18:38.251 --> 00:18:39.490
So I sent the leader of that.

324
00:18:39.491 --> 00:18:41.580
I wanted to think of the kind of campus thing I could do.

325
00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:44.130
So I had a vision whether or not there's manifest,
I don't know,

326
00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:47.670
sometimes it would be nice to see to be there when this stuff happens,

327
00:18:47.671 --> 00:18:50.190
but I had a vision of this guy getting covered in glitter and reading this,

328
00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:52.050
sorry.
No,
sorry.
No.
Um,

329
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:55.350
when someone wished for a half decent boyfriend,

330
00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:59.850
I put up a kind of missing sign,
a presumed nonexistent,

331
00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:03.990
uh,
just not a date basically.
And,
and again,

332
00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:07.520
what happens with these things is you only need to put out one side or is it

333
00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:08.460
actually put up more than that?

334
00:19:08.461 --> 00:19:11.550
But I think I put up less than half a dozen signs and then someone sees it,

335
00:19:11.551 --> 00:19:13.890
it takes a photo of it.
And by the end of the day,

336
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:17.130
I had a load of people getting in touch saying either I am that boyfriend.

337
00:19:17.131 --> 00:19:18.150
So if you find someone,

338
00:19:18.151 --> 00:19:22.260
then I am the candidate who ticks all this kind of criteria.
I have my own teeth,

339
00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:25.670
positive bank balance,
et Cetera,
et cetera.
Uh,
awesome.
Uh,

340
00:19:25.671 --> 00:19:28.530
or a lot of people saying that if you do find this mythological man who I'm

341
00:19:28.531 --> 00:19:32.030
convinced doesn't actually exist,
then let me know.
Cause I'd love to have dates,

342
00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:35.190
but I would probably put together seven or eight couples.
And again,

343
00:19:35.191 --> 00:19:38.220
I don't follow that narrative.
I just say,
look,
I'll introduce you guys.

344
00:19:38.221 --> 00:19:42.730
Hope you have a good time.
Basically,
um,
when people wish that Jay,

345
00:19:42.731 --> 00:19:45.510
this is not a political thing by the way,
but you know,

346
00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:49.560
Jeremy Corbyn was getting quite little shit for looking scruffy and he did look

347
00:19:49.561 --> 00:19:53.280
pretty bad.
I thought he did look kind of scruffy.
And David Cameron,

348
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:57.270
Denise say something to a PM qs about my mother would be ashamed of you or

349
00:19:57.271 --> 00:20:02.080
something.
I can't remember what it was.
But anyway,
a friend of mine runs this,
uh,

350
00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:05.460
company called Charles Tyrwhitt.
So I recall him,
Nick Wheeler,

351
00:20:05.461 --> 00:20:08.460
he's called and said,
can you send me some smarter clothes?

352
00:20:08.461 --> 00:20:11.280
And I swear that I've seen Jeremy Corbyn where this,

353
00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.520
I swear I noticed that he didn't declare it because I thought,

354
00:20:14.521 --> 00:20:16.830
how am I going to find out?
Cause the kind of guy that he is,

355
00:20:16.831 --> 00:20:19.800
I just dropped it off at his kind of,
uh,
you know,
way does it.

356
00:20:19.801 --> 00:20:23.340
Surgeries is an NP in his linkedin.
And I thought,
how am I going to know?

357
00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:27.390
And because whatever you think about Corbyn,
the guy's got integrity.

358
00:20:27.391 --> 00:20:30.780
I think he's got political integrity and integrity as a person.
And I thought,

359
00:20:30.781 --> 00:20:35.760
I'm sure he's going to declare like working for the BBC or lots of institutions.

360
00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:37.890
If someone gives you a presence above a certain value,

361
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.990
you've got to make a declaration about it,
right?

362
00:20:39.991 --> 00:20:43.560
So that you're not susceptible to bribery,
particularly as an NP.
Um,

363
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:46.830
but I haven't seen him make a declaration about these shirts.

364
00:20:46.831 --> 00:20:50.020
It well be that he just passed them on to his nearest charity shop.
Who knows?

365
00:20:50.021 --> 00:20:54.490
But I,
I'm pretty positive that I've seen him wear that.
Um,
so like I say,

366
00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:58.990
that's happened.
Something of that ilk.
Those are just a few quick examples.

367
00:20:58.991 --> 00:21:03.991
And there are literally hundreds of others that's happened every 24 hours for

368
00:21:04.481 --> 00:21:09.190
the last 1,136 days.
Uh,

369
00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:11.380
people are really into it,
you know,

370
00:21:11.381 --> 00:21:15.790
the Paul Graham guy and if you haven't read Paul Graham's essays,

371
00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:19.420
uh,
about,
well about everything basically.

372
00:21:19.421 --> 00:21:23.770
But the guy is super articulate and incredibly kind of perceptive.

373
00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:27.250
But one of the things that he said in his,
uh,

374
00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:31.540
he writes an essay about getting traction for whatever your new businesses

375
00:21:31.541 --> 00:21:34.840
initially and how it is you find your first customers.
And he said,

376
00:21:34.841 --> 00:21:36.460
and this really resonated with me,

377
00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:41.170
you're much better off creating something that are a hundred people absolutely

378
00:21:41.171 --> 00:21:44.410
love rather than a thousand people think is kind of okay.

379
00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:48.220
And that other than that I thought was going to be my kind of guiding light with

380
00:21:48.221 --> 00:21:50.230
this project.
That's what I'm going to do.

381
00:21:50.231 --> 00:21:54.640
Find something that people are super into rather than the kind of slightly

382
00:21:54.641 --> 00:21:57.430
ambivalent thing that occasionally I might dip in and out of.

383
00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:58.930
And because there's a frequent,

384
00:21:58.931 --> 00:22:02.350
what you'd call in TV world appointment to view slot cars every day at six

385
00:22:02.351 --> 00:22:07.270
o'clock,
something new is getting published,
there's a reason to keep coming back.

386
00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:10.840
Um,
so people's reactions have been amazing.

387
00:22:10.841 --> 00:22:14.050
I would defy you actually without sounding too kind of self congratulatory and

388
00:22:14.051 --> 00:22:18.080
annoying about it to find a website which has as positive,
uh,

389
00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:22.270
feedback as this one does,
uh,
is great for press,
you know,

390
00:22:22.271 --> 00:22:25.690
because you're always doing something or a invariably doing something which is

391
00:22:25.691 --> 00:22:30.310
either a positive or mischievous and tonally like it was saying the

392
00:22:30.311 --> 00:22:34.270
juxtaposition of things which is slightly kind of anti authority meets things

393
00:22:34.271 --> 00:22:37.660
which are just kind of kind and positive,
you know,

394
00:22:37.661 --> 00:22:42.580
existing in that space is good for social sharing.
Um,
and then,
yeah,

395
00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:45.970
and now as a lucky percentage of you have,

396
00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:51.240
I did a book deal about a year ago to write a book and basically what I've done

397
00:22:52.331 --> 00:22:57.331
there is to take 99 of the most popular or wishes that just appealed to me.

398
00:22:58.301 --> 00:23:02.650
So it's a selection of 99 of the thousand plus that the have been,

399
00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:07.680
and it attempts to articulate in a reasonably kind of a lighthearted fashion how

400
00:23:08.711 --> 00:23:12.790
it is that you can get a little bit closer to the aspirations that you might

401
00:23:12.791 --> 00:23:13.270
have it.

402
00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:16.180
So it's like a kind of self help book for people who would never read self help

403
00:23:16.181 --> 00:23:17.580
books.
And as you said,
it started,

404
00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:22.540
the conversation is designed to dip in and out of a classic book to have by the

405
00:23:22.541 --> 00:23:24.400
bath basically.
Um,

406
00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:26.980
and so other publishers around the world who have picked that up,

407
00:23:26.981 --> 00:23:30.670
I don't know that everyone's going to do these 99 covers.
That was,
uh,

408
00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:34.930
an idea that I had the,
I had never thought initially I thought,

409
00:23:34.931 --> 00:23:38.060
let's do five covers because I was quite into,
as you know,

410
00:23:38.061 --> 00:23:40.660
sometimes you'll see a magazine like vogue or published with five different

411
00:23:40.661 --> 00:23:43.390
covers or Gq for their man of the year awards,
you know,
and,

412
00:23:43.391 --> 00:23:46.580
and one will have tiny tempera and have Michael Caine or whatever.

413
00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:49.280
And I thought that I must work quite well our new standard.
Otherwise,

414
00:23:49.281 --> 00:23:51.920
they wouldn't do the incremental investment to do that.

415
00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:54.980
I wonder whether that could work for display the bookshop.

416
00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:58.400
And it does actually look nice in the,
uh,
when you see them all together.

417
00:23:58.401 --> 00:24:00.290
This is at the publishing house.
This is something,

418
00:24:00.291 --> 00:24:04.160
I took this photo the week before last,
when you see all 99 together,

419
00:24:04.161 --> 00:24:07.730
this a common visual gratification and I guess this initiative and the fact that

420
00:24:07.731 --> 00:24:10.010
these,
you know,
without again being too hot need about it,

421
00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:13.730
these wishes a super kind of diverse and no two are alike.

422
00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:17.420
That was the underlying point.
Uh,
and the designers did a brilliant job on that,

423
00:24:17.421 --> 00:24:18.530
you know,
um,

424
00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:22.130
the tone of it is designed as you'll see to be kind of lighthearted and

425
00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:24.260
accessible.
So I wish I could ever do it.
We can.

426
00:24:24.261 --> 00:24:25.790
I wish I knew a gentleman that they used to,

427
00:24:25.791 --> 00:24:29.220
I wish I could find the best slice of pie in the world,
et Cetera,

428
00:24:29.221 --> 00:24:31.640
which I have found the best lightweight in the world.
But that's another story.

429
00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:35.600
Uh,
so it's,
it's not the,
it's not,
I hope anyway,

430
00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:39.950
to kind of earn in that regard.
So those of you who've got a copy,

431
00:24:39.951 --> 00:24:42.770
I really hope you enjoy reading it to post a review on Amazon,

432
00:24:42.771 --> 00:24:46.540
if that is the case.
Um,
meanwhile,
so I'm thinking,
okay,

433
00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:50.470
so we're going to do with this thing.
I've managed to make it kind of,
um,

434
00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:53.450
not too expensive to run.
As I say,

435
00:24:53.451 --> 00:24:56.870
I'm a massive disciple of the lean startup ideology.

436
00:24:56.871 --> 00:25:00.200
So you will be surprised how little it has cost to do it.

437
00:25:00.201 --> 00:25:02.570
But you can see from those examples that I gave you,

438
00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:05.960
it doesn't cost that much to send a bunch of glitter to a far right leader,

439
00:25:05.961 --> 00:25:10.760
for example.
They don't need to be enormous grandiose gestures,
these things.

440
00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:12.260
But I was thinking,
okay,

441
00:25:12.261 --> 00:25:15.410
so how am I going to make this like a commercial proposition?
And in a way,

442
00:25:15.411 --> 00:25:20.300
is it kind of spoil the fact cause no one's ever been charged for anything.
Um,

443
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:25.870
is it going to kind of soya or somehow compromise it if it becomes something

444
00:25:26.361 --> 00:25:31.100
which has got this commercial overlay on top of it?
So my solution to that,

445
00:25:31.101 --> 00:25:33.320
such as it was,
I may well be proved completely wrong,

446
00:25:33.321 --> 00:25:36.710
but this is my endeavor and I'll try and be successful in achieving it,

447
00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:41.060
was to say,
okay,
so let's see if we can make it a kind of cross platform entity.

448
00:25:41.061 --> 00:25:44.360
I've got to ideas around life events was a website.
There's an APP,

449
00:25:44.361 --> 00:25:47.690
there's a book as I say,
which you have in front of you now.
And then I thought,

450
00:25:47.691 --> 00:25:50.090
okay,
so let's see what we could do with a TV show.
Yeah.

451
00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:54.530
Because wish fulfillment in TV terms,
it's been a huge kind of genre.

452
00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:59.000
And if you can get it right then it's fantastic because it's heartwarming.

453
00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:03.590
It appeals across a huge kind of demographic and particularly large commercial,

454
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:04.250
uh,

455
00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:09.250
stations like ITV or really into programs where the whole family is gathered in

456
00:26:10.041 --> 00:26:12.380
front of the screen rather than a singular demographic.

457
00:26:12.381 --> 00:26:16.340
They don't really sell a singular demographic in the way that a news website

458
00:26:16.341 --> 00:26:19.360
might.
They sell reach and they sell,
uh,
you know,

459
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:22.640
particular kind of profiles around adults with children,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

460
00:26:22.641 --> 00:26:24.140
So if you can get it right then it's cool.

461
00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:28.010
But I didn't want to do something which was so kind of vanilla or lowest common

462
00:26:28.011 --> 00:26:33.011
denominator that it felt like it wasn't a adhering to the spirit of the project

463
00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:37.700
today.
And so I got a little bit of cash from,

464
00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:41.180
uh,
and network in the states actually.

465
00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:45.010
And then I linked up with a guy called Ryan Ferguson,

466
00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:49.200
who I only knew by reputation,
who runs as a slightly shadowy,

467
00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:52.220
a collective of,
uh,

468
00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:57.360
it's like an archaic kind of art collective of graffiti artists and civil

469
00:26:57.361 --> 00:27:02.361
activists who exist as this kind of shadowy force who can be marshaled when

470
00:27:03.061 --> 00:27:04.680
given an instruction from their leader.

471
00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:06.720
I know that it makes it sound slightly kind of cult like,

472
00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:10.650
but they do very cool things.
So I thought he'd be good to work with.

473
00:27:10.651 --> 00:27:14.850
So he's based in,
uh,
Las Vegas.
So I flew out to la.

474
00:27:14.851 --> 00:27:16.260
He came down from Las Vegas.

475
00:27:16.261 --> 00:27:20.390
We had a little pot of cash that the network had given us.
And so,
uh,

476
00:27:20.391 --> 00:27:21.990
I'll show you now the film that we shot,

477
00:27:21.991 --> 00:27:23.640
which is like what they call a sizzle reel,

478
00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.790
which you then take out to broadcasters and see whether or not they think there

479
00:27:26.791 --> 00:27:31.200
might be potential in developing it further.
So you can see that,
like I say,

480
00:27:31.201 --> 00:27:36.201
a kind of combination of things which are a random acts of kindness meet the

481
00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.830
articulation I suppose.

482
00:27:40.831 --> 00:27:44.340
And obviously I've realized that Donald Trump is like a super kind of lazy

483
00:27:44.341 --> 00:27:46.050
target for anything satirical.

484
00:27:46.051 --> 00:27:48.750
And I realized also that he was democratically elected,

485
00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:53.580
but it is additionally the case that there's a overwhelming number of people who

486
00:27:53.581 --> 00:27:58.470
are,
are pleased to see him lampooned.
And so,
uh,

487
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:59.251
as I say,

488
00:27:59.251 --> 00:28:02.310
the site isn't miraculously claiming that they'll be able to remove him from

489
00:28:02.311 --> 00:28:02.640
power.

490
00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:06.780
You're just doing something to kind of visualize the wish that people have made.

491
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:11.880
Um,
so the ambition,
as I say,

492
00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.950
wait,
I've gone too far,
uh,

493
00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:17.820
is to have this brand that lives in every vertical or,

494
00:28:17.821 --> 00:28:22.050
or a significant number of verticals so that a web presence APP exists already.

495
00:28:22.051 --> 00:28:26.250
Ios App.
I haven't done an android app yet.
I'm sorry about that.
I should not,
uh,

496
00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:29.010
the book,
which exists the TV,

497
00:28:29.011 --> 00:28:32.080
which it depends who it is that one partner is with.
Like I say,

498
00:28:32.081 --> 00:28:35.610
if you do it for ITV Margaret,
to do something slightly different to that,

499
00:28:35.611 --> 00:28:38.310
which is going to be a little bit too edgy for them.

500
00:28:38.311 --> 00:28:43.080
So it depends who your partner is.
There are a number of people who are,

501
00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:47.190
uh,
you know,
if you were looking 10,
even five years ago,

502
00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:52.110
you and he had a TV idea in the states,
you could either go to a network,
NBC,
CBS,

503
00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:56.410
Fox,
et Cetera,
uh,
or you go to a cable operator to get your ideas away.

504
00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:58.830
Now those people are still buying stuff or they're,

505
00:28:58.831 --> 00:29:00.930
they're increasingly risk averse creatively,

506
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:03.600
but there's a new generation led by Netflix,
therefore,

507
00:29:03.601 --> 00:29:08.370
obviously on demand players who are interested in innovative content and Amazon

508
00:29:08.371 --> 00:29:12.330
have joined that fray now and putting significant budgets into originated,

509
00:29:12.331 --> 00:29:14.890
both scripted and unscripted.
Uh,

510
00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:18.820
and I think we'll see now a new wave,
uh,

511
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:23.880
of snapchat style people who are wanting to get into the content provision game.

512
00:29:23.881 --> 00:29:27.270
And I noticed with interest this week that,
uh,

513
00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:31.470
Facebook have developed a slingbox has style app that enables you to watch

514
00:29:31.471 --> 00:29:34.360
Facebook videos,
videos,
obviously amazing for them.

515
00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:37.770
They're putting strategically a whole lot of stuff around going live,
blah,
blah,

516
00:29:37.771 --> 00:29:40.920
blah,
blah,
blah.
An APP that enables you to watch that stuff on your TV.

517
00:29:40.921 --> 00:29:44.530
So this convergence that we've read about and heard about for so long of all the

518
00:29:44.531 --> 00:29:48.370
screens coming together into a single entity,
that time is upon us.

519
00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:53.920
The other aspect,
and I'm not like a crazy kind of data had kind of person,

520
00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:59.220
but it is interesting to me and obviously one needs to use and harness that data

521
00:29:59.831 --> 00:30:02.140
in a way which is respectful and appropriate.

522
00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:07.500
But the idea that people volunteer information about the things they most want

523
00:30:08.141 --> 00:30:11.410
in the world and then something meaningful happens as a result I think is a kind

524
00:30:11.411 --> 00:30:15.230
of powerful one.
Uh,
you know,
one of the reasons he said staging the blind,

525
00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:19.650
the obvious that Google is the extraordinary company that it is in terms of uh,

526
00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:24.520
its cultural impact and in terms of it's a moneymaking abilities is that if I

527
00:30:24.521 --> 00:30:26.170
put into Google as a search term,

528
00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:30.610
flowers in Brighton or flights to Paris or the therapist in London or whatever

529
00:30:30.611 --> 00:30:35.080
it may be,
that's a pretty strong indicator that I'm in demand for those things,

530
00:30:35.081 --> 00:30:39.010
those people competing to bid on those key search terms.
Uh,

531
00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:42.880
and so I wouldn't want to take this into a kind of territory whereby one was

532
00:30:42.881 --> 00:30:46.390
aggressively exploiting that.
Not suggesting that you guys do that by the way,

533
00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:47.920
but the,

534
00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:53.370
the idea that I haven't fully developed this thought so you'll have to bear with

535
00:30:53.681 --> 00:30:55.690
me as it is only partially formed,

536
00:30:55.691 --> 00:31:00.691
but the idea of fleshing out and making a bit more human and a bit more rounded

537
00:31:01.781 --> 00:31:04.060
and a bit more as we are as individuals.

538
00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:09.180
Those kind of requests whereby your Prozac transactional requirements are have a

539
00:31:10.031 --> 00:31:13.270
kind of counterbalance of things which are a bit more intrinsic in a bit more

540
00:31:13.271 --> 00:31:16.330
kind of inner directed.
That feels interesting to me potentially.

541
00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:21.760
And I think that we will see outside of search here,

542
00:31:21.761 --> 00:31:23.580
let's just assume that you guys have nailed search,

543
00:31:23.581 --> 00:31:25.360
which I think we can say that you kind of have,

544
00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:29.050
but outside of that in terms of brand building stuff and search isn't always the

545
00:31:29.051 --> 00:31:32.020
strongest way to build a brand and make a contribution to that.

546
00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:36.400
But I think the most resonant brands in the future are going to be looking for

547
00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:40.250
these cross platform solutions.
They're looking for meaningful data,

548
00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:44.170
not anonymous reach.
And that was one of the reasons why our commercially,

549
00:31:44.171 --> 00:31:45.040
for example,

550
00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:50.050
a organization like the Guardian and massively kind of a deferential towards the

551
00:31:50.051 --> 00:31:52.300
Guardian in terms of their editorial stance in the world.

552
00:31:52.301 --> 00:31:56.050
But one of the issues that they have commercially is I think they went through a

553
00:31:56.051 --> 00:31:59.920
period of thinking that reach and scale was going to be enough.
Oh,

554
00:31:59.921 --> 00:32:03.040
we're in Australia now,
we're in the states now we've got this bureau,
blah,
blah,

555
00:32:03.041 --> 00:32:03.700
blah,
blah,
blah.

556
00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:06.220
Actually advertisers need something and want something slightly more

557
00:32:06.221 --> 00:32:07.360
sophisticated than that.

558
00:32:07.361 --> 00:32:11.350
And anonymous reaches increasingly quite a tricky thing to monetize.
You know,

559
00:32:11.351 --> 00:32:13.990
they want meaningful insight.
Uh,

560
00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:17.140
again stating the blandly obvious but engaging content,

561
00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:20.560
not broadcast messages,
rich experiences,

562
00:32:20.561 --> 00:32:22.360
not just conventional kinds of media.

563
00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:27.690
And also I think particularly for the kind of generation x a a,

564
00:32:28.091 --> 00:32:30.520
I don't mean this in like a some kind of quasi religious sense,

565
00:32:30.521 --> 00:32:34.960
but being possessed of a higher purpose,
not a purely transactional thing.

566
00:32:34.961 --> 00:32:39.350
What is it beyond enriching your small group of shareholders that your honor to

567
00:32:39.351 --> 00:32:42.500
do?
What contribution is your brand making to the world?

568
00:32:42.501 --> 00:32:45.950
I think that's super important kind of thing.
And finally,
you know,

569
00:32:45.951 --> 00:32:50.420
we're all super adept to zoning out advertising messages.

570
00:32:50.421 --> 00:32:52.730
If they do reach us,
we'd likely to be cynical about them.

571
00:32:52.731 --> 00:32:56.450
But we've been trying as hard as we can to avoid them.
We have ad blockers,

572
00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:58.640
popup blockers,
we have spam filters,

573
00:32:58.641 --> 00:33:01.610
we have signs on our letterbox saying no junk mail.

574
00:33:01.611 --> 00:33:06.611
We have PVRs that enable us to fast forward through the ads times 30 and so I

575
00:33:07.281 --> 00:33:10.250
think increasingly I'm not one of those people says,
oh,
that game's over,

576
00:33:10.251 --> 00:33:11.690
blah blah blah.
I don't think it is over a tool.

577
00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:16.430
But what is the case is that it is irrefutable that if you are associated with

578
00:33:16.431 --> 00:33:19.210
an action as a brand,
that is something which has taken place in,

579
00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:20.270
happened in the real world.

580
00:33:20.271 --> 00:33:25.250
And so if I was creating a kind of mini model in terms of how it is that brands

581
00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:28.370
should engage with their consumers in the future,

582
00:33:28.371 --> 00:33:32.210
I would say that do something meaningful to do something special that resonates

583
00:33:32.211 --> 00:33:36.530
with people and their news media to shine a light on what it is that you've done

584
00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:38.690
and encourage people to kind of share it.

585
00:33:38.691 --> 00:33:43.100
And I think that if one gets that right,
that can be quite kind of powerful.
Um,

586
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:44.091
so like I said,

587
00:33:44.091 --> 00:33:46.780
I don't know whether they still today people still talk about moon shots sooner.

588
00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:51.170
You see that phrase moonshots in terms of,
uh,
something which feels like a,

589
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:56.590
a large idea that you probably won't necessarily be successful in achieving,

590
00:33:57.351 --> 00:34:01.100
but nevertheless you don't let that prevent you from sending out on the
endeavor.

591
00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:04.160
And I think here,
and this,
as I say,
I've done this completely on my own.

592
00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:08.270
Occasionally.
My girlfriend helps me out intimately.
I have,
uh,
an intern,

593
00:34:08.271 --> 00:34:12.140
but I kind of find that managing the interns basically easier just to kind of do

594
00:34:12.141 --> 00:34:16.700
it myself.
So this is how far I've got on my own with no money,
no VC capital,

595
00:34:16.701 --> 00:34:20.150
anything of that kind.
And fundamentally when you boil it down,

596
00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:25.700
this is a place where anyone can share the things they most want in the world.

597
00:34:25.701 --> 00:34:30.701
They can articulate those things and a meaningful outcome because as a result,

598
00:34:32.151 --> 00:34:34.270
and that to me feels like,
you know,

599
00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:37.820
a pretty big thought that I've only gone like I tiny,

600
00:34:37.821 --> 00:34:41.540
tiny distance of scratching 1% of the,
of the surface or,

601
00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:44.780
but that's my kind of like guiding star in terms of,
uh,

602
00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:48.640
the core principle from which I will not kind of deviate.
And as I say it,

603
00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:53.630
we're one to amplify that as an idea,
I think that conceivably is a huge,

604
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:57.680
uh,
a genuinely a huge thing.
Um,
so,
you know,

605
00:34:57.681 --> 00:35:00.680
it's really not like a big deal this thing.
Uh,

606
00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:03.320
and because I haven't quite worked out and monetize [inaudible] model,

607
00:35:03.321 --> 00:35:06.410
I was in this slightly weird situation where you know,

608
00:35:06.411 --> 00:35:10.070
normally everyone's super obsessed with getting users and we've got these growth

609
00:35:10.071 --> 00:35:13.800
hacking techniques and there's entire industries that have grown up around how

610
00:35:13.801 --> 00:35:16.550
it is that you acquire and hold onto users,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

611
00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:19.670
This isn't like that because I didn't really know I was doing,

612
00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:22.580
I just wanted to do something cool everyday and I know that sounds a bit

613
00:35:22.581 --> 00:35:27.200
ridiculous,
but that is genuinely the activity that I've been engaged with.

614
00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:30.980
But there are,
there were a load of wishes on the site now.

615
00:35:30.981 --> 00:35:33.890
There are too many actually.
And one of the things that I,

616
00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:39.630
one of the aspects of the experience doesn't work and I could do an entire

617
00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:44.430
longer presentation about all the floors and this idea I hasten to add is that

618
00:35:44.431 --> 00:35:49.200
if you put a wish on the site at the moment,
light layers of sedimentary rock,

619
00:35:49.201 --> 00:35:52.860
you know,
you've got to kind of get through loads before it gets to the top.

620
00:35:52.861 --> 00:35:55.800
It's not quite as tricky as one necessarily my thing,
but

621
00:35:57.390 --> 00:36:00.480
that can be a bit demotivating.
I back to my original problem,

622
00:36:00.481 --> 00:36:02.880
what I put that thing on there and then nothing happens.
No one agrees with me.

623
00:36:02.881 --> 00:36:04.890
No one likes my wish that cause that's the kind of thing that can be

624
00:36:04.891 --> 00:36:06.810
disproportionately depressing.

625
00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:11.310
And so sometimes I wonder in this a family role disappearing photos age in which

626
00:36:11.311 --> 00:36:11.940
we live,

627
00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:15.480
maybe I should just reset the board every day at six o'clock and all the wishes

628
00:36:15.481 --> 00:36:17.460
should vanish and then people remake them.

629
00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:21.300
But maybe that itself would be like a laborious and demotivating experience to

630
00:36:21.301 --> 00:36:23.400
have to that once again put it on that.

631
00:36:23.401 --> 00:36:25.050
So there are loads of things still to kind of crack.

632
00:36:25.051 --> 00:36:27.630
But currently if hypothetically speaking,

633
00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:31.470
I stopped taking wishes today and just thought,
right,

634
00:36:31.471 --> 00:36:34.500
I'll action or the wishes that you know are on the site currently,

635
00:36:34.501 --> 00:36:37.170
it would take me over 30 years to get through all the ones that are currently

636
00:36:37.171 --> 00:36:40.890
there,
which I'm got times there anyway,
I'm out of the 45 minute mark,

637
00:36:40.891 --> 00:36:42.990
so I've slightly gone over.
Thank you very much for listening.

638
00:36:42.991 --> 00:36:45.150
I really appreciate your time.
It's a great privilege to be here.

639
00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:46.950
We've got a little bit of time for questions.

640
00:36:46.951 --> 00:36:49.200
If anyone's got anything thing that they would like to ask me.

641
00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:55.170
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

642
00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:02.830
<v 0>hi.
Sorry Kevin.
A little bit late.
Have no idea what I'm talking about.
Oh,</v>

643
00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:06.320
what am I doing?
Uh,
no,
just,
you may have explained this at the beginning.

644
00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:07.760
I was just wondering how you,
uh,

645
00:37:07.850 --> 00:37:12.440
how are you funded or is it sort of self funded or [inaudible] it's a kind of

646
00:37:12.441 --> 00:37:17.180
combination of things.
It's the kind of size now where does it say,

647
00:37:17.181 --> 00:37:17.631
and this is a,

648
00:37:17.631 --> 00:37:20.990
this is a true example that's an easy one to give you say the wishes.

649
00:37:20.991 --> 00:37:25.010
Quite a lot of the wishing seem to relate to a low level of anxiety where people

650
00:37:25.011 --> 00:37:27.980
are articulating the fact that their lives haven't quite turned out and the way

651
00:37:27.981 --> 00:37:30.470
that they hope they might basically.
So say the wish was,

652
00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:33.470
I wish I didn't feel sad,
anxious,
uh,

653
00:37:33.471 --> 00:37:38.270
which I've had a bunch of times I could then as I've done reach out to,

654
00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:41.420
um,
there's a little bronco rescue remedy.
Do you know that brand too?
Is it is,

655
00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:44.270
it comes in a little per and you put a couple minutes,
it might be psychosomatic.

656
00:37:44.271 --> 00:37:47.750
I've got no idea.
But it claims to what chills you out and uh,

657
00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:50.340
stills an overactive mind.
Um,

658
00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:55.730
so I can say to them and hearing I think lies something potentially,
again,

659
00:37:55.731 --> 00:37:59.600
quite big because what advertising does historically is advertising vomits all

660
00:37:59.601 --> 00:38:03.110
this stuff into the world and hopes that it mops up a few people who are in

661
00:38:03.111 --> 00:38:05.390
market for what it is that it's got to offer.

662
00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:09.680
Whereas what it is that I'm offering is a whole load of people who have self

663
00:38:09.681 --> 00:38:14.000
electively raised their own hands to say,
I am feeling anxious.

664
00:38:14.001 --> 00:38:17.720
So that's really valuable data.
So I can in my,
as I say,
low level way,

665
00:38:17.721 --> 00:38:21.180
it is just me and my bedroom kind of thing.
I can say to people,
um,

666
00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:23.690
I can say that due to,
you know,
rescue remedy,

667
00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:26.510
I've got a lot of people here who have already told me that they feel anxious

668
00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:28.250
and you came to make this great product.

669
00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:30.980
Why don't you send a sample of your product to each of these people?

670
00:38:30.981 --> 00:38:32.030
And if it's as good as you claim it,

671
00:38:32.031 --> 00:38:34.730
as I'm sure you'll have some customers for life or if it kills their anxiety,

672
00:38:34.731 --> 00:38:38.320
you probably wouldn't,
which you,
but you get the point.
Uh,
the,
the,
the,

673
00:38:38.321 --> 00:38:39.420
the kind of the,

674
00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:44.480
the fact is that it's really valuable to be able to have a conversation with a

675
00:38:45.101 --> 00:38:46.960
brand and say,

676
00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:51.220
I've got people who are in market for what it is that you do.

677
00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:54.100
And so I've been able to do that,

678
00:38:54.101 --> 00:38:57.250
which enables therefore the end user to get a good result.

679
00:38:57.251 --> 00:38:59.830
I put this wish on a random website and now someone's actually sent me a

680
00:38:59.831 --> 00:39:03.140
physical thing in the mail.
That's cool.
So that's a great result for that.

681
00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:06.910
And it hasn't cost me anything to do it.
So that's one way in which I do.

682
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:08.770
Sometimes I spend my own money on it,

683
00:39:08.771 --> 00:39:12.680
but I try not to for obvious kind of reasons.
Um,

684
00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:16.360
and sometimes,
and I'm reasonably good at doing this,
I'll,

685
00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:20.830
I'll create a solution which I think is potentially potent,

686
00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:24.640
but doesn't necessarily have a huge budget attached to it.
So the examples that,

687
00:39:24.641 --> 00:39:28.570
okay,
I'm not sure what point you came into the presentation,
my friend,

688
00:39:28.571 --> 00:39:32.950
but the examples that I gave were all pretty low cost things that people seem to

689
00:39:32.951 --> 00:39:37.510
enjoy.
So it doesn't need to cost the earth.
My worry,
and I easily could have,

690
00:39:37.511 --> 00:39:38.940
I think,
uh,

691
00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:44.200
this is slightly lessons now because we're in an economically more uncertain

692
00:39:44.201 --> 00:39:46.150
time because of Brexit,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

693
00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:50.650
But there was a time a couple of years ago where it was quite easy to get,

694
00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:55.480
you know,
let's say 200 grand or something,
a seed money from,
uh,

695
00:39:55.570 --> 00:39:58.270
you know,
I'll,
I'll,
I want to be tech investor.

696
00:39:58.510 --> 00:40:02.830
The issue then becomes their business plan becomes your business plan.

697
00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:04.520
And I didn't want the,

698
00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:08.080
the management of minority investment investors a pain in the ass at the best of

699
00:40:08.081 --> 00:40:11.710
times,
but I wasn't quite sure how to make money out of it.

700
00:40:11.711 --> 00:40:14.800
And whether or not the way in which I thought I might ultimately make money was

701
00:40:14.801 --> 00:40:16.810
going to be something that they enjoy it.
So I just thought,

702
00:40:16.811 --> 00:40:19.600
I'm just going to retain 100% of the equity and just do it myself.

703
00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:21.760
I don't know whether that was the right decision or not,

704
00:40:21.761 --> 00:40:22.594
but that's what I've done.

705
00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:27.673
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

706
00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:31.910
<v 2>Yeah.
Um,
so in this sort of world of fake news,</v>

707
00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:34.400
have you thought about,
um,

708
00:40:34.610 --> 00:40:38.210
sort of guarding against becoming a propaganda machine?
I'm thinking about the,

709
00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:41.150
the,
the Donald Trump thing is that it may,

710
00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:44.150
if now that he knows that that happened where she probably didn't like very
much.

711
00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:48.740
Yeah,
we lost too much.
We thick skin and,

712
00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:50.150
but now that that's come out,

713
00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:53.750
maybe now people will start to look at your platform and take it much more

714
00:40:53.751 --> 00:40:57.270
seriously and then sort of tried to battle against it.
So how,

715
00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:58.880
how have you thought about how you might,
well,

716
00:40:58.930 --> 00:41:00.100
<v 0>I,
I,</v>

717
00:41:01.330 --> 00:41:04.810
I mean my response is maybe a tiny bit in terms of what I've done so far might

718
00:41:04.811 --> 00:41:09.550
be inadequate.
I'd be happy to concede that it has been.
What I've done is to,

719
00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:13.330
uh,
when I write up what I generally do is like post the photo with the thing and

720
00:41:13.331 --> 00:41:16.480
then do a couple of hundred words of copy a,
sometimes a bit less.

721
00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:20.560
And I'm at pains to point out though we don't have a kind of political dog in

722
00:41:20.561 --> 00:41:24.010
the fight,
et Cetera,
et cetera.
Just to stress the neutrality of the platform.

723
00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:29.170
And what I've also found,
so in,
in,
uh,
the case of UK politics,

724
00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:30.273
um,

725
00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:35.690
I have done so did that Corbyn was slightly sarcastic attack on the leader of

726
00:41:36.111 --> 00:41:38.600
the opposition.
I suppose attack is too strong a word,
but you know what I mean,

727
00:41:38.601 --> 00:41:40.190
a bit of a death.
Uh,

728
00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:44.610
I did a Ed Miliband thing where people wish that their,
uh,

729
00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:48.770
MP spent more time in the constituency that that ostensibly meant to represent.

730
00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:50.380
So I an Admin,
a band,
a,

731
00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:55.490
a map of his constituency in North York show where he apparently was very

732
00:41:55.491 --> 00:42:00.320
infrequently seen a,
I've done a bunch of David Cameron things.
I did a thing,

733
00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:03.440
uh,
once,
uh,

734
00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:05.660
with another politician whereby it was a,

735
00:42:05.661 --> 00:42:08.480
it was a kind of trade thing basically where he wasn't doing enough for free

736
00:42:08.481 --> 00:42:12.620
trade,
so I send,
let it bananas,
et Cetera,
et cetera.
So if I was to evaluate it,

737
00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:17.750
everyone has been kind of no,
as I say that anyone's losing any sleep over it.

738
00:42:17.751 --> 00:42:22.100
But everyone's been tarred with the same brush in that to the new standards,

739
00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:26.900
<v 2>I'm sorry.
And if they're starting to see that that's something will happen.</v>

740
00:42:26.901 --> 00:42:31.901
If a wish with them attached to it starts becoming a thing that they might start

741
00:42:32.361 --> 00:42:34.030
going right this way.
Chabad,
you know,

742
00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:37.430
Donald Trump being shown for who he is actually needs to be stopped and then

743
00:42:37.431 --> 00:42:39.670
they tried to stop it from becoming the wish of the day

744
00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:42.560
<v 0>and then another sort of,
yeah,
I guess you'd have to,
it's a big number.</v>

745
00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:46.030
The stars that I've taken so far,
and as I say,
it's the same.

746
00:42:46.070 --> 00:42:48.750
If sufficient number of people feel that this is something they want to see

747
00:42:48.751 --> 00:42:52.970
happen.
I'm not a political person,
but I will make your wish naked Trump statute,

748
00:42:52.971 --> 00:42:56.850
whatever.
I will make it kind of manifest,
but in so whilst doing that,

749
00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.120
I'm going to stress that personally I don't have an opinion about Donald Trump.

750
00:43:00.121 --> 00:43:02.370
We're just a service that brings things to life that otherwise,

751
00:43:02.371 --> 00:43:04.650
as I say would remain tweets or whatever.

752
00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:09.930
<v 2>If we have time for maybe one or two more questions.
There's one here.</v>

753
00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:16.750
<v 3>Hi.
What's your trickiest wish been to manifest if you had one that's ever really</v>

754
00:43:16.751 --> 00:43:17.584
stumped you?

755
00:43:17.830 --> 00:43:20.410
<v 0>Well,
a little bit because I suppose the,</v>

756
00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:23.570
I have a bit of a get out because I'm not,
like I said at the site,

757
00:43:23.571 --> 00:43:25.970
I'm not guaranteeing to kind of make this soft come true.

758
00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:28.540
I'm just a tiny gesture.

759
00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:33.190
So generally I only sent out to do something that I know I can achieve by six

760
00:43:33.191 --> 00:43:37.750
o'clock.
And I learned the hard way,
uh,
early on where I would find myself,

761
00:43:38.050 --> 00:43:38.381
you know,

762
00:43:38.381 --> 00:43:42.010
thinking about what the train times we're down to Kent so I could do some prank

763
00:43:42.011 --> 00:43:44.110
on Nigel Farrage or something.
And then I think she,

764
00:43:44.111 --> 00:43:45.100
I just haven't got time to do this.

765
00:43:45.101 --> 00:43:48.070
I'm going to have to give them a downloadable poster or something instead.

766
00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:50.470
So generally I don't,
um,

767
00:43:51.070 --> 00:43:55.810
I don't come on stop that often.
I haven't missed one yet.

768
00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:59.500
But definitely some of them are uh,
more testing than others.

769
00:43:59.501 --> 00:44:03.190
And I'll think to myself,
okay,
what am I actually going to do here?

770
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:06.850
And typically those are the more conventional wishes where someone will say,

771
00:44:06.851 --> 00:44:10.810
I wish my son is really ill and he just wants to go to Disneyland and could

772
00:44:10.811 --> 00:44:14.170
because one thinks about wishes in that kind of sentence.
I think.

773
00:44:14.171 --> 00:44:15.940
Cause you've seen that on TV programs,

774
00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:19.450
what you've read about it on the press or you saw something go fund me that went

775
00:44:19.451 --> 00:44:21.790
really well or whatever.
So quite often those ones,

776
00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:26.020
those are the times when I feel like I'm disappointing people or bed cause I

777
00:44:26.021 --> 00:44:28.450
will help them with that.
I'll publicize their campaign,

778
00:44:28.451 --> 00:44:31.890
I'll tell the story and I'll amplify it to the people who follow me on social

779
00:44:31.891 --> 00:44:34.290
media or whatever,
all of which is kind of positive.

780
00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:36.990
But as a part of me that's thinking when they put that wish on the side,

781
00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:39.570
they thought they were going to get him tickets to Disneyland the next day.

782
00:44:39.571 --> 00:44:42.120
So that's the kind of time where I think,
oh shit,
you know,

783
00:44:42.121 --> 00:44:44.880
that's something that that may be going to find that a little bit underwhelming.

784
00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:48.960
But although having said that,
no one's ever got in touch with me and said,

785
00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:50.880
oh my God,
that was so lame when you did that thing.

786
00:44:50.881 --> 00:44:52.800
I hate you and might have thought it.

787
00:44:58.510 --> 00:44:59.343
<v 1>Okay.</v>

788
00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:04.820
<v 4>I'm interested to know your thought process around how you keep control of the</v>

789
00:45:05.401 --> 00:45:09.510
actions and whether or not you've considered sort of outsourcing to the,

790
00:45:09.511 --> 00:45:13.140
the people on the site.
It was when you said about there the old people home,

791
00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:16.620
like if you could just with the users you could a scout that so everyone did.

792
00:45:16.621 --> 00:45:19.950
But then where as we went through the three,
the presentation,
I was like,
Ooh,
no,

793
00:45:19.951 --> 00:45:21.900
you probably want to keep control.
Yeah,

794
00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:26.660
<v 0>you still are.
I've got someone I know a little bit,
I don't know very well,</v>

795
00:45:26.661 --> 00:45:28.280
but we've had coffee a couple of times,

796
00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:32.930
has got a site which were lies on peer to peer wish fulfillment.

797
00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:35.550
So I go on there and I say,
ah,

798
00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:38.620
I live in Shepherd's Bush and I'm having problems with my boiler.

799
00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:42.380
Both of those facts are actually true cause that,
and then someone else says,

800
00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:45.320
I will totally help you with your boiler.
And I said all that.
It's great.

801
00:45:45.321 --> 00:45:48.650
We've made this fantastic craigslist style connection.

802
00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:52.930
But simultaneously I'm mindful of the several serial killers who have stalked a

803
00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:53.853
Craig's list.

804
00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:57.230
And so I'm thinking there's a vulnerable woman who lives on her own.

805
00:45:57.231 --> 00:45:58.340
She doesn't know what to do with that boy,

806
00:45:58.341 --> 00:46:02.540
that she hasn't got the cash that it necessitates to get Pimlico plumbers out,

807
00:46:02.541 --> 00:46:04.580
which is in my experience,
many hundreds of pounds.

808
00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:08.000
And so this guy is going to,

809
00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:13.010
who I have effectively brokered an introduction to is going to manifest on her

810
00:46:13.011 --> 00:46:16.130
doorstep.
I don't know that fucking guy is.
He could be absolutely anyone.

811
00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:19.200
And so that's one of the reasons I'm,
that kind of stuff.
Uh,

812
00:46:19.201 --> 00:46:23.180
aside from how hideous some kind of incident would be of that nature obviously,

813
00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:27.380
but not sure it can killer platform in seconds right there.
You know,
I'm,

814
00:46:27.590 --> 00:46:32.300
I'm amazed that airbnb have come back so many times from people trashing

815
00:46:32.301 --> 00:46:36.470
apartments in New York and having amphetamine fueled gay orgies and all this

816
00:46:36.471 --> 00:46:38.990
kind of crazy stuff that's happened.
There are many,

817
00:46:38.991 --> 00:46:41.690
many occasions and in fairness to Brian Chesky and card,

818
00:46:41.691 --> 00:46:43.160
they've always managed that in quite a bit.
Well,

819
00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:47.810
but I didn't want to be dealing with that and so I thought that if I'm in charge

820
00:46:47.811 --> 00:46:48.620
of it,

821
00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:53.620
that works better and it be risks it and editorially I can sign off my own kind

822
00:46:54.711 --> 00:46:59.330
of idea,
which implementational terms just makes it way simpler.

823
00:46:59.330 --> 00:47:02.720
It's like working for an ad agency and pitching an idea to the client and then

824
00:47:02.721 --> 00:47:06.080
going to sit in the client's Jen and say,
yeah,
I buy your idea.
It makes it much,

825
00:47:06.081 --> 00:47:09.380
much easier cause I got to do something every day.
Um,

826
00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:15.020
there are however occasions where if it's publicising someone's fundraising idea

827
00:47:15.021 --> 00:47:18.070
or a little boy wants to let a birthday cards or whatever,
I just said,
look,

828
00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:19.190
send me all the birthday cards.

829
00:47:19.191 --> 00:47:21.780
I'll package them up into a single pass or which makes more sense,

830
00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:25.040
easier domestic cost of a stamp,
Robin International.

831
00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:27.350
And I'll send them all and that works really,
really well.

832
00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:30.610
Or people will get in touch with directly.
And again it says on the side,

833
00:47:30.611 --> 00:47:31.660
if you think you can help out,

834
00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:35.440
then email me and then I can slightly vet that person.
So they'll say,
well,

835
00:47:35.441 --> 00:47:37.120
I'm brilliant.
Uh,
uh,
you know,

836
00:47:37.121 --> 00:47:41.620
I'm great at public speaking or helping people overcome confidence issues and

837
00:47:41.621 --> 00:47:43.900
here's my credentials for that.
And then I can say,
okay,

838
00:47:43.901 --> 00:47:45.460
let's meet and have a cup of coffee.

839
00:47:45.461 --> 00:47:48.640
And I've met loads and loads of people because very frequently the wishes

840
00:47:48.641 --> 00:47:52.320
relates to a career dilemmas and so on.
So it's just a little,
come in,

841
00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:53.890
we'll have a conversation and we'll be,

842
00:47:54.310 --> 00:47:56.140
and that's invaluable kind of feedback to get cause,

843
00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:58.060
oh well how'd you find out about the site?
Blah,
blah,
blah.

844
00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:03.280
But 98% of the time I retain that control myself just because,
as I say,

845
00:48:03.281 --> 00:48:07.870
it would terrify me to broker,
to strangers,
uh,
introduced them to each other.

846
00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:12.280
That could be weird.
Is that it?
Is it time up?

847
00:48:12.281 --> 00:48:14.260
It's half past one.
You need to get back guys.

848
00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:20.290
Thank you very much for listening.
