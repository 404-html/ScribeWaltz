1
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.140
Joining us today.
We have Pejman knows ad and Mar Hershenson,

2
00:00:10.141 --> 00:00:13.350
two of the most respected venture capitalists in Silicon Valley.

3
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.890
In 2013 they teamed up to create page one mark and together invested in over 30

4
00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:21.390
startups including door dash,

5
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.480
garden health branch and Gusto.

6
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.200
Just last year they announced their second round of funding of $75 million and

7
00:00:30.421 --> 00:00:35.421
rebranded to pair on the who we are section of pairs website are the following

8
00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:40.380
words.
We understand what it means to build something from nothing.

9
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.260
That journey defines each of our life stories.

10
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.330
We are immigrants having come to America penniless,
but with big ideas.

11
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.140
We've been entrepreneurs determined to build great companies.

12
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.180
We know now that success emerges only for those who have endured setbacks and

13
00:00:57.181 --> 00:00:58.320
overcome hurdles.

14
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.220
We've learned from our failures and we know what it takes to succeed.

15
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.270
There are no shortcuts when it comes to building something extraordinary.

16
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.090
All of this finds expression in our work.

17
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.070
That quote speaks to what I think makes pair stand out among venture capital

18
00:01:14.071 --> 00:01:16.890
firms and it reflects the unique personal background.

19
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.470
That page mon in Mar experience.

20
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.340
I'm very excited that both of you are here with us today.

21
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.390
And maybe we can get started by having you share a little bit about your

22
00:01:27.391 --> 00:01:30.930
background,
where you grew up,
your career pathways,

23
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.760
and how you got into venture capital and we can see how your experiences

24
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.450
reflected in pairs mission statement.
Awesome.

25
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.490
That's my seniors just started ladies first.
Yeah.

26
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.130
<v 1>Okay.
Um,
I think [inaudible] has a great story,
but I'll go with my first.</v>

27
00:01:46.131 --> 00:01:50.990
I'm originally from Barcelona,
Spain and I apologize for my cold.
Um,

28
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.220
I came to the u s in [inaudible] 95,
uh,

29
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.480
do do a masters at Stanford and I ended up getting a phd in electrical

30
00:01:59.481 --> 00:02:04.340
engineering.
This was 1999 and I was ready to go to academia.

31
00:02:04.341 --> 00:02:09.341
I had already lined up a job professor job and at the last minute and the crazy

32
00:02:10.281 --> 00:02:14.590
time of 1999,
I decided to,
uh,
you know,

33
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.730
reject that offer and go do a startup.
And that was my first startup.
Um,

34
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.100
my phd was in circuit design in con,
you know,

35
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.970
analog chip designers was fairly technical and I also,
um,

36
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.080
did comebacks optimization,
large scale optimization.

37
00:02:30.081 --> 00:02:33.940
So I had kind of a dual background for somebody in chips.
Um,

38
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.290
my first company actually didn't work out,

39
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.300
but it was great learning ground for everything that came afterwards.

40
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.310
And after that I did two companies that did work out.
Uh,

41
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.030
so that was great.
Throughout my journey I met Pejman patch.

42
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.571
Mine was,

43
00:02:50.571 --> 00:02:55.571
I'm an investor in my second company and I remember going to pitch to Pesh Mine

44
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.200
and saying after my,
my first company had failed.
And you know,

45
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.400
I'm wondering who would give me money and patch mine.
I said,

46
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.550
depending on what I'm working on,
this is,
I've learned all of uh,

47
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:10.720
what customers want.

48
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.730
I'm building this software platform using convex optimization for designing

49
00:03:15.731 --> 00:03:19.420
chips and passionate and said,
I have no idea what you're talking about,

50
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.070
but I really like you.

51
00:03:21.071 --> 00:03:25.840
So I want to give you money and I will have my friends talk to you.

52
00:03:25.841 --> 00:03:27.910
And if they like you,
I'll just put around together.

53
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.360
And this was in 2004 and in 2000 a lot has changed since 2004.

54
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.290
In 2004 there was,
um,
I think maybe tech crunch had started,

55
00:03:38.291 --> 00:03:42.370
but there was no angel lists.
There was no sense of like,
uh,

56
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.530
Angel Investing as a sport.

57
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.570
It was really like a few people and you would have to raise by going to their

58
00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:54.190
big houses.
Nobody was in a coffee shop coding or you know,
it was very,

59
00:03:54.191 --> 00:03:58.990
very different.
So,
but Pejman was,
they're doing this from a very,

60
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.970
you know,
or at least stay every early point in this,
you know,
in,

61
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.690
in this seed movement that we have right now.
So anyways,

62
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.700
that's how I got to know patch mine.
And he approached me,

63
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.470
he approached me in 2010 with this idea of doing a house where we could work

64
00:04:14.471 --> 00:04:16.720
with founders and help them build companies.

65
00:04:16.721 --> 00:04:21.721
And it took about almost four years for me to like pull the plug and say,

66
00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:25.520
great,
let's go do this.
But that's how we got,
I got started into venture.

67
00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.250
<v 2>Oh well thank you for very much.
It's funny,</v>

68
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.730
I I I look at myself,
I don't have a tech background.

69
00:04:32.731 --> 00:04:34.860
I would have been investment background.
I'm a venture capitalist,

70
00:04:34.861 --> 00:04:38.300
so that tells you a little bit more about my background.
So I,
um,

71
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.380
came 24 years ago from Iran here,

72
00:04:40.381 --> 00:04:44.340
I didn't speak any English and I didn't want to come to America.

73
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.370
My brother just pushed me to come here and I ended up going to San Carlos

74
00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:51.990
because my uncle lived there.
I had $700.

75
00:04:51.991 --> 00:04:55.570
I lost all the money because I was calling the girl in Iran that I really love

76
00:04:55.571 --> 00:04:58.470
that I thought if I don't call her,
I lose her.
So,

77
00:04:58.471 --> 00:05:03.200
and at that time was like $4 per minute.
So because of the payphones,

78
00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.710
so I had,
there was no Google for none of these things today.
So,
um,
I ended up,

79
00:05:07.711 --> 00:05:11.370
my first job was washing cars in America and then ended up getting a job at the

80
00:05:11.371 --> 00:05:13.230
yogurt shop in Redwood City and,

81
00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.070
and I slipped in an ethic above the yogurt shop because I want to save money,

82
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.390
go marry the girl that I love.
So,
um,

83
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.290
and one of these nights I was studying English.

84
00:05:22.291 --> 00:05:26.220
I sign add that medallion rug gallery in downtown Palo Alto is hiring

85
00:05:26.221 --> 00:05:26.941
salespeople.

86
00:05:26.941 --> 00:05:31.650
So I ended up being a salesperson at that rug gallery and I became very good at

87
00:05:31.651 --> 00:05:34.590
selling carpets and Persian carpets are very,
very expensive.

88
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.690
So you don't sell him at the gallery,
you go take him to people's home.

89
00:05:38.691 --> 00:05:42.720
So after a few years in,
in one year,
I sold $8 million worth of carpet,

90
00:05:42.721 --> 00:05:44.100
which is like really unheard of.

91
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:48.030
But that tells the scope of the sales and the relationship we have with our

92
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.580
customers.
But you know,

93
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:54.360
in late nine is I figured out all of my customers are CEOs,
venture capitalist,

94
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.460
you know,
families of big companies.

95
00:05:56.461 --> 00:05:59.870
And I was amazed by the amount of value they're creating,

96
00:05:59.871 --> 00:06:03.560
not only nice homes and nice cars and the ability to buy cars was just really

97
00:06:03.561 --> 00:06:05.890
building companies based on knowledge.
And you know,
I,

98
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.440
I thought that I'd want to be one of fit and that I thought maybe this is the

99
00:06:09.441 --> 00:06:10.490
opportunity for me.

100
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.450
I'm having a job and the most important streak maybe in the most important time

101
00:06:14.451 --> 00:06:17.960
of my life.
And I started to educate,
educate myself,

102
00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:20.840
and I learned about the ecosystem and thinking about this as nineties,

103
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.220
late nineties,
it was no tech crunch,
no YC,
no blogging.
So the way I did it,

104
00:06:25.221 --> 00:06:29.720
I started to put lot of events and networking events at our place and the deal

105
00:06:29.721 --> 00:06:31.790
flow start to kick in.
And we started to invest.

106
00:06:31.791 --> 00:06:34.910
I convinced the owner of the rug gallery to start to invest with me.

107
00:06:34.911 --> 00:06:39.080
I didn't have money,
so he started it and we've made horrible mistakes,

108
00:06:39.081 --> 00:06:39.950
but I became very,

109
00:06:39.951 --> 00:06:44.000
very lucky nine months into it to meet Maurice Husband and Andy Rubin.

110
00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:45.651
This was dangerous.

111
00:06:45.651 --> 00:06:50.651
So Andy came one day to buy carpets and I was like really in awe this guy.

112
00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:54.470
It was how he talks about the future.
And then I said,

113
00:06:54.471 --> 00:06:56.900
I'm angel investing and nobody was giving them money.

114
00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:01.970
So somehow I became the first investor in Anglian math and Joe Britt and as you

115
00:07:01.971 --> 00:07:05.180
know,
Andy went on and go android.
Um,

116
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.300
I'm actually the only person in rural gives android a term sheet where we didn't

117
00:07:08.301 --> 00:07:09.190
agree on terms with.

118
00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.400
So you could be a good investor but miss big opportunities.

119
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.450
So fast forward I ended up being an investor in the first investor in Dropbox

120
00:07:17.451 --> 00:07:18.080
lending club.

121
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:23.080
They injured and many others and in around 2011 12 after like 1112 years doing

122
00:07:24.021 --> 00:07:27.500
this,
I felt that uh,
companies are raising a million dollar bus.

123
00:07:27.501 --> 00:07:29.840
Nobody's helping founders.
And you know,

124
00:07:29.841 --> 00:07:32.570
I thought given my background and network,
it's an,

125
00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:37.250
it's a huge opportunity to build an institution to help founders on ground zero.

126
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:40.280
And I wanted to partner with somebody who build companies.

127
00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.130
I have a deep tech background and have same philosophy in life.

128
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:47.810
So I've reached out to mar and I tried to convince her for a few years and you

129
00:07:47.811 --> 00:07:50.360
know,
we built this partnership,
you're kind of ying and Yang,
you know,

130
00:07:50.361 --> 00:07:53.260
I'm college rough house,
she's a Stanford fuge time.

131
00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:57.560
I invested in a hundred 20th startups before the starting the fund.

132
00:07:57.561 --> 00:08:02.060
Mar invested in only one but very the skills and the same philosophy in life,

133
00:08:02.061 --> 00:08:05.750
like helping people and really be good.
Give first before you get.

134
00:08:05.751 --> 00:08:10.270
And I think it remains to be seen,
but peer is now perhaps at the,
you know,

135
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:14.300
center of ecosystem here in the valley to just help founders on really early

136
00:08:14.301 --> 00:08:14.700
stages.

137
00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:18.300
If you have done so many different probes that we can talk about it and it's,

138
00:08:18.301 --> 00:08:20.600
it's amazing to be here.
I remember,
you know,

139
00:08:20.601 --> 00:08:22.550
my partners are own Medallian rug reality.

140
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:26.630
They're owned one 65 university avenue,
the lucky building.
Google started there.

141
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:29.870
So I saw Google their number hundred 20 versus today,

142
00:08:29.871 --> 00:08:31.310
I don't know how many thousand people.

143
00:08:31.311 --> 00:08:34.010
So it's pretty amazing to be part of this community.

144
00:08:34.011 --> 00:08:35.400
We are really honored and humbled.

145
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:40.460
Pejman you mentioned that you worked at the rug shop and then you sort of use

146
00:08:40.461 --> 00:08:45.050
that opportunity to transition into doing a VC by working with your clients.

147
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.680
I think in Silicon Valley a lot of the times there's a divide between tech

148
00:08:48.681 --> 00:08:51.380
employees or tech workers and everyone else.

149
00:08:51.381 --> 00:08:56.010
So maybe you wouldn't have necessarily CEO speaking,
forming genuine

150
00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:00.210
<v 0>relationships with people working at a coffee shop or a serving tables at a</v>

151
00:09:00.211 --> 00:09:03.390
restaurant.
Um,
we're working in sales at a store.

152
00:09:03.391 --> 00:09:06.750
So how were you able to bridge that divide that exists?

153
00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:10.590
You know,
I think I'm good at making friends.

154
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:13.440
So once you become friends with these people,
that lesson too.

155
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:17.490
So I wasn't going to people's home selling carpets the same time,

156
00:09:17.491 --> 00:09:19.970
say I'm investing as good together.
Uh,

157
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:22.440
it was just building the relationship and I was very,
uh,

158
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:26.190
paying a lot of attention to build that very concrete relationship with my,

159
00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:27.271
you know,

160
00:09:27.271 --> 00:09:31.340
my customers who are like few of them are advisors to our fun now and then a few

161
00:09:31.341 --> 00:09:34.230
of them invested for our funds,
so there became LP North Fund.

162
00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:38.010
So it's very important to build this very authentic relationship with whoever

163
00:09:38.011 --> 00:09:40.090
you work with.
Um,
so that,

164
00:09:40.091 --> 00:09:44.580
that was the genesis of my relationship with my clients.

165
00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:49.380
We'll became going investor with me.
He also throw great parties.

166
00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.600
Yes,
you're a party.
Everyone loves Persian food.

167
00:09:51.601 --> 00:09:56.601
So whenever people come to throwing great parties as a secret and inviting their

168
00:09:57.601 --> 00:10:01.780
spouses,
then everybody goes home.
And Mark,

169
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:06.370
you mentioned that you did a start up that initially didn't do well.
Uh,

170
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.780
one of the questions that comes up when I talk about startups with my friends,

171
00:10:09.781 --> 00:10:13.650
a lot of them being people of Color and women is that they're concerned that

172
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:15.930
especially for first time founders,

173
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:19.200
there is some bias from the VC world.

174
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:24.420
And I was wondering if you experienced any of that during your first startup and

175
00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:25.793
to what extent?

176
00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:31.220
<v 1>You know,
it wasn't very different time.
I think when I,
when I left school,</v>

177
00:10:31.221 --> 00:10:34.940
which is the year 2000,
the standard way of doing a company,

178
00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:40.490
whether you were a female or you know or not,
didn't really matter.

179
00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:45.500
There was a tech person and the standard was we'll bring a CEO to run the

180
00:10:45.501 --> 00:10:48.530
company and you will be the CTO.
And you know,

181
00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.780
that's the way companies were run at the time.

182
00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:54.200
And it has changed a lot right now.
That's not the philosophy.

183
00:10:54.201 --> 00:10:58.190
People that understand that in good companies,
the CTO,

184
00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:02.180
the founder stays with the company all the way and they're the CEO and they're

185
00:11:02.181 --> 00:11:06.830
the one driving the company.
And that's what Pashman and I believe,
you know,

186
00:11:06.831 --> 00:11:08.840
I think we are,
you know,
we,

187
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:13.700
we invest in a lot of companies where the founders are either just out of

188
00:11:13.701 --> 00:11:14.021
school.

189
00:11:14.021 --> 00:11:19.021
So it's definitely first time founders or maybe there are a few years out of

190
00:11:19.101 --> 00:11:22.460
school and they've had a couple of jobs,
but it's their first day.

191
00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:24.470
And that's what I see we're really good at,

192
00:11:24.471 --> 00:11:29.471
which is taking people that are amazing and then teaching them how to your

193
00:11:29.991 --> 00:11:34.100
fares,
sales pitch and fundraise.
It's not rocket science.

194
00:11:34.101 --> 00:11:39.020
I think smart people can learn it with the right support.
And that's our role.

195
00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.020
Right.
Um,
so anyways,
that's us.

196
00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:47.000
I did an encounter any sort of,
you know,
issues or I didn't feel them.

197
00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:50.960
Let me say that when I was fundraising or not.
It's more,
you know,

198
00:11:50.961 --> 00:11:54.130
I probably was more in the workplace,
but not when I was

199
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.180
<v 0>a founder in the role of a founder.
And do you think,</v>

200
00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:02.170
I know you worked at Stanford,
yeah.
Machine,
in addition to doing your phd,

201
00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:04.270
did that experience in academia,

202
00:12:04.271 --> 00:12:07.570
do you think that helped you with during VC work now?

203
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:10.150
A surprisingly yes.

204
00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:16.340
<v 2>Um,
you know,
actually when I used to teach circuit design,
so it's very tacky.</v>

205
00:12:16.341 --> 00:12:18.500
But you know,
you're really,

206
00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:21.920
a lot of what we do is teaching in some way is transferring knowledge.

207
00:12:21.921 --> 00:12:23.000
Sometimes it's our knowledge,

208
00:12:23.001 --> 00:12:27.350
sometimes it's transferring knowledge of other people to our founders.
So,

209
00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:28.213
um,

210
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:32.630
it's similar to what you do when you are either guiding somebody in a research

211
00:12:32.631 --> 00:12:37.170
project or teaching them maybe once a transistor for the first time.
Uh,

212
00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:41.360
there's a lot of that,
you know,
coaching that we do and you do this.

213
00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.510
I did the same at Stanford for many,
many years.
So yes.

214
00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:47.240
And I want to talk about that.
So I mean,

215
00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:49.250
giving credit to Mara and then the bringing,

216
00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:54.470
being a lecturer and a founder and having a deep technical expertise really

217
00:12:54.471 --> 00:12:57.800
helped for us to really understand the opportunities exist and really help

218
00:12:57.801 --> 00:12:58.634
founders.

219
00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:02.300
One of our portfolio companies is a company called one concern to just close it,

220
00:13:02.301 --> 00:13:05.090
massive $20 million series a.
And then,
you know,

221
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:07.970
Mara really found them as a poster session at Stanford.
They were,

222
00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:13.130
they were pitching their phd thesis and Marissa and opportunity that,

223
00:13:13.131 --> 00:13:15.920
that the groundbreaking technology they have,

224
00:13:15.921 --> 00:13:19.430
they can convert it to a commercial company.
They didn't believe it.

225
00:13:19.431 --> 00:13:20.600
They came to our office.

226
00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:25.630
And then fast forward now are becoming a media category defining company.

227
00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:31.470
<v 0>You guys have done a lot of work at Stanford,
especially with the garage program,</v>

228
00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:35.820
trying to get students to make startups during the summer and see if they can go

229
00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:38.100
even further beyond the summer work they do.

230
00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:43.110
Di Did you decide that you wanted to work with students before starting that

231
00:13:43.111 --> 00:13:47.760
program or was the success that you saw in that program sort of the driver for

232
00:13:47.761 --> 00:13:52.260
the work that you do,
the outreach that you do now?
Um,
let Pejman talk,

233
00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:56.540
<v 2>you know,
I think there's,
there,
there are few backgrounds at history.</v>

234
00:13:56.541 --> 00:14:00.080
So when I started to be like,
man,
I ain't started investing in Andy.

235
00:14:00.081 --> 00:14:02.320
I need a few million dollars to start today.

236
00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:05.780
Basically you don't need money to start.
As long as there's a laptop,

237
00:14:05.781 --> 00:14:10.520
there's a Starbucks and you know,
AWS and Google drive,
then you don't die.

238
00:14:10.521 --> 00:14:14.300
You can start a company.
So for that I needed so much capital out there.

239
00:14:14.301 --> 00:14:17.000
So there's a lot of noise.
If you're a seed investor like us,

240
00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.400
how do you look at this landscape of so many founders?

241
00:14:19.401 --> 00:14:21.290
How do you pick the winners?
Um,

242
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:24.410
so luckily Mara and I started the fund because of our background with a very

243
00:14:24.411 --> 00:14:25.870
good deal flow.
But uh,

244
00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:29.030
we thought it in order to increase the quality of our deal flow,

245
00:14:29.031 --> 00:14:33.320
it's great to go inside communities that are already filtered.

246
00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:36.890
And Stanford was the obvious choice.
Plus Mar was there.

247
00:14:36.891 --> 00:14:40.430
And then I found a few companies and the first thing we wanted to build the

248
00:14:40.431 --> 00:14:44.180
community over that and we thought it would be great that actually Mara Life for

249
00:14:44.181 --> 00:14:45.990
the garage program,
we didn't have any business value.

250
00:14:45.991 --> 00:14:50.000
We thought if you have like exceptional students under one roof,

251
00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:54.320
something good will.
So yeah,
no,
you had to go ahead.

252
00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.680
It's a garage is a program that every year we select up to 20 students from

253
00:14:57.681 --> 00:15:01.800
Stanford,
from,
it could be freshman all the way to your graduate or post doc.

254
00:15:01.801 --> 00:15:02.031
Right.

255
00:15:02.031 --> 00:15:06.860
And basically these are typically people in computer science and engineering

256
00:15:06.861 --> 00:15:07.694
departments.

257
00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:10.850
You don't need to have an idea as long as you want to be an entrepreneur.

258
00:15:10.851 --> 00:15:15.770
So we select these 20 students for nine months while academic year we give you a

259
00:15:15.771 --> 00:15:20.150
space mentorship and we really help you find problems you're passionate to solve

260
00:15:20.151 --> 00:15:23.260
and help you build the product.
No expectation to build the company,

261
00:15:23.261 --> 00:15:25.850
no expectation to fundraise but naturally happen.

262
00:15:25.851 --> 00:15:29.720
So this is the fourth year we are doing it and we don't take any equity in these

263
00:15:29.721 --> 00:15:32.570
companies.
We don't invest.
We give him a lot of resources.

264
00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:35.660
They come to our office once every two weeks to checking,

265
00:15:35.661 --> 00:15:39.350
meet our team and their mentors.
And already six companies came out of it.

266
00:15:39.351 --> 00:15:42.200
One of them is our portfolio company.
One was sold to uh,

267
00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:45.550
Palentier more actually negotiated the terms with Fallon therapy.

268
00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:49.730
It makes $0 million,
but those two founders came back and did our founders,

269
00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:53.630
our portfolio companies.
And because of that,
I think this community is growing.

270
00:15:53.631 --> 00:15:54.620
And you know,

271
00:15:54.621 --> 00:15:58.760
the philosophy you give before you get your kind of under the skin of Stanford

272
00:15:58.761 --> 00:16:00.590
now.
And we see things before.
Anybody else

273
00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.740
as part of your mission statement that's on pairs website,

274
00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:07.540
you also mentioned that she wanted to recruit it to him,
but he didn't call me.

275
00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:14.510
I had a lot on my plate.
Uh,
in Paris mission statement.

276
00:16:14.511 --> 00:16:17.600
You also mentioned that you're looking for founders that have unusual

277
00:16:17.601 --> 00:16:18.171
backgrounds.

278
00:16:18.171 --> 00:16:23.171
Can you speak a little bit to why you decide to focus on that aspect of founders

279
00:16:23.571 --> 00:16:26.930
and maybe some examples of what you mean by unusual backgrounds?

280
00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:31.980
<v 1>Yeah.
You know,
I think venture is really interesting because,
um,</v>

281
00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:34.810
especially for engineers,
I think it's very interesting.

282
00:16:34.811 --> 00:16:37.620
On the first time I went into venture I said,
oh,

283
00:16:37.621 --> 00:16:41.220
I'll just like look at all the variables about like what makes a company

284
00:16:41.221 --> 00:16:42.090
successful.

285
00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:47.300
So I spent a bunch of time collecting data on actually semiconductor companies.

286
00:16:47.381 --> 00:16:50.400
So we're a decade and you know,
I would like record.

287
00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.160
I think I had like maybe 40 variables per company.

288
00:16:53.161 --> 00:16:58.161
And then I did some simple regression and I tried a few models anyways.

289
00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:00.690
Uh,
and you're like,
great,

290
00:17:00.691 --> 00:17:04.620
I have a model and now I can predict what's the next winter.
Right on.

291
00:17:04.621 --> 00:17:09.150
It's almost the opposite.
We are a business off exceptions,
truly have exceptions.

292
00:17:09.151 --> 00:17:13.710
And the really,
really big winners,
they are just almost unpredictable,
right?

293
00:17:13.711 --> 00:17:17.980
So on,
it's almost interesting,
but you know,
um,

294
00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:22.890
I'll tell you,
you know,
that the movie about Facebook came out on for a while,

295
00:17:22.891 --> 00:17:27.020
then people thought,
oh,
I must just fun dropouts from,
uh,
uh,

296
00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:31.350
MIT or Stanford and well are guaranteed to hit a success.
Right?

297
00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:35.010
And you know,
now people are kind of coming back out of that and saying,
no,

298
00:17:35.011 --> 00:17:37.830
maybe you should find people in their thirties and they're more successful.

299
00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:41.460
So anyways,
um,
I,
my,
you know,

300
00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:46.140
the bottom line is that there's no formula.
I think everybody's different.
Um,

301
00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:49.740
and we really liked people that,
you know,
they're,

302
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:55.050
they're almost like unusual and they've not gone a straight path.
Uh,
you know,
so,

303
00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:57.270
you know,
for example,
you know,
somebody,

304
00:17:57.271 --> 00:18:01.320
we just hired somebody who was a chef for some time.
Some of our,

305
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:03.940
one of our founders,
um,

306
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:07.290
who runs a big company called Mimi Boston ecommerce companies,

307
00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:11.900
very large in Asia.
He was,
you know,
in Afghanistan for awhile.

308
00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:13.790
And he was an engineer.
But the Sida,

309
00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:17.970
he truly wanted to go into fashion and went to the Parsons school and worked for

310
00:18:17.971 --> 00:18:21.570
Tom Ford.
So it's somebody that it was not like,
you know,

311
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:26.200
something that you would predict easily.
So anyways,
that's a,

312
00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:30.480
everybody's different.
This company that Panama was mentioned in one concern,

313
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:35.870
which basically they're using artificial intelligence to predict and case of an

314
00:18:36.841 --> 00:18:39.370
earthquake or a flood where the big damage is.

315
00:18:39.371 --> 00:18:43.260
So you can send emergency responders very easily and you can do prevention,

316
00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:47.180
right?
So this guy,
you know,
as from Kashmir,
he lives in,
he,

317
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:51.840
he lived all his life and this little village,
he suffered earthquakes,

318
00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:56.930
floods.
He spent literally like five days on the roof of his home.
Um,

319
00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:02.120
and he knew that he wanted to actually do something to avoid being in the same

320
00:19:02.791 --> 00:19:05.410
situation again.
So again,

321
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:09.210
just somebody with a special background that you want to fund and contribute.

322
00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.100
And I don't know if you want something to add.

323
00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.560
<v 2>You know,
I think on a broader spectrum,
you'll,</v>

324
00:19:13.561 --> 00:19:15.630
if you look at the venture capital community,

325
00:19:15.631 --> 00:19:18.540
there are a lot of people claim to venture capitalists,

326
00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:23.550
but they're more capitalist,
venture Catholic.
And,
and the reason is,
I mean,

327
00:19:23.551 --> 00:19:27.420
especially when you combine the,
actually I met another person yesterday,

328
00:19:27.421 --> 00:19:29.630
they said,
um,
I said,
well,

329
00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:34.350
how do you look at companies you said is no product risk and then no market
risk.

330
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:39.300
So,
and I thought,
wow,
so how can be a venture capitalist to do this things?
So,

331
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:43.170
and in our business you live for the moment that somebody walks at your door and

332
00:19:43.171 --> 00:19:47.340
surprise you and you break all the rules.
Um,
you know,

333
00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:51.600
no terms is important.
Everything you've learned doesn't fit there.

334
00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:54.060
I really want to partner with that particular person.

335
00:19:54.061 --> 00:19:56.670
And if you look at the biggest company ever created,

336
00:19:56.671 --> 00:19:58.350
the founders very in that category.

337
00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:03.470
<v 0>So there's probably people here in this room that may be interested in doing a</v>

338
00:20:03.471 --> 00:20:06.080
startup at some point,
or maybe people watching online.

339
00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:11.330
And you went a little bit into this with talking about finding people who are

340
00:20:11.331 --> 00:20:12.440
special and unusual.

341
00:20:12.441 --> 00:20:17.441
But in terms of the type of company or how a company approaches the market,

342
00:20:18.591 --> 00:20:21.770
do you have anything that you look for in the companies and startups that you

343
00:20:21.771 --> 00:20:22.880
were,
uh,
funding?

344
00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:28.250
<v 1>Maybe let me say something else about the founders because it's,
it's not,</v>

345
00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:32.330
you know,
it's not only like,
hey,
you have a,
uh,
an unusual background.
We take you,

346
00:20:32.331 --> 00:20:34.560
it's not just like that.
Um,

347
00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:37.880
I think the founders that we work with at the very beginning,

348
00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:41.900
just imagine you are in our position,
there's people that come in,

349
00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:46.550
they have nothing.
There might be a prototype,
but there's really nothing.
Right.

350
00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:48.310
And they come in and they're like,

351
00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:53.050
we want money to build our business and we think it's going to be great.
So,
um,

352
00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:57.220
you know,
we're just judging that a founder or founders.
Right.

353
00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:00.850
And one of the characteristics that I think is very important is this,

354
00:21:00.851 --> 00:21:04.870
people are so mission driven.
They're obsessed with what they're doing.

355
00:21:04.871 --> 00:21:08.320
It's like they can't sleep at night because they have to go to this company.

356
00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:11.830
And I think when you're obsessed and completely mission driven,

357
00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:17.030
there's a lot of other things that fall from it,
right?
Like your focus,

358
00:21:17.031 --> 00:21:17.980
then you know,

359
00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:21.130
you're spending all your time doing this and so on that really matter.

360
00:21:21.131 --> 00:21:23.500
But this obsession is really,
really important.

361
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:29.020
And I'll go back to your question about I think the market,
um,
you know,

362
00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:32.800
sometimes there's no market but we can fast and companies we just don't even

363
00:21:32.801 --> 00:21:35.020
know.
You know,
you're creating a new market.

364
00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:40.470
So for us it's hard to look at even a financial model or unit economics or

365
00:21:41.621 --> 00:21:46.540
margins or anything.
We just have to believe that you could get there.
Right?

366
00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:47.440
Um,

367
00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:51.910
but we liked people that almost like how a police action driven,

368
00:21:51.911 --> 00:21:55.510
so they have a plan.
So it's not randomly things happen.
They're like,
Hey,

369
00:21:55.511 --> 00:21:58.000
I'm going to try this.
Almost like a math mind.
I'm like,

370
00:21:58.001 --> 00:22:01.600
I'm trying to have some sort of hypotheses and it might not work and it might

371
00:22:01.601 --> 00:22:04.410
work,
but if not,
I'm going to try this.
And so on and taught and,
right.

372
00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:07.480
And it's almost like this constant learning loop that they have.

373
00:22:07.481 --> 00:22:12.160
And it's not just like I'm doing a company and let's see what happens.
Basically.

374
00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:13.123
Go ahead.

375
00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:14.490
<v 2>No,
what are you think smart?</v>

376
00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:18.290
Like when you look at the founders would be like to work with are some common

377
00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:22.640
characteristics.
We like founders or really close to the problem they're solving.

378
00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:27.950
Typically even people come and they said we had 20 ideas narrowed down to 10 and

379
00:22:27.951 --> 00:22:30.410
we pick this one.
It's kind of a red flag.

380
00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:34.130
He liked people who have lived through that problem or they have academic

381
00:22:34.131 --> 00:22:37.550
background or you have faced those challenges here at Google.

382
00:22:37.551 --> 00:22:38.450
You're building a good product,

383
00:22:38.451 --> 00:22:42.110
but do you see a huge opportunity to do something?
So we really want to see that.

384
00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:46.990
We liked the teams who have,
um,
you know,
history together,
uh,
the,

385
00:22:46.991 --> 00:22:50.750
or broke that Google or the rock climb every weekend or they went to the same

386
00:22:50.751 --> 00:22:55.460
high school.
And as,
as Mara mentioned,
people who have a vision,
many founders,

387
00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:56.780
they think they have a vision,

388
00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:01.010
but it just having a goal of raising more money in two years.

389
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:02.240
So it's a very different,

390
00:23:02.241 --> 00:23:05.930
and we pay lots of attention to figure out why you're doing this.

391
00:23:05.931 --> 00:23:09.740
I think most of most of startup doesn't work.
Why,

392
00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.710
why you want to go through these things.
And it's,

393
00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:16.010
it's a very important question that we ask.
Um,

394
00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:20.630
and so it was combination of characteristic of the founders we want to see in

395
00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:25.250
the teams that you're working with them has been a lot of talk recently in the

396
00:23:25.251 --> 00:23:29.390
news about the importance of company culture and making sure that you foster a

397
00:23:29.391 --> 00:23:34.160
good culture from an early stage because otherwise in the long run potentially

398
00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:38.420
you could be facing problems.
So since you guys work with early stage companies,

399
00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:42.410
are there things that you see that can be done since the beginning of a company

400
00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:47.450
to help create that good culture?
To avoid problems?
Yeah,

401
00:23:47.451 --> 00:23:50.890
I think everybody talks about it and nobody defines what it is.
And the culture.

402
00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:53.810
I mean in the scope of Google,
the days when,
when your startup,
what is it?

403
00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:57.950
Is it a ping pong table or is free food and,

404
00:23:57.951 --> 00:24:00.710
and I think it should be defined by the founding team.

405
00:24:00.711 --> 00:24:04.130
And I think culture could be different in any set of companies,

406
00:24:04.131 --> 00:24:07.850
but it's set of principles that you believe in and you stick to it.

407
00:24:07.851 --> 00:24:10.130
And it could be very different.
And you know,

408
00:24:10.131 --> 00:24:12.050
one of the companies are broke like 10 years ago.

409
00:24:12.051 --> 00:24:16.010
It was an amazing CEO and the culture was all about transparency.

410
00:24:16.011 --> 00:24:21.011
And I remember it every Friday they had barbecue and he put himself in front of

411
00:24:21.741 --> 00:24:25.610
the company and everybody can ask any question from the cur,
criticize him.

412
00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:29.180
That's one way to do it.
The other way is,
you know,

413
00:24:29.181 --> 00:24:33.700
people say that is all about our customers.
I think we should service them in.

414
00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:37.460
So this is a set of different principles that you should create and you should

415
00:24:37.461 --> 00:24:38.294
stick to it.

416
00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:40.950
<v 1>But I seen them,
most of us to spend the time doing it.</v>

417
00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:43.800
The second time you have a company you realize that's really,
really,

418
00:24:43.801 --> 00:24:46.770
really important.
And when you have this principles,

419
00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:51.480
it almost applies to everything.
How you recruit,
how you treat your customers,

420
00:24:51.481 --> 00:24:52.460
how you run your meeting.

421
00:24:52.461 --> 00:24:57.120
So it's super critical to have that conversation and you can get help get

422
00:24:57.121 --> 00:25:00.660
coaches to exactly what that means because if you've never done it,

423
00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:03.930
maybe just don't know how to do it,
but critical.

424
00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:08.900
<v 0>And do you have any advice for people who are,
uh,</v>

425
00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:11.250
in early stage companies trying to get funding,

426
00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:14.640
particularly maybe if they come from immigrant backgrounds,

427
00:25:14.641 --> 00:25:17.910
if they're people of color or women talk to us first?

428
00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:24.680
<v 1>Yes.
Um,
yeah,
I think the most,
you know,</v>

429
00:25:24.681 --> 00:25:29.030
I think the great thing about the valley,
especially if you're here all right,
um,

430
00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:33.320
is that you can get a lot of help.
People are typically very,
very helpful.

431
00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:37.160
So,
um,
you know,
you're like almost,
you know,

432
00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:40.750
even a block away from anybody that can,
you know,

433
00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:44.510
help you either with your business plan or is this a good idea or not?

434
00:25:44.511 --> 00:25:47.600
Or research you can get out there these days.

435
00:25:47.601 --> 00:25:51.950
There's so many things for founders and entrepreneurs and events.

436
00:25:51.951 --> 00:25:56.180
I think passionate and I can be out every night and every day meeting people.

437
00:25:56.181 --> 00:25:59.750
So I think if you really start from nothing,
I would say,
you know,

438
00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:01.900
I reach out for help to your network.

439
00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:05.530
<v 0>And I think a lot of times people are really hesitant to reach out.</v>

440
00:26:05.531 --> 00:26:10.531
But I've been surprised how responsive people are to an email or even if you

441
00:26:10.611 --> 00:26:11.381
like tweet them,

442
00:26:11.381 --> 00:26:14.980
they might reply and then you start fostering a relationship over time.

443
00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:18.440
<v 1>I think one of the things that's so important for founders to know is that</v>

444
00:26:18.441 --> 00:26:21.320
there's a lot of rejection when you do entrepreneurship,

445
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:24.770
whether it's raising money or getting our customers.
Sometimes people will come,

446
00:26:24.771 --> 00:26:25.604
it's like,
oh,
I've read,

447
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000
I've sent a 500 emails are through Linkedin and I got two responses and they're

448
00:26:31.671 --> 00:26:35.600
like devastated.
I'm like,
well,
you got to,
that's awesome.
Right?
So,

449
00:26:35.601 --> 00:26:38.870
and it's really hard at the beginning to get somebody to listen to you,

450
00:26:38.871 --> 00:26:43.410
but the good founders,
because they're obsessed,
they don't give up.
Right.

451
00:26:43.411 --> 00:26:45.540
And they're like,
okay,
maybe linkedin was not the right way.

452
00:26:45.541 --> 00:26:49.740
I should do this other thing or whatever.
Anyway,
so same when you start,

453
00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:51.840
<v 0>do you approach uh,</v>

454
00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:56.030
how you look at first time founders differently than how you approach people who

455
00:26:56.031 --> 00:26:59.310
have had several startups potentially or who have pivoted?

456
00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:03.870
<v 2>Know our approach is not a different the same way,
but obviously the,</v>

457
00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:06.380
at different stages you need different types of help.

458
00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:10.380
If you are in a second or third time founder or maybe you need an introduction

459
00:27:10.381 --> 00:27:13.170
from us to a see you off a public company and they take it.

460
00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:16.590
But if you're a first time founder you need to put an operations plan together

461
00:27:16.591 --> 00:27:21.300
with us.
So it all depends of the maturity of the founders.
So you,

462
00:27:21.301 --> 00:27:23.700
and we've worked with both of them.
If you look at our portfolio companies,

463
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:25.680
you have a lot of first time founder,

464
00:27:25.681 --> 00:27:28.940
but we have founding team that are second or third time they're starting to
come.

465
00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:30.213
<v 3>Okay.</v>

466
00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:36.070
<v 0>Another thing that I really appreciate about pair as a firm is that you place a</v>

467
00:27:36.071 --> 00:27:41.020
lot of emphasis on the immigrant experience and especially right now in today's

468
00:27:41.021 --> 00:27:44.740
political climate,
I think that's really important.
And it's also very courageous.

469
00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:49.540
And I was wondering if there's been any impact from the current political

470
00:27:49.541 --> 00:27:52.090
climate on your work with pair of,

471
00:27:52.091 --> 00:27:57.091
you've seen maybe changes in the people who are pitching to you or any changes

472
00:27:57.281 --> 00:27:59.170
in the people that ultimately get funded.

473
00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:01.030
<v 3>Okay.</v>

474
00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:03.930
<v 1>You know,
I think the impact is on our companies.
Yeah.
I see him.</v>

475
00:28:03.931 --> 00:28:07.990
We have founders that can't go home.
Um,
and you know,
I,

476
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.650
that's a big deal.
If you can't go home to see your sister get married,

477
00:28:11.651 --> 00:28:16.270
I think that's a big deal.
Right.
So,
um,
at a personal level,
you know,

478
00:28:16.271 --> 00:28:18.280
we've had to,
you know,
try to,
you know,

479
00:28:18.281 --> 00:28:21.070
I'm went on to have a large immigration department and like maybe your HR,

480
00:28:21.071 --> 00:28:26.050
like Google does.
Right.
So we've gotten involved on,
you know,
how to help them.

481
00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:29.230
But,
um,
so that at a,
you know,

482
00:28:29.231 --> 00:28:32.380
we have stories that have happened without,
we don't,

483
00:28:32.381 --> 00:28:36.700
haven't seen necessarily a change in the people that come pitch to us,

484
00:28:36.701 --> 00:28:40.520
cause you know,
they're either,
some of them are,
um,

485
00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:43.930
either on an h one or they're just finishing school.

486
00:28:43.931 --> 00:28:48.931
So then an n o p t visas or whatnot but passionate and I are experts are writing

487
00:28:48.971 --> 00:28:52.480
all these letters of recommendation that you know,

488
00:28:52.481 --> 00:28:54.700
for our founders and I think a lot of them are,

489
00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:58.930
have been able to get them anyways.
It's not good news cause mine is very uh,

490
00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:00.790
you know,
committed to this cost.

491
00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:07.150
<v 2>I came 24 years ago as an Iranian and Muslim and my immigration status after I</v>

492
00:29:08.511 --> 00:29:10.580
came was unknown.
But you know,

493
00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:14.840
American never judged me I think gave me all the opportunity to thrive and I

494
00:29:14.841 --> 00:29:18.030
still feel the same thing.
I hope this spirit of America is,

495
00:29:18.031 --> 00:29:20.900
stays debate when I arrived here 24 years ago.

496
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:24.260
And I think if you look at this room even,
um,

497
00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:28.430
and what Google people doing in Silicon Valley is just a testament of that

498
00:29:28.431 --> 00:29:29.264
spirit.

499
00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:30.870
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

500
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:35.870
<v 0>I think sometimes it can be difficult to bring up once background or maybe make</v>

501
00:29:35.971 --> 00:29:38.940
connections to things like your immigrant background.

502
00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:41.800
Given the political climate,

503
00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:47.340
<v 2>how do you approach deciding when to speak up about something or what to say in</v>

504
00:29:48.521 --> 00:29:52.630
response to certain issues?
How do you balance those things?

505
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:56.380
I was learned to stand up for my rights and whatever it is.

506
00:29:56.381 --> 00:30:00.740
And I think very car is,
it's a great country that your,

507
00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:03.520
your voice is heard.
If you just raise your voice.

508
00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:08.770
I'm not hesitant to raise my voice when I want to stand up for my rights.

509
00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:11.590
And when you do that,
do that,

510
00:30:11.591 --> 00:30:15.580
do you see support from fellow people in the industry or have there been

511
00:30:15.581 --> 00:30:18.040
instances?
Yeah,
very much so.
I think especially in the valley,

512
00:30:18.041 --> 00:30:20.320
you get so much support from the people here.

513
00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:25.300
I mean it's almost everybody's immigrant to grandfather back with three.

514
00:30:25.301 --> 00:30:29.800
So No,
I've got to always have a huge support and I still,

515
00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:34.900
even though the political climate is changed by Trump,

516
00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:36.360
um,
I know,

517
00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:39.820
just don't feel it in Silicon Valley's happening is the same silicon valley.

518
00:30:39.821 --> 00:30:41.680
I know for last 24 years.

519
00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:46.820
What as mark mentioned is just very difficult.
I think.
Um,
you know,

520
00:30:46.821 --> 00:30:51.440
I'm from Iran and Iran,
um,
has a university I think by here,

521
00:30:51.441 --> 00:30:55.160
has gone to at Sharif University,
has the highest acceptance of Phd at Stanford,

522
00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:59.210
the devil lead department at Marvin.
Yes.
People are deciding not to come here,

523
00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:01.380
they go to Canada.
I go to,
to England.

524
00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:05.210
So I think at the end America is losing a lot of amazing talents from all over

525
00:31:05.211 --> 00:31:06.044
the world.

526
00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:07.890
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

527
00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:10.110
<v 1>and by maybe I should say something,</v>

528
00:31:10.111 --> 00:31:14.110
I think sometimes we do get founders that come and say I have a visa issue or,

529
00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:18.180
and I think passionate and I once we find somebody we want,

530
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:22.970
we'll do whatever we can to help this person.
It's not snow,

531
00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:24.720
snow show stopper for us,
you know,

532
00:31:24.721 --> 00:31:26.610
someone will try whatever we can to get them in.

533
00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:32.900
<v 2>I know both of you are really focused on giving back to the communities that you</v>

534
00:31:32.901 --> 00:31:33.770
identify with.

535
00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:36.770
And I was just wondering if maybe you could tell us a little bit about the ways

536
00:31:36.771 --> 00:31:41.180
in which you give back and your experience about why you do it and what you get

537
00:31:41.181 --> 00:31:44.290
from it.
Yeah.

538
00:31:44.291 --> 00:31:47.800
I think if we think of as the garage program,
that's an example of that.

539
00:31:47.801 --> 00:31:51.790
How much time and effort it takes from us and uh,

540
00:31:51.850 --> 00:31:56.320
without any specific requests of owning any,
um,

541
00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:58.210
ownership in this companies.

542
00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:01.510
So that really tells that we really wanted to give back,

543
00:32:01.511 --> 00:32:06.190
at least that particular community.
Um,
you know,

544
00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:10.820
it's specific Umar even though some of the companies we don't want to invest,

545
00:32:10.821 --> 00:32:14.710
she spent so much time.
If there's a company that we like them to,

546
00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:17.770
Stanford GSB,
business school founders,

547
00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:21.880
they wanted to get to YC and then mark spent the last two weeks coaching them

548
00:32:21.881 --> 00:32:24.340
how to get the YC and they got to YC yesterday.

549
00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:29.410
So I think that that tells you that you're all about helping founders at the
core

550
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.000
and you also don't necessarily see someone joining another firm as a negative.

551
00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:39.980
No,
no.
I mean,
I

552
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:44.180
<v 1>think it's a big world.
Companies lasts for a long time,</v>

553
00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:47.860
so you never know.
Right.
And I found her,
you know,

554
00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:50.210
it's rare that you stay in a company forever.

555
00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:54.530
You have many companies inside of you.
So we at the end,
you know,

556
00:32:54.531 --> 00:32:58.730
just wanting people to do well.
That's how I,
I see the world anyways.

557
00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.400
One company is not gonna make or break us.

558
00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:04.320
<v 2>Right.
Do you have any [inaudible] was Google.</v>

559
00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:05.333
<v 1>Yeah,
exactly.</v>

560
00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:09.430
<v 2>That was a spy out hold the cuff.</v>

561
00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:17.340
Do you have any stories about companies that you funded that you particularly

562
00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:22.120
saw great success in and maybe the qualities reflected in their success?

563
00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:27.190
<v 1>Um,
yeah,
maybe I'll talk about my,</v>

564
00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:31.980
the first company we actually did out of the fund,
it's called branch metric.

565
00:33:31.981 --> 00:33:35.760
It's,
it's a deep linking platform.
And,
um,

566
00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:40.830
I met them when they were students at school and so there were students,

567
00:33:40.901 --> 00:33:43.930
it was November,
so they were students,
we're still a long time,

568
00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:47.860
but the CEO presented what they were doing at the time,

569
00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:51.580
which was a mobile app to print the pictures,
um,

570
00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:54.250
which is completely different from a deep linking up.

571
00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:58.350
But they came and I rushed Depeche mode and they said,
[inaudible],

572
00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:01.840
we have to fund this guy.
I,
I don't,

573
00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:04.500
I don't really know what he's doing,
but he's a great,

574
00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:08.440
and I'm sure he's going to figure it out.
Right.
So,
um,

575
00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:12.020
that's how we got into branch.
Um,
he,

576
00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:15.580
they basically pivoted twice until they did what they did.

577
00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:20.380
But why did I sing and that first meeting that this guy,
you know,

578
00:34:20.381 --> 00:34:23.770
would be a great CEO and was not going to stop.
Right.
Um,

579
00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:27.130
he is what I call a data driven CEO.

580
00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:32.050
So everything he says is almost has a number and a reason why,
uh,

581
00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:36.460
so it's not hand wavy and he has done his homework and he kind of knows where

582
00:34:36.461 --> 00:34:38.350
he's going.
That's why I was like,

583
00:34:38.351 --> 00:34:42.220
I wanna work for this guy because I know that,
you know,

584
00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:44.530
we are going to go somewhere and if we don't get there,

585
00:34:44.531 --> 00:34:48.370
he'll turn around and figure it out.
And that's basically what he did.
I mean,

586
00:34:48.371 --> 00:34:50.980
it's pretty impressive.
Uh,
you know,

587
00:34:50.981 --> 00:34:54.070
the success of the company was not an accident.
Uh,

588
00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:59.160
the company pivoted twice into what they're doing and it was all really

589
00:34:59.561 --> 00:35:02.650
literally data driven decisions.
You know,
they're not getting in our customers,

590
00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:06.700
oh,
maybe we should build an Sdk for printing.
Oh,

591
00:35:06.701 --> 00:35:09.400
how do we get people to install it and open it in the right place?

592
00:35:09.401 --> 00:35:13.570
And that's how they eventually got into the blinking.
Um,

593
00:35:14.290 --> 00:35:18.800
anyways,
so that's one story.
I have many pesh mine.
Um,
um,

594
00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:22.290
<v 2>I think you mentioned that if you were telling me page one,</v>

595
00:35:22.291 --> 00:35:26.200
you start and get fund and you invest in the Korean cosmetic product and would

596
00:35:26.201 --> 00:35:29.080
have said I would never do it but until you meet,
you know,

597
00:35:29.081 --> 00:35:32.500
the founders of Mimi box.
So as mark mentioned,

598
00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:35.560
he studies computer science and Korea.
Uh,

599
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:38.010
then decided to go to

600
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:40.590
<v 1>serve in peace corporate Afghanistan,</v>

601
00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:45.620
then decided to go to work for Tom Ford and figure out that Korean cosmetic

602
00:35:46.141 --> 00:35:50.700
product people love it is after France is the second biggest market in the world

603
00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:53.610
of Korean cosmetic periscope on cheaper,
same quality.

604
00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:58.800
And he wanted to build in the brand that serves the entire world in fast forward

605
00:35:59.770 --> 00:36:03.240
this year there,
you know,
making a lot of money,
they might go public.

606
00:36:03.241 --> 00:36:08.241
So his desire to build something in a market that is so saturated,

607
00:36:09.010 --> 00:36:10.520
it was just stunning.

608
00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:14.820
And the quality of the found the who walks through the walls to make things

609
00:36:14.821 --> 00:36:16.920
happen.
It was just really,
really obvious in him.

610
00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:21.390
May I say one more founder's story cause I think those are the best stories.

611
00:36:21.391 --> 00:36:22.320
Not really ours,

612
00:36:22.321 --> 00:36:27.321
but we have a company called Aurora solar and it's founded by two immigrants

613
00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:31.740
Monas actually from Kenya.
And the other one is from Germany.
Um,

614
00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:36.480
this guy's met,
um,
at Stanford,
but the guy from Kenya,

615
00:36:36.481 --> 00:36:40.830
he had started a solar installation company in,
you know,

616
00:36:40.831 --> 00:36:45.390
in his home country.
And he was trying to actually,
uh,
you know,

617
00:36:45.391 --> 00:36:48.030
when he came here,
he tried to turn it into a business.

618
00:36:48.031 --> 00:36:53.031
So they realize that all this solar installation was very manual and you know,

619
00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:56.160
they could actually automate it.
We software today,

620
00:36:56.161 --> 00:37:01.161
they're the number one software use for any solar solar installation is actually

621
00:37:01.501 --> 00:37:06.400
super,
super tacky at impressive.
Um,
but anyways,
this guy,
I,

622
00:37:06.401 --> 00:37:09.870
uh,
this was in 2013 and time flies,

623
00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:14.670
but in 2013 if you said solar,
people were like,
oh no,
we can't talk to you.
Right.

624
00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:19.530
So,
um,
they were not,
they could not get any money.

625
00:37:19.531 --> 00:37:23.090
They could not get any place to live or,
you know,
like work out of,

626
00:37:23.091 --> 00:37:27.860
etc. So this guy,
you know,
Sam,
the founder,
called us like,
you know,

627
00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:28.680
almost begging,

628
00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:33.120
please let day in your office because we don't have anywhere to go.
And,
um,

629
00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:35.430
you know,
that's how we met him.
But you know,

630
00:37:35.431 --> 00:37:38.100
just the fact that he had the courage to come and say,

631
00:37:38.101 --> 00:37:42.000
I don't have anything and nobody really cares,
but you know,
lend me a hand.

632
00:37:42.001 --> 00:37:44.310
That was like a big deal.
Uh,
so again,

633
00:37:44.410 --> 00:37:48.960
this the sort of mentality that I'm going to work and so I want to bring solar

634
00:37:48.961 --> 00:37:52.230
energy to Kenya and I want to solve it and I'm working on this problem.

635
00:37:52.231 --> 00:37:55.020
I'm not going to give up.
Right.
So anyways,
and,

636
00:37:55.021 --> 00:37:58.500
and last year they were chosen number one software company and solar entire

637
00:37:58.501 --> 00:38:01.500
solar industry.
Huh.
Oh,
wow.
You're both

638
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:05.960
<v 0>talked about founders being very passionate about specific industries or</v>

639
00:38:05.961 --> 00:38:08.600
specific products.
Do you have anything,

640
00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:14.020
any opinion with regard to people who maybe aren't working on something that

641
00:38:14.511 --> 00:38:17.840
they're passionate about but they're doing it because maybe their financial

642
00:38:17.841 --> 00:38:22.841
circumstances require them to work in that or maybe they're trying to build up

643
00:38:22.911 --> 00:38:26.180
the skills to then do something that they're passionate about.
Uh,

644
00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:30.230
do you think there's a certain point in which doing that for too long can be a

645
00:38:30.231 --> 00:38:30.741
bad thing?

646
00:38:30.741 --> 00:38:35.440
And at what point do you make the decision to actually do something you're

647
00:38:35.441 --> 00:38:35.980
passionate

648
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:36.813
<v 2>about?</v>

649
00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:39.090
<v 1>I mean,
it really depends on people,</v>

650
00:38:39.091 --> 00:38:43.800
but I do think I do encourage people that the students that come out of school

651
00:38:43.801 --> 00:38:45.990
to go get a job and learn something,
you know,

652
00:38:45.991 --> 00:38:50.220
it's not my recommendation to go do a company right now,
right after school.

653
00:38:50.221 --> 00:38:51.270
It has to be a very,

654
00:38:51.271 --> 00:38:55.380
very special situation because I think you learn a lot by,

655
00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:58.830
you're not done right after school.
You're not completely done right.

656
00:38:58.890 --> 00:39:02.660
You are learning for the first five to 10 years of your career.

657
00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:05.340
Just really learning.
So the place,
you know,

658
00:39:05.341 --> 00:39:08.580
we pay so much attention as to what college we go,

659
00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:10.800
but I think the impact in your careers,

660
00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:15.420
the first job you have is much more impactful than necessarily what college you

661
00:39:15.421 --> 00:39:19.840
went to.
So,
um,
you know,
I'm totally supportive of that.

662
00:39:19.841 --> 00:39:22.710
And then that's the advice I give to most people.
Right?

663
00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:25.950
I think at some point in your life it gets really,

664
00:39:25.951 --> 00:39:30.330
really hard to go to a startup because of the circumstance of life.
You know,

665
00:39:30.331 --> 00:39:33.480
you're making a lot of money.
You have a family,

666
00:39:33.810 --> 00:39:37.590
maybe you're the only person in your family that's working,
so it's just harder.

667
00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:42.270
Right?
Again,
people that are super obsessed,
they figure it out,
right?
I mean,

668
00:39:42.271 --> 00:39:47.160
humans are very capable,
uh,
but it's harder,
right?
Anyways,

669
00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:50.220
<v 2>you know,
my,
my,
the same philosophy as mar has,</v>

670
00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:54.230
I mean I think sometimes you do a job that just pays for the bill and the
family.

671
00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:58.170
You might not really passionate,
but I think you can balance it.
If you like art,

672
00:39:58.171 --> 00:40:02.010
you can spend your weekend doing art.
If you like soccer,
like me,

673
00:40:02.011 --> 00:40:06.540
you can play soccer.
So I think Google is really good at it.
It's 80,
20 things.

674
00:40:06.541 --> 00:40:10.230
I don't know,
still going around or not,
but I think in balance your life,

675
00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:13.140
how are we still find your personal projects?

676
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:19.110
What about looking forward into the tech industry as a whole?

677
00:40:19.111 --> 00:40:24.111
Do you see any specific areas that have a potential for high growth in the

678
00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:28.300
coming years?
I mean,
um,
I let mark talk about the,

679
00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:32.820
the platform she be things is the future AI,
but I think it's,
um,

680
00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:34.081
I think,
we don't know.

681
00:40:34.081 --> 00:40:38.250
I think our motto is investors don't create future entrepreneurs do and we stick

682
00:40:38.251 --> 00:40:42.600
to it.
You think always entrepreneurs sees they see future before us.

683
00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:46.230
Um,
and we don't want to corner in ourself in any particular sector.

684
00:40:46.231 --> 00:40:49.440
And that's one of the reasons if you look at our portfolio companies,

685
00:40:49.441 --> 00:40:51.450
we have companies all over the map.

686
00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:55.770
And the reason is we really believe in the founders were solving a real problem

687
00:40:55.771 --> 00:40:56.670
in a big market.

688
00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:02.110
<v 1>Yeah.
It's really hard to predict the future,
to be honest.
It's really hard.</v>

689
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:06.100
Um,
and you know,
I know,
and there's a bad,
you know,

690
00:41:06.101 --> 00:41:09.280
we are surrounded by great investors that have thesises and so on,

691
00:41:09.281 --> 00:41:11.910
and sometimes they get it right,
sometimes they don't get it right.
Um,

692
00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:14.040
I'll tell you my story.
I,
you know,

693
00:41:14.041 --> 00:41:17.080
I was in the semiconductor business and you know,

694
00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:22.110
semiconductors was a great industry in the 90 days and then it almost died at

695
00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:26.400
all the venture firms in the valley.
We're funding semiconductor companies,
uh,

696
00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:30.350
and now nobody funds semiconductor companies.
Right?
So Pat,
I told,
you know,

697
00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:33.070
I thought I would never work in semiconductors again.

698
00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:37.430
The last company we did was in semiconductors.
So did you just never know.

699
00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:40.130
And again,
it's all based on the team.

700
00:41:40.131 --> 00:41:44.360
They had a convincing pitch of why that was a good opportunity and all the

701
00:41:44.361 --> 00:41:47.330
issues that,
you know,
one would face with semiconductors,

702
00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:51.890
which is kind of like forgot about them.
Um,
so anyways,
that's,

703
00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:54.600
<v 2>you know,
when we started the fund in 2013,</v>

704
00:41:54.601 --> 00:41:56.970
I think everyone was talking about block chain.

705
00:41:56.971 --> 00:42:00.990
And then six months after it was Iot,
then was drones.

706
00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:03.210
And today it's a,
I mean,

707
00:42:03.211 --> 00:42:06.540
one of the best with told me that if you sprinkled it with AI in your deck,

708
00:42:06.541 --> 00:42:11.070
you get funded.
Um,
so any information changes on pretty quickly.

709
00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:15.400
<v 1>Um,
we see it,
you know,
everybody's on AI something,
um,
where like,</v>

710
00:42:15.401 --> 00:42:18.150
well where's your,
do you have an engineer or something?
No,

711
00:42:18.151 --> 00:42:22.780
but we'll hire them like,
okay.
So anyways,
we get it.

712
00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:24.730
They get pounded us,
get it to,
they're smart.

713
00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:29.400
<v 0>What about VRN?
Autonomous.
Awesome.</v>

714
00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:34.660
<v 1>I almost,
I also heard something last week,
which is interesting.
Oh yeah,</v>

715
00:42:34.661 --> 00:42:37.560
I you go Thomas driving.
He was on its way down.
I'm like,
it hasn't even made it

716
00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:44.670
<v 0>cool.
So I think at this point we can open up to questions from the audience.</v>

717
00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:49.620
Like what percentage of women were participants in the garage program since

718
00:42:49.621 --> 00:42:51.980
you've done it for four years and do you do anything to try it

719
00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:56.400
<v 1>crude from that category?
Yes.
Um,
okay.
I'll tell you,</v>

720
00:42:56.401 --> 00:42:58.640
the first year we started garage,
um,

721
00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:03.510
we did it with the two people that had the ACM group at Stanford.

722
00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:05.580
And you know,
the way we started wearing like,
hey,

723
00:43:05.581 --> 00:43:09.180
why don't you come up with a list of 20 people that we could reach out to?
Right?

724
00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:14.160
So they came to us and,
and that 20 lists,
it was all guys like,

725
00:43:14.161 --> 00:43:18.720
okay guys,
we need some diversity in this group.
Right?

726
00:43:18.721 --> 00:43:23.721
So we had to force them to go find some women and I think we had in that garage

727
00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:29.250
group we had four women,
uh,
to actually work color,
which is great.

728
00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:33.330
Um,
but you know,
I was clearly not the majority cause we had about,
you know,

729
00:43:33.331 --> 00:43:37.290
15 to 20 people give or take.
And every year,

730
00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:42.400
the second year,
which we did a,
uh,
a call out for people,
uh,

731
00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:44.490
the same ratios to be honest,
right?

732
00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:48.210
We've tried really hard this year is actually going maybe the highest that we

733
00:43:48.211 --> 00:43:52.170
have in terms of ratio,
but it's always under 50% for sure.

734
00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:53.020
I would say around that,
around

735
00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:57.160
<v 2>30,
35%.
But we do some initiatives,</v>

736
00:43:57.161 --> 00:44:01.540
like for example,
we do,
we do a lot of hackathon at,
at our place.

737
00:44:01.541 --> 00:44:04.660
The first hackathon was only for girls.
And you know,

738
00:44:04.661 --> 00:44:08.500
the winner had dinner with John Dore,
which is like kind of life changing.

739
00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:10.570
And if we look at our portfolio companies,

740
00:44:10.571 --> 00:44:14.770
we have like pretty amazing female founders and you know,

741
00:44:14.771 --> 00:44:18.810
we picked him because they're the best at what they do.
Not because their are,

742
00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:21.760
are really exceptional in what they do.
So we don't wake up in the morning.

743
00:44:21.761 --> 00:44:23.740
So next quarter we only fund men.

744
00:44:23.741 --> 00:44:26.650
And then the recording one [inaudible] just this woman are just really

745
00:44:26.651 --> 00:44:29.000
exceptional and happened to be the founders see you on.

746
00:44:29.001 --> 00:44:30.240
We're very lucky to work with them.

747
00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:33.220
<v 1>Yeah.
It's almost,
it's recharged that we've done.</v>

748
00:44:33.221 --> 00:44:34.720
We didn't reach out for she plus plus,

749
00:44:34.721 --> 00:44:38.260
which is a group at Stanford and uh,

750
00:44:38.261 --> 00:44:40.570
I know it's a great group anyways.

751
00:44:40.571 --> 00:44:45.370
And we hosted like some sort of a design thinking activity for them anyway,

752
00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:49.900
this was maybe two years ago.
But out of that,
um,
we met,
uh,

753
00:44:49.930 --> 00:44:53.380
our current engineering residents who happens to be a woman and she came from

754
00:44:53.381 --> 00:44:56.230
that,
you know,
reach out program that we did.
So that was great.

755
00:44:57.010 --> 00:44:57.440
<v 2>Okay.</v>

756
00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:01.110
<v 4>Um,
so you spoke about founders who have had,</v>

757
00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:04.860
who've lived the problem or have like experiences in some way.

758
00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:07.410
As someone fresh out of college,

759
00:45:07.411 --> 00:45:11.280
I'm interested in solving problems for enterprise because I see that the

760
00:45:11.310 --> 00:45:15.060
software that is much worse than the stuff that we have as consumers,

761
00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:19.170
but obviously like I've only ever worked at very tech forward companies like

762
00:45:19.171 --> 00:45:23.400
Google,
very build our own solutions to all these problems.
Uh,
what are some,

763
00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:27.210
what are some advice you might have for someone like me to either go get that

764
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:30.210
experience by itself with those problems or find people who have

765
00:45:30.650 --> 00:45:35.590
<v 2>I,
I have some,
some ideas with that.
So I think it should educate,
first of all,</v>

766
00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:36.483
I think you'd have to find,

767
00:45:36.490 --> 00:45:39.580
I mean when you say the enterprise is just such a big place,

768
00:45:39.581 --> 00:45:43.660
I think you should figure out where an enterprise you want to focus and get

769
00:45:43.661 --> 00:45:46.210
educated and go to places.
As Martin mentioned,

770
00:45:46.211 --> 00:45:49.930
there's so much information online you can find and there are so many groups you

771
00:45:49.931 --> 00:45:51.490
can go and learn from them.

772
00:45:51.491 --> 00:45:54.340
There are some conferences you can go but a little bit narrow it down.

773
00:45:54.341 --> 00:45:56.990
And exactly what you mean by enterprise and,

774
00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:59.860
and you're surrounded by yourself with the people who have done it before.

775
00:45:59.861 --> 00:46:00.760
Ask questions.

776
00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:05.240
<v 1>Sometimes the best thing is to actually try to put something out.
Right.</v>

777
00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:09.390
And you know,
it's so,
I mean,
I want to say so easy.
You're glad.

778
00:46:09.410 --> 00:46:14.410
It's relatively easy to kind of mock up some stuff and run it by people in

779
00:46:15.591 --> 00:46:20.090
industry.
I Dunno if you have any ideas in mind,
but,

780
00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:23.330
um,
that's what I encourage people to do in the garage when they don't know what

781
00:46:23.331 --> 00:46:25.250
they're doing,
what w what to work on.

782
00:46:25.251 --> 00:46:27.920
We actually bring speakers to tell them what problems they have.

783
00:46:27.921 --> 00:46:28.910
That's how garage started.

784
00:46:28.911 --> 00:46:33.680
So we would bring people from media or people who are real stay or ecommerce and

785
00:46:33.681 --> 00:46:35.270
they would be like,
these are the problems we have.

786
00:46:35.271 --> 00:46:38.630
And the students would actually say work because they would come up with

787
00:46:38.631 --> 00:46:42.530
solutions because similar to you,
that's how it started.
They said,

788
00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:47.300
we can code anything.
We just don't know what to Code.
Um,
and so anyways,

789
00:46:47.301 --> 00:46:50.900
they're getting the feedback from people and I encouraged I Pashman set,

790
00:46:50.901 --> 00:46:53.840
you can do the same but you almost want to take it a step further.

791
00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:55.790
This is when you tell people I'm going to build this.

792
00:46:55.791 --> 00:46:59.270
What do you think people are like,
oh yeah,
great,
great.
And people say like,
wait,

793
00:46:59.271 --> 00:47:01.190
I have product market fit.
I'm going to go do it.

794
00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:06.830
And truly until you tell somebody where you pay me for doing this,
uh,

795
00:47:06.930 --> 00:47:07.521
then you know,

796
00:47:07.521 --> 00:47:11.150
if you have truly product market fit and sometimes people just need to see a

797
00:47:11.151 --> 00:47:15.620
little more than an idea in words or you know,
some sort of PowerPoint,

798
00:47:15.621 --> 00:47:19.820
et cetera.
But I knew it was just stark.
That's my big advice.

799
00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:21.530
That's the best way to finish.

800
00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:25.960
<v 2>One of the questions that we got is what advice do you have for someone at</v>

801
00:47:25.961 --> 00:47:30.190
Google who's interested in going into venture capital?
Talk to pair,

802
00:47:30.270 --> 00:47:31.103
<v 1>right?</v>

803
00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:32.840
<v 2>No,
we are opened.</v>

804
00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:37.840
I actually just hired a person from Stanford business school that she,

805
00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:42.480
she's actually in food,
so she worked for good eggs.

806
00:47:42.481 --> 00:47:47.060
She was a chef before and then a given her expertise and background,

807
00:47:47.090 --> 00:47:49.400
we are creating call for a startup in food.

808
00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:53.690
So if you're interested in any particular way of being a venture capitalists,

809
00:47:53.730 --> 00:47:56.840
it we'd love to talk to you.
And you know when you just,

810
00:47:56.841 --> 00:48:00.640
when you think venture capital award from outside,
it looks like,
you know,

811
00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:04.910
you sit down in a meeting and you look at page and then you provide some

812
00:48:04.911 --> 00:48:08.440
feedback.
It's just one part of being of venture capitalists.

813
00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:09.710
I think I would venture capitalists,

814
00:48:09.711 --> 00:48:13.250
you'd have a really good deal flow I think if you don't have a good deal though,

815
00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:17.960
you ended up picking wrong founders.
So if you're coming out of Google,

816
00:48:17.990 --> 00:48:19.790
you have already a great community here.

817
00:48:19.791 --> 00:48:23.100
That could be a good deal flow and you have to be able to pick winners.

818
00:48:23.170 --> 00:48:24.080
So it takes time.

819
00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:27.710
But just find your niche if you want to be a venture capitalist because it's

820
00:48:27.730 --> 00:48:32.000
saturated market,
but it's always the industry looks for talented people.

821
00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:32.701
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

822
00:48:32.701 --> 00:48:36.000
And I want to say something about that because I think it's the same advice I

823
00:48:36.810 --> 00:48:39.990
gave earlier is just the best ways to start.

824
00:48:39.991 --> 00:48:43.380
And I think we live in a world where you don't have to wait and get permission

825
00:48:43.381 --> 00:48:44.640
to get started.
Right?

826
00:48:44.970 --> 00:48:48.510
So let's assume I want it to get into venture capitalists capital.

827
00:48:48.511 --> 00:48:52.020
Now the first thing I would do is start doing some angel investing,
right?

828
00:48:52.021 --> 00:48:55.110
I think a,
so if you're working at Google as an engineer,

829
00:48:55.111 --> 00:48:59.130
I would guess you can use some percentage of whatever you're making every year

830
00:48:59.190 --> 00:49:01.560
and devoted to do some angel investing,
right?

831
00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:04.420
And just doing a couple of investment.

832
00:49:04.421 --> 00:49:08.040
It's who's going to teach you so much about what it takes,
right?

833
00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:11.670
You're just like passionate and is looks some way,

834
00:49:11.671 --> 00:49:15.990
but once you get in it's kind of dirty and messy and it requires a lot of time,

835
00:49:15.991 --> 00:49:17.040
et cetera.
Um,

836
00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:21.090
the other saying that I think the world it has given us right now,

837
00:49:21.091 --> 00:49:25.170
it was this amazing social media and you know,
the kind of digital access.

838
00:49:25.171 --> 00:49:29.670
So there's a lot of people in the last five to 10 years that has built their own

839
00:49:29.671 --> 00:49:30.960
brand.
Just by,
you know,

840
00:49:30.961 --> 00:49:35.340
I have a podcast and I talk about something or to have a newsletter on AI or

841
00:49:35.341 --> 00:49:36.630
whatever,
you know,

842
00:49:36.690 --> 00:49:40.560
every day there's some new vertical or pitch that people do and they're getting

843
00:49:40.561 --> 00:49:45.450
enough sourcing that they build their own deal flow to get going.
So anyways,

844
00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:49.020
and again,
whoever answered endoring mysterious phase,

845
00:49:49.350 --> 00:49:50.610
happy to chat more with them.

846
00:49:51.090 --> 00:49:54.720
<v 5>Some of the entrepreneurs I respect the most have either lost everything or been</v>

847
00:49:54.721 --> 00:49:56.940
on the verge of losing everything more than one time.

848
00:49:56.941 --> 00:50:00.330
And they're so determined that that's okay.
They just started,

849
00:50:00.331 --> 00:50:01.440
they throw caution to the wind.

850
00:50:01.441 --> 00:50:05.040
Is that something you look for the people that if they didn't have any path to

851
00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:07.620
funding from a group like yours,

852
00:50:07.621 --> 00:50:11.100
that they would just figure out a way and be prepared to put everything at risk

853
00:50:11.101 --> 00:50:15.110
for their idea?
Yeah.

854
00:50:15.130 --> 00:50:19.790
So what do you look for?
Something that is a proxy of,
of this willingness to,

855
00:50:19.791 --> 00:50:23.550
that you'd be willing to go the entrepreneurs that are really,

856
00:50:23.551 --> 00:50:25.970
or they seem that they have gone bankrupt one or more times.

857
00:50:25.971 --> 00:50:28.150
We're on the verge of it.
And I mean,

858
00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:32.450
<v 1>it's not backwards to say that we necessarily looking for,
but,
uh,</v>

859
00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:36.190
uh,
yeah,
I mean,
we do look for that person that is like,
I'm working on this.

860
00:50:36.191 --> 00:50:39.670
Sometimes people come and it's like I'm starting this company,
but you know,

861
00:50:39.671 --> 00:50:41.770
I'm working here in the meantime and,
you know,

862
00:50:41.771 --> 00:50:45.100
they've been working and they could afford,
you know,
to quote quote,

863
00:50:45.101 --> 00:50:49.600
to go do something full time and really commit.
Right?
So it's,
uh,

864
00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:52.270
definitely a sign that we were,
you know,

865
00:50:52.590 --> 00:50:57.190
who doesn't make us feel super cold feet about the founder.
Right.
But again,

866
00:50:57.191 --> 00:50:59.800
everybody's different,
right?
And some people,

867
00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:03.760
it doesn't mean because you have it easy,
you can't be a good founder on it.

868
00:51:03.761 --> 00:51:06.600
Doesn't mean because you'll have it hard.
You're automatic.

869
00:51:06.601 --> 00:51:10.750
Do you have good founder?
Right.
Misled business off exceptions.
That's

870
00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:11.860
<v 3>okay.</v>

871
00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:16.760
<v 6>You know,
one of the hardest things I hear my friends say about at VC is,
um,</v>

872
00:51:17.350 --> 00:51:21.340
the bad ideas look just like the good ideas at first glance.

873
00:51:21.790 --> 00:51:22.930
And when you become good,

874
00:51:22.931 --> 00:51:26.530
you get thousands and thousands of deals coming across and you have to be able

875
00:51:26.531 --> 00:51:30.070
to spot the ones that look back but are really,
really awesome.
Uh,

876
00:51:30.071 --> 00:51:31.300
what are your secrets to doing that?

877
00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:34.250
<v 3>MMM hmm.</v>

878
00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:39.050
<v 2>Okay.
I think is caught of the pattern recognition among the founders.</v>

879
00:51:39.051 --> 00:51:41.530
We typically want to meet founders.

880
00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:45.980
Last year we met 2000 companies.
You've met 2000 companies.

881
00:51:46.010 --> 00:51:49.250
Normally we,
you get about 10,000 beads and so on.

882
00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:51.380
And because we do it so early,

883
00:51:51.381 --> 00:51:55.150
we typically look at the idea where we really want to get to know the,

884
00:51:55.151 --> 00:51:58.910
the founder.
Um,
and in part of it is just pattern recognition.

885
00:51:58.911 --> 00:52:00.530
When you do it for so many years,

886
00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:05.420
you just understand the characters of some of the founders.
But yes,

887
00:52:05.421 --> 00:52:07.580
I mean like in,
in case of branch.

888
00:52:07.610 --> 00:52:12.110
At the first idea was fitbit for dogs.
No.

889
00:52:12.111 --> 00:52:15.620
Say it's the,
I don't,
and I think no one wants to do that,

890
00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:19.400
but it was about the founding team and the character to build something and

891
00:52:19.401 --> 00:52:22.040
their determination to do it.
That attracted us.

892
00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:27.060
<v 1>It's really hard.
I think there's a high error rate,
you know,
adventure.</v>

893
00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:31.710
It looks very glamorous.
We're only known for our successes,
not for our failures.

894
00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:32.160
Right.

895
00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:36.900
So we can invest in companies that don't make it and nobody knows or nobody

896
00:52:36.901 --> 00:52:38.730
cares about the,
you know,

897
00:52:38.731 --> 00:52:42.360
I think it was really important for the founders or we could miss 10 great

898
00:52:42.361 --> 00:52:46.860
companies and it's nowhere to be seen.
Right.
So it's,
um,

899
00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:48.090
you know,
it's,

900
00:52:48.190 --> 00:52:52.530
I mean we have our own internal KPIs to see how we're doing and so on,
but,

901
00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:54.210
um,
you know,

902
00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:58.590
I think we're almost lucky that we're not measured externally on those misses.

903
00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:02.310
But it's hard truth.
It's hard on everybody misses.
Right.

904
00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:06.690
And I seeing on there like hard work and obsession.
Yeah.
You know,

905
00:53:06.691 --> 00:53:08.700
gets you to be better at data of the day.

906
00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:13.170
<v 2>Do you have any notable misses that you can talk about?</v>

907
00:53:14.070 --> 00:53:18.120
<v 1>Yes,
we do.
Uh,
you know,</v>

908
00:53:18.121 --> 00:53:22.200
it's early in the fund because,
so we may have missed more than I know of a,

909
00:53:22.201 --> 00:53:24.870
I think we miss boxed witches up giant company.

910
00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:28.410
It's like a Costco online.
And you know,

911
00:53:28.411 --> 00:53:32.560
I think again,
if we had stuck by our principals,

912
00:53:32.561 --> 00:53:35.400
sometimes it's like missing our principles.
It's really hard.

913
00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:39.690
You say great founders,
uh,
something doesn't make sense,
but it's okay.

914
00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:42.150
Uh,
you know,
and at the time it's like,
wow,

915
00:53:42.210 --> 00:53:45.770
are they competing with Amazon who wants to compete with Amazon?
Um,

916
00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:50.280
and it was a little later stage,
but you know,
we missed that company for example.

917
00:53:50.330 --> 00:53:51.163
You know?

918
00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:53.880
<v 7>So what kind of advice do you give to the founders,</v>

919
00:53:53.890 --> 00:53:55.900
whether they're looking for new founders over there,

920
00:53:55.950 --> 00:54:00.030
they're looking to break like first three or four people on the team.

921
00:54:00.031 --> 00:54:04.260
What kind of characteristics or what advice you give them as they expand and

922
00:54:04.261 --> 00:54:05.550
bringing new people in the team?

923
00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:09.710
<v 1>It's a good question and I think,
okay.
In general.</v>

924
00:54:09.711 --> 00:54:11.840
So I think there's two types of recruiting.

925
00:54:11.841 --> 00:54:14.630
One is like your founding team and then,
you know,

926
00:54:14.631 --> 00:54:17.720
obviously a lot of plies later to the next 10.

927
00:54:17.810 --> 00:54:22.340
The first time people are the first 100 et cetera.
But,
um,
you know,
when you are,

928
00:54:22.370 --> 00:54:25.700
if you're building that founding team,
I have this,

929
00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:27.950
the most important advice.

930
00:54:27.951 --> 00:54:31.780
Just take your time and actually be super focused.

931
00:54:31.781 --> 00:54:33.350
That doing it takes time,
right?

932
00:54:33.351 --> 00:54:37.100
It doesn't just happen by itself that all of a sudden you find you're founder

933
00:54:37.101 --> 00:54:38.120
and he's a perfect thing.

934
00:54:38.121 --> 00:54:41.840
It's because you're out there and you're trying to find this person,
right?

935
00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:46.280
And you can't just hire the first person that comes along or bring our,

936
00:54:46.281 --> 00:54:48.950
get together with the first person that comes along a,

937
00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:52.730
because it's like finding a wife,
right?
For,
you know,

938
00:54:52.731 --> 00:54:56.300
when you could marry your first girlfriend,
but maybe it was a bad idea.

939
00:54:56.300 --> 00:55:00.560
Your first girlfriend was at 14.
I don't know.
Uh,
it's the same thing,
right?

940
00:55:00.561 --> 00:55:04.700
So you have to be super patient,
uh,
at making the right choice.

941
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.150
That second thing is,
I think it's good to find people that are complimentary,

942
00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:11.750
especially if you're starting from zero.
Um,
there's the,
you know,

943
00:55:11.751 --> 00:55:16.070
if you want to pull out a company together,
you maybe need somebody.
Um,

944
00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:18.690
you know,
that has it as an engineer,

945
00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:21.860
front end engineer and a data scientist,

946
00:55:21.861 --> 00:55:26.480
maybe on some person that's more than operations,
our sales or something,

947
00:55:26.540 --> 00:55:30.170
right?
Sometimes it's one person that can do the three things,
right?

948
00:55:30.171 --> 00:55:33.860
Because you have a founder that is excellent at speaking to customers and

949
00:55:33.861 --> 00:55:36.740
they've built everything and so on and they can just pull it out.

950
00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:40.400
But sometimes you need two people,
sometimes you need three people.
Right?

951
00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:44.600
And I think,
you know,
it's important to have the,
for me,
I think it's important.

952
00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:49.310
I see it in companies when the critical components of the company I in the DNA

953
00:55:49.311 --> 00:55:53.510
of that company from very,
very early on,
you'll have a higher chance of success.

954
00:55:54.020 --> 00:55:55.520
Um,
not always the case,

955
00:55:55.521 --> 00:56:00.500
but for another good example is if you're building a consumer brand,
you know,

956
00:56:00.501 --> 00:56:02.240
some companies will say,
oh,
we're,

957
00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:05.420
we have this great product and we'll hire a branding agency later,
right?

958
00:56:05.421 --> 00:56:07.280
But if you are like a consumer companies,

959
00:56:07.310 --> 00:56:10.700
good to have a consumer DNA early in the company for example,

960
00:56:10.701 --> 00:56:15.230
and you should go find that person is like,
I call it the minimum viable team,

961
00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:19.700
sort of the minimal viable product.
You know,
I want to add that um,

962
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:24.160
a lot of people can build product.
Not many

963
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:27.730
<v 2>people can build companies.
So if you are looking for the co founder,</v>

964
00:56:27.731 --> 00:56:31.150
look for those people who have as more mentioned complimentary skills,

965
00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:34.750
but it can help you both companies if you're looking for a VP of engineering as

966
00:56:34.751 --> 00:56:39.130
a co founder is not enough to just be a great engineer.
As you build the product,

967
00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:43.570
you just need to be able to attract talents.
So just spend a lot of family.

968
00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:45.310
I learned that,
you know,

969
00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:49.180
spend time socially tells a lot about crypto club person.

970
00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:53.290
So get them out there,
go for a walk and just go see a ball game.

971
00:56:53.330 --> 00:56:58.240
Just get to know them and just be patient and then making sure they have you

972
00:56:58.241 --> 00:56:59.930
shared the same vision.
You know,
the,

973
00:56:59.970 --> 00:57:04.750
the most difficult thing as an early stage investor is when founders can,

974
00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:07.060
cannot get along.
You always can raise money,

975
00:57:07.061 --> 00:57:09.670
you can always change the product and pivot.

976
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:14.710
But when you don't have the same vision and you can look eye to eye,

977
00:57:14.770 --> 00:57:15.880
we can't fix it.

978
00:57:17.310 --> 00:57:20.760
<v 8>So a question for you all,
or when should someone go to YC?</v>

979
00:57:21.210 --> 00:57:25.830
It only because it's got so much mind shot here versus taking VC from CDC,

980
00:57:25.950 --> 00:57:29.580
from a VC firm like yourself.
So that's the first question.

981
00:57:29.581 --> 00:57:32.880
Or the second one is how do you differentiate yourself among other vcs?

982
00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:36.510
Because you know,
for all of us here who live and breathe technology,

983
00:57:36.511 --> 00:57:41.511
we hear of so many vcs all the time is 16 z has a very strong machine marketing

984
00:57:42.271 --> 00:57:43.020
machine.

985
00:57:43.020 --> 00:57:46.650
So how do you sort of a benchmark yourself against them to sort of stand out?

986
00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:49.130
<v 2>Um,</v>

987
00:57:49.130 --> 00:57:54.020
I think today they're pretty amazing accelerator out there including YC and they

988
00:57:54.021 --> 00:57:57.830
have done a really good job last,
you know,
five to 10 years to hurry,

989
00:57:57.910 --> 00:58:01.670
help founders from ground zero to get to the next stage.

990
00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:06.650
And it all depends on your knee.
And what you can accomplish there.
Um,

991
00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:11.480
there are other resources that you can use and not go through an accelerator.

992
00:58:11.481 --> 00:58:14.980
But again,
I think it's case by case is very different.
Yes,

993
00:58:14.990 --> 00:58:18.920
the venture capital community is just very crowded.
But again,

994
00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:21.310
if you're looking for um,

995
00:58:21.830 --> 00:58:26.180
people who can help you the first 24 months and help you build the foundation of

996
00:58:26.181 --> 00:58:27.350
a long lasting company,

997
00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:31.980
you need to look for venture capitalists who have that experience.
Um,

998
00:58:32.090 --> 00:58:37.090
I think that their firm is set up to serve you in that and they take the risk

999
00:58:38.001 --> 00:58:41.480
and they're able to,
to navigate the challenges that you have.

1000
00:58:41.810 --> 00:58:45.260
There are other vcs that you only go to them when you have product market fit

1001
00:58:45.261 --> 00:58:48.680
the of the customer and it can scale and you want to build an engineering team.

1002
00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:51.500
That's a different skillset.
We don't have that skill set.

1003
00:58:51.530 --> 00:58:55.190
Our DNA of our fund is helping founders in the ground zero,

1004
00:58:55.191 --> 00:58:59.690
especially in the first 24 months.
So that's where we set up.
But you know,

1005
00:58:59.710 --> 00:59:01.400
sequoia might be completed their friends,

1006
00:59:01.730 --> 00:59:04.760
you can go to them when you have customers and they can help you to become a

1007
00:59:04.761 --> 00:59:05.594
massive company.

1008
00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:09.770
Maybe a lot to say something that I think it's really important for founders.

1009
00:59:09.771 --> 00:59:14.730
There is multiple ways to get to build a deck company,
right?

1010
00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:15.760
Um,

1011
00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:20.270
there's no one single place you need to go to be successful at the end of the

1012
00:59:20.271 --> 00:59:22.100
company's work because of us.

1013
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:26.960
<v 1>But because of the founders and we're like really like support and we try very,</v>

1014
00:59:26.961 --> 00:59:28.370
very hard to support them.

1015
00:59:28.430 --> 00:59:32.480
But at the end is really the founder that makes or breaks the company,
not us.

1016
00:59:33.110 --> 00:59:34.990
I hope.
I hope none of us anyways.

1017
00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:39.620
<v 5>How would you guys,
or what sort of characterize is,
uh,</v>

1018
00:59:39.690 --> 00:59:41.560
when you see someone who has been at Google for awhile,

1019
00:59:41.670 --> 00:59:43.890
like sort of like what are their characteristics?

1020
00:59:43.891 --> 00:59:45.880
He sort of in your mind picture when you,

1021
00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:48.750
when you see someone like that and then maybe particularly for product

1022
00:59:48.751 --> 00:59:52.510
management.
Um,
another way of asking is like,
what kinds of things should we like,

1023
00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:54.270
make sure we learn while we're here?

1024
00:59:56.280 --> 01:00:00.120
<v 1>Good question.
Um,
well first of all,</v>

1025
01:00:00.121 --> 01:00:03.710
maybe I will say some people who are passionate and says something smarter.
Um,

1026
01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:07.950
we love the PM role as a CEO for a company.

1027
01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:10.650
We think it's just like an amazing,
you know,

1028
01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:14.730
cause when you're a pm you're like a mini CEO,
right?

1029
01:00:15.110 --> 01:00:17.520
And when you're a CEO,
just have more responsibility because there's,

1030
01:00:17.521 --> 01:00:21.990
this is more,
you know,
I mean there's just,
you're on the edge all the time,

1031
01:00:22.350 --> 01:00:25.950
but it's a great experience.
And I think the more broad it is,
right?

1032
01:00:25.951 --> 01:00:30.480
Like all the way from customer to talking to the engineer,
um,

1033
01:00:30.690 --> 01:00:33.240
the better writer,
the more exposure,
the more projects,

1034
01:00:33.290 --> 01:00:36.720
etc. And seeing things from mental end,
right?
Because it's different.

1035
01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:39.270
Taking a project from zero to 80%,

1036
01:00:39.271 --> 01:00:43.410
then from 80% to 100% and getting it out there and following up.

1037
01:00:43.411 --> 01:00:46.230
What happens when you put it out and customers are using it,

1038
01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:49.680
etc. I don't know exactly how the PM thing is.

1039
01:00:49.681 --> 01:00:52.260
Work is organized here at Google.
I apologize,

1040
01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:56.100
but I know every company is slightly different,
but just all the way.

1041
01:00:56.370 --> 01:01:00.180
And I think broad,
that would be my,
my advice to you,

1042
01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:04.950
<v 2>and it all depends if you're planning to start a company,</v>

1043
01:01:04.951 --> 01:01:07.730
I think it depends on you.
You have to build your network year.

1044
01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:10.240
It's an amazing place.
You build a network.
Um,

1045
01:01:10.650 --> 01:01:13.830
I met the CEO who has building a great company.

1046
01:01:13.831 --> 01:01:17.310
We actually missed being an investor in that company and he was a pm of a large

1047
01:01:17.311 --> 01:01:21.480
company and he was telling me for four years it was pm every time he shipped the

1048
01:01:21.481 --> 01:01:22.314
product,

1049
01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:26.460
he then went to a smaller team and start from ground zero because he knew he was

1050
01:01:26.461 --> 01:01:30.840
to start a company.
So he was always uncomfortable being in a big team.

1051
01:01:31.050 --> 01:01:35.040
So he always requested the CTO,
CEO,
I manage to ship this product.

1052
01:01:35.041 --> 01:01:38.250
I just want to go start again from ground zero bill,
just give me more,

1053
01:01:38.251 --> 01:01:42.630
more tasks that I can do it and it,
speaking of that,
I have a request here.

1054
01:01:42.810 --> 01:01:43.561
As mark mentioned,

1055
01:01:43.561 --> 01:01:48.490
we think pms are companies are the best founders cov have seen because they're

1056
01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:53.540
their own CEO and if you're trying to build them a conference or a bootcamp

1057
01:01:54.011 --> 01:01:58.930
camp,
maybe this year or next year for PM's who want to start a company already

1058
01:01:58.980 --> 01:01:59.813
started it.

1059
01:01:59.910 --> 01:02:04.470
So we love to hear from you what type of topics you want to be covered so you

1060
01:02:04.471 --> 01:02:06.870
can email me page mount pair that we see.

1061
01:02:06.871 --> 01:02:09.390
I love to hear from you because you think it's just pretty,

1062
01:02:09.450 --> 01:02:13.350
pretty amazing place for us to partner with the future founders.

1063
01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:15.033
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1064
01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:18.970
<v 5>Uh,
you mentioned like reaching out and getting help from people.</v>

1065
01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:20.010
That's always something I've

1066
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:21.810
<v 2>been nervous about.
Uh,</v>

1067
01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:26.640
when asking for help from someone like yourselves who are busy individuals,

1068
01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:28.860
do you have advice for how to ask for help?

1069
01:02:28.861 --> 01:02:32.610
Like should I go when it's a well formed clearly scope,

1070
01:02:32.611 --> 01:02:36.060
like 32nd question.
Do you have,

1071
01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:40.890
are are people like yourselves interested in having kind of open ended kind of

1072
01:02:40.891 --> 01:02:44.550
broader discussions as well?
You know,
I always found the people reach out to me.

1073
01:02:44.551 --> 01:02:48.960
They're very,
very specific.
I respond,
I always respond.

1074
01:02:48.990 --> 01:02:53.370
But the ones that are very specific,
I make time.
But the ones that say sell,

1075
01:02:53.371 --> 01:02:57.690
can I have a coffee?
I want to run an idea by you.
It just not that specific.

1076
01:02:57.691 --> 01:03:02.400
I don't know how I can help with an accurate,
just so busy.
So just be very,

1077
01:03:02.401 --> 01:03:06.480
very specific and park it to people who can really help you and even passionate

1078
01:03:06.481 --> 01:03:08.400
about the topic you want to discuss with them.

1079
01:03:09.010 --> 01:03:12.260
<v 1>I think,
you know,
I meet more people,
I'm like lower bit,</v>

1080
01:03:12.261 --> 01:03:14.170
lower a bar I would say.

1081
01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:18.230
But I think for me when people tell me their story again like hey,

1082
01:03:18.530 --> 01:03:22.190
I'm a Google or I've been working on this for a long time and I'm thinking of

1083
01:03:22.191 --> 01:03:23.960
doing this,
do you want to have a chat with me?

1084
01:03:24.410 --> 01:03:27.610
And if I have time I definitely will do it.
You know?
So,
but again,

1085
01:03:27.650 --> 01:03:31.490
sell yourself if you don't have a company to sell,
sell yourself.

1086
01:03:31.690 --> 01:03:34.810
<v 2>Yeah,
and actually this goes back to when you go fundraise.</v>

1087
01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:38.690
I think sometimes if you tell your story is as important as your product and

1088
01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:39.760
metrics.
And,

1089
01:03:40.130 --> 01:03:45.130
and most of the founders I'm shy away to say that to tell their stories be they

1090
01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:50.800
actually pushed them.
They start to say,
oh,
where did you grow up?

1091
01:03:50.830 --> 01:03:54.670
How did you do?
And so we just want to get to know them.
So when you go pitch,

1092
01:03:54.671 --> 01:03:57.100
don't,
don't be shy way to tell your stories.

1093
01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:01.350
<v 5>What was the hardest part for start?
I,
after you've started VC,</v>

1094
01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:03.160
what was your hardest thing that you know,

1095
01:04:03.590 --> 01:04:06.030
took to get used to like where did you struggle?

1096
01:04:06.031 --> 01:04:10.280
Lowers some common pitfalls early on you had mentioned,
uh,
like trying to create,

1097
01:04:10.281 --> 01:04:13.730
you know,
like a linear regression,
all these parameters,

1098
01:04:13.731 --> 01:04:17.090
trying to optimize and trying to bring in from time to next optimization here.

1099
01:04:17.450 --> 01:04:19.310
Um,
other,
other things that you struggled with?

1100
01:04:20.410 --> 01:04:24.560
<v 2>You know,
I think today even to look at this is like three and a half years.</v>

1101
01:04:24.561 --> 01:04:26.450
Finally you have like over

1102
01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:30.470
60 companies that we have invested.

1103
01:04:30.471 --> 01:04:35.471
So finding the time to help these people while we still serve the community.

1104
01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:37.280
It's a big challenge for us are,

1105
01:04:37.390 --> 01:04:40.220
that's why we building a team as an angel investor.

1106
01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:43.430
So before that I was an Indian investor.
When you're doing an angel investment,

1107
01:04:43.810 --> 01:04:45.920
you just keep investing,
just invest.

1108
01:04:45.921 --> 01:04:49.640
And every new company you invest very excited to go to next one and you are

1109
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:52.940
managing get fun.
You want to invest in 30 40 companies.

1110
01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:57.380
So you have to have a discipline to the concentrated portfolio.

1111
01:04:57.690 --> 01:05:01.670
That's a big difference.
Um,
every company we invest today,

1112
01:05:01.671 --> 01:05:05.360
that means more or less company and next three years.
So,

1113
01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:07.580
but even when you're an angel investor and you never think about it,

1114
01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:08.660
you just keep investing.

1115
01:05:09.690 --> 01:05:12.990
<v 1>I think for me the hardest thing was like,
imagine you're,
you know,</v>

1116
01:05:12.991 --> 01:05:16.500
you're being an operator all your life and all of a sudden you were an investor.

1117
01:05:16.930 --> 01:05:19.210
So I think for the first year I'm like,
you know,

1118
01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:22.390
we didn't have that many companies.
When you start,
you don't have any companies,

1119
01:05:22.391 --> 01:05:27.220
right?
So passion knows the story.
But I remember,

1120
01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:27.610
you know,

1121
01:05:27.610 --> 01:05:30.900
one Sunday I was there and I was like writing code for one of the companies.

1122
01:05:30.901 --> 01:05:35.350
So like,
okay,
that's not right.
Uh,
so,
but that's your,
you know,

1123
01:05:35.351 --> 01:05:39.730
there's a lot of inertia and what we do as humans.
So,
uh,
you know,
I,

1124
01:05:39.731 --> 01:05:43.660
I not longer doing that,
but so that was my hardest adjustment,

1125
01:05:43.690 --> 01:05:47.410
knowing that I can't do it.
My job is to teach somebody how to do it all,

1126
01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:50.110
suggest how to do it.
They have to make the decisions,

1127
01:05:50.111 --> 01:05:53.770
but I shouldn't do it every several years.
There are new,

1128
01:05:53.820 --> 01:05:55.230
big trends in the industry,

1129
01:05:55.590 --> 01:05:58.500
so there are a lot of things that are very hot right now,

1130
01:05:58.530 --> 01:06:02.960
like a self driving car,
VR,
ar,
AI and sexual.

1131
01:06:03.210 --> 01:06:07.120
So like,
uh,
how do you evaluate those fields at sexual?

1132
01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:11.280
Like how do you think about those trends right now and then what would be big

1133
01:06:11.610 --> 01:06:14.550
things that can change the world has changed the industry in the several,

1134
01:06:14.610 --> 01:06:18.900
in the next like five or 10 years.
Every year,
right?
Every 10 years.

1135
01:06:18.901 --> 01:06:22.380
There's like this big change that has happened in the valley.
Right.

1136
01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:27.840
And I liked to tell the story,
but in 76,
it was the PC,
right?
10 years later,

1137
01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:32.900
they 86 and it was maybe the router and then you later in [inaudible] 96 so it

1138
01:06:33.571 --> 01:06:37.890
was the internet.
10 years later,
you know,
six was the iPhone.
So people are like,

1139
01:06:37.891 --> 01:06:41.100
what's happened now in 2016 has already passed.
Right?

1140
01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:46.520
And I tell people it's probably an Nvidia Gpu processor that's probably the neck

1141
01:06:46.620 --> 01:06:51.180
is like a Nicole and off that router.
Um,
and a lot of things,
the fact that we're,

1142
01:06:51.210 --> 01:06:55.800
you know,
when I was doing my phd,
we,
you know,
I was doing convex optimization,

1143
01:06:55.801 --> 01:06:59.970
which almost the anti deep learning way of doing,
solving a problem,

1144
01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:03.500
um,
and the deep learning people at Stanford,

1145
01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:06.750
they couldn't even run a little 20 circuit,
you know,

1146
01:07:07.110 --> 01:07:11.910
amplify or they can size it,
right?
And,
you know,
fast forward 17 years,

1147
01:07:11.911 --> 01:07:14.190
you can do amazing things with deep learning.

1148
01:07:14.191 --> 01:07:18.630
So it this platforms that take place like the iPhone or the Internet,

1149
01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:21.800
it's not something that just changes,
uh,
you know,

1150
01:07:21.801 --> 01:07:25.390
a particular behavioral changes,
industries,
inches,
you know,
um,

1151
01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:29.340
the enterprise a change as media.
I changed as a consumer.
It changes everything,

1152
01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:33.000
right?
Uh,
in the case of that Nvidia Gpu,

1153
01:07:33.001 --> 01:07:35.520
I think the same is going to happen.
We're at the very,

1154
01:07:35.521 --> 01:07:38.550
very beginning and a lot of technology cycles,

1155
01:07:38.850 --> 01:07:42.480
they're like second or their systems,
they overshoot and then they go back,
right?

1156
01:07:42.481 --> 01:07:45.560
So the internet,
everybody was like overpriced and then it kind start off.

1157
01:07:45.630 --> 01:07:48.720
Same with mobile apps,
with everything.
Um,

1158
01:07:49.410 --> 01:07:54.030
so now we're in the cycle where everybody's super excited about AI and or VR and

1159
01:07:54.031 --> 01:07:54.990
ar.
Even VR.

1160
01:07:54.991 --> 01:07:59.370
Ar I think is a steal even still a little early on the investment cycle.
Um,

1161
01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:01.200
but you know,
you,

1162
01:08:01.350 --> 01:08:05.610
you have to do your homework as an investor if in our job,
right,

1163
01:08:06.090 --> 01:08:09.870
when you say AI,
not all AI was created equal,
I think,
right?

1164
01:08:09.871 --> 01:08:13.020
For some cases you absolutely need to be 100% accurate.

1165
01:08:13.021 --> 01:08:17.600
For some cases it's okay if you're 80% and you can build a product around it,

1166
01:08:17.750 --> 01:08:20.180
maybe we won't be 100% for another five years.

1167
01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:24.350
I'm telling and those are the sort of little things that we are evaluated.

1168
01:08:24.830 --> 01:08:29.690
But again at the end we're thinking it all goes back to the founders,

1169
01:08:29.691 --> 01:08:31.250
the founder,
you know,

1170
01:08:31.251 --> 01:08:35.030
aware of where they are and where he is and the limitations of what they have

1171
01:08:35.031 --> 01:08:37.040
and so on.
Anyways,
you know,

1172
01:08:37.050 --> 01:08:40.940
I suffer more Livey followed.
I mean we,

1173
01:08:40.941 --> 01:08:44.840
we are aware of trends where we don't follow trends and if you think when it's

1174
01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:47.690
hot,
it's already too late to invest.

1175
01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:52.720
I think you want to partner with founders who see future before anybody else and

1176
01:08:53.241 --> 01:08:56.780
you partner with them.
And if you look at the best companies ever created,

1177
01:08:56.781 --> 01:09:00.890
the Renard in any hot space is look stock market and it's too hard.

1178
01:09:00.891 --> 01:09:02.000
It's too late to buy.

1179
01:09:02.450 --> 01:09:06.110
You want to make sure you buy those stocks at the time that not many people
know.

1180
01:09:06.530 --> 01:09:09.080
And you know,
for us he's just really,

1181
01:09:09.530 --> 01:09:13.160
rather than looking for what is hot,
we look for outliers.

1182
01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:17.720
For those founders who are determined to build something really massive in the

1183
01:09:17.721 --> 01:09:21.470
market,
that they believe it exists and we can help them.
And you know,

1184
01:09:21.471 --> 01:09:24.950
in this cycles,
it really is like at this overshoot,
you know,

1185
01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:30.070
the best companies almost get funded four to five years after people start

1186
01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:33.230
realizing,
you know,
the big change.
You know,
it's like,
um,
you know,

1187
01:09:33.231 --> 01:09:37.970
even when Google was founded,
it was not,
it was not at Yahoo.

1188
01:09:38.030 --> 01:09:42.290
Right.
It was a little later or Uber and he's a little later after the iPhone,

1189
01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:46.370
you know,
it wasn't,
it's like radical change.
Maybe it takes a little bit of time.

1190
01:09:47.650 --> 01:09:50.250
All right,
well thank you.
Are Out of time,
but it was really great.

1191
01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:53.000
Thank you for him.
Thank you.
Oh,
good question.
Yeah.

1192
01:09:53.090 --> 01:09:57.310
