Cody,
you soul Vegas,
change the company.

12
00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:46.710
He cofounded dual Microsoft for $265 billion.

13
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.520
Do you think joints oppose as an advisor and investor and eventually be,

14
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.370
can see,
oh,

15
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.060
where he helped salvos grow from almost no sales to over $1 billion in annual

16
00:01:00.271 --> 00:01:02.130
sales.
Wow.

17
00:01:02.131 --> 00:01:07.131

Tony is a huge inspiration for me.

21
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.530
One of my goals in life is to create happiness in the workplace by doing it from

22
00:01:25.531 --> 00:01:29.370
bottom up.
Buck,
while Tony does it from top down.

23
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.430
S C o n he does is systematically and he does it in a way that is very

24
00:01:35.551 --> 00:01:40.290
profitable for his company.
He's an example.

25
00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:45.090
He's deeply inspiring for me and I hope that you will become a model or odyssey

26
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.110
or see the world and with debt.
Please welcome.
Do you see

27
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.740
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

28
00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.380
<v 2>so everyone can hear me.
Okay.
Uh,
want to take a quick survey first.</v>

29
00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.760
How many of you have actually purchased from Zappos did before?
Oh Wow.

30
00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.280
I didn't know.
So normally when I do this survey,

31
00:02:09.281 --> 00:02:12.580
the ratio is about two to one women to men.

32
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.120
And a lot of guys that I asked say they themselves personally haven't,

33
00:02:16.121 --> 00:02:19.600
but there are some youth,
another or a wife has in.

34
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.870
So I was actually giving a tour of our headquarters in Las Vegas and we actually

35
00:02:25.541 --> 00:02:28.740
give tours to the public.
So next time any of you are in Las Vegas,
uh,

36
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.050
we'll pick you up in his Zappos shuttle from the airport,
give you a tour.

37
00:02:32.051 --> 00:02:36.460
And then drop you off at your hotel afterwards.
It's a lot of fun.
And uh,

38
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.060
I'll give the information later on on how to get it to her.
But anyways,

39
00:02:40.061 --> 00:02:44.830
I was giving a tour to an executive from one of the major record labels and I

40
00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:47.860
asked him the exact same question and he said,
no,

41
00:02:47.861 --> 00:02:50.440
he personally hasn't shopped from Zappos,

42
00:02:50.441 --> 00:02:54.430
but he suspects his wife has because these white boxes would show up at his

43
00:02:54.431 --> 00:02:56.110
doorstep and then they disappear.

44
00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.760
And he wasn't sure if she was returning them or them or what was going on.

45
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.320
And every time he asked her,

46
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:06.220
she refused to answer what was the answer him and tell him what was going on.

47
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.330
So anyways,
we went through the ground floor of our office and that's where our

48
00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:14.530
merchandising team is.
And then we went upstairs to our customer loyalty team,

49
00:03:14.531 --> 00:03:18.080
which is our name for our call center.
And,

50
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.840
and he sat down next to one of our call center reps and forced her to pull up

51
00:03:22.841 --> 00:03:23.830
his wife's account.

52
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.570
And he discovered that she had spent over $62,000 in lifetime.

53
00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:32.980
So,
yeah,

54
00:03:32.981 --> 00:03:37.600
hopefully we weren't instrumental in any divorce proceedings or so before

55
00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:41.950
getting into the Zappos wanted to talk a little bit about what led me to Zappos.

56
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.050
And the story actually begins with the pizza in college.

57
00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:49.630
I was running a pizza business with my roommate.

58
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.320
We were probably had three or 400 students in our dorm.

59
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.520
We were on the ground floor and we were responsible for investing in the ovens.

60
00:03:57.521 --> 00:03:59.410
And we hired the workers,
set the menus,

61
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.160
and occasionally I was making the pizzas myself as well.

62
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.590
And this guy named Alfred,

63
00:04:05.591 --> 00:04:09.820
who's now our CFO and COO at Zappos,
this is actually how we met,

64
00:04:09.821 --> 00:04:10.750
was over pizza.

65
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.890
He would stop by every night in order this large pepperoni pizza for me.

66
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.600
And for me,
it wasn't actually that weird cause he,

67
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.160
I remember late nights we,

68
00:04:21.161 --> 00:04:24.880
there'd be 10 of us at a Chinese restaurant somewhere and he would literally

69
00:04:24.881 --> 00:04:27.400
finish everyone's leftovers.
And we had nicknames for,

70
00:04:27.401 --> 00:04:31.690
I'm like human trash compactor or monster.
And so,

71
00:04:31.691 --> 00:04:36.010
but then sometimes he would stop by a few hours later in order another large

72
00:04:36.011 --> 00:04:38.740
pepperoni pizza for me.
And I was just thinking,
wow,

73
00:04:38.741 --> 00:04:41.500
this boy can really eat well.

74
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.500
I found out several years later he was taking the pizzas upstairs and selling

75
00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:47.920
them off by the slice.

76
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.750
So that's why he's our CFO and COO today.

77
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.870
Zappos.
So after the pizza business,

78
00:04:55.871 --> 00:04:58.900
the same roommate I was running it with in the Sonjay,

79
00:04:58.901 --> 00:05:01.990
he and I got together and formed a company called link exchange.

80
00:05:01.991 --> 00:05:04.990
This was back in 1996 during the early.com days.

81
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.590
And we grew that company to about a hundred people and then ended up selling the

82
00:05:08.591 --> 00:05:13.591
company to Microsoft in 1998 but what a lot of people don't know is the reason

83
00:05:14.831 --> 00:05:16.570
why we ended up selling the company.

84
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.860
And it's because the company culture just went completely downhill.

85
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.590
And I remember when it was just five or 10 of us,

86
00:05:23.591 --> 00:05:27.430
it was kind of like your typical.com back in the day we were working around the

87
00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:30.790
clock,
sleeping under our desks,
had no idea what day of the week it was,

88
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.870
trying to remember to shower every few days.
And,
but it was a lot of fun.

89
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.550
And as we were growing,

90
00:05:36.551 --> 00:05:41.350
we had friends that were on trips across the country on vacation and they would

91
00:05:41.351 --> 00:05:45.370
stop by and hang out for a day or two and then we'd hire them and they never

92
00:05:45.371 --> 00:05:50.050
made their way back home.
And that got us to about 15 or 20 people.

93
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.320
And then when we got to 20 people,
it was still a lot of fun.

94
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.540
But we ran out of friends.

95
00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:00.870
And so we started hiring people that had all the right skill sets and

96
00:06:01.071 --> 00:06:04.250
experiences,
but they weren't necessarily good for the culture.

97
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.240
And there wasn't any one hire that made the culture go downhill.

98
00:06:08.241 --> 00:06:11.300
But just slowly over time,
by the time we got to a hundred people,

99
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.380
I myself dreaded getting out of the bed in the morning to go to the office.

100
00:06:15.381 --> 00:06:19.220
And that was kind of a weird feeling because this was a company that I had co

101
00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:23.800
founded and felt like I had lost control of the culture.
And if I felt that way,

102
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.880
wondered how all the other employees felt.

103
00:06:25.881 --> 00:06:29.060
So that's really what drove us to sell the company to Microsoft.

104
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.200
And after selling the company Alpha and I got together and we formed an

105
00:06:33.201 --> 00:06:36.830
investment fund and we invest in in probably about 20 or so different internet

106
00:06:36.831 --> 00:06:39.590
companies and zap what's just happened to be one of them.

107
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.960
But over the course of a year I realized that for me investing was really
boring.

108
00:06:44.961 --> 00:06:49.340
I felt like I was sitting on the sidelines and not really involved in and I

109
00:06:49.341 --> 00:06:51.560
really miss being part of building something.

110
00:06:51.561 --> 00:06:56.561
And so within a year I joined Zappos full time and I've been with Zappos ever

111
00:06:56.661 --> 00:06:58.820
since.
I'm sure many of you have heard.

112
00:06:58.821 --> 00:07:03.140
Last July Amazon announced they were acquiring Zappos in that deal officially

113
00:07:03.141 --> 00:07:04.160
closed in November.

114
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:08.450
But actually it's very different from most deals that Amazon has done in most of

115
00:07:08.451 --> 00:07:09.260
their deals.

116
00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:13.460
The plan is to acquire the company and then integrated into Amazon for this as a

117
00:07:13.461 --> 00:07:17.580
precondition condition for even talking about the scenario,
uh,

118
00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:21.410
we told them we wanted to remain independent and continue to grow this apolis

119
00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:24.890
brand and our culture and our way of doing business our way.

120
00:07:24.891 --> 00:07:28.010
And so they've actually,
they've stayed true to their word.

121
00:07:28.011 --> 00:07:29.540
So we're pretty happy with that.

122
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:32.900
And basically instead of flying once a quarter to the bay area for board

123
00:07:32.901 --> 00:07:35.900
meetings,
we now fly once a quarter to Seattle.

124
00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.740
So most people when they hear about Zappos,

125
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.210
think of us as an online retailer of shoes because that's how we started.

126
00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.430
But internally we have a saying,

127
00:07:46.431 --> 00:07:50.630
we say that we're a service company that just happens to sell shoes and we

128
00:07:50.631 --> 00:07:53.710
actually sell a lot more than shoes now.
We sell clothing,
uh,

129
00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.890
even beauty products,
kitchen ware house,

130
00:07:55.891 --> 00:07:59.720
where in our whole goal is that we're hoping 10 years from now people won't even

131
00:07:59.721 --> 00:08:00.260
realize.

132
00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:04.010
We started out selling shoes online and we really just want to build our brand

133
00:08:04.011 --> 00:08:06.560
to be about the very best customer service.

134
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:11.890
And we've grown from basically no sales in 1999 two in 2008 was the first time

135
00:08:12.231 --> 00:08:15.920
we hit $1 billion in gross merchandise sales and we're continuing to grow,

136
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.500
continuing to grow in Q one of this year,

137
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:22.490
our net sales were up almost 50% year over year the previous year.

138
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:26.450
And the number one driver of all that growth has been through repeat customers

139
00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:27.403
and word of mouth.

140
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:31.040
So our whole philosophy is let's take most of the money we would've spent on

141
00:08:31.041 --> 00:08:34.850
paid advertising and paid marketing and instead invest in new the customer

142
00:08:34.851 --> 00:08:39.650
experience and let our customers do the marketing for us.
And we've,

143
00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:42.080
you know,
we're thinking 20 or 30 years from now,

144
00:08:42.081 --> 00:08:46.100
we've even had customers email us and ask us if we would please run an airline

145
00:08:46.101 --> 00:08:48.860
or the IRS.
And you know,

146
00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:52.670
we're not going to do either of those things this year,
but you know,

147
00:08:52.671 --> 00:08:53.930
20 or 30 years from now,

148
00:08:53.931 --> 00:08:58.170
I wouldn't rule out a airlines that's just about the very best customer service

149
00:08:58.171 --> 00:09:01.950
in customer experience.
So one brand we looked to for inspiration,

150
00:09:01.951 --> 00:09:05.400
sometimes as virgin,
they're in a whole bunch of different businesses,
music,

151
00:09:05.401 --> 00:09:07.380
airlines and so on.
The differences,

152
00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:09.600
the virgin brand is more about being hip and cool,

153
00:09:09.601 --> 00:09:13.410
whereas we just want to be about the very best customer service.

154
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:17.850
So on any given day,
about 75% of our orders are from repeat customers.

155
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.960
And when people ask us,
well,
what does it mean to give great customer service?

156
00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:24.120
Well these are some of the questions we think about.

157
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:27.770
We think about what customers expect and then what they actually experienced.

158
00:09:27.771 --> 00:09:30.810
And so when you go to our website,
I'm sure as many of you know,

159
00:09:30.811 --> 00:09:32.460
we offer free shipping both ways.

160
00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:35.460
So a lot of customers will order 10 different pairs of shoes,

161
00:09:35.461 --> 00:09:38.640
try them on with 10 different outfits in the comfort of their living room and

162
00:09:38.641 --> 00:09:40.890
some Mac,
the ones they don't like or don't want.

163
00:09:40.891 --> 00:09:43.260
And we encourage that type of behavior.

164
00:09:43.261 --> 00:09:46.890
We've actually found that customers with higher return rates,
uh,

165
00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:49.990
maybe on a per order basis are less profitable,
but on a,

166
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.150
in terms of actual dollar basis end up being more profitable than customers that

167
00:09:54.151 --> 00:09:57.420
never return anything at all because they ended up being more comfortable with

168
00:09:57.421 --> 00:10:01.500
the process and trying out new products that they wouldn't normally try out if

169
00:10:01.501 --> 00:10:02.430
it wasn't free shipping.

170
00:10:02.431 --> 00:10:07.050
Both ways we think about what are the stories that they'll tell each other.

171
00:10:07.051 --> 00:10:10.070
And so a lot of our investment actually,
you know,

172
00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:12.900
what we found is on a lot of other ecommerce websites,

173
00:10:12.901 --> 00:10:16.920
most of their investment is on what happens in order to get the customer's

174
00:10:16.921 --> 00:10:17.730
credit card number.

175
00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:21.360
Whereas we really focus on what happens after we get the credit credit card

176
00:10:21.361 --> 00:10:24.810
number from the customer.
And uh,
there's a lot of different things we do.

177
00:10:24.811 --> 00:10:29.160
We run our warehouse 24 seven which actually is not the most efficient way to

178
00:10:29.161 --> 00:10:32.040
run a warehouse,
the most efficient ways to let the orders pile up.

179
00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:36.220
And then the picker has higher picking density when walking around the
warehouse.

180
00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:39.630
That,
but we're not trying to maximize for efficiency of the warehouse.

181
00:10:39.631 --> 00:10:42.090
We're trying to maximize for the customer experience.

182
00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:46.080
And our warehouse is located about 15 minutes from the ups hub in Louisville,

183
00:10:46.081 --> 00:10:48.270
Kentucky.
And because of that,

184
00:10:48.271 --> 00:10:52.500
and because we also do surprise upgrades to overnight shipping for most of our

185
00:10:52.501 --> 00:10:54.000
loyal repeat customers,

186
00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:58.840
a lot of our customers order as late as midnight eastern and then their shoe

187
00:10:58.841 --> 00:11:00.990
show up on their doorstep eight hours later.

188
00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:05.160
And that creates that whole wow experience and an emotional impact that causes

189
00:11:05.161 --> 00:11:09.690
them to remember us for a very long time and tell their friends and family about

190
00:11:09.691 --> 00:11:10.320
us.

191
00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:15.030
We also have a 365 day return policy for people that I guess have trouble

192
00:11:15.031 --> 00:11:17.410
committing or making up their minds.
And uh,

193
00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:20.700
we also have our one h,
you know,

194
00:11:20.701 --> 00:11:24.480
most websites it's very hard to find contact information.

195
00:11:24.481 --> 00:11:28.230
It's usually buried five linx deep and maybe it's an address that you can email

196
00:11:28.231 --> 00:11:31.890
once.
Whereas for us,
we take the exact opposite approach.

197
00:11:31.891 --> 00:11:36.060
We put our one 800 number on the top of every single page of our website because

198
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.190
we actually want to talk to our customers.

199
00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:41.370
And it's funny because sometimes I'll be speaking at advertising or branding

200
00:11:41.371 --> 00:11:44.910
conferences and there's a lot of discussion about consumers being bombarded with

201
00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.410
thousands and thousands of marketing messages every day.

202
00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:51.090
How do you get your message to stand out or how to get your brand to stand out

203
00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:55.540
and as kind of low tech and unsexy as it may sound,

204
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:59.350
our belief is the telephone is one of the best branding devices out there

205
00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:02.860
because you have the customers undivided attention for five to 10 minutes.

206
00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:05.260
And what we found is if we get the interaction right,

207
00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:08.440
that's something that customers remember for a very long time.

208
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.270
And so we've also done studies where we found that customers that do come in

209
00:12:13.271 --> 00:12:17.080
contact with us end up buying more frequently and spending more money.

210
00:12:17.081 --> 00:12:20.380
So we're actually trying to figure out how do we get more customers to call us.

211
00:12:20.381 --> 00:12:24.970
And it may seem weird for an internet company to really want customers to

212
00:12:24.971 --> 00:12:26.350
contact us through the phone.

213
00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:31.420
Most of our phone calls actually do not result in order is only about 5% of our

214
00:12:31.421 --> 00:12:35.770
overall sales volume is through the telephone.
And,
but you know,

215
00:12:35.771 --> 00:12:37.810
customers call for all sorts of different reasons.

216
00:12:37.811 --> 00:12:41.680
Maybe it's their first time going through the returns process and they just need

217
00:12:41.681 --> 00:12:45.370
a little help stepping through,
you know,
how to print out that free return label.

218
00:12:45.371 --> 00:12:49.960
Or maybe they have a wedding this weekend and they just want some fashion

219
00:12:49.961 --> 00:12:53.560
advice.
And,
uh,
we have some customers that call us,

220
00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:58.740
I think just because they're lonely and we'll talk to them as well.

221
00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:00.043
Uh,

222
00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.510
we run our call center very differently from most call centers.

223
00:13:04.511 --> 00:13:08.050
Most call centers are again focusing on efficiency,

224
00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:12.310
viewing that as in the lens of expense minimisation whereas for us,

225
00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:14.050
we really view it through a branding lens.

226
00:13:14.051 --> 00:13:18.130
What can we do to really build the Zappos brand should be about the very best

227
00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:20.860
customer service.
And what we found is that on average,

228
00:13:20.861 --> 00:13:24.160
every customer does call us at least once,
sometime during their lifetime.

229
00:13:24.161 --> 00:13:25.660
And if we'd get that interaction right,

230
00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:29.290
it's something they remember for a very long time and tell their friends and

231
00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:32.470
about.
And that's really what drives a lot of our growth.

232
00:13:32.471 --> 00:13:36.220
So we don't have scripts.
Uh,
we don't measure call times.

233
00:13:36.221 --> 00:13:39.880
Most call centers are all about how many customers can each rep talk to,

234
00:13:39.881 --> 00:13:42.790
which translates into how quickly can you get the customer off the phone.

235
00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:46.180
In fact,
our,
um,
I just found out,
got an email yesterday,

236
00:13:46.181 --> 00:13:50.590
our longest phone call was seven and a half hours long from last week I think.

237
00:13:50.591 --> 00:13:54.860
And I'm not sure how the bathroom situation worked out for that,
but,

238
00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.073
but we,

239
00:13:56.250 --> 00:14:00.280
in fact if someone calls and is looking for a specific pair of shoes,

240
00:14:00.281 --> 00:14:01.840
if we're out of stock of their size,

241
00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:05.050
everyone's trained to look on at least three competitor websites.

242
00:14:05.051 --> 00:14:05.661
If they find it,

243
00:14:05.661 --> 00:14:10.661
they're direct the customer to the competitor and obviously we lose that sale.

244
00:14:10.781 --> 00:14:13.780
But we're not trying to maximize for every single transaction.

245
00:14:13.781 --> 00:14:17.440
We were trying to build a lifelong relationship with our customers.

246
00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:21.730
So for all this about building our brand to be about customer service,

247
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:25.450
customer service is actually not our number one priority.

248
00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:28.690
Our number one priority is company culture.

249
00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:31.390
And our whole belief is that if we get the culture right,

250
00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:35.350
that most of the other stuff like delivering great customer service or building

251
00:14:35.351 --> 00:14:39.520
a long term enduring brand or business will just happen naturally on its own.

252
00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:44.140
So there's a lot of stuff that we really invest in on the culture side and it

253
00:14:44.141 --> 00:14:46.990
starts with the hiring process.
When we hire people,

254
00:14:46.991 --> 00:14:49.750
we actually do two completely different sets of interviews.

255
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:52.970
The first set is kind of your standard stuff that the hiring manager and his or

256
00:14:52.971 --> 00:14:56.480
her team we'll do interview for fit within the team,
relevant experience,

257
00:14:56.481 --> 00:14:58.010
technical ability and so on.

258
00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:02.960
But then we do a second set of interviews done by our HR department purely for

259
00:15:02.961 --> 00:15:06.080
culture fit and they have to pass both in order to be hired.

260
00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:08.780
So we've actually passed on a lot of really smart,

261
00:15:08.781 --> 00:15:12.350
talented people that we know can make an immediate impact on our top or bottom

262
00:15:12.351 --> 00:15:15.530
line.
But if they're not a culture fit,
then we won't hire them.

263
00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.030
And the reverse is true too.

264
00:15:17.031 --> 00:15:20.240
Even if someone is a superstar at their specific job function,

265
00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:23.720
if they're bad for our culture,
we'll fire them just for that reason.

266
00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:28.780
And our performance reviews are 50% based on whether the employee is living in

267
00:15:29.061 --> 00:15:30.710
inspiring the core values of the company,

268
00:15:30.711 --> 00:15:34.130
which is essentially a formalized definition of our culture.

269
00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:38.120
The other thing that we do is everyone that's hired into our headquarters in Las

270
00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:41.750
Vegas,
it doesn't matter what position,
uh,
goes through five weeks of training.

271
00:15:41.751 --> 00:15:45.020
One Week is in Kentucky later on,
uh,
where our warehouses,

272
00:15:45.021 --> 00:15:47.510
they do all the warehouse functions,
picking,
packing,
shipping,

273
00:15:47.511 --> 00:15:48.590
receiving and so on.

274
00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:52.230
But the first four weeks they go through the exact same training,

275
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:56.420
the same training as our call center rep,
and we go over company history,

276
00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:59.660
the importance of company culture,
our philosophy about customer service.

277
00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:03.080
And then you're actually on the phone for two weeks taking calls from customers.

278
00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:04.850
And the reason we have everyone,

279
00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:08.720
regardless of what department they're eventually going to end up and do that is

280
00:16:08.721 --> 00:16:12.950
because if we're serious about building our brand to be about the very best

281
00:16:12.951 --> 00:16:16.940
customer service,
then customer service shouldn't just be a department.

282
00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:21.500
It should be the entire company.
And during that process we,
we,

283
00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:26.390
it's an additional vetting period for us because it's pretty hard to fake and

284
00:16:26.391 --> 00:16:28.840
attitude for that long a period of time.

285
00:16:28.841 --> 00:16:31.700
And there's actually been people that have,

286
00:16:31.701 --> 00:16:35.360
we've had to let go during that process because they felt customer service was

287
00:16:35.361 --> 00:16:40.280
beneath them.
And uh,
this is all before they actually started their actual job.

288
00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:43.310
The other thing we do is at the end of the first week of training,

289
00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:47.420
we make an offer to the entire class and the offers this,

290
00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:51.800
we will pay you for the time you've already spent training plus a bonus of

291
00:16:51.801 --> 00:16:55.160
$2,000 to quit and leave the company right now.

292
00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:57.560
And that's a standing offer until the end of the training.

293
00:16:57.561 --> 00:17:02.561
And then we actually extended a couple of months after that and up to $3,000.

294
00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:06.560
And the reason we do that is because we want,
you know,

295
00:17:06.561 --> 00:17:08.720
in Las Vegas there's plenty of other call centers.

296
00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:13.720
Starting pay is $11 an hour and we don't want someone that's there just for a

297
00:17:13.731 --> 00:17:14.210
paycheck.

298
00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:17.500
We want employees that are there because they really believe in the longterm

299
00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:21.620
vision of the company and really feel like this company culture is one that they

300
00:17:21.621 --> 00:17:23.870
want to be a part of and contribute to.

301
00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:28.040
And only about two or 3% of people end up taking the offer.

302
00:17:28.041 --> 00:17:31.340
When we first started this offer a few years ago,

303
00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:35.570
it actually started out at $100 and we keep upping the offers now at two or

304
00:17:35.571 --> 00:17:40.420
$3,000 because we feel like not enough people are taking the offer.
Uh,

305
00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:45.650
but our original intention was actually to weed out the people that would have

306
00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:49.100
probably left the company who had been fired six or nine months down the road.

307
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:53.910
But what we found is the biggest benefit to it is actually from the people that

308
00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:57.720
don't take the offer because they still have to go home over the weekend,

309
00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:01.200
talk to their friends and family and ask themselves,

310
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:04.890
is this a company that I really believe in and want to commit to?

311
00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:07.150
And when they decided to turn down that easy,

312
00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:11.640
two or $3,000 when they come back to the office on Monday through that much more

313
00:18:11.641 --> 00:18:13.680
engaged and passionate and committed.

314
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:17.190
And by far that's been the biggest benefit of a of doing that.

315
00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:20.940
The other thing we have is something called a culture book,
which a,

316
00:18:20.941 --> 00:18:24.510
I'll give instructions later on for how to get one for free.

317
00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:28.110
But it's something we put out once a year and we've done it for I think six

318
00:18:28.111 --> 00:18:28.944
years now.

319
00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:32.960
And we ask all our employees to write a few paragraphs about what the Zappos

320
00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:36.360
culture means to them.
And except for Typos it's unedited.

321
00:18:36.361 --> 00:18:40.230
So it's like when you go to Amazon customer reviews of a product,

322
00:18:40.231 --> 00:18:45.180
these are essentially employee reviews of the company and it's also,

323
00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:46.310
it's organized by departments.

324
00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:49.560
So you can see how the warehouse culture might be slightly different from the

325
00:18:49.561 --> 00:18:52.560
accounting culture.
And I'll make that freely available.

326
00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:55.650
We also train everyone on how to use Twitter.

327
00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:00.240
If you go to twitter.zappos.com there's a link where you can see the 500 or so

328
00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.430
Zappos employees that are active on Twitter.

329
00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:07.820
And there's another page where you can see in a aggregated a page of all all the

330
00:19:08.041 --> 00:19:09.120
employees tweets together.

331
00:19:09.121 --> 00:19:12.210
So that can also give you a pretty good sense of our culture.

332
00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:15.210
So for the next several years,

333
00:19:15.211 --> 00:19:19.410
at least the way we're thinking of the Zappos brand is internally we referred to

334
00:19:19.411 --> 00:19:23.580
it as the three C's,
clothing,
customer service and culture.

335
00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:27.400
And this is essentially based on the lifecycle of the customer.

336
00:19:27.401 --> 00:19:31.530
So customers that have never heard of Zappos have no idea what we do.
Uh,

337
00:19:31.531 --> 00:19:34.950
we want them to know that we have a great selection of clothing and footwear and

338
00:19:34.951 --> 00:19:37.560
other product categories.
Once they know about that,

339
00:19:37.561 --> 00:19:40.740
then we want them to know that we're all about the very best customer service.

340
00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:44.340
And that's not something that so much we tell them as they experience when they

341
00:19:44.341 --> 00:19:47.820
call our call center or experience that surprise upgrade to overnight shipping

342
00:19:47.821 --> 00:19:50.400
or see how easy the free return shipping is.

343
00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:53.940
And once they know that we're all about the very best customer service,

344
00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:57.360
then we want them to know about our culture and our core values because that's

345
00:19:57.361 --> 00:20:00.150
really the platform that makes everything possible.

346
00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:03.540
So we've actually had customers tell us that when they get that perfect pair of

347
00:20:03.541 --> 00:20:07.680
shoes or perfect outfit that's apples is happiness in a box.

348
00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:12.390
So whether it's the happiness that employees that that customers feel when they

349
00:20:12.391 --> 00:20:16.440
get that perfect outfit or the happiness that customers feel when they

350
00:20:16.441 --> 00:20:20.430
experience great service or have a great customer experience or the happiness

351
00:20:20.431 --> 00:20:24.540
that employees feel from being part of a culture where the core values of the

352
00:20:24.541 --> 00:20:26.670
company match their own personal values.

353
00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:31.170
The thing that really ties all of these things together that we realize is that

354
00:20:31.171 --> 00:20:33.810
Zappos is really just about delivering happiness,

355
00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:35.970
whether it's customers or employees.

356
00:20:35.971 --> 00:20:38.940
And we apply that same philosophy to vendors as well.

357
00:20:38.941 --> 00:20:42.210
And so hence the title of my book that just came out.

358
00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:46.350
So wanted to talk about to a books.
When you come on the tour,
you'll,

359
00:20:46.351 --> 00:20:49.360
first thing you see in our lobby is the Zappos library.

360
00:20:49.361 --> 00:20:51.430
And we have about 30 or 40 titles there.

361
00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:56.020
And it's a not a lending library,
it's actually giving library.

362
00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:59.590
The books are freely available to employees and to visitors alike.

363
00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:04.900
But two of the titles that we really,
uh,
really that I,

364
00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:09.400
and also I personally really like are good to great by Jim Collins and tribal

365
00:21:09.401 --> 00:21:10.234
leadership.

366
00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:14.950
And in fact we had partnered with the authors of tribal leadership to the Audio

367
00:21:14.951 --> 00:21:18.370
version is actually available for free to download from the Zappos website.

368
00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:22.270
And in fact we even teach classes on both of these books at Zappos.

369
00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:27.340
And the reason why I find both of these books interesting is because the authors

370
00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:31.480
did their research and looked at what separated the great companies in terms of

371
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:34.780
longterm financial performance from just the good ones.

372
00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:38.530
And they found that there were two important ingredients that the great

373
00:21:38.531 --> 00:21:40.420
companies had,
that the good ones are me too.

374
00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:44.230
Mediocre ones generally didn't have and and they were actually surprised by what

375
00:21:44.231 --> 00:21:46.300
the,
what they found through the research.

376
00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:50.440
And the first ingredient that they found the great companies had was uh,

377
00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:53.020
they all had very strong cultures.

378
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:58.830
And so we formalize the definition of art culture into 10 core values and the

379
00:21:59.861 --> 00:22:03.220
differences the,
a lot of,
especially larger corporations have,

380
00:22:03.221 --> 00:22:07.630
they might call them core values or guiding principles or uh,
or so on.

381
00:22:07.631 --> 00:22:09.880
The problem is usually they're very lofty sounding.

382
00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:13.870
They kind of read like a press release that the marketing department put out and

383
00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:18.900
maybe you learn about it on day one of orientation and then it becomes this

384
00:22:18.911 --> 00:22:21.520
meaningless pack on the lobby wall.
For us,

385
00:22:21.521 --> 00:22:25.600
we actually wanted to come up with committable core values and by committable we

386
00:22:25.601 --> 00:22:29.320
mean we're willing to hire or fire people based on them independent of their

387
00:22:29.321 --> 00:22:32.650
actual job performance.
And when you use that criteria,

388
00:22:32.651 --> 00:22:35.380
it's actually a pretty hard list to come up with.

389
00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:38.680
And we actually spent a year coming up with it.

390
00:22:38.681 --> 00:22:42.880
It wasn't just a few high level executives spend a weekend at an offsite and

391
00:22:42.881 --> 00:22:46.690
came up with the list.
Uh,
instead,
this was about five years ago,

392
00:22:46.691 --> 00:22:50.590
I emailed the entire company and just ask them,
what should our core values be?

393
00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:52.960
Got a whole bunch of different responses back.

394
00:22:52.961 --> 00:22:56.200
And then we went back and forth for a year and then finally came up with our

395
00:22:56.201 --> 00:23:00.400
list of 10 core values.
So this is our list of 10.
Uh,
you can actually,

396
00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:02.560
if you do a Google search for Zappos core values,

397
00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:04.900
it should be the first thing that pops up.

398
00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:09.130
The other actually interesting litmus test for when we were trying to come up

399
00:23:09.131 --> 00:23:12.180
with our core values and in general,
uh,
to,

400
00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:15.940
to think about for any company that's thinking of core values is if you do a

401
00:23:15.941 --> 00:23:20.650
Google search for any one of these individual core values on almost all of them,

402
00:23:20.651 --> 00:23:25.300
Zappos is the number one result or,
or on the first page.

403
00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:30.040
And for almost any other companies,
uh,
if you searched for their core values,

404
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:33.460
they're nowhere to be found if you search for them one at a time.

405
00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:36.520
So we actually have interview questions for each and every one of these.

406
00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:40.720
Probably the one that trips us up the most in the hiring process is the last
one.

407
00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:43.090
Be Humble cause there's a lot of really smart,

408
00:23:43.091 --> 00:23:45.740
talented people out there that are also egotistical.

409
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.250
And for us it's just not a question,
we just won't hire them.

410
00:23:49.251 --> 00:23:54.080
But it's one of those things that is actually probably the hardest to have an

411
00:23:54.081 --> 00:23:57.050
interview question for cause we can't say how humble are you and they say I'm

412
00:23:57.051 --> 00:23:58.340
the most humble person in the world.

413
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:02.810
But one way we actually test for this is uh,

414
00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:06.560
you know I talked about how we'll pick you up from the airport and Zappos

415
00:24:06.561 --> 00:24:08.600
shuttle and give you two or wolf welfare candidates.

416
00:24:08.601 --> 00:24:11.170
A lot of them are from out of town,
do the same thing,
pick,

417
00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:12.890
pick them up and his apple shuttle,

418
00:24:12.891 --> 00:24:15.950
give them a tour and then afterwards they'll spend the day interviewing.

419
00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:17.840
At the end of the day of interviews,

420
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:21.620
the recruiter will actually go back to the shuttle driver and ask how he or she

421
00:24:21.621 --> 00:24:25.460
was treated.
And if they weren't treated well,
it's not even question.

422
00:24:25.461 --> 00:24:29.150
It doesn't matter how well the day of interviews went.
We won't hire that person.

423
00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:32.420
Uh,
and so number three,
I'll give some examples,

424
00:24:32.421 --> 00:24:34.070
create fun and a little weirdness.

425
00:24:34.071 --> 00:24:38.270
One of our interview questions is on a scale of one to 10,
how weird are you?

426
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:40.520
And,
uh,
you know,
if you're one,

427
00:24:40.521 --> 00:24:43.190
you might be a little bit too straight laced for the Zappos culture,

428
00:24:43.191 --> 00:24:45.720
10 maybe a little bit to psychotic for us.
Um,

429
00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.770
but really it's not so much the number that we care about.

430
00:24:48.771 --> 00:24:53.300
It's a how they answer because our belief is that everyone is a little weird

431
00:24:53.301 --> 00:24:53.781
somehow.

432
00:24:53.781 --> 00:24:57.410
And this is really more just a fun way saying that we really recognize and

433
00:24:57.411 --> 00:25:01.280
celebrate each person's individuality and we want their true personalities to

434
00:25:01.281 --> 00:25:03.410
come out and shine in the workplace.
You know,

435
00:25:03.411 --> 00:25:08.411
there's so many people where there are different person at home on weekends

436
00:25:08.421 --> 00:25:13.130
versus when they're inside the office and people in Corporate America leave a

437
00:25:13.131 --> 00:25:16.850
little bit of themselves or in a lot of cases,
big part of themselves at home.

438
00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:20.510
And we really strive to create an environment where people are just comfortable

439
00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:24.290
being themselves.
So instead of worrying about work life separation,

440
00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:28.790
it's about work life integration where it's just the same person.
And uh,

441
00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:31.400
you know,
not only are you comfortable being yourself,

442
00:25:31.401 --> 00:25:36.050
but when you connect with your coworkers,
it's not just coworker relationships,

443
00:25:36.051 --> 00:25:39.980
but a true friendships that end up forming where you would choose to hang out

444
00:25:39.981 --> 00:25:43.340
with these people even if you weren't working at the same company together.

445
00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.350
And so for example,
for managers,

446
00:25:45.351 --> 00:25:50.030
we actually encourage them to spend 10 to 20% of their time outside the office,

447
00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:54.430
uh,
with their team and whoever they work with.
And initially,
uh,

448
00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.000
the reaction we get back,

449
00:25:56.001 --> 00:26:00.110
especially from people from other companies as well is that sounds fun,

450
00:26:00.111 --> 00:26:04.640
but is it really working?
Uh,
I had endless list of things to do,

451
00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:08.720
but then we go back and survey the managers that have done it and we asked them

452
00:26:08.721 --> 00:26:11.840
how much more productive and efficient is your team because,
uh,

453
00:26:11.841 --> 00:26:14.390
communication is better.
There's higher levels of trust.

454
00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:17.210
People are willing to do favors for each other cause they're doing favors for

455
00:26:17.211 --> 00:26:18.680
friends,
not just coworkers.

456
00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:22.340
And the answers we get back in terms of increased productivity range anywhere

457
00:26:22.341 --> 00:26:25.010
from 20% to 100% more productive.

458
00:26:25.011 --> 00:26:27.410
So kind of worst case scenario,

459
00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:31.390
you're breaking even and having more fun with it.
Um,

460
00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:35.390
number four,
be adventurous,
creative and open minded.

461
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:39.650
One of our questions for the interview is on a scale of one to 10,

462
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:42.110
how lucky are you in life?
One is,

463
00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:44.580
I don't know why bad things always seem to happen to me,

464
00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:48.780
and 10 is I don't know why good things always seem to happen to me.
Well,

465
00:26:48.781 --> 00:26:51.810
we don't want to hire the ones because they're bad luck and they'll bring bad

466
00:26:51.811 --> 00:26:55.810
luck to Zappos.
That's not good for us.
Um,

467
00:26:55.860 --> 00:27:00.860
but this was actually inspired by a research study I'd read about a few years

468
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:04.350
ago where they actually asked that exact same question to random group of
people,

469
00:27:04.351 --> 00:27:05.730
got answers all over the board.

470
00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:10.470
And then afterwards they had the subjects do a task and the task was to go

471
00:27:10.471 --> 00:27:14.970
through a newspaper and count the number of photos that were in that newspaper.

472
00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:18.120
And when they were done,
give the answer to the researcher.

473
00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:22.590
But what the participants didn't know was that it was actually a fake newspaper

474
00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:25.620
and sprinkled throughout the newspaper where these headlines that would say

475
00:27:25.621 --> 00:27:28.500
things like if you're reading this headline,
you can stop.

476
00:27:28.501 --> 00:27:33.210
The answer's 37 plus collect an extra hundred dollars.

477
00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:37.860
And what they found was that the people that consider themselves unlucky in life

478
00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:41.390
generally didn't notice the headlines.
You know,

479
00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:44.670
they went through the task at hand and eventually came up with the right answer.

480
00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:48.600
And the people that consider themselves lucky in life generally stopped early

481
00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:50.550
and made an extra hundred dollars.

482
00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:55.790
So the takeaway is that it's not so much that people are inherently lucky or

483
00:27:56.371 --> 00:27:57.204
unlucky,

484
00:27:57.210 --> 00:28:01.470
but luck is really more about being open to opportunity beyond just how the task

485
00:28:01.471 --> 00:28:03.060
or situation presents itself.

486
00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:07.260
And so that's why we asked that question for a core value.
Number four,

487
00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.140
one of our other core values is about being open.

488
00:28:10.141 --> 00:28:13.890
And honest and we really embrace transparency,
whether it's with our customers,

489
00:28:13.891 --> 00:28:17.820
with our employees or with our vendors.
So for example,
with our customers,

490
00:28:17.821 --> 00:28:22.821
we last quarter we have a quarterly all hands meeting and last quarter we

491
00:28:23.161 --> 00:28:25.140
actually live stream that on the Internet for,

492
00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:29.700
to the public for employees we have this monthly newsletter called ask anything

493
00:28:29.701 --> 00:28:31.530
where it's literally that they can ask,
employees,

494
00:28:31.531 --> 00:28:34.890
can ask about financials or what brands we're going to carry or really any

495
00:28:34.891 --> 00:28:38.820
question we want and we'll get the right person to answer that question and then

496
00:28:38.821 --> 00:28:43.260
compile it all with the questions anonymously and then send it out as a

497
00:28:43.261 --> 00:28:45.060
newsletter to our employees once a month.

498
00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:47.490
And with our vendors we have an extra net,

499
00:28:47.491 --> 00:28:52.480
we work with about 1500 different brands and they can all log into our extranet,

500
00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:56.280
our backend system in viewed the exact same information our own buyers and

501
00:28:56.281 --> 00:29:00.600
merchandisers can see so they can see on hand inventory,
uh,
what sales,

502
00:29:00.601 --> 00:29:03.030
our profitability,
markdowns and so on.

503
00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:07.480
And when we first opened this up to them,
their response was,
great,

504
00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:09.270
I love all this extra information,

505
00:29:09.271 --> 00:29:12.240
but aren't you worried the information is going to get into the hands of

506
00:29:12.241 --> 00:29:15.870
competitors.
And I'm sure realistically at some,

507
00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:19.080
some of the information probably does make its way into the hands of competitors

508
00:29:19.081 --> 00:29:21.600
at some point.
But on the flip side,

509
00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:26.630
we now have an extra 1500 pairs of eyes helping us co manage our business and

510
00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:27.780
they're not on our payroll.

511
00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:30.870
And a lot of times they'll catch stuff that our own buyers and merchandisers

512
00:29:30.871 --> 00:29:35.460
might miss because our buyers and merchandisers have portfolios of anywhere from

513
00:29:35.461 --> 00:29:40.290
20 to 30 brands.
So they may miss that one style that's taking off.
And our,
um,

514
00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:41.740
in our brand partners,

515
00:29:41.741 --> 00:29:45.370
I really just focused on this and logging and several times a day reading the

516
00:29:45.371 --> 00:29:46.480
nightlys,
you know,

517
00:29:46.481 --> 00:29:50.650
re reports and it really just makes them a true partner in the business.

518
00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:54.330
So this is a common reaction.
We get happy for you.
Zappos,

519
00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:56.680
you have this great culture,
but,
uh,
you know,

520
00:29:56.681 --> 00:29:59.500
the stuff you do would never work at my company.

521
00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:02.200
And what's interesting is that the,

522
00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:05.080
from the research that was done in good to great,

523
00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:09.430
what they found was that it actually doesn't matter what your core values are.

524
00:30:09.431 --> 00:30:14.410
So I'm not up here trying to say other companies should adopt the Zappos culture

525
00:30:14.411 --> 00:30:18.220
and core values because in most cases that would probably not be the right

526
00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:21.670
choice,
the right decision for another company.

527
00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:26.940
But what I am saying is that having core values that you actually commit to Ma

528
00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:30.100
is what matters is not what the core values are themselves.

529
00:30:30.101 --> 00:30:33.940
And what they found was the most important thing in their research was that you

530
00:30:33.941 --> 00:30:36.940
had a strong culture,
that you had alignment throughout the organization.

531
00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:40.750
That's where the real power comes from.
And when we rolled out our core values,

532
00:30:40.751 --> 00:30:44.950
it was actually one of those things that even myself kind of resisted initially,

533
00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:48.130
initially cause it felt like one of those big corporate things to do.

534
00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:52.030
But what we found was when we really committed to them and truly committed,

535
00:30:52.031 --> 00:30:56.140
meaning willing to hire and fire people based on them willing to do performance

536
00:30:56.141 --> 00:31:00.880
reviews based on them what within a relatively short period of time,
we've,

537
00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:06.150
the entire organization really changed when it became integrated in our language

538
00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.770
and our default way of thinking.

539
00:31:08.771 --> 00:31:13.771
And it empowers every single employee to really make decisions for themselves.

540
00:31:14.681 --> 00:31:18.880
They just need to ask what's our longterm vision and is this more in line with

541
00:31:18.881 --> 00:31:21.730
our core values or less aligned with our core values.

542
00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:24.220
And it also enables employees to call each other out front,

543
00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:26.650
whether even if they're in different departments or if it's a front line

544
00:31:26.651 --> 00:31:30.070
employee calling out a VP.
So we found that it's been hugely,

545
00:31:30.071 --> 00:31:35.071
hugely powerful and really is what enables us to scale our culture.

546
00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:39.730
And the part of it is the only way as culture can scale.
You know,

547
00:31:39.731 --> 00:31:43.870
most companies as they get bigger than company culture goes downhill over time.

548
00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:46.390
Uh,
not only do we not want that to happen,

549
00:31:46.391 --> 00:31:48.250
but we actually wanted to get stronger and stronger.

550
00:31:48.251 --> 00:31:51.760
And the only way that can happen is if every employee views as part of his or

551
00:31:51.761 --> 00:31:56.350
her job description,
uh,
living in inspiring the culture in others.

552
00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:00.580
And so one analogy I like to think of sometimes is like when you watch the

553
00:32:00.581 --> 00:32:03.310
discovery channel and over the Serengeti or whatever,

554
00:32:03.311 --> 00:32:07.870
there's 50,000 of flock of 50,000 birds flying.
And if you take a step back,

555
00:32:07.871 --> 00:32:11.860
it looks like this one giant organism that's flying in unison.

556
00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:16.720
And the reality is there is no head bird that is leading the group.

557
00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.370
But what there are,
are varies.

558
00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:23.380
Every bird has pretty much the same DNA and they have very simple instructions

559
00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:25.990
encoded in their DNA,
like stayed this many,

560
00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:28.930
this many number of inches away from the bird on the right,

561
00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:33.610
this many from the left and so on.
And when they all follow those same rules,

562
00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:35.170
they're able to flock together.

563
00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:40.350
And so analogously at the core values are like the DNA that enables the versus

564
00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:44.990
function as a unit that whether it's,
you know,
10 birds or 50,000 birds.

565
00:32:44.991 --> 00:32:48.050
And that's really how we're thinking of how we're going to scale the company

566
00:32:48.051 --> 00:32:52.970
culture at Zappos.
Um,
I'm not,
I'm going to make this presentation available,

567
00:32:52.971 --> 00:32:54.620
but uh,
you know,

568
00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:59.660
sometimes the reaction that we get from other other companies is,

569
00:32:59.661 --> 00:33:02.540
okay,
you're an internet company.
I use special rules apply to you.

570
00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:07.280
And the reason why I included those other stories in there are because one of

571
00:33:07.281 --> 00:33:11.300
them for example,
is the Atlanta refrigeration company in Atlanta,
Georgia.

572
00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:13.760
They do refrigeration repairs out in the field.

573
00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:18.050
And so in some ways you can't think of a more opposite company or industry.

574
00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:23.080
Then Zappos and they came through our offices and then actually went through our

575
00:33:23.511 --> 00:33:27.680
Zappos insights program where we help them figure out their core values and how

576
00:33:27.681 --> 00:33:29.210
to build their own strong cultures.

577
00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:32.630
And then they went back and within a relatively short period of time,
uh,

578
00:33:32.631 --> 00:33:35.750
their customers are happier,
their employees are happier.
It's really neat,

579
00:33:35.751 --> 00:33:39.980
actually seen the before and after pictures and their profits and revenues are

580
00:33:39.981 --> 00:33:44.000
up.
So it's just pretty cool seeing the same concepts apply and work in other

581
00:33:44.001 --> 00:33:44.834
industries.

582
00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:48.140
So going back to the good to great and tribal leadership talked about how there

583
00:33:48.141 --> 00:33:48.974
were,
uh,

584
00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:52.790
two important ingredients that separated the great companies from just the good

585
00:33:52.791 --> 00:33:57.550
ones.
First one was culture.
And then the second one was that,
and this again,

586
00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:59.420
I think surprised the researchers,

587
00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:04.130
was that the great companies had a vision that had a higher purpose beyond just

588
00:34:04.131 --> 00:34:07.340
money or profits or being number one in a market.

589
00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:12.550
And kind of the irony there is that by not making profits the number one

590
00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:16.250
priority of the company,
uh,
or the higher purpose of the company,

591
00:34:16.251 --> 00:34:21.251
it actually enabled these companies to generate more profits in the longterm.

592
00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:23.930
So sometimes when I speak at entrepreneur conferences,

593
00:34:23.931 --> 00:34:28.100
I get asked what's a good market to go into where they can make a lot of money?

594
00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:29.660
And my response to them is,

595
00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:32.630
instead of thinking about where you can make a lot of money,

596
00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:35.120
think about what are you so passionate about doing that?

597
00:34:35.121 --> 00:34:39.020
You'd be happy doing it for 10 years.
And even if you never made a dime,

598
00:34:39.021 --> 00:34:40.550
and that's what you should be doing.

599
00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:44.320
And kind of the ironic thing is the money will actually follow.
So,
you know,

600
00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:48.920
we've all heard of craigslist.
Uh,
he didn't set out to make money.

601
00:34:48.921 --> 00:34:52.160
He was passionate about the community and now it's one of the top trafficked

602
00:34:52.161 --> 00:34:56.270
websites on the internet.
So I like to say chase the vision,
not the money.

603
00:34:56.740 --> 00:34:58.660
There was a movie that came out a,
uh,

604
00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:01.870
I think a couple of years ago I called notorious.
Uh,

605
00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:04.880
I think it only lasted a week in the movie theater,
but,
um,

606
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:08.840
but I saw it and a in it biggie smalls,

607
00:35:08.841 --> 00:35:12.770
also known as notorious Vig,
uh,
is well,

608
00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:17.480
puff daddy says to biggie smalls,
don't chase the paper,
chase the dream.

609
00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:21.200
I just want an excuse to put this picture up

610
00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:27.530
anyways.
So if you're an entrepreneur,
say,

611
00:35:27.531 --> 00:35:30.080
think about what would you be so passionate about doing that?

612
00:35:30.081 --> 00:35:33.620
You'd be happy doing it for 10 years,
even if you've never made a dime from it.

613
00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:35.880
And if you have employees met,

614
00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:39.360
what's the larger vision and greater purpose in their work beyond just money or

615
00:35:39.361 --> 00:35:44.190
profits or being number one in a market.
And there's a lot of,
um,

616
00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:44.521
you know,

617
00:35:44.521 --> 00:35:48.930
consultants in books that talk about how to motivate employees and they work to

618
00:35:48.931 --> 00:35:51.300
a certain extent.
And there's different ways you can motivate employees.

619
00:35:51.301 --> 00:35:54.300
You can motivate them through incentives.
A lot of companies do that.

620
00:35:54.301 --> 00:35:57.030
You can mode motivate them through recognition.

621
00:35:57.180 --> 00:36:01.650
A lot of corporate American motivates through fear.
Uh,

622
00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:05.250
but our belief is that there's a huge difference between motivation and

623
00:36:05.251 --> 00:36:06.090
inspiration.

624
00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:10.200
And if you can inspire your employees through a vision that has a greater

625
00:36:10.201 --> 00:36:13.500
purpose beyond just money or profits or being number one in a market,

626
00:36:13.501 --> 00:36:18.000
and if you can inspire employees by having and committing to corporate core

627
00:36:18.001 --> 00:36:20.040
values that match their own personal values,

628
00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:23.880
then you can accomplish so much more and you don't really need to worry about

629
00:36:23.881 --> 00:36:26.760
the motivation part of it.
So,
uh,

630
00:36:26.761 --> 00:36:30.870
this is a look at how the Zappos brand has evolved over the years.

631
00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:32.840
In 1999 are we,

632
00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:37.500
our vision was let's just have the largest selection of shoes online.

633
00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:41.550
And,
and then about four years into it,
we sat around and asked ourselves,

634
00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:43.620
what do we want to be when we grow up?

635
00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:47.640
Do we want to be about shoes or do we want to be about something more
meaningful?

636
00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:50.850
And that's when we decided we wanted our brand to be about the very best

637
00:36:50.851 --> 00:36:54.570
customer service.
And when we did that like something,

638
00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:58.710
it's kind of surprised us what happens suddenly once we communicated it out to

639
00:36:58.711 --> 00:36:59.341
our employees,

640
00:36:59.341 --> 00:37:03.060
we found that employees were suddenly a lot more engaged and passionate about

641
00:37:03.061 --> 00:37:07.470
the company and when customers called and they could sense that the person on

642
00:37:07.471 --> 00:37:09.780
the end of the phone wasn't there just for a paycheck,

643
00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:12.240
but truly wanted to provide great service.

644
00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:14.520
And when vendors came and visited our offices,

645
00:37:14.521 --> 00:37:18.820
we've found that they wanted to stay longer or come more frequently because uh,

646
00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:22.530
that enthusiasm we're off onto them,
rubbed off onto them.

647
00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:28.110
And then in 2005 was when we rolled out our core values and decided not only do

648
00:37:28.111 --> 00:37:29.550
we want culture to be important,

649
00:37:29.551 --> 00:37:33.750
but we in fact want it to be the number one priority of the company.

650
00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:34.710
Because if we get that right,

651
00:37:34.711 --> 00:37:38.280
then the customer service will come naturally as a byproduct of that.

652
00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:41.310
And in 2007,
we started asking ourselves,
okay,

653
00:37:41.311 --> 00:37:44.640
what do we mean by great customer service?
There's lots of different ways to do,

654
00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:49.620
uh,
give great service.
Amazon is a customer centric company as well,

655
00:37:49.621 --> 00:37:52.770
but they have a different approach.
They're more about high tech and,

656
00:37:52.771 --> 00:37:57.740
and removing friction.
And whereas we really want to do the more,
uh,
human,
uh,

657
00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:02.780
have the more human connection so we're more high touch instead of high tech and

658
00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:05.370
really develop that personal emotional connection with them.

659
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:09.270
And then 2009 was when we took a step back and realize really the thing that

660
00:38:09.271 --> 00:38:11.880
ties all of this together is just about delivering happiness,

661
00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:17.100
whether it's the customers or employees or vendors as well.
So,

662
00:38:17.101 --> 00:38:18.870
um,
one is just tell another pizza story.

663
00:38:18.871 --> 00:38:22.890
And this actually happened a couple of years ago in Santa Monica,
California.
And,

664
00:38:23.370 --> 00:38:27.780
uh,
I was speaking at a sketchers sales conference and it was a long day.

665
00:38:27.781 --> 00:38:31.200
And then at the end of the day we decided to go bar hopping in the Santa Monica

666
00:38:31.201 --> 00:38:35.040
area.
And Cause I,
I never done that before.
And I,

667
00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:38.680
I've gone bar hopping but not bar hopping in the Santa Monica area before.

668
00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:43.150
And so I think there were three of us from Zappos,
three people from Skechers.

669
00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:47.400
One of the brands that we work with went to the first bar order to rent.

670
00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:50.890
Someone ordered a round of drinks.
And then,
because it had been a long day,

671
00:38:50.891 --> 00:38:52.570
someone ordered a round of shots.

672
00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:57.600
And so we took the shots and drink the drinks and then went to the second bar

673
00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:01.030
and someone else ordered a round of drinks to pay back for the first round of

674
00:39:01.031 --> 00:39:01.864
drinks.

675
00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:05.080
And then someone else ordered around a shots to pay back for that first amount

676
00:39:05.081 --> 00:39:08.080
of shots and you can't waste alcohol.

677
00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:11.890
So we took the shots and we finished the drinks and then we went to the third

678
00:39:11.891 --> 00:39:16.891
bar and then actually don't remember how many drinks or shots we had after that.

679
00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:22.510
But what I do know is that your last call is 2:00 AM in California.

680
00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:26.980
And,
uh,
lights went on and then we started heading back to the hotel room.

681
00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:28.333
And,
um,

682
00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:33.040
and one of the girls from Skechers was talking about this pepperoni pizza that

683
00:39:33.041 --> 00:39:36.550
she was craving and asked if we wanted to go on and on it.
And we said,
yeah,

684
00:39:36.551 --> 00:39:41.170
that sounds great.
You know,
we'd been drinking pretty hungry.
And uh,
she's like,

685
00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:44.740
oh,
I cannot wait to like go order the room service.

686
00:39:44.741 --> 00:39:48.610
Like I checked it out on the room service menu before we left.
It was on page 17.

687
00:39:48.611 --> 00:39:52.750
It was the second item down.
And uh,
when it comes,
I know it's going to be hot,

688
00:39:52.751 --> 00:39:54.940
so I'm not going to let it burn the roof of my mouth.

689
00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:57.100
I'm going to like smell it first.
And we look,

690
00:39:57.101 --> 00:40:00.580
the odors go in and it was only a five minute walk,

691
00:40:00.581 --> 00:40:04.090
but it seemed much longer than that because she would not stop talking about the

692
00:40:04.091 --> 00:40:06.070
pepperoni pizza.
So anyways,

693
00:40:06.071 --> 00:40:09.070
we finally wind up in the hotel room and she's all excited.

694
00:40:09.071 --> 00:40:14.071
She calls room service and then 10 seconds later she hangs up the phone all

695
00:40:15.641 --> 00:40:19.330
dejected.
And I asked her what's wrong?

696
00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:22.390
And apparently at that hotel,

697
00:40:22.391 --> 00:40:25.690
they don't serve hot food after 11:00 PM.

698
00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:29.350
And so she was really dejected and sad.

699
00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:32.190
And so to try to cheer up,
I say,
well,

700
00:40:32.191 --> 00:40:34.870
did you know in college I used to make pepperoni pizzas?

701
00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:39.850
And she looked at me and he was like,
that's so not helpful right now.

702
00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:44.800
And then the three of us from Zappos and you're like,
oh.

703
00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:48.590
And we were more than a little bit inebriated,

704
00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:51.460
say called Zappos called Zappos will take care of you.

705
00:40:51.461 --> 00:40:53.080
We're all about the best customer service

706
00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:59.440
and in our minds that really was the funniest thing ever.

707
00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:00.490
And uh,

708
00:41:00.491 --> 00:41:05.491
and so she actually took us up on our dare and put the phone on speaker phone

709
00:41:06.791 --> 00:41:08.950
called Zappos and,
uh,
you know,

710
00:41:08.951 --> 00:41:11.320
the rest of us are in the background trying not to make a new noise,

711
00:41:11.321 --> 00:41:16.060
but you know,
trying to laugh as quietly as possible.
And,
uh,

712
00:41:16.061 --> 00:41:18.820
in the rep said,
thanks for calling Zappos,
how can I help you?

713
00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:23.290
And sketchers girl says,
oh,
thank goodness you answered.

714
00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:27.850
I'm in Santa Monica right now and been eyeing this thing on the room service

715
00:41:27.851 --> 00:41:30.580
menu.
Page 17,
item number two,
pepperoni pizza.

716
00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:34.520
But they don't serve hot food after 11:00 PM kind of hotel does not serve hot

717
00:41:34.521 --> 00:41:37.520
food after 11:00 PM is there anything you can do for me?

718
00:41:42.850 --> 00:41:46.820
First there was an awkward silence
and then the reps it,
you know,

719
00:41:46.821 --> 00:41:50.510
he called Zappos,
right?
We sell shoes,

720
00:41:50.511 --> 00:41:55.430
we sell clothes,
we don't sell pizza yet

721
00:41:57.330 --> 00:41:59.030
in the sketchers girl said,
yeah,

722
00:41:59.031 --> 00:42:03.430
but I heard you're all about the very best customer service and the rest of it.

723
00:42:03.431 --> 00:42:04.264
Okay,
hold on

724
00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:09.050
and put us on hold for two minutes and then came back and listed the five

725
00:42:09.051 --> 00:42:12.890
closest places in the Santa Monica area that we're still open and delivering

726
00:42:12.891 --> 00:42:17.270
pizza at that hour.
Now I hesitate a little shells the story,

727
00:42:17.271 --> 00:42:20.930
cause I don't want all of you to start calling Zapples ordering pizza.

728
00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:21.970
But you know,

729
00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:26.980
obviously we don't have a process of procedure for late night drunk pizza

730
00:42:27.231 --> 00:42:31.250
orders.
But,
but I just,

731
00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:34.370
I think it's just a fun story because if you get the culture right and make sure

732
00:42:34.371 --> 00:42:36.620
everyone understands the longterm vision of the company,

733
00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:39.380
you don't need a process and procedure for everything.

734
00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:44.110
And these types of situations,
these stories are just created automatically,
uh,

735
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:48.170
literally for us thousands and thousands of times every single day.

736
00:42:48.290 --> 00:42:53.120
And that's how we've really built our brand.
So,
um,

737
00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:59.330
uh,
well,
which it was 3:00 AM by that time.
So we,
we,
uh,

738
00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:02.810
we did not actually end up ordering the pizza,
but,
um,

739
00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:07.990
but she actually went back and put together this care package for the rep and

740
00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:10.430
the rep is very happy now and,

741
00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:13.280
but now she's a customer for life and has probably,

742
00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:17.700
she's told that story I'm sure many,
many times.
And,
and,

743
00:43:17.701 --> 00:43:18.970
and that's really what,
you know,

744
00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:22.460
these are the types of things that we think about.
Like where the store,

745
00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:25.520
where does the story begin and where does it end?
And for us,

746
00:43:25.521 --> 00:43:28.400
the story doesn't end when we get the credit card.

747
00:43:28.401 --> 00:43:32.480
It's really just this ongoing lifelong relationship with,
uh,
with customers.

748
00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:36.650
And we're really think of ourselves as being in the stories and memories,

749
00:43:36.651 --> 00:43:40.250
business experience or experiencing emotions business.

750
00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:43.970
And so that's what eventually led us to really think about building the brand to

751
00:43:43.971 --> 00:43:48.200
be about happiness or delivering happiness.
So,
um,

752
00:43:48.830 --> 00:43:53.210
wanted to,
uh,
take a step back from all this business talking,

753
00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:56.330
actually have you guys think about this question,

754
00:43:56.331 --> 00:44:00.710
what is your goal in life?
And,

755
00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:04.880
and so whatever your actual,
uh,
you know,
answers,
think about that.

756
00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:07.550
And what's interesting is that if you actually asked different people this

757
00:44:07.551 --> 00:44:09.620
question,
you'll get all sorts of different answers.

758
00:44:09.621 --> 00:44:12.380
Some people will say to grow a company when people would say,

759
00:44:12.381 --> 00:44:17.090
get a great job or get a boyfriend,
girlfriend,
and then ask yourself why.

760
00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:21.680
So whatever you had as your goal in life,
ask yourself why.

761
00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:26.840
And then people will come up with different,
uh,
answers,
retire early,

762
00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:31.100
make money,
find a soulmate,
uh,
and then ask yourself why again,

763
00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:34.830
and you know,
people will come up with the next set of answers,

764
00:44:34.831 --> 00:44:38.430
but if you keep asking yourself why over and over again,

765
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.950
what's interesting is that eventually everyone ends up with the same answer.

766
00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:46.740
And that's whatever their goal in life is.

767
00:44:46.741 --> 00:44:50.100
Whatever they're pursuing they believe will make them happier.

768
00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:55.020
So a couple of years ago,
having nothing to do with Zappos,

769
00:44:55.021 --> 00:44:59.260
I started reading books and articles and so on,
uh,
about,
uh,

770
00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:02.850
this field of research that's essentially about the signs of happiness.

771
00:45:02.851 --> 00:45:07.530
The formal name for it is positive psychology and it actually didn't exist prior

772
00:45:07.531 --> 00:45:10.050
to 1998.
So I'm not talking about,
you know,

773
00:45:10.051 --> 00:45:13.380
go do the self help section of a bookstore and read books that say,

774
00:45:13.381 --> 00:45:15.310
think positive and you'll be happy.
Uh,

775
00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:19.560
I'm talking about actual research that's been done in prior to 1998 almost all

776
00:45:19.561 --> 00:45:24.150
of psychology was about looking at people that had something wrong with them and

777
00:45:24.151 --> 00:45:25.980
then figuring out how to make them more normal,

778
00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:28.200
but almost nobody bothered to study.

779
00:45:28.650 --> 00:45:31.590
How do you look at normal people and make them happier?

780
00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:35.820
So just more as a hobby and everything.
I thought,
oh,
that's pretty interesting.

781
00:45:35.821 --> 00:45:39.720
And so I started reading books and articles on the topic and one of the

782
00:45:39.721 --> 00:45:43.710
consistent things that has come out of the research is that people are very bad

783
00:45:43.711 --> 00:45:46.500
at predicting what will make them happy in the long term.

784
00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:49.850
Most people think once I get x,
then I'll be happier.
Once I choose x,

785
00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:53.010
then I'll be happy when the research shows that's not true.

786
00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:55.710
There are studies of lottery winners.
For example,

787
00:45:55.711 --> 00:45:58.770
you look at their happiness level right before winning the lottery and then look

788
00:45:58.771 --> 00:46:01.860
at their happiness level a year later and a year later it's the same or maybe

789
00:46:01.861 --> 00:46:05.490
even a little bit lower than it was right before they won the lottery.

790
00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:07.470
And the reverse is true as well.

791
00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:11.910
There's people that have become unexpectedly blind and you look at their

792
00:46:11.911 --> 00:46:13.830
happiness level a year later in a year later,

793
00:46:13.831 --> 00:46:18.180
it's actually a right back to where it was before they became blind.

794
00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:21.250
So I thought this was interesting and then started thinking about it and uh,

795
00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:25.440
both for my own personal life but also for businesses as well.

796
00:46:25.441 --> 00:46:30.360
Because if people are bad at predicting what will make them happy,
then us.

797
00:46:30.361 --> 00:46:30.751
For us,

798
00:46:30.751 --> 00:46:35.610
trying to build a brand around customer service isn't just as simple as asking

799
00:46:35.611 --> 00:46:37.980
customers what do they want?
Because they may not know.

800
00:46:38.290 --> 00:46:39.480
And same thing for employees.

801
00:46:39.481 --> 00:46:42.630
If we're trying to build a culture with a lot of happy employees,

802
00:46:42.810 --> 00:46:47.220
you can't always just ask employees what it is that will make them happy because

803
00:46:47.370 --> 00:46:50.940
they,
what the research has shown is that people are bad at predicting what will

804
00:46:50.941 --> 00:46:55.500
actually make them happen.
And you know,
for our business and yours as well,

805
00:46:55.501 --> 00:47:00.120
there's a lot of science behind a lot of stuff we do.
We look at conversion,

806
00:47:00.121 --> 00:47:03.600
a customer acquisition metrics,
repeat customer behavior and so on.

807
00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:06.300
And I don't know what the right percentage is,

808
00:47:06.301 --> 00:47:10.500
but if the ultimate goal is happiness,
then you know,

809
00:47:10.501 --> 00:47:13.500
what percent of your time do you want to spend studying and learning about the

810
00:47:13.501 --> 00:47:14.311
science of happiness,

811
00:47:14.311 --> 00:47:18.030
how much happier could you be and how much could that potentially help your

812
00:47:18.031 --> 00:47:22.050
business,
whether it's in dealing with employees or customers or vendors.

813
00:47:22.730 --> 00:47:22.890
You know,

814
00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:27.000
a lot of people go through decades trying to get to this ultimate destination of

815
00:47:27.001 --> 00:47:28.500
happiness.
And then when they get there,

816
00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:32.470
realize it's either very short lived or maybe not even there at all.

817
00:47:32.650 --> 00:47:35.820
What if by studying the signs of happiness,
you know,

818
00:47:35.821 --> 00:47:38.860
and the research that's already been done,
just reading up on it a little bit,

819
00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:43.000
you can kind of maybe skip some of the steps and just go straight to the

820
00:47:43.001 --> 00:47:45.430
happiness part of it.
So I thought that was interesting.

821
00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:49.240
So I just wanted to share a few different frameworks to kind of cliff notes

822
00:47:49.241 --> 00:47:53.470
version of what I thought was interesting from the stuff that I've read about.

823
00:47:53.770 --> 00:47:57.160
And the first a frameworks is that happiness is really just about four things.

824
00:47:57.161 --> 00:48:00.550
Perceived control,
perceived progress,
connectedness,

825
00:48:00.551 --> 00:48:04.660
meaning the number in depth of your relationships and vision are meaning being

826
00:48:04.661 --> 00:48:06.850
part of something bigger than yourself.

827
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:10.660
And what's interesting is that you can not only apply this to you your own life,

828
00:48:10.661 --> 00:48:14.740
but you can apply it to a business as well.
So for example,

829
00:48:14.741 --> 00:48:16.990
for perceived progress in our merchandising,

830
00:48:16.991 --> 00:48:20.290
each department we used to hire employees entry level.

831
00:48:20.590 --> 00:48:22.990
And then give them all the training and mentorship and so on.

832
00:48:22.991 --> 00:48:27.760
They get certified and then they'd get a promotion 18 months later and then they

833
00:48:27.761 --> 00:48:31.690
get another,
uh,
you know,
set of training and certification.

834
00:48:31.691 --> 00:48:34.600
And then 18 months after that they'd get a promotion to become a buyer,

835
00:48:34.601 --> 00:48:37.120
which within Zappos is a pretty big deal.

836
00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:39.910
So it took him three years to become a buyer.
Well,

837
00:48:39.911 --> 00:48:42.460
instead of giving a promotion every 18 months,

838
00:48:42.461 --> 00:48:46.420
we changed it a few years ago so that we gave smaller promotions every six

839
00:48:46.421 --> 00:48:49.420
months.
And even though nothing had changed,

840
00:48:49.421 --> 00:48:53.560
they still had to go through the same certification and mentorship and training

841
00:48:53.561 --> 00:48:55.330
and so on.
Except we found that,

842
00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:57.850
and it still took them exactly three years to become a buyer.

843
00:48:57.970 --> 00:49:01.000
But we found that because there was this ongoing sense of perceived progress,

844
00:49:01.150 --> 00:49:05.920
that employees were much happier and it costs the company nothing to do that.

845
00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:09.400
Another,
uh,
framework is Maslow's hierarchy.

846
00:49:09.401 --> 00:49:12.700
There's a great book called peak by Chip Conley Pak,

847
00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:17.760
where he actually condenses this into three levels and applies it to employees

848
00:49:18.281 --> 00:49:22.840
and customers and investors as well.
And so for example,

849
00:49:22.841 --> 00:49:23.980
for employees,

850
00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:28.660
the three levels of the pyramid are in terms of what they think of their work,

851
00:49:28.661 --> 00:49:32.230
whether they think of it as a job versus career versus calling.

852
00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:34.750
And our whole goal at Zappos is to move them up.

853
00:49:34.751 --> 00:49:38.890
The pyramid to think of their time at Zappos has a calling and we'd still want

854
00:49:38.891 --> 00:49:40.720
employees at Zappos 10 years from now.

855
00:49:40.721 --> 00:49:44.710
And the only way that's going to happen is if we provide all the training and

856
00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:45.940
mentorship and so on,

857
00:49:45.941 --> 00:49:48.970
so that they feel like they're growing both personally and professionally.

858
00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:51.240
And so we offer a lot of different classes.
Uh,

859
00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:56.170
we have 30 or 40 different courses now and they're not just professional
courses.

860
00:49:56.171 --> 00:50:00.170
There's also,
for example,
one on this,
the science of happiness that,
uh,

861
00:50:00.310 --> 00:50:04.100
that helps them with their personal growth as well.
And,
uh,

862
00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:07.390
the last framework I want to share,
it was three different types of happiness,

863
00:50:07.391 --> 00:50:09.310
pleasure,
engagement and meaning.

864
00:50:09.930 --> 00:50:13.300
The first type I like to call the Rockstar type of happiness cause it's about

865
00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:17.420
always chasing the next high.
And it's great if you can sustain it.
Uh,

866
00:50:17.421 --> 00:50:22.421
the problem is it's very hard to sustain unless you're basically a rock star and

867
00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:26.890
it's what the research has shown is out of these three types of happiness,

868
00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:30.350
as of as soon as your sources stimming light goes down,
it goes away.

869
00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:33.860
Your happiness level just drops right back down to where it was before.

870
00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:35.810
The second type is called flow.

871
00:50:35.811 --> 00:50:39.440
There's a book by the same name and it's about those moments and we've all

872
00:50:39.441 --> 00:50:40.221
experienced this.

873
00:50:40.221 --> 00:50:43.730
For some people it might be while running for other people it might be painting,

874
00:50:43.731 --> 00:50:48.320
but it's about when you're so into something that you're doing that three hours

875
00:50:48.321 --> 00:50:51.080
passed by.
But it seems like only 20 minutes have passed by.

876
00:50:51.590 --> 00:50:55.130
And a con and other attributes that,
uh,

877
00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:59.900
that are associated with this are that you lose a sense of self consciousness or

878
00:50:59.901 --> 00:51:02.780
even self because you're so into what you're doing.

879
00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:06.290
And professional athletes referred to it as being in the zone where peak

880
00:51:06.291 --> 00:51:07.940
performance meets peak engagement.

881
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:11.870
And kind of the strategy there is just notice when that happens and then either

882
00:51:11.871 --> 00:51:14.420
change who you hang out with,
your,

883
00:51:14.421 --> 00:51:18.410
your friends or your environment or your job or where you live to try to have

884
00:51:18.650 --> 00:51:20.930
that type of occurrence happened more frequently.

885
00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:24.290
And with the research has shown is that this is actually the second longest

886
00:51:24.291 --> 00:51:27.200
lasting type of happiness.
And the third type,

887
00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:29.390
it's about being part of something bigger than yourself.

888
00:51:29.391 --> 00:51:33.230
And so that might mean for some people volunteering for their favorite charity

889
00:51:33.231 --> 00:51:34.064
for example.

890
00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:38.390
And what the research has shown is this is actually the longest lasting type of

891
00:51:38.391 --> 00:51:39.224
happiness.

892
00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:42.230
So what I thought was interesting is most people go through life chasing after

893
00:51:42.231 --> 00:51:45.830
the first type thinking.
Once I could sustain it on an ongoing basis,

894
00:51:45.831 --> 00:51:49.310
which is pretty much impossible,
then I'll uh,
worry about the second type.

895
00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:50.750
And then if I ever get around to it,

896
00:51:50.751 --> 00:51:54.230
then I'll worry about the third type when based purely on the data from the

897
00:51:54.231 --> 00:51:54.890
research,

898
00:51:54.890 --> 00:51:59.390
the proper strategy should be focused on the third type of happiness first.

899
00:51:59.750 --> 00:52:01.880
And then layer on,
on top of that,
the second type.

900
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:04.970
And then the first one's really just icing on the cake.

901
00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:07.560
So a some books that I recommend,
uh,

902
00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:10.640
probably the one that's made the biggest impact on my life over the past five

903
00:52:10.641 --> 00:52:12.410
years is happiness hypothesis.
Uh,

904
00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:17.000
the author looks at a whole bunch of different religions,
philosophers and uh,

905
00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:22.310
Eh,
and,
and religions philosophies and cultures from different time periods.

906
00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:27.320
And each of them has a different belief as to what happiness means or how to

907
00:52:27.321 --> 00:52:28.490
achieve it.
Uh,

908
00:52:28.491 --> 00:52:31.850
but then what I found was interesting is he compares their beliefs to actual

909
00:52:31.851 --> 00:52:35.570
scientific research that's been done and then either agrees or disagrees with

910
00:52:35.571 --> 00:52:38.870
different parts of their beliefs.
Um,
you can email me,

911
00:52:38.871 --> 00:52:42.100
tony@deliveringhappinessbooks.com,
uh,

912
00:52:42.110 --> 00:52:46.670
or tony@zappos.com will work as well,
uh,
for a copy of this presentation.
Uh,

913
00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:49.880
also the culture book I talked about,
happy to send out for free.

914
00:52:49.881 --> 00:52:52.550
It's actually on backorder I think a couple of weeks right now,

915
00:52:52.551 --> 00:52:53.600
but as soon as it gets in,

916
00:52:53.601 --> 00:52:56.770
we'll send it out to you next time you're in Las Vegas.
Uh,

917
00:52:57.230 --> 00:52:59.360
if you come for a tour Monday through Thursdays,

918
00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:03.720
tours.zappos.com and,
uh,

919
00:53:04.010 --> 00:53:06.230
just wanted to end with,
you know,

920
00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:10.820
the research has shown that great businesses are the ones that are able to

921
00:53:10.821 --> 00:53:14.350
combine profits,
passion and purpose.
Uh,

922
00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:16.160
and what I thought was really interesting,

923
00:53:16.161 --> 00:53:20.930
and this was kind of a weird Aha moment for me when I took a step back,

924
00:53:20.931 --> 00:53:23.360
was that the research from the science of happiness,

925
00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:26.250
it's about being able to combine pleasure or passion and purpose.

926
00:53:26.251 --> 00:53:27.690
So in a weird way,

927
00:53:27.691 --> 00:53:31.530
it's almost like what makes for great businesses on this,

928
00:53:31.531 --> 00:53:36.270
like a fractal of,
uh,
what makes sense for individual happiness.

929
00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:40.920
And this is really what we're trying to achieve at Zappos and what we're hoping.

930
00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:45.100
What I'm hoping that the book will that just came out,
will,
uh,

931
00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:46.380
help other businesses,

932
00:53:46.381 --> 00:53:51.381
is really think about happiness as a business model and just want to leave you

933
00:53:53.161 --> 00:53:55.830
guys with thinking about what percent of your time do you want to spend learning

934
00:53:55.831 --> 00:53:59.760
about the science of happiness and how can learning about it really help

935
00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:03.000
yourself personally,
your business or your brand.

936
00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:08.250
And if the research shows that businesses that have a higher purpose actually

937
00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:12.270
are able to achieve more longterm profits,
uh,

938
00:54:12.271 --> 00:54:15.810
and if the research shows that,
you know,
for you personally,

939
00:54:15.811 --> 00:54:20.811
if you have a higher purpose that actually leads to more happiness,

940
00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:24.180
then I don't think about what is Your Business,

941
00:54:24.210 --> 00:54:28.880
your company is higher purpose in what is your own higher purpose.
You know,

942
00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:33.450
and I'm not up here trying to sell more shoes,
uh,

943
00:54:33.930 --> 00:54:37.290
but if you go through this presentation,

944
00:54:37.291 --> 00:54:42.000
you've been inspired to focus more on making customers happier by really

945
00:54:42.210 --> 00:54:44.610
thinking more about the customer experience or customer service,

946
00:54:44.611 --> 00:54:49.611
or you've been inspired to really make employees happier by focusing more on

947
00:54:50.190 --> 00:54:51.240
company culture,

948
00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:54.630
or you've just been inspired to make yourself happier by learning a little bit

949
00:54:54.631 --> 00:54:59.100
more about the science of happiness.
If any of those things have happened,

950
00:54:59.101 --> 00:55:04.101
then I'll have done my part in helping Zappos achieve our higher purpose,

951
00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:09.750
which is all about delivering happiness to the world.
Thank you very much.
