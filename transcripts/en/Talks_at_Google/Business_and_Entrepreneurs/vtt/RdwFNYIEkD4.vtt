1
00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.190
Robert,
thank you for being here.
We're happy to have you.
Um,

2
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.570
so as we just learned in the video,
food and security is very personal to you.

3
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.310
Can you talk more about that?

4
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.620
<v 2>Sure.
Yeah.
Um,
uh,
by parents were Korean,
uh,</v>

5
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.070
from South Korea and they essentially moved over,
uh,

6
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.830
without really knowing any English.

7
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.950
And so my dad was a civil engineer and my mom was a banker.
Uh,

8
00:00:29.951 --> 00:00:31.260
but when they came over to the states,

9
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.000
they really didn't matter because they didn't know any English.
And,

10
00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:38.490
um,
so I remember times when we just,
you know,

11
00:00:38.491 --> 00:00:43.260
a one huge bowl ramen for a meal for the whole day because that was pretty much

12
00:00:43.261 --> 00:00:47.050
it.
Um,
and you know,
as I mentioned in the video that I get it,

13
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.430
you just think that's going wall and knew just kind of live with bed.
But,
um,

14
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.290
it was to the point where I just hated ramen cause,
uh,

15
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.420
you would just have so much.
But you know,

16
00:00:57.421 --> 00:01:02.421
I grew up with kind of that kind of environment and my parents were always

17
00:01:02.671 --> 00:01:06.750
telling me about how,
you know,
uh,
any food that you,

18
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.440
I'm sure people have the same experience in terms of,
you know,

19
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.680
stories that they're told.

20
00:01:10.681 --> 00:01:15.681
But I was told that any food that I would waste would basically have to be eaten

21
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.090
in my afterlife all at once.
So,
so,
um,
you know,

22
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.880
I kind of grew up with the values of,
you know,
never wasting food and,

23
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.790
and really cherishing food whenever we had it.
So,
yeah.

24
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.430
<v 0>Okay,
cool.
So now,</v>

25
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.370
and you want to see an on hero award and you're on Forbes 30 under 30 social

26
00:01:35.371 --> 00:01:39.990
entrepreneurs,
Leicester parents was to be very brand.
Um,
so what prompted you,

27
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.750
you left a very secure job in finance and you started RLC.
What,

28
00:01:43.751 --> 00:01:44.670
what prompted that?

29
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.910
<v 2>Oh man,
so many things.</v>

30
00:01:46.911 --> 00:01:51.080
I think because the two issues were so close to me and so personal,

31
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.210
I think,
um,
having the opportunity to kind of give back in this way,
uh,

32
00:01:56.211 --> 00:01:58.280
in such a direct and common sense,

33
00:01:58.281 --> 00:02:02.630
way and efficient way and the opportunity to scale a solution,

34
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.070
uh,
that,
you know,
was,
was such a huge problem.
Food,

35
00:02:07.071 --> 00:02:10.850
waste and hunger and all these different kind of facets of those two things.

36
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.910
And,
you know,
while I was working at your firm,
Morgan,

37
00:02:13.911 --> 00:02:17.300
I kind of compared my time of how much time I was spending,
you know,

38
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.820
what impact that had I should Morgan,

39
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.310
and the same amount of time and impact it would have at rescuing electric

40
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.740
cuisine.
I was just two,

41
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.720
two worlds apart and I just couldn't kind of,
um,

42
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.530
you know,
take it anymore and then wants to do something more meaningful with,

43
00:02:33.531 --> 00:02:36.580
with my time and had an outlet to do it.
So I took the opportunity,

44
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.890
took the risk and uh,
yeah,
it was,
it was great.

45
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.600
<v 0>The risk analyst we took over.
It's great.</v>

46
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.150
Thank you.
Um,
so,
okay,
so what was the process of starting RLC?

47
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.190
<v 2>Yeah.
So starting Rlc,
uh,
pretty much came,
uh,
from,</v>

48
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.440
uh,
way back into college.

49
00:02:56.441 --> 00:03:01.060
So during college was when I came across the of food rescue.
Um,

50
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.270
there was a club that brought leftover dining hall food to homeless shelters,

51
00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:08.230
calls two birds,
one stone and Nyu and Nyu.

52
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.620
And it basically kind of opened my eyes to food rescue as a concept and to the

53
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:18.190
fact that food can be donated and that there's so much excess food.

54
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.770
Um,
so we were basically,
uh,
you know,
uh,

55
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.750
uh,
uh,
a bunch of us for a couple of friends and I were a kind of executive board

56
00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:32.770
members of that club and kind of expanded it throughout the four years of Nyu

57
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.510
because it started out as just one kind of dining hall,
too,
one homeless shelter.

58
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.030
Uh,
but eventually you kind of,
uh,

59
00:03:40.031 --> 00:03:43.270
under our leadership we're able to grow it out to all the difference,

60
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.390
a dining halls and basically growing up.
Um,

61
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.440
and that kind of opened my eyes to the fact that it's not just dining halls,

62
00:03:50.441 --> 00:03:54.610
it's also restaurants and different food businesses that can donate their food.

63
00:03:54.611 --> 00:03:58.390
And that there's such a huge need at homeless shelters.
Um,

64
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.540
and so that kind of first experience paved the way for kind of the first inkling

65
00:04:04.241 --> 00:04:07.600
of an idea of,
of RLC add two birds,
one stone.

66
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.650
We kind of did everything on like a Google spreadsheet or core night.
Yeah.

67
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.140
Coordinating all these different volunteers and things like that.

68
00:04:14.141 --> 00:04:19.141
But we had this dream of having a automated system that would connect excess

69
00:04:19.601 --> 00:04:24.601
food to homeless shelters and have volunteers be the solution because during

70
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.570
college years we had the time to actually do a bunch of research and figure out

71
00:04:28.571 --> 00:04:29.321
that,
you know,

72
00:04:29.321 --> 00:04:34.321
solutions to food rescue in terms of food rescue existed and had a really great

73
00:04:35.531 --> 00:04:40.060
impact in terms of great work of city harvest and food bank and things like
that.

74
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.310
But there were a little bit of a gap of how much,
uh,
you know,

75
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.190
food there was out there versus what they could pick up.

76
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.810
And so we wanted to basically tackle that specific gap and an operating that

77
00:04:52.811 --> 00:04:57.100
niche with the model that we kind of learned and perfected during the college

78
00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.660
years.
And so we took all of that.

79
00:04:58.661 --> 00:05:03.520
It's kind of together and then entered into a venture competition,
uh,

80
00:05:03.521 --> 00:05:06.090
ended up winning some seed money and,
uh,

81
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.490
pretty much launched it from there and kept on going.
All right,
cool.

82
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.980
<v 0>Okay.
So what's the biggest challenge that you've faced as a social enterprise?</v>

83
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.840
<v 2>There's,
there's just so many.
Um,
I think in general,</v>

84
00:05:18.841 --> 00:05:19.471
I think the,

85
00:05:19.471 --> 00:05:23.550
the kind of uncertainty is the biggest challenge is challenging aspect.

86
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.260
Um,
you know,

87
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.430
there's no way to kind of project in terms of how many new food donors are going

88
00:05:29.431 --> 00:05:30.061
to bring on board,

89
00:05:30.061 --> 00:05:33.720
how much pounds of food we're going to be able to bring on board.
But you know,

90
00:05:33.721 --> 00:05:38.370
you kind of,
uh,
rely on,
um,
the,
the different,

91
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:42.340
uh,
you know,
uh,
aspects that you can rely on life that,

92
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.960
how much time you've put in,
how much effort you put in,
how many,
you know,

93
00:05:44.961 --> 00:05:49.200
volunteers you can,
uh,
kind of corral to the cause and,

94
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.660
and you're basically a see what happens.
Um,
you know,

95
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.410
because of how local it is and how small it is.
It,
you know,
it's,

96
00:05:57.411 --> 00:06:01.630
it's sometimes outsize in terms of the expectations of what you would do.

97
00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:06.290
Thank you.
Get out of it.
But,
uh,
it turns out to be really good sometimes.
So,

98
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.220
uh,
I would say like,
you know,
just that,
you know,

99
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.370
unsure if he is like the biggest,
biggest challenge.
Cool.

100
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.810
<v 0>Okay.
So let's talk about food waste,
which is astounding in this country.
Um,</v>

101
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:22.400
we heard a few stats in the video,
like since you're the expert,

102
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:27.250
I would love for you to talk more about all of your wisdom on sure.
Yeah.
I,

103
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:32.210
<v 2>I think,
um,
yeah,
when you think about food waste,
it,
it,
you know,</v>

104
00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:33.880
it's just food waste.

105
00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.960
But when you think about the different facets of what that means,

106
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.780
it's kind of mind blowing because it's not just about food waste,
it,
it's,

107
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:46.540
it's about the environmental impact of that food waste,
a,
the moral implications,

108
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:51.730
uh,
what that food,
you know,
has a potential to do a,
as long as you know,

109
00:06:51.731 --> 00:06:54.250
the,
the actual economic impact of that.

110
00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:57.640
So on kind of the environmental issue,

111
00:06:57.641 --> 00:07:01.720
people don't really know that food waste is,
is one of the largest,

112
00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.860
if not the largest component of a solid waste in the waste stream.

113
00:07:05.861 --> 00:07:10.240
And actually lands in landfills where it basically contributes to carbon

114
00:07:10.241 --> 00:07:11.950
emissions through a methane gases,

115
00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:14.560
which was actually 20 times worse than carbon dioxide.

116
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:19.930
And if you take food waste as a kind of a global emitter of carbon emissions,

117
00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.170
um,
and take it out as if it's like a country,

118
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:25.240
it would rank third right after us and China.

119
00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:30.900
So just as a kind of environmental issue after the fact of wasting food,

120
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:36.550
it's a huge kind of issue.
Uh,
but even,
you know,

121
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.030
kind of going before that supply chain of actually wasting the food,

122
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.740
the amount of land amount of,
you know,

123
00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:47.530
natural resources you use to grow that food is all wasted as well to grow the

124
00:07:47.531 --> 00:07:51.070
food that we all eat in this country,
we use half the US land,

125
00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.630
80% of the u s freshwater,

126
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:57.130
10% of the US energy budget is used to transport that food and trucks and supply

127
00:07:57.131 --> 00:07:59.320
chain and things like that.
So,
you know,

128
00:07:59.321 --> 00:08:04.321
all of that is wasted when your waste 40% of the food that you're producing.

129
00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.020
So,
uh,
it's an environmental impact on both sides.

130
00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:12.990
And so it's a,
you know,
when you combine those things,
it's a huge,
huge,
uh,

131
00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:18.130
non negligible amount.
And that's just the environmental side.

132
00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:19.660
I mean there's,
there's kind of whole,

133
00:08:19.661 --> 00:08:22.870
like there's a whole bunch of studies and things like that and I think there

134
00:08:22.871 --> 00:08:26.620
needs to be more studies on the environmental impact of food waste.

135
00:08:26.621 --> 00:08:31.460
But the NRDC does a really great job,
uh,
of,
of kind of,
you know,

136
00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:33.370
telling people about the issue of food waste.

137
00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:37.750
And one of the other things that they mentioned obviously is the fact that,
um,

138
00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:41.950
you know,
it's,
it's,
there's potential all food waste is,
is huge.

139
00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:47.260
Um,
it's $165 billion problem in the U S I mean,
it's obviously,
you know,

140
00:08:47.261 --> 00:08:48.160
an economic issue.

141
00:08:48.161 --> 00:08:52.300
People are wasted or buying food from the supermarkets and then wasting it.

142
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:57.510
You might as well just not by 40% and know 64% of the food that you're buying at

143
00:08:57.511 --> 00:08:59.680
the supermarket.
So,
um,

144
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.580
it's a huge kind of economic costs as well.

145
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:04.570
Obviously the US energy budget and things like that,

146
00:09:04.571 --> 00:09:06.450
like that's our taxes going into food.

147
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:09.840
That's like going to be wasted like corn subsidies for corn or like why,

148
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.700
why do we do that?
Uh,
it's,
it's a huge,
yeah,
it's a huge kind of,
you know,

149
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:19.590
kind of complex issue and an implication implications that people don't really

150
00:09:19.591 --> 00:09:23.460
think about.
When you think about it on deeper level,
obviously,
you know,

151
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.390
along the lines of potential food waste,
you know,
the,

152
00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.860
the food that's actually going to waste,

153
00:09:28.861 --> 00:09:33.520
I'll fucking see you can feed people so people,
uh,
can be fed with that and,
and,

154
00:09:33.521 --> 00:09:37.410
and what's more important than kind of feeding people that are,
that are,

155
00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:40.530
you know,
hungry and need that food if you're going to be wasting it.

156
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:42.120
And you know,

157
00:09:42.121 --> 00:09:46.440
when you think about the flip side to that equation of kind of food waste and

158
00:09:46.441 --> 00:09:50.310
hunger,
like 49 million Americans are food insecure.

159
00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:53.580
And that,
I mentioned the video.
Like,

160
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.920
if you think about the nutritional,

161
00:09:55.921 --> 00:09:58.750
and obviously poverty is a multifaceted issue as well,

162
00:09:58.751 --> 00:10:01.740
and it's not just nutrition,
but if you think about just nutrition,

163
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:05.000
reducing the 30% of,
uh,

164
00:10:05.001 --> 00:10:08.190
of the wasted food and bringing that directly to the people who are food

165
00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:09.630
insecure would eliminate hunger,

166
00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:15.690
which means that there's still two thirds of kind of food waste leftover that

167
00:10:15.691 --> 00:10:18.690
needs to be reduced as well,
which is why there's,
you know,

168
00:10:18.691 --> 00:10:23.691
the food waste hierarchy of reducing it on source and then feeding people,

169
00:10:23.731 --> 00:10:28.410
feeding animals,
composting,
and then lastly landfill.
But,
you know,

170
00:10:28.411 --> 00:10:32.450
I'm kind of going on and on about weight,
you know,
it's,

171
00:10:32.451 --> 00:10:37.440
it's just so much.
It's so much.
Yeah.
And,
um,
you know,
it's,

172
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:42.390
it's a,
it's a huge,
huge issue.
So how do,
how do we compare it to other countries?

173
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:47.850
The U S uh,
you know,
uh,
throws out a lot.
Uh,
the average,
uh,
that,

174
00:10:47.851 --> 00:10:52.680
that people say is 40% going through reports on the kind of worldwide level.

175
00:10:52.681 --> 00:10:57.300
We waste about 30% of the food that we produce in the world.
Uh,
it's,
it's a lot.

176
00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:02.580
It's a lot.
And,
um,
us is obviously a little bit worse.
Um,

177
00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:06.420
but it's interesting because the US obviously as a developed con,
you know,

178
00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:08.220
one of the developed nations,
uh,

179
00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:11.730
it seems to waste a lot more food on and kind of our end on the consumer end,

180
00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:15.270
which means there's a lot of education that needs to happen in terms of,

181
00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:17.940
you know,
recognizing that food waste is a problem,

182
00:11:17.941 --> 00:11:22.380
but also doing something about it,
uh,
and doing easy things,
uh,
that can be,

183
00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:26.010
you know,
seep simply implemented in all of our lives.
Um,

184
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:27.743
but yeah,

185
00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:31.230
in terms of like developing nations that a lot of their food waste is happening

186
00:11:31.231 --> 00:11:32.190
on the agriculture,
on the,

187
00:11:32.191 --> 00:11:36.090
on the kind of earliest side of the supply chain because they don't have the

188
00:11:36.091 --> 00:11:39.300
technology or they don't have the resources to kind of implement those kinds of

189
00:11:39.301 --> 00:11:44.130
systems that they have in the u s so,
uh,
it's,
it's a shame because,
I mean,

190
00:11:44.131 --> 00:11:46.020
obviously the story that,

191
00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:49.950
that I just mentioned about kind of having enough nutrition in the u s is the

192
00:11:49.951 --> 00:11:53.290
same.
It's,
it's parallel across the world as well for in the world.

193
00:11:53.291 --> 00:11:57.100
If we reduced just one third of the food that we have going waste,

194
00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:02.370
that could be easily enough to eliminate food insecurity in the world.

195
00:12:02.501 --> 00:12:06.790
So,
you know,
we talked about kind of overpopulation and like,
you know,
the,
the,

196
00:12:06.791 --> 00:12:09.130
the fear of,
you know,
feeding everyone and things like that,

197
00:12:09.131 --> 00:12:13.270
but no one's thinking about why not reduce the food waste that we have going on

198
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:17.770
to solve that problem.
I mean,
like,
we don't have to increase production.

199
00:12:17.771 --> 00:12:22.360
We can just be more efficient with the food that we're already producing.
Um,

200
00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:24.160
but,
but yeah,
that's,
you know,

201
00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:28.510
I think overall people are becoming more and more kind of aware of the issue
and,

202
00:12:28.511 --> 00:12:33.010
um,
uh,
I'm glad that people are starting to pay attention.
So,
yeah.
So is it,

203
00:12:33.011 --> 00:12:35.440
is food waste,
is it getting better?
Is it getting worse?

204
00:12:35.441 --> 00:12:36.410
Is it sort of sounds the same?

205
00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:40.750
I think there's not as much data as there needs to be in terms of a kind of

206
00:12:40.751 --> 00:12:42.940
measurement and things like that.
And I think,
uh,

207
00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:45.410
even more granular reports need to be,
uh,

208
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:49.690
published in terms of where specifically in the supply chain food is being

209
00:12:49.691 --> 00:12:51.190
wasted.
But in general,

210
00:12:51.191 --> 00:12:55.240
it seems like the problem with food base is becoming more and more of a

211
00:12:55.241 --> 00:12:59.080
mainstream kind of issue that people are caring about.
Just in terms of,
you know,

212
00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:00.580
the sheer number of articles and,

213
00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:04.360
and tension that people are putting on food waste has been increasing in the

214
00:13:04.361 --> 00:13:06.960
past,
you know,
three to four years.
We're lucky in that we used,

215
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.950
we just started in 2013 and it's been a huge kind of increase in the level of

216
00:13:11.951 --> 00:13:16.180
attention that people are putting into food waste.
So we do believe that,

217
00:13:16.181 --> 00:13:17.170
you know,
it's getting better,

218
00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:21.310
but there's still obviously a lot of work to be done.
Yeah.
Okay.

219
00:13:21.311 --> 00:13:25.990
So you've started RLC,
RLC solving the problem,
how it,

220
00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:29.020
how is it different than other organizations?
Yeah,
that's,

221
00:13:29.021 --> 00:13:32.800
that's pretty much the number one question we always get.
Um,
but,
um,

222
00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:37.110
we started it in 2013 because as I mentioned a little bit earlier,
uh,
we,

223
00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:41.560
we started to notice that there was a kind of a gap or niche,
uh,

224
00:13:41.561 --> 00:13:43.120
and do food rescue space.

225
00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:48.010
And when we kind of started thinking about Kinda outside the board of Nyu and

226
00:13:48.011 --> 00:13:52.270
how food rescue can be applied,
we did a lot of research into kind of city,

227
00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:55.960
city harvest and food bank and even as hard as harvest in Australia and things

228
00:13:55.961 --> 00:13:59.410
like that to figure out what solutions already exist in our,
what was happening,

229
00:13:59.411 --> 00:14:03.330
what was working.
And so we,
uh,

230
00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:05.980
realized that at least for New York City,

231
00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:10.390
the current solutions typically had a minimum pound requirement way there with

232
00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:14.980
Nahko by,
uh,
for food that was under a certain number of pounds.
Um,

233
00:14:14.981 --> 00:14:18.750
so we decided to your essentially target that specific gap that,

234
00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:22.020
that niche market and essentially,
uh,

235
00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:25.810
kind of use our solution to that problem.
So,
you know,

236
00:14:25.811 --> 00:14:28.960
we like to think of ourselves as different in terms of that minimum pound

237
00:14:28.961 --> 00:14:30.430
requirement because we don't have one.

238
00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:35.790
But also in the fact that we use a kind of technology driven process by using a

239
00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:41.320
web application called on Ruby and rails that basically allows people to kind of

240
00:14:41.321 --> 00:14:45.610
sign up online for any pickup they do want and crowdsource that transportation

241
00:14:45.611 --> 00:14:50.560
problem,
that distribution problem between the excess food and the hungry.
So,

242
00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:54.320
um,
yeah,
there's a whole bunch of other kinds of things that we,
you know,

243
00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:58.550
I think one of the other ways we're different in that is that we are much more

244
00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:03.860
scalable and that we have this kind of platform that can just be kind of

245
00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:07.460
basically,
you know,
put to use in different geographic areas,

246
00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:12.630
not just New York City.
Um,
and uh,
you know,
in other models do,

247
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:16.580
you may have to actually own trucks and own trucks and operate trucks and diff

248
00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:18.920
each different city that you're there,
you're running in.

249
00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:22.070
So we don't have that kind of,
you know,
issue.

250
00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:27.820
<v 0>So,
okay.
So with RLC,
there's sort of,
there's three parties.
You have a,</v>

251
00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:32.260
a food partner or a donor,
you have the volunteers and then you have the shelter.

252
00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:36.550
So,
if I'm a food partner,
what does,
what does that look like?

253
00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:38.710
<v 2>Yeah,
for food donor,</v>

254
00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:43.130
we try and make it as easy as possible because there's a,
you know,
it's,

255
00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:47.140
it's sometimes difficult for food donors to kind of feel comfortable about

256
00:15:47.141 --> 00:15:50.610
donating food and there's always so many sigmas and myths around,
you know,

257
00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:55.600
donate food.
Um,
so we try to make it as easy as possible and we kind of cater to,

258
00:15:55.930 --> 00:16:00.220
uh,
the,
uh,
food donors needs.
So,
um,

259
00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:01.510
as a food donor would,

260
00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:06.040
when the partner with RLC diff there first ask pretty much when they throw out

261
00:16:06.041 --> 00:16:09.460
their food and I worked frequency.
Uh,
so for example,

262
00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:14.490
just thinking about any coffee shop a day may have pastries and muffins at the

263
00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.690
end of the night that they,
that they throw out when they're closing out for,

264
00:16:17.691 --> 00:16:22.540
for both,
for the four day.
And so they can tell us,
hey,
you know,

265
00:16:22.541 --> 00:16:22.870
we,

266
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:25.960
we actually have these muffins and pastries that we throw out every single night

267
00:16:25.961 --> 00:16:30.520
at 9:00 PM when we close a,
and what we can do is essentially,
basically,

268
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:35.770
you know,
ensure that we're there at that time every single day,
uh,
and,
uh,

269
00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:39.370
make it super easy for them.
Instead of throwing it out into like a trash bag,

270
00:16:39.371 --> 00:16:42.850
just put it into a different container that they can actually donate.
Um,

271
00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:44.080
we do the transportation,

272
00:16:44.081 --> 00:16:47.280
we do all the kind of paperwork and things like that for them,
uh,

273
00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:51.220
and make it super easy for them to,
you know,
feel the impact and,

274
00:16:51.221 --> 00:16:55.000
and understand that their food is going to the Hungary without actually doing

275
00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:55.923
that much work.

276
00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:59.590
<v 0>Uh,
you mentioned there's,
there's myths about donating food.</v>

277
00:16:59.591 --> 00:17:03.550
So you often hear that it's illegal to donate food.
You can't do it.

278
00:17:03.551 --> 00:17:05.650
And which is why,
you know,
restaurants throw it out.

279
00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.600
But that's not necessarily true,
especially,
yeah.
I'll,

280
00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:09.880
can you talk more about that?

281
00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:14.220
<v 2>Yeah.
The number one kind of pushback we get from restaurants and other food</v>

282
00:17:14.221 --> 00:17:17.340
businesses is that it's illegal.
Um,

283
00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:22.170
which is unfortunately a,
you know,
just widespread for some reason.

284
00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:27.600
Um,
w there's a Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Act of 1996 that's a federal law that

285
00:17:27.601 --> 00:17:32.390
basically protects all food donors from legal liability.
Uh,

286
00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:34.380
you know,
except in the case of gross negligence,

287
00:17:34.381 --> 00:17:37.590
which is basically extreme carelessness.
So,
you know,

288
00:17:37.591 --> 00:17:41.160
as long as they're adhering to all the food safety standards and ensuring that

289
00:17:41.161 --> 00:17:42.050
they are,
you know,

290
00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:45.720
a licensed food vendor and they know how to handle food and doing any food in

291
00:17:45.721 --> 00:17:50.580
the right way,
um,
there's an old legal by liability.
Um,
of course,

292
00:17:50.581 --> 00:17:53.910
you know,
if,
if they throw the food on the ground and then donate,

293
00:17:53.911 --> 00:17:58.830
that's obviously not,
you know,
the,
the same thing.
But the federal law,
um,

294
00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:02.880
you know,
existed since 1996 but,
uh,
all 50 states,

295
00:18:02.881 --> 00:18:06.360
I've also passed state versions of that same exact guess.
Mentoring.
All of the,

296
00:18:06.361 --> 00:18:10.470
in some cases is actually helping to provide even more additional protections

297
00:18:10.471 --> 00:18:13.320
for food donors.
So,
um,
it's,

298
00:18:13.321 --> 00:18:17.850
it's kind of insane too to hear sometimes from restaurants,
uh,
light.

299
00:18:17.851 --> 00:18:20.010
They heard that,
you know,
Mcdonald's got sued for,

300
00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:24.570
for some reason or another about food insecurity and people being sick off of

301
00:18:24.571 --> 00:18:29.390
that,
a food that they donated.
And,
uh,
there's,
there's no legal,
you know,

302
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:33.870
case there's nothing in the kind of case record about that.
Uh,
so it's just,

303
00:18:33.871 --> 00:18:37.620
it's just myths and you know,
people have been doing food rescue for her,

304
00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:41.130
you know,
35,
40 years now.
Um,
and,
and you know,

305
00:18:41.131 --> 00:18:44.730
as long as we are all each hearing to the same food safety standards in ensuring

306
00:18:44.731 --> 00:18:49.380
that the food is safe,
food can be donated and can be completely fine.

307
00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:51.870
So,
um,
yeah,

308
00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:55.350
I think that's the number one kind of education point that that needs to kind of

309
00:18:55.351 --> 00:18:58.470
happen for people to really start understanding that,
you know,

310
00:18:58.471 --> 00:19:00.970
licensed food vendors,
people that are understanding,
you know,

311
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.710
people that can actually prepare the food correctly and safely can donate that

312
00:19:04.711 --> 00:19:07.500
food.
Oh yeah.
Good to know.
Yeah.

313
00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:12.440
<v 0>Um,
so it's so great.
You have restaurants that donate the food.
Um,</v>

314
00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.810
do you report back any data,
you know,

315
00:19:14.811 --> 00:19:18.210
letting them know this is how much you're wasting.
Can you talk about that?

316
00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:22.900
<v 2>Yeah.
Yeah.
So one of the kinds of benefits that we provide for restaurants,
uh,</v>

317
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:26.280
is the data piece because,
um,
the,

318
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:30.420
there's a hierarchy of kind of what food waste should go to.

319
00:19:30.421 --> 00:19:32.630
I haven't mentioned it a little bit.
Um,
the,

320
00:19:32.631 --> 00:19:37.600
the kind of number one thing is to reduce it from the get go.
Um,

321
00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:42.240
and uh,
you know,
for that,
it pretty much is,
uh,

322
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:46.340
thinking about creative ways to use excess food and things like that.
Uh,

323
00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:51.100
or just just from the,
from the very production of it just don't produce that.
Um,

324
00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:53.870
and so we provide monthly,
uh,

325
00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:58.970
data in terms of days and number of pounds on how much food is being donated and

326
00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:02.490
thus would have been wasted if they didn't work with us.
Uh,

327
00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:06.780
and what that allows the partners to do is essentially kind of analyze that data

328
00:20:06.781 --> 00:20:08.760
and see,
oh,
hey,
um,
you know,

329
00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:13.470
I did not expect that much food to be going to waste.
Um,
you know,

330
00:20:13.471 --> 00:20:17.340
there's a lot of partners that we've worked with initially that has given us

331
00:20:17.341 --> 00:20:19.800
estimates like,
oh yeah,
it's going to be about 40 pounds.

332
00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:23.610
And it turns out not to be 40 pounds for the first two or three weeks,

333
00:20:23.611 --> 00:20:25.290
turns out to be like over a hundred pounds.

334
00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:29.850
And that's because they're just not measuring it.
And you know,
just like any KPI,

335
00:20:29.851 --> 00:20:32.610
you're not,
if you're not measuring it,
you can't do anything about it.
Right.

336
00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:34.650
And so,
you know,

337
00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:39.630
basically having that monthly data allows them to do,
not just,
you know,

338
00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:44.070
looking at and measuring out food waste data,
but also thinking about,
oh hey,

339
00:20:44.071 --> 00:20:48.640
like every Monday or every weekend and we seem to have much food than food
waste.

340
00:20:48.641 --> 00:20:51.460
And then,
you know,
other days and they can use that,

341
00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:55.150
internalize that and basically reduce it on their own.
Cool.
It's a big Lee,

342
00:20:55.151 --> 00:20:58.240
you know,
food donors want to obviously,
you know,

343
00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:00.880
keep every single sale that they have.

344
00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.910
So there's always going to be a little bit of food that is going to go to waste.

345
00:21:03.911 --> 00:21:07.420
But we typically see like the numbers kind of,
you know,
start,

346
00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:10.120
come down and plateau over time.
Um,

347
00:21:10.121 --> 00:21:14.470
and that's why I wanted the kind of key things that we like to do is ensure
that,

348
00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:18.370
you know,
we're measuring our food waste in terms of our success metrics,

349
00:21:18.371 --> 00:21:22.870
but also keeping in mind that we don't want necessarily have more pounds of
food.

350
00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:24.880
We keep,

351
00:21:24.881 --> 00:21:29.881
we retain our kind of main KPI and may main kind of success measure as a number

352
00:21:30.011 --> 00:21:34.330
of partners.
Um,
because that's the real kind of measures yes.
Uh,
in,

353
00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:39.130
in terms of what we're thinking.
Cool.
So before we get to volunteers,

354
00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:41.620
let's talk about,
so the shelters or the food recipients,

355
00:21:41.621 --> 00:21:45.240
what does it look like for them?
Yeah,
so for the food Vince,

356
00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:47.970
they're typically a homeless shelters,
soup kitchens,
food pantries,

357
00:21:47.971 --> 00:21:51.420
community centers,
things like that,
license there,
five,
one C,

358
00:21:51.421 --> 00:21:55.600
three a nonprofit authorizations.
And typically,
um,

359
00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:59.220
what happens is after we find a,
uh,
homeless,
uh,

360
00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:02.850
a restaurant partner that has a certain number of pounds of food and they give

361
00:22:02.851 --> 00:22:05.490
us an equitation of like what type of fluid is going to go to waste.

362
00:22:05.491 --> 00:22:09.660
And things like that and can be donated.
Um,
we go and match that up.
Uh,

363
00:22:09.661 --> 00:22:10.320
we have great,

364
00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:14.910
wonderful staff that help us do this and they basically help match,

365
00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:19.650
um,
the,
the food to what food is needed at the homeless shelters,

366
00:22:19.651 --> 00:22:24.120
soup kitchens and food pantries.
Um,
and that way it can be a regular recurring,

367
00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:28.950
um,
food item that can basically offset the food that's,
you know,

368
00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:33.660
that they would normally buy.
So,
um,
being an expected,

369
00:22:33.661 --> 00:22:37.380
they know how much,
you know,
typically on average is going to be a,

370
00:22:37.381 --> 00:22:41.910
and essentially they can take that out of the food budget.
Um,
and so,

371
00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:46.940
uh,
that kind of partnership,
uh,
really starts with that food donor.
And,
and,

372
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:49.950
um,
on the food recipient side,
they receive it.

373
00:22:49.951 --> 00:22:54.250
They give us a receipt that basically helps us measure the number of pounds.
Uh,

374
00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:58.940
and how many,
you know,
that,
that basically goes back to the food donor and,
uh,

375
00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:02.170
helps us maintain our records.
Kurtz.
So for the shelters there,

376
00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:05.380
their goal is probably that they would never have to buy food.

377
00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:10.120
That's the goal for them because they still do.
They still do.
They still do it.

378
00:23:10.121 --> 00:23:14.500
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
It's insane.
There's this,
there's just so much food out there.

379
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:16.770
Um,
but you know,
it's,

380
00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:20.200
it's always about the right type of food because different homeless shelters

381
00:23:20.201 --> 00:23:23.030
have different requirements because they do different services,
right?

382
00:23:23.031 --> 00:23:26.590
It's like some of them do just breakfast or it's something to do just dinner.

383
00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:27.641
And so,
you know,

384
00:23:27.641 --> 00:23:32.320
bringing a bunch of bagels to like solid on that just does dinner's not helpful.

385
00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:36.970
Uh,
so it's just making that matching and then that's kind of,
you know,
uh,
where,

386
00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:41.140
um,
we can,
you know,
make that a matching matching happen.

387
00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:46.280
Cool.
Um,
okay,
so let's talk about volunteers because without

388
00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:50.210
<v 0>volunteers,
the organization doesn't really run.
Yeah,</v>

389
00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:53.930
I mean answers rather reasons,
but yeah.
Um,
so,

390
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:58.150
so what does it look like if you are a volunteer?
If you sign up to volunteer?

391
00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:02.850
<v 2>So anyone can go online and sign up to volunteer at screen,</v>

392
00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:04.260
left laughter cuisine.
Uh,

393
00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:08.140
it's just www.rescuingleftoverlosing.org/calendar.

394
00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:12.310
And there's basically a list of all the events that we have in,
in your region.

395
00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:16.140
And essentially,
um,
the,
uh,

396
00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:19.030
kind of events are listed,
events were,

397
00:24:19.031 --> 00:24:24.031
rescues are listed as in chronological order and in different locations within

398
00:24:25.391 --> 00:24:28.510
your region.
So for example,
in New York City,
uh,
there's like Fidei,

399
00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:31.000
there's midtown,
there's,
you know,
upper west side,
upper east side,

400
00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:33.910
and essentially people can filter down and looking at,

401
00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:37.550
look on a map view as well and figure out what time and uh,

402
00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:38.950
location they're available.

403
00:24:38.951 --> 00:24:43.951
And to help out these pickups are a volunteer opportunities that are really easy

404
00:24:44.651 --> 00:24:48.550
to kind of fit into your schedule because it's just 30 minutes of your time to

405
00:24:48.551 --> 00:24:49.384
an hour.

406
00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:53.500
So you can do it easily on her way to work on your way between classes or

407
00:24:53.501 --> 00:24:56.970
between,
you know,
Jim and other things or in places.
Yeah.
Uh,

408
00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:59.400
and you essentially can,
uh,

409
00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:03.580
help make direct impact because you're gonna actually see after you sign up,

410
00:25:03.581 --> 00:25:04.181
you'll get,
you know,

411
00:25:04.181 --> 00:25:07.810
automated confirmation emails and all this and you'll get the contact

412
00:25:07.811 --> 00:25:09.970
information of the person who's going to be leading your event.

413
00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:12.670
And once you meet with everyone,
um,

414
00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:16.830
you can actually see the actual food that's about to go to waste restaurants

415
00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:21.220
cleaning off.
You get to see the Lumen Vinton's or bags and things like that.

416
00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:26.620
And you can actually rescue that and walk it over.
Um,
sometimes,
you know,

417
00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:30.460
uh,
will be 15 minutes walking.
Sometimes it'll be five minutes of walking.

418
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:34.090
Sometimes it would be like,
you know,
a little bit more,
25 minutes of walking,

419
00:25:34.091 --> 00:25:38.290
but it'll be within that neighborhood,
same neighborhood.

420
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:42.280
And that's kind of what I love about the model is just local.
You know,

421
00:25:42.281 --> 00:25:45.460
it's just local restaurants helping local homeless shelters with local

422
00:25:45.461 --> 00:25:49.210
volunteers.
Um,
and that's it.
They drop it off,

423
00:25:49.211 --> 00:25:54.070
they get the receipt and they upload it online through the application and,
uh,

424
00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:57.760
and,
and that's it.
They made that impacted.
They help.
They can see the people,

425
00:25:57.761 --> 00:26:01.180
the line of people outside the homeless shelter that's going to be fed with that

426
00:26:01.181 --> 00:26:05.500
food.
So it's immediate.
It's sad.
Um,
you know,
impact that,

427
00:26:05.501 --> 00:26:10.060
that they get a c.
So,
uh,
for a volunteer it's typically super easy.

428
00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:13.330
Uh,
if people want to get even more involved,
it can be a lead rescue,

429
00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:17.590
which like yourself
and people can lead on a,

430
00:26:17.591 --> 00:26:22.060
on a weekly basis and actually help lead other volunteers,
uh,

431
00:26:22.061 --> 00:26:26.380
and kind of,
you know,
take them through the route,
um,
and,
and be,
you know,

432
00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:30.490
kind of responsible for that route.
Um,
so yeah,
there's,

433
00:26:30.491 --> 00:26:33.190
there's a lot of ways to kind of help out in nearby

434
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:36.880
<v 0>[inaudible].
Yeah.
I found,
you know,
I am a volunteer.</v>

435
00:26:36.881 --> 00:26:40.660
I volunteer every week with the organization and it's exactly what you said,

436
00:26:40.661 --> 00:26:45.240
it's just very,
very simple.
Um,
I,
you on volunteer match,

437
00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:48.330
which was,
you know,
which is where every,
you know,
volunteer opportunities,

438
00:26:48.331 --> 00:26:53.130
let's say.
And um,
you know,
I,
I just,
I couldn't believe it was,
it was that simple.

439
00:26:53.131 --> 00:26:57.810
And I think for people with busy schedules like all of us,
um,
it's,
it's,

440
00:26:57.811 --> 00:27:02.811
it really is perfect and it's also a great way to get exercise to bring your

441
00:27:02.971 --> 00:27:06.510
friends and do it.
Everyone's trying to,
you know,
knock,
say,
you know,

442
00:27:06.511 --> 00:27:09.350
save money and not go to the bar at night,
you know,
bring them to,
uh,

443
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:13.350
bring them to a shift.
Yeah.
And it truly is 30,

444
00:27:13.351 --> 00:27:17.280
30 minutes to an hour door to door to door.
Um,
but yeah,

445
00:27:17.281 --> 00:27:21.630
to bring the food in and to walking into a shelter and to see the people who are

446
00:27:21.631 --> 00:27:24.900
going to eat it right there is,
is,
it's just a wonderful,
it's,

447
00:27:24.901 --> 00:27:29.160
it's what I love about RLC with other organizations.
I,
I think there's a,

448
00:27:29.161 --> 00:27:32.370
you know,
long orientation process and,
um,
you know,

449
00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:35.670
a waitlist and this is just click,
sign up,

450
00:27:35.671 --> 00:27:39.930
show up and just kind of kind of do it.
Very,
very simple.
Yeah.

451
00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:41.220
Couldn't believe it was that simple.

452
00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:45.630
<v 2>Yeah.
We tried to make it easy because,
you know,
we,</v>

453
00:27:45.631 --> 00:27:49.860
we really need as many people to help with this problem because,

454
00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:54.880
um,
you know,
food waste is happening literally everywhere around us.
And,
uh,

455
00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:59.190
you know,
we're all agents of,
you know,
people were just moving all the time.

456
00:27:59.191 --> 00:28:02.940
And if we were moving with excess food and dropping off while we're going to

457
00:28:02.941 --> 00:28:05.490
places,
it would just make it so much easier.
We could,

458
00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:09.710
we could solve this problem.
So,
uh,
we didn't want that to be a barrier and a,

459
00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:13.830
we wanted to give the power to the people to basically make a difference in
this,

460
00:28:13.831 --> 00:28:16.710
in this problem.
Um,
but of course there is,
you know,

461
00:28:16.711 --> 00:28:19.710
the lead rescue is to make sure that people are not stealing the fruit and the

462
00:28:19.711 --> 00:28:24.540
fruit.
Yeah.
But,
but,
you know,
the lead rescuers are kind of,
you know,
the,

463
00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:28.340
the,
you know,
all the volunteers are kind of the crux of this model.
So.

464
00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:31.340
<v 0>And so,
um,
so you've expanded,</v>

465
00:28:31.341 --> 00:28:35.270
so you started in New York City and you've expanded to how many cities now?

466
00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:39.830
1616 cities around the u s correct.
How has,
how has that expansion and you know,

467
00:28:39.831 --> 00:28:40.664
what are the

468
00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:45.930
<v 2>siding?
I mean,
it's,
it's a lot of work.
Um,
you know,
it's,</v>

469
00:28:45.931 --> 00:28:47.420
it's exciting to see that,
you know,

470
00:28:47.421 --> 00:28:50.390
it's not just New York City because New York City is such a unique city.

471
00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:55.720
We were started here,
we're headquartered here,
but,
um,
it's,
uh,
yeah,

472
00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:57.830
it's very different in other branches.

473
00:28:57.890 --> 00:29:01.390
In New York City you can walk because there are homeless shelters and kitchens,

474
00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:06.230
like literally,
you know,
15 minutes,
20 minutes away on foot from places,

475
00:29:06.231 --> 00:29:09.370
but,
um,
and you'll never know him.
Um,
and,

476
00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:14.740
but in places like,
you know,
other cities,
any other city,
uh,

477
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:19.440
you'll have to drive.
And,
um,
we,
you know,
we,
we had to kind of figure out a,

478
00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:24.110
what's the right model to kind of tweets to tweet the technology a little bit to

479
00:29:24.111 --> 00:29:28.100
accommodate for that and things like that.
Um,
but it's working out really well.

480
00:29:28.101 --> 00:29:31.260
So,
um,
it's also very different in terms of,
you know,

481
00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:34.430
the types of food businesses that are outside of New York City.

482
00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:39.320
A lot of the pounds of food that we get are sometimes larger and,
um,

483
00:29:39.650 --> 00:29:39.951
but,

484
00:29:39.951 --> 00:29:44.951
but it's deciding w currently are working on a lot of the kind of lower end of

485
00:29:45.791 --> 00:29:48.940
the supply chain in terms of,
you know,
restaurants and,
you know,
um,

486
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.300
retail businesses.
But,
uh,
eventually,
you know,

487
00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:55.450
obviously the food waste problem is so complex that,
you know,

488
00:29:55.451 --> 00:29:57.700
we want to help out in any,
you know,

489
00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:01.090
with the same technology and the same system help out with any level of the

490
00:30:01.091 --> 00:30:05.590
supply chain,
wherever access food is happening.
So,
uh,
it's exciting,
but you know,

491
00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:08.740
obviously a lot of,
yeah,
a lot of things to kind of consider.

492
00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:11.440
<v 0>Great.
If anyone has any questions,</v>

493
00:30:11.441 --> 00:30:15.880
you can line up at the mics in the center or the Isles and um,

494
00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:20.380
I'll keep asking you questions.
Okay.
So,
um,
okay,
so,
so what,

495
00:30:20.381 --> 00:30:24.330
what can people do?
Of course they can volunteer,
um,
what,
you know,

496
00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:27.490
what other types of things do you need help with?

497
00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:31.450
I believe you got a grant last year.
Um,
you know,
what,

498
00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:32.920
what is your organization?

499
00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:36.430
<v 2>Yeah.
So,
so yeah,
last year from,
we actually got a grant from Google,</v>

500
00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:41.790
which was really amazing.
Uh,
and thanks again for that.
I mean,
um,

501
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:45.760
but you know,
it helped us develop our technology.
Uh,
and,
and at the crux of it,

502
00:30:45.761 --> 00:30:49.720
this is a technology driven a system.
Without steering analogy,

503
00:30:49.721 --> 00:30:52.750
we would have to have like five more staff members that are coordinating and

504
00:30:52.751 --> 00:30:57.520
sending emails and sending reminder emails and things like that.
Um,
but you know,

505
00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:00.700
with this technology we're able to kind of scale it up and be much more

506
00:31:00.701 --> 00:31:04.870
efficient.
So in terms of ways that people get help,
there's just,
there's so many,

507
00:31:04.871 --> 00:31:09.160
right?
I mean,
um,
uh,
on the most basic level,
like you can give time,

508
00:31:09.161 --> 00:31:13.690
you can give resources,
you can give,
um,
you know,
contacts and there's like that.

509
00:31:13.691 --> 00:31:16.030
So on,
on the time side,

510
00:31:16.031 --> 00:31:19.150
obviously you can sign up as a regular volunteer and sign up whenever you want,

511
00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:22.820
whenever you're available.
Um,
and on,
you know,

512
00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:24.660
if you want to invest even more time,

513
00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:26.640
it can be a lead rescue where you can be a core risky.

514
00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:29.020
We were doing 10 times a week,
you can be,
you know,

515
00:31:29.021 --> 00:31:31.060
you can help us out in the office and you know,

516
00:31:31.061 --> 00:31:35.470
with your skill sets and things like that.
Um,
and then on the resources side,

517
00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:35.891
you know,

518
00:31:35.891 --> 00:31:40.180
obviously we're a five one c three nonprofit organization and so we basically

519
00:31:40.181 --> 00:31:44.740
depend on,
uh,
you know,
monetary donation is to continue to grow and expand.

520
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:49.250
We do have a operations that allow us to kind of,
you know,

521
00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:54.130
organically grow in terms of,
uh,
having the operations covered by earned revenue.

522
00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:59.590
So any donations that people make are contributing directly to the growth,
uh,

523
00:31:59.591 --> 00:32:00.040
which is,

524
00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:04.030
which is really why we've been able to expand so quickly over the past few
years.

525
00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:05.830
Um,
so like for example,

526
00:32:05.831 --> 00:32:10.060
last year we doubled the year before that we couldn't top old.
Uh,
so,
you know,

527
00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:13.120
we were able to do this because we have,
you know,
the,

528
00:32:13.121 --> 00:32:18.040
the kind of model that we can continue to be able to be sustainable.
Um,

529
00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:22.230
and then on kind of the,
the contact side,
I mean,
we are a,

530
00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:26.860
an organization that works with a lot of different parties.
Um,
restaurants,

531
00:32:27.130 --> 00:32:30.280
catering companies,
a farms,
wholesalers,
retailers.

532
00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:32.950
There's so many different food businesses,

533
00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:36.910
food kind of a related organizations.
There's food waste everywhere.

534
00:32:36.911 --> 00:32:40.670
When it thinks the places that people don't even think about,
uh,
like stadiums,

535
00:32:40.671 --> 00:32:44.540
fashion shoots,
you know,
the photo shoots,
like it's just literally everywhere.

536
00:32:44.541 --> 00:32:47.750
It's not just the restaurants and things like that.
So,
um,

537
00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:52.780
contacts that people have to these people that we can basically,
you know,

538
00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:56.810
set up a relationship and make it really easy to donate their food is ideal.

539
00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:00.380
Um,
and,
and yeah,
and obviously on the homeless shelter side,

540
00:33:00.381 --> 00:33:03.980
if people have contacts to places where we can help,
you know,

541
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:08.210
partner with to distribute the fear,
um,
you know,
that's a huge help as well.

542
00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:12.680
So yeah,
lots of ways,
but I would say number one,

543
00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:17.510
just volunteer time,
go onto our website and sign up online and so fun.
Yeah,

544
00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:22.620
you can see the people.
Yeah,
yeah.
Great Way to meet people.
It really is.
Yeah.

545
00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:25.430
Yeah.
We have a question over here.
Hi.

546
00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:30.390
<v 3>So I think the word that you guys do is amazing and also it's in an area I don't</v>

547
00:33:30.391 --> 00:33:33.180
know that much about.
And so I learned a lot today.
Thank you.

548
00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:36.540
I kind of had a question around,
um,
you know,

549
00:33:36.541 --> 00:33:39.570
food insecurity is not a problem where,
you know,

550
00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:43.890
like medicine or something where like a person needs a one time treatment and

551
00:33:43.891 --> 00:33:46.860
then you fixed them.
It's,
you know,
you need food every single day.

552
00:33:46.861 --> 00:33:48.540
And so it is a structural problem.

553
00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:53.430
And I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of the stuff you

554
00:33:53.431 --> 00:33:54.300
mentioned earlier about like,

555
00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:58.800
do cities have programs where they do some food waste pickups and stuff for

556
00:33:58.801 --> 00:33:59.820
shelters and already,

557
00:33:59.821 --> 00:34:03.930
or is that an area where there's room for you to expand from the volunteer and

558
00:34:03.931 --> 00:34:06.420
nonprofit side to like policy advocacy at all?

559
00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:10.840
<v 2>Yeah,
that's a really good question.
Um,
there,</v>

560
00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:13.980
there's a bunch of different levels to that question,
but,
uh,

561
00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:16.290
in terms of what RLC is doing,
uh,

562
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:20.850
to kind of help with the food insecurity issue,
uh,
as I mentioned,

563
00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:24.820
food insecurity and poverty in general is a really complex issue and nutrition

564
00:34:24.821 --> 00:34:28.030
is just one piece of the problem.
Uh,
and,

565
00:34:28.031 --> 00:34:31.540
and food waste is going to help contribute to the overall solution to that

566
00:34:31.541 --> 00:34:34.670
problem.
And the way we see it is,
uh,

567
00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:38.830
the amount of money that we can save the homeless shelters from buying food.

568
00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:43.120
They can use that money to have much more longterm solutions like job skills,

569
00:34:43.121 --> 00:34:46.450
trainings,
shelter and basic needs and things like that.

570
00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:51.220
And we see ourselves as part of the solution to that problem.
So,

571
00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:54.190
um,
you know,
in terms of policy and things like that,

572
00:34:54.191 --> 00:34:57.910
we're really excited about kind of making sure that food rescue becomes more and

573
00:34:57.911 --> 00:35:02.620
more mainstream and hopefully even required in the future.
Maybe,
um,

574
00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:02.921
you know,

575
00:35:02.921 --> 00:35:06.310
similar to like what's France doing if France is doing and things like that.
But,

576
00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:10.690
uh,
it seems like that's a bit further away,
uh,

577
00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:14.920
especially with current events.
But,
um,
it,
it seems like,
you know,

578
00:35:14.921 --> 00:35:19.640
policy is something that's really important to do,
make this,
uh,
you know,
uh,

579
00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:24.380
a requirement that make this,
uh,
at least,
you know,
much more mainstream,
uh,

580
00:35:24.450 --> 00:35:28.370
across food business as a whole.
So,
uh,
hopefully that answers both parts.

581
00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:29.980
The question.
Hmm.
Cool.

582
00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:35.540
<v 3>Hey,
thank you for coming on today.
You're obviously,
you know,</v>

583
00:35:35.541 --> 00:35:37.980
you found it here in New York and based,
um,

584
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:40.170
<v 4>and you're talking about expanding to other cities and whatnot.</v>

585
00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:45.880
If somebody wanted to start this same kind of program in any other city and

586
00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:48.740
still like going to your same brand and be part of your organization and your

587
00:35:48.741 --> 00:35:51.090
resources,
like how would we do that?

588
00:35:51.091 --> 00:35:54.520
Do you have like franchising committees or things?
Basically

589
00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:59.390
<v 2>kind of like a franchising,
but it's like for like a nonprofit.
So,
um,</v>

590
00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:00.750
but it's the same type of process.

591
00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:05.790
We have a a badge application process that you go through a happy to,
um,

592
00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:09.310
kind of,
uh,
you know,
give out that information.
Uh,
the,

593
00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:14.340
the number one ways to go onto a website and contact us about the opportunity or

594
00:36:14.641 --> 00:36:16.380
email us at Info at rescuing.

595
00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:20.370
And leftover cuisine.org and essentially it's just a kind of,
um,

596
00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:24.730
to create a branch in any area,
you just need to kind of,
uh,

597
00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:28.830
have a certain number of,
uh,
you know,
people that are dedicated to the cause to,

598
00:36:28.831 --> 00:36:33.450
to grow the branch and things like that.
Uh,
but yes,
we require,
uh,
you know,

599
00:36:33.451 --> 00:36:38.110
the help from people that are local to understand the local environment,
um,

600
00:36:38.111 --> 00:36:41.010
with and do the research of what exists and what's working,

601
00:36:41.011 --> 00:36:42.840
what's not working in that specific area.

602
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:46.410
Because the worst thing that we can do is duplicate kind of effort that's

603
00:36:46.411 --> 00:36:48.480
already happening.
Uh,
and,
and we,

604
00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:51.270
we did a ton of research in the beginning to make sure that we weren't

605
00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:55.380
duplicating efforts and we were targeting that niche market.
Um,
and so we would,

606
00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:57.720
we would basically figuring out that together.

607
00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:01.450
<v 0>Um,
I'm curious,
you know,</v>

608
00:37:01.451 --> 00:37:04.840
you mentioned that what sets you apart from others is that you have this,
this,

609
00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:09.650
this,
um,
technology component.
Um,
if you had,

610
00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:14.120
is there a bigger goal for the technology of,
of,
you know what,
yeah,

611
00:37:15.010 --> 00:37:18.230
what does that,
what does that look like?
Yeah.
There's so much we can do.
I mean,

612
00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:20.230
um,
currently it's 11

613
00:37:20.350 --> 00:37:24.790
<v 2>vocation code in Ruby on rails and we're trying to let kind of push towards a</v>

614
00:37:24.791 --> 00:37:28.930
progressive web application,
which I think actually is a Google thing.
Um,
but,

615
00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:34.120
um,
what we would love to do is make this a more kind of mobile app type of

616
00:37:34.121 --> 00:37:38.500
situation that it uses location settings that uses a push notifications and

617
00:37:38.501 --> 00:37:41.580
things like that right now are you relying on texts and emails and things like

618
00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:46.100
that,
but push notifications and location settings would be huge because,
uh,

619
00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:49.660
as we scale,
as we have more and more restaurants and pickups that kind of,

620
00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:50.770
you know,
randomly,

621
00:37:50.771 --> 00:37:55.120
logistically in terms of a sheer number of volunteers and sheer number of

622
00:37:55.121 --> 00:37:56.140
pickups that are happening,

623
00:37:56.141 --> 00:38:00.430
there are going to be more opportunities of people kind of calling out or um,

624
00:38:00.490 --> 00:38:03.310
you know,
not going to be able to make them advent and things like that.

625
00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:06.670
And if we had the bobble capability to basically say,
hey,

626
00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:08.830
you're in the area and you know,

627
00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:12.520
have a push notification that goes in and ask those people to basically cover

628
00:38:12.521 --> 00:38:17.020
that event,
that would basically like,
they'll be a huge game changer.
Um,

629
00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:21.010
and,
uh,
you know,
there's,
there's so many other things we want to do with,
uh,

630
00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:25.540
with those kinds of,
where the technology out there.
There's also,
um,
you know,

631
00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:28.690
the whole transportation industry right now,

632
00:38:28.691 --> 00:38:33.691
it's kind of going through the automated kind of transportation system going on.

633
00:38:34.001 --> 00:38:37.110
And one of the things that want to,
and we're excited about,
uh,

634
00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:42.420
trying to pilot is figuring out how that kind of automated drivers situation or

635
00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:47.650
drones situation can be applied to food rescue because it totally can and could

636
00:38:47.651 --> 00:38:52.651
be a great solution to applying technology to a age old to age old issues.

637
00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:57.850
Um,
so yeah,
there's so much exciting things.
Yeah.
There,

638
00:38:58.140 --> 00:38:59.890
there's a great potential there.

639
00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:05.220
<v 0>So,
so in a perfect world,
no food is wasted.
Yeah.
What happens to RLC?</v>

640
00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:07.420
Well,
that's,
see,
that's it.
That's the thing

641
00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:10.610
<v 2>because,
um,
you know,
I've always struggled with that.</v>

642
00:39:10.611 --> 00:39:13.640
I think it's also because of my background as a,
you know,

643
00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:15.950
working at JP Morgan and for profit.

644
00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:20.000
I think when I kind of went into the nonprofit space,
it was,

645
00:39:20.001 --> 00:39:22.760
it was difficult to kind of have the right KPI.

646
00:39:22.761 --> 00:39:25.310
And I mentioned that kind of number of partners was most important.

647
00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:30.110
And one of the reasons why we consciously decided to go with a volunteer driven

648
00:39:30.111 --> 00:39:33.740
model was so that we can scale up and down as needed.
If,

649
00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:38.280
if the restaurant starts out 120 pounds,
we can have,
you know,

650
00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:40.420
10 volunteers carrying 10 pounds,
12 pounds each.

651
00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:44.660
But then if it goes down to 40 pounds and they're able to reduce it on,
on,

652
00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:48.570
on site,
then we can just bring four pounds,
four volunteers.
Um,

653
00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:53.500
and so the way we see it is we basically can use,
well,

654
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:57.560
whatever we have at our disposal in terms of volunteers to accommodate whatever

655
00:39:57.561 --> 00:40:01.400
the cap is,
the capacity is required.
Uh,
but we're not reliant on it.

656
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:05.130
We're not looking to have a lot of pounds of food so that we can pair employees

657
00:40:05.131 --> 00:40:05.511
that can,
you know,

658
00:40:05.511 --> 00:40:10.310
like we want to be able to kind of remain nimble and kind of actually solve the

659
00:40:10.311 --> 00:40:14.820
problem rather than kind of perpetuating,
right.
Yeah.
So,

660
00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:16.260
yeah.

661
00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:17.400
<v 0>Any other questions?
All right.</v>

662
00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:21.090
Well if you have one call to action or one thing you'd like to leave with and

663
00:40:21.091 --> 00:40:23.790
also if you could remind everyone of the website.
Yes.
Yeah,

664
00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:25.110
<v 2>that's of course.
So yeah,</v>

665
00:40:25.111 --> 00:40:28.610
with the number one thing is going onto a website I rescuing leftover

666
00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:33.360
cuisine.org/calendar and signing up for your first pickup.
Yeah.
Yeah.

667
00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:36.060
It's a really great way to kind of check us out.
Uh,

668
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:40.080
go on to the Lurie and figure out,
oh,
day three day,
all day,
every day,

669
00:40:40.081 --> 00:40:41.640
seven days a week.
Um,

670
00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:45.450
the video said I think 10 to midnight and now we do a pretty much like 8:00 AM

671
00:40:45.451 --> 00:40:47.910
to like 2:00 AM so,
uh,
no excuse.

672
00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:52.000
<v 0>No.
But,
but yeah,
it's really,
it's really</v>

673
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.270
<v 2>great.
It's a really great way to how Robert,
thank you for coming.</v>

674
00:40:55.271 --> 00:40:56.750
Thank you so much for that.
Okay.
Awesome.
