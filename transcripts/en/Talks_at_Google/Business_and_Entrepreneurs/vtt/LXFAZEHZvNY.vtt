1
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.150
Thank you guys for coming out today.
My name is Scott Bergman.

2
00:00:08.151 --> 00:00:11.780
I'm part of the talks that Google program here in Ann Arbor and I have the

3
00:00:11.781 --> 00:00:13.910
distinct privilege of welcoming doctors.

4
00:00:13.911 --> 00:00:17.570
Jeff and Stan need to graph a to tell you guys a little bit about them.

5
00:00:17.571 --> 00:00:20.420
I'll give you a little background.
Uh,
at 25,

6
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.840
Dr Jeff digraph became a senior executive at Domino's,

7
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.800
which became one of the fastest growing companies in America.
And not only that,

8
00:00:27.801 --> 00:00:31.490
he became a professor at the Ross School of business here in Ann Arbor and has

9
00:00:31.491 --> 00:00:35.990
become a SeeSuite advisor to over half of the fortune 500.
Not only that,

10
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.770
Jeff's ideas and innovation had been covered by the NPR and PBS where he has

11
00:00:39.771 --> 00:00:44.120
been a featured columnist for inc wired fortunate in psychology today just to

12
00:00:44.121 --> 00:00:44.954
name a few.

13
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.910
And we have staff need to graph here today who is the CEO of innovator eum a

14
00:00:49.911 --> 00:00:51.560
consulting and training practice here.

15
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.660
And they also have offices in Atlanta and Ann Arbor.

16
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.650
And she's also an innovation community builder where she runs innovation

17
00:00:57.651 --> 00:01:01.340
tournament's here in Detroit and is also the creator of the collaborative open

18
00:01:01.341 --> 00:01:05.360
innovation network used by the University of Michigan.
All right guys,

19
00:01:05.361 --> 00:01:08.230
well come on up.
We're happy to have you.
Thank you.

20
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.890
Thank you guys for joining us today.

21
00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.010
<v 0>Thanks Google.
Thanks for having us.
Thanks Scott.</v>

22
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.100
So what I want to do today is I want to challenge a lot of,
uh,

23
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.910
probably your most sacred notions about innovation.

24
00:01:18.911 --> 00:01:22.560
I'm going to tell you a little bit about my work and,
and,
uh,

25
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.040
what we know about how innovation actually produces value and destroys value.
Uh,

26
00:01:27.041 --> 00:01:27.701
to do that,

27
00:01:27.701 --> 00:01:30.370
it's going to be like an old western movie where we're going to start with the

28
00:01:30.371 --> 00:01:33.280
long shot,
you know,
of,
of the city of dodge,

29
00:01:33.281 --> 00:01:35.470
and then we're going to move into the tumbleweeds street.

30
00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.800
Then finally we're going to look at,
uh,
the sheriff,
right?
We're gonna,

31
00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.660
we're gonna talk about you.
So I want to start with a little backstory here.
Um,

32
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:44.230
I'm all,

33
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.140
both standing and I are technologists were trained as technologists that sort of

34
00:01:47.141 --> 00:01:50.230
advanced degrees are in.
Um,
but interestingly enough,

35
00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.890
whenever I'm a anywhere in an airport and I travel a lot,

36
00:01:53.891 --> 00:01:56.110
somebody always wants to stop and tell me about new technology.

37
00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.350
They have you heard about the latest thing,

38
00:01:58.351 --> 00:02:02.290
and I'm sure you guys get this all the time and it's,
some of it's apocryphal,

39
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.520
you know,
that we're being,

40
00:02:03.521 --> 00:02:06.930
it's I technologies coming from aliens and some of it's,
uh,

41
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.970
some of it's stuff that you've already seen your,
you're already know,
but,

42
00:02:09.971 --> 00:02:13.360
but you all know that technology happens and the cycle of technology,

43
00:02:13.361 --> 00:02:16.840
the magnitude will men of technology always increases over time.

44
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.950
And there's a bunch of laws about this.
I won't bore you with that.
But around,
uh,

45
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.420
around the late eighties,

46
00:02:22.421 --> 00:02:27.421
I got a call from an editor at life magazine and she wanted to talk to me about

47
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.330
innovation.
So I thought she wanted to talk to me and she said,
no,

48
00:02:31.331 --> 00:02:32.860
I want you to give a commentary.

49
00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:37.030
We're writing a piece on the hundred most important people of the 20th century,

50
00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.250
and one of them is related to you.
Now this was a huge surprise.
I don't know any,

51
00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.220
most of the people related to me not doing so well.
Right.

52
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.500
So there she talked about this man named Charles Fair to graph and she sort of,

53
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.640
you know,
I was embarrassed.
I didn't know who this person was.
A No,
you know,

54
00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:58.990
nobody told me about.
So when she got off the phone,
I looked him up and he,

55
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.890
the guy who created pocket books,
he created paperback books in the 1930s.

56
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.250
And his whole idea with this technology was that people would become literate if

57
00:03:08.411 --> 00:03:12.310
books were cheap,
two bits people would become literate,
but they didn't.

58
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.750
And the reason it stuck with me,

59
00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:18.580
I was doing a project with Alan Kay and Steve Jobs in the state of California to

60
00:03:18.581 --> 00:03:22.840
try and develop literacy for people who are,
who are,
uh,
underserved.

61
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.850
And we the exact same result.

62
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.230
We didn't get any results from introducing technology into the situation.

63
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.650
And so very early on that began to galvanize my thoughts about culture and the

64
00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:37.360
role of culture and technology and how in some ways,

65
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.060
culture overtakes or co ops technology.

66
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.530
So what I want to talk about today is that innovation isn't really an invention.

67
00:03:44.531 --> 00:03:47.740
It's not just a gadget.
It's not,
you know,
it's not next.
The cool thing,

68
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.490
it actually has a lot to do with identifying patterns,

69
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.200
how those patterns go together,

70
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.440
identifying how culture and compency interact with those patterns.

71
00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.330
And I want to give some examples of that,

72
00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.780
but I want to start with this whole notion of dominant logic and it's a really

73
00:04:01.781 --> 00:04:05.860
big thing for Google and you're getting a lot of sort of press negative press

74
00:04:05.861 --> 00:04:09.730
about this and that is one of the things that goes on in our world.

75
00:04:09.731 --> 00:04:13.450
We sometimes call it this in business microsegmentation the notion is we have a

76
00:04:13.451 --> 00:04:16.990
tendency to identify in value people who are like us,
right?

77
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:20.470
That's kind of one of the big challenges and when social media started,

78
00:04:20.471 --> 00:04:24.070
I started writing articles that got a lot of negative attention saying that I

79
00:04:24.071 --> 00:04:28.030
wasn't sure that social media was really a creating this kind of inclusive

80
00:04:28.031 --> 00:04:30.700
society that in some ways it was micro segmenting us.

81
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.590
The people who are your friends,

82
00:04:32.591 --> 00:04:35.020
even though they might look different and they may seem different,

83
00:04:35.021 --> 00:04:37.600
they actually believe all the same nonsense you believe.

84
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.100
And if they don't believe it,
what do you do?
You on a dark night,
on a dark road,

85
00:04:42.101 --> 00:04:45.070
you unfriend them.
The Spanish inquisition couldn't have thought of this.

86
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.250
So the notion is we get these very vertical segments.

87
00:04:48.251 --> 00:04:50.800
So if you've ever talked to anybody about religion or politics,

88
00:04:50.801 --> 00:04:53.170
you know what I mean by the whole notion of dominant logic.

89
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.680
And it comes back to what they crazy philosopher Schopenhauer said,
uh,
you know,

90
00:04:56.681 --> 00:04:58.570
over a century ago,
every man,

91
00:04:58.571 --> 00:05:02.470
every person takes the limits of his own field division for the limits of the

92
00:05:02.471 --> 00:05:04.300
world.
And that's kind of where we're at.
Now.

93
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.910
I'm going to make the argument that this is the problem of modernity and there's

94
00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.550
a way to solve this,
to get over this.

95
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.640
So the key is how do we get beyond this dominant logic?

96
00:05:12.641 --> 00:05:16.330
How do we develop a mindset to actually be more inclusive?

97
00:05:16.331 --> 00:05:19.000
And I'm going to talk about inclusiveness in a way that's very different than

98
00:05:19.001 --> 00:05:21.880
you've probably heard it because it's not just politically correct.

99
00:05:21.881 --> 00:05:24.310
It's not just morally correct.
It's essential for innovation.

100
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.960
I'm going to prove it to you now.

101
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.620
It turns out that every organization has to do two things,
and boy,
Google,

102
00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:30.970
this is really relevant to you.

103
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.450
The first thing an organization has to do is maintain itself.
It has to.

104
00:05:34.451 --> 00:05:37.690
Pr had asked to produce predictable outcomes.

105
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.920
This is why capitalism requires capitalists.
Whether you're a private equity,

106
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.210
whether it's publicly traded,

107
00:05:43.211 --> 00:05:45.780
somebody asked to show that you're going to do things on a normal basis.

108
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.560
In the way that that happens is we get rid of variants.
We create standards.

109
00:05:50.561 --> 00:05:53.930
We call this operating rhythm.
Right now,
the notion is that makes us,

110
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.980
that makes us all predictable,
but the problem is just like people,

111
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.510
we want to grow,
so to grow,
instead of eliminating deviants,

112
00:06:02.511 --> 00:06:04.910
what we need to do is introduce it.

113
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.420
So innovation by definition is a form of deviants.

114
00:06:08.421 --> 00:06:12.620
And so we're going to have this tension and it's not a tension of type.

115
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.610
It's not I'm an ENTP or an inf Jay.
It's not that.

116
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:21.110
It's one form of value actually literally assaults.

117
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.690
The other one form of value destroys the other.

118
00:06:23.691 --> 00:06:26.990
I want you to think about high growth economies versus high quality or

119
00:06:26.991 --> 00:06:28.130
productive economies.

120
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.090
They're oppositional and there's a reason one is creating standards and one is

121
00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:33.080
creating deviance.

122
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:36.140
Now I'm going to say something that's going to seem very radical to you.

123
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:41.440
This tension when used properly is actually not only good,

124
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.610
it's the basis of the growth engine.

125
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.560
So let me give you some examples of culture and how culture co-op's technology.

126
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.820
Interestingly enough,

127
00:06:49.821 --> 00:06:53.000
everybody talks about Tesla and it's a great technology and I love Tesla,

128
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:54.140
but here's the problem.

129
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.550
Tesla last year sold 55,000 cars and they lost $600 million.

130
00:06:58.551 --> 00:07:01.280
Now they're not going to lose $600 million going forward and they're going to

131
00:07:01.281 --> 00:07:03.050
sell maybe twice as many cars,

132
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.470
but the notion is we've had some soft quarters in the automobile industry,

133
00:07:06.471 --> 00:07:10.610
haven't we?
Tesla hasn't destroyed the automobile industry,
right?

134
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.000
What's affecting the automobile industry is over.
Now.

135
00:07:14.001 --> 00:07:15.230
I want you to think about it over for a minute.

136
00:07:15.231 --> 00:07:18.140
Where's the Innovation Uber ride sharing?
I'm an old guy.

137
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.200
We had ride sharing when I was a kid.
You called the parish priest.

138
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:25.010
You called the coach,
got a ride.
Look at the APP that they use.

139
00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:28.310
Doesn't it look like the 2007 over the road trucking app?

140
00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.050
It's not a particularly well run company.

141
00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:33.770
There's all kinds of legal problems with it.
Where's the innovation and Uber?

142
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:39.170
Young people like you will get in the car with a stranger,
right?

143
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:43.580
It's a social innovation.
I won't.
It's like airbnb.

144
00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:46.280
All of the sudden the car is not just something you drive.

145
00:07:46.281 --> 00:07:49.950
It's something you take someone in Airbnb.
If someone came to my house,
I,

146
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.670
I have a nice house on the Huron River and use my towel.

147
00:07:52.671 --> 00:07:56.120
I take it in the backyard,
burn it and buried.
I'd sick as dogs on them.
Right?

148
00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:00.140
The notion is this social form of innovation has co-opted this.

149
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:03.980
Same is true for Goldman Sachs.
Anybody remember about four years ago,

150
00:08:03.981 --> 00:08:05.150
not even for three years ago,

151
00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:08.570
the number one selling book on the New York Times nonfiction book was
nonfiction.

152
00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:11.780
List was a book called Flash Boys by Michael Lewis.
It was about spread networks.

153
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.420
The notion was Goldman Sachs and credit Suisse,

154
00:08:14.421 --> 00:08:17.060
we're trading a little faster than you or could trade,

155
00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:20.990
so they got the uplift on a stock and they got to sell,
get rid of the stock.

156
00:08:20.991 --> 00:08:23.090
They've got to short the stock is it started to go down.

157
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:24.290
Now think of it this way,
there.

158
00:08:24.291 --> 00:08:27.560
The bookie doesn't matter where they're Michigan or Ohio state,
when's the book?

159
00:08:27.561 --> 00:08:31.370
He always makes money.
That's what this deal was and everyone said the fix is in.

160
00:08:31.371 --> 00:08:34.780
The 1% is going to get richer and richer until what started happening until

161
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:38.540
cryptocurrency started to come in and that's what you young people right now.

162
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:41.930
Where do cryptocurrency start and don't say the 98 paper.

163
00:08:41.931 --> 00:08:46.100
That's not where it started.
Where it really started was in money laundering.

164
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:49.600
It started with drug cartels.
Where does streaming really started?

165
00:08:49.601 --> 00:08:52.640
I mean an earnest.
Where did that new technology come from?
The porn industry,

166
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.500
right?
Where did EMOJI started?
It started in terrorist cells.

167
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.850
So one of the things I want to point out right off the bat is that technologies

168
00:08:59.851 --> 00:09:03.690
are often used,
are first adapted by groups that they're not intended for.

169
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:06.780
Anybody.
See the problem that happened in Amazon right before Christmas,

170
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.250
there's a little recommendation engine,

171
00:09:08.251 --> 00:09:11.190
the little problem that showed up in the New York Times.
If you like fertilizer,

172
00:09:11.191 --> 00:09:13.260
you might like black powder and ball bearings,
right?

173
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:16.380
The notion is technology is powerful.

174
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:20.640
When we start looking at people who are making the smartphone's going back a

175
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.670
decade,
it's only been a decade.
The in their wildest dreams,

176
00:09:23.671 --> 00:09:27.210
they never imagined that you would use the camera to take pictures of yourself.

177
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:30.330
They thought you'd be at Yellowstone and taking the vistas and things like that.

178
00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:35.130
So culture has this mitigating factor where what you want technology to do is

179
00:09:35.131 --> 00:09:36.120
completely different.

180
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.990
And think about the 13 indictments two weeks ago that Mueller has made.

181
00:09:39.991 --> 00:09:43.650
So the notion is this culture piece is not only confounding,

182
00:09:43.651 --> 00:09:45.150
it actually does something more powerful.

183
00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:48.210
And the biggest industry to look at for this right now is pharmaceuticals.

184
00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.420
The pharmaceutical industry is reeling.
Why is it really,

185
00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:55.560
because all of these big pharmaceutical companies are all of the sudden having

186
00:09:55.561 --> 00:09:59.430
to compete with young people like yourself who've got together in a federation

187
00:09:59.431 --> 00:10:04.431
deal and they have names like bios forum and the open and firestorm and things

188
00:10:04.471 --> 00:10:04.771
like that.

189
00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:09.771
And what they're doing is to developing medications and therapies and drugs and

190
00:10:10.231 --> 00:10:14.520
their open source of patenting them.
Right?
So the notion is,
here's the question,

191
00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:17.670
I was at Duke the other day and I was talking to them to their law school and I

192
00:10:17.671 --> 00:10:19.350
said,
where are all your lawyers going these days?

193
00:10:19.351 --> 00:10:22.620
Cause it's tough to get a job if you're a lawyer.
And they said pharmaceuticals.

194
00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:25.050
Well the answer is simple.
What are they doing in pharmaceuticals?

195
00:10:25.051 --> 00:10:26.580
They're trying to protect their intellectual property.

196
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.760
Here becomes the question for you.
Who's going to win this bar fight?

197
00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:33.960
Is it going to be the millions of people who are trying to do things for free in

198
00:10:33.961 --> 00:10:34.840
this open source?

199
00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:38.220
Or is it going to be a handful of sort of these very monopolistic kind of

200
00:10:38.221 --> 00:10:40.290
companies that are trying to protect the intellectual property.

201
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:44.370
That's why we're seeing these companies start in places that don't have strong

202
00:10:44.371 --> 00:10:47.640
intellectual property laws,
Tanzania,
places like that,
parts of the Philippines,

203
00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:51.900
Sabu other kinds of places.
So I want to take a step back.

204
00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:53.580
So there's this big trend,

205
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:57.090
this trend towards technology coming out of places and people doing different

206
00:10:57.091 --> 00:10:58.170
things with it because of culture.

207
00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:02.610
And then this other big trend of the challenge between organizations trying to

208
00:11:02.611 --> 00:11:04.490
control things.
We're going to call this,
uh,

209
00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:08.510
we're going to call this a longitude and organization's network and we're going

210
00:11:08.511 --> 00:11:12.660
to call this latitude,
right?
Longitude and latitude of organizations.
Well,

211
00:11:12.661 --> 00:11:16.770
how does innovation actually relate to all this?
This has to start with,

212
00:11:16.771 --> 00:11:20.760
what's our definition about 1993 I got to write the definition for the federal

213
00:11:20.761 --> 00:11:21.900
government for innovation.

214
00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:27.260
And all I did was coopt a very famous definition from innovation from the 1960s

215
00:11:27.511 --> 00:11:31.740
from Marshall Mcluhan.
Mcluhan said innovation has four attributes.
He said,

216
00:11:31.741 --> 00:11:35.130
first of all,
and innovation enhances something.
Well here we are.
Google.

217
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:39.840
Were you the first search engine?
No.
What did you,
you know,

218
00:11:39.841 --> 00:11:43.660
did you have the same sort of format as other search engines know you had little

219
00:11:43.661 --> 00:11:46.590
box and what Google made better was not so much.

220
00:11:46.591 --> 00:11:48.990
It was a faster search or a better search.
At the beginning.

221
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.680
It was an easier search.
It was a simpler search,
right?

222
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.790
So you made it better by simplifying it.

223
00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:58.060
Now the second thing is an innovation has to eliminate something.

224
00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:02.440
What is the innovation kill?
Now,
that's a tough one,
right?

225
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:05.290
I want you to think about what it,
Charles Schwab killed.
Everybody.

226
00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:06.550
Remember brokerage houses,

227
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:09.910
the big brokerage houses in on fifth avenue down on Wall Street.

228
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:14.440
They're all gone.
Now the EF Hutton,
the quiet companies really quiet.
Why?

229
00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:19.030
Because we disintermediated the broker.
Basically.
We let trading happen directly.

230
00:12:19.031 --> 00:12:21.460
Course.
This is an industry.
You have a lot of interest in.
A lot of,
uh,

231
00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:25.120
a lot of stakes in the ground here.
It has to return us to something.

232
00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:30.160
Here's an interesting one.
It has to make us feel like we're like,
we're,

233
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:34.090
do we need to do something here?
We're okay.
All right.

234
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:38.380
So it has to make us feel like we're returning to something.

235
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.840
So think about it.
What are the big trends in restaurants right now?

236
00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:44.980
Is it faster food or is it slow food?
Whole food.

237
00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.830
Farm to table,
right?
And the ultimate,

238
00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:51.820
the ultimate returning us to something we feel we lost was developed about two

239
00:12:51.821 --> 00:12:56.740
blocks that direction,
which was Viagara right there.
25 again.
And finally,

240
00:12:56.741 --> 00:13:00.490
the most important thing McLuhan said,
and I've got your little logo up here,

241
00:13:00.491 --> 00:13:03.940
right?
The most important thing called McLuhan said he's just said over time and

242
00:13:03.941 --> 00:13:07.750
innovation reverses into its opposite the anti innovation.

243
00:13:07.751 --> 00:13:11.170
Does anybody remember when,
when email was going to set you free?

244
00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:14.590
Anybody remember that?
Yeah.
And now what?
We're all slaves,
right?

245
00:13:14.591 --> 00:13:17.560
We can't put her phone down.
We're all slaves to email and,
and,
and,

246
00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:20.950
and a SMS and everything else.
Now I'm going to add a few things to McCullough.

247
00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:24.790
Number one,
innovation is a form of useful novelty.

248
00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:28.570
All that means is it can happen anywhere.
Innovation can happen anywhere.

249
00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:31.600
So I want you to think about Starbucks for a minute.
It's a commodity.

250
00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:35.950
The Egyptians had it.
It's something that's been around for 3000 years.
Where's,

251
00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.680
where's the innovation?
And Starbucks will,
it's theater,
right?

252
00:13:38.681 --> 00:13:40.810
It's the whole experience of going to Starbucks and they have names for

253
00:13:40.811 --> 00:13:43.270
everything.
Innovation pays in the future.

254
00:13:43.271 --> 00:13:45.010
It's what's called a convex form of value.

255
00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:49.000
How much data do we have in the future?
Anyone?
How much data?

256
00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.780
So I'm coming home from Shanghai the other day and this guy sitting next to me

257
00:13:52.781 --> 00:13:57.100
says,
the dollar,
is it going up or down?
I said,
it's going down.
He said,

258
00:13:57.101 --> 00:13:59.800
why do you say that?
And I said,
because it's up.
That's a currencies.

259
00:13:59.801 --> 00:14:03.010
Do they go up and down?
Duh.
And he said,
what?

260
00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:07.930
He said when and I said,
I don't know it.
If I knew when I'd be George Soros,

261
00:14:07.931 --> 00:14:09.310
I'd be speculating the dollar.

262
00:14:09.311 --> 00:14:12.370
And I sure wouldn't be telling a pathetic loser like you about the dollar.

263
00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.250
So the point is,

264
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:19.000
the biggest form of resistance to innovation is excessive planning or getting

265
00:14:19.001 --> 00:14:22.150
stuck in the planning cycle.
Have you been to the meeting about the meeting?

266
00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:26.950
Have you seen the report about the report?
Yeah.
You're the big guys now.

267
00:14:26.951 --> 00:14:28.630
You used to be the small guys,
right?

268
00:14:28.631 --> 00:14:31.060
So someone else is running an experiment right now where you're doing that.

269
00:14:31.061 --> 00:14:34.510
And finally,
innovations have a shelf life.
They go sour like milk.

270
00:14:34.511 --> 00:14:36.130
So the other day I'm in Chicago,

271
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:38.860
I'm giving the keynote speech for the American Medical Association.

272
00:14:38.861 --> 00:14:41.500
I'm feeling pretty good about this.
It's a big,
it's a big meeting,

273
00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:45.190
but I notice on Michigan Avenue,
the line goes all the way down Michigan Avenue.

274
00:14:45.191 --> 00:14:48.520
And I'm thinking,
Holy Mackerel,
there's a lot of people here,
here.

275
00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:52.910
My silly talk about innovation.
And then it occurs to me what's being released.

276
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:57.470
The new apple iPhone is being released and they're basically in line to get the

277
00:14:57.471 --> 00:15:00.470
new iPhone.
Of course,
what happens to the old iPhone?

278
00:15:00.471 --> 00:15:05.150
The minute the new iPhone is introduced,
it's rubbish,
right?
It's discounted.

279
00:15:05.151 --> 00:15:06.830
It's falls off the commodity cycle.

280
00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:10.550
So the big challenge of innovation is it's only an innovation for a moment in

281
00:15:10.551 --> 00:15:12.350
time.
So this is what an innovation is,

282
00:15:12.351 --> 00:15:15.530
which means it can happen in the supply chain,
can happen in marketing,

283
00:15:15.531 --> 00:15:18.380
can happen.
The product itself.
It's a lot more than the gadget.

284
00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:21.350
So there's other mythologies I think that people have about innovation.

285
00:15:21.351 --> 00:15:25.160
I wanted to spell your first of all innovative organizations have very little in

286
00:15:25.161 --> 00:15:29.420
common.
When we start looking at the indexes for innovations,
and there's about,

287
00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:33.260
there's about seven that started and there's about 13 legitimate ones.

288
00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.230
Now there's hundreds of other ones,
but let's say on a 13 ones,

289
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:38.960
there's about 15% of the companies that they have in common,

290
00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.380
which tells you right off the bat that they're not talking about the same thing

291
00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:46.160
too.
Money is almost never a barrier to innovation.
Now,
if you know this,

292
00:15:46.161 --> 00:15:50.810
one of the big issues is money often creates a constraint when you have less

293
00:15:50.811 --> 00:15:52.490
money that you have to have an interesting work around.

294
00:15:52.491 --> 00:15:55.970
And we can talk about how the economy is flushed with money right now because

295
00:15:55.971 --> 00:15:59.750
the tax cut and all the repatriation of the money is going to put about a

296
00:15:59.751 --> 00:16:03.200
trillion,
maybe $2 trillion back in this economy.
So the notion is,

297
00:16:03.201 --> 00:16:06.410
is this really going to go to innovation?
Is it going to go to stock,
buy back it?

298
00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:09.140
Is it going to go to private equity?
Where's the money going to go?

299
00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:13.040
Competitors often compete in opposite ways.
So this is one that relates to you.

300
00:16:13.041 --> 00:16:16.490
Google,
you have how many companies now?
58 59 companies,
right?

301
00:16:16.491 --> 00:16:21.260
You make everything.
You are open source man,
right?
Apple.
What apple makes,

302
00:16:21.261 --> 00:16:23.630
what?
They make nothing,
right?

303
00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:27.710
Foxconn and invitation and a consortium of companies make Apple's product.

304
00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:31.970
They make design and they make brilliant designs.
You have to give that to apple.

305
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:35.430
And the other thing that makes,
they make a closed operating system,
right?
The,

306
00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:39.020
in their ecosystem,
it's not just different than yours,
it's almost oppositional,

307
00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:42.290
right?
One's playing offense,
one's playing defense.
So,

308
00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:46.070
so the whole idea that people,
even in the same kind of in a venn diagram,

309
00:16:46.071 --> 00:16:48.620
you not in the exact same industry but in related industries compete the same

310
00:16:48.621 --> 00:16:51.020
way.
They don't.
Incumbents are almost never first movers.

311
00:16:51.021 --> 00:16:54.470
This is what you have to worry about Google,
right?
Think about it as a bar fight.

312
00:16:54.471 --> 00:16:57.710
Anybody from a blue collar neighborhood like I am anybody from a blue car,
Nigga,

313
00:16:57.711 --> 00:16:59.240
you're from the same neighborhood I am.
Right?

314
00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:03.200
The notion is who throws a is a big guy with the Budweiser jacket or is it the

315
00:17:03.201 --> 00:17:06.020
little guy with crazy eyes is the little guy.

316
00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:10.340
We called this in business first mover advantage and this is why startups throw

317
00:17:10.341 --> 00:17:13.190
the first punch because they can't compete on scope or scale.

318
00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.920
So when I start looking at what's happened with Google,

319
00:17:15.921 --> 00:17:18.440
I think your cap value this morning,
he's like $680 billion.

320
00:17:18.441 --> 00:17:21.110
I think you're the second or third most valuable company in the world.

321
00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.740
You're no longer a startup and the real challenge here is what getting you to

322
00:17:24.741 --> 00:17:27.920
act like you're a startup.
I looked at your new building,
your beautiful building.

323
00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:30.590
I see all the trappings.
Remember I built dominoes.

324
00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:34.010
I help build Domino's in the 1980s which was the fastest growing company in the

325
00:17:34.011 --> 00:17:37.880
world in the 1980s the interesting thing is at some point you're going to have

326
00:17:37.881 --> 00:17:39.830
that real challenge of maintenance versus growth.

327
00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:43.130
It turns out that breakthrough happens at the edges of the bell curve.

328
00:17:43.131 --> 00:17:46.370
We'll talk about that later because that's a very important point and this is a

329
00:17:46.371 --> 00:17:48.020
point that stand he's going to talk about,

330
00:17:48.021 --> 00:17:53.021
which is when we started looking at innovation index is in 1993 less than 1% of

331
00:17:53.401 --> 00:17:56.460
them on a regular basis beat the growth benchmark on Wall Street.

332
00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:00.360
So the notion is most of what you believe about innovation is untrue.

333
00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:02.100
And we're going to talk about why it's untrue.

334
00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:05.460
There's only one thing that we're pretty sure we know about innovation and this

335
00:18:05.461 --> 00:18:07.050
is going to be the key to the whole discussion today.

336
00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:11.820
And that is diversity happens in the 30 to 50 places on the planet that produce

337
00:18:11.821 --> 00:18:14.760
almost all the intellectual property.
And when we look at these places,

338
00:18:14.761 --> 00:18:16.980
whether it's Televiv,
whether it's part of Shanghai,

339
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:20.790
whether it's a Anarbor Michigan or whether it's Palo Alto,
where you know Cary,

340
00:18:20.791 --> 00:18:22.440
North Carolina,
wherever you're at,

341
00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:26.040
one of the things you're going to see is it looks very different than any place

342
00:18:26.041 --> 00:18:29.460
if you drove 40 miles outside of the city boundaries,
right?

343
00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:31.650
And one of the things we see is that people are very different.

344
00:18:31.651 --> 00:18:33.540
I'm going to talk about why that's so important.

345
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:37.200
Now remember the whole idea that I started with talking about the magnitude of

346
00:18:37.201 --> 00:18:39.420
innovation and the momentum or the speed and magnitude.

347
00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:42.180
The two things you have to think about is how much and how fast.

348
00:18:42.181 --> 00:18:45.510
That's the question you always must ask yourself,
how much innovation,

349
00:18:45.511 --> 00:18:48.750
how fast is a meteor careening towards the earth?
It's going to kill us all.

350
00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:49.710
We better do something now.

351
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:53.970
Or is it that the the ice caps are melting and we probably should do something

352
00:18:53.971 --> 00:18:57.120
in the next four or five years in order to get our handle on this?
Right?

353
00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:59.340
Maybe it's even a little more urgent than that,
who knows?

354
00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:02.760
But the first thing that companies do is they build a process.

355
00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:06.360
Now here's a question to you.
Does process create deviance or eliminate deviance?

356
00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:11.580
What is process do it eliminates deviance.
Yeah,

357
00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:15.480
so the first thing we do to make innovation happen is what we built something to

358
00:19:15.481 --> 00:19:18.720
eliminate innovation.
And this is what we do in business schools.

359
00:19:18.721 --> 00:19:21.720
This is stage gating.
This is portfolio man.
But these are hurdle rates.

360
00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:25.650
So the notion is we're trying to gain control because what we really want from

361
00:19:25.651 --> 00:19:29.490
innovation is what we want to predictable revenue.

362
00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:33.240
We want predictable things.
So by definition,
when you build a process,

363
00:19:33.241 --> 00:19:36.270
you're going to be incremental because that's what processes are designed to do.

364
00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:38.130
That's what that tool is designed to do.
Now,

365
00:19:38.131 --> 00:19:41.430
what if we really wanted to do something with much higher magnitude for

366
00:19:41.431 --> 00:19:43.890
innovation?
Wouldn't we have to change the gene pool?

367
00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:48.540
It's like a great sports team or an orchestra or a band or a great chef when we

368
00:19:48.541 --> 00:19:52.030
have to go out and get people right?
How long did it take to,
to,
to,

369
00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:57.200
to develop a tremendous innovator here at Google a long time or a professor at

370
00:19:57.361 --> 00:20:00.720
Michigan or Stanford or Harvard or wherever you are,
wherever you came from,

371
00:20:00.721 --> 00:20:01.530
wherever you are.

372
00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:05.310
So the notion is this type of innovation is much higher but harder to do.

373
00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:08.730
That's why Google spends a lot of money on you developing you.

374
00:20:08.731 --> 00:20:11.460
Cause that's really important.
We do the same thing at Michigan.
Now.
Finally,

375
00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:14.490
if I really,
really want to change culture,
what I,

376
00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:18.090
if I really want to change the culture to make innovation happen,

377
00:20:18.091 --> 00:20:21.390
is that going to happen overnight?
It takes forever.

378
00:20:21.391 --> 00:20:23.700
Now I'm going to say something that's really controversial.

379
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.080
There's only two ways to change culture because culture isn't a thing you can

380
00:20:28.081 --> 00:20:32.850
touch.
Culture is in the ether cultures,
the way you talk,
it's their mindset.

381
00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:36.840
It's the,
it's the,
it's the,
it's the way you interact.
It's not a thing.

382
00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:40.020
Culture is contained in two things.
Number one is contained in leadership.

383
00:20:40.021 --> 00:20:40.854
How you lead,

384
00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:45.030
what do we do if you're acquiring an underperforming from what is the first step

385
00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:48.980
when you acquire an underperforming from your it there,
right knuckle bump,

386
00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:53.140
you'd get rid of the senior suite.
The Chinese have a wonderful saying.

387
00:20:53.141 --> 00:20:56.350
The fish stinks from the head.
They have a wonderful saying for everything,

388
00:20:56.351 --> 00:20:57.550
but that's what that means.

389
00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:01.180
That means you got to get rid of people because culture is contained in

390
00:21:01.181 --> 00:21:04.000
leadership and if you've got great leaders,
you get golden handcuffs.
Oh,

391
00:21:04.001 --> 00:21:05.650
they're going to stay for two or three years.

392
00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:08.550
The second thing that changes culture is how you work.
Now,

393
00:21:08.551 --> 00:21:10.960
I worked on a project that most of you know is ecoimagination.

394
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:15.370
It's the first $30 billion spend on the green technology that General Electric

395
00:21:15.371 --> 00:21:15.881
did.
Well,

396
00:21:15.881 --> 00:21:20.410
one of the things that people get wrong about that is it was not just to,
to,
uh,

397
00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:24.250
to change the game about a power which w which was partially,

398
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.580
but it was also to try and figure out how to get 28 divisions of one of the

399
00:21:27.581 --> 00:21:29.830
world's largest companies to work in sync.

400
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:34.840
So you either change how people lead or you change how they work.

401
00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:39.310
That's how culture gets changed,
but it takes a long time.

402
00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:43.630
So the issue is we all know what's required,
but are we willing to put the time?

403
00:21:43.631 --> 00:21:47.170
And so
what's the answer?
Well,

404
00:21:47.171 --> 00:21:50.130
one of my favorite answers comes from an old,
uh,

405
00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.890
an old philosophy called the doubt.
And you're going to see that a lot of my,

406
00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:55.500
a lot of,
um,
um,
of,

407
00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:59.470
of my work and standees work really relates from this old Chinese idea that's

408
00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:01.870
about 200 years before Plato is around.

409
00:22:01.871 --> 00:22:05.020
People start writing about this and at the heart of the Dow is the notion of the

410
00:22:05.021 --> 00:22:06.340
Yin and the Yang construct.

411
00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:09.550
The notion that there are conflicting forces in the universe and these

412
00:22:09.551 --> 00:22:13.300
conflicting forces produce hybrids.
They create new ways of doing things.

413
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:15.880
Well from this,
the Chinese have done something remarkable.

414
00:22:15.881 --> 00:22:19.540
I've spent a lot of time in China over the years.
The Chinese had developed a,

415
00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:23.530
a a way of thinking called the chain and it's called something,

416
00:22:23.531 --> 00:22:26.020
it's called the book of changes.
People use it for,
uh,
you know,

417
00:22:26.021 --> 00:22:27.280
like for predicting the future,

418
00:22:27.281 --> 00:22:30.640
but it's really used so that people can think through all the options that

419
00:22:30.641 --> 00:22:34.690
they've got.
This is sometimes called heuristics are cognitive algorithms.

420
00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:35.680
Finally,
out of this,

421
00:22:35.681 --> 00:22:38.440
there's a lot of how to books and the most famous one is a book called the art

422
00:22:38.441 --> 00:22:41.260
of War,
right?
Written by Sun Tzu.
Whether that was a real person or not,

423
00:22:41.261 --> 00:22:44.710
it's a real controversy.
Right?
And then finally that family household,

424
00:22:44.711 --> 00:22:47.770
how to use this day in and day out will function way.
Right?

425
00:22:47.771 --> 00:22:50.260
The whole notion of build upon the whole notion of having a compass to put this

426
00:22:50.261 --> 00:22:54.100
together and what it means is you don't have to have inputs and outputs and

427
00:22:54.101 --> 00:22:58.390
process because you're thinking the way I'm thinking and you're looking at all

428
00:22:58.391 --> 00:23:02.680
the options so I don't have to supervise you and tell you what to do.
Well,

429
00:23:02.681 --> 00:23:05.380
this is the heart of our thinking and this is the heart of our book.

430
00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:09.670
We had this sort of revelation in the early 1990s and that was the most

431
00:23:09.671 --> 00:23:12.730
innovative companies when we start looking at predictability of what was going

432
00:23:12.731 --> 00:23:16.510
to make an innovative company were companies that had constructive conflict.

433
00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:20.050
Now this is important because when I talk about constructive conflict,

434
00:23:20.051 --> 00:23:23.200
I'm not talking about talking disrespectfully to people.
That's not what I mean.

435
00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:28.060
I don't mean marginalizing people.
I mean we have fond regard,

436
00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:32.050
filial piety,
collegial piety for each other.
Hopefully we have,

437
00:23:32.051 --> 00:23:36.490
we like each other,
maybe love each other,
but it means when it comes to ideas,

438
00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:41.560
we engage.
Now,
engagement usually means we talked about engagement.
Oh,

439
00:23:41.561 --> 00:23:43.600
you really like being here at work.
No.

440
00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:47.330
When we start looking at innovation means you have an idea and I have an idea

441
00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:48.560
and their different ideas.

442
00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:52.040
Instead of being on social media and are sniping at each other as trolling each

443
00:23:52.041 --> 00:23:55.850
other,
I'm going to engage you.
I'm going to skid nose to nose you and say,

444
00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:58.340
I think it should be like this,
and you're going to say,

445
00:23:58.341 --> 00:24:01.730
I think it needs to be like this.
Now this is what a caution to millennials.

446
00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:05.660
This is not an opportunity for Q four for compromise.

447
00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:10.160
This is trying to push this to the new place.
The next idea,

448
00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.350
the third way,
a new way.

449
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:16.610
This becomes the generative power of innovation where you do it.

450
00:24:16.611 --> 00:24:18.290
I'll think about it for me to think about the healthcare debate,

451
00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.080
I got to get my Ted talk when President Obama rolled out.

452
00:24:21.081 --> 00:24:23.210
The affordable healthcare act at the White House is great.

453
00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.210
The problem is you've got one group that says you should all be public,

454
00:24:26.211 --> 00:24:29.570
and the other group says it should all be private.
Are those really are options,

455
00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:34.460
aren't the options,
everything in between and how do we take that forward,
right?

456
00:24:34.461 --> 00:24:37.610
We spend $1 trillion basically yelling at each other,
yelling over the fence.

457
00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:40.880
So my point about social media is we haven't had conflict.

458
00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:45.080
We've had yelling at each other,
but no one is engaged.
Everybody following us.

459
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:48.060
So the thing is we're going to engage ideas.
So there,

460
00:24:48.061 --> 00:24:52.940
there is no such thing as a safe place.
It means if we talk respectfully,

461
00:24:52.941 --> 00:24:53.780
we're going to engage.

462
00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:56.630
And this means that the heart of innovation is this concept of diversity.

463
00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:00.350
So diversity is more than just a moral issue.
And of course it is a moral issue,

464
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:03.740
but it's more,
and it's not just the color of your skin,
it's not,

465
00:25:03.741 --> 00:25:06.470
it's your belief system,
it's your cognitive maps,

466
00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:08.360
it's how you interact at your profession.

467
00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:13.660
So to do this standing and I build our model on Quinn and Cameron's monitor.

468
00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.620
Bob Quinn had been here I believe,

469
00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:19.550
and he was sort of one of my mentors along with CK pro a lot.
And Rudolf Arnheim,

470
00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:23.330
um,
Quinn,
this is their model called the competing values framework.

471
00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:25.430
We took it toward the innovation direction,

472
00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:27.500
did a lot of research on it over the past 30 years.

473
00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:30.050
And it's a often referred to as the innovation genome.

474
00:25:30.051 --> 00:25:32.090
If you read the popular literature,
the Innovation Code,

475
00:25:32.091 --> 00:25:33.530
so were the developers of that,

476
00:25:33.531 --> 00:25:37.580
and it basically says there are four types of innovators and they compete

477
00:25:37.581 --> 00:25:41.450
against each other.
And the,
the key to innovation is following these,

478
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:45.020
these kitty corner competitions and looking for hybrids.

479
00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:48.260
So I'm going to explain what each of these means in just a minute,
but to put it,

480
00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:49.850
to put it simply,

481
00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:54.050
innovation has longitude and latitude.

482
00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:57.080
There are two continuums of which you have to look at.

483
00:25:57.290 --> 00:25:59.120
And if you can figure out those two continuums,

484
00:25:59.121 --> 00:26:02.450
the most important thing are the dynamics between the opposites.

485
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:05.180
Now I want to emphasize this is not an opposite of type.

486
00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:08.780
This is not an opposite of style.
This is what you're trying to create,

487
00:26:08.781 --> 00:26:13.340
destroys what I'm trying to create.
So when quality goes up,
you reduce errors,

488
00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:18.590
right?
And innovation goes down.
When innovation goes up,
I introduce errors.

489
00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:22.820
This is sometimes called economy at risk,
right?
So there's a trade off.

490
00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:26.180
What we're saying is when these two things show up together,

491
00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:30.020
what we've learned in our research is those stocks over time,

492
00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:34.190
outperform all the other stocks,
right?
And they outperform.

493
00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:37.760
The index is that people have,
so these conflicts are going to become central.

494
00:26:37.761 --> 00:26:40.040
So let me talk a little bit about the conflicts.
Now.
First of all,

495
00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:43.170
this is not just about you.
I like to call these Russian Patricia,

496
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.810
the Russian nesting dolls,
right?
I don't know.
Do you do this?

497
00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:48.270
I read self help books and then I go,
you know what I'm going to do?

498
00:26:48.271 --> 00:26:50.910
I'm going to do this.
I'm going to go to Trevor City and I'm going to,

499
00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:53.340
I'm going to just going to quit my job and I'm going to,

500
00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:55.960
I'm going to write a crappy science fiction novels.

501
00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:58.680
There's what I'm doing and I've worked hard in my life,
made a little money.

502
00:26:58.681 --> 00:27:01.320
I'm doing okay.
I'm chucking it all.
That's what I'm doing.

503
00:27:01.321 --> 00:27:05.430
You're going to get to that point.
I've had enough of this.
Yeah,

504
00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:08.940
but there's another nesting doll on mine,
nesting doll.
It's called,

505
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.320
I married and I have three children and I have a dean and I business partners

506
00:27:13.321 --> 00:27:16.620
and I have people who count on me.
Right?
Yeah.
That's the other part.

507
00:27:16.621 --> 00:27:18.960
And then what happens after that is there's the real world.

508
00:27:18.961 --> 00:27:22.470
That's the big nesting doll.
There's a pandemic,
there's war,

509
00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:26.000
there's financial crisis.
Boy,
you young people got blown out.
Bad.
No,
wait,
I,

510
00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:31.020
that was pretty bad.
Yeah.
The notion is you don't act alone,
do you?

511
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:36.270
You Act in accordance to your community and you act in accordance to the

512
00:27:36.271 --> 00:27:39.480
situation.
So it's not about you.

513
00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:43.410
It's not about I'm this type and that's all equal.
That's not what's going on.

514
00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:47.520
What's going on is they're situational effectiveness and it's not situation like

515
00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:50.040
this is awkward,
like it's a social situation.

516
00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:54.480
It's like what's happening in the outside world and how do you need to act to do

517
00:27:54.481 --> 00:27:57.330
this?
It's like playing a sports game,
like football or soccer,

518
00:27:57.390 --> 00:27:58.530
whatever you follow.

519
00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:02.550
There's a time that you do a certain sort of things because it's appropriate to

520
00:28:02.551 --> 00:28:06.240
do it at times.
Surgeons the same way.
So let's look at the first one.

521
00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:09.060
The first one is the creative type or the artist type.

522
00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:12.930
I was really lucky when I was young.
I got to be an advisor to Steve Jobs.

523
00:28:12.931 --> 00:28:16.890
It was great.
Uh,
you know,
Walt Disney was one of my heroes.
Anybody like Disney,

524
00:28:16.891 --> 00:28:20.130
you know,
other than he had hit some opinions that were not very cool,

525
00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:24.330
but he did some cool stuff.
Um,
think about,
uh,
Elan Musk,

526
00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:26.730
think about Tesla,
not just a company,

527
00:28:26.731 --> 00:28:28.920
but the Nicky Tesla and all that kind of stuff.

528
00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:32.370
So what's interesting about this type of person is that they're very good in

529
00:28:32.371 --> 00:28:34.500
unique situations.
Things we haven't seen before.

530
00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:37.920
We're trying to cure an incurable disease.
We're going into a battle.

531
00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:40.590
That situation we've never seen before.
You know,

532
00:28:40.591 --> 00:28:42.270
as meteors careening towards the earth,

533
00:28:42.271 --> 00:28:45.960
it's highly unique so that you're making it up as you go along.

534
00:28:45.961 --> 00:28:48.210
There isn't really a lot of precedents for these people.

535
00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:51.240
They have a high tolerance for ambiguity,
love ambiguity,
right?

536
00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:54.510
They love to spread the field.
They love to try stuff.

537
00:28:54.511 --> 00:28:57.240
My favorite example of this is the large Hadron collider.

538
00:28:57.241 --> 00:29:00.780
Anybody remember three years ago,
the Bose,
the God particle,
right here we are,

539
00:29:00.781 --> 00:29:05.640
and at cern in Switzerland we have seven Nobel prize winners to believe it will

540
00:29:05.641 --> 00:29:07.230
create a black Fisher.
Do you remember this?

541
00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:10.110
They thought it would create a black hole and destroy the universe.

542
00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:13.580
They bet a beer and pulled the switch.
See you in hell.
You're again,

543
00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:17.850
these are these guys.
They're going to drive the Harley end of the pool.
Right?

544
00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:20.310
But they're going to see the future first cause they're looking for it.

545
00:29:20.311 --> 00:29:23.430
So the organizations are very ad hoc.
They're making it up as they go along,

546
00:29:23.431 --> 00:29:24.980
they're morphing.
People are coming.

547
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.480
They're going into these organizations and the artists themselves,

548
00:29:27.481 --> 00:29:31.080
what they really want is they want to be creative.
There's serial monogamous.

549
00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:33.900
They don't like staying in their job.
They're always looking at a new thing.

550
00:29:33.901 --> 00:29:35.670
They're all add.
Every last one of them,

551
00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:39.190
they pick up every pretty pebble on the beach.
You know what I mean?
This is that.

552
00:29:39.191 --> 00:29:42.910
It's a Fellini movie.
This is that group.
It's a grateful dead concert.
You know,

553
00:29:42.911 --> 00:29:44.710
Jerry's playing,
Mickey's in the bus,

554
00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:47.890
the girl and the white dress has had too many mushrooms and she spinning,

555
00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:50.440
you know the spinners.
So you're probably too young to remember all this.

556
00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:53.560
That's what's going on here.
This is this group of people.

557
00:29:53.561 --> 00:29:55.540
So they're have a high degree of innovation,

558
00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.890
but their speed is relatively moderate because the,
the,

559
00:29:58.891 --> 00:30:01.090
the delta is very large sums what's going to happen tomorrow.

560
00:30:01.091 --> 00:30:04.450
Others when hell freezes over.
But the biggest problem is they're high risk.

561
00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:07.930
Right?
Hold that bloat up.
Are you good?
Do you remember last fall,

562
00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:11.380
space x blew up $1 billion rocket and they blew Facebook's rocket to it.

563
00:30:11.381 --> 00:30:14.980
The t o that blown up.
Yeah.
How about that?
Yeah.
This is this group of people.

564
00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:20.290
So where we find them,
we find them taking risks,
we find them in strategy,

565
00:30:20.291 --> 00:30:21.400
we find them in the arts.

566
00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:25.060
I bet some of you want it to be in the arts and you sort of are in the arts,

567
00:30:25.061 --> 00:30:26.610
aren't ya?
Right.
Look at the,

568
00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:30.490
I look at sheepish looks because what you really want is freedom and you're held

569
00:30:30.491 --> 00:30:32.110
together by your vision.
Right?

570
00:30:32.111 --> 00:30:35.140
So one of the things I learned real early in being around these people,

571
00:30:35.141 --> 00:30:38.200
the early days of Silicon Valley where these visionaries who used to be like

572
00:30:38.201 --> 00:30:40.610
follow the dead or Ski Bums,
right?

573
00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:42.880
And then they built these companies including your own,
right?

574
00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:48.090
And how the opposite of this group can engage this group is do things like

575
00:30:49.091 --> 00:30:53.410
understand that this group is going to try and make problems bigger,
not smaller.

576
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:56.620
This group doesn't want an answer.
They want to,
they want to play.

577
00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:59.170
So bring a fifth of Jack Daniels and some crayons.

578
00:30:59.171 --> 00:31:01.330
You're going to do some color in,
right?
This is this group.

579
00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:04.960
They're never going to be on time,
right?
They,
they,
they're these,

580
00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:09.990
these are these people right now the opposite are the responsible people,

581
00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:13.600
the engineers,
I call them autonomous man.
I'm monogamous,
man.

582
00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:17.110
I've thought of it coming in here today.
It came fully formed from my forehead,

583
00:31:17.111 --> 00:31:20.890
like Athena and they quietly sing hi Ho.
Hi.
These are these guys.

584
00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:23.790
They know the right way and wrong way to do things and they'll point it out to,

585
00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:26.140
they love to tell you,
you know,
Jeff,
that's the wrong way to do that.

586
00:31:26.141 --> 00:31:29.380
I'm on all these famous journals and all these other journals,

587
00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:32.350
guys in the journal loved to tell me all the stuff I'm not doing right.
You know,

588
00:31:32.351 --> 00:31:35.770
Jeff,
you didn't have value.
I'm like,
I got it.
Okay.
We wear funny hats.

589
00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:38.440
We have medieval ceremonies,
the whole nine yards.

590
00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:42.190
So these people are going to be unpredictable situations where there's a lot of

591
00:31:42.191 --> 00:31:46.570
scale and failure's not an option.
You're gonna see three things scale,

592
00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:50.110
right?
We're,
we're,
we're,
we're selling a lot of something.
Whereas he complexity,

593
00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:53.680
think about Boeing and the new,
the new 87th as 2 million moving parts.
And,

594
00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:57.400
and the whole notion is,
you know,
you sent,
you bring that down the wrong way.

595
00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:00.040
It goes,
Kaboom.
Bad things happen.
You operate the wrong way.

596
00:32:00.041 --> 00:32:03.280
You send the young men,
and when women off to combat bad things happen.
Now,

597
00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:06.460
interestingly enough,
my favorite example predictables Mcdonald's,

598
00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:10.720
some illiterate kid presses a cheeseburger button and simultaneously somebody

599
00:32:10.721 --> 00:32:14.650
shoots a cow and Argentina Bang and everything in between happens in Smithers

600
00:32:14.651 --> 00:32:17.230
come here.
These are these guys,
right?
They want everything door.

601
00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:22.780
And ironically in Google as an Amazon,

602
00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:27.280
a lot of your success is here.
It's not in the green,

603
00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:30.730
it's here,
right?
You're running a back office.

604
00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:35.760
Very intricate supply chain is what you're doing with algorithms all over the

605
00:32:36.101 --> 00:32:39.190
place.
So it's all about efficiency and quality.

606
00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.600
Where the other one was about innovation and growth,

607
00:32:41.601 --> 00:32:42.740
radical innovation and growth.

608
00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:45.890
This is innovation to make things more efficient and make it work.

609
00:32:45.891 --> 00:32:48.080
And the people who run this,
we're going to call them engineers.

610
00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:50.870
It's all about security and productivity,
right?

611
00:32:50.871 --> 00:32:52.700
The whole idea of doing the right way and the wrong way.

612
00:32:52.701 --> 00:32:55.280
So you see that these are quite different than from each other.

613
00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:58.250
So these people are very good where there's large scale projects.

614
00:32:58.251 --> 00:33:01.250
We're going to build something really big like this whole campus up here,
uh,

615
00:33:01.251 --> 00:33:03.830
Google,
and we're going to have a right way and a wrong way.

616
00:33:03.831 --> 00:33:06.680
We're going to get these people who have have technical degrees,
engineering,

617
00:33:06.681 --> 00:33:07.850
medicine,
the sciences,

618
00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:12.230
and what these people want is they want responsibility because what they seek is

619
00:33:12.231 --> 00:33:17.231
they seek process and the reason they use process is because what they have to

620
00:33:17.391 --> 00:33:21.980
do is take the vision that the artist has and they have to materialize it.

621
00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:26.150
They have to build the stupid thing.
Right.
And it's an la artists.

622
00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:29.120
One of the things you love to tell the engineers is it's 80% done.

623
00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:33.410
What's it really mean?
It's 20% done on a good day.
You're not.

624
00:33:33.411 --> 00:33:35.960
Any of the artists will take credit for everything,
don't they?
Engineer?

625
00:33:35.961 --> 00:33:39.500
They take credit.
Yeah.
That's the way the artists are.
They crow about it.

626
00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:44.390
So what you can do artists when dealing with an engineer one show up on time,

627
00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:47.330
you know,
you think they don't notice,
oh,

628
00:33:47.331 --> 00:33:49.880
the engineers are the most passive aggressive group you got here.

629
00:33:49.881 --> 00:33:53.450
And on a dark night on a dark road,
you'll disappear.
They got a file on you.

630
00:33:53.451 --> 00:33:57.890
Like j Edgar Hoover,
right.
They've absolutely watch you,
right?
No look good.
Yeah.

631
00:33:57.891 --> 00:34:02.780
You know this right?
The notion is look at the data,
actually read the data,
right?

632
00:34:02.781 --> 00:34:06.620
How about that for a change in follow the accepted form and in the book there's

633
00:34:06.621 --> 00:34:09.350
a lot of the keys about this.
Now here's the point.

634
00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:15.100
The point is the success of this group comes down to your ability to partner

635
00:34:15.951 --> 00:34:16.820
with the opposite.

636
00:34:16.910 --> 00:34:19.340
So the first thing I'm telling you is on a very personal level,

637
00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:24.260
the person who makes you crazy is probably what's missing in your ability to

638
00:34:24.261 --> 00:34:27.580
grow as a person and your ability to add value to the organization.

639
00:34:27.810 --> 00:34:29.810
So when he following us,
number two,

640
00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:33.410
you have to manage appropriately to the outcome you want.

641
00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:38.390
So if I want the engineer outcome,
I have to use process.
It's complicated.

642
00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:40.160
If I want the artist outcome,

643
00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:42.980
I'm going to change the gene pool and I'm going to hedge.

644
00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:46.820
That's why startups run the way they do because they can't compete on scope or

645
00:34:46.821 --> 00:34:48.620
scale.
So the notion is I,

646
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:52.160
I've got a screwdriver or a hammer or a wrench and a saw,
they're great tools,

647
00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:55.130
they're not interchangeable.
And that becomes the first challenge.

648
00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:58.070
Now we have to encounter the other.
That's the key.

649
00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:00.950
I want you to think about your own organization.
Think about Larry and Serge.

650
00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:05.090
You see this,
they're opposite Lennon and Mccartney,
right?

651
00:35:05.091 --> 00:35:07.370
You're going to see this over and over again.

652
00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:11.120
You have to find the person that makes you crazy.
So I liked superheroes.

653
00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:14.900
So this is Johnny Storm,
the the flame.
Incidentally,

654
00:35:14.901 --> 00:35:16.850
superheroes need to be more inclusive.

655
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.390
I couldn't find any sort of balance superheroes,
so I'm sorry about that.

656
00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:23.120
But we'll have to get Stan Lee to work on that a little more.

657
00:35:23.121 --> 00:35:24.740
Maybe some of the newer ones I don't know about.

658
00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:28.460
And then we got to Richard's here.
Who sort of the red,
the red genius guy.
Well,

659
00:35:28.461 --> 00:35:31.280
let's turn this around and talk about,
uh,
one of my favorite groups,

660
00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:33.200
which is the compete group,
the blues.

661
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:39.210
These are the athletes I teach at the school of business where we grade on a

662
00:35:39.211 --> 00:35:43.350
curve,
right?
And we have sayings like,
don't send your ducks to Eagle School.

663
00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:47.400
And it's like the University of Chicago or Wharton or Mit,
right?

664
00:35:47.401 --> 00:35:49.230
The whole notion is it's competitive.

665
00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:53.670
That what we're trying to develop our athletes,
people who are positive.

666
00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:57.330
There go forward moving.
But the notion is they're ready to compete.

667
00:35:57.331 --> 00:35:58.650
They're ready to do what needs to be done.

668
00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:01.470
So these are people who are very good in contentious situations.

669
00:36:01.471 --> 00:36:04.350
So last week I was the keynote speaker at the air force,

670
00:36:04.351 --> 00:36:08.970
their big annual convention,
right?
You want athletes in your military services,

671
00:36:09.090 --> 00:36:13.680
right?
Because what their job is,
what is to keep everybody safe.
That's their job.

672
00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:16.530
So they're going to be aggressive and demanding situations.

673
00:36:16.531 --> 00:36:20.130
So whether you're a sports team and it's Michigan competing against Ohio state,

674
00:36:20.131 --> 00:36:23.220
or whether you're competing for potato chips or you're making smart phones,

675
00:36:23.221 --> 00:36:26.550
this is where there's someone else coming after you,
right?

676
00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:30.150
And we always make fun of these people until we need them.
They only need them.

677
00:36:30.151 --> 00:36:34.070
Then we then all,
then it's all different deal,
right?
These are Mbas,

678
00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:37.440
these are business people,
right?
And they're very market based organizations,

679
00:36:37.441 --> 00:36:39.960
meaning they face outside and they're beholden to shareholders,

680
00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:41.130
or they'd be holding the guidance.

681
00:36:41.131 --> 00:36:43.200
They have something that they've told people they're gonna accomplish.

682
00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:46.320
So they're very interested on speed and profitability.

683
00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:50.040
The notion of profitability even in a nonprofit is are,
you know,

684
00:36:50.041 --> 00:36:52.950
have we got bigger endowment?
You know,
Michigan likes to say,
you know,

685
00:36:52.951 --> 00:36:53.970
we're not interested in that.

686
00:36:53.971 --> 00:36:56.430
But of course the truth is all the best schools have what they have these huge

687
00:36:56.431 --> 00:36:58.380
endowments,
right?
And that's kind of the score.

688
00:36:58.381 --> 00:37:01.230
And finally these people are all about vitality and prosperity.

689
00:37:01.231 --> 00:37:03.690
And you must have some of these people because I'm walking around your building,

690
00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:06.450
you've got a gym and people are tracking how,
you know,

691
00:37:06.451 --> 00:37:10.820
how far are they fit and are they doing stuff and who's in first place and who's

692
00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:14.130
in last place and top 10 and bottom 10 so you're not fooling me,
Google,

693
00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:16.650
you've got these guys too.
And we need these people.

694
00:37:16.651 --> 00:37:19.320
We're going to find these people and a lot of places we're going to find them.

695
00:37:19.321 --> 00:37:21.150
Wherever the challenge is,
results driven,

696
00:37:21.151 --> 00:37:24.150
these are get it done people and they get it done very quickly.

697
00:37:24.151 --> 00:37:26.130
These are not long cycle people.

698
00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:28.620
So they're going to look where the goals are focused.

699
00:37:28.621 --> 00:37:31.020
Like we have to make the quarter where we got a problem,

700
00:37:31.021 --> 00:37:33.420
we've got to solve something.
Didn't work and it's got to work,

701
00:37:33.421 --> 00:37:35.520
but more importantly,
more importantly,

702
00:37:35.521 --> 00:37:39.450
we're going to find these people where challenges in resources result in some

703
00:37:39.451 --> 00:37:43.320
kind of a score.
Now,
what the sages can do,

704
00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:47.700
this is going to be an interesting thing because I have to warn you about blues

705
00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:52.350
boomers in the United States are typically blues.

706
00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:55.770
You know what?
When I came to college,
I came to college as a wrestler.

707
00:37:55.771 --> 00:37:59.640
I got got to come to college as a wrestler and that meant somebody got a gold

708
00:37:59.641 --> 00:38:03.270
medal and the rest of you were pathetic losers and either went to therapy or

709
00:38:03.271 --> 00:38:05.820
learn to drink.
That's what it was.
That my generation,

710
00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:07.140
you ever watched the Rudolph,

711
00:38:07.141 --> 00:38:10.500
the red nose reindeer thing at Christmas and you think Santa Claus is a total

712
00:38:10.501 --> 00:38:13.620
jerk?
Yeah,
that's,
that's my generation,
right?
We went to the moon.

713
00:38:13.621 --> 00:38:17.370
We look the commies,
we built the net,
right?
That's us.

714
00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:21.330
But our children are not those people.

715
00:38:21.331 --> 00:38:26.220
Our children have a little trouble with our goal.
Centricity,
our focus on goals,

716
00:38:26.221 --> 00:38:30.000
why we're obsessed with goals,
how,
why we compete and fight over.

717
00:38:30.001 --> 00:38:31.830
Everything's very confusing.
Well,

718
00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:35.620
our children are these sages and sages collaborate so they're very good at

719
00:38:35.621 --> 00:38:38.080
cooperative of of the lifestyle things.

720
00:38:38.081 --> 00:38:40.150
They're very good at searching and reapplying ideas.

721
00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:42.700
They're very good at sharing,
right?

722
00:38:42.701 --> 00:38:44.590
They don't like the idea of intellectual property.

723
00:38:44.591 --> 00:38:47.440
They don't like the idea that somebody owns something asymmetries.

724
00:38:47.441 --> 00:38:50.590
They have a very democratic notion of the world.
Very inclusive,

725
00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:53.650
a very consensus notion of the world in general.
Right?
In general,

726
00:38:53.651 --> 00:38:55.630
these are generalities.
Interestingly enough,

727
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:59.290
their organizations are very clannish,
very community oriented,

728
00:38:59.291 --> 00:39:00.670
very network oriented,

729
00:39:00.671 --> 00:39:03.940
so you're connecting to people that you want to connect with the you share some

730
00:39:03.941 --> 00:39:08.110
kind of personal affinity for your very values oriented,
right?

731
00:39:08.111 --> 00:39:09.760
Where the boomers are goal oriented,

732
00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:14.350
your values oriented and I believe this is creating the largest cultural shift

733
00:39:14.351 --> 00:39:15.310
in my lifetime.

734
00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:18.640
It's not like the 60s I want to tell you three things about young people that

735
00:39:18.641 --> 00:39:19.780
you probably already know.

736
00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:23.650
Over half of all live births to women under the age of 30 starting in 2014 or

737
00:39:23.651 --> 00:39:26.020
outside of marriage.
The more educated the woman is,

738
00:39:26.021 --> 00:39:29.080
the less likely she is to marry.
Marriage is no longer normative.

739
00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:33.940
I had been married forever,
right?
She's been married to me forever.
Right?

740
00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:38.140
The notion of what you want to do for a living here at Google is this a lifetime

741
00:39:38.141 --> 00:39:41.200
event at Google,
you are going to be your forever,
interestingly enough,

742
00:39:41.201 --> 00:39:44.620
according to the Pew Charitable Trust,
what do you really want out of life?

743
00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:45.670
You want to have impact,

744
00:39:45.671 --> 00:39:49.750
you want to make meaning you want to take time off to cure river blindness in

745
00:39:49.751 --> 00:39:54.160
Tanzania because you care about co co culture,
right?
As opposed to my generation.

746
00:39:54.161 --> 00:39:54.671
And finally,

747
00:39:54.671 --> 00:39:58.570
the other thing that's very big is we ask young people what their religious

748
00:39:58.571 --> 00:40:02.690
affiliation is.
The number one growth areas.
What?
No affiliation,
right?

749
00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:06.250
So if you're talking to a boomer,
I've been married forever,
right?

750
00:40:06.251 --> 00:40:09.220
I'm a practicing Roman Catholic and I'm a capitalist pig,
right?

751
00:40:09.221 --> 00:40:12.070
To teach in a business school.
So we're different about this.

752
00:40:12.071 --> 00:40:14.710
It doesn't mean we can't get along and it doesn't mean we don't have a lot to

753
00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:17.320
teach each other.
But the notion is,
and it's,
and it's,

754
00:40:17.321 --> 00:40:20.320
I'm doing this in a very gross way.
Obviously it's sort of teach this,

755
00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:23.650
but I also want to point out that the Chinese are a clannish culture.

756
00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:26.200
They're the opposite of American culture.

757
00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:29.260
American culture became American culture in a very ballistic way,

758
00:40:29.261 --> 00:40:30.094
in a very hard way.

759
00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:33.670
I want you to think about 2008 September 15th when Lehman crashed,

760
00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:37.720
between September 15th of January one we laid off 6 million people.
Bang,
Bang,

761
00:40:37.721 --> 00:40:42.580
Bang.
Right?
But we also hired him back faster.
This culture doesn't write,

762
00:40:42.581 --> 00:40:44.380
takes care of people because the valley's centric,

763
00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:47.350
but also takes longer to bring it back.
So it's a long cycle culture.

764
00:40:47.590 --> 00:40:51.670
We find these people and community service places where our conflict is managed.

765
00:40:51.671 --> 00:40:53.190
We find these people where we're,

766
00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:56.080
we're dealing with people in a way that we're trying to,

767
00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:59.090
we're trying to help them develop.
We're trying to mitigate,
uh,

768
00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:02.110
we're trying to mitigate conflicts and we're going to find these people where,

769
00:41:02.111 --> 00:41:03.700
where harmony is paramount,

770
00:41:03.701 --> 00:41:06.340
where people are respecting each other in a way that they don't,

771
00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:09.160
they don't have the kind of conflicts that I'm suggesting here.

772
00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:13.690
So how can the athletes engage people,
athletes,
boomers like me,

773
00:41:14.350 --> 00:41:17.440
we have to be more patient.
That's a big one,
you know,

774
00:41:17.441 --> 00:41:20.560
because you've got a lot of things that you'll say,
I need more time on this.

775
00:41:20.561 --> 00:41:22.630
And if you're a boomer,
what boomers said,
oh,
you don't have more time.

776
00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:27.610
So on Wednesday we have to be more,
uh,
it co cheerful with you.
You know,
how,

777
00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:30.610
uh,
how,
uh,
uh,
people will say you can do it.

778
00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:34.370
There's all this big thing of a positivity now and what are of old boomers like

779
00:41:34.371 --> 00:41:38.120
me thinking,
no,
you suck.
You can't sit down.
Right?
That's what we're thinking.

780
00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:41.840
But no,
you're encouraged.
So we have to be understanding of that.
Right?

781
00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:44.840
And of course,
I'm dealing in,
in,
uh,
in gross generalities here.

782
00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:47.390
But the notion is the challenge here,

783
00:41:47.391 --> 00:41:51.110
the other thing that predicts value is that these two things get along.

784
00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:55.490
And that's one of the secrets I think to when my generation and your generation

785
00:41:55.491 --> 00:41:57.560
collaborate when Americans and Chinese collaborator,

786
00:41:57.650 --> 00:42:01.220
I think there's something very powerful that happens in those communities.

787
00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:05.360
So I think of this like sue storm and the thing I'd sue storms are my favorite

788
00:42:05.361 --> 00:42:07.910
ones.
She could,
she has a force field.
How many like a force field,

789
00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:10.280
she can read your mind.
That's what I want to do.
Read your mind,

790
00:42:10.281 --> 00:42:13.580
read my kid's mind,
protect them.
Right?
And then the thing just smashes stuff.

791
00:42:13.581 --> 00:42:17.000
I'm sorry that my generation is kind of the thing saying we apologize but things

792
00:42:17.001 --> 00:42:20.090
need to be smashed every now and then.
So there is a whole worldview here.

793
00:42:20.091 --> 00:42:23.120
I'm not going to spend any time on this,
but this is not sort of pop psychology.

794
00:42:23.121 --> 00:42:27.230
There's a lot of work about how you think about time,
how you think about space,

795
00:42:27.231 --> 00:42:29.900
what you value,
what you chase,
who you want to be dealing with.

796
00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:34.130
So these worldviews are very deep,
right?
And the,

797
00:42:34.131 --> 00:42:39.020
and they can be partially cultural and there's a lot of neurobiology that says

798
00:42:39.021 --> 00:42:40.880
some of this may actually be hardwired.

799
00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:43.490
I don't want to go there because then you start getting into eugenics.

800
00:42:43.491 --> 00:42:46.610
But the notion is we are a combination of our biology and our history and our

801
00:42:46.611 --> 00:42:49.490
experiences,
right?
So there's problems.

802
00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:53.510
Let me tell you a problem this comes with with anyone who's been married for a

803
00:42:53.511 --> 00:42:57.260
long time will tell you that.
Can you change the other person?

804
00:42:57.261 --> 00:42:59.900
Now you're all young and you think you can,
can you check I,

805
00:42:59.901 --> 00:43:03.470
you just have to tell you as I'm,
I'm a pod from the future,

806
00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:06.980
you're not going to change the other person.
The number one year for divorces,

807
00:43:06.981 --> 00:43:10.580
when it's your one,
your one,
what you figure out in year one,

808
00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:14.330
they're not going to change.
You either can live with this or you can't.

809
00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:16.730
That's it.
So why am I telling you this?

810
00:43:16.731 --> 00:43:18.710
Because you're going to try and change these people and you can't.

811
00:43:18.711 --> 00:43:21.140
So what's the problem when you get the reds in your group,

812
00:43:21.141 --> 00:43:22.700
what do they always do?
They're very judgmental.

813
00:43:22.701 --> 00:43:25.100
They'll tell you the right way and the wrong way to do things right.

814
00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:28.280
When you get the Greens in the groups,
what do they do?
They have no discipline.

815
00:43:28.281 --> 00:43:31.820
They get up and walk away.
They don't follow up.
They have bad methodologies.

816
00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:35.320
What are the blues?
The Blues loved to take over the blues of Ghana.

817
00:43:35.330 --> 00:43:38.180
They can be boring or I'm good,
but here's what we should do.
Short term,

818
00:43:38.181 --> 00:43:41.300
let's make the meeting five minutes.
It's like a drive by shooting,
Bang,
Bang,

819
00:43:41.301 --> 00:43:41.720
Bang,

820
00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:44.990
PowerPoint slides everywhere because they can't speak in complete sentences yet.

821
00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:48.440
Right?
And finally,
when you get the yellow,
it's all about,
oh,

822
00:43:48.441 --> 00:43:51.110
we can pull together and we can do,
let's just have another meeting.

823
00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:54.560
The notion is you're gonna try and change that.
You can't.

824
00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:57.290
This is the downside that goes with the upside.

825
00:43:57.291 --> 00:44:01.610
This is what you have to deal with.
Nation states also have this challenge.

826
00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:05.210
Now every nation state has all four of these Indian.
The whole idea of it,

827
00:44:05.211 --> 00:44:08.780
of nation states.
Kind of an old idea,
but think about Japanese culture.

828
00:44:08.781 --> 00:44:11.980
Why were the Japanese so good at quality after the war when we invented

829
00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:15.860
basically invented quality six sigma in New York,
right?

830
00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:19.900
So what's been interesting is the Japanese had a 2000 year old tradition of Hari

831
00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:23.390
design.
This is part of their culture,
right?
Think about the Netherlands.

832
00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:25.520
My name is the graph,
right?
The Netherlands.

833
00:44:25.521 --> 00:44:28.040
How has the Netherlands been able to have this incredible,

834
00:44:28.041 --> 00:44:31.070
prosperous a community?
It's a really small country.

835
00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:34.170
The tallest country in the world.
If you know this,
I'm,
I'm but not representing,

836
00:44:34.171 --> 00:44:35.280
well,
my mother is Hungarian.

837
00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:39.630
But the notion is because things have gone well after the war because the Dutch

838
00:44:39.631 --> 00:44:42.510
can't compete on scope or scale.
So they have to go out and trade.

839
00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:45.240
They have to invent stuff,
right?
Think about the United States.

840
00:44:45.241 --> 00:44:46.830
How did we get to be the United States?

841
00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:50.550
You either came here to chase gold mountain,
you came to escape desire.

842
00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:53.670
You came here and chains or you thought you were here,
right?

843
00:44:53.671 --> 00:44:57.030
It was not exactly a picnic,
right?
That's how we do things.

844
00:44:57.031 --> 00:45:00.870
Rather ballistically and finally think about China where they're over 50 words

845
00:45:00.871 --> 00:45:03.000
in Chinese for which uncle are you?
Are you the rich uncle?

846
00:45:03.001 --> 00:45:05.730
Are you the crazy uncle?
The uncle?
We avoid the uncle.
We saw cop too.

847
00:45:05.731 --> 00:45:06.660
Who are you in the family?

848
00:45:07.050 --> 00:45:10.200
The notion is you're always going to see this and what happens is we have a

849
00:45:10.201 --> 00:45:13.980
tendency to vilify the people who aren't like us,
right?

850
00:45:13.981 --> 00:45:17.160
Instead of understanding them and that becomes the big challenge.

851
00:45:17.161 --> 00:45:19.660
So we have to have the right person at the right job.
Now I'm going to take,

852
00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:23.040
I'm going to throw some self help stuff out the window.
It's going to upset you,

853
00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:25.530
but I'm going to tell you what basically the research says.
First off,

854
00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:29.340
the assumption of type doesn't mean competency.
Oh,
I'm an artist,
but you suck,

855
00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:32.460
right?
You're just not a good artist.
The assumption that talent can be developed,

856
00:45:32.461 --> 00:45:35.400
this is my favorite one.
It can be developed to a point,

857
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.220
but you're not going to make Mozart or Michael Jordan.

858
00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:41.980
Those are things that are a confluence of natural talent and the situation that

859
00:45:41.981 --> 00:45:45.210
they find themself in assumption that all types of Rico,
they're not.

860
00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:48.060
If I'm an investment banker,
what am I trying to do?
I'm trying to do blue stuff.

861
00:45:48.330 --> 00:45:50.550
If I'm a university professor,
I'm trying to do yellow stuff.

862
00:45:50.730 --> 00:45:52.830
So the blues are going to be more valuable in one situation,

863
00:45:52.831 --> 00:45:55.800
the Elos and another,
and finally the assumption that balance is better.

864
00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:58.290
Not necessarily.
So when I'm starting a project,

865
00:45:58.291 --> 00:46:01.110
the Greens are genius because they love the ambiguity,

866
00:46:01.111 --> 00:46:02.850
makes stuff as they go along.
At the end,

867
00:46:02.851 --> 00:46:05.700
the reds are geniuses and everybody in between is a,
is a genius.

868
00:46:05.701 --> 00:46:08.250
Now remember I haven't spoken about the exercise exercise.

869
00:46:08.251 --> 00:46:11.730
What they're geniuses at is connecting boomers and millennials.

870
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:13.380
Xers are the smallest generation,

871
00:46:13.381 --> 00:46:15.810
but they're the most ambidextrous generation we've seen.

872
00:46:16.050 --> 00:46:19.140
So the only reason I talked about boomers and millennials is where the largest

873
00:46:19.141 --> 00:46:23.010
generations by far relatively extra smaller Gen z are going to be smaller,

874
00:46:23.070 --> 00:46:26.040
but they might be the most valuable,
right?
And incidentally,
millennials,

875
00:46:26.041 --> 00:46:28.740
remember this,
there's more of you now than there are of us.

876
00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:32.520
You're on the sunny side of the hill and if you ever figure that out
politically,

877
00:46:32.521 --> 00:46:35.040
boy,
it's going to get real interesting real fast,
right?

878
00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:38.070
So the direction you move under stress is what people really are.

879
00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:40.740
So if you really want to know what somebody is,
see what they do,

880
00:46:40.741 --> 00:46:44.280
and they're really under stress.
Do they go get on social media,
talk to friends?

881
00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:46.920
Did they shorten the field and sort of look at the three things in front and

882
00:46:46.921 --> 00:46:48.270
they look at the data,
you know,

883
00:46:48.271 --> 00:46:51.600
do they go to weasel out of stuff to sort of go off the reservation and do all

884
00:46:51.601 --> 00:46:54.390
kinds of creative stuff that will tell you what that person is.

885
00:46:54.391 --> 00:46:58.290
But here becomes the,
the money part of this.
This is the key part.

886
00:46:58.590 --> 00:47:01.880
How you innovate is what you innovate.
How you innovate is what you innovate.

887
00:47:01.890 --> 00:47:03.990
You want radical innovation.
You've got to embrace the artist.

888
00:47:04.290 --> 00:47:07.290
You want to get scale.
You got embraced the engineer,
you want to go fast,

889
00:47:07.291 --> 00:47:09.570
you got embraced the athlete,
you want to build some sustainable,

890
00:47:09.571 --> 00:47:12.660
embraced the sage,
and you need all four of these to win.

891
00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:15.600
So here's the biggest problems you're gonna run into and we're going to talk

892
00:47:15.601 --> 00:47:16.920
about the data in one second on this.

893
00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:21.360
The biggest problem you have is that the people who are in the green position

894
00:47:21.361 --> 00:47:25.470
are orphans.
The artists are orphans.
You know the city that you're in right now.

895
00:47:25.471 --> 00:47:28.980
And Arbor has more venture capital per person than any city in the United
States.

896
00:47:29.170 --> 00:47:34.000
The problem is,
does it relate to anything else in this state?
No,
you're orphans.

897
00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:38.860
So the problem is you got to snuggle up to people who are trying to make a

898
00:47:38.861 --> 00:47:40.690
living and do things in other areas.

899
00:47:40.930 --> 00:47:43.210
The second problem are the blues and the yellows,

900
00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:46.540
and the problem is they're oppositional dogs and cats.
So one,

901
00:47:46.570 --> 00:47:49.720
you have to really engage the conflict.
And the second problem is,

902
00:47:49.721 --> 00:47:52.840
this is by far the longest cycle of innovation is sometimes called death valley

903
00:47:52.990 --> 00:47:56.140
or the bottom of the bathtub.
How many Ben and a project that lost momentum?

904
00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:58.960
Anybody been on a project that lost momentum and he sorta,

905
00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:01.990
and you have to platoon players in and out.
Yeah,
this is that part.

906
00:48:02.350 --> 00:48:04.390
If finally the reds,
the engineers,

907
00:48:04.391 --> 00:48:09.220
the problem is they're so optimized that there's no room to try anything else.

908
00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:11.020
And so when the new thing shows up,

909
00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:14.590
they're not prepared for the new things because every moment of their life is

910
00:48:14.591 --> 00:48:18.190
basically taken up.
So we have to rely on each other.
Now.

911
00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:21.070
The other thing that's very important about the dynamics,
which is a key point,

912
00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:24.730
is innovation doesn't move from the inside out.
Moves from the outside in,

913
00:48:25.090 --> 00:48:27.490
and think about this for a minute.
When do people really change?

914
00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:31.780
When do you really change?
I mean really?
Yeah,
when you made a mistake,

915
00:48:31.810 --> 00:48:34.990
when your life sucks,
when you get divorced,
when you lose a job,

916
00:48:34.991 --> 00:48:37.810
when your house goes away,
somebody close to you passes away.

917
00:48:37.811 --> 00:48:39.370
Why do you change when your life sucks?

918
00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:43.780
Because the risk of trying something radical and the reward of seeing where

919
00:48:43.781 --> 00:48:46.750
you're at is reversed in a crisis.

920
00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:52.180
Everybody falling us whether this is apple trading at $3 a share in 1997 right?

921
00:48:53.830 --> 00:48:57.250
Whether this is Gandhi and the march to the sea,
it also has a negative effect.

922
00:48:57.251 --> 00:48:58.690
This is also Hitler in the Brown shirts.

923
00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:01.570
The notion is it doesn't move inside out.

924
00:49:01.571 --> 00:49:05.410
It moves outside in where the middle of the organization is trying to do what?

925
00:49:05.411 --> 00:49:09.430
Maintain and the outside is trying to do what?
Introduce diversity.
Now,

926
00:49:09.431 --> 00:49:12.010
the other time that people change is when,
when they're on a roll,

927
00:49:12.250 --> 00:49:15.490
you win the lottery,
you got promoted your nerve,
all that stuff.

928
00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:17.890
Why do you try stuff then?
Because the same thing,

929
00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:20.440
the risk of trying something radical and the reward of where you're at is

930
00:49:20.441 --> 00:49:24.040
reversed,
right?
It's called risk capital,
right?
In our world,
and instantly Google,

931
00:49:24.041 --> 00:49:27.070
you've had a lot of risk,
capital flight pass,
10 years,
lot of risk capital.

932
00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:30.490
So the notion is don't launch innovation from the inside out because what will

933
00:49:30.491 --> 00:49:33.310
happen to that innovation is what the organization will begin to converge it.

934
00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:37.420
It begin to make it more incremental.
You have to start at the perimeter.

935
00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:40.120
The farther away you can be from headquarters,

936
00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:42.880
the farther you can be away from the watchful eye,

937
00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:46.690
the better off you're going to be.
Now this leads us to this last slide here.

938
00:49:47.050 --> 00:49:49.060
This is referred to as,
um,

939
00:49:49.570 --> 00:49:52.720
as the Schumpeter cycle and the Schumpeter cycle.

940
00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:56.020
I want you to think about this for a minute.
Um,
first of all,

941
00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:59.830
organizations are created by Greens.
Typically they want it.

942
00:49:59.831 --> 00:50:02.100
They want to have freedom.
This is your,

943
00:50:02.110 --> 00:50:05.680
this is Larry and Serge created in a garage in Menlo,
right?

944
00:50:05.681 --> 00:50:06.610
This is what this was,

945
00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:09.850
but next we got to get money involved and these are the people who gave you

946
00:50:09.851 --> 00:50:12.200
money early on,
right?
These are the big,
the,

947
00:50:12.201 --> 00:50:13.930
these are the big Apollo funds and things.

948
00:50:13.931 --> 00:50:16.720
It gave Google money at the very beginning and they focus the two.

949
00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:18.790
Then what happens is you grow ballistically.

950
00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:20.950
We got to get the yellow's on board because we've got to have the right people

951
00:50:20.951 --> 00:50:22.270
sell the right people,
build the right community,

952
00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:25.660
and then we have to have ultimately the reds on board because we have to get to

953
00:50:25.661 --> 00:50:29.240
scale somebody following us.
Now,
what's important about this,

954
00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:33.980
once we get to scale,
the problem is every capital committee person,

955
00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:37.770
every metric that we've got,
every,
every,
uh,

956
00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:41.540
process that we've run is designed to do what?
To deviance

957
00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:47.300
to eliminate it.
Why didn't,
why didn't series become Amazon?

958
00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:51.680
Why didn't Microsoft Become Google?
Right?

959
00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:56.690
Why didn't Mcdonald's become Starbucks?
It had nothing to do with competition.

960
00:50:57.080 --> 00:51:01.010
They had all the stuff in the lab,
right?
You know this,
the notion is,

961
00:51:01.070 --> 00:51:03.350
and this is the radical part of this whole discussion,

962
00:51:03.590 --> 00:51:07.430
what Schumpeter said is radical and whether it depends on who you're talking to.

963
00:51:07.431 --> 00:51:09.770
We had six or seven Nobel prize winners in economics.

964
00:51:09.771 --> 00:51:11.390
It's 90 69 I've talked about this.

965
00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:15.650
The radical part of this is that what Schumpeter said is that we're not

966
00:51:15.651 --> 00:51:20.330
destroyed by competitors.
For chump hater said is we kill ourselves.

967
00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:22.430
We have seen the enemy and he is us.

968
00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:26.630
Our dominant logic becomes so strong we can't get over it,
right?

969
00:51:26.631 --> 00:51:28.100
And as a nation state in America,

970
00:51:28.101 --> 00:51:31.970
aren't we suffering from this right now that we can't get over our dominant

971
00:51:31.971 --> 00:51:34.070
logic,
we can't see the other.

972
00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:39.020
He calls this the point of creative destruction.
And ironically,

973
00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:43.190
organizations that begin to fail quickly have a much better chance of innovating

974
00:51:43.191 --> 00:51:45.530
because they have to go back to the beginning of the cycle.

975
00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:48.260
Apple trading at $3 a share,
somebody following us.

976
00:51:48.590 --> 00:51:53.590
But think about General Motors in 1950 had 53% of the world car market drip,

977
00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:56.300
drip,
drip.
It's called flatlining.

978
00:51:56.420 --> 00:52:00.650
So the notion is there's an interesting sort of confounding a part to this where

979
00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:04.880
even though there's tension,
the best thing that can happen is when one,

980
00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:09.080
a cycle shifts into the other cycle in a relatively straightforward way.

981
00:52:09.081 --> 00:52:11.270
So we can put cause in fact together.
So here's what,

982
00:52:11.271 --> 00:52:13.770
here's the thing to do and then going to turn this over to standing.

983
00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:16.700
She can talk about the book and what you can do here in your work.

984
00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:20.270
Stop believing you can see the future.
Make smaller,
wider bets,

985
00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:24.860
choosing big over fast.
No,
pick up your pace.
Go faster,
right?

986
00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:28.310
Mistaking your managers for innovators.
Know,
encourage,

987
00:52:28.311 --> 00:52:32.900
encourage and support your Weirdos.
We need Weirdos.

988
00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:37.400
And incidentally,
if you're an organization that's really green,
Weirdos are reds,

989
00:52:38.090 --> 00:52:41.270
everybody following us.
If you're a total,
if you're a yellow organization,

990
00:52:41.271 --> 00:52:42.230
the Weirdos are blue.

991
00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:46.820
They're just not like you having more ambition than capability,
right?

992
00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:50.690
Talent matters.
You got to go out and build on the capability you have.

993
00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:53.330
I love what the armed forces say.
You don't fight with army.
You want,

994
00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:55.640
you fight with the army you have.
Right?
Which I think is great.

995
00:52:55.850 --> 00:52:58.430
Starting at the center,
move out.
It's not student body,
right?

996
00:52:58.460 --> 00:52:59.510
It's a perimeter game.

997
00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:02.680
I worked on a project that you know that was originally called [inaudible].

998
00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:05.930
If you know what is coke zero worked on coke zero.

999
00:53:06.170 --> 00:53:08.450
The problem with coke zero was everybody thought they had it right and they

1000
00:53:08.451 --> 00:53:10.820
launched it to c two.
We had to move it out of site,

1001
00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:15.350
work it out off Broadway and bring it back and that became coke zero.
Um,

1002
00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:18.530
listening to the wrong people,
don't listen to the customers.

1003
00:53:18.531 --> 00:53:20.660
Who are your big customers because are they going to move first?

1004
00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:23.150
They can move last.
Finally failing to connect the dots.

1005
00:53:23.151 --> 00:53:26.130
You got to connect the dots.
That's why we're here.
You got to put all four

1006
00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:28.440
<v 2>of these together.
Now,
the last part of this,</v>

1007
00:53:28.441 --> 00:53:30.180
I want standing to come up and talk about this.

1008
00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:33.900
I want to talk about the book and the four steps in the book and what you could

1009
00:53:33.901 --> 00:53:36.090
do to actually engage the constructive conflict.

1010
00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:37.890
<v 3>I got it.</v>

1011
00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:45.500
<v 2>Hey,
so what?
I won't bore you now.
I won't take too long,
but we'll be created.</v>

1012
00:53:45.501 --> 00:53:49.670
But for speedy simple steps for you guys to create a constructive conflicts

1013
00:53:49.671 --> 00:53:52.630
because the thing about it is you actually have to do this every day.
It's,

1014
00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:56.870
it's not once you get,
it's almost like a muscle.
They,
that you have to exercise.

1015
00:53:57.080 --> 00:54:00.470
Once you got it,
it becomes really easy.
But if you've never done it before,

1016
00:54:00.471 --> 00:54:04.650
it can be pretty awkward and can be quite difficult and actually quite,
um,

1017
00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:06.890
quite intimidating to start first.

1018
00:54:06.891 --> 00:54:10.820
So what the first thing that you have to do is really assembled diversity of

1019
00:54:10.821 --> 00:54:13.730
perspective.
What I love about this building that's got to give us a tour.

1020
00:54:13.970 --> 00:54:15.590
If there's so many spaces here,

1021
00:54:15.591 --> 00:54:18.950
they're very open spaces that anybody can just go to.

1022
00:54:19.220 --> 00:54:21.440
So that's the first thing is,
you know,

1023
00:54:21.441 --> 00:54:26.030
I always talk to our clients and I will say there has to be a space where people

1024
00:54:26.031 --> 00:54:30.410
actually can just go in and just talk to one another,
like a normal human being.

1025
00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:33.500
If you put them just in cubicles and there's no way for them to go anywhere,

1026
00:54:33.710 --> 00:54:35.750
how are they actually going to meet at the people.

1027
00:54:36.170 --> 00:54:39.800
But this also talks about recruiting,
you know,
Aina Company.

1028
00:54:39.801 --> 00:54:43.370
You can't just recruit one type of person or one type of skill.

1029
00:54:43.550 --> 00:54:45.410
You might want to combine,
you know,

1030
00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:49.280
the skills you looking for with the kind of age you're looking for with,

1031
00:54:49.281 --> 00:54:49.581
you know,

1032
00:54:49.581 --> 00:54:52.850
the kind of skin color you're killing four with the kind of background with the

1033
00:54:52.851 --> 00:54:56.180
kind of do you know,
diversity of thought.
Where's this person coming from?

1034
00:54:56.450 --> 00:54:57.310
So it once you,

1035
00:54:57.320 --> 00:55:01.280
you have to have a pool of people in which you can communicate on a regular

1036
00:55:01.281 --> 00:55:06.050
basis.
And I think this is what Jeff always talks about is,
you know,
I,
I,

1037
00:55:06.830 --> 00:55:11.030
we have three children and my youngest is 16 and they're always in social media.

1038
00:55:11.390 --> 00:55:14.060
And what I do see and social media too is,
um,

1039
00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:17.180
people start only looking and you know,

1040
00:55:17.181 --> 00:55:21.260
my friends are my friends and my friends have the similar view that I do.

1041
00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:24.890
And I get frustrated when I see like in a different point of view.

1042
00:55:24.891 --> 00:55:28.190
That to me was attacking my point of view.
I don't like that.

1043
00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:30.260
And I know people do that.
You know,
we,

1044
00:55:30.261 --> 00:55:33.950
we have our own niches and that's actually quite dangerous for what we want to

1045
00:55:33.951 --> 00:55:37.160
do.
You know,
we should just open up and start talking,

1046
00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:41.070
have a conversation with somebody else who's very different from us.
Um,

1047
00:55:41.150 --> 00:55:45.680
I was just talking to my intern and she was talking about how do you meet New

1048
00:55:45.681 --> 00:55:46.431
People?
And I said,

1049
00:55:46.431 --> 00:55:49.760
well I used to just to go to cafes and then a lot of people come cause this is

1050
00:55:49.761 --> 00:55:53.240
like I've never met any new person in a cafe.
I'm like,

1051
00:55:53.241 --> 00:55:55.610
it's totally different world now.
I totally get that.

1052
00:55:55.850 --> 00:56:00.580
But I think that's why you like you have to have to make the first step.
And um,

1053
00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:05.200
so this is like the kind of types of the four colors that you can find useful.

1054
00:56:05.201 --> 00:56:10.160
The engineers are very organized so they can be scientists,
analysts,

1055
00:56:10.220 --> 00:56:12.800
those kinds of things and seizures are teachers and so forth.

1056
00:56:12.801 --> 00:56:14.450
So you can look at that.

1057
00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:19.460
But the second step is then you have to actually engage it.
So we are talking,

1058
00:56:19.461 --> 00:56:21.620
but if we're doing brainstorming for example,

1059
00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:26.050
to solve a particular idea how a particular challenge in your organization,

1060
00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:26.471
you know,

1061
00:56:26.471 --> 00:56:30.970
gather everybody and make sure that it all four colors and then put in one
space,

1062
00:56:30.971 --> 00:56:34.360
one room and then just engage.
You actually have to talk.

1063
00:56:34.361 --> 00:56:36.580
This is what I was talking about.
If you do not,

1064
00:56:36.610 --> 00:56:40.000
if you do not agree with something,
that's it.
I don't agree with that.

1065
00:56:40.001 --> 00:56:42.670
You don't have to be mean.
You can be respectful,

1066
00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:46.810
but you have to engage in I think,
um,
and forgive me if I'm wrong,

1067
00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:51.640
but I also noticed that in my children,
especially at the 16 year old,
he's,

1068
00:56:52.060 --> 00:56:53.710
he doesn't like conflict.

1069
00:56:54.070 --> 00:56:57.370
So he doesn't like telling people I don't agree with you.

1070
00:56:57.850 --> 00:57:02.170
And it's easy for him to do in social media and to write something about instead

1071
00:57:02.171 --> 00:57:03.550
of just walking to the person and say,

1072
00:57:03.551 --> 00:57:06.670
I really disagree and this is actually a skill that you have to do.

1073
00:57:06.671 --> 00:57:11.470
You actually have to engage that with this open mindedness and conversation is

1074
00:57:11.471 --> 00:57:12.280
really when we,

1075
00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:16.480
when we create a cognitive dissonance in our brain and then we start thinking

1076
00:57:16.481 --> 00:57:17.440
about new things.

1077
00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:22.920
So one of the things that we also talk about is talk about like use this and say

1078
00:57:23.261 --> 00:57:26.950
what worked and what doesn't work and go through the four callers to see what's

1079
00:57:26.951 --> 00:57:27.350
working,

1080
00:57:27.350 --> 00:57:31.330
what doesn't right now and to figure out what solutions we can we can come out

1081
00:57:31.331 --> 00:57:35.830
with.
And when you get into a really big conflict and you feel like your stock,

1082
00:57:36.130 --> 00:57:40.030
the third thing that you have to do is really make sure that you establish that

1083
00:57:40.031 --> 00:57:43.330
shared goal,
a vision.
Keep already mining everyone.
Why are you there?

1084
00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:44.530
Why are you in this room?

1085
00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:48.730
We are trying to solve that particular problem and just kind of stick with it

1086
00:57:48.731 --> 00:57:49.211
because I,

1087
00:57:49.211 --> 00:57:53.050
if everybody has the same goal and everybody agrees with that same goal and they

1088
00:57:53.051 --> 00:57:57.940
can remove their ego,
I think that's a big thing from the um,
from the situation.

1089
00:57:57.941 --> 00:58:01.780
Do we might be able to come out with something.
And um,
the,

1090
00:58:01.850 --> 00:58:05.830
the fourth one is just,
then you have to construct the hybrid solution.

1091
00:58:06.130 --> 00:58:11.130
So brainstorm a lot of eraser could ideas and select the best ideas from the

1092
00:58:11.201 --> 00:58:15.730
four colors and try to see,
can I put the green one with the Red One?

1093
00:58:15.731 --> 00:58:20.170
Could I put the blue one in the yellow one and we put some up some ideas and

1094
00:58:20.171 --> 00:58:22.900
some assets in the book.
You can use metaphors,

1095
00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:27.340
you could use different kind of a creativity idea and that we can put up

1096
00:58:27.341 --> 00:58:31.330
together and basically the idea is last night compromise,

1097
00:58:31.630 --> 00:58:35.680
let's not choose one idea to another house to figure out a way that we can

1098
00:58:35.681 --> 00:58:39.940
ascend all this,
get all disagreement together,
but listen to one another,

1099
00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:44.890
create a bond and learn how to communicate with another and then come out with a

1100
00:58:44.891 --> 00:58:48.610
better solution.
Jeff.
Oh,
well

1101
00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:54.950
<v 0>thank you.
Let's finish up here.
So what's the point?
Take a higher point of view,</v>

1102
00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:59.300
right?
It's hard,
isn't it?
It's hard with all of the,
the,
all the anger.

1103
00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:02.090
It's hard to get to a higher point of view.
But do you,
have you noticed people,

1104
00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:05.090
adults are starting to do that now they're starting to say,
you know,

1105
00:59:05.390 --> 00:59:08.300
even though I might be a little bit on this side of the center line,

1106
00:59:08.330 --> 00:59:10.010
the people who are a little bit on the other side is settle.

1107
00:59:10.011 --> 00:59:13.100
I make a lot of sense.
We can have a conversation about that.

1108
00:59:13.370 --> 00:59:15.770
And finally I want you remember the digraph hypothesis,

1109
00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:18.710
which is probably what they'll remember.
How my tombstone,

1110
00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:20.180
out of all the stuff I've done in my life,

1111
00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:22.010
the amount of innovation and organization

1112
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:25.490
<v 4>produces is inversely related to the number of stupid PowerPoint slides or</v>

1113
00:59:25.491 --> 00:59:29.790
elaborate process to high ground.
It makes about innovation in the,
in the old,
uh,

1114
00:59:29.810 --> 00:59:33.470
words of Phil Knight.
You just have to do it.
So I want to take us first.

1115
00:59:33.471 --> 00:59:36.190
I want to thank you for having us here.
I want to take a second.

1116
00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:39.500
It takes some questions if we could.
I know we're a little over time,

1117
00:59:39.501 --> 00:59:43.730
but I want to take questions because I know that this is a,
a very country,
uh,

1118
00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:48.590
a very,
uh,
counter intuitive view of how innovation works.

1119
00:59:48.591 --> 00:59:52.130
And what we didn't talk about here,
I took it out of the slide deck is we,

1120
00:59:52.131 --> 00:59:54.470
I did a number of,
uh,
uh,

1121
00:59:54.710 --> 00:59:58.490
we did a lot of analysis on the stock market is what it came down to starting in

1122
00:59:58.491 --> 01:00:01.700
1993 more effectively in 2000 in 2010.

1123
01:00:01.970 --> 01:00:05.570
And we started looking at these kind of indicators for contrarian,
uh,

1124
01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:10.580
points of view and what happened with the organizations that had a high scores

1125
01:00:11.211 --> 01:00:12.320
in these opposite areas.

1126
01:00:12.321 --> 01:00:15.770
It turns out that they outperformed everybody else in this growth index that

1127
01:00:15.771 --> 01:00:17.810
we've talked about that to almost no one's beat.

1128
01:00:17.811 --> 01:00:21.140
I think we've only lost with like a half a dozen times over the years.

1129
01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:24.650
So the notion is it's more than just a typology or a style.

1130
01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:28.760
There's really sort of an analytical engine underneath that.
So with that,

1131
01:00:28.761 --> 01:00:30.830
let's take some questions.
So push back please.

1132
01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:35.100
<v 1>Cute.
So here in the office were broken up between floor.
Yup.</v>

1133
01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:38.880
And those correspond to the different verticals that we support.
Yup.
Um,

1134
01:00:38.881 --> 01:00:41.760
across North America,
um,
on my floor,
um,

1135
01:00:41.761 --> 01:00:45.240
there's a lot of innovation that happens because we have a lot of freedom to

1136
01:00:45.570 --> 01:00:50.010
pitch an idea to pitch a project and run with it.
And I'm wondering,

1137
01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:54.180
given your hypothesis and the studies you've done,

1138
01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:59.420
how can leaders or owners of projects best identify these opposite colors?

1139
01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:03.800
Um,
to best,
I guess to make the best team?

1140
01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:08.240
<v 4>Yeah,
I think that the easy answer to that is see what people do under stress or</v>

1141
01:01:08.241 --> 01:01:12.700
duress.
And that's was that kind of throwaway slide I had.
But if,

1142
01:01:12.810 --> 01:01:17.060
if you've got somebody who's primarily a sage,
they're going to be extroverted.

1143
01:01:17.061 --> 01:01:19.820
They're going to be highly interactive.
So when they have a problem,

1144
01:01:19.850 --> 01:01:23.900
they're going to consult other people.
Right.
When you've got somebody who's a,

1145
01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:26.330
who is an athlete,
when they get a problem,

1146
01:01:26.331 --> 01:01:28.580
what they'll do is they'll shut other people out there.

1147
01:01:28.581 --> 01:01:32.000
The opposite of team people that take a lot of ownership and they'll,

1148
01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:33.620
they'll get rid of things in their life.

1149
01:01:33.621 --> 01:01:37.520
You'll notice it's like spring cleaning and they'll focus on one or two things.

1150
01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:41.480
They're very goal oriented.
When you're looking at somebody who's um,

1151
01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:42.770
who's an engineer,

1152
01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:46.910
they'll want to go back and look at the data and they'll think sequentially

1153
01:01:46.911 --> 01:01:51.380
about the data and they'll think about sort of combing through where the error

1154
01:01:51.381 --> 01:01:53.660
was and how to appreciate how to fix the air.

1155
01:01:53.870 --> 01:01:55.490
And if you've got somebody who's agreeing,
they'll talk.

1156
01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:59.300
What you'll see them do is look for escape routes.
They're kind of wiggly.

1157
01:01:59.330 --> 01:02:01.730
Does this make sense?
Because they're very imaginative.

1158
01:02:01.731 --> 01:02:04.730
They know how to tell a tale and interesting way and they'll try and escape.

1159
01:02:04.731 --> 01:02:06.350
So when I look at people,

1160
01:02:06.351 --> 01:02:09.650
one of the things I pay close attention to is what do people do when they're

1161
01:02:09.651 --> 01:02:11.780
stressed out?
Does this make sense to you?

1162
01:02:12.110 --> 01:02:14.060
And if you really want to make things successful,

1163
01:02:14.061 --> 01:02:17.000
I think the big thing is what we constituted success.

1164
01:02:17.001 --> 01:02:19.980
So one of the things I noticed in places like Google is people when they do a

1165
01:02:19.981 --> 01:02:22.830
small experiment or high lakes is successful because it's very,

1166
01:02:22.890 --> 01:02:25.920
it's a very artist organization.
The real question becomes what?

1167
01:02:25.921 --> 01:02:28.110
How does that make it into something that's scalable?

1168
01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:31.800
And the irony of Google is what,
and this is sort of the hard truth of this,

1169
01:02:32.070 --> 01:02:34.890
you have all these different businesses,
how many make money?

1170
01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:39.100
How many of the businesses make money?
It's already filing us.
Yeah,

1171
01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:40.560
I don't think we don't know.
Right?

1172
01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:45.090
And the notion is those are places that have effectively engage the reds and the

1173
01:02:45.091 --> 01:02:47.670
blues,
right?
So there's gotta be a place,

1174
01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:51.270
and this was the problem when I was young in my,
it was a,
I was an advisor,

1175
01:02:51.271 --> 01:02:53.400
was called applied integrated systems at apple.

1176
01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:57.000
The problem with apple in the beginning of days was it was very much like here,

1177
01:02:57.180 --> 01:02:59.310
but they couldn't figure out how to make money and they couldn't figure how to

1178
01:02:59.311 --> 01:03:03.390
get quality sorted out.
Just make sense.
So when jobs came back,
what did he learn?

1179
01:03:03.391 --> 01:03:07.350
He learned how to make money and get quality sorted out.
So this is the issue of,

1180
01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:11.130
it can be successful,
but to be successful all the way through the cycle,

1181
01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:13.410
you have to look for these different types.
Now there's a,

1182
01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:16.350
there's a place in the book you can go and take the assessment.

1183
01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:18.900
There's all kinds of material online.
If you go to,

1184
01:03:18.901 --> 01:03:22.980
if you go to a enough atrium.org or [inaudible] dot com there's tons of stuff I

1185
01:03:22.981 --> 01:03:24.960
think I've written over the years,
like 800 articles.

1186
01:03:25.290 --> 01:03:29.100
You know a lot of books and there's a lot of tools on there and no one,

1187
01:03:29.101 --> 01:03:31.520
all of her bother you.
But the notion is if you want to do something more with,

1188
01:03:31.521 --> 01:03:36.240
if there's a way to do that with,
there's a card game.
Yeah,
I could give some,

1189
01:03:36.270 --> 01:03:37.710
I have some card games.
If you want a car,

1190
01:03:37.770 --> 01:03:40.690
I'll give you a card game when we're done here and what's fun about the car
game?

1191
01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:44.100
Just ask a person to pick a card and tell me what your insanely great at and

1192
01:03:44.101 --> 01:03:47.250
people are pretty self aware.
They'll go,
I'm insanely great at this.
Go Great.

1193
01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:50.790
That's great.
Have someone else pick a card.
You're the opposite.
Okay.

1194
01:03:50.791 --> 01:03:53.190
The two of you are now going to work on this.
Now here's the challenge.

1195
01:03:53.191 --> 01:03:56.010
The real challenge cause we do this everyday in the innovation labs,

1196
01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:57.840
some of the biggest innovations that people write about,

1197
01:03:58.110 --> 01:04:01.830
the biggest challenge is keeping the conflict constructive.
Right?

1198
01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:05.130
And I put it to you this way or what I call big Jeff Days and little Jeff days,

1199
01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:08.700
big Jeff days.
I'm very open to constructive conflict.
Little Jeff days.

1200
01:04:08.701 --> 01:04:10.500
You ever get in that mood where you're like,
Oh God,
I can't,

1201
01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:13.200
I can't deal with this person today.
Now I'm,

1202
01:04:13.201 --> 01:04:15.720
and I'm not rude and I'm not going to fight in a negative way.

1203
01:04:15.721 --> 01:04:19.690
I'm just going to disengage.
I'm going to say today,
today,
you know,

1204
01:04:19.770 --> 01:04:23.610
there's a lot stuff going on in my life and I love you and I want to work with

1205
01:04:23.611 --> 01:04:28.380
you.
But today I'm taking a holiday.
I'm,
I'm getting off the grid today.

1206
01:04:28.410 --> 01:04:30.090
So part of it is knowing to do that.

1207
01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:34.470
I think it's also good life skill when you have a partner,
right?
Someone else,

1208
01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:41.370
he's so,
uh,
you talked a lot about the power of tension and the creative power of

1209
01:04:41.371 --> 01:04:43.090
constructive conflict.
And,
uh,

1210
01:04:43.110 --> 01:04:47.720
I think most people would agree that America is in a heightened state of tension

1211
01:04:47.790 --> 01:04:49.500
and divide it sure is.

1212
01:04:49.501 --> 01:04:53.850
So I'm curious what you would recommend or how can we harness this tension

1213
01:04:53.851 --> 01:04:56.370
productively?
I think,
I think,
uh,

1214
01:04:56.670 --> 01:04:59.370
it's sort of the opposite of the bell curve.

1215
01:04:59.790 --> 01:05:04.110
I think what's happening is actually twofold.
First of all,

1216
01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:08.550
I think the conflict that we're having is a conflict that we've needed to have

1217
01:05:08.551 --> 01:05:09.900
since the 1980s.

1218
01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:14.430
And the way I would characterize the conflict is when I looked at the,

1219
01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:15.420
before the election,

1220
01:05:15.421 --> 01:05:18.900
I was at one of the big government agencies to giving this talk.
Um,
it's,

1221
01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:22.060
I'm not trying to be political,
I'm trying to illuminate something here.
Um,

1222
01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:25.540
and I said,
I thought that Trump may very well when the election,

1223
01:05:25.541 --> 01:05:27.480
which of course was contrary to every set.
And they said,
why?

1224
01:05:27.481 --> 01:05:32.481
And it's thinking about Kurt who got blown out after the Oh oh eight recession.

1225
01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:34.840
There were,
there were four groups that got blown out.

1226
01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:38.320
The first group of young people,
you guys got blown out.
It was bad.

1227
01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:41.950
It's really bad.
The second was old people who are on retirement.

1228
01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:46.750
They got blown out and I,
the penny drop when I was at,
uh,
uh,

1229
01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:51.780
I walked by a Bernie rally here on campus and I'd never seen young people with

1230
01:05:52.301 --> 01:05:56.500
old people before.
This was like,
and I pay attention.
I'm one of those guys,

1231
01:05:56.501 --> 01:06:00.790
pays a lot of attention to incongruities and went,
wow,
well think about it.

1232
01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:03.640
Those are two groups that are one end of the bell curve.
They got blown out.

1233
01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:07.990
The other groups,
they got blown out where people of color,
all right,

1234
01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:09.370
think about all the,
all the,

1235
01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:13.450
the groups in the United States and a lot of those groups didn't vote.

1236
01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:18.300
They disengaged,
right?
Look at the numbers and then I need you to think about,
um,

1237
01:06:18.490 --> 01:06:21.430
people who look like me,
who are from neighborhoods like where I'm from.

1238
01:06:22.090 --> 01:06:24.190
And they'd been downwardly mobile since about 83.

1239
01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:28.750
And the notion is there real economic power,
you know,
their lack of education,

1240
01:06:28.751 --> 01:06:31.570
their mortality rate,
look at anything right now and those numbers.

1241
01:06:31.990 --> 01:06:35.380
And they were really mad out of all of those groups,

1242
01:06:35.590 --> 01:06:40.420
only one of them voted to make sense and they voted big.
Right.

1243
01:06:40.570 --> 01:06:42.880
So when we start looking at the numbers,
what I,

1244
01:06:42.910 --> 01:06:47.440
what I looked at was who's actually going to act,
which is innovation questions.

1245
01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:48.320
It's making sense to you.
Yeah.

1246
01:06:48.550 --> 01:06:52.480
So now the opposite of that is how this will come together is you start looking

1247
01:06:52.481 --> 01:06:54.850
at the middle of the bell curve and you draw a line.

1248
01:06:55.330 --> 01:06:57.040
What's happening is reasonable people,

1249
01:06:57.041 --> 01:07:00.760
which constitute about the 80% of the middle are starting to talk to each other.

1250
01:07:00.970 --> 01:07:02.710
So I think about being in a business school,

1251
01:07:02.711 --> 01:07:06.520
business school is filled with a lot of University of Chicago people,

1252
01:07:06.521 --> 01:07:09.520
very conservative economic,
they read the Economist every day and the journal,

1253
01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:12.610
it's a little right for me,
you know,
and then there's other people in the school,

1254
01:07:12.611 --> 01:07:16.000
you know,
read the,
you know,
read the Times every day.
Bloomberg,
everyday,

1255
01:07:16.001 --> 01:07:18.160
little left.
I read the post,

1256
01:07:18.161 --> 01:07:21.520
I'm kind of down that sort of that guy down the middle.
But,

1257
01:07:21.521 --> 01:07:24.910
but the notion is you're starting to see those people come together.

1258
01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:28.330
The majority is this making sense to you?
And they're starting to say,

1259
01:07:28.331 --> 01:07:31.090
we're going to have to take care of some of these things that we haven't taken

1260
01:07:31.091 --> 01:07:32.690
care of.
So there are issues,

1261
01:07:32.830 --> 01:07:36.670
there are social issues and there are economic issues.
And both of those issues,

1262
01:07:36.910 --> 01:07:39.940
I believe what you're starting to see is that come together.

1263
01:07:39.941 --> 01:07:44.941
I think what'll happen is this will be horribly painful for the next 18 months

1264
01:07:44.981 --> 01:07:49.090
for both sides.
Nobody is going to win this,
but it's a,
it's a,
it's a kitchen.

1265
01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:52.720
It should have started as a kitchen discussion and it's now a fight that's kind

1266
01:07:52.721 --> 01:07:55.990
of calming down.
That's my interpretation of what's happening.

1267
01:07:56.380 --> 01:08:01.360
And I think at the end of this,
and then this is cause remember conflict,

1268
01:08:01.361 --> 01:08:04.720
even if it's not constructive,
will often result in innovation.

1269
01:08:05.020 --> 01:08:09.610
I think we will have to get to a new place is that somebody's following this.

1270
01:08:10.070 --> 01:08:12.370
So that's my take on it.
But I,

1271
01:08:12.371 --> 01:08:17.000
I can imagine being young and seeing this ring side,
it's,
it's,
uh,

1272
01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:21.820
it's not any,
and it's,
and it's when people compare this to,
uh,

1273
01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:26.900
just drop the comparisons to Hitler or to Watergate,
these,

1274
01:08:26.930 --> 01:08:29.240
this is a whole different animal.
And,

1275
01:08:29.241 --> 01:08:32.930
and I think a lot of those metaphors or analogies are don't work.

1276
01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:35.900
I think we're looking at a world that's connected both vertically and

1277
01:08:35.901 --> 01:08:36.680
horizontally.

1278
01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:40.190
And I think the horizontal connections are so much stronger in your generation.

1279
01:08:40.191 --> 01:08:44.270
I think it's going to be very different.
Thank you.
Anyone else?
Yeah,

1280
01:08:47.570 --> 01:08:48.350
<v 5>yeah.
Um,</v>

1281
01:08:48.350 --> 01:08:52.610
what's your perspective on the historical cycles of innovation?

1282
01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:53.870
Um,

1283
01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:58.760
even in terms of nostalgia as an example this year when all this turmoil people

1284
01:08:58.761 --> 01:09:02.030
are looking back to the 1980s,
things like that,

1285
01:09:02.630 --> 01:09:03.790
what do you think about as the deck?

1286
01:09:04.030 --> 01:09:08.650
<v 4>Yeah,
I'd like to say that I don't think they exist,
but I do think they exist.
Um,</v>

1287
01:09:09.430 --> 01:09:14.290
here,
here's,
there's is a very famous book written at the end of the 18 hundreds,

1288
01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:18.730
um,
by Oswald Spangler and Spangler.
Basically,

1289
01:09:18.731 --> 01:09:20.260
it's a book's called the decline of the West.

1290
01:09:21.130 --> 01:09:25.570
And Spangler is this German academic who basically gets it.
He's really,

1291
01:09:25.810 --> 01:09:27.400
he starts showing what's going to happen.

1292
01:09:27.401 --> 01:09:30.610
And what's amazing is he predicts the first world war and the Second World War.

1293
01:09:30.970 --> 01:09:32.950
And the reason it predicts him is he understands the cycle.

1294
01:09:32.951 --> 01:09:36.790
So he's looking at cycles and economies happen in cycles.
So,
um,

1295
01:09:36.850 --> 01:09:41.110
so the part that I would say I disagree is that we're in a very different

1296
01:09:41.111 --> 01:09:45.970
accelerated age with all of this horizontal,
what I call longitude connection,

1297
01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:49.360
the network world,
Nile for Neil Ferguson's new book,
you know,

1298
01:09:49.361 --> 01:09:52.840
the square and the tower,
right?
That stuff.
And I think that's true,
uh,

1299
01:09:52.930 --> 01:09:54.670
at least to some degree,
I think the other,

1300
01:09:54.671 --> 01:09:56.710
but the other thing is human nature's human nature.

1301
01:09:57.130 --> 01:10:01.360
And what happens in human nature is you develop a,
a theory of,
of,

1302
01:10:01.361 --> 01:10:05.710
of a new theory of governance.
And over time that theory,

1303
01:10:06.250 --> 01:10:09.040
uh,
decays into the very thing that tried not to do.

1304
01:10:09.041 --> 01:10:13.030
This is what vapor wrote about.
1984.
This is what Orwell wrote about.

1305
01:10:13.180 --> 01:10:16.750
The animals are all gonna be equal and then baby come Stalinist right.

1306
01:10:16.751 --> 01:10:21.010
Does this make sense to,
so yes,
I think there is something to cycles.

1307
01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:24.270
I think predicting when people start predicting how many years they're going to

1308
01:10:24.271 --> 01:10:27.310
be like the Russians do or how big you're going to be,

1309
01:10:27.370 --> 01:10:31.000
then I think it gets a little iffy.
It my making sense.
So,

1310
01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:34.480
so in summary,
yes,
I think there are cycles,

1311
01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:38.260
but I think the cycles are a little less predictive than people think they are.

1312
01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:41.830
Did I answer your question?
What do you think?
Cause that's my question.

1313
01:10:41.831 --> 01:10:42.664
What do you think?

1314
01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:46.800
<v 5>I think I think that when innovation happens for a few years,</v>

1315
01:10:46.801 --> 01:10:51.801
people accept that all this change happened and then maybe calm down for a few

1316
01:10:52.590 --> 01:10:56.070
years because they're riding the wave of the changes that took place.
You know,

1317
01:10:56.071 --> 01:10:57.270
technology birth.

1318
01:10:57.610 --> 01:11:00.940
<v 4>Did you read?
Um,
the woman's name is Jackson.</v>

1319
01:11:00.941 --> 01:11:03.520
She's the CEO or not CEO,

1320
01:11:03.521 --> 01:11:06.010
the president of Rensler polic technique.

1321
01:11:06.011 --> 01:11:08.260
Did you read her book on innovation cycles?

1322
01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:11.410
She basically point something out that I think is very damning.

1323
01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:13.920
She said that most of the wave,

1324
01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:19.250
which your company was built on was w sort of ended in the mid nineties and that

1325
01:11:19.391 --> 01:11:23.340
what we've been doing is iterations of that wave for a long time.

1326
01:11:23.341 --> 01:11:26.040
And I know that when people start talking about like collaborative open

1327
01:11:26.041 --> 01:11:29.580
innovation networks,
I worked on apple net,
which became iTunes.

1328
01:11:29.670 --> 01:11:32.610
I mean that's what,
84 85 right?

1329
01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:36.200
You start thinking about what people talk about is now the innovator.

1330
01:11:36.201 --> 01:11:38.130
IOM was built 10 years before we work.

1331
01:11:38.610 --> 01:11:43.200
So the notion is when you start looking at where the genesis of things are and

1332
01:11:43.201 --> 01:11:46.620
you pick like,
you know where this is really fun music,
right?

1333
01:11:46.650 --> 01:11:50.460
I grew up in the 70s and people went to high school in the 70s and you know,

1334
01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:51.930
people say,
well,
you know,

1335
01:11:51.931 --> 01:11:54.720
what happened to you give all the music genres that people listen to now and

1336
01:11:54.721 --> 01:11:56.940
they all happened in the 70s is this making sense to you?

1337
01:11:57.210 --> 01:12:00.300
So the nineties the nineties for technology,
seventies for music,

1338
01:12:00.301 --> 01:12:04.950
the issue becomes at what point is that long cycle done right?

1339
01:12:04.951 --> 01:12:07.270
And usually it has to be disruptive to be done.
But you're,

1340
01:12:07.410 --> 01:12:10.530
I think you're seeing disruption.
I come back to what I talked about.

1341
01:12:10.531 --> 01:12:12.170
Maybe you weren't in the room.
We talk about the structure,

1342
01:12:12.230 --> 01:12:15.390
disruption of institutions.
You know,
marriage is different now.

1343
01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:18.870
Religion is different now.
Um,
what work is,
is different now.

1344
01:12:18.871 --> 01:12:21.630
Universities will soon be different now trust me,
they will.

1345
01:12:21.690 --> 01:12:25.470
Madison will be different now.
And I think those are more subtle long cycles.

1346
01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:30.320
Anyone else?
One more,

1347
01:12:32.710 --> 01:12:36.170
kind of going back to what you're talking about with like contrarion indicators

1348
01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:40.340
and how you saw that these companies far out performed any others.
Yup.
Um,

1349
01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:43.250
I was wondering if you had any insight is how we can distill that down and take

1350
01:12:43.251 --> 01:12:45.810
that back to like our teams put that to work for us.
Um,

1351
01:12:46.220 --> 01:12:51.030
I think what I would recommend is I'd read the book,
right?
And I'd say,
uh,

1352
01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:54.700
one of the things that,
uh,
that the book will give you clues about this,

1353
01:12:54.701 --> 01:12:57.320
some of this,
obviously I can't open up the whole can of worms here,

1354
01:12:57.680 --> 01:12:59.120
so I don't want to over commit to something.

1355
01:12:59.510 --> 01:13:03.860
But you'll notice that there are list of attributes that could easily be turned

1356
01:13:03.861 --> 01:13:06.290
into key indicators that you could follow.

1357
01:13:06.530 --> 01:13:09.100
And then I'd ask you to do some of your own research to say,

1358
01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:12.810
well if you get some of these contrary and key indicators,
and I think it's uh,

1359
01:13:13.370 --> 01:13:14.780
pardon?
Can you answer that?
Yeah,

1360
01:13:15.510 --> 01:13:16.343
<v 3>thank you.</v>

1361
01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:19.500
<v 2>Okay.
I can speak a little bit toward that.
So</v>

1362
01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:24.810
we wanted to see if the culture differences in the four quadrants,

1363
01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:28.230
the four colors would,
it would appear all sign per company performances.

1364
01:13:28.231 --> 01:13:30.840
So we looked through 20 years of data.

1365
01:13:31.350 --> 01:13:35.700
But what's interesting to me when we looked at the companies who do well over

1366
01:13:35.701 --> 01:13:36.900
there,
it's again,

1367
01:13:36.930 --> 01:13:40.800
it's like they do well red and green and then blue and yellow.

1368
01:13:41.010 --> 01:13:44.310
And when four of them are showed up at the same time,
that's better.

1369
01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:47.340
So you can be very good at blue can,
you can,

1370
01:13:47.610 --> 01:13:50.080
you can be very good at craney couldn't be the in red,

1371
01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:53.760
but when you're good at both your value,
it's multiplied.

1372
01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:57.570
That's what I'm trying to say.
So what does that mean?
When I saw the data,

1373
01:13:57.610 --> 01:13:58.021
the data,

1374
01:13:58.021 --> 01:14:02.140
the hard data actually is telling me that you have to have your basics down.
So,

1375
01:14:02.141 --> 01:14:05.110
and this is specialty good for you guys for Google because you,

1376
01:14:05.111 --> 01:14:09.000
you were at based on algorithm,
so your reds out to be very,
very strong.

1377
01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:13.960
But then on top of that you have to these loose process,
these,

1378
01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:16.220
you know,
groups of people who,

1379
01:14:16.221 --> 01:14:19.360
who can take it to the next place to look at future growth.

1380
01:14:19.570 --> 01:14:23.930
But it is in this combinations.
I think in particular more,
uh,

1381
01:14:23.950 --> 01:14:27.450
from my research look much more relevant and much,

1382
01:14:27.451 --> 01:14:31.600
much more vibrant than the youth.
The blue and yellows have to hold it together.

1383
01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:34.840
But for me,
the,
what I saw,
mostly it's the red and green.

1384
01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:39.190
<v 4>I also think if you go back and look at some of the earlier books that I've
done,</v>

1385
01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:44.290
there's a lot of clues in there about very specific things to measure.

1386
01:14:44.620 --> 01:14:46.000
Obviously it gets a little more,

1387
01:14:46.210 --> 01:14:50.410
we're making this overly simple to make the concept accessible cause there's a

1388
01:14:50.411 --> 01:14:53.560
lot of interdependencies.
There's a lot of complexity under the hood,

1389
01:14:53.561 --> 01:14:54.970
just like Your Business,
right?

1390
01:14:55.270 --> 01:14:59.440
It's some of the stuff is of great interest to Wall Street and not to normal

1391
01:14:59.441 --> 01:15:02.230
people and some stuff's not more interest to people or governance.

1392
01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:05.620
If you read the book and the next step is maybe read this book leading

1393
01:15:05.621 --> 01:15:08.440
innovation,
which I wrote,
I don't know,
15 years ago,

1394
01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:11.320
then I think the interesting thing would be that if you have some,

1395
01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:12.490
you run it for a while,

1396
01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:16.030
I'd be interested to see how I'd be interested to hearing from you what happens,

1397
01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:18.880
what you find right.
That would be of interest to me,

1398
01:15:20.410 --> 01:15:23.260
making stone soup has a really great formula to it.
Yeah.

1399
01:15:23.290 --> 01:15:27.970
There's a thin book that I wrote that we wrote for jump starting in the labs.

1400
01:15:28.150 --> 01:15:28.983
I did,
if you know this,

1401
01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:31.750
the University of Michigan as a certified professional innovator program,

1402
01:15:31.751 --> 01:15:33.010
which we created,
right?

1403
01:15:33.011 --> 01:15:36.010
So that's the first certificate program they ever did with the school of

1404
01:15:36.010 --> 01:15:37.000
Engineering.
Right?
Uh,

1405
01:15:37.150 --> 01:15:40.010
we wrote a book for it called making stone soup and it's uh,

1406
01:15:40.450 --> 01:15:45.310
I think it's like $7 and eight at your,
you know,
on the android.
It's all,

1407
01:15:45.470 --> 01:15:48.640
but it's,
it's a,
it's a great way to start.
That's a great point,
Lindsey.

1408
01:15:48.641 --> 01:15:52.870
It's a great way to start CEC,
CEC.
We start so that,
like I said,

1409
01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:56.860
the challenge of this is,
it's so easy that people think it's like a,

1410
01:15:57.160 --> 01:15:59.800
a disc test or a Myers Briggs test.
The challenges,

1411
01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:01.600
if you start going down that road,

1412
01:16:01.780 --> 01:16:05.470
what I'm suggesting to you is you start by a beginner,
you read as a beginner,

1413
01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:08.110
but if you want to go all the way down the road,
I mean,

1414
01:16:08.111 --> 01:16:11.200
there's something you could do also with just the resources that are publicly

1415
01:16:11.201 --> 01:16:14.290
available,
I can get a lot more sophisticated,
a lot faster.

1416
01:16:15.790 --> 01:16:19.930
Anything else?
Thank you.
I appreciate you Hagen out here to the end.
I,
uh,

1417
01:16:20.170 --> 01:16:22.450
and good luck with all this and thanks for having us out.
