1
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.910
[inaudible].

2
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.060
<v 0>So Shannon,
I thought maybe we could begin with,
um,</v>

3
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.310
how you got started on the investing journey.

4
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.340
<v 2>Well,
my father was in the advertising business for most of his life and he</v>

5
00:00:28.341 --> 00:00:31.370
recommended to me that I buy some central airlines with some money I've made the

6
00:00:31.371 --> 00:00:34.820
summer and that construction job.
So I bought 200 chairs.

7
00:00:34.821 --> 00:00:39.030
I've said earlier lines at Tudor Court for,
for a $50 and a,

8
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.630
I met the chief executive officer whose name was Lamar mommies and uh,

9
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.770
he,

10
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.130
they cared about parents' house one time it had dinner and my mother's dog bit

11
00:00:49.131 --> 00:00:54.120
his wife on the nose.
They didn't leave,
but,
uh,
anyway,
shut.

12
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.240
He was a good sport and resilient.
Uh,
so,
so that was starting.

13
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.440
How funny they were.
The stock went up.

14
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.250
It was acquired about a year and a half later about central airlines been bought

15
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.620
by frontier airlines for $14 a year.

16
00:01:06.621 --> 00:01:10.400
So 2020 5 cents and turned into $14 pretty quickly.

17
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.390
And I think that I just thought this beats sitting out in the sun carrying

18
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.730
forums around and I was hooked for life and that was its success to start with.

19
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.060
I had a lot of failures after that,
but kind of figured it all out eventually.

20
00:01:23.061 --> 00:01:25.280
Maybe I have,
I don't know,
why

21
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.530
did you start to invest in here?
When I bought little sidebar here,

22
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.070
some not by stark and was hearing something about and start getting a very good

23
00:01:34.071 --> 00:01:35.330
investment system.

24
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.210
Cause you hear it from people that don't know what they're talking about.

25
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.700
We take a while to figure out who didn't know what they're talking about and who

26
00:01:40.701 --> 00:01:45.530
didn't.
But uh,
you know,
I'm always fascinated by it and always interested in it.

27
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.680
And uh,
you know,

28
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.360
kid ran about myself up and my wife took me to this event every year called art

29
00:01:53.361 --> 00:01:57.500
about town and you had bid on paintings and I would have been on paintings for

30
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.160
less than I figured the frame that it was less than the various,

31
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.050
the frame rail that was a value investor.
And so,
so,
uh,
they would say,

32
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.430
well did you make money?
Then?
I said,
no,

33
00:02:07.431 --> 00:02:11.510
I never saw there was a written written down as a penny.
They're all horrible,

34
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.770
but they said some cheap frames.
Wow.

35
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.420
I think I'm somewhere in the mid seventies.

36
00:02:20.421 --> 00:02:25.421
Y'All just started a banking or brokerage or more for this from Carl Snyderman

37
00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:30.290
didn't Hickman and a,
I was a syndicate manager.
I did the new issues.

38
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.050
I don't get the new shoes and try to get the from end of the deals.
And then,
uh,

39
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.910
I left there and you don't want to start my own firm,

40
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.530
which I call row and company investment bankers,
life banker,
investment bankers,

41
00:02:42.531 --> 00:02:45.020
life brokers.
Really we're just a brokerage firm.

42
00:02:45.021 --> 00:02:48.890
And then the little investment banking,
but not much.
And then,
uh,

43
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.070
I did that and trade for the firms account.

44
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.150
It may a little money and then in 1985 and decided to start up fun to share the

45
00:02:56.361 --> 00:02:57.141
joys,
that short selling,

46
00:02:57.141 --> 00:03:01.000
which I was doing a lot of because the skyline of Dallas,

47
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:05.360
it is pure cranes like it is here now.
But,
uh,
yeah,
there was,

48
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.870
see through buildings everywhere and I figured something bad was gonna happen.

49
00:03:07.871 --> 00:03:10.460
And so,
you know,
I started short selling

50
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.410
<v 0>Hawaii shot selling stocks,
real estate,</v>

51
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.100
<v 2>well stocks and the bank stocks,
real estate stocks,
most state related stocks.</v>

52
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.400
And what was the thesis that the thesis was?
It was,

53
00:03:22.401 --> 00:03:25.280
it was a terribly overbuilt and there everybody was going to go broke because I

54
00:03:25.281 --> 00:03:29.650
was absolutely right on.
And they did.
And,
and so,
uh,

55
00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.530
I wouldn't say that was fun,
but it was good to be right.

56
00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.170
The fact that I'd say my money away to the things barely broke down and made

57
00:03:39.171 --> 00:03:41.700
some great buyers and she shows,
you know,

58
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.610
every dark cloud has a silver lining kind of deal.
So I could have done,

59
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.070
it doesn't matter which side you're looking at it.

60
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.870
<v 0>Do you think getting the timing right was important with the chart settings?</v>

61
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.640
<v 2>Well,
of course it was.
Sure.
And,
uh,
you know,
in,
in,
uh,</v>

62
00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.840
you know,
what I found though was it,
you buy stock and it goes down.

63
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.220
The MACI loses her mind that she put up and it goes down with some more,

64
00:04:08.221 --> 00:04:12.280
you have a smaller problem and you don't worry about it.
Maybe shorter start,

65
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.800
he goes up,
you're just sick.

66
00:04:13.801 --> 00:04:16.980
You can't even breathe because you can have remembered in Las petitions.

67
00:04:16.981 --> 00:04:20.820
I mean you can die and be incapacitated and lose every dime,
every dime you have.

68
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.090
Uh,
there's a,
there's an overpriced stock service I took for a while,

69
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.430
but he's in the regulatory Microsoft and they said they ever come along and say

70
00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.550
hope for better exit buoyant.
Well hell,
they lost all their money

71
00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.360
so it's not a not a good solid medicine.

72
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.840
When I was doing it and the interest rates were high,

73
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.200
real rates were high and brokers call was about the prime was so have you put up

74
00:04:49.531 --> 00:04:53.880
treasury bills and then short and stocky get the brokers call on the short

75
00:04:53.881 --> 00:04:56.880
position,
we would mean that you'd be up 15% when he started,

76
00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.380
we was pretty good and now course you have to pay to borrow.

77
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.940
So your dad when you started.
So there's a big difference there.

78
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.590
I didn't figure that out until later,

79
00:05:04.591 --> 00:05:09.500
but that's why it was boy loves and attracting and taxes.
Also a tactic.

80
00:05:09.501 --> 00:05:11.160
We're also at the same,
they're the same.

81
00:05:11.161 --> 00:05:16.161
Taxes on dividends and interest in short sales and short swing province and

82
00:05:16.291 --> 00:05:19.680
longterm province,
everything was taxed the same so it didn't matter.

83
00:05:19.681 --> 00:05:22.000
And so that was one,
another little added factor.
Right.

84
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.260
Plus you really never had to cover.
You could,
you could take the nine and,

85
00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.610
and a and a pair of the trades off,
you know me,

86
00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.830
she put her shirt covered versus the boxers and mini bat back hold on.

87
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.970
Long position,
a short position,
all it 25,

88
00:05:35.971 --> 00:05:38.200
six of shares and he never had to be days.

89
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:43.010
Could you explain that a little bit Chad for us?
Sure.
You could not,
you get,
uh,

90
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.910
you know,
you could be shorting versus a boxer,
the boxer stock,

91
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.760
you would borrow the shares,

92
00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.240
the jeep and the Jeep Bosh and delivering against your short position or hold

93
00:05:54.241 --> 00:05:58.340
them against your,
your position.
So you would would've covered but not recovered,

94
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.520
but everything be blocked out and you can just keep the tax money.

95
00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:06.400
And that was outlawed in the tax roll of 1985 and that was,

96
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.150
that was made a little bit better business then.

97
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.110
<v 0>So you were getting paid to bottle the taxes for a favorite book.
Yeah.</v>

98
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.310
And the market was not fairly valued according

99
00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.880
<v 2>do you know,
and a lot more retail investing then,
then there was right.</v>

100
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.580
Unless for years,
so not as smart.

101
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.880
So why did you give up shots selling?
Well,
it becomes all consuming.
You know,

102
00:06:27.881 --> 00:06:31.510
you,
you're,
you're,
you take,
if you feel better about it as you get older,

103
00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:36.490
but it hurts worse.
And,
uh,
my mother kind of typically,

104
00:06:36.491 --> 00:06:38.470
you know,
we're just trying to always trying to be optimistic about things.

105
00:06:38.471 --> 00:06:42.180
And she said,
well,
no,
she said the no worry,
I'm sure something terrible happened.

106
00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:48.520
The only met her.
But
that was sort of the idea.
You know,

107
00:06:48.521 --> 00:06:50.110
you're looking for bad outcomes all the time,

108
00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:54.400
which a happier life if you're looking for good outcomes.
Right.

109
00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.530
<v 0>And so after you get up shots selling,
um,</v>

110
00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:01.420
you moved on to finding small local companies in Texas.

111
00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:02.650
Can you talk to us a bit about that?

112
00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.650
<v 2>Well,
actually in the,
in the time that,
uh,
Korean airlines,</v>

113
00:07:06.651 --> 00:07:10.280
I also own small company there turnarounds when they hit three and then four

114
00:07:10.281 --> 00:07:13.610
airplanes.
So I miss him about the airline,

115
00:07:13.611 --> 00:07:17.270
doesn't listen and they something in about advertising this a little bit bigger

116
00:07:17.271 --> 00:07:21.500
than my father.
And so I was sort of set up on some things on those lines and,

117
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:22.993
and uh,

118
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.850
I found that one kind of door leads to another and everything's kind of

119
00:07:28.851 --> 00:07:33.200
connected.
We're all connected.
And so between my father,

120
00:07:33.201 --> 00:07:36.680
and you have much more friendly toward now than it was,

121
00:07:36.681 --> 00:07:38.960
where's the lie unfortunately.
But,
uh,

122
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:45.490
you could kind of get a feel for different businesses.
So,
uh,
in,
in,
in the,

123
00:07:45.491 --> 00:07:48.690
in the shorts would eventually turn into lungs that I bought back.

124
00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:54.230
It was short deputy big group in 1991 and then covered 19 and Kevin [inaudible]

125
00:07:54.351 --> 00:07:58.480
91 and then you end up buying it and a lot on it,
uh,

126
00:07:59.090 --> 00:07:59.950
in southwestern Ontario.

127
00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:04.330
<v 0>Very well On.
So when did you buy your first chairs of [inaudible]?</v>

128
00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:08.020
1974.
1974.
The baton is bottom of mine.
I still have them.

129
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.560
You still have the same?
Oh,
no,
no,
no.
Understand.
Years.
I sold most of it,

130
00:08:11.561 --> 00:08:15.820
but the stuff is very valuable.
Uh,

131
00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:18.260
would you know,
uh,
how,

132
00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:21.870
how much the revenues have compounded by a stock price is competitive base into

133
00:08:21.871 --> 00:08:26.590
bought it.
I always probably 27% of it he age 20% of it.
30 plus.

134
00:08:26.591 --> 00:08:29.980
This is amazing,
but what,
what was it about southwest that got your attention?

135
00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:32.930
<v 2>Armies.
He's the same guy that was a hint of central airlines.
Right?</v>

136
00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:36.300
And so I felt like I knew him then and uh,

137
00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:39.520
it was obvious to me that they were doing something better,
faster,
cheaper.

138
00:08:39.521 --> 00:08:43.090
They were flying between Dallas and San Antonio and Houston on a tight schedule

139
00:08:43.091 --> 00:08:47.500
and doing it for not much more than the price of a bus ticket to the traffic was

140
00:08:47.501 --> 00:08:49.690
expanding.
They were stimulated the market and it's growing.

141
00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.280
And they did that everywhere.

142
00:08:51.281 --> 00:08:55.350
They went all over the United States and now they're gone abroad.
You know,

143
00:08:55.351 --> 00:08:57.840
it's a,
it's a better story.
They have one airplane that they fly.

144
00:08:57.841 --> 00:09:01.500
It is through an engine out that's on,
it's on the news indictment.

145
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.150
It was a

146
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:08.580
once in a lifetime kind of deal and did an airline.

147
00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:12.900
It's very needle because there's only really in there Joan loss and all these

148
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.840
years there he runs,
went broke all the time,

149
00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:19.230
but they didn't put their customers first.
They put themselves first.

150
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:22.290
<v 0>That's [inaudible] and their employees,</v>

151
00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:27.820
they treat everybody well right around 15 years ago maybe or a little older than

152
00:09:28.411 --> 00:09:30.810
that.
Um,
you change their outlook.
Again,

153
00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:34.710
focusing on companies that can scale new things faster,
better,

154
00:09:34.711 --> 00:09:38.580
cheaper for the customers.
Yeah.
How did this change happen?

155
00:09:38.581 --> 00:09:41.430
And maybe give us some examples.
Well,

156
00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:46.600
<v 2>partner,
you know,
kind of an
odd man out kind of failure.
You know,</v>

157
00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:50.380
it'd be owner stock in a company,
you're kind of a second

158
00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:54.100
right?
Compared to the management.
You know,
you don't,

159
00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.740
they don't always tell you the truth and they're manipulated a year.

160
00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:00.190
But if you think the company's really doing something for the stakeholders,

161
00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:03.820
for the shareholders,
for the customers and for themselves,

162
00:10:03.821 --> 00:10:06.250
you feel a lot better about it.
So yeah,
you feel,

163
00:10:06.251 --> 00:10:09.730
I'd feel better than the mystery of I've invested in a company like that and a

164
00:10:09.731 --> 00:10:13.060
so better,
faster,
cheaper,
and for and not to the customer.

165
00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:17.710
And to the delight of the customer and a B on a scale,

166
00:10:17.711 --> 00:10:21.670
then if it works in another thing that advertising,
I did,
I did this WPP group,

167
00:10:21.671 --> 00:10:24.550
I told you about work.
Martin Sorrell just left.
He got fired.

168
00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:29.830
But he said that word globalization is a misnomer.

169
00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:31.360
That the better word is Americanization.

170
00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.510
People all over the world really want to live the way we do here.

171
00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:39.100
I know you believe that there's something to it.
And uh,

172
00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.220
so this is a success here.
It can be a success elsewhere.

173
00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:47.800
And that's certainly been the case of airlines have been this Starbucks.
It's,
uh,

174
00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:49.430
you know,
Amazon,
you know,

175
00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:53.070
all of these companies operate throughout the world and you know,

176
00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:55.570
he's talking about the law of large numbers.
Well,

177
00:10:55.571 --> 00:10:58.270
how you need to own a stock that has a large number because there are a large

178
00:10:58.271 --> 00:11:03.100
number of people in the world in large number of
square miles to cover,

179
00:11:03.101 --> 00:11:05.500
and you got to get out there before someone beats you to it.

180
00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:07.900
I think these big companies have he age and age now,

181
00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:12.970
and then they can cumbersome opes like they used to be.
Uh,
they're,

182
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:17.890
they're really big and strong and powerful and they just win,
win,
win.

183
00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:22.160
<v 0>Right.
So following up on that chat recently,
I think you wrote about,
um,</v>

184
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:23.970
the necessity of large numbers,

185
00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:28.530
not that large numbers and not just needed to compete but actually succeeded.

186
00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:31.800
Right,
right.
Um,
so can you talk to us a little bit about that?

187
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:34.140
Why do you think large numbers are a necessity?

188
00:11:34.141 --> 00:11:38.580
And maybe give us an example of a company that you think as efficiency going for

189
00:11:38.581 --> 00:11:39.414
it.

190
00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:43.450
<v 2>He talking about Google came,
we,
uh,
uh,</v>

191
00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.180
well all of them really,
you know,

192
00:11:46.181 --> 00:11:49.300
southwest airlines downs is going to Mexico and they're going to the Caribbean,

193
00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:51.620
they're big enough to do it.
And uh,

194
00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:56.740
no would sit aside and that southwest do to them what they did.

195
00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:59.860
I wouldn't say that much and it can happen again.
People are just smarter.

196
00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:03.910
And I think that,
I think that the board compositions have changed.

197
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:08.890
I think that they were,
are more attentive and,
and the kind of doll,

198
00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:11.050
and I have seen how the chief executive officer,

199
00:12:11.051 --> 00:12:14.740
he sits there and acts like a dictator there over and women on the boards of

200
00:12:14.741 --> 00:12:19.210
health I think.
And uh,
there's just more visibility.

201
00:12:19.211 --> 00:12:22.800
It's hard to be off a bit secretive as people used to be.
Right.

202
00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:27.040
I think that governance is better and I think opportunities are better perceived

203
00:12:27.041 --> 00:12:31.250
and investors aren't any smarter.
And uh,
but I think that,
you know,

204
00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.190
the whole situation has improved

205
00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:38.480
<v 0>you.
This stress from efficiency,
a shadow,
any,</v>

206
00:12:38.481 --> 00:12:40.980
any say it like Costco is not just efficient but elegant.

207
00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:46.270
<v 2>Oh Man.
It's great.
It's fun to be there.
Fun to shop there.</v>

208
00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:50.020
You save money,
you get great products,
you get great value.

209
00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.780
See the same people there.
And uh,
I think it's,

210
00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:57.010
I think the shopping is a little bit of an adventure and Jen fun and they put

211
00:12:57.011 --> 00:12:58.720
things in the store and this is going to get you back.

212
00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:03.540
How did you approach Costco as an investment decision?
Did you uh,

213
00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:08.910
well I liked going there as is probably simple as that.
And thrive.

214
00:13:08.911 --> 00:13:12.820
I like it.
Other people probably like it and they do.
Okay.
Uh,

215
00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.810
you want to say money or get good daddy.
You don't care about the brand name?

216
00:13:16.811 --> 00:13:21.490
I mean the,
the uh,
the uh,

217
00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:26.590
right over the kindle one is it,
it's a great,
it's a great,

218
00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:30.310
great style that Caitlyn
and uh,

219
00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:34.270
what I'm losing my mind here,
but yeah,
it's got everything.
Like everything that,

220
00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:39.070
uh,
one time I ended,
it wasn't his investment group and,
and um,

221
00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:43.540
the deal on the dinner we're going to was the person we had the worst bottle of

222
00:13:43.541 --> 00:13:44.620
wine had to buy dinner.

223
00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:49.870
And so I went and I could take a bottle of wine that my wife had picked out from

224
00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:51.580
constellation brands.
I can't remember the name of it,

225
00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:55.900
but it was a 92 on the monitor board or something.

226
00:13:56.590 --> 00:14:01.540
And,
uh,
they way I heard the waitress complaining this one is flawed,

227
00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:06.430
the court has no gun and,
and uh,
and they didn't put it,
he didn't wrap it up.

228
00:14:06.431 --> 00:14:10.870
And Mr Kin folks,
and I know what it is that I can give up is me,
I'll buy dinner.

229
00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:15.430
Then I wrote a letter to Jim Sinegal.

230
00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:20.650
I'd had this horrible experience and,
and uh,
the Galley,

231
00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:25.260
they doctor constellation brands in there against her did again for,
uh,
uh,

232
00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:28.990
concert giving me my money back.
Uh,
you know,

233
00:14:28.991 --> 00:14:31.340
I just made a huge profit on it and,
uh,

234
00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:35.680
bought more stock and I did the same thing to Mcdonald's and talking about

235
00:14:35.681 --> 00:14:37.750
something terrible that happened there.
And I got a form letter back,

236
00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:40.480
sorry for your bad experience.
And then there's nothing,

237
00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:46.380
but you know,
that sort of heroic responses is going over overboard,

238
00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:50.060
bending over backwards to make people happy.
And it's a,

239
00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:54.630
and the customer comes first.
You get ahead and then you go even behind.

240
00:14:56.340 --> 00:15:00.140
So I think,
um,
but when you said customer comes first,
I'm reminded of another,

241
00:15:00.141 --> 00:15:03.140
you know,
another one.
If you're nice characterizations about stage one,

242
00:15:03.141 --> 00:15:05.660
companies teach two companies and stage three companies.

243
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:09.050
And these aren't to do with size of the company or age of the company.

244
00:15:09.051 --> 00:15:13.430
They are with how the company custom stage one,
everything's new.

245
00:15:13.431 --> 00:15:16.250
You're doing something better,
faster,
cheaper for the customer.

246
00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:21.190
Your stock is soaring.
Can you give us examples of each stage?
Well,
uh,
any,

247
00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.650
any,
any little company that takes off southwest airlines has been,

248
00:15:24.651 --> 00:15:27.250
he's going to stage one the whole career.
And uh,

249
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:32.790
stage two is maybe like got Starbucks where they start selling tea and,

250
00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:36.050
and different food and trying to mix up the,

251
00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:38.900
trying to get more money from the same person.
Okay.

252
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:44.270
And a stage three is most airlines and banks and everything else where there's

253
00:15:44.271 --> 00:15:48.590
no question they're out to get you.
So how do you detect this date?

254
00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:53.390
This change between stage two and stage three?
Shy a customer.
So I gave her,

255
00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:54.850
it was obvious,
isn't it?

256
00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:01.010
That's what I think.
So what are the hallmarks?

257
00:16:01.011 --> 00:16:05.780
Shadow for great business like me?
Stage two,
stage one kind of business.

258
00:16:05.781 --> 00:16:08.810
What are the hot,
well,
I would love to find a business.
It was basically better,

259
00:16:08.811 --> 00:16:11.900
faster,
cheaper.
Okay.
On a scale that can be taken globally,

260
00:16:11.901 --> 00:16:15.470
that I'd seen it work in the United States,
the great management,
you know,

261
00:16:15.471 --> 00:16:18.750
I don't know how you'd define that,
but you know what we see it and uh,

262
00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:20.590
some valuation that was,
you know,

263
00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.860
somehow you could think it was reasonable and uh,

264
00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:28.680
know it sounded like that.
I was laughing the other day about that.
Uh,

265
00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:33.440
David Allan Coe song,
you know,
the,

266
00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:34.580
I think your song is perfect,

267
00:16:34.581 --> 00:16:39.290
but you haven't said anything about Mama or trains or being drunk or falling off

268
00:16:39.291 --> 00:16:43.280
the bus or you know,
but there's all the ingredients are there for perfectly,

269
00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:46.760
just like the upgrades are there for perfect stock and you're always looking for

270
00:16:46.761 --> 00:16:50.750
the perfect stock.
Do you do focus on capital intensity at all?

271
00:16:50.751 --> 00:16:53.410
When you look at a paint company and Evelyn intensive,

272
00:16:53.411 --> 00:16:57.110
we have one capital intensiveness how they use their balance sheet.

273
00:16:57.111 --> 00:16:59.620
Is that those things you look at?
Well,
I look at it,
but I,

274
00:16:59.621 --> 00:17:03.070
I presume they know more than 90 days.
I don't,
I'm not too judgmental about.
Okay.

275
00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:06.020
So let's invert that a little bit.
You know,
like college,

276
00:17:06.021 --> 00:17:09.920
Jacobi and Charlie Manga.
So what are some things you want to widen the business?

277
00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:15.320
Well,
if you were still [inaudible],
you know,
he was not doing something better,

278
00:17:15.321 --> 00:17:18.390
faster,
cheaper and things have been worth,
it irritates people.
Okay.

279
00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:21.940
They don't lock it in.
Business is going down and uh,

280
00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.760
it has no point in potential overseas because it has no potential,

281
00:17:24.761 --> 00:17:29.260
potentially the United States.
And it was just,
it'd be perfect inversion.

282
00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:34.100
I either industries or sectors that you would have wide,
well,

283
00:17:34.101 --> 00:17:36.930
I don't think that way.
I think the ones that I would be attracted to you.
Okay.

284
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:40.300
Uh,
and clearly,
uh,

285
00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:45.230
technology that homegrown is kind of interesting because all the money I was

286
00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:49.380
living at home and the parents are getting tired of them and I think they'll buy

287
00:17:49.381 --> 00:17:53.990
houses at some point.
Technology and homework,
home building sector.

288
00:17:55.250 --> 00:18:00.000
You kind of the whole modern home yoga,
the smart home.
Right.
And uh,

289
00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:01.860
yeah,
so I don't know,

290
00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:06.940
this guy that runs up runs up a Pulte political with yes.

291
00:18:09.111 --> 00:18:12.210
Yeah.
And then,
uh,
yeah,
I don't think it matters too much,

292
00:18:12.211 --> 00:18:13.050
but they're all going to have it.

293
00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:17.310
We're the technology finally brought in the house to bring the mass into the

294
00:18:17.311 --> 00:18:18.240
modern age.

295
00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:22.860
<v 0>If I can continue on,
you know,
one of another Charlie monger is uh,
um,</v>

296
00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.180
we learned more from my mistakes then for my successes.

297
00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:27.710
<v 2>I don't know a lot then.</v>

298
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:32.430
<v 0>So after shots selling,</v>

299
00:18:32.431 --> 00:18:35.970
we know once you move to being along and be consumer focused investor,

300
00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:40.160
what are one or two mistakes you've made that you want to talk?

301
00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:45.830
<v 2>I don't want to tell her about it.
And the smaller companies I have,
uh,</v>

302
00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.910
there was a company that was called employer's casualty insurance company that

303
00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:52.360
Worker's compensation is a cheap,

304
00:18:52.361 --> 00:18:56.050
cheap stock and then always been a great company and had a great balance sheet

305
00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:59.950
and the manager wouldn't talk to me and I presented them meant that was so good.

306
00:18:59.951 --> 00:19:03.010
They didn't want to share the information.
And so,
uh,

307
00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:07.780
I bought it and they wouldn't return the phone call and went broke.
Um,

308
00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:10.480
that's a bad example,
a good example of that.

309
00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:16.960
Another one,
you know,
it had some success with southwest airlines several times.

310
00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:21.700
And,
uh,
I got very,
she'd Greyhound buses and even my wife said,

311
00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:25.840
what are you thinking about?
You know,
no one rides a bus and,
and,
uh,

312
00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:30.530
you can see that no one was on the bus because the windows are tinted,
so that,

313
00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:31.420
that was a painful one.

314
00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:33.803
<v 0>Um,</v>

315
00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:38.760
so you probably picked up a lot of trading techniques as a short seller,

316
00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:43.580
looking at price,
volume,
maybe margin calls,
technical.
Um,

317
00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.180
no,
I didn't learn anything.

318
00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:53.300
So do you look at anything other than the customer experience and fundamentals

319
00:19:53.941 --> 00:19:54.960
and you invest in a business?

320
00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:59.040
<v 2>Well,
it's nice if,
if a stock is off for the wrong reason,
okay,</v>

321
00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:03.760
that's always a good one.
Um,
they're panicked about something.
They shouldn't,

322
00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:06.030
this your honors or panic numbers and they shouldn't be panicked over.

323
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:10.100
That's a good reason to do it.
You got a better,
better,

324
00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:11.160
you get a better bargain that way.

325
00:20:11.161 --> 00:20:14.370
But I think in the long term it doesn't make that much difference when you buy

326
00:20:14.371 --> 00:20:15.660
it and you buy the right company.

327
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:21.060
<v 0>So let's focus on that a little bit.
Um,
the valuation date,</v>

328
00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:25.060
how do you approach valuation or setting five,
eight business?
Um,

329
00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:29.130
what is an upper bound you're willing to pay?
How do you like about that?

330
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:34.340
<v 2>I'd want to see how you can pay 10 times what she thought it was initially can</v>

331
00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:37.830
earn and be okay with me.
Uh,

332
00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:40.610
if you had a pretty high degree of competence in it,

333
00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:44.110
because with interest rates where they are and you've got to compete,

334
00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:47.560
think what you're going to do with your money.
And if people say,
well,
mark,

335
00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:51.460
very overpriced and the Nasdaq sales at 33 times earnings or whatever it sells

336
00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:56.410
at,
well,
you know,
what's the yield on a 10 year government?
3%,

337
00:20:56.890 --> 00:21:00.060
that's 33 times earnings and that's the most they're going to earn.
Yup.

338
00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.590
So the companies have a chance to earn a lot more as I think stocks starts

339
00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:07.350
probably cheap route your choices of what you can do.

340
00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:11.240
The money real estate in any matters.
Uh,

341
00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:16.660
farming one,
I don't know what you're gonna do.
Your choices are limited.
You know,

342
00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:20.320
stock is its people.
It's real estate,
it's capital,

343
00:21:20.321 --> 00:21:21.880
it's machines,

344
00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:26.890
it's put together by smart people and working in creating value and growling.

345
00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:29.860
Pretty exciting.
And then exactly all very much now,

346
00:21:29.861 --> 00:21:33.430
but it will end and then thought it through.

347
00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:38.710
<v 0>So once you buy a stock,
ideally you never want to sell it.
You're,
you're right.</v>

348
00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:43.190
You know very well that I'm selling creates two problems,
right?

349
00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:47.440
Um,
the,
the,
the tax problem and the property pay taxes,

350
00:21:47.441 --> 00:21:51.530
then you've got to replace the investment,
right.
You to be right twice,
right.

351
00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:55.740
Are going to do it on a real growth.
So are going to be right once so,

352
00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:59.840
but sometimes you still have to set and sure.
And uh,
do,

353
00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:03.880
do you sell because the situation changes or do you sell also sometimes because

354
00:22:03.881 --> 00:22:08.230
the price runs up too much.
How do you think I've done a little bit of that.

355
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:12.290
<v 2>Uh,
you know,
there's a WPP group,
which I bought years ago.</v>

356
00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:16.820
I sold some in 2001,
so it's not going to crazy price and then get it all sold.

357
00:22:16.821 --> 00:22:19.800
But I kept it and then,
uh,
you know,

358
00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:21.950
I knew Martin Sorrell and watched him,

359
00:22:21.951 --> 00:22:25.200
but then I watch other companies come along like,
like,
you know,

360
00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:30.050
this one and you know,
it was hurting their business very badly,

361
00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:34.670
so I eventually sold it and made a good sales too.

362
00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:37.960
Uh,
that would be a reason,
you know,

363
00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:40.910
the bit is fundamentally changed by technology

364
00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:44.300
or by something that they haven't done.

365
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:48.770
That would be the reason to sell it or the management's banners.

366
00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:51.800
There's something changed that,
you know,
you could see,

367
00:22:51.801 --> 00:22:56.480
but not because it didn't show relative strength or something crazy like that.

368
00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:59.280
<v 0>Shad.
If again,
shift gears a little bit.
Um,</v>

369
00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:02.480
you've spoken about the need for pension funds to,
to,

370
00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:04.590
to be simple and investing process.

371
00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:09.070
And recently there have been incidents of funds that have invested in,
uh,

372
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:13.020
exotic foreign agriculture and things that didn't work out well.

373
00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.990
Why do you think this happens?
Um,

374
00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:18.930
and what can be done to improve this?

375
00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:23.330
<v 2>Yeah,
you'll think of yourself as a star.
I think it helps,
you know,</v>

376
00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:25.300
you have more money coming in and going out.

377
00:23:25.301 --> 00:23:30.301
Hopefully you're already near to buy stocks and your estate grows and you get a

378
00:23:30.911 --> 00:23:32.470
better job,
or you don't get a better job,

379
00:23:32.471 --> 00:23:37.360
but you were spending more sagging mess and you're saving and you grow up in and

380
00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:42.070
you're going to be rich,
old guy or girl or whatever.
And uh,

381
00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:43.150
that's the way it works.

382
00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:47.600
And these patient funds have more money going out than coming in and compound

383
00:23:47.601 --> 00:23:51.470
interest is the eighth wonder of the world.
But when it's working against you,

384
00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:52.933
you can't beat it.

385
00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:56.270
That's what's happening in these pension funds are I promise more than they can

386
00:23:56.271 --> 00:24:00.040
deliver.
And so they're there,
you know,

387
00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:03.710
saying they're making money or they're only 75% funded or something like that,

388
00:24:03.711 --> 00:24:06.900
but really they're going to go broke.
And,
uh,

389
00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:09.680
you can be an alarmist about it.

390
00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:12.770
And yet I got fired as I was the chairman of the Texas pitching to be board for

391
00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:17.370
12 years or something.
And,
uh,
you know,

392
00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:21.710
the Governor Perry finally fire me to get there and I don't listen to tire near

393
00:24:21.711 --> 00:24:24.650
me.
But,
uh,
your compound interest is,

394
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:27.620
is a wonderful thing to have on your side in a terrible thing to have worked

395
00:24:27.621 --> 00:24:32.190
against you.
Do you think that's likely to change in the coming years?

396
00:24:32.191 --> 00:24:34.410
Do we?
Oh,
sure,
sure,
sure.

397
00:24:34.411 --> 00:24:39.411
I don't change like silicon up in the west or the east or wherever it doesn't.

398
00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:42.140
And you know,
they're immutable laws.

399
00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:46.790
I'm going to change their behavior isn't gonna Change.

400
00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:49.970
People get hold of other people's money.
They like it,

401
00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:52.850
it gives him power and they want to be smart.

402
00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:58.100
So she had one of the books I think that has really influenced you has been the

403
00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:03.070
money masters by John Train.
Yeah.
What about the book influenced you?
Um,

404
00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:07.170
and are there,
well,
he's a good money manager and,
and uh,

405
00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:10.880
he understood the distinction is that investors were making their minds.

406
00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:13.520
It's just a good survey and nothing's changed.
It's in.

407
00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:15.680
No one had ever studied investment managers before.

408
00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:18.500
They were just kind of like clerks or something in the became kind of,

409
00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:24.110
kind of a margin than my sometimes,
and it became interesting to people.

410
00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:29.840
But the thing I found interesting.
Yeah,
he's very thoughtful.
And one time I said,

411
00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:32.390
uh,
after standing on these people,

412
00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:37.320
now you investors and all this,
how did you become a growth stock manager?

413
00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:40.670
Like t Rowe price?
And he said that uh,

414
00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:44.240
value investors are really kind of glorified accountants.

415
00:25:44.241 --> 00:25:48.220
They're looking at the gap between their perceived value of what the assets are

416
00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:51.560
going to be worth in its market capitalization and trying to close the

417
00:25:51.561 --> 00:25:55.100
difference.
And then they did,
they got to go buy something else.

418
00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:58.010
So it's a constant turnover process.
Have you ever make a mistake?

419
00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:00.260
You'd pay a lot of taxes and you've lost all your money,

420
00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:04.700
but a growth stock investor,
which he said,
he said that suited his nature.

421
00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:09.140
He really kind of a futurologist and I'm looking at the future and trying to

422
00:26:09.141 --> 00:26:11.780
figure out what's going to happen.
He said that suited his nature.

423
00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:15.020
So that's what he did.
And that makes perfect sense to me.

424
00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:18.320
He didn't requires fewer people.
And he said to me,

425
00:26:18.321 --> 00:26:19.490
write a couple of times in your life,

426
00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:25.920
a lot of your colleagues,
um,
you,

427
00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:30.850
you spoke about the spectrum of investors shots at,
as activists,
investors.

428
00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.740
Do you want to share that?
I was just saying that,
that,
uh,

429
00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:36.620
the short sellers really think they're the smartest people on earth.

430
00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:40.510
They're much smarter than these managements.
And,
and uh,

431
00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:42.590
there's this Martin their risk,

432
00:26:42.591 --> 00:26:47.591
their whole to stash to improve the ride and they are going to broker,

433
00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:49.850
have nervous breakdowns sheet themselves a minute.

434
00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:53.970
I had a good friend who's killed him tell her,
but,
um,
it's terrible lie.

435
00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:59.010
And then the next ones are the uh,
or activists,
investors,
activists.

436
00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:00.840
They think they're smarter than Management Day.

437
00:27:00.841 --> 00:27:03.450
They're going to tell them how to do it.
And,
uh,
so they,

438
00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:06.840
they just didn't get in there and start saying,
do this,
do this,
do that,

439
00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:11.640
and we want to sell the company and we'll make these fees and,
and then,
uh,

440
00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:15.600
the value and the value investors I've already talked about.
But,
um,

441
00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:19.560
and you can rank them all and then the growth stock and Mr just think this

442
00:27:19.561 --> 00:27:21.650
company is smarter than I am.
They know the business better than I need.

443
00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.210
Plus it's a great business and then now get out of it.

444
00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:26.910
And that's how you have a slightly days there.

445
00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:30.360
You want to put yourself on the side where you have an advantage where and they

446
00:27:30.361 --> 00:27:35.070
don't.
So if you perceive that there was a long term teacher for the business,

447
00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:37.080
they're doing something better,
faster,
cheaper,

448
00:27:37.081 --> 00:27:41.460
and for the customer you can buy it at a reasonable price.
And,
uh,

449
00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:46.220
and if you're wrong,
you can sell it.
That's a pretty good deal.
And,
uh,

450
00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:50.440
and that's when one of the things I want to take a chat.

451
00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:54.390
Yes.
I want to get a little personal with this question for you.

452
00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:58.830
So two decades ago you were diagnosed with Parkinson's.
Yeah.

453
00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:02.550
Shortly after which you consider checking on your phone.
Yeah.
Um,

454
00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:07.040
but then you chose not to shut it down.
Maybe you should walk us through that.
Uh,

455
00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:11.190
and also after that you've stated that having Parkinson's has actually made you

456
00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:12.750
a better person.

457
00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:18.870
Can you talk with Michael J.
Fox,
I'm on his board.
He calls up.

458
00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:20.790
Barnes is a gift that keeps on taking,

459
00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:25.260
but I think it makes you a little humble and a more appreciative of what you did

460
00:28:25.261 --> 00:28:29.090
have going ride.
It would make adjustments to it.
But,
uh,

461
00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:33.600
my first reaction was what the hell is going on here?
And I thought,
well,

462
00:28:33.601 --> 00:28:35.430
I'll do everybody a favor and shut the fund down.

463
00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:37.440
And I gave a lot of the money back.

464
00:28:37.441 --> 00:28:41.370
I had some stocks that were hard to get out of their illiquid and dragged my

465
00:28:41.371 --> 00:28:43.800
feet.
And then this is what we also am I going to do.

466
00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:46.410
So my mind in a very good record ever since,

467
00:28:46.411 --> 00:28:49.380
but I had a good record the whole time.
But,
but uh,

468
00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:55.800
yeah,
it's uh,
changed your life a little bit and uh,

469
00:28:56.820 --> 00:29:01.320
you appreciate the things that go your way and things that no you don't worry as

470
00:29:01.321 --> 00:29:04.630
much about was written to Sam.
Uh,

471
00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:10.170
completely pleasant personality is not.
And uh,
uh,

472
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:11.700
but you know,

473
00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:15.510
I think investing is a matter of finding out who you are and where you fit in

474
00:29:15.511 --> 00:29:19.170
the world.
And had all fits together,
you know,
I don't know who's saying it is,

475
00:29:19.171 --> 00:29:21.810
but you don't know who you are and they start going to an expensive place to

476
00:29:21.811 --> 00:29:24.390
find out,
uh,
is true,

477
00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:29.490
but it'd be fit your nature with your investment style and it makes economic

478
00:29:29.491 --> 00:29:31.680
sense and probably do pretty well.

479
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:36.210
And you think of yourself as a stock where you have more coming in than going

480
00:29:36.211 --> 00:29:38.580
out.
And so you did something with the money.
In other words,

481
00:29:38.581 --> 00:29:39.930
you're managing your cash flow,

482
00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:45.330
you're going them in a rich old guy or girl or whatever.
And um,

483
00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:49.110
that makes sense to me.
So I feel like I've got the,

484
00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:53.080
the game is going my way and I feel like that's the way anybody who thought

485
00:29:53.081 --> 00:29:55.720
about it shouldn't go.
And he was in the television,

486
00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:59.890
the stocks under accumulation,
it's bringing out,
it's breaking down,

487
00:29:59.891 --> 00:30:04.030
its lacking support.
I'm selling,
I'm selling,
I sell,
buy,
sell,
buy,
sell his,

488
00:30:04.031 --> 00:30:05.110
pay a lot of commissions and,

489
00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:10.240
and a dealer spreads and lose your money and talk more.

490
00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:15.880
<v 0>So Chad,
before we,
you know,
we open it up to the audience for questions.</v>

491
00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:19.140
I want to ask you one question that we ask all our guests.
Um,

492
00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:22.630
what is some advice you would give the personal investor,

493
00:30:22.631 --> 00:30:25.120
someone who starting their journey today,

494
00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:30.790
maybe investing their first few dollars and trying to make compounding work for

495
00:30:30.791 --> 00:30:31.624
them?

496
00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:38.120
<v 2>The same thing.
Just who are you,
what do you like,
you know,</v>

497
00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:42.350
your a cheerleader
Buer yeah,

498
00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:45.550
you went to home team and where you want the home team to lose and take as many

499
00:30:45.551 --> 00:30:48.860
as you like.
You liked the management,
you think they have a bright future,

500
00:30:48.861 --> 00:30:51.890
you like dealing with them,
they're good people and just said it,

501
00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:52.971
said I and own it.

502
00:30:52.971 --> 00:30:56.360
And think of yourself as a partial owner of a business just like you're the

503
00:30:56.361 --> 00:30:58.010
owner of your entire business,
which is your life.

504
00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:03.230
So that's kind of more above at one on one and combined with a little pop

505
00:31:03.231 --> 00:31:07.190
psychology and my experience and that's what I would do and that's what I'm

506
00:31:07.191 --> 00:31:10.370
trying to do.
That make sense?

507
00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:14.050
<v 0>No,
thank you sir.
Thank you so much.
Fun being here.</v>

508
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:17.140
I think we'll open it up to audience questions and,
uh,

509
00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:19.900
I have a few more in case we have time at the end of the bargain.

510
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:25.450
<v 2>I thank you for your talk.
A that's very,
very inspiring.</v>

511
00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:28.870
So I have question about the large number is a necessity.

512
00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:34.060
I was wondering if you think there's a,
uh,
the risk of,
uh,

513
00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:37.810
you know,
the Anticosti once the company goes large,

514
00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:42.840
like the large member goes terrifying aspect of it.

515
00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:46.040
Easily,
easily

516
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:51.170
the litigation starts coming when they're trying to use the government to

517
00:31:51.171 --> 00:31:54.590
protect themselves from competition or something.

518
00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:58.430
So I don't know,
it'll be interesting.
You know,
I,
I watched,
uh,

519
00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:01.520
than other companies other day talking on television about,

520
00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:04.970
about its issues and problems,

521
00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:10.100
but I think that they did these congressmen and these latest or state

522
00:32:10.101 --> 00:32:12.140
legislators or they're so busy,

523
00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:16.610
they don't have to have to understand anything very clearly.
And uh,
you know,

524
00:32:16.611 --> 00:32:19.160
the business is still good.
It will probably survive and do fine.

525
00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:27.470
And they have the elderly,
they have constituencies that people vote.

526
00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:31.880
And,
uh,
so I don't,
I don't worry about it too much and worry about it some,

527
00:32:31.881 --> 00:32:36.440
but not too much.
It's overrated and that does make sense.

528
00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:38.293
That answers your question.

529
00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:43.070
<v 3>Yeah,
it makes sense.
Next,
you talked about better,
faster,
cheaper,</v>

530
00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:47.480
what is one business that better,
faster,
cheaper,
that you would like to own,

531
00:32:47.481 --> 00:32:50.660
but you don't because of price or whatever other reason.

532
00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:53.930
And I have a second part.
Yeah.

533
00:32:57.420 --> 00:33:00.990
What is something that you owned in the past that is no longer better,
faster,

534
00:33:00.991 --> 00:33:01.920
cheaper and why?

535
00:33:03.730 --> 00:33:04.563
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

536
00:33:05.970 --> 00:33:10.970
<v 2>Or dolls and then they're getting beaten by lots of people now and a</v>

537
00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:19.250
Petsmart,
which started selling very expensive products.

538
00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:24.300
So you saved money but your dog up warehouse doors and build them down and then

539
00:33:26.691 --> 00:33:29.330
more functions in them.
But it was not,

540
00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:32.870
he's got a company with I can do to the dog or new to you or how did it get

541
00:33:32.871 --> 00:33:34.790
tricky?
And,
um,

542
00:33:36.370 --> 00:33:39.780
but really I'm just trying to find the ones that are good and I hold him.

543
00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:46.030
I saw him,
WPP,
which I don't know what I mean.
33 times on a million.
Uh,

544
00:33:47.510 --> 00:33:50.990
the reason was,
was it the competitors on argued bedrooms,

545
00:33:50.991 --> 00:33:55.070
we're doing it better,
faster,
cheaper,
and getting more for the money.

546
00:33:55.071 --> 00:33:56.810
And who you watch,

547
00:33:56.990 --> 00:34:00.810
you watch regular television now and the ads aren't for drugs that,
you know,

548
00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:04.910
the side effects might be that you'll die and crying for your mother.
Uh,

549
00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:09.790
they're just terrible off pudding.
Uh,

550
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.970
and so on the ad that applies to you directly,
did you,

551
00:34:13.971 --> 00:34:16.790
and you only see it's so structured,

552
00:34:17.390 --> 00:34:18.930
didn't tell you somethings you want to hear him.

553
00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:20.270
It seems like a better deal to me.

554
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:26.450
I think I'd also written about Carmax,
which,

555
00:34:26.451 --> 00:34:30.740
which back in the day was excellent pricing.
Right.
But with discoverability now,

556
00:34:31.910 --> 00:34:35.290
yeah,
the advantage is gone.
Uh,

557
00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:39.420
because everybody knows what everybody paid for everything because of the

558
00:34:39.421 --> 00:34:40.254
Internet.

559
00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:41.943
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

560
00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:47.960
<v 3>One last question.
Um,
we had Mr Schwab visit us,</v>

561
00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:52.640
I think about two years ago from Charles Schwab and he talked about how,

562
00:34:52.910 --> 00:34:53.840
in his words,

563
00:34:53.950 --> 00:34:58.950
a Charles Schwab continues to deliver their services to their customers better,

564
00:35:00.231 --> 00:35:04.070
faster,
cheaper.
How do you think about Charles Bob say,
compared to the CTO,

565
00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:04.630
which you

566
00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:08.360
<v 2>[inaudible] heard of Tito?
Yeah,</v>

567
00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:10.790
I got a good price on or I'm ready to get out of it.
But

568
00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:16.130
<v 3>do you think Charles Schwab does better,
faster,
cheaper?
You are in that industry,</v>

569
00:35:16.131 --> 00:35:17.810
so probably you know better about who does.

570
00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:21.260
<v 2>I think that right now the Thoreau prize probably knows better because their</v>

571
00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:25.130
personal growth companies and the Margaret and paying the premium that is

572
00:35:25.131 --> 00:35:27.940
certainly capable of paying for those companies.
You know,

573
00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:32.060
I can remember I was not in the market at that time,
the nifty 50,

574
00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:33.071
you know,

575
00:35:33.071 --> 00:35:38.071
or in duplicable companies that would always be in portfolios regardless and

576
00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:42.630
always grown to now something a hundred times earnings I 1973.

577
00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:45.540
So I think that sort of thing could happen again.

578
00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:50.540
And we have a world 50 world nifty 50,
we're,
we're,
you know,

579
00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:55.530
you don't buy bitcoin woman.
Hell,
Coca Cola stock used to be like bitcoin

580
00:35:57.950 --> 00:36:01.770
or the technology companies are like that.
Uh,

581
00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:06.460
I think that could easily happen.
And I think that,

582
00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:09.480
that these companies can make the,
you know,

583
00:36:09.481 --> 00:36:11.910
they know more about other businesses and I do.

584
00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:15.240
And they can buy them for stock or bond for cash.

585
00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:19.600
Everybody turns into a Warren Buffett,
Ghana,
we,

586
00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:24.780
what do we learn from Warren Buffett?
I mean,
yeah,
he started out with no sound,

587
00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:25.561
you know,

588
00:36:25.561 --> 00:36:29.760
delivering papers and turn that into be the richest guy in the world for a
while.

589
00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:35.190
And,
uh,
what did he do?
He just had an obsession with money and,
and,
um,

590
00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:38.490
there were spinning and this compound and compound and compound it,

591
00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:44.210
<v 4>uh,
Aldi's wonder about nonprofit investments.
Um,</v>

592
00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:49.480
and when I think of buffet dot Kates and lots of lots of tech investments,

593
00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:54.580
um,
you know,
is it in the context of philanthrophy versus giving the way,

594
00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:57.140
what's his actual investment and being able to manage it.

595
00:36:57.590 --> 00:37:02.590
And I always wonder what the thought process is when the rich decide to go one

596
00:37:04.221 --> 00:37:07.520
way or the other.
And I'm just curious to hear your thoughts.

597
00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:09.910
<v 2>Honor,
accumulating money,</v>

598
00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:16.630
<v 4>um,
uh,
philanthrophy or,
you know,</v>

599
00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:21.140
investment and change in the context of larger good.
Uh,
how do,

600
00:37:21.141 --> 00:37:22.760
how do investors think about it?

601
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:27.210
<v 2>Not all the time.
And I don't,
I don't know.
Sometimes I'll,</v>

602
00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:32.160
I'm usually really disappointed by what I discovered about what was really

603
00:37:32.161 --> 00:37:34.640
happening.
I mean,
you know,

604
00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:37.530
people get old and they won't have hospital's named after and they want to

605
00:37:37.531 --> 00:37:41.790
invest in healthcare and the healthcare people are just charging more every year

606
00:37:41.791 --> 00:37:44.670
and it's become too big a burden.
Uh,

607
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.440
not to complain about it,
but,
uh,
yeah,
I think it's an issue,
you know,
die.

608
00:37:50.441 --> 00:37:54.120
We all your money and uh,
you'd rather have,

609
00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:56.940
you do decide what I'm do with it and then that someone else decide what to do

610
00:37:56.941 --> 00:38:00.780
with it certainly turned anyone's going to be better than the government

611
00:38:00.781 --> 00:38:03.720
probably.
I think it was a big issue.

612
00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:08.310
We don't live forever is we all think we will.

613
00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:11.680
Yes ma'am.

614
00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:12.910
<v 4>Hi.
Ah,
I wonder,</v>

615
00:38:12.911 --> 00:38:16.920
what's your advice about the risk controlling for prison?

616
00:38:16.930 --> 00:38:21.930
Any writers don't have much time to investigate what's going on in your market.

617
00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:27.770
<v 2>Well,
you'd beat 99% of investors if you just bought this and p 500 index from</v>

618
00:38:27.771 --> 00:38:32.771
vanguard or fidelity or something like that for most people ought to do and they

619
00:38:33.321 --> 00:38:35.070
wouldn't worry about the individual dies or no,

620
00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:38.910
you put 90% of your money in those index funds and,
and then uh,

621
00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:41.440
play with the other money.
Just saw your play money and have fun with it.

622
00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:44.380
That'd be my advice.

623
00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:50.440
I really enjoy your sort of a three stage model and how companies sort of get

624
00:38:51.201 --> 00:38:55.670
fat and they get lazy and then you know,
get eaten.
Yeah.

625
00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:59.330
One question I have is,
you know,

626
00:38:59.450 --> 00:39:02.180
how frequently the companies that you've purchased,
you know,

627
00:39:02.181 --> 00:39:04.850
turn into a different stage.

628
00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:08.480
Are you obviously you're trying to buy ones that always stay in stage one and

629
00:39:09.350 --> 00:39:13.710
end up in Stage two but are successful in stage one that leads to problems.

630
00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:19.260
It's like when people,
it's just like exactly like a person
and uh,

631
00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:23.460
you know,
at some point,
I mean,
you know,

632
00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:27.390
the company is successful and it wants to do something else and then visuals do

633
00:39:27.391 --> 00:39:29.340
something else that didn't make it money in the first place.

634
00:39:30.350 --> 00:39:33.080
And this is exactly the same thing.
So you want to have,

635
00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:35.880
make enough money so that you're comfortable when you get your needs taken care

636
00:39:35.881 --> 00:39:39.240
of.
But that's a nap probably unless it becomes a game or an obsession.

637
00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:44.940
Uh,
when you're right,
exactly.
It's the same thing as it were a person.

638
00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:49.940
Can I ask a brief followup,
which is in,
in um,

639
00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:52.440
a profile of you from 2016.

640
00:39:52.441 --> 00:39:57.120
You mentioned that you aim to have about 15 stocks in your portfolio at any

641
00:39:57.121 --> 00:40:01.110
given time and you sort of sell off the worst performing one every year and try

642
00:40:01.111 --> 00:40:04.860
to replace it.
And that,
incidentally,

643
00:40:04.861 --> 00:40:09.861
you also mentioned that by concentration only about six of the make up about 70%

644
00:40:10.621 --> 00:40:12.330
of the actual portfolio by value.

645
00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:16.890
Is that a fairly constant sort of performance metrics or is it,

646
00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:19.990
what happened is this is what happened to me,
but I liked it.
Not,

647
00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:25.010
I'm probably about 12 or 13 stocks and most of them are most of the money then

648
00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:27.190
very few stocks.
But um,

649
00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:32.610
you want to be diversified to the point that you got the odds in your favor,

650
00:40:32.611 --> 00:40:36.150
but not to the point that you don't keep up with them.
And

651
00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:40.790
I'm being a little bit more disciplined about it now.
I used to be,
but you know,

652
00:40:40.850 --> 00:40:44.340
it's hard to sell stock in.
Once you have a profit in it,
it's hard to sell it,

653
00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:45.031
pay the taxes,

654
00:40:45.031 --> 00:40:49.140
make up the net worth and bedding dealer spread and make the money back.

655
00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:53.760
So we tend to do some mega companies at low cost,

656
00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:58.230
but you know,
if you want to step out,
you got to sell them

657
00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:04.460
and they got to fit.
Would you really think is happening?
I mean I don't,

658
00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:06.510
I was saying the same thing 10 years ago,

659
00:41:06.511 --> 00:41:09.840
but my portfolio is completely turned over since then.
And uh,

660
00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:14.550
the reason is I have better companies now.
I think,
knock on wood,

661
00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:19.330
<v 5>as companies grow,
the culture is very difficult to maintain.
Right.</v>

662
00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:22.660
Especially when bureaucracy creeps him.

663
00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:27.850
What made you believe that southwest will continue?
Uh,

664
00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:30.430
it's called continue keeping its culture in future.

665
00:41:32.010 --> 00:41:36.950
<v 2>It's culture.
Yeah.
Well,
they've got a good guy,</v>

666
00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:40.550
Gary Keller who was running it and they've always had good chief executive

667
00:41:40.551 --> 00:41:44.750
officers,
but it's,
uh,
it's hard to change a culture.

668
00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:50.480
It's hard to change it for the worse,
aren't changed for the better.
And uh,

669
00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:52.580
you know,
I like to pick on American Airlines,

670
00:41:52.581 --> 00:41:56.720
but it just seems like they invariably do the exact thing that I would've done.

671
00:41:56.721 --> 00:42:00.490
One,
no one would do nine,
changing a reservation.
Southwest,

672
00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:03.830
they let you change them,
change your time.
Marine Airlines,
you have to pay,

673
00:42:03.930 --> 00:42:04.850
buy another ticket.

674
00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:09.590
By the time they tag their penalties and everything else on you.
It was stupid.

675
00:42:09.591 --> 00:42:13.400
I don't understand it.
And uh,
yeah.

676
00:42:13.401 --> 00:42:16.130
So who is your,

677
00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:21.050
is your fidelity to dude's,
to your customer.
And in the shareholders,
you know,

678
00:42:21.051 --> 00:42:25.810
you've got stakeholders in any business and you got to treat him Ryan and uh,

679
00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:29.090
a lot of the times he's professional management to get hold of these companies

680
00:42:29.091 --> 00:42:32.840
and they think they're the ones to be served that need to serve themselves
first.

681
00:42:32.841 --> 00:42:37.841
And everybody can see that and they react against it and they don't share in the

682
00:42:38.001 --> 00:42:40.670
business and they don't,
they would go on,
which is fine.

683
00:42:40.671 --> 00:42:42.800
I guess they made it makes plenty of money,

684
00:42:42.801 --> 00:42:46.790
but he could have made more and had more fun and contributing to society rather

685
00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:49.400
than
not.

686
00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:54.100
<v 3>If I may ask another question,
uh,
I understand,
uh,</v>

687
00:42:54.101 --> 00:42:59.000
for a short seller is hard also because of you not only need to carry your cc's,

688
00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:03.430
right and you also need to get your timing right at a value investor.
You know,

689
00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:07.660
I guess you're not supposed to time the market and we know it's very hard,

690
00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:11.730
but I keep wondering because uh,
uh,
for example,

691
00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:16.630
right now we are in a late cycle,
a day part of the cycle.

692
00:43:16.930 --> 00:43:21.930
I wonder being understand now we should not timing the market one or if there is

693
00:43:22.031 --> 00:43:24.880
a strategy you will sink a,
you know,

694
00:43:24.881 --> 00:43:28.180
a new master would too slightly differently then,
you know,

695
00:43:28.181 --> 00:43:31.180
the beginning of the cycle.
I don't know,
it's kind of a

696
00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:35.050
<v 2>right.
Another word.
Is the cycle found that out from you?</v>

697
00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:39.070
I don't know that we are now.
Uh,
I don't have any idea.

698
00:43:39.071 --> 00:43:43.330
I think that that a time I've been in the business people,

699
00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:48.360
general public's attitude is much less interested in the stock Morgan and uh,

700
00:43:49.290 --> 00:43:53.230
there are fewer shares or fewer companies that are public.
There are,
uh,

701
00:43:53.650 --> 00:43:55.000
there are better companies now.

702
00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:59.710
