1
00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.010
So I will be talking about teens today.
Um,
thanks for coming.

2
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.740
Over the last month we've watched hundreds of thousands of teenagers organize

3
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.770
and participate in massive rallies across the country.

4
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.780
They've done this in the face of both pain and serious frustration that adults

5
00:00:22.781 --> 00:00:24.520
have utterly failed them on something very,

6
00:00:24.521 --> 00:00:27.010
very basic that's keeping schools safe.

7
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.800
Adults who have been unable to achieve common sense gun control following mass

8
00:00:32.801 --> 00:00:36.400
shooting after mass shooting are now placing their hands and this younger

9
00:00:36.401 --> 00:00:37.234
generation.

10
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.780
But isn't this like the same generation that made tide pods eating tide pods of

11
00:00:43.361 --> 00:00:45.610
viral sensation and recent weeks?

12
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.920
Like how much do you really understand today's young people and how much do you

13
00:00:49.921 --> 00:00:54.850
even care?
For most old people,
the answer is very little.
They don't care,

14
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.700
but you should care like the,

15
00:00:57.701 --> 00:01:00.940
this is the generation that will create massive change in the world over the

16
00:01:00.941 --> 00:01:01.930
next 50 years.

17
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.250
And for us to be able to like teach and influence them as they begin to make

18
00:01:06.251 --> 00:01:08.950
those changes,
it's super important that we understand them.

19
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.510
So if you allow,
allow me to be your guide,

20
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.090
I'd like to tell you a little bit about today's teenager.

21
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.470
But first a little bit about me.
My name is Cory Levy.
I'm in my mid twenties,

22
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.850
and although I'll be using the word we,
while I present this information,

23
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.150
teens consider me a little old.
Um,

24
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.540
so I've worked like years to stay on top of this generation.
Has Jesse mentioned,

25
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.260
um,
I started a company called after school while I was a teenager,
um,

26
00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:36.970
while I was 19.
Um,
uh,

27
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.990
afterschool is one of the largest teenage social networks in the,
uh,

28
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.750
in the u s millions of users who are currently in high school.

29
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.380
I'm also on the board of do something.org,
which is a nonprofit,

30
00:01:47.381 --> 00:01:52.200
a digital platform powering social change for nearly 6 million young people.
Um,

31
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.440
and today I'm going to help you understand this generation a bit better.
So,
um,

32
00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.771
uh,

33
00:01:56.771 --> 00:02:00.340
over the last few weeks I've been interviewing teenagers and with the help from

34
00:02:00.341 --> 00:02:04.210
teams across the country,
I've made a list of 10 things that you,

35
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.130
you probably don't understand,
um,
uh,
today about,
about teenagers.

36
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.080
Um,
so we'll get started.

37
00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.100
The first point is we're heavily addicted to our phones,

38
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.270
but we don't know our phone numbers,
which,
you know,
the first part,

39
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.410
you probably already know.

40
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.340
The second part was what's a little surprising to me and how is this possible?

41
00:02:25.341 --> 00:02:29.570
I've obviously,
you know,
like teams grew up,
um,
uh,
with,
with iPhones and Androids,

42
00:02:29.571 --> 00:02:32.260
with smartphones,
they're,
they're more reliant on them than,
than,

43
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.300
than ever before.
Um,
but teenagers,
they care more about like usernames.
Um,

44
00:02:37.301 --> 00:02:40.780
what's their snapchat name?
What's their Instagram handle?
Um,

45
00:02:40.781 --> 00:02:42.910
they don't really care about phone numbers when they meet new people for the

46
00:02:42.911 --> 00:02:46.480
first time.
They're exchanging these handles,
not like,
Hey,
what's your number?

47
00:02:46.481 --> 00:02:50.800
It's like,
Hey,
um,
you know,
add me on snapchat or,
or,
or follow me on Instagram.

48
00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.390
They don't use iMessage or SMS because mom and dad can,

49
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.970
can,
can have access to that.
They're,
they're texting on snapchat and,
and,

50
00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.930
and an Instagram DM.
And they've probably never,
never,

51
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.620
never used this thing the way it was invented.
Um,
which is probably never,

52
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.270
never,
uh,
use,
use the actual phone.
They've never used an alarm clock.

53
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.980
Um,
they just use,
you use their phone for that and doorbells.
They're like,

54
00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:22.450
what's that?
And that totally unnecessary.
Um,
uh,
and peers,
how,

55
00:03:22.451 --> 00:03:25.630
like two teenagers that,
that I interviewed,
um,

56
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.880
kind of described their connections to their phone.

57
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.330
Teenagers are digital natives.
They don't live in a mobile friendly world.

58
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.840
There are more mobile only generation.
Um,

59
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.330
another person who's a senior in high school said,

60
00:03:37.331 --> 00:03:41.380
parents just don't understand why we move from thing to thing so quickly.

61
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.190
It's not that we have a short attention span is our generation's ability to

62
00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:49.210
filter through information more quickly because we just get bombarded with it so

63
00:03:49.211 --> 00:03:53.200
much.
Um,
this is point number two.

64
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.610
Facebook is lame.
Um,
we love streaks.
Uh,

65
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.410
teams think Facebook is,
is for their grandparents.
It's old,

66
00:04:02.411 --> 00:04:06.520
clunky and invasive.
And in fact,
it's one of the reasons that,
that we,
um,

67
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.830
that we developed our APP after school,

68
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.330
which helps teens connect and share with other students at their high school.
Um,

69
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.110
millions of users.
We have like a matching feature that's connected over a,

70
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.650
that's been used over a billion times with a B.
Um,
uh,

71
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.010
we just released a compliment feature and in the last 24 hours,

72
00:04:24.011 --> 00:04:25.960
like hundreds of thousands of teenagers have,

73
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.760
have like complemented each other with that.
And,
um,
what we've seen with,

74
00:04:30.761 --> 00:04:33.640
with afterschool is that teens use us because we're like a teen only social

75
00:04:33.641 --> 00:04:36.090
network to um,
you know,
come,

76
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.490
come to use the product to,
to uh,

77
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.840
to post things that like they wouldn't post on Facebook or Twitter or Instagram

78
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.920
because there is an anonymous feature to it.
Um,

79
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.860
we also connect teenagers with crisis text line when they are in need,

80
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.880
need of help.
Crisis textline is a teen hotline that you can text seven,

81
00:04:54.881 --> 00:04:58.480
four one seven,
four one.
And uh,
instead of like calling a hotline,

82
00:04:58.481 --> 00:05:00.340
you can text with a trained crisis counselor.

83
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.900
We've connected over 100,000 teenagers to crisis textline via,
um,

84
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.680
via our APP.
Um,
but,
but probably one of the most popular ways that,
that,

85
00:05:09.681 --> 00:05:13.780
that teams communicate is snaps.
Raise your hand if you know what a streak is

86
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.040
about half the audience.
Um,
uh,

87
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.360
teens are like obsessed with snap streaks and a little bit of what a snap streak

88
00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.590
is when you send direct snaps back and forth,
four consecutive days.

89
00:05:26.591 --> 00:05:29.230
So if me and you snapped each other today,
tomorrow,

90
00:05:29.231 --> 00:05:33.850
and the next day we would have had a a three day snap streak and the longer you

91
00:05:33.851 --> 00:05:36.520
go without breaking the chain,
the longer your,
your community,

92
00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.640
the longer your streak is.
And teenagers that I have,

93
00:05:39.641 --> 00:05:44.020
like streaks that have lasted not just weeks or months,
but years,

94
00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.670
um,
uh,
snap rewards these longer streets like special emojis.

95
00:05:48.671 --> 00:05:50.230
So you get a hundred street,

96
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.950
you get like the little hundred Emoji or like a mountain Emoji for like an

97
00:05:53.951 --> 00:05:57.440
extremely,
extremely,
uh,
long streak.
There's,

98
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.430
there's nothing more devastating to a teenager then like losing that streak when

99
00:06:01.431 --> 00:06:03.770
they go off to camp for like a week or a month,

100
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.610
they'll give their snap password to a friend.
Um,
just so they can,

101
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:11.180
they can keep their,
their streaks going.
Um,
uh,

102
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.300
here's how a 16 year old from Brooklyn,
um,

103
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.470
put it streaks are a big part of social acceptance.

104
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.390
Having more streaks makes you feel way more popular.
But he added,

105
00:06:23.391 --> 00:06:25.940
I think,
streaks are a way of showing how many people you talk to.

106
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.450
It's like a score.
If you see your friends have a lot of streaks,
you're like,

107
00:06:29.451 --> 00:06:31.670
Whoa,
that guy or girl knows a lot of people.

108
00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.720
It shows her social status to see how many streaks they have.
Um,

109
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.950
so snap streaks is something that is incredibly popular amongst teenagers and

110
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:43.730
teens also.
Um,
also love,
love,
love Instagram.
Instagram,

111
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.910
Instagram live is particularly popular.
Um,

112
00:06:46.911 --> 00:06:48.920
this allows them to connect with their,

113
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:53.690
with their followers like an in and their audience in real time.
And another,

114
00:06:53.691 --> 00:06:57.680
like a,
an important trend that's popped up is something called a Finsta.

115
00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.670
Raise your hand if you've heard of a Finsta one per two people in the audience.

116
00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:06.360
Um,
offense.
Finsta stands for a fake Instagram.
So teenagers will have,
um,
uh,

117
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.440
two Instagrams set up.
One is their main Instagram,

118
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.560
and that's where their parents,
their siblings,
their cousins,

119
00:07:12.561 --> 00:07:14.000
their friends will follow them.

120
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.730
And then they had a second Instagram called a Finsta,

121
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.040
which stands for fake Instagram.
And that's where they um,
uh,

122
00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:24.950
just have their like top,
you know,
friends,
no parents,
no teachers,
no cousins,

123
00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:29.120
um,
that,
that,
that,
that follow them.
And uh,
yeah,

124
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.970
17 year old student I talked you described for the fence.

125
00:07:31.971 --> 00:07:34.490
So she goes on my fence.
That's the good,
the bad and the ugly.

126
00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:38.270
It's the more multifaceted version of me.
Um,
and you know,

127
00:07:38.271 --> 00:07:41.670
many teams are aware that like potential employers and colleges will,

128
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:42.890
will have access to their,

129
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.850
their maintenance scratch or they create a create the second Instagram called

130
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:51.800
offense stuff to keep,
you know,
some of the information private.
Um,
uh,

131
00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:54.190
a 16 year old I interviewed said,
uh,

132
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:57.740
people in my ige or always doing Instagram lives usually for attention.

133
00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:03.010
Something I do unconsciously is pull out snapchat anytime anything interesting

134
00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:05.450
is happening,
especially around New York City.

135
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:08.810
A majority of my videos on my phone are in stat memories.

136
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:13.070
Anytime I take a video it's for snap for sure.
Just because it's easy to share.

137
00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:16.520
So teens today aren't using like the default camera on their phones.

138
00:08:16.521 --> 00:08:19.910
They aren't using the default apple or Google camera when they want to.

139
00:08:19.911 --> 00:08:21.620
Take a photo,
they're going to snapchat,

140
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:25.400
taking a photo and then saving it and then debating whether or not to send it

141
00:08:25.401 --> 00:08:28.010
out.
Um,
which was,
which was surprising to me.

142
00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.980
Point number three,
we're modern day Shakespeare's.

143
00:08:31.981 --> 00:08:36.560
So teenagers are creating like,
you know,
new language every single day.
Um,

144
00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:40.850
and you know,
we,
we usually start copying them,
uh,
w eventually.

145
00:08:40.851 --> 00:08:44.120
So I want to share like some examples of what teams are saying today.

146
00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:48.090
A M o s c as an acronym it kids are using to,
uh,

147
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:52.310
basically just means add me on snapchat.
Bad means good.

148
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:54.890
Surprising prog means,
Bro.

149
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:59.430
Cringe is when something is like gross or awkward or uncomfortable,
um,

150
00:08:59.431 --> 00:09:02.730
curve or swerve some times is,
is,
is to reject someone.

151
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:07.140
Don't add me.
And he's like,
don't call me out or don't disagree with me.

152
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:11.160
I'm Finna,
it's like I'm fixing to or are Gunna then,
so,

153
00:09:11.161 --> 00:09:13.920
which I just described as the fake Instagram,
um,

154
00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:18.690
goat acronym that stands for greatest of all time.
Gucci,

155
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:23.700
not the brand,
it means good.
Um,
I'm weak or dead is like,
that's so funny.

156
00:09:23.701 --> 00:09:27.500
That's hilarious.
Kms is like the new FML.
Um,

157
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:32.400
savage is,
is,
you know,
bold or strong,
um,
low key.

158
00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.900
Do you want to say something?
Low Key.
It's like secretive and hierarchy.

159
00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.730
That means it's not secretive and it's something that everyone should know.

160
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.870
Plug someone that can provide them with something shipped.

161
00:09:42.871 --> 00:09:44.100
It's not like shipping a product,

162
00:09:44.101 --> 00:09:47.750
but more like a relationship like Alex and Sarah should be shipped off together

163
00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:52.740
means they should be in a relationship.
Um,
straight fire is like good or trendy.

164
00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:57.990
Um,
to describe your friend group.
They're using both squad and fam.
Um,

165
00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:03.260
and uh,
to be bitter is salty.
Um,
straight fires like that.

166
00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:07.970
That's also another,
another term they use for good or trendy.
And then Tsas,
um,

167
00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:12.180
is a term that we're using for something that's like suspicious.
So,
um,
uh,

168
00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:12.660
you know,

169
00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:16.590
you might hear a news reporter and a few months saying like what Facebook did

170
00:10:16.591 --> 00:10:20.400
was,
so sauce,
it's little,
little example.
Um,

171
00:10:20.401 --> 00:10:24.410
so this won't be on the midterm,
but she should,
uh,
uh,

172
00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:29.100
definitely know what teams are the words that they're saying,
but,
but you know,

173
00:10:29.101 --> 00:10:33.310
like team teams are,
are,
are,
are moving beyond words.
Um,
they,

174
00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:37.760
they've made popular in a ray of like new communication techniques.
Um,
uh,

175
00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:42.270
emojis means gifts to express their emotions quickly.
Um,

176
00:10:42.271 --> 00:10:44.640
if you look at any teens tax conversation,

177
00:10:44.641 --> 00:10:47.850
you'll immediately notice the difference with adult tax teams.

178
00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:52.380
Use like tons of Emojis,
gifs,
memes and um,

179
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:56.040
uh,
this,
this,
this makes complete sense there.

180
00:10:56.041 --> 00:10:59.880
They're used to like a flood of information I've been to have had become like

181
00:10:59.881 --> 00:11:00.151
really,

182
00:11:00.151 --> 00:11:03.720
really good at processing quickly and conveying ideas quickly and it's much more

183
00:11:03.721 --> 00:11:06.870
efficient for them to use like an Emoji or a gift and like four,

184
00:11:06.871 --> 00:11:10.480
10 words to describe what they,
what they want to community,

185
00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:15.630
what they want to communicate.
Um,
teens,
they don't get why,
um,

186
00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:16.920
why you are so close.

187
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:21.330
Closed minded teams think that adults are close minded when it comes to things

188
00:11:21.331 --> 00:11:26.320
like same sex marriage,
different sexual orientation,
mixed race dating.
Um,

189
00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:28.350
and this makes sense when you consider their part of the,

190
00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:32.100
like the most racially diverse generation in America,

191
00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:36.620
48% of them are non white.
81% of them have different,
uh,
uh,

192
00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:39.390
have friends that are,
that are,
that are,
that are different race.

193
00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:43.980
And 35% of them have dated,
um,
a different race as well.
One,

194
00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:45.030
one team put it,

195
00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:48.750
most kids like myself and especially ones in urban environments care about the

196
00:11:48.751 --> 00:11:49.830
rights of themselves,

197
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:53.680
but also people that don't look like them or share similar attributes.

198
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:57.440
And that's the reason why we,
we actually go out and protest at City Hall.
He,

199
00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:02.410
it's hard for adults who are stuck in their ways to see when change is
necessary.

200
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:07.990
This one,
uh,
uh,
may or may not be surprising to you,
but gamers are heroes,

201
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:13.180
not geeks.
Teens still love like they're movie stars,
musicians,

202
00:12:13.181 --> 00:12:14.520
athletes,
et cetera.
But,

203
00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:18.820
but who can be a celebrity has changed quite some time.
Um,

204
00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:23.140
they idolize vloggers like Jake Paul who has nearly 15 million youtube

205
00:12:23.141 --> 00:12:27.500
subscribers and videos are being viewed billions of times a month.
Um,

206
00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:31.660
I was lucky enough to be one of his first investors in his management company

207
00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:33.920
when he was 17 years old.
Um,

208
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.130
a fellow entrepreneurs like Elon Musk and Gary Vaynerchuk and Peter Teal and,

209
00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:42.850
and,
and Mark Cuban and Tim Cook and perhaps like the most interesting thing.

210
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:47.060
Um,
uh,
they've made east sports figures.
They're heroes.
Um,

211
00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:51.790
east sports stadiums are being built across the country and Vegas and Houston

212
00:12:51.791 --> 00:12:54.910
and Dallas.
Um,
uh,
and you know,

213
00:12:54.911 --> 00:12:59.020
pro video game players have these massive followings like major corporate

214
00:12:59.021 --> 00:13:03.280
sponsorships and they compete in these huge arenas and make way more money than

215
00:13:03.281 --> 00:13:07.180
like regular regular athletes.
There's a 26 year old named Ninja.

216
00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:12.280
I'm raise your hand if you've heard of Ninja two people.
Um,
as sort of Ninja,

217
00:13:12.281 --> 00:13:16.470
he's,
he's the most popular Gamer on twitch.
Um,
uh,

218
00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:19.990
earns more than half a million dollars a month,
uh,

219
00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:22.870
just by playing video games.
Um,

220
00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:27.070
fortnight is a massive game that's super popular amongst teenagers.

221
00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:32.340
A Ninja just played fortnight in front of 600,000 people viewing it at the same

222
00:13:32.411 --> 00:13:37.090
time.
Drake,
the rapper came on and played with him.
Um,
uh,

223
00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.750
Juju,
Smith,
Schuster,
Steelers foot,

224
00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:44.290
a wide receiver came on and played with him.
Um,
this is something that is,

225
00:13:44.291 --> 00:13:48.190
that is,
that is just the very,
very beginning and continuing to,
to,

226
00:13:48.191 --> 00:13:52.510
to blow up one team.
Put it while athletes and movie stars are still famous,

227
00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:55.400
the idolization of entrepreneurs like Gary,
um,

228
00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:59.020
and youtube bloggers and influencers has completely changed the perception.

229
00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.900
The fact that an entrepreneur came out with a,

230
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:06.100
with a shoe and sold it out to kids and,
and seconds is unreal.

231
00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:09.190
Highschoolers are paying more and more attention to east sports.

232
00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:12.160
And so as the world,
for example,
fortnight or Ninja,

233
00:14:12.161 --> 00:14:14.470
the best player in the world played with Drake Juju,

234
00:14:14.471 --> 00:14:17.890
Smith's Schuster and then a rapper Travis Scott as I mentioned earlier,

235
00:14:17.891 --> 00:14:22.360
had over 600,000 people viewing it,
um,
uh,
at at the same time.

236
00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:27.450
Um,
fashion is still really big amongst today's young people.
Streetwear,
um,

237
00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:31.870
a reign supreme team today differentiate themselves in many ways.
And when it,

238
00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.190
when it comes to fashion,

239
00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:37.750
teens increasingly choose like streetwear brands like supreme and van's over

240
00:14:37.751 --> 00:14:40.600
mainstream.
Brands like Nike,
um,

241
00:14:40.601 --> 00:14:44.440
supreme has this like particular kind of outsider appeal for teenagers.

242
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:47.650
Even though,
you know,
the brand launched in 1994 in New York City as a,

243
00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.290
as a skateboarding and clothing company,
um,

244
00:14:50.291 --> 00:14:52.710
it caters to the skate and hip hop cultures,
but,

245
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.220
and to just youth cultures and in,
in general.

246
00:14:55.221 --> 00:14:58.250
And it's become an absolute obsession for,
for,

247
00:14:58.251 --> 00:15:03.251
for teenagers when teens here about kind of a new shoe or product launch on

248
00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:09.470
Reddit or other social media,
hundreds of teams will line up in New York,
um,

249
00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:11.690
to get their hands on the product before it sells out.

250
00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:13.520
And a lot of teams are entrepreneurs.

251
00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:18.410
They'll buy it and then immediately flip it for,
um,
uh,
extreme markups and,

252
00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:20.960
and big finance is starting to pay attention to this.

253
00:15:20.961 --> 00:15:25.961
The car out group invested in supereme and valued the company at over over a

254
00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:31.100
billion dollars.
We have no interest in working at big companies,

255
00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:34.380
so most teams have,
have very little working,
uh,

256
00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:38.650
very little interest in working for major corporations.
Even,
you know,

257
00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:41.060
tech ones like,
like Amazon and Facebook,
they,

258
00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:44.990
they've seen their parents and older siblings kind of struggle in the workforce

259
00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:49.270
and become unhappy to spite these high paying jobs.
Uh,

260
00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:51.710
teams today are more entrepreneurial than,

261
00:15:51.711 --> 00:15:55.280
than older generations and have like less patients for bureaucratic work

262
00:15:55.281 --> 00:15:58.070
environments and crave more independence.

263
00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:02.440
72% of them said they wanted to start a business one day,
uh,
which is,

264
00:16:02.441 --> 00:16:05.480
which is pretty,
pretty fascinating.
Number nine,

265
00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:08.480
you've left us with a big mess to clean up.

266
00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:13.100
Teams have grown up watching no reports of of a broken political system,

267
00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:16.310
devastating climate change,
you know,
mass shootings at schools,

268
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:20.420
homegrown terrorism and ongoing war.
It's no surprise that like 68% of the,

269
00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:25.250
of this generation feel the u s has headed in the wrong direction and 44% are

270
00:16:25.251 --> 00:16:27.170
worried about the way that things are going.

271
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:32.180
This was more than any other generation,
um,
uh,
interviewed and,
and um,
you know,

272
00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:37.070
lastly,
teens think that that will have a bigger impact than,
than you think.

273
00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:41.330
Um,
it's easy for adults to think that teens today are pretty reckless.

274
00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:46.250
A much of what we read or hear in the media focuses on the,
on the negatives.

275
00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:49.100
I'm like teams trying to pull off crazy stunts on youtube,

276
00:16:49.101 --> 00:16:53.120
which I'm sure you have seen,
or teens infatuation with the jewel.

277
00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:57.050
Raise your hand if you've heard of the jewel one person.
Again,

278
00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:01.550
I'm the jewel is a sleek e-cigarette that can be like used indoors without

279
00:17:01.551 --> 00:17:04.370
attracting attention.
Um,
and don't get me wrong,

280
00:17:04.371 --> 00:17:08.390
like the massive popularity of this jewel of e-cigarettes and something that,

281
00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:11.900
that,
that,
that we should be concerned about.
Um,
but,
uh,

282
00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:16.700
the jewel is something that is a massively popular amongst,
amongst teenagers.
Um,

283
00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:17.001
but,

284
00:17:17.001 --> 00:17:21.450
but these types of behaviors are really not much different than the kind of what

285
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:23.150
we were like in prior generations.

286
00:17:23.151 --> 00:17:27.140
And one team described it as just like the generations before them.

287
00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:30.830
Teams will always want to rebel against the norm.
We're,
we're not worse.

288
00:17:30.831 --> 00:17:33.800
It's just that you see it more because everything is being recorded.

289
00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:36.830
So focusing on these,
these,

290
00:17:36.831 --> 00:17:41.240
these negatives makes us lose sight of the bigger picture with thousands of

291
00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:45.350
hours of kind of observing teams has shown me what many studies show is that

292
00:17:45.351 --> 00:17:47.060
today's teams,
um,

293
00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:51.240
they have a strong worth ethic and balance forward thinking with kind of old

294
00:17:51.241 --> 00:17:53.550
school,
traditional values.
Um,
so when,

295
00:17:53.551 --> 00:17:57.390
when adults think about this new generation,
we should be open minded,
teams are,

296
00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:01.920
are,
are,
are multifaceted.
Um,
and,
uh,
you know,
it's gonna,

297
00:18:01.921 --> 00:18:06.000
it's gonna gonna take some time for us to like stick with a name for this next

298
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.740
generation.
But when I asked teenagers,
like,

299
00:18:07.741 --> 00:18:10.860
tell me if you can name your generation,
what would you name it?

300
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:14.010
Here's some of the responses that I got.
You know,
the viral generation,

301
00:18:14.011 --> 00:18:18.930
the founders I generation,
um,
uh,
digital natives,

302
00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:23.430
gen mobile generation,
next,
the connected generation,
um,
et cetera.

303
00:18:23.431 --> 00:18:27.630
So these were some of the names.
These are some of the names that I got when I,

304
00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:30.770
when I asked a bunch of teenagers,
you know,
how would you,
if you can name it,

305
00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:34.680
name your generation,
what would it be?
But regardless of of what they're called.

306
00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:35.460
Um,

307
00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:40.050
I think one thing is really clear and that is that we shouldn't underestimate

308
00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:44.580
today's teenagers.
Like,
yes,
you know,
they,
they use phones in different ways that,

309
00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:45.080
that,

310
00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:48.600
that we probably would have never imagined the idolize these e sports stars that

311
00:18:48.601 --> 00:18:51.450
we've never heard of.
And they can be pretty quirky,
but,

312
00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:54.570
but they're already showing us that they're going to step up and tackle like

313
00:18:54.571 --> 00:18:59.160
major challenges in ways that other generations haven't.

314
00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.070
Last weekend's like march for our lives was,

315
00:19:02.071 --> 00:19:04.920
was one example that was organized by teenagers.

316
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:08.790
It brought over 800,000 people,
um,
uh,
to Washington,

317
00:19:08.791 --> 00:19:13.440
DC and countless more,
uh,
to hundreds of sister marches across the country.

318
00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:18.600
This is more than the inaugural women's March.
The,
the,
the,
the,
um,

319
00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:22.680
the million man march and,
and,
you know,
didn't,
uh,
uh,
what else?

320
00:19:22.681 --> 00:19:26.420
The march on Washington for jobs and freedom,
um,

321
00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:30.720
800,000 was the biggest march ever.
And you know,

322
00:19:30.721 --> 00:19:33.030
today's teams,
they've,
they have energy,

323
00:19:33.031 --> 00:19:37.540
that passion and they have a no nonsense attitude about fixing the problems
that,

324
00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:39.390
that they've,
that they've inherited.

325
00:19:39.391 --> 00:19:42.780
And if what they've accomplished in the last month is,

326
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:47.790
is any kind of indication we old people are in pretty good hands.

327
00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:51.630
Um,
so thank you for listening to these,
these 10 points.
Hopefully you,

328
00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:53.960
you learned a little something today and,

329
00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:58.200
and the 20 or 30 minutes at a time that I had.
Um,
and I'm happy to,

330
00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:02.100
to answer any questions that you have on today's generation of teenagers.

331
00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:06.863
<v 2>Okay.</v>

332
00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:10.620
<v 3>So I know that online bullying is a,</v>

333
00:20:10.621 --> 00:20:15.540
is a kind of uniquely bad problem for this generation and I was kind of curious

334
00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:20.160
what your social network is doing to mitigate that problem.

335
00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:23.150
<v 1>Yeah.
So online bullying is,
is a,
a VR very,</v>

336
00:20:23.151 --> 00:20:27.170
very serious problem for pretty much any big social network.
Um,

337
00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:30.710
one of the things that we do is proactive moderation.

338
00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:34.920
So most social networks do reactive moderation when they,
uh,

339
00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:39.950
when someone posts a message to Twitter or to Facebook,
it gets seen by everyone.

340
00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:44.690
If it is a,
a negative message,
it may get taken down after the fact.
Um,

341
00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:48.850
with afterschool we do proactive moderation.
So someone writes a message,

342
00:20:48.851 --> 00:20:53.080
it has to get seen by moderation in order for it to get seen by others.
Um,

343
00:20:53.081 --> 00:20:57.730
so that's,
that's,
you know,
one of the steps that we take,
um,
uh,

344
00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:00.370
and after school and we hope that other social networks will follow,

345
00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:04.510
which is increased moderation.
Um,
and um,
yeah,

346
00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.070
uh,
what's up in the back,
right.

347
00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:12.040
<v 4>So streaks definitely seems like a pretty ingenious gamification to encourage</v>

348
00:21:12.041 --> 00:21:13.960
more usage and so forth.
Uh,

349
00:21:13.961 --> 00:21:17.290
any other examples of those sorts of gamification elements,

350
00:21:17.291 --> 00:21:21.200
whether a in your social network or others that you've seen and,

351
00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.560
and other social networks?
You know,
obviously likes is

352
00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:27.370
<v 1>something that,
that,
that teens care a lot about.</v>

353
00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:30.580
One of the things that I've noticed is that when a teenager posts up on

354
00:21:30.581 --> 00:21:33.220
Instagram,
they will wait for like five or 10 minutes,

355
00:21:33.221 --> 00:21:37.630
and if it doesn't get some threshold number of likes,
they'll delete the post.
Um,

356
00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:40.180
so,
so,
so likes is something that,
um,
is,

357
00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:45.100
is incredibly important to them.
Um,
uh,
and you know,

358
00:21:45.101 --> 00:21:50.101
snap streaks is probably the best example of gamification that I've seen over

359
00:21:51.611 --> 00:21:54.560
the last,
you know,
several years of following this generation.
Um,

360
00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:59.100
if snap didn't have snap streaks,
I mean I think teams would,
would uh,
use it way,

361
00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:03.430
way,
way less and best friends,
they have another thing called best friends.

362
00:22:03.431 --> 00:22:07.260
I don't know if y'all don't know what snap best friends are,
but um,
uh,

363
00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:08.980
if you just snap someone a bunch,

364
00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:12.850
they'll have a little emoji next to next to that person's name.

365
00:22:12.851 --> 00:22:16.060
And each Emoji may mean that you all are each best friends with each other or

366
00:22:16.061 --> 00:22:17.650
one of you is best if it's a wink,

367
00:22:17.651 --> 00:22:19.940
it's one of you is best friends with the other person,

368
00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.610
the other person is not best friends with you.

369
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:25.990
I'm just snap is probably done the best job of,
of gameification.
And those are,

370
00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:27.860
those are two examples of that.
Thanks.

371
00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:32.900
<v 4>You mentioned that 70% of teens wanted their own business.
If I remember going.</v>

372
00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:37.750
Yeah.
I wonder if this is the related,
uh,
what do they think of colleges,

373
00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:40.000
college debt and nontraditional mutation things?

374
00:22:40.001 --> 00:22:43.240
Do they also think differently than if we were in the past?
I'm sorry,

375
00:22:43.241 --> 00:22:46.680
could you speak so that I had you,

376
00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:50.410
there's so many people have college debt that is basically there's a prognosis

377
00:22:50.411 --> 00:22:52.360
that of people who are freshmen this year,

378
00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:54.700
but the person who would default on student loans are virtually.

379
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.380
So I wonder if students also have some very interesting ideas of like how to
not,

380
00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:02.380
and I've been in data,
maybe do something different for a college education.

381
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:04.380
<v 1>Uh,
um,</v>

382
00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:09.030
most teens are still following that traditional path of going to high school,

383
00:23:09.031 --> 00:23:12.420
graduating,
going to college.
And Corinne is that,
um,
uh,

384
00:23:12.421 --> 00:23:15.630
and then quickly realizing when they graduate that they weren't trained
properly,

385
00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:20.850
gender,
you know,
uh,
uh,
the workforce.
So I don't think we're there yet.
Um,
uh,

386
00:23:20.851 --> 00:23:25.110
I hope one day that we do get there were teams realize that,
you know,

387
00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:29.190
paying $200,000 over the course of four years for,
you know,

388
00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:34.140
random x degree may not mean that they're going to get a high paying job to pay

389
00:23:34.141 --> 00:23:38.730
that off.
Um,
so I think,
uh,
your teams are so,
uh,

390
00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:42.840
they care so much about themselves and their friends that they don't really know

391
00:23:42.841 --> 00:23:46.350
much about.
Um,
uh,
you know,
what that means.
Um,

392
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:50.960
what college means to and what going in debt means.
So,
yeah.

393
00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:53.500
Not yet.
Well,

394
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:56.510
cause you do things a bit difference between a high schoolers and middle

395
00:23:56.511 --> 00:23:59.240
schoolers are they,
they use social media in a similar way today.

396
00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:03.620
So high scores middle schooler is completely different.
Um,
uh,
you know,

397
00:24:03.621 --> 00:24:06.830
some parents don't let their middle schoolers,
you know,
get,

398
00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:10.990
get Instagram or snap chat until they reach a certain age.
Um,
some of the,
the,

399
00:24:10.991 --> 00:24:14.510
the middle schoolers like they're using musically,
um,

400
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:17.990
they're starting their own slime businesses on Instagram or they make slime and

401
00:24:17.991 --> 00:24:21.110
sell it.
Um,
uh,
uh,
middle schoolers are,

402
00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:25.310
I've seen like a bunch of entrepreneurial characteristics.
Um,
but,
but don't,

403
00:24:25.311 --> 00:24:28.610
don't,
don't know them super well,
but,
but,
uh,
but yeah,

404
00:24:28.611 --> 00:24:32.040
I do see pretty big differences from middle school,
high school and college.

405
00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:34.030
In terms of,
of,
of network use.

406
00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:39.160
<v 5>I have heard about the detachment from TAC overall is the new trend.</v>

407
00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:43.430
What do you say that it's not a trend for teenagers,
but for all generations?

408
00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:46.620
W what was the trend?
A detachment from technology?
Oh,
did

409
00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:48.790
<v 1>attachment from technology.
So,
um,</v>

410
00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:52.510
I think teens are there are very self aware that they're addicted to their

411
00:24:52.511 --> 00:24:54.940
phones.
Um,
they,
they,
you know,

412
00:24:54.941 --> 00:24:58.450
if you go go to a high school and watch people during lunch,
you know,

413
00:24:58.451 --> 00:25:03.300
like everyone will be like this.
Um,
uh,
yesterday I was with a group of,

414
00:25:03.301 --> 00:25:07.630
of 80 teenagers and we were looking at their snap scores.
Snap score means,

415
00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:11.110
you know,
when I send one stat message,
I get a point when I receive snap message,

416
00:25:11.111 --> 00:25:12.280
I get to point,
uh,
you know,

417
00:25:12.281 --> 00:25:16.270
an additional 0.1 teenager and this was like kind of like the average had over

418
00:25:16.271 --> 00:25:21.130
600,000 points,
which means that the average was like,

419
00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:24.290
you know,
she had a snapchat for a year or two or three or whatever it was.

420
00:25:24.291 --> 00:25:27.940
She was sending 14 snaps an hour,
24 hours a day.
Um,

421
00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:31.870
so I think teens are very self aware of that,
that,
uh,
you know,

422
00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:35.240
that they're addicted to their phones,
but they don't really care like there,

423
00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:37.850
I think when you,
when you go to college,
um,

424
00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:39.900
that's maybe when you start to figure out,
you know,

425
00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:44.280
how do I manage my time differently and how can I be more,
um,
uh,
uh,

426
00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:47.500
productive.
But today's teenagers are,
uh,
uh,

427
00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:50.050
pretty much like this all of the time.

428
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:55.370
What do you think teenagers perception of Vr is today?
Like teenagers,

429
00:25:55.371 --> 00:25:59.780
perception of Vr?
I think some of the like,
uh,
you know,
the longer tail of,
of,
of,

430
00:25:59.781 --> 00:26:03.890
of teenagers are,
are super interested in it.
Um,
uh,
uh,

431
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:07.790
and I think there'll be like the early adopters to,
to the technology,

432
00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:10.500
but you know,
the devices are expensive,
so,
um,

433
00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:14.350
it's kind of tough for them to get their hands on it.
Um,
but,
uh,
but yeah,

434
00:26:14.351 --> 00:26:19.030
I think younger generation generally set those trends and I think,
um,
uh,

435
00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:21.820
VR will,
will be really big,
uh,
amongst soon.

436
00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:24.910
I think there's like a question to the right of you.

437
00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:30.890
<v 5>Um,
I wanted to know a bit more about the after school app and how you think you</v>

438
00:26:30.891 --> 00:26:35.891
want over their trust to post things like you showed us and also like how you

439
00:26:36.171 --> 00:26:39.430
convince them that it's worth their time to spend on the APP.
Yeah.

440
00:26:39.431 --> 00:26:40.264
So the first question,
yeah.

441
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:43.270
<v 1>How we kind of a win win over their trust.
I think,
uh,</v>

442
00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:47.010
we built a product for teenagers.
Um,
most people don't do that.

443
00:26:47.011 --> 00:26:50.050
Most people just build a product for everyone.
Um,
uh,

444
00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:54.380
and so our product was built just for them.
Um,
so,

445
00:26:54.381 --> 00:26:59.160
so they know when they like download the APP that there's a verification
process.

446
00:26:59.161 --> 00:27:02.130
I need to get past this,
a few number of things to kind of prove that they're,

447
00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:05.100
they're a teenager and that they attend that high school.
So there's a level of,

448
00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:07.860
of,
of safety that they feel like when I'm joining this network,

449
00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:11.720
I had to jump through all these hoops to like prove I was a student.
Um,
uh,

450
00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:13.920
and just so I think they liked that.
You know,

451
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:18.630
one high schooler was telling me that they posted some photo on Facebook and it

452
00:27:18.631 --> 00:27:22.470
was like to impress a girl and the grandmother commented like,
Oh my God,

453
00:27:22.471 --> 00:27:27.210
you're so cute.
And I was like,
the last time you used Facebook.
Um,
uh,

454
00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.600
so I think people,
uh,

455
00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:32.250
teenagers are attracted to after school because it's just for them and there no

456
00:27:32.251 --> 00:27:35.390
grandparents or no,
you know,
teachers on the platform.
Um,

457
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:39.090
and it's a place where they can just,
you know,
feel comfortable.
Um,
yeah.

458
00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:43.180
<v 5>Yeah.
The other question is like,
how did you convince them it's worth their time?</v>

459
00:27:43.181 --> 00:27:45.610
Like they have a bunch of other stuff going on in high school.

460
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:47.540
<v 1>Yeah.
Um,
that's a great question.</v>

461
00:27:47.541 --> 00:27:51.650
How do we convince them that it's worth their time?
I don't have like,
uh,
uh,
uh,

462
00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:54.900
uh,
uh,
a perfect answer to that question.
Like our,

463
00:27:54.901 --> 00:27:58.790
our apps grown kind of 100% through,
through word of mouth.
I think there's,

464
00:27:58.791 --> 00:28:02.480
there's probably like a really big demand needed for teenagers to be in this

465
00:28:02.481 --> 00:28:05.240
place,
which just them and their friends,
we all had that.

466
00:28:05.241 --> 00:28:09.170
Or at least I had that one when I was growing up.
I had Facebook to go to and,
um,

467
00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:11.150
when I was in high school and there were no,

468
00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:14.820
there were no teachers or parents on Facebook.
It was just me and Mike,

469
00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:17.120
my high school buddies.
Um,
so I think there was,

470
00:28:17.150 --> 00:28:20.960
there was a big demand to create a space where it's just them and their friends.

471
00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:25.100
Um,
uh,
and you know,
snapchat kind of helps a little bit with that,

472
00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:30.320
although parents are,
are joining snap a lot right now.
But,
um,
but yeah,

473
00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:33.090
<v 5>so I think just creating that space just for them.
Yeah.</v>

474
00:28:33.091 --> 00:28:34.230
I just had another question.

475
00:28:34.231 --> 00:28:37.650
Did they say anything about when they think like snapchat's going to die out or

476
00:28:37.651 --> 00:28:41.100
Instagram is going to,
yeah,
so I think,
I think there's,

477
00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:45.610
<v 1>uh,
uh,
you know,
this is kind of the circle that we see where,
you know,
Facebook,</v>

478
00:28:45.611 --> 00:28:49.910
they started with the college audience,
their audience kind of grew up,
uh,

479
00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:53.160
and then they started to build for like a wider audience and then they neglected

480
00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:56.660
their original audience and collected,
you know,
young people,
um,

481
00:28:56.740 --> 00:29:00.940
as they wanted to.
Just gain more users and bigger numbers for,
for you know,

482
00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:03.700
investors and,
and their business.
Um,

483
00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:06.970
so I think we're starting to see a little bit of that right now with Instagram

484
00:29:06.971 --> 00:29:10.660
and snapchat are their parents and their grandparents are starting to join those

485
00:29:10.661 --> 00:29:14.770
platforms that will drive the teams out to something different.
Um,

486
00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:18.280
uh,
team's response to Instagram was,
well,
great,

487
00:29:18.281 --> 00:29:20.140
if my grandparents and parents are on this,

488
00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:22.750
I'm just going to create this second Instagram that they're not going to know

489
00:29:22.751 --> 00:29:27.130
about.
Um,
uh,
with snapchat a little bit harder to do.
Um,

490
00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:32.020
uh,
but with snap new update,
uh,
if y'all are familiar with that,

491
00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:36.340
that's like lower the engagement I imagined massively amongst teenagers and the

492
00:29:36.341 --> 00:29:38.170
ones that I talked to her like,
yeah,
with the new update,

493
00:29:38.171 --> 00:29:40.300
like I don't use the scupper anymore.
I don't,
you know,

494
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:42.400
they're on it less so I'm not sure that was the,
uh,

495
00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:45.730
the best update for snapchat with respect to teenagers.

496
00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:51.060
So how do you prevent the parents or grandparents to come to after school?

497
00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:55.540
It has,
so how do we prevent the old people from,
from infiltrating our network?

498
00:29:55.541 --> 00:29:59.650
Uh,
basically it's a verification process.
So when you log into the APP,

499
00:29:59.651 --> 00:30:03.970
you show us your like school id or verify in a,
in a,
in a certain way.

500
00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:07.180
And a that's similar to how,
you know,
Facebook,
when they started,

501
00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:10.970
you got to verify with your.edu address,
um,
uh,

502
00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:15.670
to prove that you're a college student.
We do,
we do things similar,
so.
Okay.
So,
um,

503
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.840
so compared with this,
I feel that Google is so old.
Do any of your,
uh,

504
00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:25.930
how,
how many,
you know,
usage of your audience actually use Google?
How many,
uh,

505
00:30:25.931 --> 00:30:27.870
actually you just Google it.
Well,
yeah,
they,
they,

506
00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:32.230
they love Google because it helps them with their homework.
Um,
uh,
but,
but yeah,

507
00:30:32.231 --> 00:30:36.610
I'm not,
uh,
uh,
you know,
it's the default web browser,
um,

508
00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:40.050
for them.
So I think they're using it from,
you know,
just probably how,

509
00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:44.050
or at least how I used it in high school.
It's just like,
I want to know anything.

510
00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:47.360
It's okay to go to Google.
It helps me with my homework.
Okay.
Um,

511
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:51.060
and that's probably,
I would imagine what they did tribute Google to most.

512
00:30:51.061 --> 00:30:53.860
It's like the thing that helps me with my homework.
Okay.

513
00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:58.900
What's the one thing that you believe about teens and nobody else believes?

514
00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:03.310
Nobody else believes?
Well,
I think teenagers,
um,
uh,

515
00:31:03.311 --> 00:31:08.310
I think adults think teens are rebels.
And I think that,
that they're,
uh,
uh,

516
00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:12.760
uh,
you know,
too addicted to their phones,
they're going to mess up the whole,

517
00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:15.550
you know,
they're going to mess up the whole next generation.

518
00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:19.000
And I disagree with that.
I think that that,
um,
you know,

519
00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:22.390
today's teenagers are more capable than ever to like make change.

520
00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:27.430
And we're seeing examples of that with this,
you know,
March for our lives,
um,

521
00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:29.690
uh,
demonstration.
Um,

522
00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:33.940
just to say that like a few teenagers plan this massive rally,
um,

523
00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:37.180
you would've never thought that was possible five years ago or 10 years ago.

524
00:31:37.181 --> 00:31:41.470
But with social media,
um,
with Twitter,
with Facebook,
with Instagram,
et Cetera,

525
00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:45.430
we're able to,
to,
uh,
you know,
one kid in a school is able to make this,
this,

526
00:31:45.431 --> 00:31:46.480
this massive change.

527
00:31:46.481 --> 00:31:49.690
So I think this is like the first really big example of this,

528
00:31:49.691 --> 00:31:52.930
but we're going to see so much more of this,
um,
and the days,

529
00:31:52.931 --> 00:31:56.550
weeks and years to come.
So,
uh,

530
00:31:56.551 --> 00:31:59.260
and I imagine if you interviewed a bunch of old people,
they'd be like,
no,

531
00:31:59.261 --> 00:32:03.370
they're definitely not.
But that's one thing I disagree with.

532
00:32:04.030 --> 00:32:07.360
<v 5>I was wondering if you could speak more to like,
um,</v>

533
00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:11.920
the method of collecting this information and if you have any tips of like that

534
00:32:11.921 --> 00:32:14.080
you've learned from,
uh,

535
00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:18.370
methods that worked well versus others that might have been misleading,

536
00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:19.150
if you can,

537
00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:22.690
<v 1>to collect this information about teenagers.
Yes.
Yeah,
so,
so that's,</v>

538
00:32:22.691 --> 00:32:26.350
that's a great question.
Um,
uh,
you know,

539
00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:30.430
teenagers have different personas.
It's,
they're around their friends.
It's one,

540
00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:33.910
one way they act when they're around adults.
They actually incredibly different.

541
00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:38.770
Um,
so it's really challenging to kind of get,
um,
uh,
real truth,
a true,

542
00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:42.470
true information about teenagers.
So a couple of ways we do it as one,

543
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:44.310
and we luckily had this,
this app that,

544
00:32:44.311 --> 00:32:48.110
that millions of teenagers are communicating on.
Two we're able to like,
you know,

545
00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:50.650
pick up trends in language that they're using just from,
you know,

546
00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:53.420
the posts at the,
that they,
that they write.
Additionally,

547
00:32:53.421 --> 00:32:57.120
we have like a bunch of ambassadors across America and,
uh,
we,

548
00:32:57.130 --> 00:33:01.360
we kind of asked them to help us,
you know,
hey,
Texas to your friend texts,

549
00:33:01.361 --> 00:33:05.670
these questions to your friends.
Um,
you know,
take a screenshot of,
uh,
the,

550
00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:08.840
the people you follow,
the people you subscribe to on Youtube.

551
00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:13.340
So we can kind of see like who the WHO,
the big bloggers who are,
um,
uh,
so,

552
00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:16.790
but it's,
but it's really tough.
You know,
sometimes we'll get the,
you know,

553
00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:21.140
adult answers from teenagers and there'll be like,
you know,
a capital letter,

554
00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:23.540
you know,
they'll,
they'll speak,
they'll speak very formally,

555
00:33:23.541 --> 00:33:28.250
and then other times we'll get,
um,
uh,
uh,
you know,

556
00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:30.920
let's see.
I think I may be put,
um,

557
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:33.620
well I guess I capitalized most of the things,

558
00:33:33.621 --> 00:33:36.550
but like the way the kids were applying to me,
you could tell it was like,

559
00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:38.660
they're doing this,
like they're texting one of their friends.

560
00:33:38.661 --> 00:33:43.440
It's like totally incorrect grammar,
misspellings everywhere.
Um,

561
00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:45.230
and that's kind of one of the invitations for like,
all right,

562
00:33:45.231 --> 00:33:48.830
this person's being really real versus if they were typing like real

563
00:33:48.831 --> 00:33:53.210
professional life.
But,
but uh,
yeah,
it's hard.
It's really,
really hard.

564
00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:58.040
Um,
people are biased.
Um,
but yeah,
in short,
a couple of things that we do is,
one,

565
00:33:58.041 --> 00:33:59.540
we use our own platform into,

566
00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:03.410
we have a group of teen ambassadors that will go and ask the questions for us.

567
00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:07.400
So it's a teenager talking to a teen,
not an old person talking to a team.

568
00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:09.410
One question,

569
00:34:09.410 --> 00:34:12.670
what happens after the graduation to the after school accounts for after school?

570
00:34:12.671 --> 00:34:14.910
It happens after graduation is they're kicked out.
Um,

571
00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:19.670
eventually we'll build a college product,
but to keep,
uh,
you know,
uh,
to keep,
uh,

572
00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:22.130
the,
the network,
just high schoolers,
we have to kick them out.

573
00:34:22.131 --> 00:34:26.820
So we've picked out,
yeah,
million plus users.
One last question.
Um,

574
00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:30.660
<v 5>see any,
so you say that there was some Munoz do it too.</v>

575
00:34:30.661 --> 00:34:32.150
Now I'm on the team to juice.
Yeah.

576
00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:39.560
Yeah.
Um,
did you see any like,
tell me,

577
00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:43.880
seeing him kind of agile.
Let's do it.
Thanks.
Ideas,

578
00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:45.143
help me off.

579
00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:48.600
<v 1>Yeah.
So,
so her question was,
um,
you know,</v>

580
00:34:48.601 --> 00:34:52.330
she has an eight year old daughter that's making slime and selling it.
And,
uh,

581
00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:57.150
is this generation,
do I see any ideas,
uh,
from,
from teenagers that are,
are,

582
00:34:57.290 --> 00:34:59.520
are trying to make change?
And,
you know,
I see it every day.
It's,
it's,

583
00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:03.360
it's really cool.
There's,
there's one a 18 year old that I'm working with that's,

584
00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:07.500
I'm trying to make Vegan chicken nuggets to make,
uh,
uh,
you know,
uh,

585
00:35:07.501 --> 00:35:11.160
us all be vegetarians and trying to be like a teen brand and make being,

586
00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:15.510
being a vegetarian.
Cool.
Um,
uh,
and yeah,

587
00:35:15.511 --> 00:35:19.920
so that's just one example of a,
of a teenager being like,
this is a real problem.

588
00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:21.480
Um,
and you know,

589
00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:26.340
he's taking matters into his own hands and trying to create the Vegan version of

590
00:35:26.341 --> 00:35:30.750
Mcdonald's.
Um,
uh,
and,
uh,
I've seen that.
Yeah.

591
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:33.090
Dozens of times.
So it's inspiring.

592
00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:37.770
Thank you all for listening and hopefully you're a little more knowledgeable on

593
00:35:37.771 --> 00:35:38.070
today's

594
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:38.580
