WEBVTT

1
00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:08.630
Yeah

2
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.630
<v 2>[inaudible] I want to do the same thing.</v>

3
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.100
Somebody else,

4
00:00:31.101 --> 00:00:35.690
basically the next generation is going through a smooth experience,

5
00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.030
a fast that growth

6
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.290
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

7
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.920
<v 0>Okay.
This is a quick recap here of where we'd done last 20 years.
And,</v>

8
00:01:33.921 --> 00:01:38.030
uh,
as bill said,
um,
it's been,
um,
it's been quite a journey.

9
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.930
It started 20 years ago.
We've,
um,

10
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.210
a dramatic event in my family when my sister was 22 years old at the time,

11
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.250
uh,
died and,
uh,
she passed away,
um,
and um,

12
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.120
in conditions that were pretty tough because our,
her heart,

13
00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.890
her heart failed and she was pretty upset at what was going on in the world and

14
00:02:00.891 --> 00:02:05.450
she was trying to make a difference.
So a couple of,
a couple of weeks later,

15
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.850
we discovered her writings that she had left behind.
And,
um,

16
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.220
there was a project there that,
uh,

17
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.140
was basically encouraging people to invest in other people.

18
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.480
And I took this project and,
um,
I,
uh,

19
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.630
implemented what was my passion at the time,

20
00:02:26.631 --> 00:02:30.050
was basketball into the project and um,

21
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.030
founded giving back in a,
in with a model that was,
uh,

22
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.650
my mom's Modo.
Every time I was,
uh,
going through the front door,

23
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.220
she kept saying and never forget where you come from.
And,
uh,
that,
um,

24
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.600
started a whole movement,
a global movement in which,
uh,

25
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.550
I went on and try to help kids from all around the world,
um,

26
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.860
to get scholarships,
um,
proof sports,
uh,

27
00:02:54.861 --> 00:02:57.540
basketball and education and,
um,

28
00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.260
to also have the moral that they will never forget where they come from and I

29
00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:06.490
will come back to their communities at some point and give back.
And,
um,

30
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.140
so that led me here in the United States,
um,
in the beautiful city of Newark,

31
00:03:11.141 --> 00:03:16.141
New Jersey and I where we set up the first basketball camps there and whatever

32
00:03:16.811 --> 00:03:21.670
we call social business now we're doing at the time already.
And,

33
00:03:21.671 --> 00:03:24.730
um,
it gave a lot of exporter to these kids and,
um,

34
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.460
some of them are here right now.
And I gave him a lot of opportunities,
uh,

35
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.390
to go through their studies and,
uh,
become,
um,
uh,

36
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.420
go through a different path than what they were supposed to be.

37
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.070
So these kids came from France,
but also,
um,
Senegal and Mali.
Uh,
but cannot find.

38
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.630
So,
um,
Nigeria a little bit everywhere.
And,
uh,
we let her set on,

39
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.080
set up a academies,
um,
in a,

40
00:03:50.081 --> 00:03:54.040
in Africa of sports leadership and social leadership at the same time.

41
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.560
And,
um,
the whole story here is really about the power of giving back.

42
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.590
We think that giving is a wonderful act and just an amazing act and we just feel

43
00:04:04.841 --> 00:04:09.660
that it's not a complete act.
Uh,
when you give a,
you,
you,

44
00:04:09.661 --> 00:04:12.220
you fix situations and um,

45
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.480
and you probably heal and put a bandaid.
Um,

46
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.860
but we think that with the act of giving back,

47
00:04:17.861 --> 00:04:22.861
we can really put the person into a position to come back and empower other

48
00:04:23.291 --> 00:04:26.770
people and keep the chain of life.
And,
um,

49
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.330
and that's really our sustainable way for us to,
uh,
to,
to build any,

50
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.940
any social business.
And,
um,

51
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.440
we never received any grants and we were able to put this all together because

52
00:04:38.441 --> 00:04:42.440
we have our alumni that,
that came back to the program and,

53
00:04:42.441 --> 00:04:46.150
or able to help.
So some of them are here.
And,
um,

54
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.890
I'm going to invite a Cujo Godsey here who was a,
one of the first,

55
00:04:50.891 --> 00:04:54.190
uh,
uh,
student athletes to come to the United States.

56
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.490
And I had a quite a journey,
uh,
coming from,
uh,
some of the toughest areas in,
in,

57
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.700
in France,
and,
uh,
going all the way and working in Wall Street.

58
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.160
Kudrow okay,

59
00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.190
<v 3>thanks.
Bye.
The car.
Uh,
thanks for,
uh,
allowing us to be here today.</v>

60
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.350
It's a pleasure for us,

61
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.710
all of us to be at Google and to share our stories and for being part of the,

62
00:05:17.811 --> 00:05:21.410
uh,
giving back,
um,
group.
Um,

63
00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.060
and program is just a privileged bubble car.
Uh,
as Bible car said,
I'm from Paris.

64
00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.760
Um,
I came to the states about 20 years ago.
Um,

65
00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.430
I actually Babka recruited me to play basketball from,
um,

66
00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.640
from the streets of Paris and to allow me to come here to states and,
uh,

67
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.470
in play high school basketball.
Um,

68
00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:47.000
and from high school I ended up going to college for four years and playing

69
00:05:47.001 --> 00:05:51.860
division one at Fairfield.
Um,
I've been very,
very fortunate,

70
00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.160
uh,
because,
um,
I,
I've,
I've,
I'm,

71
00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:00.690
I'm coming from a very area outside of Paris.
It's a small town with a,

72
00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:05.730
it was majority low income and minority groups and families.

73
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.270
And,
um,
before I came to the states,
uh,
education,

74
00:06:11.271 --> 00:06:15.440
it was never a big part of what I believed in.
I think,

75
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.690
um,
there's always,

76
00:06:17.691 --> 00:06:21.740
you've always been in a class where it is or does an athlete and a who doesn't

77
00:06:21.741 --> 00:06:25.490
work and doesn't do his homework.
What I was me,
uh,
I've only been the wine,

78
00:06:25.491 --> 00:06:30.290
I sort of,
uh,
put school to the side and,
uh,
becoming to the states of,

79
00:06:30.291 --> 00:06:35.050
allow me to,
to,
uh,
you know,
to disregard that and to focus on,

80
00:06:35.051 --> 00:06:39.470
on education.
And so to understand the value of education.
Um,

81
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.410
I was fortunate enough to,
uh,

82
00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:45.930
to get a four year degree at a school in Connecticut.
Uh,

83
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:51.340
from there,
uh,
I've tried to play overseas,
um,
in France,
actually professional.

84
00:06:51.341 --> 00:06:53.600
He didn't work out.
I came back to the states,

85
00:06:53.601 --> 00:06:58.460
went back to New York City and a aid,
um,
um,
and worked at a hedge fund.

86
00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:02.750
Um,
and,
um,
I was there for eight years.
I,
in the meantime,

87
00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:07.880
um,
I received an MBA,
so I was going to school part time,
went to school,

88
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:12.220
uh,
while I was working.
Uh,
and um,
now I'm,
I'm,

89
00:07:12.221 --> 00:07:16.500
I'm actually studying for a Ford y'all side to go to law school.
Um,

90
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.980
and why Bob Carr I mentioned earlier is that it's one thing,

91
00:07:18.981 --> 00:07:22.820
but education is something that you can carry with you all the time and no one

92
00:07:22.821 --> 00:07:25.340
can take away from you.
And he has my dream.

93
00:07:25.341 --> 00:07:28.360
Ultimately he was to come to the states and play in the NBA,

94
00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.510
but things happen and I wasn't able to,

95
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:37.400
but was able to sort of take on the next step of my life and do something else

96
00:07:37.401 --> 00:07:41.300
to education if through work.
Um,
and my journey is not,

97
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:44.630
he's not over obviously,
and I'm even looking to go to,
to laws,

98
00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:45.464
got graduate when I've,

99
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:50.810
I'll be 40 years up every beat of the oldest law students at the school I go to.

100
00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:55.400
Um,
but I think it's just one to,
one of the thing that Anesa Mandela said,

101
00:07:55.401 --> 00:07:59.450
the quote is,
education is the most powerful weapon for change.

102
00:07:59.451 --> 00:08:02.090
And I think this is why we're trying to provide here.

103
00:08:02.091 --> 00:08:06.450
I gave him back his two to give hope to people that whether it's through sports

104
00:08:06.451 --> 00:08:09.970
or through education,
they can make something of themselves and it,

105
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.970
he can change the world.

106
00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:13.850
And what I'm wanting to do and what we're trying to do is to change people's

107
00:08:13.851 --> 00:08:18.740
lives and I want to be a role model for them,
um,
of a mass standpoint.

108
00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:19.930
So,
so yeah.

109
00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:25.350
<v 0>Thank you.
Kojo um,
Cujo is one of the,
uh,
uh,</v>

110
00:08:25.351 --> 00:08:29.460
hundreds of kids that received a scholarship to come to the United States and

111
00:08:29.461 --> 00:08:34.320
took advantage of it.
Uh,
we,
we've had a lot of basketball success stories,
but,
uh,

112
00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:38.430
he stories one of the biggest success story of all because he was able to

113
00:08:38.431 --> 00:08:43.170
capitalize on the education and a and be who he is right now.
So,
um,

114
00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:47.930
that's,
that's also something that we always try to push is,

115
00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:51.750
is to understand that the more we're going to empower people with the education

116
00:08:51.751 --> 00:08:55.800
and the more there'll be inclined to also give back and to know how give back to

117
00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:00.010
their communities.
And,
um,
in that regard,
I'm going to introduce,
uh,

118
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:05.010
Gershwin yabbies La from the Boston Celtics,
um,
who,
um,

119
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:09.690
who also has a pretty unbelievable path that led him not only to the,

120
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:10.770
to the NBA,

121
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:16.040
but also to be our president for the organization here and be a social leader.

122
00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.480
Gershwin is yours.

123
00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.650
<v 4>So first of all,
I want to say thank you for having us today.</v>

124
00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:28.060
It's really important for us and it means a lot.
So my name is Gershwin,

125
00:09:28.061 --> 00:09:30.640
your [inaudible].
I'm a Boston Celtics player,

126
00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:35.500
the best team of the NBA obviously.
But,
um,

127
00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:40.480
today I've,
um,
really try to,
to share part of my story with you.

128
00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:45.520
So I grew up in a France,
a little city nearby Paris.
Um,

129
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:49.060
I always been playing basketball there and then moved to a few of the city in

130
00:09:49.061 --> 00:09:53.470
France to play basketball.
And I'm me in every team that I play.

131
00:09:53.471 --> 00:09:57.370
I'll never be the best player of my team.
I,
uh,

132
00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:01.630
been underestimated a hold on my career,
but,
um,

133
00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:04.130
one day Borkhar gave me call and uh,

134
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:09.070
him and the association really believe in me and the have me through my process.

135
00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:13.990
Uh,
since this day,
uh,
we always be on the phone and he's talking.

136
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:18.990
And then one day I had the chance to go to hell a and a play against the best

137
00:10:19.241 --> 00:10:20.380
players in the country.

138
00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:25.310
And this experience for me is being a big,
big,
big,
um,

139
00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:30.510
part of me being here today cause I had to play against the best player a Honda

140
00:10:30.671 --> 00:10:32.880
stand,
her life is.
And uh,

141
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:37.350
I understand the change that I got to play basketball then he was really a gift

142
00:10:37.351 --> 00:10:40.980
from me.
So as soon as I get back from,
uh,

143
00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:45.310
this trip,
uh,
everything changed in my life.
Uh,

144
00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:49.800
I just understand the things more,
uh,
was thankful for everything.
And,
uh,

145
00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:53.680
since this day Barbara Crane me out a great contact.
Uh,

146
00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:57.940
cause I'm from France and where I grew up,
I grew up in a big family.
Uh,

147
00:10:57.941 --> 00:11:02.020
we sometime we have,
uh,
less,
uh,
so it was really difficult for me.

148
00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:06.490
I grew up with something my friend,
uh,
they fail,
some of them went to jail.

149
00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:10.300
So for me,
uh,
at this point being thankful,

150
00:11:10.301 --> 00:11:13.540
it was just something that I was dreaming,

151
00:11:13.541 --> 00:11:16.780
but something that I in my head every day.
Uh,

152
00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:21.790
he just started being a mission for me and helping the people give back to the

153
00:11:21.791 --> 00:11:26.380
communities.
I mean a lot.
And this project for us is really just something big.

154
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:27.111
Uh,
we,

155
00:11:27.111 --> 00:11:30.790
the young talent and leaders and such was going to explain us a little bit more

156
00:11:30.791 --> 00:11:35.530
about her story.
But,
uh,
this project really means a lot for us.
Uh,
like I said,

157
00:11:35.531 --> 00:11:39.520
the mission is in her head,
but also in our life.
Um,

158
00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:40.810
that's what we're going through.
Everything.

159
00:11:40.811 --> 00:11:44.650
My dream came true and coming to the MBA association did a lot for me,

160
00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:46.540
for me and my family.
And,
uh,

161
00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:50.470
today I can really say that basketball saved my life have made through

162
00:11:50.471 --> 00:11:53.560
everything and I'm really thankful for that.
Thank you.

163
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:58.660
<v 0>Thank you,
Gretchen.
Um,
as you see,
um,
uh,</v>

164
00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:03.370
Gershwin and Kudo here represent well the,
the ecosystem of giving back and,
uh,

165
00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.530
as far as,
uh,
uh,
as a young student,

166
00:12:05.531 --> 00:12:09.190
athletes that were empowered a fru for the endeavors and,
uh,

167
00:12:09.191 --> 00:12:13.900
that also were able to overcome their,
they own problems.

168
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:18.580
And,
uh,
we,
we see a lot of,
uh,
problems all around the world and,
uh,

169
00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:23.050
and we think it's always with,
uh,
the powerful,
the has to come back,

170
00:12:23.051 --> 00:12:28.030
come to the power less and find a solution.
But,
uh,
we,
we know that,
uh,

171
00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:32.050
uh,
in those,
in industry rough neighborhoods,
um,
uh,
there's,

172
00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.370
there's a lot of kids that have a lot of talents and,
uh,
if,

173
00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:40.090
if they're given a chance to bring their talent up in whatever it is,
they,
they,

174
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:43.870
they can change the world because they can grow up with that mission to come

175
00:12:43.871 --> 00:12:48.790
back to the communities and change it.
Um,
as,
as,
as,
uh,
Gershwin measured.

176
00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:53.160
I mentioned.
Um,
right now we're trying to to scale the system.
Uh,

177
00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:58.180
this giving back system and the best way that we found is a tool to put our

178
00:12:58.331 --> 00:12:59.830
efforts into young women,

179
00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:03.340
especially young women right now in west Africa and a,

180
00:13:03.341 --> 00:13:07.000
I'm going to introduce a video right now that's going to tell you the story of

181
00:13:07.001 --> 00:13:10.780
Amsa to job who was right here and a WHO's part of our program now

182
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:13.440
<v 5>growing up in Italy,</v>

183
00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:18.860
I understood the word privilege when spending summertime in my beautiful native

184
00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:23.130
Senegal and seeing a lot of my girls beers,

185
00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:28.550
having no access to education and no skill that who allow them to enjoy a

186
00:13:29.581 --> 00:13:31.470
dignified basic life.

187
00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:37.330
Michael's in Binta is one of the 7 million woman who social faith is doomed to

188
00:13:38.671 --> 00:13:41.610
fail before they life even start.

189
00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:44.790
I had to find a way to break the cycle.

190
00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:53.640
[inaudible] was all I had a scholastic education,

191
00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:58.680
access to global culture and thinking and more importantly,

192
00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:04.520
a loving and caring single mother that gave me more than I ever needed.

193
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.760
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

194
00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:11.760
<v 5>I realize how much some of our dysfunctional local resources had to offer.</v>

195
00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:19.020
I went on collecting and recycling the small wasted piece of African craft that

196
00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:24.640
our hundred thousand woken pillows throw away every day.

197
00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:28.960
And I created a sustainable interior design.

198
00:14:28.961 --> 00:14:31.270
Brand name Wolof

199
00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:50.310
dual solution is accessible by any group who is a willing learner as it takes is

200
00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:56.891
20 cents the cost of a thread and a needle to come and acquire the basics at my

201
00:14:57.951 --> 00:14:59.680
feet of charter workshops.

202
00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:03.920
Open it to young girls that have no access to education.

203
00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:09.340
My vision is to sell Wolof globally and disrupt the interior design industry by

204
00:15:10.671 --> 00:15:12.770
giving a voice to the voiceless.

205
00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:16.520
And yet so elegant and powerful women of Africa.

206
00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:19.270
Soon enough,
Wolof,

207
00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:24.290
we'd be able to tell the board a new set of inspiring deals of the hardworking

208
00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:30.530
was Indian creative and traditional African woman.

209
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:38.500
This community will keep growing as the girl we empowered today will mentor the

210
00:15:39.201 --> 00:15:41.900
next generation of interior designers.

211
00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:47.150
They will be able to enjoy a sustainable living bread,

212
00:15:47.151 --> 00:15:52.151
the cycle of illiteracy and will become role models of their daughters.

213
00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:58.010
Dislike.
My mother has been for me all my life.

214
00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:12.200
<v 6>Hi everyone.
Thank you so much for having us here today.
Um,</v>

215
00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:15.560
as you saw,
I am the proud founder of Wolof,

216
00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:19.850
but also I am the mentor of,
uh,
the Grill Academy,

217
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:22.910
one of the first mentors.
So I've been,

218
00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:29.810
I've been on the program for the past few months and for those past few months,

219
00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:34.840
there have been two words that have stuck with me and have been my mantra.

220
00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:38.660
So those words are embrace yourself.

221
00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:43.790
A lot of people ask me why I choose those two words because they've also been my

222
00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:48.860
Instagram Hashtag for every feature that I've posted.
But those two words,

223
00:16:48.861 --> 00:16:50.450
because for the past few months,

224
00:16:50.451 --> 00:16:54.290
I have been embracing every single fiber of myself.

225
00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:58.580
I've been embracing my fears,
my flaws,
my weaknesses.

226
00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:01.880
But mostly I've been aware of what is surrounding me.

227
00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:06.050
And as a mentor for the next generation of the grower academy,

228
00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:10.760
I want to pass all this feeling to these girls because I want them to be

229
00:17:10.761 --> 00:17:12.950
fearless,
to be powerful.

230
00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:17.660
But mostly I want them to believe in themselves because we live in a society

231
00:17:17.661 --> 00:17:22.460
where everything they tell us every day is,
you can't make it.

232
00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:25.100
And my question is always,
why?

233
00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:29.990
It's because you're a woman and want them to actually believe that they can if

234
00:17:29.991 --> 00:17:31.640
they put their mindset into it.

235
00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:37.070
That's why I created the groove academy and it's not like any other academy

236
00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:41.840
because we use tools,
ours,
virtual reality,
video games,

237
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:45.620
chess,
coding,
programming,
boxing.

238
00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:50.800
Because we want these girls to be challenged every and we want them to believe

239
00:17:51.391 --> 00:17:54.990
that if you put your mindset into something,
you can make it.

240
00:17:55.470 --> 00:18:00.060
We have to break all the obstacles that are in your way in order to do that,

241
00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:01.890
and as you know,

242
00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:06.150
the [inaudible] Academy's going to use the same ecosystem as giving back,

243
00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:09.240
meaning that the girls that we empowered today,

244
00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:12.510
we'll come back as mentor for the next generation,

245
00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:16.290
but we're not like the man's here.

246
00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:21.660
It's not going to take us 10 years to do that.
It took,
you can take us,

247
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:26.550
we want these girls to be able to do that within three months and having done

248
00:18:26.551 --> 00:18:30.690
this program for a week before coming here,
I can assure you that I did.

249
00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:35.280
These girls are able to give back within two weeks,
within a week.

250
00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:39.330
They're able to teach others what they've learned within a week.

251
00:18:39.331 --> 00:18:44.331
They appropriated the program for themselves and for me that is incredible

252
00:18:44.761 --> 00:18:49.761
because I now can see all the work that has been done by giving back in,

253
00:18:50.281 --> 00:18:55.281
by grow now that it's actually is possible because some of them we went to the

254
00:18:55.801 --> 00:19:00.530
giving back day where they dug all of these girls that don't have access to

255
00:19:00.531 --> 00:19:01.171
education,

256
00:19:01.171 --> 00:19:06.171
how to play video games and those girls that same day we're able to help.

257
00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:08.920
There are others school,

258
00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:13.980
the other girls that are there how to play video games and they never been to

259
00:19:13.981 --> 00:19:14.730
school.

260
00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:19.320
They don't know what his football or how to play with cars.

261
00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:24.410
So I can assure you that this program is amazing and I'm really thankful to be

262
00:19:24.781 --> 00:19:29.781
here today and to speak for these girls and also to speak for myself for my

263
00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:34.830
story and also for giving back in the groove academy.
Thank you.

264
00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:37.430
Thank you.
[inaudible] we are,

265
00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.530
we actually have a little video rather grow academy.
All right.

266
00:19:40.531 --> 00:19:42.060
Where are you going to see those girls in action?

267
00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:06.540
<v 2>I wanted to use my passion and my passion is fashion to give people happiness as</v>

268
00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:13.010
I am now a matter of the next generation.
The Royal Academy,
something caught me.

269
00:20:13.011 --> 00:20:16.510
It was the motto of giving by was never forget where you come from.

270
00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:19.660
That's how real is.

271
00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:24.670
So it's been on the transmission and the real investing in the program decided

272
00:20:26.001 --> 00:20:31.001
to focus on women because we know that women are the future one advances.

273
00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:36.620
We all advance when one succeeds or knows how to,
you know,
solve a problem.

274
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:41.090
We help to bring the other girl up along with her.
Nobody gets left behind.

275
00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.130
And the Grill Academy,

276
00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:08.940
uh,
let's see,

277
00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:10.200
I liquid

278
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:23.370
capacity.
So kindof it

279
00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:27.003
approval

280
00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:33.430
<v 8>the girl academy.
Not only do we believe in you,</v>

281
00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:37.750
but we want you to also believe in yourself.
Like it's not,
it's never easy.

282
00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:41.650
It's never going to be an easy journey.
Sometimes you'll fall,

283
00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:45.970
sometimes you'll feel so good about yourself and sometimes it'll knock you right

284
00:21:45.971 --> 00:21:49.810
back down.
But the point of it all is that you get up,

285
00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:51.310
brush off the

286
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:55.780
<v 2>dirt,
and then we get back right on it.
And,
you know,
become champions,</v>

287
00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.910
become who we truly are.

288
00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:37.810
[inaudible]

289
00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:14.713
okay.

290
00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:44.690
Well English.
Okay.
Good morning.
Good morning.

291
00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:49.490
Thanks.
[inaudible].

292
00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.273
Don't

293
00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:01.630
even like days.

294
00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:18.850
<v 0>Okay.
Um,
so this is,
this was,
uh,
the,</v>

295
00:24:18.851 --> 00:24:23.030
the last video here that we're going to show,
but,
uh,
before we,
uh,

296
00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:27.170
we go for the Q and a.
Um,
just,
just,
uh,
this,

297
00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.580
this experience with the,
uh,

298
00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:33.560
with the girl academy has been transforming the whole organization really

299
00:24:33.561 --> 00:24:36.750
because we came to the realization that to,

300
00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:41.870
in order to be able to get a powerful social entrepreneurs,

301
00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:46.850
it's not just about,
uh,
going on to a path,
a set path like,

302
00:24:46.851 --> 00:24:49.520
hey,
here's your mission.
Your vision here is what you gotta do.

303
00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:54.470
But it's also about revealing the best in us wherever he is,
the self confidence,

304
00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:59.210
the ability to transmit the messages to the next generation,
uh,

305
00:24:59.211 --> 00:25:02.510
their ability to listen,
to be,
to have collaborative work.

306
00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:04.520
So that's what those girls have been doing.

307
00:25:04.521 --> 00:25:07.760
And I'm sad to has been a terrific mentor for all those girls.

308
00:25:07.761 --> 00:25:11.600
And all those girls that you see here are going to be the mentor to the next

309
00:25:11.601 --> 00:25:15.320
generation as well.
And that's how we are building this community.

310
00:25:15.321 --> 00:25:18.680
And we think that if every community can be built that way,

311
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:20.930
every social business can be built that way,

312
00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:25.340
then that's the answer to be sustainable and to be able to defeat the problems

313
00:25:25.341 --> 00:25:29.630
of the poverty.
So thank you everybody for coming.
Thank you for having us again.

314
00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:31.003
Thank you.

315
00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:35.990
<v 9>I just wanted to ask a couple questions to wrap up here.</v>

316
00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:39.260
Um,
first you mentioned giving back days.

317
00:25:39.261 --> 00:25:42.110
Do you want to explain to us a little bit more about how they work and what your

318
00:25:42.111 --> 00:25:43.550
plans are for the future for that?

319
00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:49.420
<v 0>So the giving back days are,
um,
Nah,
days of happiness that we give to,
uh,</v>

320
00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:54.220
uh,
kids usually have,
uh,
people from a vulnerable groups.

321
00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:56.370
Um,
and that,
uh,

322
00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:00.310
what we want in those in those in those days is to be able to reproduce what we

323
00:26:00.311 --> 00:26:01.360
do at the Royal Academy.

324
00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:05.890
Meaning really give him confidence into what they're doing and show him the path

325
00:26:05.891 --> 00:26:10.870
of giving back in one day.
And we do that in a fun way,
but also it's a,
it's a,

326
00:26:10.871 --> 00:26:13.990
it's a platform for all of us to be able to go back and give.

327
00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.480
And that's one thing that is very important now.

328
00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:21.250
Our system is that ecosystem that we put together.
The were every,

329
00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:24.940
everybody can come in and be a part of it.
And uh,

330
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.690
and so that's the giving back days and it's been very successful because we've

331
00:26:28.691 --> 00:26:32.350
been able to,
to touch a lot of young people through that program.

332
00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.120
<v 9>Um,
thank you Baba car.
Next,
uh,</v>

333
00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:37.580
for those of us in the audience that would like to get involved,

334
00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:41.330
what are some of the ways that we could help out giving back and grow academy?

335
00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:46.760
<v 0>Well,
um,
come,
come over to synagogue.
Uh,
uh,
you see it's a beautiful countries,</v>

336
00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:49.700
sunny and uh,
and more importantly,
a,

337
00:26:49.701 --> 00:26:54.570
those girls can really benefit from the experiences of everybody.
Uh,

338
00:26:54.571 --> 00:26:58.320
again,
we,
we,
we talk about mentorship.
Uh,
there is no professors,

339
00:26:58.321 --> 00:27:02.700
there is no traditional teacher in our academy and these are college girls.
Um,

340
00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:05.150
but I think they really enjoy,
uh,

341
00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:08.100
having expertise and experience from all over the world.

342
00:27:08.101 --> 00:27:09.630
So that would be the first thing.

343
00:27:09.631 --> 00:27:13.560
The other thing is that we always trying to research a new ways to,

344
00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:15.000
to problem solve.
Um,

345
00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:18.870
you saw that lab that we put together with all those different tools.
Um,

346
00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:22.950
and if you have any ideas,
if you want to be part of that,
please let us know.

347
00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:26.200
And uh,
and the last thing is that those girls have um,

348
00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:30.630
they put together all day at work.
They organized their work into a Google drive,

349
00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:36.330
Google docs and a,
and they share it.
Uh,
so they have self evaluation,

350
00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:40.110
um,
uh,
within themselves.
But also we invite anybody that could,

351
00:27:40.111 --> 00:27:42.530
that would want to be a mentor,
um,

352
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:46.200
and not being able to come all the way there to also be,

353
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:49.850
be able to do it that way so that a girl could share,
for example,

354
00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:54.420
her work with you.
Well,
on behalf of Google,
thank you very much for coming,

355
00:27:54.421 --> 00:27:58.140
Bubba Karger.
Sean,
I'm so too,
and Cujo we really enjoyed hearing from you and,

356
00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:01.320
and appreciate the great work that you're doing for your communities.

357
00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:02.930
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
