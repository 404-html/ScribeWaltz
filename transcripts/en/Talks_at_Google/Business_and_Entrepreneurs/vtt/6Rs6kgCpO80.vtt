1
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.840
Thank you.
I got to ask her like,

2
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.120
am I in Google land?
Like are you guys really

3
00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:15.720
<v 1>glory?
Cause you know,</v>

4
00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:19.590

5
00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:23.430
you hold an incredible amount of influence.
You really do.

6
00:00:23.431 --> 00:00:27.390
We're going to talk about that.
How many of you want to change your

7
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.770
<v 0>career trajectory in some way?
Raise your hand.</v>

8
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.450
How many of you want to change your personal trajectory in some way?

9
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.120
How about your legacy trajectory that you want to leave in some way?

10
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.990
And how many of you wouldn't raise your hands no matter what I said?

11
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.730
Pretty good.
So great to be here.
Thank you.

12
00:00:49.731 --> 00:00:52.280
Danielle and Stephanie Reid Hoffman,

13
00:00:52.281 --> 00:00:55.490
who's actually a on our advisory board for girls in the impacts that she's

14
00:00:55.491 --> 00:00:59.660
awesome.
Yeah,
she's a Googler in New York.
Um,
so if you don't mind,

15
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.210
I'd love to start when you were young,
um,

16
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.650
this idea that you decided to go get a job at the motel made at the age of 14.

17
00:01:06.651 --> 00:01:10.550
What on Earth inspired you to do that and to do that job?

18
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.760
<v 1>You know,
I,
uh,</v>

19
00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.790
my mom found herself single when I was five years old and she was single with no

20
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.980
formal education,
uh,
three little kids,
one,
four and five.

21
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.330
And uh,
she had to work two full time jobs as a waitress to make ends meet.

22
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.680
And I sort of that that had a huge impact on me.

23
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.740
And when I was 12 years old riding home from school one day on my navy blue

24
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.160
Schwinn bike,
I sort of had this epiphany and it was,
you know,
sort of a vision,

25
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.210
a vision that um,
three things became really clear at,

26
00:01:45.211 --> 00:01:48.730
which was I wanted my own financial independence.

27
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.130
I wanted to have a big impact and I had this sense because nobody was there for

28
00:01:54.131 --> 00:01:54.521
my mom,

29
00:01:54.521 --> 00:01:57.010
that it was all up to me and that I was going to have to pull myself up by the

30
00:01:57.011 --> 00:01:57.960
boot trout straps.

31
00:01:57.961 --> 00:02:02.230
So I was really focused on trying to make something of myself and I didn't care

32
00:02:02.231 --> 00:02:04.750
what it took.
I was,
I wanted to put myself through college.

33
00:02:04.751 --> 00:02:08.050
And so that was the job down the road.
And at least I can say,

34
00:02:08.051 --> 00:02:11.570
can make a bed the holiday inn way.
So we still do it.

35
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:13.610
<v 0>That's awesome.
I mean,</v>

36
00:02:13.611 --> 00:02:16.670
I completely resonate with the idea of financial independence.

37
00:02:16.671 --> 00:02:20.970
That was very early driver for me as well.
Um,
and you know,

38
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.160
as I just mentioned,

39
00:02:22.161 --> 00:02:27.080
I've found myself kinda jumping around trying to find that thing that's gonna

40
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.890
generate interest but also have a huge impact and also help my pocketbook.
Yeah.

41
00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.990
Um,
so when you're deciding to make these shifts,

42
00:02:35.991 --> 00:02:40.010
like how do you know when it's the right time?
Yeah,
it's really hard,
right?

43
00:02:40.011 --> 00:02:43.480
I mean,
sometimes you're forced to make a shift.
Um,
and,

44
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.610
and I hear a lot of that from some people,
but you know,
an interesting story,

45
00:02:46.611 --> 00:02:49.990
I used to work in California government for Governor Jerry Brown,

46
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.560
sister Kathleen Brown.
And uh,
she was running for governor and I,

47
00:02:54.561 --> 00:02:58.970
and I was suppressed secretary and I sort of had an Aha moment and I thought,

48
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.070
know I could spend

49
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.070
<v 1>the rest of my career promoting somebody else's ideas or I could develop my own</v>

50
00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:08.740
ideas.
And it was a moment where I sort of,

51
00:03:08.741 --> 00:03:10.690
and I think this is really important for all of you,

52
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:15.250
is to look at the path you're on is the path you're on going to get you to where

53
00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:18.490
you want to go.
And at that point I sort of decided,
you know what,

54
00:03:18.491 --> 00:03:21.640
I think I'll be pigeonholed if I stay in state government too long.

55
00:03:21.641 --> 00:03:25.630
I thought it would.
So I moved into the financial industry.

56
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.710
And then the other thing that I think is really important in deciding like when

57
00:03:29.711 --> 00:03:32.260
do you make that change is looking at trends and data.

58
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.690
And so kind of fast forward a little bit,

59
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.190
I was in business school and working full time at a large bank and I was

60
00:03:39.191 --> 00:03:43.120
noticing a lot of data and trends and those trends at the time where that uh,

61
00:03:43.121 --> 00:03:46.450
women were building wealth but they were not going to places like Yahoo finance

62
00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:47.470
to invest their money.

63
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.920
And I sort of had an Aha and a in short developed this idea for women's

64
00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:56.080
financial network,
which,
which the first a financial site for women.

65
00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.450
My boyfriend at the time though said,
you know Jen,
I mean it's really good idea,

66
00:04:01.451 --> 00:04:04.570
but like Tarrel Schwab could come in and like take you over tomorrow.

67
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.050
And he was sort of right about that.
But I thought,
you know what,

68
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.650
they're not doing it now.
I got my business plan in hand.

69
00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.920
I had started to form a team and I was like,
you know what?

70
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.450
I'm going to go for it.

71
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:20.980
And it completely changed the trajectory of my career.

72
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.010
I was working at a financial firm at the time and the,

73
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.570
my boss invites me over for dinner.
Um,
you know,
whole different thing.

74
00:04:28.571 --> 00:04:32.470
I mean I felt like all of a sudden I had climbed like 10 runs up the career

75
00:04:32.471 --> 00:04:33.304
ladder.

76
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.490
I ended up doing a book becoming Microsoft money spokesperson if completely

77
00:04:38.831 --> 00:04:43.210
changed my career.
So what I would say is look at the path you're on.

78
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.920
Is it getting you where you want to go?

79
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.260
Is it building this kinds of skills that you want?

80
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.330
Getting you the kind of connections that you want,

81
00:04:49.331 --> 00:04:51.760
giving you the credibility that you need to move forward.

82
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.120
And then also think about the data or trends taking place.

83
00:04:55.121 --> 00:04:58.420
I think it's really important to stay at the forefront and then there's a little

84
00:04:58.421 --> 00:04:59.680
gut that comes into play there.

85
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.520
<v 0>Yeah,
yeah.
But all that can be pretty darn stressful,
right?</v>

86
00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.840
I mean it can be stressful.

87
00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.950
They say that what the top stress makers are getting married,

88
00:05:08.951 --> 00:05:11.650
moving and changing her career maybe.

89
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.470
So how do you manage all that?

90
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.620
<v 1>Well,
you know,
it's,
it's really tough,
right?
I mean,</v>

91
00:05:17.621 --> 00:05:22.621
I actually had an experience where I sort of adopted a philosophical approach.

92
00:05:22.841 --> 00:05:27.220
So a long time ago when I worked for another elected official as I was kind of

93
00:05:27.221 --> 00:05:29.680
coming out of Ucla,
um,

94
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.240
I got a job there when it got close to a job as the assistant press secretary

95
00:05:34.241 --> 00:05:37.690
for then Mayor Tom Bradley of La,
very famous mayor.

96
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.920
And they basically told me I had the job and I went back to my day job and I'm

97
00:05:41.921 --> 00:05:45.280
still wrapping up college.
And uh,
they called me up and they say,

98
00:05:45.281 --> 00:05:47.290
do you know what?
Sorry.

99
00:05:47.291 --> 00:05:50.560
But the mayor wants more diversity on the team.

100
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.030
Actually.
Completely got it.
I was a woman,

101
00:05:55.031 --> 00:05:58.340
but he wanted really more diversity and it was kind of okay.

102
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:03.790
And so I sat back and then a couple months later I ended up getting through the

103
00:06:05.811 --> 00:06:10.811
boss at the time connection to ultimately become the press secretary to Kathleen

104
00:06:10.821 --> 00:06:12.620
round,
governor Jerry Brown's sister.

105
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.840
And at the age of 25 that was an amazing opportunity.

106
00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:21.080
And so I really now feeling,
and some of those comes from age,

107
00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:26.081
that things happen at the right time for a reason and it's really easy to get

108
00:06:26.421 --> 00:06:29.870
impatient.
And so I know still to this day,

109
00:06:29.871 --> 00:06:32.180
I will force myself to breathe and say,
you know,

110
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.080
the time of when the right opportunities there,
it's going to happen.

111
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.410
But it's also important to keep yourself out there and open to those

112
00:06:39.411 --> 00:06:44.060
opportunities.
Yeah,
I mean you've done such an amazing job in which is

113
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:49.070
<v 0>really evident in your book where she's interviewed,
you know,
hundreds of highly,</v>

114
00:06:49.071 --> 00:06:53.120
highly influential people all over the world.
Um,

115
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:58.240
how did you build your influence and your personal brand so that you could have

116
00:06:58.341 --> 00:06:59.900
these interviews and really

117
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:05.050
<v 1>gain those insights and connections.
So I think credibility is so important,</v>

118
00:07:05.051 --> 00:07:06.880
especially here in the valley.

119
00:07:06.881 --> 00:07:11.110
And I saw the power of that when I worked in government for Kathleen because you

120
00:07:11.111 --> 00:07:11.201
know,

121
00:07:11.201 --> 00:07:14.220
there was sort of considered the Kennedys or the west coast and the media and,

122
00:07:14.221 --> 00:07:16.330
and,
and so I saw the influence of media.

123
00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:20.230
And then when I was starting to build my first company and I had just a business

124
00:07:20.231 --> 00:07:20.981
plan in hand,

125
00:07:20.981 --> 00:07:25.590
I went to then ultimately ended up meeting with the CEO of CBS MarketWatch

126
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:28.210
financial site in town.
And,
uh,

127
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:32.620
I had this idea and a long story short,
he wasn't willing to invest in it,

128
00:07:32.621 --> 00:07:35.380
but he said,
you know,
why don't you become our women in money columnist?

129
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:38.590
And I scratched my hand.
I thought,
oh my gosh,
another thing to do.

130
00:07:38.591 --> 00:07:40.300
How am I going to do this?
But I thought,
you know,

131
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.830
it's going to give me some credibility is I'm out building this business,
uh,

132
00:07:44.831 --> 00:07:47.290
I'm going to do that.
And um,

133
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:52.300
and so there's so much power in credibility.
But the other piece of it,

134
00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:57.100
there's a couple of other pieces is number one is having a niche focus.

135
00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:02.400
Look at yourself and the expertise that you have that's really unique to you and

136
00:08:02.441 --> 00:08:05.920
build off that.
I mean,
everybody has that and trust me,

137
00:08:05.921 --> 00:08:09.190
I've had to go through exercises with myself to really think about like,

138
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:13.510
what is it that I know?
For me it's the nexus of finance,

139
00:08:13.511 --> 00:08:18.310
technology and women,
I would say,
right?
Because somewhat unique.
So look at that.

140
00:08:18.311 --> 00:08:22.930
And then the other is don't underestimate the power of confidence because a lot

141
00:08:22.931 --> 00:08:26.650
of people,
no matter what level you're at,
you might think,
oh,
I'm not good enough.

142
00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:29.350
I can't,
I can't be talking to see you,
I'm not,
whatever.

143
00:08:29.351 --> 00:08:33.700
But if you don't deliver a message with confidence,

144
00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:35.740
you're never going to go any place.

145
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.280
You all know something extremely well.

146
00:08:39.281 --> 00:08:42.910
You wouldn't be here working if you didn't.
I don't care what area it is,

147
00:08:42.911 --> 00:08:45.520
content marketing,
digital data analytics.

148
00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:48.160
And so when you present something,

149
00:08:48.161 --> 00:08:51.430
the power of presenting it with authority and credibility,

150
00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:54.790
it will make all the difference in your ability to move forward.

151
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.140
The last thing is that I do,
and I've had to learn this.
I mean,

152
00:08:58.141 --> 00:09:01.170
I came from completely,
nothing is drawing,

153
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:05.610
pulling in those threads that build that credibility foundation for you.
So like,

154
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.300
you know,
there've been times when I'm talking to somebody or wanting to form a

155
00:09:09.301 --> 00:09:14.301
partnership or whatever and I built an advisory board with some name people to

156
00:09:14.551 --> 00:09:18.480
give me that credibility.
So people said,
Oh yeah,
that's,
you know,

157
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:23.190
that's interesting to me.
So those are um,
uh,

158
00:09:23.191 --> 00:09:24.990
some ways that you know,
you can do that.

159
00:09:24.991 --> 00:09:29.100
The last thing that's worth mentioning is connecting with people on a personal

160
00:09:29.101 --> 00:09:34.020
level.
It doesn't matter who you're talking to,
CEO,
janitor,
whatever.

161
00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:35.610
Everybody is a person.

162
00:09:35.611 --> 00:09:39.870
And sort of a good example is back to when I was building women's financial

163
00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:44.310
network and wanting to connect with very influential people to endorse it or

164
00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.070
whatever.
When was Debbi fields of Mrs. Fields cookies.

165
00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:52.520
And the reason she kind of pro came back is that she saw what happened with her

166
00:09:53.611 --> 00:09:54.091
mother,

167
00:09:54.091 --> 00:09:58.410
couldn't even balance a checkbook and she was dealing with her own daughter.

168
00:09:58.411 --> 00:10:02.850
So that personal connection,
no matter who you're talking to,

169
00:10:02.851 --> 00:10:06.510
pitching,
building relationships,
wanting to form a partnership,

170
00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:10.470
honestly I think comes down to that personal connection almost more than

171
00:10:10.471 --> 00:10:10.770
anything.

172
00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:13.690
<v 0>Mm.
Yeah,
that's great advice.
I mean,</v>

173
00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:18.870
given that I came from the new space and I know how finicky media can be,

174
00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:24.180
you know,
you,
you say it as if it's so easy to get pension,
Amelia,

175
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:28.110
but how do you know,
how do you do that?
Like,
how did you do what,

176
00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.580
how did you get someone to say,
yes,
Jennifer,

177
00:10:30.581 --> 00:10:35.280
we'll have you on CNN or how did you get on Oprah or Howard

178
00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:39.490
<v 1>and things building upon things so that I also Shuja believe,</v>

179
00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:42.050
believe in the power of boy,

180
00:10:42.051 --> 00:10:45.020
there's so many good examples and we'll talk about one a little bit later,
but,

181
00:10:45.021 --> 00:10:48.830
um,
when something happens is to build upon,
I mean,

182
00:10:48.831 --> 00:10:51.530
a few examples would be,
for example,
uh,

183
00:10:51.531 --> 00:10:55.160
when Martha Stewart was going through her crisis,
uh,

184
00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:59.210
I had a really kind of interesting message.
I said,
you know what,

185
00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:02.870
like despite what she has or has not done,

186
00:11:02.871 --> 00:11:06.020
she has still delivered products,
uh,

187
00:11:06.021 --> 00:11:09.320
of great value that,
that everyday people can use.

188
00:11:09.321 --> 00:11:13.940
I think she might w with scan this crisis and I went on CNN,

189
00:11:13.941 --> 00:11:15.610
the next thing and I was doing live shots.

190
00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:18.620
And the next thing is like Fox and the other media are seeing that here in

191
00:11:18.621 --> 00:11:20.030
silicon valley.
When I was here,

192
00:11:20.031 --> 00:11:24.590
actually what happened is I got profiled in the San Francisco Chronicle and I

193
00:11:24.591 --> 00:11:27.530
had been thinking about a book and the agent said,
you know what,

194
00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.650
now we've got that profile,
we can take it to the publisher.

195
00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:34.970
They like seeing it cause its credibility and oh and you also have a company.

196
00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:39.110
And then that led to a lot of other things and also understanding how to tell a

197
00:11:39.111 --> 00:11:42.230
good story helped or how to communicate.
Um,

198
00:11:42.231 --> 00:11:44.960
in my case it was educating people about finances.

199
00:11:44.961 --> 00:11:49.820
So when I started building this company,
you know,
I sort of said,
gosh,

200
00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.500
I want to help build our brand,

201
00:11:51.501 --> 00:11:54.460
but I don't want to spend gazillions of money like a lot of companies do.

202
00:11:54.461 --> 00:11:57.460
Sometimes I think not so wisely.
I thought,
you know,

203
00:11:57.461 --> 00:12:02.080
I'm going to try to position us as the authority on women and money.
You know,

204
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:04.920
I'm not bad on TV,
I'm not gray,
done a little bit,
but I'm really,

205
00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:06.850
what's it not as good as a lot of other people.

206
00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:11.230
And I tried it and when I went on good enough to be asked back on.

207
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:15.970
And so all of that created this and then,
and then what happened?

208
00:12:15.971 --> 00:12:19.480
Then a Cycore soft then because I was out in the media,

209
00:12:19.481 --> 00:12:22.660
then Microsoft saw me out there and they wanted to do a campaign across the

210
00:12:22.661 --> 00:12:25.900
country educating women about money and they came to me and I worked for them

211
00:12:25.901 --> 00:12:26.680
for three years.

212
00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.260
<v 0>So it was really finding that that niche,</v>

213
00:12:29.261 --> 00:12:34.261
that unique today and then getting the one media outlet to pick you up and then

214
00:12:35.231 --> 00:12:40.231
start generating interest with other outlets once you use your ability to pick

215
00:12:40.661 --> 00:12:44.940
up a trend.
And then that leads to so many new opportunities.
I mean it's,
it's,

216
00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:45.890
it's really smart.

217
00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:49.010
<v 1>And the couple of the things you guys can do,
and I talked about people,</v>

218
00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:52.430
so let's say you have a particular niche and you have something to say because

219
00:12:52.431 --> 00:12:56.120
there's so many interesting trends going on.
You could write a byline,

220
00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:01.240
you could partner with somebody of great authority at another organization and

221
00:13:01.341 --> 00:13:05.270
do a byline.
Then you can take that byline and take it to a media outlet.

222
00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:09.630
Truth be told though,
meet his a lot harder today than it was 10 years ago.
Yeah.

223
00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:12.710
Especially the state of everything right now.
It's so,

224
00:13:12.711 --> 00:13:16.600
it's so different to get your message out and so I wouldn't discount,
yeah.

225
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:20.510
Some of the big influencers on social media channels as well and events.

226
00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:23.880
<v 0>So I think a lot of us,
I don't know if I can speak for everybody,
but um,</v>

227
00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:27.910
at some point have been interested in starting something,

228
00:13:27.911 --> 00:13:31.480
whether that be a nonprofit or a company of our own one day.

229
00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:35.860
But making the shift from a major corporation to starting your own business just

230
00:13:35.861 --> 00:13:40.510
seems so overwhelming.
How did you make this shift?
How did you,

231
00:13:40.511 --> 00:13:44.720
what was the thing that sort of helped you to make that transition?

232
00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:46.390
<v 1>Yeah,
I think,
um,</v>

233
00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:50.380
I think it's really important to have a plan before you make a leap.

234
00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:51.843
Um,

235
00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:56.890
I see people who don't think through the basic thing so clearly like a business

236
00:13:56.891 --> 00:13:57.161
plan,

237
00:13:57.161 --> 00:14:00.790
but also what I mean that I think can make a difference if you're going to make

238
00:14:00.791 --> 00:14:05.530
a change,
let's say,
is to have a team with you.

239
00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:09.190
I mean,
one of the lessons I learned that led to that book is don't go it alone.

240
00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:14.050
I sort of,
for too much of my career actually,
when it alone and I learned,

241
00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:17.830
and that's again why I did the book I learned and looking at really wealthy

242
00:14:17.831 --> 00:14:19.630
people were financially successful people,

243
00:14:19.631 --> 00:14:22.840
whether it's Mark Zuckerberg or Bill Gates or Oprah,

244
00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:27.880
you think from the media that they did it all by themselves,

245
00:14:27.881 --> 00:14:32.170
but they really didn't.
They had a core partner in there with them.

246
00:14:32.171 --> 00:14:36.550
And then they leverage their networks to extend externally.
And by the way,

247
00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:41.200
those folks do leverage their networks more than other people and women tend to

248
00:14:41.201 --> 00:14:44.920
not leverage their networks and relationships as much as as men believe it or

249
00:14:44.921 --> 00:14:48.370
not.
Um,
so when making the leap,
I think,
you know,

250
00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:52.370
one way to think about it is you want to build a moat around so that your as in

251
00:14:52.371 --> 00:14:57.371
a steady a foundation as possible and ways that you can do that is having a team

252
00:14:58.190 --> 00:14:59.600
having a deal in hand.

253
00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:03.290
I could give it an example too of when I was at Bank of uh,

254
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:08.320
bank one actually I knew I wanted to start another venture and I had an idea for

255
00:15:08.481 --> 00:15:11.570
some kind of versions of,
of quicken software,

256
00:15:11.571 --> 00:15:13.730
but a little more simplified for consumers.

257
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:18.230
And I had started building this budget kit and before I left I went to the

258
00:15:18.231 --> 00:15:20.620
credit card division.
I said,
you know what,
I'm,

259
00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:24.410
I'm going to try to get a deal on hand to like market,
distribute.

260
00:15:24.411 --> 00:15:25.880
My products are there and I did.

261
00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:29.720
So I would leave with things in place.

262
00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:32.570
I would never like if you need funding for your venture,

263
00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:34.880
I would never leave without funding in place.

264
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:37.820
I would try to have a dealer to enhance,

265
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:42.350
I would have a core team and I would make sure that your team doesn't look and

266
00:15:42.351 --> 00:15:46.880
reflect just like you because you want somebody who can go into those other

267
00:15:46.881 --> 00:15:49.610
areas or bring those other skills that you don't have.
Right.

268
00:15:49.611 --> 00:15:53.120
That's the power of having a team.
Yeah.
So those are a few things.

269
00:15:53.121 --> 00:15:56.360
And then always a plan B.
What if it doesn't work out?

270
00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:01.230
Or what if I decide to,
you know,
stay here and I'm going to go to,
you know,

271
00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:05.960
China and take on a role and the what if a lot of people don't think and plan

272
00:16:05.961 --> 00:16:10.880
through the wedding.
I would say how he,
like if you have spouses or friends,

273
00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:14.240
dear friends,
talk that through.
So you were really thinking through,
okay,

274
00:16:14.241 --> 00:16:18.020
if something falls apart,
if it's dual,
a leg of the stool falls,

275
00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:19.730
what's my game plan?

276
00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:21.041
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

277
00:16:21.041 --> 00:16:24.610
I mean one of the keys that you mentioned in your book is make them want it.

278
00:16:24.611 --> 00:16:28.780
And I think here at Google we have 20% projects and we're trying constantly to

279
00:16:28.781 --> 00:16:33.190
get everybody interested in our new product idea.
Um,

280
00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:36.040
and there's of course with physical products,

281
00:16:36.041 --> 00:16:38.290
you can get those out in the market and you can test them,

282
00:16:38.291 --> 00:16:39.790
which you talk a lot about in your book.

283
00:16:39.791 --> 00:16:43.300
But one thing that I've struggled with is what if it's a service?

284
00:16:43.301 --> 00:16:45.220
What if it's something like consulting?

285
00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:50.250
Then how do you test what you can offer if it's you that you're off?

286
00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:52.740
<v 1>Yeah.
So that,
that's a good one.
Actually.</v>

287
00:16:52.741 --> 00:16:56.070
I've had some friends from some big companies right here come to me on that very

288
00:16:56.071 --> 00:17:00.330
issue,
but I'm going to use,
Mario is a good example.
So Mario headed up,

289
00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:04.530
um,
quicken money way back in the day.
Okay.

290
00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:08.370
And he did exactly that.
And I think he did it the right way.

291
00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:12.360
She ultimately,
what his business is,

292
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:16.650
is outsourced web development.
But in South America,

293
00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:20.190
when you were thinking about making a change,
and particularly in consulting,

294
00:17:20.191 --> 00:17:22.020
because there,
there's so many people out there,

295
00:17:22.021 --> 00:17:25.440
there are people leaving Mckinsey to start up consulting business and
technology.

296
00:17:25.441 --> 00:17:28.830
Right?
That's who you're going up against.
I would think a few things is,

297
00:17:28.831 --> 00:17:33.390
one is is white,
you are delivering really differentiating.

298
00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:36.960
Is it powerful?
I think Mario had that because you know what,

299
00:17:36.961 --> 00:17:40.750
he had lower cost,
English speaking,

300
00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:44.730
same time zone aren't many people were going to a lot of other places,
right?

301
00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:48.870
So definitely a compelling from hand on top of it.
He knows software.

302
00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:53.850
He was doing a Britain to it.
Okay.
So,
um,
have something,

303
00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:57.390
it's gotta be compelling if you want to stay in business.
Secondly,

304
00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:00.240
I would think about bringing really powerful,
uh,

305
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:04.920
people to your team when you have the strength of the Google name behind you.

306
00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:10.140
It's not that as nearly as difficult as a lot of other people.
So I would,

307
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:14.010
I believe in the power of brand association.
Like what are some of,
you know,

308
00:18:14.011 --> 00:18:16.290
you want to bring oof to this team,
like caliber.

309
00:18:16.291 --> 00:18:20.460
So then when you go into your pitching business,
I go,
God,
this how this tune,

310
00:18:20.461 --> 00:18:23.820
they've been a Google and they'd been at Mckinsey whatever.
And Oh gosh,

311
00:18:23.821 --> 00:18:27.510
they know data analytics and they built these models and okay,
so that's that.

312
00:18:27.511 --> 00:18:32.460
And then I would test the waters with potential clients and I would actually try

313
00:18:32.461 --> 00:18:35.440
to have a client or two like ready to go.
That's what,
and then you know,

314
00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:40.440
the last is again,
have a plan B.
So,
um,
in your plan,

315
00:18:40.441 --> 00:18:44.010
like you set some clear goals by the first six months,

316
00:18:44.011 --> 00:18:47.460
we need to achieve x and y for this to like make sense for us.

317
00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:50.100
And um,
you know,

318
00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:53.600
I've seen sort of the power of people setting real markers.

319
00:18:53.601 --> 00:18:55.920
Sometimes we sit like small goals,
but you know,

320
00:18:55.921 --> 00:18:59.590
it's recently with a team of people and uh,
with a,

321
00:18:59.591 --> 00:19:04.390
a big global company and you know,
revenue kind of down.
And uh,

322
00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:08.250
this particular team on the,
on a Saturday I had met and,
and they're thinking,

323
00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.890
yeah,
you know,
so what should our goal be for this year?

324
00:19:10.891 --> 00:19:14.160
Or it could be 40 million.
They said,
you know what,
that's like,
stretch it.

325
00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:17.940
Let's make 60.
I'm,
I'm picking a number,
but these are the range of numbers.

326
00:19:17.941 --> 00:19:22.680
65 million is our goal.
We're going to go for 65.
They went for 65.

327
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:25.860
They exceeded it the following year.

328
00:19:25.861 --> 00:19:29.040
They in the hundred million plus in the following year,
their 200 million.

329
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:33.240
So if they hadn't set those kinds of markers the following years,

330
00:19:33.241 --> 00:19:36.750
they would not have achieved what they achieved.
Right.
They wouldn't up.

331
00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:40.800
So it's the power of thinking big.
I really loved the power of thinking big,

332
00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:46.170
even here at Google and you know,
in one of my roles,
um,
I remember thinking like,

333
00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:49.260
I'm going to focus and you've,
you know,
you've,
you've moved all her,

334
00:19:49.261 --> 00:19:52.260
the advice of focusing,
but I was,
it's actually,

335
00:19:52.261 --> 00:19:54.420
it was right before I started women's financial network.

336
00:19:54.421 --> 00:19:59.340
I was working at another financial firm after Bank of America.
Really Great.

337
00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:03.120
Loved it.
And uh,
but I had this idea,
but I also thought when I went to that for,

338
00:20:03.121 --> 00:20:04.890
I was like,
you know what I,
I'm going to achieve,

339
00:20:04.891 --> 00:20:08.760
I'm going to focus on two or three big rocks that are gonna make a difference.

340
00:20:08.761 --> 00:20:12.600
It's really easy to get caught up in the minutia all day.
It's really easy.

341
00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:16.830
But if you move one or two big rocks,
like it gets noticed.

342
00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:20.580
And that goes back to building your personal brand and increasing your work.

343
00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:24.570
Like,
and I know you guys have a chance for projects here in innovation,

344
00:20:24.571 --> 00:20:28.830
like if you led something like your,

345
00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:30.700
uh,
your vet.

346
00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:33.360
<v 0>Yeah.
We have a thing here called Okr is,</v>

347
00:20:33.361 --> 00:20:36.780
and I feel like they can always end up being 50 lines long.

348
00:20:36.781 --> 00:20:40.500
So consolidating that to just what are the top three things that you really want

349
00:20:40.501 --> 00:20:45.030
to focus on is something that I feel like we all could work on and then stay

350
00:20:45.031 --> 00:20:48.280
focused.
Yeah.
And I ended up doing,
getting a deal.
Long story short

351
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.760
<v 1>is this company has an index,
kind of like the s and p 500 index,</v>

352
00:20:51.761 --> 00:20:55.090
but it really measures the whole market.
Nobody knew about.
Long story short,

353
00:20:55.091 --> 00:20:59.650
it ended up doing a deal with CNBC to use it on TV.
I'm not,

354
00:20:59.651 --> 00:21:03.550
and I never said anything to anybody,
you know,
uh,

355
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:06.910
keep it quiet until you know,
things are buttoned up.

356
00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:11.800
And that was a really big wind.
The CEO even years later would,
you know,

357
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:16.540
remember that.
So focusing on the big kills when you have the strength of Google,

358
00:21:16.541 --> 00:21:17.374
like you all do.

359
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:22.230
<v 0>Yeah.
There is a piece of advice that you gave in your book,
um,
with,
you know,</v>

360
00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:25.710
my,
Angela was one of the contributors and you know,

361
00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:29.650
you had said this is something that really resonated with you and gave you sort

362
00:21:29.651 --> 00:21:34.180
of the,
the ability to go out there and meet anyone.
What was,

363
00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:38.140
what was that advice that you just,
that really stuck with you?
Wait,
her advice.

364
00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:39.640
Maya Angelo.
Yeah.

365
00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:43.470
<v 1>You know,
she said,
um,
that,
um,</v>

366
00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:48.360
the people should not look at themselves no less than the CE.
Oh.

367
00:21:48.361 --> 00:21:53.100
And no greater than the babysitter home.
She pays,
but truly an equal person.

368
00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:56.040
And I think maybe more importantly,
she said that,
you know,

369
00:21:56.041 --> 00:21:59.670
there's a way that you walk into a room,
it's not that they're,

370
00:21:59.671 --> 00:22:01.740
you're so braggadocious she said,

371
00:22:01.741 --> 00:22:06.600
but there's a way that you carry yourself with some Felicity,
some warmth,

372
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:11.760
warmth,
and people feel like I can be okay with this person.

373
00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.130
And so the example would be,

374
00:22:14.131 --> 00:22:17.150
and I don't know if some of you have had had it with leaders and,

375
00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:22.080
and I've had to learn it but,
but it makes you feel kind of powerful is you know,

376
00:22:22.081 --> 00:22:27.081
working with CEOs and when you really know what you're talking about and you say

377
00:22:27.631 --> 00:22:31.830
it with authority because they are looking for good advice themselves by the
way,

378
00:22:31.831 --> 00:22:32.730
they can't do it all.

379
00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:37.620
They will listen and they will then come to rely on you and they'll come back.

380
00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.770
And so it's like taking a breath,

381
00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:46.470
getting in your power.
And I've used the power of visualization a lot in my life.

382
00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:48.990
A lot.
We could talk about that.
But

383
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:50.490
<v 0>yeah,
I mean I,</v>

384
00:22:50.491 --> 00:22:54.840
I'd actually love to go there for a moment because I think a lot of people,

385
00:22:54.841 --> 00:22:56.100
and you had mentioned this in your book,

386
00:22:56.101 --> 00:22:59.280
have this mantra that of the sort of say to themselves or this thing that just

387
00:22:59.281 --> 00:23:03.570
changes their entire presence in a meeting or while they're talking to a

388
00:23:03.571 --> 00:23:07.440
business leader or you have that pitch that you're trying to make.
Like,

389
00:23:07.441 --> 00:23:09.570
what is your process and how,

390
00:23:09.571 --> 00:23:14.571
what tips can you give to people to develop what they can use in those moments?

391
00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:17.570
<v 1>So I'm going to go to,
I'll give you like a really good example.</v>

392
00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.630
So after I sold my company here,
um,

393
00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.790
I was thinking about what I wanted to do next.

394
00:23:22.791 --> 00:23:25.520
I figured I'd start something again,
wasn't quite sure.
I thought,
you know what,

395
00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:29.010
maybe I'll work at a large company.
I ended up,
uh,

396
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:32.780
pitching Jamie diamond,
who was then the CEO.

397
00:23:32.781 --> 00:23:36.530
He's the CEO of JP Morgan Chase now pitching him,
uh,

398
00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:37.880
exploring working with him.

399
00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:41.480
He was the CEO of bank one at the time and I ended up getting a meeting with him

400
00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:44.900
and I'm sitting there like,
and now I was prepared.
We'll get into the,

401
00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:49.700
in the second.
And,
uh,
I was just thinking,
am I going to say what I'm going there?

402
00:23:49.701 --> 00:23:53.600
Right.
But in all honesty,
my suggestions are,

403
00:23:53.601 --> 00:23:57.410
number one is to always do your homework and know something about the person.

404
00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:02.540
I think,
um,
there's so much power and making a personal connection with somebody.

405
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:06.680
And you can do that by,
um,
there's a lot you can find online.

406
00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:10.370
You can pick up something in an office and it can tell you a lot and you can

407
00:24:10.371 --> 00:24:15.260
start from a conversation from there.
Um,
I like to,
you know,
when I'm,

408
00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:20.660
somebody recently was looking for advice,
she's looking for a promotion in her,

409
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:25.220
uh,
in her company actually.
And she,
she needs to sell herself more.

410
00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:26.900
And I said,
you know,

411
00:24:26.901 --> 00:24:31.901
what I would do is a one pager that very clearly and someone visually,

412
00:24:33.201 --> 00:24:34.190
not a bunch of texts,

413
00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:39.190
crystallizes your brand and the impact you've had here.
And she did this,

414
00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:42.980
did that,
and then go have conversations with all the key stakeholders.

415
00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:46.400
And she's doing that right now.
So back to my meeting,

416
00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:51.580
I ended up having a one pager on some specific ideas to build the business that

417
00:24:51.681 --> 00:24:55.330
of course,
leverage what I knew.
So that's the other,
um,

418
00:24:55.610 --> 00:24:58.260
the other thing and then the last is,
um,

419
00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:02.360
to try to offer something of value to somebody when you're meeting with them.

420
00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:06.260
And you know,
one is sort of depends on the situation,

421
00:25:06.261 --> 00:25:11.261
but in a lot of cases it can be as simple as looking on linkedin at the

422
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:15.500
connection points that you have and having a conversation where at some point

423
00:25:15.501 --> 00:25:18.420
you're saying,
gosh,
do you know so and so at such and such company?

424
00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:21.980
And they'll say,
no.
He said,
you know,
what would you like me to introduce you?

425
00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:26.720
People like to do that.
Uh,
they,
they appreciate that.
Um,

426
00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:29.480
and then lastly is,
you know,

427
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:33.470
you've picked up some personal things or things in that meeting with somebody,

428
00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:35.420
anything from their,
uh,

429
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:38.690
their dislikes to personal items to things they share.

430
00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:43.960
Remember that or Tuck it away as I do and include something personal and a

431
00:25:44.421 --> 00:25:47.570
followup note.
I think it makes a big difference.

432
00:25:47.571 --> 00:25:50.810
Like I really liked it when you said that it really stood out or you know,

433
00:25:50.811 --> 00:25:53.720
I think one of the things that could help you move the needle on such and such

434
00:25:53.721 --> 00:25:55.270
that you talked about was that,
uh,

435
00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:59.450
that it makes a difference in your ability to connect with that person and then

436
00:25:59.451 --> 00:26:01.220
to come back to them later.
If you need to,

437
00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:05.420
<v 0>to get to your point about how many people want to leave a legacy to Jennifer's</v>

438
00:26:05.421 --> 00:26:05.781
company,

439
00:26:05.781 --> 00:26:10.280
has working with a bunch of girls trying to help develop them into future female

440
00:26:10.281 --> 00:26:11.550
leaders.
Um,

441
00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:15.890
so what are some of the things that you think are critical to developing in our

442
00:26:15.891 --> 00:26:20.360
youth to really propel women to the top?

443
00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:21.770
Well,
you know,
look at it.

444
00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:25.360
<v 1>You can't open the newspaper without reading about,
you know,
future of work,</v>

445
00:26:25.361 --> 00:26:29.680
getting everybody ready for AI and cryptocurrency and all this stuff.

446
00:26:29.681 --> 00:26:33.550
Diversity,
talent pipeline.
And it's strange that,
you know,

447
00:26:33.551 --> 00:26:38.170
here we are today and only 6% of CEOs are women.
So we want to change that.

448
00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:42.640
And oddly,
while there's a lot of stuff in the stem and coding space,

449
00:26:42.641 --> 00:26:45.330
when you at entrepreneurship or business,

450
00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:50.570
there isn't anything that equips teen girls in this case to actually build those

451
00:26:50.851 --> 00:26:55.450
skills.
And so over 12 weeks they go through a mini Mba.
They do it afterschool,

452
00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:56.640
we offer it year round,

453
00:26:56.910 --> 00:27:00.720
and they go from ideation to an actual business plan and they're launching

454
00:27:00.721 --> 00:27:05.280
ventures.
We just made,
one of them made international headlines,
uh,
the other,

455
00:27:05.281 --> 00:27:07.470
a couple of weeks ago.
Um,

456
00:27:07.471 --> 00:27:12.471
so we're moving the needle in their confidence in giving them a leg up

457
00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:14.250
scholarships,

458
00:27:14.251 --> 00:27:18.540
but at the same time allowing people like you to really,

459
00:27:18.541 --> 00:27:23.541
my hope is that all of you will join us in creating the next generation of real

460
00:27:24.601 --> 00:27:25.950
leaders,
um,

461
00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:29.880
and playing a role in that with us because you can do it on a personal level.

462
00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:32.610
I mean,
there's so many different ways to,
to be involved,

463
00:27:32.611 --> 00:27:36.350
but it's been incredibly exciting what these girls are doing.
Yeah.
Yeah.

464
00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:40.010
It's really awesome.
Companies like Google to who are looking to build,
you know,

465
00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:44.310
a talent pipeline,
um,
this is really important.

466
00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:47.430
And to take what they're learning in stem,
you know,

467
00:27:47.431 --> 00:27:51.660
they can't take what they're learning in stem or coding if they don't have the

468
00:27:51.661 --> 00:27:55.110
business or entrepreneurship skills to create companies and jobs.

469
00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:57.930
[inaudible] well,
thank you.
Um,

470
00:27:58.170 --> 00:28:02.540
I'd now like to turn to the audience if anybody has any questions for Jennifer.

471
00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:05.470
<v 2>Perfect.
So from Emily and tech corners,
uh,</v>

472
00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:09.140
sometimes the power of confidence of delivery outweighs the power of expertise

473
00:28:09.141 --> 00:28:13.030
or skill.
Have you run into that before?
If so,
how do you manage?

474
00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:18.220
<v 1>So I have been in those roles.
So two things that I do.</v>

475
00:28:18.221 --> 00:28:21.880
One is there have been moments where I've taken somebody advice and I just go

476
00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:25.720
get in your power and I stand up tall.

477
00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:31.090
One time when I was hosting some shows,
the producer of the guy said,
you know,
uh,

478
00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:34.650
some advice that he had gotten was to,
um,
love your audience.

479
00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:37.740
And I think there's real power and putting a smile on your face.

480
00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:38.940
It just puts you in the mood.

481
00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:44.340
I think dressing the role actually can give you a lot of confidence,
um,

482
00:28:44.341 --> 00:28:47.940
much more so than you might give credit.
I mean,
it has for me.

483
00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.730
And the last thing is the power of visualization.

484
00:28:50.731 --> 00:28:55.380
So I want to share kind of a fun story is I uh,
uh,

485
00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:55.751
you know,

486
00:28:55.751 --> 00:28:59.190
had a little bit of TV background and when I was really young it was sort of a

487
00:28:59.191 --> 00:29:01.630
kind of what I thought was a dream job.
At long story short,

488
00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:06.880
I ended up getting called by CBS TV and La to come in for an audition,

489
00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:08.113
um,

490
00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:13.160
tomorrow to be there live money expert on TV tomorrow.

491
00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:17.850
Now it's like,
oh my God,
I haven't done this in a year.
And like,

492
00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:21.630
and I'm not really that good and oh my gosh,
but you know,
it'd be cool.

493
00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:25.330
So I get on the phone,
I said,
uh,
can we do this Thursday?

494
00:29:25.331 --> 00:29:29.100
And like I need to buy time.
I was like,
oh my gosh.
And then I just said,

495
00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:31.350
you know what,
because this was kind of like my dream.
I said,

496
00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:34.860
you are going to get this,
you are going to get this.

497
00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:37.110
And I just focused and I was like,

498
00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:42.200
I am pulling out the stops to get this and I'm just going to focus and I'm going

499
00:29:42.731 --> 00:29:43.120
to live her.

500
00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:48.120
And I visualize myself and [inaudible] actually that little experience I shared

501
00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:49.810
when I was 12 years old,

502
00:29:49.811 --> 00:29:53.770
the epiphany really was a visualization about impacting people on a large scale.

503
00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:57.130
I ended up going into this station,

504
00:29:57.690 --> 00:30:01.990
I'm next to the TV anchor I grew up with.
You know,
how weird is that?
Right?

505
00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:06.460
And it's after the morning show and they're like,
okay,
let's do a dry run Jana.

506
00:30:06.461 --> 00:30:07.880
And you know,
I'll see if chicken [inaudible] and,

507
00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:10.960
and so do we do a dry run as okay and okay,
we're,
we're,

508
00:30:10.961 --> 00:30:15.400
we're tape is rolling real life and we do the shtick.

509
00:30:15.401 --> 00:30:17.680
I'm talking about money and you know,

510
00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:20.320
it was out of the park and you sort of know that.

511
00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:24.400
So I really think you have to visualize yourself and I,

512
00:30:24.401 --> 00:30:26.230
I've seen this countless times.

513
00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:31.560
Visualize yourself delivering it or speaking with the picture yourself doing

514
00:30:31.691 --> 00:30:34.600
that.
And then,
um,
and then

515
00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:38.000
<v 0>right.
Go in and do it.
I mean this,</v>

516
00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:41.200
it's sort of similar to another theme in the book that really resonated.

517
00:30:41.201 --> 00:30:43.550
So I'm going to jump in with one more question.
Um,

518
00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:46.370
but you talk about redefining your comfort zone.
Um,

519
00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:49.390
and what I found so interesting is,
you know,
everybody says,
take a leap,

520
00:30:49.391 --> 00:30:51.100
take the leap,
just go do this thing.

521
00:30:51.101 --> 00:30:55.610
But it's not really taking that big of a leap.
Right?
You're still what you,

522
00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:58.810
I'd love to hear sort of what your spiel on it because I thought it was,

523
00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:01.750
<v 1>yeah.
And I,
you know,
so first off,</v>

524
00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:06.900
45% of millionaires experienced fear and two thirds of them though yet said that

525
00:31:08.651 --> 00:31:11.670
they had to move outside their comfort zones in order to,
uh,

526
00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:14.650
build their financial success.
Right?
It just makes sense.
You can't,

527
00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:17.200
you can't stay where you are and get to where you want to go.

528
00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:22.330
You cannot stay where you are and get to want to go where you can't to um,

529
00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:26.260
our friends have the expertise and not deliver it with confidence.

530
00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:29.620
You're holding yourself back.
Why?
There's nothing to be afraid.

531
00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:31.630
Like we hold ourselves back.

532
00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:36.580
And so one way when you're making a change is to realize you're never going to

533
00:31:36.581 --> 00:31:38.830
something completely unfamiliar.

534
00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:43.100
You're almost always leveraging your skillset.
Uh,

535
00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:45.520
it could be a network that's around you.

536
00:31:45.521 --> 00:31:48.460
It could be some people that are working with you that you work with before

537
00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:52.360
there's some familiarity to it.
Um,

538
00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:55.360
and then the last thing is in the book there's a story about Tricia rain where

539
00:31:55.361 --> 00:31:58.420
she was at a school teacher actually made like $100,000,

540
00:31:58.421 --> 00:32:02.230
but she had this cosmetics business on the side and she wanted to make the leap

541
00:32:02.231 --> 00:32:03.820
and she was kind of nervous about it.

542
00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:08.590
And she had a couple kids and she had this Aha moment and she said she was

543
00:32:08.591 --> 00:32:13.210
afraid of losing her paycheck.
Right?
Make sense,
right?
And she said,

544
00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:16.960
you know,
but I'm actually not really guaranteed a paycheck.

545
00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:20.410
I have to show up every day and I have to do it.

546
00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:22.870
And there's lots of ways.

547
00:32:22.871 --> 00:32:26.350
I just had a conversation this weekend with a good friend who has sold two

548
00:32:26.351 --> 00:32:29.200
companies,
a women,
she has a young child,

549
00:32:29.201 --> 00:32:32.470
so she's decided she intentionally wants to keep things ramped down.
But her,

550
00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:35.680
her innovative mind has two other business ideas.

551
00:32:35.681 --> 00:32:40.160
So what she's gonna do is she's going to prep them to take to other companies

552
00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:45.260
for them to run with and she might get a licensing piece of it or help them get

553
00:32:45.261 --> 00:32:49.940
it off the ground or something.
Good idea,
way of staying in what she's doing.
Um,

554
00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:52.940
but still being able to maybe see your ideas come to life,

555
00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.920
which you can do to some extent.
It Google.

556
00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:55.650
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

557
00:32:55.650 --> 00:32:59.010
I mean getting creative about the things you're not great at and using what you

558
00:32:59.011 --> 00:33:00.990
are great at it that I,

559
00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:05.820
when looking back at some of the changes I've made successfully,
it were all,

560
00:33:05.821 --> 00:33:09.990
it was all things that weren't huge leaps that I was doing something that I had

561
00:33:09.991 --> 00:33:13.260
already been doing before.
Um,
and the thing is I didn't go so well.

562
00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:16.890
I tried to make too far of a leap and that's kind of where things go wrong.

563
00:33:16.891 --> 00:33:20.910
So there was the first time I'd ever heard it crystallized in that way.
Um,

564
00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:23.250
any other questions in the audience?

565
00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:29.190
<v 3>So first and foremost,
thank you so much for joining us today.</v>

566
00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:31.620
My question is around comfort zones.

567
00:33:31.621 --> 00:33:34.950
As we talked about when we speak on wealth generation,

568
00:33:34.951 --> 00:33:38.670
people look at that and they look at millionaires and billionaires and think,

569
00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:43.090
wow,
that must've taken a long time or they had a very innovative idea and how do

570
00:33:43.091 --> 00:33:44.220
they get in that space?

571
00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:49.200
What would you say to people who are looking to build wealth or become more

572
00:33:49.201 --> 00:33:53.220
financially sound but see it's so far off in the distance that they're kind of

573
00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:57.510
stuck in place if you will like their caution to move and they think,
oh,

574
00:33:57.511 --> 00:34:01.080
it's such a long journey and I have to do so much to get there.

575
00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:05.420
<v 1>Yeah,
so it's a great question.
Um,
I think people,</v>

576
00:34:05.421 --> 00:34:09.800
I've seen people can get there faster than you think.
So two examples.

577
00:34:09.890 --> 00:34:14.870
Big story over this past weekend about people who had become millionaires in

578
00:34:14.871 --> 00:34:19.440
their thirties and they made a conscious decision because they wanted to live a

579
00:34:19.441 --> 00:34:24.290
different life.
So I basically didn't want to be beholden.
And um,
they,

580
00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:28.070
there's,
there's so many ways that you can live below your means.
I did it.
I mean,

581
00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:33.100
I was always about living below your means because every time you're spending

582
00:34:33.771 --> 00:34:34.630
money it's,

583
00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:37.880
it's going to somebody else and not yourself in the power of compounding that

584
00:34:37.881 --> 00:34:39.740
over the years.
Um,

585
00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:44.800
there's definitely things like completely taking advantage of your 401k whenever

586
00:34:44.871 --> 00:34:47.750
you come across any kind of windfall or extra money.

587
00:34:47.751 --> 00:34:51.420
Like tacking it aside all the time.
Um,

588
00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:55.580
I got lucky when I sold my company.
Well,
not lucky.
I paid attention is,

589
00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:56.570
you know,

590
00:34:56.570 --> 00:35:00.110
made some money and really thought about how it was going to grow it and I put

591
00:35:00.111 --> 00:35:04.250
it in real estate and tripled it and five year literally tripled it in five

592
00:35:04.251 --> 00:35:05.660
years.
Um,

593
00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:10.550
the other really interesting story is that my stepfather found himself

594
00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:14.540
completely out of money at like about 60.

595
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:18.200
He had never saved generation,
hadn't learned.

596
00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:23.650
He started his own business and it was about to get a contract with the city of

597
00:35:23.871 --> 00:35:26.390
La.
And Long Story Short,
uh,

598
00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:31.310
didn't get that contract probably because of some other political stuff.
And uh,

599
00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:32.463
do you know what to do?

600
00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:37.990
And I actually ended up moving in with my parents and,

601
00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:40.920
and I was actually in business school at the time and I sort of feel like,

602
00:35:40.921 --> 00:35:45.160
you know,
there's a,
there was a reason I was living down in that area and,
um,

603
00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:47.400
he reinvented himself,

604
00:35:47.401 --> 00:35:51.570
which is something that everybody has to be continuously at the forefront.

605
00:35:51.571 --> 00:35:56.280
He amazingly learn like cad skills,
all the software,

606
00:35:56.490 --> 00:35:59.550
Internet.
I mean,
here's a guy who was 60 and this is like 10 years ago.

607
00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:03.510
I mean it was really impressive.
And then when he had nothing,

608
00:36:03.511 --> 00:36:05.310
so then he ended up getting high.

609
00:36:05.311 --> 00:36:08.880
He's an engineer by background that since he's an engineer for like,
um,

610
00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:14.150
public facilities and stuff and he ended up getting hired by a solid

611
00:36:14.851 --> 00:36:18.780
construction company that's been around many years and he ended up putting aside

612
00:36:18.781 --> 00:36:23.250
like a half million dollars and not that long a time.
And they still had,

613
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:27.840
you know,
a fairly normal lifestyle.
They had to make a big shift and a change.

614
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:31.920
Um,
but,
but you know,
it's okay.
Like we,

615
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:35.490
the world makes us feel like we have to be living large.

616
00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:38.940
I could care less about having a bigger,
and I don't have a big house by the way,

617
00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:42.420
actually don't want a bigger house but,
but um,

618
00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:47.570
there is some confidence and freedom that really comes from putting it aside and

619
00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:52.740
feeling in control.
And um,
if you're,

620
00:36:52.741 --> 00:36:55.530
if you're a married like having conversations about,

621
00:36:55.531 --> 00:37:00.210
and I did this very regularly.
In fact,
every year I set my own plan.
I,
I've,

622
00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:04.140
I've done this for probably 20 years and I used to do with back day wrote it up

623
00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:07.320
like buddy system.
But every year at the beginning of the year,

624
00:37:07.321 --> 00:37:09.900
I always think about my goals for the year and I,

625
00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:14.430
and I lay him out from a financial perspective,
career and personal,

626
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.480
including,
you know,
building friends or networks.

627
00:37:18.481 --> 00:37:20.820
Cause I haven't been doing that and I know it's important.

628
00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:23.100
I want to share the Alex story cause it's a really great one.

629
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:27.510
So this past weekend,
this friend of mine is at my house and uh,
I said,

630
00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:31.440
Gosh Jyzelle she just,
kids are with their kids.
Gosh,
just so you know,

631
00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:34.560
my husband and I were kind of talking like,
it's very interesting,
you know,

632
00:37:34.561 --> 00:37:36.200
we have dinner parties with people over,

633
00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:39.480
but people don't reciprocate a whole lot.
And she says,
you know,

634
00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:44.070
genuinely share something.
When I was married to Alex and Alex is 49 right now,

635
00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:47.340
nice looking guy.
She works for a hedge fund.

636
00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:52.470
We lived in a 7,000 square foot house.
He made great money and I said,

637
00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:57.090
Alex,
why don't we have your team over?
Why don't we have the analysts over?

638
00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:59.250
We have this house,
like what are we paying for it?

639
00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:02.790
And he just wasn't comfortable with it.
He was like an introvert.

640
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:04.770
He lost his job.

641
00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:10.400
It is three years later and he now has verbally recognized the shortfall of just

642
00:38:14.611 --> 00:38:18.900
failing to reach out.
And I want to go to something about networking too,

643
00:38:18.901 --> 00:38:23.160
which is rather than feeling,
oh,
I've got a network,
I got to do this,
I would,

644
00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:27.690
I would take a different twist to it.
I would view it as,
I'm like,

645
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:31.480
I just want to have good impact in the world.
I,
you know,
I,

646
00:38:31.481 --> 00:38:32.870
I want to talk to this person,

647
00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:36.310
see if I can be helpful in some way and impart what I,
and by the way,

648
00:38:36.850 --> 00:38:40.820
I learned so much back now from people I used to sit on an airplane.

649
00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:42.430
I would maybe not be so open,

650
00:38:42.431 --> 00:38:47.431
but you pick up so much and opening yourself to the possibilities of what's

651
00:38:47.741 --> 00:38:49.840
around you,
um,

652
00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:54.370
can take you to where you want to go internally and externally.
Yeah,

653
00:38:54.490 --> 00:38:55.480
I mean so much more to talk.

654
00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:57.890
<v 0>I know what you were saying earlier,</v>

655
00:38:57.891 --> 00:39:01.940
totally reminded me of mom's advice where she had said everything you buy owns a

656
00:39:01.941 --> 00:39:03.740
part of you.
Um,

657
00:39:03.741 --> 00:39:08.390
and you know it when you said save and you,
you don't have a large house.

658
00:39:08.391 --> 00:39:12.140
I think that that constricts you and might reduce your confidence to take that

659
00:39:12.141 --> 00:39:12.531
step.

660
00:39:12.531 --> 00:39:17.531
So having that safety net really does impact your ability to maneuver in ways

661
00:39:17.691 --> 00:39:19.160
cause you,
you know,
you have a cushion.

662
00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:24.370
<v 1>I just have very quick question about identifying your niche,
about you,</v>

663
00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:28.850
define your niche.
If you can give us some guidance about how you did it,

664
00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:31.490
then I need any advice on that.
You know,

665
00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:34.490
if you know the space you're in,

666
00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:38.390
and I would kind of imagine all of you do because you,
you're like in it,

667
00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:39.651
by the way,

668
00:39:39.651 --> 00:39:44.651
the best ideas and businesses and stuff come from like your experience.

669
00:39:45.081 --> 00:39:49.040
You,
you stumble across something.
So your niche,
like for me it was,

670
00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:53.030
I really sort of step back,
um,
you know,

671
00:39:53.031 --> 00:39:55.880
I have done grids before.
It was like,
okay,

672
00:39:56.210 --> 00:40:00.650
but if I were boiling it down to the three things that are really me that are

673
00:40:00.651 --> 00:40:04.310
unique,
so I want them to be unique,
compelling,

674
00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:08.420
and like kind of at the forefront of where trends in industry is going,

675
00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:13.670
right so much now is like data and AI and automation and,
uh,
what else?

676
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:16.640
People and talent.
I mean,
it's right.
So,
um,

677
00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:20.110
but there's so many food is going in all sorts of different places,

678
00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:23.180
crazy different places.
So,
so I would,

679
00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:28.690
I would literally crystallize it to three words that define the space that you

680
00:40:29.481 --> 00:40:32.600
know and that you're good at and that,
um,

681
00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:36.710
whether there's value to be had in the market.

682
00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:40.400
So like an overlap between a trend that's happening,

683
00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:43.670
it's something that you're really good at.
Yes.
Yeah.
Does that make sense?

684
00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:47.900
And then the other way to think about it too is if you were going to write an

685
00:40:47.901 --> 00:40:51.470
article right now in the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal and you were

686
00:40:51.471 --> 00:40:53.510
going to like,
leverage what,
you know,
what would you write about?

687
00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:56.510
What would the headline be and what would you talk about?

688
00:40:56.630 --> 00:41:00.110
And I bet your three themes should be like,
you know,

689
00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:04.040
there'll be floating in there.
Right.
Interesting.

690
00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:09.890
<v 4>I heard you say to start it off with a maid or euro 14.
I was,</v>

691
00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:14.040
how did you,
I guess,
go from that situation to like,

692
00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:16.860
even knowing to go on a river?

693
00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:21.370
<v 1>Yeah,
that's a really good,
you know,
I mean,
I feel so blessed today.</v>

694
00:41:21.371 --> 00:41:25.960
I mean I really,
because,
um,
so when I'm having my bad days,
I,
you know,

695
00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:30.580
God,
like I,
you know,
I could have been in a very different situation.

696
00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:32.770
I,
you know,

697
00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:36.800
there's power in education and that's why we do girls with impact because I feel

698
00:41:36.801 --> 00:41:41.390
like if I didn't go to college and even business school really changed my

699
00:41:41.391 --> 00:41:44.420
thinking to a whole more sophisticated level,

700
00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:48.230
change my income like that too.
For most people it does.

701
00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:53.120
And it changes your ability to operate with people on a higher plane,

702
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:57.440
sort of,
um,
you know,
you can sort of argue business school,
there's so much.

703
00:41:57.441 --> 00:41:59.450
But you know,
um,

704
00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:03.470
and I think watching and paying attention to a lot of people.

705
00:42:03.471 --> 00:42:06.860
So small little example and I just pulling something,
you know,
long time ago,

706
00:42:06.861 --> 00:42:10.130
I remember when I was working in politics and a lawyer we worked with and he had

707
00:42:10.131 --> 00:42:14.390
written a book on going to meetings and I read that book and something really

708
00:42:14.391 --> 00:42:18.620
stood with me,
which is now whenever I go to a meeting,
I jot down like,

709
00:42:18.621 --> 00:42:22.370
what do I want to come away with?
And even if I'm going to get rejected,

710
00:42:22.371 --> 00:42:25.670
which like I've been rejected a gazillion times,
it hurts,

711
00:42:25.671 --> 00:42:28.440
but I know it's going to happen.
And I just like,
I,
you know,

712
00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:32.180
hope for the best and prepare for the worst is I still try to come out of

713
00:42:32.181 --> 00:42:36.620
something with that meaning and that could be,
um,
a,

714
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:38.450
a relationship with them because you know what,

715
00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:42.710
that person has a gazillion relationships themselves.
Okay.

716
00:42:42.711 --> 00:42:45.320
And that's happened before I met with somebody,
a VC guy,

717
00:42:45.321 --> 00:42:48.200
and he introduced me to somebody else.
Um,

718
00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:51.680
it could be that they're going to introduce you to somebody.
Okay.
You don't have,

719
00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:54.650
you know,
that's great.
You know,
by the way we do.

720
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:57.860
Do you think there's somebody like I'm meeting here with folks about girls with

721
00:42:57.870 --> 00:42:59.510
impact and um,

722
00:42:59.511 --> 00:43:03.170
I'm having that very conversation because it's a really small world.

723
00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:08.060
Like it's a crazy small world and you never know who you're going to bump into.

724
00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:11.060
Um,
so,
you know,
back to question,
it's like,

725
00:43:11.061 --> 00:43:15.440
it's watching people wanting to do something bigger.
And I,
you know,

726
00:43:15.441 --> 00:43:16.700
it's a combination of luck.

727
00:43:16.701 --> 00:43:21.290
I think it was also partly intentionally looking at the big picture,

728
00:43:21.291 --> 00:43:23.180
the trends and feeling like,
you know,

729
00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:26.360
I think we can be an authority in the space.
Cause I see the trends.

730
00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:30.020
There is no authority on women and money.
They're making more money.

731
00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:33.170
Everybody cares about women.
They're writing the checks.

732
00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:37.400
By golly maybe I have something I'm not great but maybe it will be good enough.

733
00:43:37.610 --> 00:43:40.820
And I knew the strategy of how to come up with a good story,

734
00:43:40.821 --> 00:43:43.730
a good angle and so I'd go on and I was good enough that they,

735
00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:46.520
so things feed on themselves.

736
00:43:46.521 --> 00:43:49.880
And I guess I would say like no matter where you're going is

737
00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:55.610
actually,
we talked about this is the power of telling a good story,

738
00:43:55.611 --> 00:43:58.820
a good whatever it is,
succinctly,

739
00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:02.330
not too long visually when it makes sense.

740
00:44:02.331 --> 00:44:04.040
The visual identity of girls within back,

741
00:44:04.041 --> 00:44:06.410
the guy who did that made all the difference in the world.

742
00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:10.700
Like it's the difference between looking like you have a product and your

743
00:44:10.701 --> 00:44:12.860
professional versus something else.

744
00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:17.900
Buying somebody if you need to like put your best foot forward.
Um,

745
00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:22.040
yeah I love that.
So we'll take one more question.

746
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:24.860
The board skill development

747
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:28.660
in the personal life for the Korean,

748
00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:32.100
there's so many skills you need to learn and then given

749
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:34.260
<v 5>a time we don't have too much time in a day.
No.</v>

750
00:44:34.261 --> 00:44:38.970
So how do we choose the best skill that is most important to us and how do we

751
00:44:38.971 --> 00:44:43.650
strategize to ensure that we are not missing up in some other skill that may

752
00:44:43.651 --> 00:44:46.680
later be important and we may end up in some issues.

753
00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:48.150
This is a big issue that I face.

754
00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:49.450
<v 1>Yeah,
that's a really good.</v>

755
00:44:49.451 --> 00:44:53.830
So how do you develop the best skill given that you have limited time,
right?

756
00:44:53.831 --> 00:44:56.560
To keep yourself current and moving forward.
I mean,

757
00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:58.780
I mean I'm going to come back to it more crystal,

758
00:44:58.781 --> 00:45:01.450
but even like with girls within pack from me,

759
00:45:01.451 --> 00:45:06.130
you know I was in Davos in and saw the trends and and felt like,
you know,

760
00:45:06.131 --> 00:45:10.900
this also keeps me personally at the forefront of innovation and where things

761
00:45:10.901 --> 00:45:14.990
are headed.
So for you I would be thinking,
I would be looking at what,

762
00:45:15.010 --> 00:45:16.690
what do I actually liked doing?

763
00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:20.200
I think he got a really like what you're doing because forget it.
So,

764
00:45:20.410 --> 00:45:24.550
and then I would force herself to narrow it down to like three to five of those.

765
00:45:24.551 --> 00:45:28.180
I really like these.
Then I would probably look at,
okay where's the,

766
00:45:28.181 --> 00:45:31.900
where are the trends going?
Like the skills that are going to be in demand.

767
00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:35.410
And you could,
well you might know that off the top of your head,

768
00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:37.150
you could look at where,
uh,

769
00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:42.180
Google is placing a money and training or looking to buy up companies.

770
00:45:42.610 --> 00:45:47.170
That's the way of doing that,
right?
To our company.
Okay.
Yeah.
Too,
too hardcore.

771
00:45:47.171 --> 00:45:50.920
We search reports,
right.
Um,
or where money is going.

772
00:45:50.921 --> 00:45:53.520
So like cryptocurrency is a big example.
Um,

773
00:45:53.890 --> 00:45:56.950
that would be sort of the other way I would look at doing it.

774
00:45:56.951 --> 00:45:59.020
And then I would think like,
um,

775
00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:03.730
you could even have a conversation with somebody like,
you know,
senior law.

776
00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:05.710
Like could you apply,
could you,

777
00:46:05.890 --> 00:46:10.630
could you develop a skill and apply it to something that would be a value here?

778
00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:14.230
Like in a new effort.
That's kind of interesting cause what does that do?

779
00:46:14.410 --> 00:46:15.430
You build your skill,

780
00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:20.460
you increase your value potentially here and you increase kind of your potential

781
00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:24.520
monetary earning potential.
Um,

782
00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:29.440
and then hopefully it's kind of the skill that's in demand.
But,
uh,
yeah,

783
00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:32.370
I think the overlap with,
you know,
you really have to like it,
it's,

784
00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:37.210
it's such a key you have to like really enjoy it.
Like if you love mob,
you know,

785
00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:40.180
I got to share this,
this is great.
And then we'll wrap it.
But my,

786
00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:44.680
I ha I had this young woman from another country who,

787
00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:47.980
um,
you know,
it's a great story a bit and she ended up working for me.

788
00:46:47.981 --> 00:46:52.120
She works with my husband now and she has her cough colleague who frankly

789
00:46:52.121 --> 00:46:54.280
doesn't really speak much English.
Okay.

790
00:46:54.610 --> 00:46:59.530
But she is a math wizard.
I mean they,

791
00:46:59.531 --> 00:47:04.240
they,
and by the way,
the CEO of this company,
it's a division of a large company.

792
00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:05.890
I mean,
very sophisticated.

793
00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:09.790
They have seen nothing of what this girl has pulled together.

794
00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:14.820
Allowing them to see competitors and where money is going is unbelievable.

795
00:47:14.831 --> 00:47:17.950
So like for example,
that is a great example.

796
00:47:17.951 --> 00:47:22.120
Like if you were like a genius in one particular place,
Andrew liked it.

797
00:47:22.570 --> 00:47:24.160
I would explore that.

798
00:47:24.161 --> 00:47:28.690
And they go where the future demand or the trends are going with things that

799
00:47:28.691 --> 00:47:30.070
we're,
and we read about

800
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:32.890
<v 0>in the headlines.
Yeah.
Double down on the thing that you're good.</v>

801
00:47:32.891 --> 00:47:37.240
I've been in Sony teams where other people are more passionate maybe in a

802
00:47:37.241 --> 00:47:39.400
particular area and there is no way you can compete.
Right.

803
00:47:39.401 --> 00:47:42.160
Cause they're talking to their friends about that subject and the evenings

804
00:47:42.161 --> 00:47:46.090
they're doing something about it on the weekends and here you are just trying to

805
00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:47.830
recover from the week.
Right.

806
00:47:47.831 --> 00:47:50.470
So having that thing that you're interested in is so,
yeah.

807
00:47:50.530 --> 00:47:53.830
<v 1>So helpful.
And so it set a marker again even for that.
So,
okay,</v>

808
00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:56.770
it's not going to be in the next two months maybe,
but over the next year,

809
00:47:56.771 --> 00:48:01.300
each quarter I'm going to do x or I want to get a certificate and acts or you

810
00:48:01.301 --> 00:48:04.990
know,
if Google is really like was just say they were covering something or they

811
00:48:04.991 --> 00:48:08.050
wanted something,
maybe you know,
um,
it,

812
00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:11.950
it can make a difference in putting you into a different role having a certain

813
00:48:11.951 --> 00:48:15.890
skillset.
Yeah,
definitely.
Well thank you so much for joining us.

814
00:48:15.891 --> 00:48:16.990
I really appreciate it.

815
00:48:16.991 --> 00:48:20.530
If people here on the live shame aren't youtube want to get involved with girls

816
00:48:20.550 --> 00:48:21.640
without talking?
They do.

817
00:48:21.641 --> 00:48:25.630
So I want and need all of you to join us with girls with impact please.

818
00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:28.390
Boys and girls,
like whether you look at,

819
00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:33.520
we are all in this together so you can either just help amplify what we're

820
00:48:34.031 --> 00:48:37.060
doing.
Please go to girls with him,
but we're going to send out an email.
Yeah,

821
00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:40.900
you can play a role in supporting a girl to go through the training.

822
00:48:41.170 --> 00:48:45.370
You could also,
if you want,
mentor a girl and we keep it pretty flexible,

823
00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:48.710
not heavy duty because people are all over the place.
Um,

824
00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:52.990
but it's a great way to have a personal legacy and to really join us in

825
00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:58.040
hopefully having a really big legacy.
I hope you all will.
Thank you,
Jennifer.

826
00:48:58.041 --> 00:48:59.020
I really appreciate it.
