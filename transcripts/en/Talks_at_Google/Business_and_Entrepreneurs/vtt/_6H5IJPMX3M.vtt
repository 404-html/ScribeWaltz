1
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.030
Great.
Great.
Well thank you.
And it's great to see all of you.
Um,

2
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.250
and I want to thank Google for the invitation.
I'm,

3
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.560
I'm a fan of the company and have enjoyed working with all of you through the

4
00:00:14.561 --> 00:00:18.670
years,
so it's good to have faces with the company.
So thank you.
Um,

5
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.600
and so in talking to a couple of the folks prior to this event,
uh,

6
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.100
the term intersectionality came up where I think all of you are focusing on the

7
00:00:27.101 --> 00:00:30.610
intersection of all of our different parts of our lives and how that comes

8
00:00:30.611 --> 00:00:32.920
together.
So I'm probably gonna come back to that as we,

9
00:00:32.921 --> 00:00:35.980
as we talk through some of the questions and hopefully take some of your

10
00:00:35.981 --> 00:00:39.070
questions.
But,
um,
just by way of introduction,

11
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.220
think about all the different hats I wear.
I'm,
yes,

12
00:00:42.221 --> 00:00:44.740
I'm an executive during most days.

13
00:00:44.741 --> 00:00:49.060
I'm also a mom of a 15 year old and three well two dogs and one cat.

14
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.560
I'm a wife.
I serve on a,
a national board.

15
00:00:53.561 --> 00:00:57.940
I am the chair of the board of my daughter's private school and I also am a

16
00:00:57.941 --> 00:00:59.380
deacon at my church.

17
00:00:59.381 --> 00:01:04.060
And so you think about all the intersections of the LGBT family,

18
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:05.620
uh,
your work family,

19
00:01:05.621 --> 00:01:08.890
and then all the ways we try to give back to the different parts of our lives

20
00:01:08.891 --> 00:01:09.581
that are important.

21
00:01:09.581 --> 00:01:12.970
So hopefully we can touch on a number of those different areas.

22
00:01:12.971 --> 00:01:16.630
And I probably have other hats that I totally forgot and,
and whatnot,
but a,

23
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.270
but a little bit about my story.
I'm from South Louisiana,

24
00:01:19.271 --> 00:01:23.080
so I am one of the real Cajuns.
Um,
even though my last name doesn't show it,

25
00:01:23.081 --> 00:01:25.990
my mother was a primo and if you have any Cajun jokes,

26
00:01:25.991 --> 00:01:30.460
it's the Tibideau is Boudreau's.
Primos okay.
Um,
so I am,

27
00:01:30.461 --> 00:01:33.670
I'm one of those Cajun folks.
Um,
and so from a very young age,

28
00:01:33.671 --> 00:01:35.800
I always knew I was different from a lot of folks.

29
00:01:35.801 --> 00:01:40.801
So like many of you probably I took upon myself to be like perfect at

30
00:01:40.841 --> 00:01:44.460
everything,
uh,
be the,
uh,
you know,
whatever the,

31
00:01:44.461 --> 00:01:47.740
the head of everything so that once people figure it out that I was different,

32
00:01:47.741 --> 00:01:49.890
they would still kind of maybe like me.
Um,

33
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.620
and so I took that path and I know a lot of people took similar paths in their

34
00:01:53.621 --> 00:01:58.240
life.
Um,
my coming out story is kind of a funny one in that,

35
00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.390
um,
my,
uh,
the,
the,
the story goes like this.

36
00:02:01.391 --> 00:02:06.280
I was at college and my mother called in a panic saying,
oh my God,
Renee,

37
00:02:06.281 --> 00:02:09.520
you're sister is a lesbian,
but I've always known about you,

38
00:02:09.521 --> 00:02:12.880
but really your sister too.
I was like,
well,
great.
Thanks mom.
And he's off.

39
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.310
Um,
so,
uh,
so that's an important part of kind of my story.

40
00:02:18.311 --> 00:02:21.580
My parents went to for two and have a two gay kids.
My,

41
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.780
my sister runs the MCC church,
uh,
for a little bit.
So she's the gay pope.

42
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.090
So you can look up Rochelle Brown and you'll,

43
00:02:28.091 --> 00:02:32.230
you'll recognize the resemblance or at least the voice.
Um,
but throughout,
uh,

44
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.400
throughout my career,
um,
you know,
being a lesbian,

45
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.570
I as you know,
starting in banking,
it's a very conservative,
um,
field.

46
00:02:40.571 --> 00:02:41.830
And so I wasn't,
you know,

47
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.510
out there in my first several roles and it really wasn't until I,
uh,

48
00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.360
my partner and I decided to start a family,

49
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.110
that the whole coming out process started in earnest because if you're pregnant

50
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.580
and you're coming out,

51
00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.430
you have to come out cause you have to explain your relationship.

52
00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.840
And so that really was,
was a real turning point,

53
00:03:01.841 --> 00:03:04.450
not only in my personal life and starting a family,

54
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:07.720
but also in my professional life.
And a lot of people have said,
well,

55
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:11.770
does having a child and,
and coming out,
does it harm your career?

56
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.180
In my situation,

57
00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:17.950
I left on maternity leave as a person on the brand team at Wacovia,
um,

58
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.460
and came back and they immediately said,
you're the head of brand management.

59
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.060
You're a senior vice president.
It starts now.
And it's like,
okay,

60
00:03:25.061 --> 00:03:28.090
I did an interview for anything.
I think that's against a lot of HR policies,

61
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.620
but that,
you know,
I,
I,
you know,
started in and just jumped right in.

62
00:03:32.621 --> 00:03:37.240
So my experience was a very positive one,
um,
on that front.
Um,

63
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.650
but you know,
through my career I've been in,
in financial services,
marketing,
uh,

64
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.440
for a very long time.
And,
um,
I've served in a lot of different roles.

65
00:03:44.441 --> 00:03:48.340
I've had a chance to do a lot of different things across financial services.

66
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.820
And I think a part of that is because I'm really open to taking,

67
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.010
taking on new challenges and new experiences.

68
00:03:54.011 --> 00:03:56.100
And so as we go through some of these questions,
I hope to,

69
00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.190
to share some of that because I think the intersections of all of our

70
00:04:00.191 --> 00:04:02.700
experiences make us a better,
uh,

71
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.970
a better worker for whatever company we're serving at the time.
So anyway,

72
00:04:06.971 --> 00:04:11.170
that's just a little bit more about my story.
Great.
Thank you.
Um,

73
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.320
and could you tell us a little bit more about the leadership role that you're in

74
00:04:14.321 --> 00:04:17.960
now?
Um,
what are you tax tasked with and what kind of team to oversee?

75
00:04:17.961 --> 00:04:21.370
And just to build on your last point,
and it would also love to hear about,

76
00:04:21.371 --> 00:04:21.491
you know,

77
00:04:21.491 --> 00:04:23.920
some of the challenges that you're most excited about approaching and your

78
00:04:23.921 --> 00:04:28.420
current role.
Absolutely.
So I'm,
I'm running marketing for the retail side of Tia.

79
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.700
And so for folks not familiar with Tiaa,

80
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.270
it's a hundred year old company that's known for retirement and helping

81
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.470
universities and not for profits in their retirement space.
Um,

82
00:04:38.471 --> 00:04:42.130
and we just launched into retail.
And so it's a very young part of the company.

83
00:04:42.131 --> 00:04:45.490
It's really a startup with the exception.
We do have an advisor force,

84
00:04:45.491 --> 00:04:48.760
which is very small,
about 850 advisors.
Um,

85
00:04:48.761 --> 00:04:51.220
the last company I left had 15,000 advisors,

86
00:04:51.221 --> 00:04:54.490
so a very different scale and scope and a very different way of going to

87
00:04:54.491 --> 00:04:56.860
business.
Um,
but we just purchased a bank.

88
00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.600
And so we're integrating that bank over the next several weeks.
And,
um,
the,

89
00:05:00.601 --> 00:05:02.750
the goal and what my team is,
uh,

90
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.920
responsible for is figuring out how do we go to market differently.

91
00:05:05.921 --> 00:05:09.700
We're a not for profit organization and how do we go up against the B of a

92
00:05:09.701 --> 00:05:11.940
Merrill,
the chase,
uh,

93
00:05:11.941 --> 00:05:15.910
others in the financial services industry like fidelity and show up differently,

94
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.890
um,
and show our not for profit heritage and,
and,

95
00:05:18.891 --> 00:05:22.150
and really try to disrupt the marketplace.
And so that's a,

96
00:05:22.151 --> 00:05:25.930
that's the challenge I'm taking on now.
I have a small team,
I haven't counted.

97
00:05:25.931 --> 00:05:30.070
I don't know how many people,
probably about 50 people on the team now.
And a,

98
00:05:30.071 --> 00:05:32.050
and it's really exciting because I'm,
so,

99
00:05:32.051 --> 00:05:36.490
I was with Wacovia wells for 20 years and in that whole process,
um,

100
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.190
even in brand management,
we were constantly trying to say,

101
00:05:39.191 --> 00:05:42.470
how is this company different while we're on every street corner?
Uh,

102
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.300
with the wells example,
we have ponies.
If we can give out plush ponies to people,

103
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.030
yes,
that's a thing.
Um,
but there wasn't anything like heart and soul,

104
00:05:52.031 --> 00:05:55.810
whereas Tia has a soul and we're trying to uncover that and like show,

105
00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.120
show this really cool and,
and show how it's different in the market.

106
00:05:59.121 --> 00:06:00.890
So it sounds like it might be easy,

107
00:06:00.891 --> 00:06:03.980
but it's going to be a challenge just with a lot of different structures we
have.

108
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.360
So,
um,
so yeah,

109
00:06:05.361 --> 00:06:08.660
we met with our Google team a little earlier to talk a little bit about that and

110
00:06:08.661 --> 00:06:12.110
so I'm excited about the opportunity.
Awesome.
Um,

111
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.700
and you touched on this a little bit about sort of your promotion during your

112
00:06:16.701 --> 00:06:18.150
maternity leave.
Um,

113
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.400
but what path did you take to your current role at ta and your,
Your path to,

114
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.390
to this?
Um,
Gosh,
um,
I think,
um,
you know,

115
00:06:26.391 --> 00:06:30.890
some people actually had plans for their career and I definitely didn't.
Um,
the,

116
00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:31.221
the,

117
00:06:31.221 --> 00:06:35.660
the only thing consistent with my journey is that I always took on a job no one

118
00:06:35.661 --> 00:06:40.050
else wanted to do.
Um,
and that has been kind of my hallmark and I've,
uh,

119
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.050
discovered that if you raise your hand and do something,

120
00:06:42.051 --> 00:06:43.430
no one else wants to do that.

121
00:06:43.431 --> 00:06:46.700
Your beloved by the management because it's typically something that's hairy,

122
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.120
complicated political and people don't know the answer.

123
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.850
And even if you can get in and move it just a little bit,

124
00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.590
people love you and you're kind of marked with that.
So I started my career,
um,

125
00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.820
on the regular banking side doing tons of integrations in New Orleans for

126
00:07:01.821 --> 00:07:05.570
Hibernia Bank,
which was bought by capital one.
So that's how long ago that was.

127
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.050
But it was fun being single and 26,
I live in near Bourbon Street.

128
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:14.090
And then with Wacovia was on the business,
small business side.

129
00:07:14.091 --> 00:07:16.880
And that was really cool because I got to learn how business bankers go in and

130
00:07:16.881 --> 00:07:20.010
help companies.
And I found that to be very fascinating.
Um,

131
00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:23.330
and then when first union bought Wacovia moved into brand management and that

132
00:07:23.331 --> 00:07:28.040
was a great learning,
a great ability to kind of step back and say,

133
00:07:28.041 --> 00:07:31.070
how can a company be different,
but not just how it's expressed,

134
00:07:31.071 --> 00:07:32.900
but how people actually behave at the company.

135
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.590
And that's where magic can happen with different institutions.
Uh,

136
00:07:36.591 --> 00:07:39.050
but I quickly realized that everyone's a brand expert.

137
00:07:39.051 --> 00:07:40.640
I don't know if y'all know that.
Um,

138
00:07:40.641 --> 00:07:44.630
and I got really burned out with some of the components of branding and so no

139
00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:48.230
one at the company wanted to support the financial advisors.
Um,

140
00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:52.310
and because they are known as cowboys and cowgirls and mean people,
and I'm like,

141
00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:55.130
I'll take that on.
So I went and got my series seven and I'm like,
okay,

142
00:07:55.131 --> 00:07:58.850
I'm going to do this whole brokerage thing and retirement asset management.

143
00:07:58.851 --> 00:08:03.260
And I did that for seven years,
uh,
pre and post merger.
So I'm with Wells Fargo.

144
00:08:03.261 --> 00:08:06.650
And so that was,
that was really great learning.
Did the AG Edwards integration,

145
00:08:06.651 --> 00:08:09.350
that was the biggest brokerage integration in history.
I was awesome.

146
00:08:09.351 --> 00:08:12.850
Learned so much.
Um,
and then after that,
um,
I,

147
00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:15.130
I raised my hand for another problem.
Um,

148
00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:18.560
which was a wells Fargo social media was a disaster.

149
00:08:18.561 --> 00:08:22.670
And so the board was kind of standing on,
uh,
the management and said,

150
00:08:22.671 --> 00:08:24.050
you guys have to centralize this,

151
00:08:24.051 --> 00:08:26.240
which the company didn't centralize anything at the time.

152
00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:29.610
So I was the person who brought social media to gather and,

153
00:08:29.611 --> 00:08:30.770
and that was really fun.

154
00:08:30.771 --> 00:08:34.250
I kinda got out of marketing for those few years because as you know,

155
00:08:34.251 --> 00:08:37.490
standing up a social media platform for a company that large,

156
00:08:37.491 --> 00:08:42.320
you're dealing with HR issues because employees love posting things that they

157
00:08:42.321 --> 00:08:45.290
should not post.
Um,
and,
and um,

158
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:49.940
PR and it was a lot less marketing than it was some of the like managing kinds

159
00:08:49.941 --> 00:08:52.250
of things.
And so,
um,
I,
I,

160
00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:54.980
the last role I had at wells was actually in the community bank.

161
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.470
All of you know where that is right now,
so I'm happy to be a ta ta.

162
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:01.080
So,
you know,
I mean,

163
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:05.520
each of those twists and turns involved some component of no one wanted to touch

164
00:09:05.521 --> 00:09:07.230
it.
Like my last role,
community banking,

165
00:09:07.231 --> 00:09:10.260
no one wanted to touch that because everyone knew there were problems and things

166
00:09:10.261 --> 00:09:13.590
were getting ready to blow up and that's what happened.
Um,
so

167
00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.680
<v 2>yeah.
Does that help?
Yes.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

168
00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:22.480
what was the,
just taking a step even further back,
um,

169
00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:26.590
what was the first job that you ever had and did you imagine in that job that

170
00:09:26.591 --> 00:09:28.810
you would find yourself here in this current role?

171
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:35.360
<v 0>I think all of you would say the same thing.
Um,
I would assume so.
I had my,</v>

172
00:09:35.361 --> 00:09:39.890
I started my first job at the age of 16 on my birthday at 6:00 AM I was a radio

173
00:09:39.891 --> 00:09:43.280
announcer and the reason is my sister was radio announcer and we sound a lot

174
00:09:43.281 --> 00:09:48.040
alike.
And so that's how I got my first job because I sounded like my sister.
Um,

175
00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:51.740
but she continued in radio for a lot longer than than I did.
But,
um,
that,

176
00:09:51.741 --> 00:09:53.830
that was really great.
I learned a lot.
I,

177
00:09:53.831 --> 00:09:57.890
I did radio announcing from that age into college and I was actually a traffic

178
00:09:57.891 --> 00:10:01.360
reporter in baton rouge where there's awful traffic if,

179
00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:02.870
if y'all have ever been through there,
you know,

180
00:10:02.871 --> 00:10:06.290
but I actually flew in the airplane every morning and every night and I was

181
00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:10.020
uptown Renee brown for a long time,
um,

182
00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:14.090
through graduate school and,
and you know,
every job I ever did.

183
00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:17.690
And during college I was,
I took any job I could work my way through college.

184
00:10:17.691 --> 00:10:22.160
I was a receptionist for an architectural firm.
I worked at the library,
you know,

185
00:10:22.161 --> 00:10:23.090
you name it just to,

186
00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:26.600
to get money because believe it or not being a radio announcer written very

187
00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.230
lucrative.
Um,
but what I learned,
uh,

188
00:10:30.231 --> 00:10:34.670
announcing traffic in particular is you have 30 seconds and you know,

189
00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.500
sometimes you'd have to interstate shut down.

190
00:10:36.501 --> 00:10:38.900
You had all this stuff to say and you had 30 seconds to get it done.

191
00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:41.360
And how did that translate some my later jobs,

192
00:10:41.361 --> 00:10:44.300
I mean some of my roles and you've all experienced that,
you know,

193
00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:49.370
you go in for a big presentation with somebody and they want the 32nd version.

194
00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:52.910
And so to have that experience of saying,
okay,
I have 30 seconds,

195
00:10:52.911 --> 00:10:56.240
what are the three things I can say in 30 seconds?
And believe it or not,

196
00:10:56.241 --> 00:10:59.780
that has been very helpful for my career.
So even though,
you know,

197
00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:03.530
knowing media and that side of media has been helpful for my marketing career,

198
00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:07.430
um,
that's the piece that probably was the biggest learning for me as a,

199
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:09.020
as a younger person growing up.

200
00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:13.130
But I did also learn a lot and radio of exactly what not to do from an HR sexual

201
00:11:13.131 --> 00:11:14.060
harassment standpoint,

202
00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:19.680
<v 2>very different industries.
Um,</v>

203
00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:23.060
and then pivoting towards,
and again,

204
00:11:23.061 --> 00:11:26.530
you're an out LGBTQ identifying woman.
Um,

205
00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:31.570
how do you feel like identifying as an Lgbtq woman or generally more broader as

206
00:11:31.851 --> 00:11:36.290
a woman has positively or negatively affected your career in your,
your growth?

207
00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:38.170
<v 0>You know,
I think,
um,</v>

208
00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:42.700
one thing that's true across LGBT and other diverse segments is I think,
um,

209
00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:47.760
people gain more empathy growing up when you are the subordinated group for the

210
00:11:47.801 --> 00:11:50.850
majority of your upbringing or your lifetime.
Um,

211
00:11:50.851 --> 00:11:55.000
and so understanding what it feels like to not in the dominant group and having

212
00:11:55.001 --> 00:11:57.860
empathy and,
and tracking.
Because I used to,
um,

213
00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:00.400
pay attention a lot to people's emotions in the room.

214
00:12:00.401 --> 00:12:03.310
I think some of you probably have experienced that too,

215
00:12:03.311 --> 00:12:06.460
to kind of sense when things are going in the wrong direction and redirect them.

216
00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:07.800
Um,
and,

217
00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:12.250
and so I think that empathy is critical for anybody who's a leader of people to

218
00:12:12.251 --> 00:12:15.730
really understand how to read a situation and,
and use that,

219
00:12:15.731 --> 00:12:20.350
that level of empathy and also knowing how to be,
um,
both,
uh,

220
00:12:20.351 --> 00:12:23.830
aware when you're in the dominant group.
And how do you help people that aren't,

221
00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:26.770
is,
is an awareness level that a lot of people don't have.

222
00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:30.190
Because usually when you're in a dominant group and you have power and authority

223
00:12:30.191 --> 00:12:32.840
and all that stuff,
you're unaware of it.
And,

224
00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:34.930
and the best place to look at this as airport.

225
00:12:34.931 --> 00:12:36.100
We were kidding around about airports.

226
00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:41.460
It's so fun when like something happens and everyone gets messed up with a

227
00:12:41.711 --> 00:12:42.071
flight.

228
00:12:42.071 --> 00:12:47.020
It's fun to watch the super privileged people freak out and just lose their mind

229
00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:51.220
because they're being inconvenienced.
And that's a sure example of,
you know,

230
00:12:51.221 --> 00:12:54.350
people who are very unaware that they have all this privilege.
Um,

231
00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:56.140
and once they're put in a position without it,

232
00:12:56.141 --> 00:12:59.560
they don't even know how to deal with the world around them.
And so I think,

233
00:12:59.561 --> 00:13:04.510
you know,
for me,
um,
being an LGBT leader and a,
and a female leader,
um,
you know,

234
00:13:04.511 --> 00:13:09.490
I kind of try to carry all that background of when I wasn't an executive and I

235
00:13:09.491 --> 00:13:14.140
didn't have the power or authority and how do I use that for good as I've,

236
00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.150
as I've moved through my career

237
00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:18.140
<v 2>career.
Great.
Um,</v>

238
00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:21.110
do you recall a moment in your career,

239
00:13:21.111 --> 00:13:25.790
in your life when you realize that being visibly out would actually be an asset

240
00:13:25.791 --> 00:13:27.110
to you,
either as a,

241
00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:31.400
in your career or in your work with nonprofits on boards,
etc.

242
00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:35.450
<v 0>Yeah,
you know,
I,
I think probably the,
the moment when,
you know,</v>

243
00:13:35.451 --> 00:13:37.560
for a long time I was the executive sponsor of,

244
00:13:37.561 --> 00:13:41.870
of LGBT groups at Wacovia and then at wells and when we transitioned over to

245
00:13:41.871 --> 00:13:44.330
wells,
there was a lot of conversation and,
and uh,

246
00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.900
no one really wanted to go talk to the head of compensation around the whole

247
00:13:47.901 --> 00:13:51.810
gross up.
This was before domestic when we had domestic partner benefits and,

248
00:13:51.811 --> 00:13:56.120
and you needed to gross up people's tax taxes on healthcare for their partners.

249
00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:59.900
Um,
and,
and that was the moment where I realized I had access,

250
00:13:59.901 --> 00:14:04.040
I knew the head of HR,
I knew this guy in compensation and the people in the,

251
00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:08.090
in the Erg didn't have that access.
And it's like,
okay,
this is,

252
00:14:08.091 --> 00:14:12.230
this is a win win because I can go knock on a door and open a door and have a

253
00:14:12.231 --> 00:14:15.410
conversation that's different because we're working with one another on

254
00:14:15.411 --> 00:14:19.910
different things,
not just this.
Um,
and so that's,
that's a real asset.

255
00:14:19.911 --> 00:14:20.641
And what I found,

256
00:14:20.641 --> 00:14:24.260
I have found through the years is a lot of times there are LGBT folks who are

257
00:14:24.261 --> 00:14:25.760
not out at higher levels.

258
00:14:25.761 --> 00:14:28.790
And that's a real shame because they're missing an opportunity and,
and,

259
00:14:28.791 --> 00:14:32.030
and you know,
other diverse groups aren't as supportive one to another.

260
00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:35.320
And that's a shame because that's where we can really have a voice and,

261
00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:38.610
and be able to have conversations differently.
And so,
um,

262
00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:41.810
that's how I've seen it as an asset,
as to open doors for others who,

263
00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.220
who weren't able to do that.

264
00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:46.100
<v 2>Um,</v>

265
00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:50.600
have you ever experienced adversity and kind of the converse side as a result of

266
00:14:50.601 --> 00:14:52.040
being out work?
And would you

267
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.440
<v 0>be okay sharing one of those stories with us?
Sure.</v>

268
00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:59.110
And this is probably less at work.
It's probably more,
um,
uh,

269
00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:02.750
a side effect of being so comfortable at the office.
And so,
um,

270
00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:07.280
this situation happened.
I don't know what the year was,
but I was,
um,

271
00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:10.980
getting in a taxi and Saint Louis heading to the airport.
Um,
uh,
you know,

272
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.690
the Ag Edwards,
now wells Fargo Securities Headquarters is in St Louis.

273
00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.210
And so I'm getting the taxi,
you know,

274
00:15:17.211 --> 00:15:20.120
normal chit chat conversation with the driver.
And he said,
okay,

275
00:15:20.121 --> 00:15:22.040
so what does your husband do?
I said,
I don't have a husband,

276
00:15:22.041 --> 00:15:24.920
I have a wife and she stays home with our child.

277
00:15:24.921 --> 00:15:29.921
And he left the interstate and went someplace that I knew wasn't on the way to

278
00:15:30.291 --> 00:15:31.790
the airport.
So I realized,
great,

279
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:35.570
I just totally got some guide and he's going to go chop me up and little bits

280
00:15:35.571 --> 00:15:39.460
and pieces.
And so I immediately got on the phone with HR and just to,

281
00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:41.600
I was just chatting with my HR partner cause I'm like,

282
00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:44.690
I'm going to be on the phone with somebody while whatever happens happens.

283
00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:47.810
And he wound up driving through a park and then getting back on track.

284
00:15:47.811 --> 00:15:52.490
But he was very,
he did not appreciate the fact that I was very out and,

285
00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:55.280
and honest about,
you know,
my personal situation.

286
00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:59.620
And so that was like lesson for me,
like within the walls of your workplace.

287
00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:03.890
You can be very honest and sometimes in other places it's good to say,
you know,

288
00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:07.940
um,
whatever,
not answer the question.
Um,
but yeah,
that was,

289
00:16:07.941 --> 00:16:12.560
that was one big learning for me.
That got me a little bit worried.
Am I can,

290
00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:17.810
I can definitely say I've had similar Uber experiences.
Um,
yeah.
Uh,

291
00:16:17.811 --> 00:16:22.610
how do you and your wife and Balance Your career and your family?
You know,

292
00:16:22.611 --> 00:16:26.390
I don't know if if,
um,
there ever really is work life balance.

293
00:16:26.391 --> 00:16:28.480
A lot of people ask that question and um,

294
00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:31.700
I think there's times of throttling up where you're completely out of balance

295
00:16:31.701 --> 00:16:34.340
and it's needed at whatever time that is in your career.
I mean,

296
00:16:34.341 --> 00:16:36.980
if you fundamentally change jobs or change companies,

297
00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:39.500
it's not like you're going to have a whole lot of work life balance.

298
00:16:39.501 --> 00:16:41.300
And so I think it's important just to name that,

299
00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:45.140
but you can't always have the out of balance kind of situation.

300
00:16:45.141 --> 00:16:48.560
And it's not always throttling up and spending 20 hours a day.

301
00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:53.360
And so we have routines like many others.
Um,
you know,

302
00:16:53.361 --> 00:16:56.370
whether it's the Sunday evening dinners or,
um,

303
00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:59.900
another work life balance thing is,
is actually turning the phone off.

304
00:16:59.901 --> 00:17:02.690
I do stop in the evenings and have some quiet time,

305
00:17:02.691 --> 00:17:07.130
particularly as my daughter has gotten older now,
she's 15.
She's taller than me.

306
00:17:07.131 --> 00:17:09.230
She's smarter than me.
Literally.
She,

307
00:17:09.231 --> 00:17:13.590
her sat score is way better than mine was as a senior already.
And so,
um,

308
00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:17.150
but it's harder to have a team talk to you.

309
00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:21.200
And so we have to really make time and have quiet time as a family in the

310
00:17:21.201 --> 00:17:23.980
evenings to actually have a conversation happen.
Um,

311
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.620
and then the other piece is we do take vacations and so I was telling them I'm

312
00:17:27.621 --> 00:17:30.680
heading out next Wednesday,
which is a little stressful.
Um,

313
00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:33.350
we're going to go on a two week vacation and that's,
um,

314
00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:36.640
it's critical to actually get some downtime,
um,
because you know,

315
00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:41.480
it's easy to let both relationship and family kind of fall apart with all the

316
00:17:41.481 --> 00:17:45.260
things pulling at you from your work.
And so we try not to have that happen.

317
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:49.040
I don't know if we're successful all the time though.
No one's no one's perfect.

318
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:56.340
<v 2>And you had mentioned your sister and also that you serve as a deacon for,</v>

319
00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:57.480
um,
your church.

320
00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:01.920
How does religion come into your life and especially since it can oftentimes be

321
00:18:01.921 --> 00:18:03.030
perceived as,

322
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:08.510
but by members of the Lgbtq community as being at times at odds with being LGBTQ

323
00:18:09.631 --> 00:18:11.190
identified and being open about it.

324
00:18:11.191 --> 00:18:16.110
So we'd love to hear how you address that with your own identity and with your

325
00:18:16.111 --> 00:18:17.950
own faith.
Yeah,
I thought that would,
it would

326
00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:21.430
<v 0>be an interesting area and I don't know if that's something all of you have seen</v>

327
00:18:21.431 --> 00:18:25.210
at Google but with other other companies and other Erg is working without an

328
00:18:25.211 --> 00:18:27.130
equal for example.
It's,

329
00:18:27.131 --> 00:18:32.131
it's interesting that as companies expand and get faith [inaudible] that people

330
00:18:32.231 --> 00:18:36.490
see that there'd be a conflict between a faith employee resource group and an

331
00:18:36.491 --> 00:18:41.050
LGBT resource group or LGBT and military has all kinds of like interesting

332
00:18:41.051 --> 00:18:44.590
thoughts around different diverse groups and where they might agree or disagree

333
00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:46.510
and have a very different perspective on it.

334
00:18:46.511 --> 00:18:49.200
Particularly in the last year and a half.
Um,

335
00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:52.370
as we've seen all diverse groups attacked,
um,

336
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:57.250
equally by the administration,
by parts of the media where,

337
00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:00.310
you know,
if you're a person with disability,
somebody is picking on you,

338
00:19:00.311 --> 00:19:04.840
you're person of color,
LGBT,
you name it,
everyone seems to be under attack.

339
00:19:04.841 --> 00:19:08.290
And so as we think about all these different degree diverse groups,

340
00:19:08.291 --> 00:19:12.370
I think we as a collective need to figure out how to work together and,

341
00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:15.880
and really help the cause of anybody who's diverse.

342
00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.910
And so I think that's critical and I don't think we've figured it out.
I mean,

343
00:19:18.911 --> 00:19:21.310
if you think of all the diverse groups in the country,

344
00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:22.960
if we all actually got together,

345
00:19:22.961 --> 00:19:26.590
we would have a huge voice against what's happening in our society right now.

346
00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:30.400
And,
and folks who aren't doing that.
And I think it's,
it's a,
it's an opportunity.

347
00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.920
Um,
and with religion specifically,

348
00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:36.670
that's where I've had the most dialogue across difference with folks because I

349
00:19:36.671 --> 00:19:41.671
welcome people having a conversation who might feel like their religion says

350
00:19:41.801 --> 00:19:44.800
that they can't support LGBT Q folks.

351
00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:48.340
And so those have been difficult conversations,
but everyone has,

352
00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:52.210
has helped kind of move forward just a little bit.
Um,
my upbringing,

353
00:19:52.211 --> 00:19:57.010
I spent three days a week in a church that,
that,
um,
really thought LGBT folks,

354
00:19:57.011 --> 00:19:59.980
we're going to hell and set at seven,
said it frequently.
So I was,

355
00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:04.030
I was damaged by my early childhood religious experience.

356
00:20:04.031 --> 00:20:07.240
And so it wasn't until we started a family and my,

357
00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:09.500
my wife made me go to church.
Um,

358
00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:13.360
and we shopped for a church and found one and it took,
you know,

359
00:20:13.361 --> 00:20:16.810
years of healing honestly to be in a church that,
um,

360
00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:18.490
basically feels the same way.

361
00:20:18.491 --> 00:20:22.780
Pro Pope Francis fields is that all of us are made in God's image and loved

362
00:20:22.781 --> 00:20:24.600
equally.
And,
and um,

363
00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:28.570
it takes a long time to heal from some of the scars if you've heard other tapes

364
00:20:28.571 --> 00:20:32.260
in your head throughout outre upbringing.
And so I just wanted to name that.

365
00:20:32.261 --> 00:20:36.770
And then my sister being a minister and,
and uh,
reverend and leading a church,
um,

366
00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:39.310
I think it's important and important thing to name.

367
00:20:39.311 --> 00:20:44.290
Cause I know other LGBT folks who left any semblance of faith out of their lives

368
00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:47.590
for any number of reasons.
Um,
you know,
pride parades,

369
00:20:47.591 --> 00:20:49.750
people hollering and screaming at you,
things like that.

370
00:20:49.751 --> 00:20:53.170
It can be very disconcerting,
but you know,
times have changed.

371
00:20:53.171 --> 00:20:56.830
And I think it's time for us to have good dialogue and a real understanding of

372
00:20:56.831 --> 00:20:59.570
different areas of faith and open up,
you know,

373
00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:04.650
dialogue between an Lgbtq Erg and a faith Erg and,

374
00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:09.640
and be visible in that because to say I'm a Christian Lesbian Christian,

375
00:21:09.641 --> 00:21:12.130
I'm very comfortable saying that,
uh,
now,
uh,

376
00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:14.890
now years ago I wasn't for any number of reasons,

377
00:21:14.891 --> 00:21:18.070
but I just think that's an important dialogue that a lot of companies aren't,

378
00:21:18.071 --> 00:21:19.450
aren't having that conversation.

379
00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.280
<v 2>And it sounds like also,
you know,</v>

380
00:21:21.281 --> 00:21:23.170
based on your earlier come and go out with a story,

381
00:21:23.171 --> 00:21:27.440
then it's something your sister also deals with and her faith as well.
Yeah.
Yup.

382
00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:29.980
Yup.
Great.
Um,

383
00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:34.600
and you also touched on this in terms of working together as different minority

384
00:21:34.601 --> 00:21:39.190
groups.
Um,
but how do you,
it's easy to talk about in practice,
you know,
like how,

385
00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:39.740
you know,

386
00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:43.780
or in theory of how do at different employee resource groups work together.

387
00:21:43.781 --> 00:21:46.840
How do different minority groups work together and you know,
their,

388
00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:50.710
their strength together is greater than the sum of each of the individual parts.

389
00:21:50.711 --> 00:21:51.940
But,
you know,
how does that,

390
00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:55.270
how does it work and how can employee resource groups and different minority

391
00:21:55.271 --> 00:21:59.230
groups work together effectively to advocate for one another and you see that

392
00:21:59.231 --> 00:21:59.850
working?

393
00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:04.620
<v 0>I think having a common set of goals is probably the most critical component.</v>

394
00:22:04.621 --> 00:22:06.300
And,
and having,
um,

395
00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:11.460
we've had so many events in society of late that could be rallying cries for

396
00:22:11.461 --> 00:22:15.270
groups of different Erg has to come together and do an event or,

397
00:22:15.271 --> 00:22:19.170
or have some kind of activity that could be meaningful.
Um,
you know,

398
00:22:19.171 --> 00:22:21.330
you think of Charlottesville and,
and what,

399
00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:26.190
what are the Lgbtq ers doing when situations like that happen?

400
00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:29.840
And I think that's the consciousness that needs to kind of come up.
Um,

401
00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:34.860
I've seen some companies pull members of each of the diverse args and have

402
00:22:35.431 --> 00:22:39.120
dialogue across those,
um,
like,
um,
you know,

403
00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.550
the Asian American group,
um,

404
00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:46.230
to include parts of the world that someone might think a military person might

405
00:22:46.231 --> 00:22:48.810
not want to sit by them.
Um,
or you know,

406
00:22:48.811 --> 00:22:51.870
have an Lgbtq military veteran,

407
00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:56.100
have a conversation with somebody in a faith group,
you know,

408
00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:58.850
all of those kind of mixing and matching this diverse it,

409
00:22:58.851 --> 00:23:01.180
it kind of creates a tension.
Um,

410
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:04.770
and so having panels like that is something that I would recommend.
Um,

411
00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.320
and then with my work with out and equal,

412
00:23:07.321 --> 00:23:11.420
we're doing a lot of focus on companies who are international in scope because,

413
00:23:11.421 --> 00:23:14.020
um,
as you know,
as you move out of the US,

414
00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:17.610
there are a lot of countries where if you move different employees around and

415
00:23:17.611 --> 00:23:21.310
they aren't out,
it can be very challenging for them.
Um,

416
00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:24.540
in countries where you could get killed for being LGBT.

417
00:23:24.541 --> 00:23:29.040
And so we're working through trying to help give resources to institutions on

418
00:23:29.041 --> 00:23:34.041
how do you facilitate those kinds of interactions and how do you work in a

419
00:23:34.051 --> 00:23:38.650
country like India that has laws that prohibit a lot of,
um,
uh,

420
00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:43.500
you know,
openness around people's,
um,
you know,
Lgbtq orientation.

421
00:23:43.501 --> 00:23:45.790
So,
um,
that's,
that's it.

422
00:23:45.791 --> 00:23:48.890
An emerging space that isn't going to change because our world keeps getting

423
00:23:48.891 --> 00:23:53.180
smaller and smaller and,
and those kinds of issues will continue to come up.
Um,

424
00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:58.070
and also the other thing I'd name that that is,
uh,
uh,
a growing space is,

425
00:23:58.071 --> 00:24:02.520
is the,
our,
our next generation,
which I'm sure all of you have plenty of,
um,

426
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:06.440
Gen z here at the Google headquarters.
Um,
you know,

427
00:24:06.441 --> 00:24:10.910
when we think about that generation,
the,
the gender fluidity and,

428
00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:12.330
and issues at,

429
00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:16.430
at work around that and the lack of understanding of senior leaders of most

430
00:24:16.431 --> 00:24:19.700
companies around that space is,
is really critical.
I mean,

431
00:24:19.701 --> 00:24:23.180
I've gotten some questions that I.
Dot.
I didn't even know the answer to,

432
00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:25.910
which is my own learning that I have to keep,

433
00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:30.500
keep growing and learning in that space.
Um,
so anyway,
um,
that's,
that's,

434
00:24:30.501 --> 00:24:34.100
those are all areas that I know out in equals focused on and a lot of companies

435
00:24:34.101 --> 00:24:38.510
are trying to make sure there is education and understanding across that.
Yeah.

436
00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:41.880
And actually touching on the out and equal piece again,
um,

437
00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:45.680
how does your position as an executive affect how you approach organizations

438
00:24:45.681 --> 00:24:50.120
like out of an equal,
your service there and other causes that you support?
Yeah.

439
00:24:50.121 --> 00:24:51.590
You know,
um,
I,

440
00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:55.230
I have served on the board of the Red Cross for years and,

441
00:24:55.231 --> 00:24:58.670
and part of the reason for that is just a being from south Louisiana and having

442
00:24:58.671 --> 00:25:02.300
hurricanes in the backyard every,
every weekend just about,
um,
and,

443
00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:07.160
and seeing the fact that that organization is always there for people no matter

444
00:25:07.161 --> 00:25:07.891
what.
And,

445
00:25:07.891 --> 00:25:12.050
and the Red Cross and Red Crescent internationally as an amazing organization.

446
00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:17.030
Um,
and I just kind of,
my values,
I share values with that organization.

447
00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:21.050
Um,
I moved from that group over to out and equal and it's been a really great

448
00:25:21.051 --> 00:25:21.880
learning for me.

449
00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:25.670
And one of the things I've appreciated is just the ability to meet people across

450
00:25:25.671 --> 00:25:28.790
industries who are making a difference in their organizations and,

451
00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:32.840
and helping not only LGBTQ causes but a lot of others.
Um,

452
00:25:32.841 --> 00:25:34.890
and so that's been invaluable for me.
Um,

453
00:25:34.891 --> 00:25:38.960
and in fact that organization out in equal just had a new CEO come in.

454
00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:40.460
Really exciting.
We're going to be,

455
00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:44.960
I'm having a strategic offsite and Disney in a month and I'm looking forward to

456
00:25:44.961 --> 00:25:45.291
that.

457
00:25:45.291 --> 00:25:48.560
I think we're going to blaze a new path because out in equals known for their

458
00:25:48.561 --> 00:25:51.770
summit,
which is going to be in Seattle in October.
Um,

459
00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:55.280
but also we have to do more webinars.
We have a lot more education.

460
00:25:55.281 --> 00:25:58.220
There's a lot more that we have to do and catch up with the times because you

461
00:25:58.221 --> 00:26:01.190
guys know in person summit's a really hard for people to get to.

462
00:26:01.191 --> 00:26:05.270
Of course the gamblers have always been allowed group at summits.
I will,

463
00:26:05.271 --> 00:26:10.220
I will give you that.
I could take that.
Um,
and so,
um,
anyway,
um,

464
00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:14.630
so yeah,
and,
and you know,
uh,
I find,
uh,
board work,

465
00:26:14.631 --> 00:26:18.920
whether I helped our church with long range planning or I'm now leading the

466
00:26:18.921 --> 00:26:21.230
board of my daughter's school as I mentioned,
um,

467
00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:24.110
I find that a great distraction and a great learning.

468
00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:26.210
So I'm oftentimes when life,

469
00:26:26.211 --> 00:26:30.170
so I've been in marketing a million years and it's not that I'm not learning in

470
00:26:30.171 --> 00:26:34.710
the role,
but,
um,
I don't get to get out of that box as often.
So,
um,

471
00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:38.360
right now our school is buying property and going through all the rezoning and

472
00:26:38.361 --> 00:26:40.940
doing all kinds of things that it's like I don't have a chance to do that.

473
00:26:40.941 --> 00:26:45.340
So I find it stimulating and interesting.
Um,
and also it,
it,

474
00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:48.990
it helps to put a face with that group in particular,

475
00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:54.470
a phase to the LGBT world in a different way for those parents of other kids.

476
00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:59.570
And I think we have to do that.
We have to be out in our communities and,
um,

477
00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:02.400
serving in roles that might not be as expected.

478
00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:05.550
And I think it just helps people know.
It's like,
okay,
me and my wife,

479
00:27:05.551 --> 00:27:09.030
we have kind of the same life that all the other parents around the table have.

480
00:27:09.031 --> 00:27:10.950
We are,
uh,
you know,
doing the best we can.

481
00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:14.800
I'm trying to deal with all the things that you faced with a teenager and I'm

482
00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:18.090
comparing notes on does this work or not?
Um,
you know,

483
00:27:18.091 --> 00:27:20.790
going through the circle of life and to share that with,
um,

484
00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:25.830
with people who are not in our core Lgbtq community is critical.
So,
um,

485
00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:29.130
I,
I,
and I also,
I learned a lot from the process.

486
00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:34.640
<v 2>Great.
And I know we,
that was the end of my formal questions here,
but,
um,</v>

487
00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:38.320
I know we had some questions with a dory and I think one of them in particular,

488
00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:42.400
um,
just to touch back on a comment that you'd made earlier was about advice that

489
00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:47.050
you would give to young people in your career.
And you had mentioned that,
um,

490
00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:48.580
specifically in your career,

491
00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:51.640
you always found it to be very helpful to take on kind of that big hairy role

492
00:27:51.641 --> 00:27:53.500
that no one wanted to take on.

493
00:27:53.501 --> 00:27:56.530
So I'd love to hear a little bit more about sort of,
you know,
the,

494
00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:00.490
obviously there's a huge opportunity that comes with taking on something that's

495
00:28:00.491 --> 00:28:01.390
challenging and,

496
00:28:01.391 --> 00:28:05.440
and potentially has high visibility but also a lot of risk associated with that.

497
00:28:05.441 --> 00:28:09.130
So we'd love to hear a little bit more about how you've also balanced kind of

498
00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:12.750
the risk associated with taking some of those challenging roles,
uh,

499
00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:14.870
along with the opportunity.
Yeah,
and

500
00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:15.091
<v 0>you know,</v>

501
00:28:15.091 --> 00:28:19.080
probably taking on social media and wells was probably the highest stakes one.

502
00:28:19.081 --> 00:28:21.480
The ones prior to that were more,
okay,

503
00:28:21.481 --> 00:28:24.780
no one that's a gap that needs to be filled and I'm going to go fill that gap.

504
00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:27.780
Um,
but,
but in that role,
it was really,

505
00:28:27.781 --> 00:28:31.470
really clear that the company was on the wrong path and they were like huge

506
00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:35.280
issues going on.
Um,
that if any auditor would come in,

507
00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:37.800
it would be a flaming disaster.
In fact,

508
00:28:37.801 --> 00:28:40.920
our internal audit showed up two weeks after I started and freaked me out

509
00:28:40.921 --> 00:28:44.760
completely.
So instead of resisting them,
I just brought him in and said,
okay,

510
00:28:44.761 --> 00:28:48.240
here's everything I've seen.
Um,
you know,
we have no exit strategies,

511
00:28:48.241 --> 00:28:52.770
we have no strategies for any platform,
we have no controls,
no governance.

512
00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:56.250
It was just,
you know,
you name it,
everything that would freak somebody out.
And,

513
00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.130
and I,
I took it as an opportunity to say audit,

514
00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:01.170
can you help me put this together in the right way?

515
00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:03.150
And they did and they were fabulous and they only,

516
00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:07.950
they didn't dig me too badly on that,
um,
on that survey.
But it was a huge risk.

517
00:29:07.951 --> 00:29:10.980
And the way I balanced that as,
as I took the role on,

518
00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:14.610
I went and talked to several executives at the company and I said,
look,

519
00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:19.970
there's a lot of people see this as play time or not serious or something to be

520
00:29:20.221 --> 00:29:23.430
controlled.
And you guys know,
social media can't be controlled.

521
00:29:23.431 --> 00:29:28.410
And that was part of my challenge is talking to the baby boomers who were trying

522
00:29:28.411 --> 00:29:31.050
to control the,
the,
the younger generation.

523
00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:33.390
And it was so clear that you can't control it.

524
00:29:33.391 --> 00:29:35.790
And it's so clear also in our society,

525
00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:40.410
things can be right and wrong at the same time depending on what perspective you

526
00:29:40.411 --> 00:29:44.950
take on issue.
And so translating that was a critical part of my role.

527
00:29:44.951 --> 00:29:47.770
But I talked to a lot of executives and just said,
how do I,

528
00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:50.440
how do I take on this,
this effort?

529
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:55.470
And the resoundingly feedback that I got is used risk as the key because if you

530
00:29:57.161 --> 00:30:00.910
can outline all the risks associated with what's happening and how to mitigate

531
00:30:00.911 --> 00:30:04.240
them,
they're going to give you a blank check.
And that's exactly what happened.

532
00:30:04.241 --> 00:30:08.590
The company said,
okay,
what,
what number do you need?
And so we were eight.

533
00:30:08.591 --> 00:30:09.610
We opened,
you know,

534
00:30:09.611 --> 00:30:14.200
command centers on both coasts and set up the entire system the way it should be

535
00:30:14.201 --> 00:30:14.621
set up.

536
00:30:14.621 --> 00:30:18.730
And the really unfortunate thing about that is the command centers weren't used

537
00:30:18.731 --> 00:30:22.120
until everyone found out about sales practices issues at the company.

538
00:30:22.121 --> 00:30:25.390
And so that was a,
that was when the command centers really came into use.

539
00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:28.360
But I'm glad,
at least I was there to put that together for the company.

540
00:30:28.361 --> 00:30:31.270
I would have preferred the company use those for something really positive as

541
00:30:31.271 --> 00:30:36.130
opposed to,
um,
a huge,
uh,
Dang for the brand that they may never recover from.

542
00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:37.960
Now.
Um,
but you know,
that was,

543
00:30:37.961 --> 00:30:42.670
that was the biggest risk in taking on something that was Harry.
Um,
and I think,

544
00:30:42.671 --> 00:30:45.800
you know,
getting the counsel of many different people,
um,
and,

545
00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:50.560
and being clear on what is the role and what are the truths and non truths and

546
00:30:50.561 --> 00:30:54.100
how do they all come together and how then can you articulate it to the

547
00:30:54.101 --> 00:30:55.510
audiences where it makes sense,

548
00:30:55.511 --> 00:30:59.620
whether that's the board of directors or the employee who thinks I'm talking

549
00:30:59.621 --> 00:31:02.920
about smoking joints.
Um,
during office hours is a good idea.

550
00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:09.080
We had a lot of that.
Well,
that's,
uh,

551
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:13.780
that's definitely an interesting note to end on a,
for the formal questions.
Um,

552
00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.240
but I wanted to open it up before we go to the dory,

553
00:31:16.241 --> 00:31:21.130
to anyone in the room who would have a question or we can switch it over.

554
00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:23.470
<v 3>Uh,
one of the questions I have is it,</v>

555
00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:28.490
I really admire the sense of responsibility.
It seems that you have as,

556
00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:33.020
um,
identifying as Lgbtq and,
um,
kind of taking that on.

557
00:31:33.021 --> 00:31:37.460
And I'd be curious to know where in,
you know,

558
00:31:37.461 --> 00:31:39.560
if there was sort of like a moment where you,

559
00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:42.380
you felt that responsibility or if it,
if it,
you know,

560
00:31:42.381 --> 00:31:46.710
maybe it was more acquainted to um,
maturity or where during your,

561
00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:48.380
your life or career that you said,
wow.

562
00:31:48.381 --> 00:31:50.510
Like I really need to make sure that I use my voice.

563
00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:54.680
<v 0>Yeah.
Thank you for the question.
And then I think I would go back to when I,
um,</v>

564
00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:59.040
supported,
um,
that large brokerage firm.
And so anybody knowing,

565
00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:04.260
um,
Wall Street brokerage firms,
they're mainly male and typically 56,

566
00:32:04.261 --> 00:32:06.510
I'm sure that age is higher now.
Um,

567
00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:09.300
and pretty much straight with only very few exceptions.

568
00:32:09.301 --> 00:32:12.030
And so it was in that role that I realized,
you know,

569
00:32:12.031 --> 00:32:16.020
I really need to show up not only as a,
as a female leader,

570
00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:18.510
but also be authentic and at,
you know,

571
00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:22.830
and one of the ways that that was made easy for me that I should name is that

572
00:32:22.831 --> 00:32:27.480
having a kid is an equalizing force to where you can,
um,

573
00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:28.260
you know,

574
00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:32.310
really connect with somebody if they also have kids and just talk about their

575
00:32:32.311 --> 00:32:34.020
children and that situation.

576
00:32:34.021 --> 00:32:36.210
You don't have to name the family structure or anything,

577
00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:39.800
but it just makes a common,
you have some common ground there.

578
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:44.450
That I found was a really important platform that then I could use to kind of

579
00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:48.500
explain the differences between our families.
Um,
when there were differences.

580
00:32:48.501 --> 00:32:48.741
I mean,

581
00:32:48.741 --> 00:32:52.070
now thank goodness there are so many different things where I'm actually married

582
00:32:52.071 --> 00:32:54.230
as opposed to when we weren't.
And you know,

583
00:32:54.231 --> 00:32:56.240
the financial situations my family had,

584
00:32:56.241 --> 00:32:59.600
were very different from the people I would be talking to.
Um,

585
00:32:59.601 --> 00:33:03.920
and sometimes I had a chance to do that kind of education,
you know,
that moment.

586
00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.500
Um,
but it was then when then when I realized,
okay,

587
00:33:06.501 --> 00:33:09.740
I can create a common ground with people who probably had never talked to a

588
00:33:09.741 --> 00:33:12.770
lesbian,
um,
leader before honestly,

589
00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:16.700
or saw them in any way where there was some kind of common ground.
And,

590
00:33:16.701 --> 00:33:18.260
and that's where I kind of,

591
00:33:18.261 --> 00:33:21.760
it's submitted for me that I need to be a leader and show up in the right way

592
00:33:21.761 --> 00:33:24.020
it's been,
and then also I started,
you know,

593
00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:25.460
as you start getting older in your career,

594
00:33:25.461 --> 00:33:27.770
you realize people younger than you are actually watching you.

595
00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:31.250
And so I feel a responsibility around that where it's like,
you know,

596
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:36.430
I need to handle myself in a way that that is something that people would want

597
00:33:36.501 --> 00:33:37.334
to follow.

598
00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:39.480
<v 4>Yeah.
Thank you.</v>

599
00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:45.390
<v 5>Thank you again,
so much for coming and talking today.
Um,</v>

600
00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:49.440
my question for you is how do you think that,
um,

601
00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:52.690
the folks running the LGBT Erg is,

602
00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:56.930
can best engage with more senior folks,
especially given that time is,
um,

603
00:33:57.030 --> 00:34:00.480
frequently difficult to come by as folks get more and more senior in their

604
00:34:00.481 --> 00:34:01.314
career?

605
00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:02.700
<v 0>Yeah,
that's a great question.</v>

606
00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:07.800
And one of the things that really surprised me when I joined Tia last year,

607
00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:10.590
we had a panel,
um,
you know,

608
00:34:10.591 --> 00:34:14.700
LGBT panel and I think it was,
uh,
uh,
it was on coming out day.

609
00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:17.670
It was October 11th last year.
And,
uh,

610
00:34:17.671 --> 00:34:20.910
what really surprised me is as the panel started in,

611
00:34:20.911 --> 00:34:22.650
walked the entire executive committee,

612
00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:26.640
our CEO and all of his direct reports except for maybe two who couldn't make it.

613
00:34:26.910 --> 00:34:30.300
And that was the first time in any of the time I've done this.
And,

614
00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:33.600
and the two decades I've been playing around with this stuff that the entire

615
00:34:33.601 --> 00:34:36.540
executive committee,
uh,
joined in LGBT event.

616
00:34:36.541 --> 00:34:40.050
And that just floored me and it was really impactful.
It made me realize,

617
00:34:40.051 --> 00:34:44.310
you know,
Tia really walks the talk around,
you know,

618
00:34:44.311 --> 00:34:46.590
the importance of all of the Erg is because they do,

619
00:34:46.591 --> 00:34:49.410
they would do that with other employee resource groups.

620
00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:52.860
And so I don't think that is unusual for the company,

621
00:34:52.861 --> 00:34:56.940
but I think that's something where you guys should ask leadership to actually

622
00:34:56.941 --> 00:35:01.010
join and be visible in different events.
Cause because that goes a long way.
Um,

623
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:03.470
in particularly if they might,
certain ones,

624
00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:05.960
certain folks might show up for some events and not others.
It,

625
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.790
it tells a story about who's not present.
Um,

626
00:35:08.791 --> 00:35:12.750
so that would be one thing is making sure that the leadership is present but

627
00:35:12.751 --> 00:35:14.070
finding the right network.

628
00:35:14.071 --> 00:35:17.670
So I'm sure within how many employees do you guys have at Google?

629
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.140
Oh really?
Okay.
I thought it would be a little bit bigger.
Um,

630
00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:24.430
if you think about the entire organization,
you know,

631
00:35:24.431 --> 00:35:29.230
have you guys mapped out where the rising leaders are and really making sure

632
00:35:29.231 --> 00:35:34.100
that they have a voice and are using their voice both for LGBT and otherwise.
Um,

633
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:36.370
that's important.
And with talent review,

634
00:35:36.371 --> 00:35:40.140
I'm sure your company does talent reviews where people go through and say who's

635
00:35:40.141 --> 00:35:44.220
the upcoming talent?
And they always flag whether they are in a diverse group.

636
00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:46.890
You've got to advocate to have a rainbow on there.

637
00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:48.690
And so I'm doing that now at our company.

638
00:35:48.691 --> 00:35:52.020
It's complicated because there's legal issues around it.
But you know,

639
00:35:52.021 --> 00:35:55.440
if you just are showing of somebodies a female and whether they're a person of

640
00:35:55.441 --> 00:35:56.670
color,
that's great.

641
00:35:56.790 --> 00:36:00.000
But we also need to have the LGBT thing there because that's one of the reasons

642
00:36:00.001 --> 00:36:00.834
people don't come out.

643
00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:04.260
They don't see it as an advantage as they're moving up in their career.

644
00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:09.350
So advocating as an Erg to have talent reviews include people who are openly,

645
00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:12.660
uh,
willing to share that.
Because to me,
you know,

646
00:36:12.661 --> 00:36:16.740
I hired a friend of mine who's an African American gay man.
I'm like,

647
00:36:16.741 --> 00:36:21.040
that's a twofer.
We need to get a double bonus points for that.
Um,

648
00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:22.020
and so anyway,

649
00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:25.980
advocating for that at the company is important because every diverse group that

650
00:36:25.981 --> 00:36:27.480
somebody has within them,

651
00:36:27.481 --> 00:36:31.980
that every additional one is more experience around things that all of us need

652
00:36:31.981 --> 00:36:34.410
to learn from.
So those are,
those are some of the thoughts I have.

653
00:36:34.411 --> 00:36:37.760
But engaging your senior leadership to attend events is a very,
um,

654
00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:40.830
outward display of support that I would recommend.

655
00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.810
And the vein of the question that you just answered.
Um,

656
00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:50.930
how do you think that your own rise over the years have effected your ability to

657
00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:58.370
do what you just said,
advocate,
um,
whatnot?
You know?
Um,
I,

658
00:36:58.410 --> 00:37:03.090
I find that I've been very lucky in my career as I've moved up,

659
00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:05.400
but honestly I think a lot of it is a lot of hard work.

660
00:37:05.401 --> 00:37:08.070
Just like all of you have experienced that,
um,

661
00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:11.550
you have to do a ton of hard work and a ton of caring for people and then doors

662
00:37:11.551 --> 00:37:16.350
are open for you.
Um,
um,
but you know,
having a voice on Lgbt,

663
00:37:16.351 --> 00:37:16.831
I'll tell you,

664
00:37:16.831 --> 00:37:20.580
I've had many situations where I've come really close to not saying anything.

665
00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:23.550
Being the person in the room saying,
excuse me.
You know,

666
00:37:23.551 --> 00:37:26.880
you just use language that really isn't appropriate and can be offensive to

667
00:37:26.881 --> 00:37:31.540
people.
Um,
you know,
that's important.
But what one thing I would tell you is,

668
00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:36.000
it was about midway through my career that I realized I have less a voice on

669
00:37:36.001 --> 00:37:41.001
Lgbtq matters than I do watching out for my people of color because I'm not a

670
00:37:41.191 --> 00:37:44.940
person of color.
I have more of a voice going after something.

671
00:37:44.941 --> 00:37:48.360
If I see an issue around that because I have no nothing to gain in it.

672
00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:52.320
Whereas some people will see all that's just the angry lesbian or the angry gay

673
00:37:52.321 --> 00:37:53.790
man fussing about something.

674
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.080
So that's why I kind of point out how do we help other Erg is how can we give

675
00:37:58.081 --> 00:38:01.590
voice to people who don't have voices.
And I think that's where power comes in.

676
00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:06.120
So I try to go beyond being an LGBT leader to being,

677
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:09.300
I'm a leader trying to help diversity at the company and inclusion,

678
00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:12.330
which is super critical because when you get to the point of inclusion,

679
00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:14.970
it goes to a lot of things that a lot of companies don't talk about.

680
00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:19.530
It gets to help people look,
it gets to their social class and social status.
Uh,

681
00:38:19.531 --> 00:38:21.660
it gets to wait.
It gets to,
you know,

682
00:38:21.661 --> 00:38:24.780
let's start naming things that cause people to be in the outgroup.

683
00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:28.230
That's that area of inclusion is something that,
you know,

684
00:38:28.231 --> 00:38:32.760
all of us who understand or have ever been on the receiving end of being

685
00:38:32.761 --> 00:38:33.870
excluded for something,

686
00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:37.660
we all have to be a voice to make sure everyone is included in things because

687
00:38:37.661 --> 00:38:41.470
that's how companies do a better job.
Teams do a better job.
So,
you know,

688
00:38:41.471 --> 00:38:43.570
I'd say yes,
I've had a voice with LGBT,

689
00:38:43.571 --> 00:38:47.920
but I've seen more power helping other groups that I'm not a member of every
day.

690
00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:53.450
<v 5>But you do have what you have over the years.
Like more,
more recently.</v>

691
00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:58.990
Do you feel like you are more or less able to do that because of the roles that

692
00:38:59.000 --> 00:38:59.930
you take now?

693
00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:03.990
<v 0>More able.
Yeah.
I mean the more resources you have,
the more budget you have.</v>

694
00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:09.030
It's really great.
Like,
so yeah,
I can write a time.
It's not an issue.
Uh,

695
00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:14.460
well I mean we make time for whatever's important.
Right?
Yeah.
Okay,

696
00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:15.740
good.
Yeah,

697
00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:23.860
no what I mean,
uh,
time management.
It's funny.
Um,

698
00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:28.860
we can get as much done as,
as we prioritize.
Yeah.
Hi.

699
00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:34.920
<v 3>So I guess there's something to be said for if somebody is in one of the</v>

700
00:39:36.551 --> 00:39:40.250
companies that you work at that's in an Erg at,

701
00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:43.390
at Google or Tia or wherever,

702
00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:47.920
then it's almost that that person is,

703
00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:50.440
is I guess already in,

704
00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:55.780
in a position of more privilege than someone else because they do have a seat at

705
00:39:55.781 --> 00:39:58.750
the table.
So how do you advocate for those people,

706
00:39:58.751 --> 00:40:03.751
whether they're in the queer community or people of color or really any of these

707
00:40:04.571 --> 00:40:09.430
intersectional groups who don't have that seat at the table?

708
00:40:09.431 --> 00:40:14.431
When we look out at our Erg is they're not there because for various reasons and

709
00:40:15.881 --> 00:40:16.720
our society,

710
00:40:16.721 --> 00:40:21.130
they haven't been afforded that opportunity to even to even be here,

711
00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:25.300
not having the access to the social capital,

712
00:40:25.301 --> 00:40:27.610
the educational capital to even get,

713
00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:30.700
get somewhere like here to have that voice.

714
00:40:30.701 --> 00:40:34.390
How do you advocate for this people that are basically outside of the system?

715
00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:37.210
<v 0>That's a great question.
I don't know if I have an answer for that one.</v>

716
00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:41.290
I would love to.
Can you help me figure it out?
I'll try it.

717
00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:46.200
That'd be awesome.
Yeah,
but no,
I,
I agree with you there,
there,
um,

718
00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:49.150
as our society has spread from the haves and have nots,

719
00:40:49.151 --> 00:40:51.550
it's even more of an issue where,
um,

720
00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:55.420
being able to figure out how to get people out of situations where they feel

721
00:40:55.421 --> 00:40:59.730
completely,
um,
without any power to change anything is,

722
00:40:59.731 --> 00:41:03.960
is very hard.
So thank you for the question.
But I,
yeah,

723
00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:06.030
that would answer.

724
00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:09.780
<v 3>I appreciate the honest answer cause I don't,
I don't know if anyone does have,</v>

725
00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:12.240
have the answer.
I guess we have to work on that.

726
00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:14.710
<v 0>Yeah.
That's what we're thinking of the next generation is going to do.</v>

727
00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:15.983
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

728
00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:20.830
<v 0>Because the next generation is always smarter than the last one.
Yes sir.</v>

729
00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:25.400
<v 5>I have one more question.
Um,
so I feel like just hearing you speak,
you know,</v>

730
00:41:25.401 --> 00:41:29.430
you'll have this like amazing confidence about your identity and,
um,

731
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:34.510
sort of your role and you talked about sort of what made you out,

732
00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:39.270
like come out in the workplace.
But I guess my question is more how have you,

733
00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:43.370
have you or have you always had that confidence or has it developed over time?

734
00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:45.200
Um,
especially,

735
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:49.510
I guess along with how General Perceptions of,
uh,

736
00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:52.060
LGBT Q people have changed.

737
00:41:53.050 --> 00:41:54.530
<v 0>Yeah,
that's a good question.
I mean,</v>

738
00:41:54.570 --> 00:41:59.170
I think I've always enjoyed being a leader and I've had some level of
confidence,

739
00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:03.250
um,
but not,
not with myself personally.
Um,

740
00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:04.930
it probably,
you know,

741
00:42:04.931 --> 00:42:09.850
I was probably 26 before I really was comfortable with myself.
And it's,

742
00:42:09.851 --> 00:42:13.690
um,
I think that whole process of coming out and talking to people and saying,

743
00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:18.190
being honest with people,
because for so long I wasn't fully honest with people.

744
00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:21.220
And,
um,
you know,
just a funny story.
Um,

745
00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:23.350
when I was pregnant and I'd walk into rooms,

746
00:42:23.351 --> 00:42:25.240
I had this job where I had to meet with all kinds of people.

747
00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:28.480
And when you're obviously pregnant,
it's just the same question every time.

748
00:42:28.481 --> 00:42:30.910
It's like,
oh,
Renee,
you're pregnant.
Congratulations.

749
00:42:30.911 --> 00:42:33.640
I didn't know you were married.
And I'd say,
well,
I'm not married.

750
00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:36.190
And they would be like,
okay,
what do I say now?

751
00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:39.200
<v 2>Oh,
she was just a,
yeah.</v>

752
00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:42.880
<v 0>Um,
and then I would just start talking and,
you know,
and,
and,</v>

753
00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:45.430
and helping them understand the whole,
the whole story.

754
00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:47.860
But I had to do that over and over and over and over again.

755
00:42:47.890 --> 00:42:49.450
And if I didn't have to do that,

756
00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:52.990
I don't think I would've gotten as comfortable as quickly because it was like it

757
00:42:52.991 --> 00:42:56.860
was awkward and all of that stuff.
And then,
you know,

758
00:42:56.920 --> 00:43:01.330
it gave me a platform.
And so anyway,
it was almost like,
uh,
you know,

759
00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:04.090
not being a straight person is not a good thing.

760
00:43:04.091 --> 00:43:06.850
It's not something you'd put on your resume or that your parents are proud of.

761
00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:11.440
And so,
you know,
it takes a lot of years before you're like,
okay,
this is me.

762
00:43:11.441 --> 00:43:15.340
It's who I am.
I'm doing cool stuff.
Um,
you know,

763
00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:16.450
and I'm good with myself.

764
00:43:16.451 --> 00:43:18.960
So I think it takes actually being comfortable with yourself and,

765
00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:21.040
and getting through all that,
you know,

766
00:43:21.550 --> 00:43:24.650
and some people never are or,

767
00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:27.190
or people around them don't let them be comfortable with themselves.

768
00:43:28.570 --> 00:43:29.130
But thank you for that

769
00:43:29.130 --> 00:43:32.580
<v 2>question.
Great.
I Dunno,</v>

770
00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:36.630
I dunno if we had any other questions in the room or questions from the dory

771
00:43:36.631 --> 00:43:40.830
that maybe we,
um,
we didn't cover off yet,
but the Dory

772
00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:45.060
I can ask what's the story?
Yeah,
that'd be great.

773
00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:50.930
<v 5>So,
uh,
this too,</v>

774
00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:53.420
I think the two that we didn't really touch on because I already touched on like

775
00:43:53.421 --> 00:43:57.560
what you would say to start younger in your career,
it's more,

776
00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:01.220
and I think you have broached this a little bit,
but,
um,

777
00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:05.080
for sort of the next generation of folks,
um,

778
00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:09.080
who are identify as queer,
um,
what are,

779
00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:12.050
which issues do you see as high as parity in the workplace?

780
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:17.830
<v 0>Education is probably the top one because there's so much confusion around what,</v>

781
00:44:17.831 --> 00:44:20.990
what does that mean?
If somebody says,
I'd like to be,
uh,
you know,

782
00:44:20.991 --> 00:44:24.470
referred to as they,
you know,
for somebody who's a baby and I'm like,

783
00:44:24.471 --> 00:44:27.590
what in the hell are you doing?
What's going on with the whole Pronoun thing?

784
00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:32.460
And how do we educate in a way that,
that helps people not feel like this is,

785
00:44:32.490 --> 00:44:35.070
um,
some sort of change that isn't needed.

786
00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:38.910
And so I think that that dialogue across a very different perspective is

787
00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:42.660
important for the next generation.
I mean,
how do you explain,
um,

788
00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:46.570
a lot of the continuums people are on related to gender,
um,

789
00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:49.800
and explain it in a way that doesn't completely freak people out to where they

790
00:44:49.801 --> 00:44:51.270
shut down.
Um,

791
00:44:51.350 --> 00:44:54.930
and I think that's the biggest challenge in this space because it is changed to

792
00:44:54.931 --> 00:44:57.030
some fundamental pieces that the,

793
00:44:57.210 --> 00:45:01.560
particularly the boomer and older generations have held as capital t truth.

794
00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:06.150
And,
you know,
our next generation is questioning all of that capital t truth.

795
00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:11.340
Um,
and I like that.
I think it's,
I think it's awesome.
So I would just try to say,

796
00:45:11.341 --> 00:45:11.790
how do you,

797
00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:14.790
how do we educate in a way that's meaningful and actually have some friends

798
00:45:14.791 --> 00:45:18.450
working on a concept that could really help with that?
Um,

799
00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:22.980
and it's called identity diversity and it helps understand all the elements of,

800
00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:26.160
um,
gender,
sexual orientation expression.

801
00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:28.890
Because all of those things can be confusing if you,

802
00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:30.660
if you don't know how to think about them.

803
00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:35.100
And so I'm working with them to kind of get that out into different workplaces

804
00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:38.670
to help explain and kind of get into,
um,

805
00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:43.060
gender fluidity isn't something to be scared of.
Um,
and,

806
00:45:43.070 --> 00:45:46.830
and all of that.
So,
but we need to figure out how to educate would be my answer.

807
00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:50.640
<v 6>It's Kinda tall.
I,
I'm wondering,</v>

808
00:45:50.641 --> 00:45:53.970
it's a lot of responsibility like you said,
to educate people,

809
00:45:53.971 --> 00:45:57.150
to take moments and think about what's a teachable moment,

810
00:45:57.151 --> 00:45:59.700
what's inappropriate moment when you hold back?

811
00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:02.850
What's a question that you wish people would ask you more often that

812
00:46:04.450 --> 00:46:07.170
enable you a platform that you could speak about?

813
00:46:07.171 --> 00:46:11.100
Something that people are uncomfortable to ask you either professionally or

814
00:46:11.101 --> 00:46:13.350
related to LBG.
Tq.

815
00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:15.950
<v 0>Yeah.
You know,
uh,
um,
I think,
um,</v>

816
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.540
differences in family is one of the ones that I find interesting because we

817
00:46:19.541 --> 00:46:23.890
didn't know starting a family what might be different and,
and come to find out,

818
00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:28.510
you know,
it's really not,
um,
you know,
cause when you have a,
a teething baby,

819
00:46:28.511 --> 00:46:31.680
somebody in here has a teething baby.
I remember talking us.
Um,

820
00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:35.050
doesn't matter if you're straight,
gay,
be any anywhere on the continuum.

821
00:46:35.051 --> 00:46:36.250
It's still a teething baby.

822
00:46:36.251 --> 00:46:40.720
And to be able to have people that you can come together with an and ask help

823
00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:44.410
for.
So that whole family pieces is one.
Um,

824
00:46:44.411 --> 00:46:48.100
but I've had some people ask some pretty crazy questions and so there's always

825
00:46:48.101 --> 00:46:50.890
interest in,
you know,
uh,
you know,
conception.

826
00:46:50.891 --> 00:46:54.640
It's like you wouldn't ask that of anybody else.
And so they're also,
you know,

827
00:46:54.641 --> 00:46:58.150
so there's a,
there's an to some extremes people go to around,
um,

828
00:46:58.210 --> 00:47:00.220
around different things.
So,
um,

829
00:47:00.221 --> 00:47:03.460
I don't know if there's ever been a question people aren't asking enough about,

830
00:47:03.730 --> 00:47:06.280
um,
but yeah.
Yeah.

831
00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:10.510
But the whole family piece is probably important and definition of families have

832
00:47:10.511 --> 00:47:14.210
changed so substantially in our society where,
you know,
um,

833
00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:17.830
having an LGBT family,
that was our experience in the childbirth.

834
00:47:18.010 --> 00:47:20.230
We kind of thought people might be weird at the hospital.

835
00:47:20.231 --> 00:47:24.640
And this was back in 2003.
Um,
and it's like,
it was quite the opposite.

836
00:47:24.641 --> 00:47:26.440
All the nurses were like,
we were just so happy.

837
00:47:26.441 --> 00:47:28.960
More than one parent is here because they,

838
00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:32.290
a lot of people coming in who are single parents going into a situation,

839
00:47:32.291 --> 00:47:34.270
it's going to be really tough.
And so they're like,

840
00:47:34.271 --> 00:47:36.430
we don't care what the makeup of the family is,

841
00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:40.630
as long as there's more people to help the child,
which I found fascinating.

842
00:47:40.631 --> 00:47:42.580
It was real interesting learning for me there.

843
00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:44.773
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

844
00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:52.270
<v 0>Yeah.
And I'm also raising a,
a straight ally,
so I hope I do a good job with that.</v>

845
