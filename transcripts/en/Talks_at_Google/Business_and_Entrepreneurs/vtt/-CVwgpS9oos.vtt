1
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.720
Mark and I started researching legacy,
um,
back in 2012.

2
00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:11.643
Um,

3
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.540
and part of the reason we did is that we saw a lot of brands and headlines like

4
00:00:16.541 --> 00:00:18.380
you do see today,
um,

5
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.930
that were going out of business brands that have been around for a long time.
Um,

6
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.550
just this past few months we've seen toys,
a rust,
Gibson Guitars,

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.640
um,
today orchard supply hardware.

8
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.560
Blockbuster actually had a couple stores in Alaska still open that nobody knew

9
00:00:35.561 --> 00:00:38.410
about but just closed.
And the question arose,

10
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.910
what is it about the current context,
the current market that's,
um,

11
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.210
that,
that these long standing brands that we thought would always be around,

12
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.310
are no longer here.
Um,

13
00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.080
and we looked closer at culture and so that we live in a very short term world

14
00:00:53.081 --> 00:00:55.510
right now.
People are looking for instant gratification.

15
00:00:55.511 --> 00:00:57.980
They're looking for an overnight success.
Um,

16
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.030
we celebrate it in the media and when we looked at the brands that we're

17
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.460
actually building modern legacies,
we saw a different behaviors.

18
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.860
So that was actually the inspiration for this book.
Um,

19
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.510
will we going back and forth tonight tire today,
talking a bit about this,

20
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.980
the stories in the book and uh,

21
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.270
we'll leave some time at the end for questions about,
uh,

22
00:01:19.271 --> 00:01:21.670
about the material as well.
But,
um,
I'll,

23
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.120
I'll turn it over to mark just to share some of the original inspiration for the

24
00:01:25.121 --> 00:01:26.710
legacy lab,
which is where this all started.

25
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.020
<v 2>Hi,
I'm mark.
I'm a very Canadian.
Uh,</v>

26
00:01:31.021 --> 00:01:35.040
my parents sent me here from Toronto and said,
I'm a,

27
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.910
you're a failed musician.
Um,
you seem to be filling it advertising.

28
00:01:38.911 --> 00:01:41.310
Maybe you could write a book and make the family proud of you.

29
00:01:41.311 --> 00:01:45.090
So the inspiration for this cause my parents kicked my ass to write a book.

30
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.300
Um,
in addition,
uh,

31
00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.600
it has to be working on some business problems for two very iconic brands.

32
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.340
The Lexus and the Ritz Carlton and one was coming up on being 25 years old and

33
00:01:56.341 --> 00:01:58.530
one was coming up on being 30 years old.

34
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.340
And they had a fundamentally different point of view on how they looked at their

35
00:02:02.341 --> 00:02:06.780
age,
um,
their success,
where they've been,
where they were,
where they were going.

36
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.000
In the case of the Automotive Company,

37
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.800
they felt that 25 years it was too young to celebrate,
uh,
all their success.

38
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.860
They felt that if they said,
look how far we've come and only 25 years,

39
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.190
the brands like BMW and Mercedes would say when you get to be 80,

40
00:02:20.191 --> 00:02:23.310
90 to a hundred years old,
that's the moment when you should celebrate.

41
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.510
But if you really want to remark upon 25 years,
um,

42
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.900
we'll just pat you on the back and say,
look how far you still have to go.

43
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.620
And the iconic hotel company,
so things in exactly the opposite way,

44
00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:36.000
which was the age of 30.

45
00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:40.380
They felt that a 30 year old Ritz Carlton was too old to celebrate that it was

46
00:02:40.381 --> 00:02:42.810
far better to be the cosmopolitan,

47
00:02:42.811 --> 00:02:45.600
which was brand new than the 30 year old Ritz Carlton.

48
00:02:45.601 --> 00:02:49.190
And I found that fascinating because so many,
um,
uh,

49
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.160
startup companies and entrepreneurs would come into our organization and say,

50
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.670
how do you succeed like Lexus and Ritz Carlton in 25 and 30 years?

51
00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.130
And yet these brands did not know how to make sense their own success.

52
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.820
Concurrently.
I work at an agency called team one.

53
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.500
We work on Lexus and Ritz Carlton.

54
00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:09.070
And we were going through our own sort of identity crisis,
which is a,

55
00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:14.071
we started in 1987 and I'm effectively still a modern agency,

56
00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:19.120
but the world was transforming all around us as you know,
um,
uh,

57
00:03:19.121 --> 00:03:22.150
social media companies were behaving like ad agencies and entertainment

58
00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:25.000
companies were behaving like ad agencies and ad agencies were behaving like

59
00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:25.811
media companies.

60
00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:30.010
And what we used to take for granted as being certain was changing dramatically.

61
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.870
Um,
and then probably most importantly,
uh,
I was about to become a dad,
uh,

62
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:36.070
for the first time in my life,

63
00:03:36.071 --> 00:03:39.160
which was incredibly scary because I could barely take care of myself.

64
00:03:39.161 --> 00:03:43.930
So now I'd be having to take care of another life.
And I was concerned that,

65
00:03:43.931 --> 00:03:47.800
um,
the example I wanted to set for my daughter wasn't just that I've worked very

66
00:03:47.801 --> 00:03:49.900
hard but to no end in specific,

67
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.110
but that I've worked very hard toward an end that was meaningful and important

68
00:03:53.111 --> 00:03:55.340
to me.
And for that reason,

69
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.810
I started looking at leaders of organizations that we're building careers and

70
00:03:58.811 --> 00:04:01.330
building brands that had stories that I had admired,

71
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.400
many of which we cover in the book,

72
00:04:03.401 --> 00:04:06.190
but they weren't the ones who were simply doing things to make the greatest

73
00:04:06.191 --> 00:04:07.024
amount of money,

74
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.970
but the ones doing things to make the greatest amount of contribution.

75
00:04:09.971 --> 00:04:14.470
So those were the ingredients that really inspired me to start researching this

76
00:04:14.471 --> 00:04:17.740
topic.
And then I reached out to friends and colleagues and peers,

77
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.120
including Lucas,

78
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.740
who had a wonderful career as a writer and a researcher with fast company.
And,

79
00:04:23.741 --> 00:04:26.050
uh,
I was hoping he shared a little bit about,
um,

80
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.620
other than I bothered him to do it.
Why he bothered to help.

81
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.530
<v 0>Yeah.
So,
um,</v>

82
00:04:31.531 --> 00:04:36.360
mark had been collaborating for over a decade and I started my career back in

83
00:04:36.361 --> 00:04:40.880
2002 at the Atlantic monthly.
Um,
and that's a magazine that really invests in,

84
00:04:40.881 --> 00:04:43.410
in long stories.
Um,
while I was there,

85
00:04:43.411 --> 00:04:45.810
they actually published the longest story that they've ever published,

86
00:04:45.811 --> 00:04:49.680
which was three cover issues in a row that I'm the one in national magazine word

87
00:04:49.681 --> 00:04:53.190
that you're on the unbuilding of the World Trade Center back.
Um,
2001.

88
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.970
And uh,
so I came out of that space in journalism of,

89
00:04:57.971 --> 00:05:01.310
of really investing in stories,
really telling what,
what uh,

90
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.530
what was behind what the mainstream media or the standard media would tell in a,

91
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.120
in a,
in a journalistic approach to a story to,

92
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.680
to going on to fast company.

93
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.390
Fast company was a publication that was all about telling personal stories in a

94
00:05:15.391 --> 00:05:19.620
business world and really getting into the leaders behind the brands.
Um,

95
00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.610
whereas a fortune or Forbes might talk about the numbers or the products more

96
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.360
fast company was really interested in the culture and the people that built

97
00:05:27.361 --> 00:05:31.730
those brands.
So when mark started describing a project about legacy,
uh,

98
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.640
my ears perked up.
I knew that was something that really resonated with readers.

99
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.290
And when I actually got on the ground working with some of the interviews,

100
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.490
I was hearing things that I rarely ever heard in,
in journalism.
Um,

101
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.010
people would describe for us a variety of stories throughout their life and at

102
00:05:47.011 --> 00:05:49.500
the end of the interview say,
Hey,
can I get a transcript of this?

103
00:05:49.501 --> 00:05:51.930
I've never talked about a lot of this stuff.
Um,

104
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.780
and these were CEOs who've been interviewed countless times throughout their

105
00:05:54.781 --> 00:05:58.640
career.
So I knew that we were asking about something that was very important.
Um,

106
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.250
whether you asked somebody young or old about legacy,

107
00:06:01.251 --> 00:06:02.660
they have some very personal,

108
00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:05.900
meaningful things to share about the way they see their life,

109
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.750
the way they see meaning and significance.
Um,

110
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:13.160
so it was a very rich topic to invest our time in.

111
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.130
Um,
and uh,
well what was,

112
00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.960
what was interesting from there is that it wasn't just our personal interest.

113
00:06:20.961 --> 00:06:21.351
I mean we,

114
00:06:21.351 --> 00:06:26.351
we started to see that there were leaders who also wanted to share that share

115
00:06:26.571 --> 00:06:28.310
that,
um,
the story of their legacy.

116
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:33.610
<v 2>So what we thought we would do over the course of the next,
um,
15,</v>

117
00:06:33.611 --> 00:06:37.360
20 ish minutes is walk you through some of the key principles that we've learned

118
00:06:37.361 --> 00:06:41.440
from the leaders that we spoke to.
Uh,
we'll topline the five key chapters,

119
00:06:41.441 --> 00:06:42.490
the five key principles,

120
00:06:42.491 --> 00:06:45.760
and tell you some iconic stories that we'd love to share.
Certainly at the end,

121
00:06:45.761 --> 00:06:48.910
if you have questions,
we'd be happy to take them with they're easy questions.

122
00:06:48.911 --> 00:06:51.550
We'd be even happier if their heart will probably say,
oh,

123
00:06:51.551 --> 00:06:55.150
that's a really good question.
We'll get back to you.
And we may or may not.
Um,

124
00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:59.590
so the first chapter in the book is about taking leadership personally.

125
00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:01.900
And as a bit of an anecdote,

126
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:06.520
I went to a business school and the reason that matters is because I remember

127
00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:11.500
talking to my parents distinctly at one point and said,
I'm thinking that,
um,

128
00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:15.800
for higher education,
I may go to film school,
um,

129
00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:17.350
or I may go to business school.
And they said,
well,

130
00:07:17.351 --> 00:07:19.750
you should do whatever you want as long as you go to business school.

131
00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:21.280
So I did that.

132
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.830
And one of the first lessons they taught a business school is what is the

133
00:07:23.831 --> 00:07:28.150
responsibility of a business today to which the answer was maximize shareholder

134
00:07:28.151 --> 00:07:31.540
revenue.
They never talked about taking leadership personally.
In fact,

135
00:07:31.541 --> 00:07:33.220
they said leadership is organizational.

136
00:07:33.221 --> 00:07:36.730
It's not personal and the only responsibility you have is to maximize

137
00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.650
shareholder return revenue.
Um,

138
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:44.380
and yet the leaders that we spoke to speak beautifully and prolifically about

139
00:07:44.381 --> 00:07:48.550
the things that drive them and seldom if ever did they begin conversations with.

140
00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:52.420
I had an idea that I wanted to make $1 billion and sell my company.

141
00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:55.870
They always began with a problem that they were trying to solve or a quality or

142
00:07:55.871 --> 00:07:58.180
an attribute that they wanted to put into the world.

143
00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:02.230
And the Tribeca Film Festival was a story that I happen to fall in love with.

144
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:03.500
As I said,
I grew up in Toronto.

145
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:07.450
The Toronto Film Festival was a major event and I was always curious to know in

146
00:08:07.451 --> 00:08:11.920
a cluttered,
cloudy field of Sundance and con in Toronto,

147
00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:16.390
how does a modern festival like Tribeca pop up and succeed to which the answer

148
00:08:16.391 --> 00:08:20.680
from the founders of Tribeca Deniro and Rosenthal and Hatkoff was the world

149
00:08:20.681 --> 00:08:22.720
didn't actually need another film festival.

150
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.330
And so if all we were creating was a film festival,

151
00:08:25.331 --> 00:08:28.780
this would have failed and where's the world didn't need another film festival.

152
00:08:28.781 --> 00:08:30.970
The world didn't need the Tribeca film festival.

153
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.160
And I'll share with you the story they shared with me.

154
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:37.270
The three of them grew up in and around New York.
They happen to love film.

155
00:08:37.271 --> 00:08:41.410
They were people of means and people with tremendous influence.
Um,

156
00:08:41.411 --> 00:08:45.190
who at one point toyed with the idea of introducing a film festival into New

157
00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:47.200
York because that was their lifelong passion,

158
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:49.810
but they never really saw a hole in the conventional landscape.

159
00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:53.380
It just didn't make sense.
And then nine 11 happened.

160
00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:58.020
And here you have some people weren't just filmmakers but had a deep care and

161
00:08:58.021 --> 00:09:00.660
consideration for the city that was home.

162
00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:05.190
And they observed from where they sat as people with means and influence that if

163
00:09:05.191 --> 00:09:09.090
people weren't going out and patronizing the businesses that were still around,

164
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:13.980
that not only when New York feel,
um,
devoid of life and vitality,

165
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.900
but as commerce would dwindle,
the city would get worse,
not better over time.

166
00:09:18.901 --> 00:09:21.780
And so they went out to restaurants and they thought,

167
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:25.230
what if we could get more of our friends who also have influence in means to

168
00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:28.410
come out with us?
And they created a program called dinner downtown.

169
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:32.070
This existed before the Tribeca film festival was ever born.

170
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.250
And all they did was they said,
um,
you my friend,

171
00:09:35.251 --> 00:09:38.490
you should come to dinner and you should invite 10 of your friends and let's

172
00:09:38.491 --> 00:09:39.840
keep doing the same thing.

173
00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:43.670
And so they grew an event which they ran on more than one occasion where a

174
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:47.790
hundreds of people,
very influential people,
including Bill Clinton and a queen,

175
00:09:47.791 --> 00:09:51.450
newer would come and patronize the restaurants.
And what they observed was,

176
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.450
if this is what we can do with small application,

177
00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:58.320
could we somehow scale that to impact more of the city of New York?

178
00:09:58.321 --> 00:09:59.880
They actually,
their language was,

179
00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:03.660
they thought about contribution before they ever thought about extraction and

180
00:10:03.661 --> 00:10:06.990
the contribution they want to make was more people in New York coming out,

181
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:11.220
patronizing,
consuming,
um,
adding vitality and culture.

182
00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:15.330
And they simply used film the thing they knew really well as a galvanizing

183
00:10:15.331 --> 00:10:18.540
mechanism to do it.
Um,
they made a lofty promise.

184
00:10:18.541 --> 00:10:22.350
It was close to the end of the year and they basically said four months into

185
00:10:22.351 --> 00:10:25.680
2002,
the Tribeca film festival would be born.

186
00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:28.530
They lead with their hearts.
They lead with their passion.

187
00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:32.850
They led with their ambition.
Um,
but they weren't fully mature thinkers.

188
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.110
They didn't actually think it all the way through in terms of how do we get

189
00:10:37.111 --> 00:10:39.300
money for this thing?
How do we communicate this thing?

190
00:10:39.301 --> 00:10:41.400
How do we make sure that not only are hundreds of friends,
no,

191
00:10:41.401 --> 00:10:44.340
but thousands of people and more from around the world.

192
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.500
And it wasn't until very late in the game,

193
00:10:46.501 --> 00:10:49.770
they were about to call a media conference and canceled their idea or suspended

194
00:10:49.771 --> 00:10:54.150
for a while that they got an unanticipated phone call from American Express that

195
00:10:54.151 --> 00:10:55.950
said,
we'd heard what you guys were doing,

196
00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:59.730
and let us tell you that as citizens of New York and people who were impacted

197
00:10:59.731 --> 00:11:01.680
tragically by the disaster of nine 11,

198
00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:04.920
we have a passion and commitment to revitalizing the city too.

199
00:11:04.921 --> 00:11:06.750
That transcends conventional commerce.

200
00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:09.240
We want to help you make this festival real.

201
00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:12.210
And one of the first questions that American Express asks the founders of

202
00:11:12.211 --> 00:11:13.044
Tribeca is,

203
00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:16.380
but we need to know your three and five year plan to which the answer was,

204
00:11:16.381 --> 00:11:18.890
we don't have a three to five year plan and we don't even know how we're going

205
00:11:18.891 --> 00:11:21.680
to raise $1 million to market this thing.
Um,

206
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:25.500
and so they collaborated and American Express had been their partner for a

207
00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.320
number of years.
They built the program from the ground up.
Today,

208
00:11:28.321 --> 00:11:31.700
it's far more than a film festival.
There are storytellers,

209
00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:35.250
they're storytellers in film.
They're storytellers in literature.

210
00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:38.520
They use high technology to advanced storytelling as well.

211
00:11:38.521 --> 00:11:42.480
They're toying with the idea of taking film out of the name of the festival and

212
00:11:42.481 --> 00:11:46.080
they see Tribeca as being much more of a cultural event and even though the city

213
00:11:46.081 --> 00:11:50.220
to the casual onlooker looks healed in a sense,

214
00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:51.120
um,

215
00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.730
they don't ever imagine a scenario where New York will not need the assistance

216
00:11:54.731 --> 00:11:58.960
and support of a program like Tribeca to bring more attention and community and

217
00:11:58.961 --> 00:12:02.380
interest in the city.
They make a reasonable amount of money.

218
00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:06.100
They have very healthy iconic partners,
automotive partners and so on.

219
00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:08.650
And that put a good amount of capital into the program.

220
00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:12.670
But each year they begin with what positive impact we want to have on the city

221
00:12:12.671 --> 00:12:16.060
of New York.
And as a consequence,
everything falls out of that.

222
00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:18.640
And I loved how we summed it up in the book,

223
00:12:18.641 --> 00:12:21.450
which is to say there are people who take leadership person.

224
00:12:21.451 --> 00:12:23.140
Then there are people who take work personally.

225
00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.750
They don't talk about maximizing shareholder revenue.

226
00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:29.530
They're looking at a higher order return,
which is personal satisfaction,

227
00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:32.860
gratification,
cultural rejuvenation,
and more

228
00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:36.280
<v 0>so from longterm personal ambition,</v>

229
00:12:36.281 --> 00:12:40.180
which is the first chapter to behaving your beliefs,
which is the second chapter.

230
00:12:40.181 --> 00:12:41.440
You have a,
um,

231
00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:46.180
kind of the arc of you can have one person with a longterm personal ambition or

232
00:12:46.181 --> 00:12:50.110
a dream,
but rarely do you see modern legacy builders who do it alone.

233
00:12:50.111 --> 00:12:53.140
We see groups and teams that build around values and beliefs.

234
00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:56.740
So the second chapters focuses on beliefs and values.

235
00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:01.030
And traditionally what you see up in the business world today with a brand

236
00:13:01.031 --> 00:13:04.930
managers or business managers is they're accustomed to saying one thing and

237
00:13:04.931 --> 00:13:08.500
doing another.
Um,
fortunately,
we live in a more,
more and more transparent world.

238
00:13:08.501 --> 00:13:11.770
Consumers are demanding that the brands that they purchased,

239
00:13:11.771 --> 00:13:15.040
the brands they follow actually at,
you know,
have the same values that they do.

240
00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:18.940
Um,
and,
and those are what we would call,
call modern legacy brands.

241
00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:23.650
And one of those is,
um,
the Bluebird cafe.
Um,
Bluebird cafe in Nashville.

242
00:13:23.651 --> 00:13:26.740
It's one of the most famous country music venues in the world.
Um,
uh,

243
00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:31.450
like Tribeca,
it didn't start out.
Um,
uh,
with its modern realization.

244
00:13:31.451 --> 00:13:33.250
It started out as just a,
just a restaurant,

245
00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:38.020
had a lunch service and there was no music.
Um,
and it was 1982 and the founder,

246
00:13:38.021 --> 00:13:41.680
Amy Kurland,
um,
had inherited a small amount of money from our grandmother,

247
00:13:41.681 --> 00:13:44.500
decided to open this cafe.
And as the years went by,
she said,
you know,

248
00:13:44.501 --> 00:13:46.510
I want to educate myself about how to run a business.

249
00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:51.100
And she went to community college and took a variety of courses and the one that

250
00:13:51.101 --> 00:13:52.130
really stuck to,
for her,

251
00:13:52.131 --> 00:13:56.890
it was a marketing course where the instructed her do one thing really well.
And,

252
00:13:56.910 --> 00:14:00.880
uh,
what she realized about her cafe is that she,

253
00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:05.640
she let her boyfriend play at the,
at the cafe once he was in a band,
um,

254
00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:08.500
they'd set up a small stage and she realized that people were really gravitating

255
00:14:08.501 --> 00:14:12.730
towards the music.
So over time the lunch service was dropped.

256
00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:14.770
They doubled the evening,
uh,

257
00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:19.090
performances so that they'd have a performance for new new musicians as well as

258
00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.270
musicians who were established.
And it really took off.

259
00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:27.040
And she had to stick to that as the brand grew because she only had a hundred

260
00:14:27.041 --> 00:14:27.871
seats in this place.

261
00:14:27.871 --> 00:14:31.780
She could have taken it somewhere else into a bigger location and really

262
00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:33.910
essentially sold out and made a lot more money with this.

263
00:14:33.911 --> 00:14:37.330
But it would have destroyed this vision of this brand to she had where she had

264
00:14:37.331 --> 00:14:41.680
created a listening space for artists who walked in off the street.
Um,

265
00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:44.920
Garth Brooks got off a bus and actually got his first,
uh,

266
00:14:44.921 --> 00:14:48.820
album signed at the Bluebird cafe.
Taylor swift launched her career.

267
00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:51.390
Those are the kind of artists that come back,
even the,

268
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:54.890
with their fame and have these tiny performances in front of a hundred people at

269
00:14:54.891 --> 00:14:57.470
this place.
So she,
over the years,

270
00:14:57.471 --> 00:15:02.100
was able to maintain the sanctity basically of,
of this listing space.
Um,

271
00:15:02.101 --> 00:15:05.750
and it's telling the motto of the Bluebird Cafe is sh like,

272
00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:10.390
they basically create this space where they don't want people to speak while the

273
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:14.570
performers are performing.
Um,
so they'll have,
you know,
bachelor,

274
00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.210
Bachelorette parties will call and say,
can we,
can we book a bunch of seats?

275
00:15:17.211 --> 00:15:20.120
And they'll say,
yeah,
but you,
you can't talk.
You're allowed to come,

276
00:15:20.121 --> 00:15:22.280
but you're not allowed to make any noise.
Um,

277
00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:25.130
so they hold very true to this value.
Um,

278
00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:29.300
and to the degree that when Amy Kurland look to retire in the past few years,

279
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.260
she decided rather than sell the brand for the most possible amount of money,

280
00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:36.140
she would donate it to the Nashville songwriters association.

281
00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:40.520
So she called up a former employee of the bluebird,
worked there and said,
hey,

282
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:40.821
listen,

283
00:15:40.821 --> 00:15:43.670
I know that whoever takes this over it won't be able to protect it like you guys

284
00:15:43.671 --> 00:15:43.940
could.

285
00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:47.060
What if I just donate it to you and you continue it in the tradition that I set

286
00:15:47.061 --> 00:15:51.620
up?
And they said,
we'll pay you a fair price for it.
And took it,
took it over.

287
00:15:51.621 --> 00:15:52.401
And in fact,

288
00:15:52.401 --> 00:15:56.060
I've even carried its fame forward while maintaining the culture that she built.

289
00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:59.480
Um,
there was a show called Nashville that you may have heard of.

290
00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:02.140
The bluebird is us essentially a character in that show.
Uh,

291
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:05.270
whenever they're looking to bring the drama down,
um,
they,

292
00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.860
they have a performance in the bluebird.
Um,

293
00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:12.320
and the bluebird now has performances.
I'm in London on a pretty regular basis.

294
00:16:12.321 --> 00:16:14.150
They have performances in Sundance every year.

295
00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:16.870
So the brand has grown organically.
Uh,

296
00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:19.780
but it has stayed true to that core value that,
you know,

297
00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:24.820
that belief in protecting this space where musicians can perform and be heard.

298
00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:29.420
Not only famous musicians,
but people who are trying to start their careers.
Um,

299
00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:30.021
so that,

300
00:16:30.021 --> 00:16:33.530
that is the end of the second circle or second chapter of the book that builds

301
00:16:33.531 --> 00:16:36.350
out from the longterm personal ambition.
You want to talk about the third?

302
00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:36.671
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

303
00:16:36.671 --> 00:16:40.000
So we begin with taking leadership personally and we move into this notion of

304
00:16:40.001 --> 00:16:41.590
behaving your beliefs.
Uh,

305
00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:45.400
the next section of the book gets into this idea of letting outsiders in and the

306
00:16:45.401 --> 00:16:49.540
iconic story we'd like to share as a brand and a platform you may have heard of

307
00:16:49.541 --> 00:16:52.720
called it gets better,
which was developed by Dan Savage.

308
00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:56.710
And what's amazing about it is,
um,
by conventional standards,

309
00:16:56.711 --> 00:17:01.000
it should never have worked because they never designed a program which was,

310
00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:04.240
here's the inner workings.
These are consumers.

311
00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:07.900
And here's what we control and here's what they take because we've packaged it

312
00:17:07.901 --> 00:17:09.850
that way from the get go.

313
00:17:09.851 --> 00:17:13.360
Their intention was to create an idea and unleash it upon the world.

314
00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:17.260
And their language was to become very uncomfortable with the idea or rather to

315
00:17:17.261 --> 00:17:20.900
become very comfortable with the idea of being uncomfortable.
Um,

316
00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:23.380
they didn't care that people were going to take their idea to mess with it.

317
00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:27.760
In fact,
that was their design.
So the famous story goes like this,

318
00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:29.560
and in around 2010,

319
00:17:29.561 --> 00:17:33.520
a young man named Billy Lucas was bullied at school for being different,

320
00:17:33.521 --> 00:17:35.680
that the other kids perceived him to be queer.

321
00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:38.650
And they bullied him to the point that he killed himself.

322
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:42.310
And not only was that a sort of horrific outcome and story,

323
00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:46.540
but the same kids that bullied him went onto his Facebook page after he died and

324
00:17:46.541 --> 00:17:50.010
continued to effectively bully him and assault him in of his family.

325
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.510
And that enraged.

326
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:55.470
I'm a journalist by the name of Dan savage that had a popular column called

327
00:17:55.471 --> 00:17:58.710
savage love and he wrote an enraged post,
which is,

328
00:17:58.711 --> 00:18:03.060
it's horrible that these young kids would make another boy or any young person

329
00:18:03.061 --> 00:18:07.320
feel so badly for being different that they would want to kill themselves.

330
00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.530
And a reader of the story wrote back and said,

331
00:18:10.531 --> 00:18:14.520
I wish I knew Billy Lucas because I would have told you that it gets better.

332
00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:18.270
That effectively as life moves on and you have the benefit of perspective and as

333
00:18:18.271 --> 00:18:21.480
you get a,
an older sort of wiser point of view,

334
00:18:21.481 --> 00:18:23.520
you'll realize that these are silly,
foolish kids.

335
00:18:23.521 --> 00:18:25.500
I shouldn't have had this kind of impact on you.

336
00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:29.940
And that language stuck with Dan and him and his partner,
Terry Miller,
um,

337
00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:33.330
created a video.
And so they did something that was very modern at the time.

338
00:18:33.331 --> 00:18:37.830
They use social tools that other programs and platforms we're ignoring to say,

339
00:18:37.831 --> 00:18:39.090
we don't need to be censored.

340
00:18:39.091 --> 00:18:42.290
We can just put out in the world what we think and their ideas.

341
00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:43.620
They would record a video.

342
00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:47.400
I'm suggesting what life would look like from the point of view of an adult with

343
00:18:47.401 --> 00:18:48.234
wisdom.

344
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:51.990
And they were hoping that maybe they'd get 10 other videos or a hundred other

345
00:18:51.991 --> 00:18:56.040
videos.
And what of course transpired is a thousand video responses in a week,

346
00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:59.110
more than 60,000 video responses,
uh,

347
00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:02.220
currently more than 60 million views of those videos currently.

348
00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.440
And some pretty influential people have taken control,
um,

349
00:19:05.441 --> 00:19:10.260
from Obama to lady Gaga to popular culture and programming.

350
00:19:10.261 --> 00:19:13.050
Like the office did a piece on it gets better as well.

351
00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:17.640
And Dan had talked about how even other advocate groups had a real problem with

352
00:19:17.641 --> 00:19:21.390
the fact that these guys were using social media to tell their story and reach

353
00:19:21.391 --> 00:19:23.610
young kids.
And his point was,
um,

354
00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.820
I embraced the ideals and the values of creating change,

355
00:19:26.821 --> 00:19:30.240
but if modern technology and tools have evolved to allow me to reach more,

356
00:19:30.241 --> 00:19:33.910
why would I not use them?
That's just,
those are rules,
but they're bad rules.

357
00:19:33.911 --> 00:19:35.070
So let's change them.

358
00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:38.880
He also talks passionately about what he calls making a doable difference in his

359
00:19:38.881 --> 00:19:40.980
belief is,
and the world of advocacy.

360
00:19:40.981 --> 00:19:45.060
Too many brands as consumers to do things that sounded like the impossible.

361
00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:50.100
If only we could raise $1 billion if only we could collect this amount of blood.

362
00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:54.270
If only we could take this amount of guns away and people feel powerless in that

363
00:19:54.271 --> 00:19:55.110
conversation.

364
00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:59.910
And his point was to unleash ideas and tools that made people feel that they

365
00:19:59.911 --> 00:20:02.160
could participate and that they could have a hand.

366
00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:06.180
His language was give people the opportunity to make a doable difference and as

367
00:20:06.181 --> 00:20:09.980
a consequence it get,
it gets better.
It continues to grow.
We,

368
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:13.680
we talked to him about the notion of do you ever imagine a world where we won't

369
00:20:13.681 --> 00:20:17.130
need an,
it gets better?
And he said,
no,
the form may change,

370
00:20:17.131 --> 00:20:20.820
but the notion of hate seems like it will persist if we're always going to need

371
00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:24.960
tools and the benefit of wisdom from adults who can say this is how you deal and

372
00:20:24.961 --> 00:20:29.961
cope and his point of view on calling it gets better or brand is he's against

373
00:20:30.151 --> 00:20:33.780
it.
He doesn't think the old confines and rules of branding and organizations are

374
00:20:33.781 --> 00:20:37.800
what helps us succeed.
He thinks you need to set it free in the world.

375
00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.220
So if chapter one was about taking leadership personally in chapter two is

376
00:20:41.221 --> 00:20:42.330
around behaving your beliefs.

377
00:20:42.331 --> 00:20:45.330
The third chapter is really about unleashing ideas in the world,

378
00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.830
enrolling consumers as owners ideas.

379
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.950
<v 0>And effectively I think the language we use is letting outsiders in.</v>

380
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:57.670
So from that we branched into chapter four,
which talks about unconventionality,

381
00:20:57.750 --> 00:21:01.540
um,
staying different.
Um,
the story that we want to share with you guys today,

382
00:21:01.541 --> 00:21:05.420
it's about the Belmont stakes.
This is a brand that's 150 years old.
Um,

383
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:09.040
we've kind of like the original must see event in America.

384
00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:11.830
It's the third race in the triple crown.
So it gets a lot of attention,

385
00:21:11.831 --> 00:21:16.270
especially when there's a triple crown race up for grabs.
And well,
the,

386
00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:19.930
one of the issues that the Belmont stakes and all of horse racing is facing is

387
00:21:19.931 --> 00:21:22.830
the Porsche racing is kind of lost a generation of fans.
Um,

388
00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:25.900
it's not nearly as popular as the NBA or the NFL.

389
00:21:25.901 --> 00:21:29.310
There are a lot of sports that have drawn people away,
um,
for,

390
00:21:29.311 --> 00:21:32.200
for a variety of different reasons.
So Chris k,

391
00:21:32.201 --> 00:21:34.570
the re founder of the Belmont stakes,

392
00:21:34.571 --> 00:21:38.200
which is a term we use for people who have come to takeover brands.
Um,
uh,

393
00:21:38.201 --> 00:21:40.510
after they'd been around for awhile,
um,

394
00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:44.710
had his hands full when he came onboard in 2014 looking at what can we do to get

395
00:21:44.711 --> 00:21:48.880
people either to stick with the sport or to come back into this sport.
Um,

396
00:21:48.881 --> 00:21:52.360
so we start the story in the book.
In 2014 with the racing of the,

397
00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:56.110
the 2014 triple crown,
California chrome was up for grabs,
uh,

398
00:21:56.111 --> 00:21:58.510
up for the triple crown,
didn't actually win.

399
00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:03.990
And so the disappointment was magnified by the fact that 110,000 people were at

400
00:22:04.721 --> 00:22:06.760
this event and couldn't basically get out.

401
00:22:06.761 --> 00:22:10.940
The train stations were not set up for that kind of crowd.
Um,
the,

402
00:22:10.941 --> 00:22:13.330
the roads were completely packed.
Um,

403
00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:17.530
and Chris was in his first year running this event said something has to change.

404
00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:22.300
So the following day,
um,
he did what a traditional brand manager would not do.

405
00:22:22.301 --> 00:22:26.320
I think a traditional brand manager would look for ways to cut money out of the

406
00:22:26.321 --> 00:22:29.290
system and sell tickets,
sell as many tickets as possible,

407
00:22:29.291 --> 00:22:32.770
so maybe we can invest in,
you know,
more seating.
Um,

408
00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:36.340
he decided we're going to sell fewer tickets next year and we're going to invest

409
00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:40.300
in,
in making this a better experience for the people who come both who see it on

410
00:22:40.301 --> 00:22:43.760
television as well as who come to the event.
So,
um,

411
00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:48.520
of course things like HD cameras and HD televisions were deployed or all around

412
00:22:48.521 --> 00:22:50.320
the stadium where the events held,

413
00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:54.430
bringing the sport kind of up to the level that you see in the NFL and the NBA.

414
00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:58.650
Um,
the experience was improved by,
I think they cut maybe 20,000,

415
00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:03.460
something along that it's around 20,000 tickets out of the sales.

416
00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:06.700
So far fewer people came and made it a more enjoyable experience for everybody

417
00:23:06.701 --> 00:23:09.760
that was able to come to the,
to come to the race.
Um,

418
00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:14.260
and really what he was looking to do,
it was looking outside his category.

419
00:23:14.261 --> 00:23:18.070
So rather than stick to the conventions of horse racing and just copying what

420
00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.170
the Kentucky Derby does,
for example,

421
00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:25.200
he looked to what other major sports do what Vegas does.
Um,

422
00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.610
look to entertainment.
Um,

423
00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:31.210
one of his best ideas that I love is he brought in a concert.
I'm a list.

424
00:23:31.211 --> 00:23:34.660
I'm banned.
I think the Goo goo dolls performed the very first time,
um,

425
00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:38.050
right after the,
um,
the next year is triple crown race.

426
00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:41.620
That way people stuck around even after the race,
some,

427
00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:44.010
some didn't actually get in their cars or hopping the trains and,

428
00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:44.920
and create as much.

429
00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:49.850
So it's just these little touches that really made the event that much better.

430
00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:53.270
Um,
uh,
Bobby also notably,

431
00:23:53.271 --> 00:23:56.270
he expanded it from a one day event to a three day event so they can move the

432
00:23:56.271 --> 00:23:59.270
racists out,
um,
and have a better distribution.

433
00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:03.710
So as you look at the Belmont stakes today,
it's,
it's far more modern,

434
00:24:03.711 --> 00:24:08.711
far more appealing to modern sports consumers than it was even just five years

435
00:24:09.171 --> 00:24:13.730
ago.
Um,
and so that,
that really is about the,
the,
the,

436
00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:18.130
the whole chapter talks about how you maintain that unconventional core that

437
00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.490
keeps people interested in your brand.

438
00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:23.080
<v 2>So as we wander away into the fifth and final chapter of the book,</v>

439
00:24:23.081 --> 00:24:26.590
the fifth and final principle of the book we started really with,

440
00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:29.470
it's all about a personal style or approach to leadership.

441
00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:34.140
We move our way to organizations and rolling themselves in those beliefs where

442
00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:37.690
brand leaders have to behave their beliefs and then organizations bringing

443
00:24:37.691 --> 00:24:42.430
outsiders in and then behaving not with the orthodoxy but against the orthodoxy.

444
00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:45.910
The fifth and final chapter is pivotal because it really talks about not just

445
00:24:45.911 --> 00:24:49.180
doing things episodically but doing things perpetually.
Um,

446
00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:52.660
Lucas began today's conversation with reference to Gibson Guitars and radio

447
00:24:52.661 --> 00:24:57.220
shack and Brookstone and necco candy brands that at one point in time had done

448
00:24:57.221 --> 00:25:00.550
something fascinating but got stuck doing the same thing.

449
00:25:00.551 --> 00:25:02.650
Repetitiously over time it didn't evolve.

450
00:25:02.651 --> 00:25:07.010
So instead of saying the values persist,
but the manifestations change,

451
00:25:07.011 --> 00:25:10.510
they said the values persist in the manifestations persist as well and

452
00:25:10.511 --> 00:25:12.220
ultimately become less relevant.

453
00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:16.120
So the iconic story we'd like to tell here is Taylor guitars.

454
00:25:16.121 --> 00:25:20.200
And as I shared at the outset,
I'm going to position a failed musician.

455
00:25:20.201 --> 00:25:21.710
But nonetheless,
um,

456
00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:25.300
I grew up having a reverence for Taylor guitars because it was a modern company

457
00:25:25.301 --> 00:25:28.840
that sort of came out of nowhere that unseated a brand like Martin guitars,

458
00:25:28.841 --> 00:25:30.670
which had been around for a very long time.

459
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.390
And the reason they've succeeded in their own words is because they always ask

460
00:25:34.391 --> 00:25:37.600
themselves in 10 years,
in 10 years from now,

461
00:25:37.601 --> 00:25:40.900
will we be happy that we make the choices that we made today?

462
00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:44.650
And if the answer is that in 10 years they will be happier,
more successful,

463
00:25:44.651 --> 00:25:49.450
more fulfilled.
They make choices and decisions and service of a 10 year outcome.

464
00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:52.420
So if they have to change the way they distribute,
they do it.

465
00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:55.870
They didn't buy into the distribution system in Europe.
They knocked it down.

466
00:25:55.871 --> 00:25:57.430
They built their own distribution system.

467
00:25:57.431 --> 00:26:01.270
They learned about hrs policies in Europe and they invested the time Monday to

468
00:26:01.271 --> 00:26:04.210
do it because they felt that owning their own distribution channel would make a

469
00:26:04.211 --> 00:26:08.020
difference if they didn't like the way materials were being manufactured in

470
00:26:08.021 --> 00:26:08.854
their guitars.

471
00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:12.130
They invested in factories in Cameroon and they got involved in fair work

472
00:26:12.131 --> 00:26:15.250
practices and fair wages.
And so they weren't just making guitars.

473
00:26:15.251 --> 00:26:18.490
They were impacting the way that guitars were being made from the outset.

474
00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:22.450
And they have a lovely point of view that the way you carry ideas forward for

475
00:26:22.451 --> 00:26:27.340
generations is you enroll the people who work with you as family and co owners

476
00:26:27.341 --> 00:26:30.820
as well.
So I'll give you some examples that they shared with us.

477
00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:32.440
When the economy went to bad,

478
00:26:32.441 --> 00:26:35.110
rather than laying off a substantial portion of their workforce,

479
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:38.770
they cut everyone back to four days and they got the group together.

480
00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:42.520
And instead of saying,
some of you keep your jobs and some of you lose your jobs,

481
00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.150
they said,
we want everyone to continue to be a part of it,

482
00:26:45.151 --> 00:26:47.460
so we're all going to work four days,
not five.

483
00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.220
And what they did not tell their workforce is in the background.

484
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:54.000
They were keeping track of lost wages and the economy went back to good.

485
00:26:54.001 --> 00:26:57.240
All those people who stayed with them through the four days got paid for that

486
00:26:57.241 --> 00:27:00.700
fifth day in each one that they lost wages for before.
Um,

487
00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:02.490
the other thing that they've subsequently done,

488
00:27:02.491 --> 00:27:05.730
which for us was fascinating and we've got a lot of questions from the press

489
00:27:05.731 --> 00:27:06.564
about it,

490
00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:11.580
is in real time they're picking the successor of their brand today who's cross

491
00:27:11.581 --> 00:27:13.650
training with the founder of the organization.

492
00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:16.980
So what they'd observed is a lot of guitar companies and Gibsons,

493
00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:22.100
a perfect example look to build in volume and take costs out of the system.

494
00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:27.030
So if Gibson one started as the consequence or passion of someone who wants to

495
00:27:27.031 --> 00:27:28.170
build beautiful guitars,

496
00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:32.880
it became the output of a marketing organization that would distribute widely

497
00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:34.830
and distribute cheaply.

498
00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:39.390
And their point of view is eventually that system is going to run out of steam

499
00:27:39.391 --> 00:27:43.230
because what made brands like fender and Gibson so special wasn't wide

500
00:27:43.231 --> 00:27:46.920
distribution and cheap costs is that those brands actually had a story to tell

501
00:27:46.921 --> 00:27:48.720
and values that they held dear.

502
00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:52.410
And so their point of view is they're not going to sell to the highest bidder.

503
00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:56.860
They're going to turn employees into co owners of the brand and they're going to

504
00:27:56.870 --> 00:28:00.860
build their successor today.
So a guy named Andy powers,
uh,

505
00:28:00.861 --> 00:28:04.500
was found after a long search.
He works with Bob Taylor.

506
00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:08.970
They're designing guitars together today and it's in his contract effectively

507
00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.800
that when Bob Taylor moves on,

508
00:28:10.801 --> 00:28:13.680
Andy can't just reissue the old guitars that are made today.

509
00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:17.130
He has to design and build new guitars in the spirit of what Taylor's always

510
00:28:17.131 --> 00:28:19.950
about.
He has to bring the brand forward.
Contractually,

511
00:28:19.951 --> 00:28:24.390
it's also his responsibility to find the next successor.
So Andy contractually,

512
00:28:24.391 --> 00:28:25.890
you can't just come in one day and say,

513
00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:29.770
I hate this place or I'm done with this place and I'll see you later in real

514
00:28:29.771 --> 00:28:31.200
time.
Just as Bob Taylor has done,

515
00:28:31.201 --> 00:28:35.550
he has to find a successor and train him or her and pass values and culture

516
00:28:35.551 --> 00:28:38.670
forward.
And when you think about the brands that maybe you work with,

517
00:28:38.671 --> 00:28:41.860
and I think about the brands that maybe we work with,
I can't tell you that,
that,

518
00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:45.000
that that's a very common attitude in the slide is the vast majority of the

519
00:28:45.001 --> 00:28:46.440
brands are concerned with today.

520
00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:49.230
The vast majority of brands are concerned with quarterly reporting,

521
00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:52.800
maximizing shareholder revenue.
It's the few,

522
00:28:52.801 --> 00:28:57.270
not the many that think about growing cultures and values first and finding ways

523
00:28:57.271 --> 00:28:59.520
to perpetuate it forward.
Um,

524
00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:02.730
we often get a lot of heads nodding and people saying it sounds ideal and it

525
00:29:02.731 --> 00:29:03.660
sounds beautiful.

526
00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:07.710
Why is it that more brands are not behaving this way to which the answer is

527
00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:11.220
because it's hard because when economy goes to bad,

528
00:29:11.221 --> 00:29:14.880
you're inclined to save money,
make more money,
save money,

529
00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:18.900
sell more product,
let go of staff to save on wages.

530
00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:23.610
And these are companies that are doubling down on culture.
Lucas reminded me,

531
00:29:23.611 --> 00:29:27.600
the Ritz Carlton actually had a lovely solution when the economy went to bad.

532
00:29:27.601 --> 00:29:30.120
They ran a campaign that said to wealthy people,

533
00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:33.660
the ones who retained their wealth ish.
Um,

534
00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.930
if you can't take the vacation that you want this year,

535
00:29:35.970 --> 00:29:39.110
you shouldn't go on vacation.
Don't just spend money because you think to,

536
00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:43.390
you need to spend it.
Um,
don't go in fewer vacations.

537
00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:47.170
Um,
to save and only to save.
They effectively said,

538
00:29:47.171 --> 00:29:48.610
get your priorities right in life.

539
00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:51.430
Think about the things that matter most where things matter most.

540
00:29:51.431 --> 00:29:55.720
Spend more time and money there and where things matter least save your money,

541
00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:57.160
invest your time elsewhere.

542
00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:00.280
And those are brave things for brands to take a leadership point of view.

543
00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:03.460
The most surprising fact of that story is of all the brands and the Marriott

544
00:30:03.461 --> 00:30:04.270
portfolio,

545
00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:07.640
the Ritz Carlton was the number one leading brand in the down years after

546
00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:11.950
recession.
The brand that charged the most,
we're really a person could say,

547
00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:14.830
I could get a room anywhere,
a bedroom,
anywhere,
a conference room,

548
00:30:14.831 --> 00:30:17.740
anywhere I could sleep in any hotel.
I don't need to go there.

549
00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:22.810
They got more revenue per available room night from customers because they held

550
00:30:22.811 --> 00:30:26.680
tight to their values and they came out recession on top.
Um,

551
00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:29.950
so I'll turn it over to Lucas to sort of sum up the stories.
Um,

552
00:30:29.951 --> 00:30:32.710
we have another little piece at the end that we'll talk about quickly and very

553
00:30:32.711 --> 00:30:34.720
happy to answer a questions.

554
00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:38.500
It's a topic we're very passionate about and it's amazing that in the time we've

555
00:30:38.501 --> 00:30:42.820
written the book,
as Lucas said,
necco bankruptcy,
radio shack,

556
00:30:42.821 --> 00:30:44.930
bankruptcy,
bankruptcy in three years,

557
00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:48.910
blockbuster down to basically finally near done.

558
00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:54.250
It's not a proud moment to say what the costs of what's happening in the world

559
00:30:54.251 --> 00:30:57.190
around us because what's happening around us isn't a wonderful thing.

560
00:30:57.191 --> 00:31:00.640
Brands that we thought would be around forever disappearing.
Um,

561
00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:03.910
but it's a special thing to have knowledge from the ones who found ways to

562
00:31:03.911 --> 00:31:06.700
thrive.
So turn it over to Lucas to sum it up.

563
00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:07.541
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

564
00:31:07.541 --> 00:31:11.920
So that the beginning of the book process was really sitting down with all these

565
00:31:11.921 --> 00:31:14.860
lessons,
all these stories,
and starting to say,
where are the common themes,

566
00:31:14.861 --> 00:31:18.190
where the chapter breaks,
what,
what are,
what are the takeaways for this?
Um,

567
00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:21.160
and what we started to see was something we've come to call the modern legacy

568
00:31:21.161 --> 00:31:25.090
mindset.
And that's the,
the five core chapter ideas.
Um,

569
00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:28.240
traditional band brand leaders will follow organizational principles,

570
00:31:28.241 --> 00:31:30.100
institutional rules.
Um,

571
00:31:30.101 --> 00:31:33.400
what we found modern legacy builders doing is following longterm personal

572
00:31:33.401 --> 00:31:35.890
ambitions.
Um,
that's the first chapter.

573
00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:41.110
A traditional rand leaders will lean into saying one thing,
doing another,

574
00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:43.030
a lot of attitude,
a lot of posturing,

575
00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:46.990
modern legacy builders really behave their beliefs and their values.
Uh,

576
00:31:46.991 --> 00:31:50.230
the third chapter about letting outsiders in a traditional brand leaders

577
00:31:50.231 --> 00:31:53.300
followup can command and control model.
Um,
I'll still love it.

578
00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:56.260
This is a very difficult thing for modern brands to do.
Um,

579
00:31:56.440 --> 00:32:00.280
but modern legacy brands step outside of that and let outsiders in and really

580
00:32:00.281 --> 00:32:04.360
let consumers take a role in the brand and they build a lot of influence that

581
00:32:04.361 --> 00:32:09.130
way.
Um,
the Fourth Chapter I talked about the Belmont stakes,
uh,
that's all about,

582
00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:11.290
uh,
being unconventional.
Um,

583
00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:14.440
traditional bullet brand leaders will stick to their category and follow the

584
00:32:14.441 --> 00:32:15.274
Orthodox of,

585
00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:18.640
of the business that they're in a modern legacy brands that are really willing

586
00:32:18.641 --> 00:32:20.380
to break the category,
um,

587
00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:23.860
via category of one and define their own category.

588
00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:27.220
And the fifth chapter the mark just spoke about with Taylor guitars is about

589
00:32:27.221 --> 00:32:28.001
being perpetual.

590
00:32:28.001 --> 00:32:31.360
A lot of brand leaders will evolve episodically when they need to.

591
00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:35.140
I'm repeating what they do well until it's absolutely necessary to completely

592
00:32:35.141 --> 00:32:39.710
change.
Um,
and what we see is the brands like a Gibson Guitars,

593
00:32:39.711 --> 00:32:43.250
toys r US blockbuster,
they wait too long.

594
00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:47.330
It's a short term mindset and you wind up seeing them go bankrupt or out of

595
00:32:47.331 --> 00:32:48.510
business.
Um,

596
00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:51.820
brand leaders that are building modern legacies are evolving all the time to

597
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:52.700
constant process.

598
00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:55.520
<v 2>It's going to add one of the,</v>

599
00:32:55.521 --> 00:32:58.970
the questions we often get asked is it all sounds so ideal,

600
00:32:58.971 --> 00:33:02.630
but that these companies make money as well.
The ones that you studied.
Uh,

601
00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:05.930
the balance of not entirely all the brands in the bulk are brands that are

602
00:33:05.931 --> 00:33:09.080
succeeding in not just cultural terms,
put financial terms,

603
00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:14.560
I'll share a story and a half.
One is from a leader in the first chapter,
uh,

604
00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:17.450
named Tony Co who launched a brand called Nick's cosmetics.

605
00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:20.300
And she had a very strong point of view though it is a leader,

606
00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:22.160
of course you want to leave with culture and values,

607
00:33:22.161 --> 00:33:25.310
but you need to make money as well because money allows you to hire people,
grow,

608
00:33:25.311 --> 00:33:26.330
pay healthcare,

609
00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:29.180
who wants to work for a leader that tells you they don't want to make money.

610
00:33:29.181 --> 00:33:33.080
So our,
our thinking philosophy is not do good and don't make money.

611
00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:36.710
Our philosophy I think very much is do good and as a consequence other good

612
00:33:36.711 --> 00:33:39.240
things will happen including making money.
Um,

613
00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:41.150
the other piece that I wanted to share is,
um,

614
00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:44.910
the foreword for the book is definitely worth reading.
Um,

615
00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:47.630
we'll tell you how to get a copy of the book next week,

616
00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:50.210
but if you haven't read the book and you just want to see a tease,

617
00:33:50.211 --> 00:33:53.000
we can send you a link.
The Ford from the book is now online.

618
00:33:53.001 --> 00:33:57.890
It was written by Yvon Chouinard is the founder of Patagonia and Yvonne,

619
00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:02.450
um,
in the past year became famous once again,
he,

620
00:34:02.451 --> 00:34:07.000
a famous guy,
um,
for posting on is for,
for sale websites,

621
00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:08.510
commercial website,
uh,

622
00:34:08.511 --> 00:34:11.060
the Patagonia brand that the president just sold your land.

623
00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:13.630
And so you could agree with his politics or not.

624
00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:16.010
We're not taking a stand on that.
Um,

625
00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:19.490
but what we will take a stand on is he's a guy that put his values out front.

626
00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:19.911
He said,

627
00:34:19.911 --> 00:34:23.570
my brand believes in nature and park lands and the ability to enjoy them today

628
00:34:23.571 --> 00:34:24.770
and for generations to come.

629
00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:28.370
And I perceive the government is threatening what my brand holds dear.

630
00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:31.850
And so right up in his home page,
he said,
the president stole your land.

631
00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.220
As it turns out,
in that same year,

632
00:34:34.221 --> 00:34:36.890
it was the most profitable year that Patagonia has ever had.

633
00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:40.680
So for the ones who questioned the value of,
um,

634
00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:45.000
good ethics and high ideals and longterm ambition,
um,
he,

635
00:34:45.130 --> 00:34:48.830
he is proof positive that you can do it at a very high level of being very

636
00:34:48.831 --> 00:34:50.460
successful as well.
Um,

637
00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:53.300
the last thing that I'll leave you with before we sort of opened up if there

638
00:34:53.301 --> 00:34:56.650
happened to be questions is we often get asked,
uh,

639
00:34:56.830 --> 00:34:59.750
by folks how can they get involved in some of the work that we're doing.

640
00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:03.410
We never started out with the ambition of a for profit business,

641
00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:06.260
but we've been approached about helping people with branding.

642
00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:08.340
So we do that gladly.
Um,

643
00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:10.940
we didn't begin with the idea that we were going to write a book.

644
00:35:10.941 --> 00:35:13.190
We began researching and earnest,
as I said,

645
00:35:13.191 --> 00:35:16.880
obviously about to become a dad and I want to learn from people that I admired.

646
00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:17.870
Um,

647
00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:22.410
and yet it became such an interesting topic that every time we spoke to a leader

648
00:35:22.411 --> 00:35:23.990
or they'd refer us to a friend,

649
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:27.790
they'd asked for a transcript because they never told the story before.
Um,

650
00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:29.630
and so here are ways that you can get involved.

651
00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:34.010
If you have a story that you think is worth covering,
um,

652
00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:35.050
please share it with us.

653
00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:38.400
The book has brands that are a hundred years and older and as brands that are 10

654
00:35:38.401 --> 00:35:40.560
years and younger,
it has brands that are 40 years old.

655
00:35:40.561 --> 00:35:43.620
Our philosophy is legacy is something that you would write every day cause

656
00:35:43.621 --> 00:35:47.010
you're either running it every day or do you become a part of ancient history?

657
00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:51.000
People read what you want's to.
So if you know someone,
please share it with us.

658
00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:53.700
If you happen to have a story,
this is your personal story,

659
00:35:53.701 --> 00:35:57.600
your work here or a side hustle.
Um,
share it with us.

660
00:35:57.601 --> 00:35:58.740
We're interested in that.

661
00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:01.940
The other thing that we've done is we've created a foundation.
Um,

662
00:36:01.941 --> 00:36:03.870
so our commitment was yet again,

663
00:36:03.871 --> 00:36:07.050
because we weren't doing this strictly to make money or are initially ever to

664
00:36:07.051 --> 00:36:09.720
make money,
was that anytime something good happened,

665
00:36:09.721 --> 00:36:13.630
we'd reinvest it in people who live and work this way.
So,
uh,

666
00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:16.170
two years ago we ran a program called legacy honors.

667
00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:20.610
I'm David Remnick from the New Yorker was a recipient as a refound or of the

668
00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:24.890
year and before he collaborated or bulky,
Vaughn was a founder of the year,
um,

669
00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:28.110
and they got bursaries that they passed forward to businesses that they felt

670
00:36:28.111 --> 00:36:29.430
should persist for a long time.

671
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:33.330
So He von gave $10,000 to Doctors Without Borders because he felt that

672
00:36:33.331 --> 00:36:36.210
healthcare is a basic human right.
And if you're an adventure,

673
00:36:36.211 --> 00:36:37.920
you may need healthcare at some point.

674
00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:41.790
And David gave his to the committee to protect journalism because he felt in the

675
00:36:41.791 --> 00:36:44.790
environment that we operate in journalists,
we're not getting the fair do.

676
00:36:44.791 --> 00:36:48.450
And they were putting their lives on the line and he passed $10,000 forward to

677
00:36:48.451 --> 00:36:51.150
them.
Next week on the 28th of the month,

678
00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:55.280
almost right around the corner at our agency called team won,
uh,

679
00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:57.990
with inc magazine.
We're announcing the first ever young,

680
00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:59.850
effectively young legacy makers,

681
00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:02.700
the ones who don't have fully formed and established businesses,

682
00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:06.840
but who are making active change to the way culture and society work and behave.

683
00:37:06.841 --> 00:37:09.140
Today,
there are five recipients.
Um,

684
00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:12.240
they're too young activists who are 11 years old who'd been in the news a fair

685
00:37:12.241 --> 00:37:13.110
amount recently.

686
00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:17.910
They're two slightly older but still young activists who've gotten notoriety,

687
00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:20.150
um,
on a Forbes list.
Um,

688
00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:25.220
and there's a young interesting filmmaker who's gotten notoriety at the Sundance

689
00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:28.560
Film Festival.
Um,
we're passing forward grants to them as well.

690
00:37:28.561 --> 00:37:30.210
So if you're curious to come here more,

691
00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:33.210
either more about the book and we're giving away free copies of the book if

692
00:37:33.211 --> 00:37:36.660
you'd like that evening,
um,
or to hear the stories about the young legacy makers,

693
00:37:36.661 --> 00:37:39.360
we'd love to have you or your colleagues and peers come and join us.

694
00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:42.090
And with that on behalf of Lucas and me,
um,

695
00:37:42.091 --> 00:37:44.790
I just want to say thank you for giving us some of your time today and joining

696
00:37:44.791 --> 00:37:45.624
us.

697
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:52.390
<v 4>You
have some time for questions.</v>

698
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:54.370
<v 3>F You have a question?</v>

699
00:37:54.371 --> 00:37:58.030
I will toss this in your direction and pass on the microphone.

700
00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:04.000
You want to catch it?
The microphone?
No,

701
00:38:04.001 --> 00:38:08.920
this is good.
This is the micro.
Yes.
I have like three questions,

702
00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:12.640
but I'll [inaudible] I'll ease into them and give other people a chance.

703
00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:15.870
And it was really interesting talk.
Um,
I'm,

704
00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:20.590
I'm wondering how much the advancement of technology,
um,
and you know,

705
00:38:20.591 --> 00:38:22.640
the Internet and how much,
uh,

706
00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:27.310
that has made things move much more quickly,
has,
um,

707
00:38:27.370 --> 00:38:32.320
impacted maybe the newer brands that are trying to establish in terms of,

708
00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:36.970
uh,
their ethics and morals.
Um,

709
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:42.000
because if they're not ethical then and people discover that then it becomes

710
00:38:42.221 --> 00:38:46.870
like a wildfire on the Internet to say like,
this is the,
you know,

711
00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:50.440
the unscrupulous way in which this brand is doing business and that can cause

712
00:38:50.441 --> 00:38:53.950
them to fail a lot faster.
Can you,
can you talk about that a little bit?

713
00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:57.230
<v 0>Yeah,
I see that mark and speak a little bit more on the client side,</v>

714
00:38:57.231 --> 00:39:01.160
but I can say that,
um,
right out of the gate we add an assumption.

715
00:39:01.161 --> 00:39:04.610
When we published this book and started doing the work that we were doing,

716
00:39:04.611 --> 00:39:08.570
that the types of brands that would approach us would be the long standing

717
00:39:08.571 --> 00:39:08.961
brands,

718
00:39:08.961 --> 00:39:13.160
the brands that were in trouble of going out of business and wanting to preserve

719
00:39:13.161 --> 00:39:14.460
their legacy.
Um,

720
00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:18.240
what we found is actually there's the majority of the brands that approaches are

721
00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:22.910
the younger brands,
the newer brands.
Um,
and sometimes brands that are,
are,

722
00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:24.380
uh,
very popular.

723
00:39:24.381 --> 00:39:27.560
They've got some great product but haven't spent the time to say,

724
00:39:27.561 --> 00:39:30.170
what are we about?
Like what,
what do we do?

725
00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:33.460
You can actually share that if you want to show that the tech story that's

726
00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:34.410
probably relevant to the story.

727
00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:37.920
<v 2>The,
uh,
the front of the first chapter is over your thing.</v>

728
00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:40.940
<v 0>I'm thinking about the,
the consulting,
uh,
prior to the book.</v>

729
00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:46.080
<v 2>So there was a company that may or may not be in this neck of the woods,
um,
that,</v>

730
00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:50.720
uh,
likely works in the tech space that came with an interesting proposition,

731
00:39:50.721 --> 00:39:54.630
which was they could tell us what they were building that night.
Um,

732
00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:58.070
but they had a hard time thinking about what they were building in the future.

733
00:39:58.310 --> 00:40:01.310
And it became particularly relevant for them because as they were looking to

734
00:40:01.311 --> 00:40:05.360
mature as an organization,
that investors who were asking hard questions of them,

735
00:40:05.361 --> 00:40:08.690
which is in a sea of companies that are popping up overnight with interesting

736
00:40:08.691 --> 00:40:11.540
things,
why is yours worth backing?

737
00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:16.460
And they're honest assessment of it was they did not know how to answer that

738
00:40:16.461 --> 00:40:20.900
question.
Um,
and that became incredibly important.
And that's fairly common,

739
00:40:20.901 --> 00:40:23.210
which is we see plenty of people who are walking in the agency.
You say,

740
00:40:23.211 --> 00:40:26.990
my goal is I'm going to start a company,
sell it for $1 billion as fast as I can,

741
00:40:26.991 --> 00:40:27.890
and then I'm done.

742
00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:32.870
And our endeavors actually to say our thinking is not for those people are

743
00:40:32.871 --> 00:40:36.350
thinking is not for everyone.
Um,
technology is changing.

744
00:40:36.351 --> 00:40:37.820
Things are moving at a fast pace,

745
00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:40.940
but it's not permission to not have a longterm ambition or a goal.

746
00:40:41.810 --> 00:40:45.620
So the ones who define their businesses only by the hardware or the ones who are

747
00:40:45.621 --> 00:40:48.260
most likely to be copied and imitated quickly at a lower price.

748
00:40:48.261 --> 00:40:52.430
And the ones who say the hardware is simply a manifestation of a larger idea or

749
00:40:52.431 --> 00:40:55.460
the ones who have an opportunity to last for a longer period of time.

750
00:40:55.810 --> 00:40:58.430
The other story that I'll add very quickly is that the start of our first

751
00:40:58.431 --> 00:41:01.430
chapter,
start a baller chapters.
We would rip the stories that a culture,

752
00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:04.970
so the vast majority of stories that we covered or based on primary research,

753
00:41:04.971 --> 00:41:06.080
but the front of every chapter,

754
00:41:06.081 --> 00:41:08.900
you find what was supposed to be an iconic leader,

755
00:41:08.901 --> 00:41:12.320
that everyone in the world would agree is making the kind of positive change

756
00:41:12.350 --> 00:41:14.120
that it eases you into a chapter.

757
00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:17.960
So right at the start of chapter one is Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook and we

758
00:41:17.961 --> 00:41:21.240
wrote about him before.
Of course,
the questions came out about um,

759
00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:24.080
transparency and data.
Um,

760
00:41:24.110 --> 00:41:27.320
and so we've subsequently been asked questions about the degree to which we

761
00:41:27.321 --> 00:41:28.490
stand behind the story and we,

762
00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:30.590
we have the same answer and we feel strongly about it,

763
00:41:30.591 --> 00:41:34.850
which is we didn't write the history book on brands that forever more doing

764
00:41:34.851 --> 00:41:35.840
exceptional things.

765
00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:40.550
We covered a moment in time where leaders and brands were doing exemplary work

766
00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:42.380
and if they want to be in the next book,

767
00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:45.410
they would continue to hold fast to the values that got them there.

768
00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:48.890
And if they abandon them,
they liked,
they wouldn't be in the,
in the next book.

769
00:41:48.891 --> 00:41:52.670
So we actually found it not,
um,
it was a fascinating thing,

770
00:41:52.671 --> 00:41:56.090
which is it forced us in the readers of the book and the press is bell to

771
00:41:56.091 --> 00:41:59.570
confront the reality that we weren't talking about people who should be famous

772
00:41:59.571 --> 00:42:00.800
for what they once did.

773
00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:04.850
We're talking about people who live by their words every single day and help to

774
00:42:04.851 --> 00:42:06.020
write history every day.

775
00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:11.110
<v 4>Yeah,
yeah,
absolutely.</v>

776
00:42:14.910 --> 00:42:18.930
<v 5>In a similar vein,
you talked about blockbuster and radio shack who,
yeah,</v>

777
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.870
their business model kind of went away.
Uh,

778
00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:24.390
but there's a lot of theories about how they could have pivoted or

779
00:42:24.391 --> 00:42:26.580
recontextualized to still exist.

780
00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:30.810
So are there examples of companies that kind of maintain their legacy and values

781
00:42:30.811 --> 00:42:33.470
while having to change what they did pretty fundamentally?

782
00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:35.700
<v 0>It's interesting you say that,
that the,</v>

783
00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:38.970
the story that we also put in the book in the very beginning is Kodak too.

784
00:42:38.971 --> 00:42:41.810
We would kind of bunched those three together as cautionary tales.

785
00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:45.950
And I love the Codec version as a cautionary tale because they actually invented

786
00:42:45.951 --> 00:42:50.951
the digital camera back in like 1974 and somebody brought it to an executive and

787
00:42:51.711 --> 00:42:54.430
the executive said this would ruin our photo business.
We've,

788
00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:57.680
we have printing booths everywhere.
That's all our revenue.

789
00:42:58.190 --> 00:43:00.560
Like this is not something that we want to put out there.
So they,

790
00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:04.610
they buried the invention and ultimately it was their demise.
Um,
so it's a,

791
00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:09.420
it's a fascinating little case study.
Um,
as far as,
um,

792
00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:11.090
brands that have transitioned.

793
00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:14.930
What I do think is interesting is some of the brands in the book will come to us

794
00:43:14.931 --> 00:43:17.780
and say,
the honest company is a good example there,
right here,

795
00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:22.010
right around the corner.
They'll tell you,
we build these products.
You know,
we're,

796
00:43:22.011 --> 00:43:23.730
we,
we sell these products.
Um,

797
00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:26.930
but tomorrow we could be selling something entirely different because it's the

798
00:43:26.931 --> 00:43:31.420
values and our mission,
um,
aren't necessarily about the products.
Um,

799
00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:35.150
the honest company for example,
is about a cleaner,
greener world.
Um,

800
00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:37.220
they could be be making clothing next year.

801
00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:39.530
It would still stay true to that principle.

802
00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:41.690
They would just be doing that in a different industry.

803
00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:44.630
I've been surprised by how many times we've heard that.
Um,

804
00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:46.720
but you can you think of examples or a

805
00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:49.220
<v 2>Ritz Carlton's another reasonable one,</v>

806
00:43:49.221 --> 00:43:52.250
which is in response to the question in a hundred years from now,

807
00:43:52.251 --> 00:43:53.270
what do you hope persist?

808
00:43:53.271 --> 00:43:55.760
One of the founding members was very reflective and he said,

809
00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.760
if the hotels look the same and if people dressed the same,

810
00:43:58.761 --> 00:44:02.150
and if people act in exactly the same way that people fundamentally

811
00:44:02.151 --> 00:44:05.540
misunderstand what this brand is all about.
We're about ladies and gentlemen,

812
00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:07.370
Treating People as ladies and gentlemen,

813
00:44:07.371 --> 00:44:10.400
we're about graciousness and manners and a world that is often without them.

814
00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:14.090
And to a degree,
we're about creating memories that last a lifetime.

815
00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:16.460
So it's not just about a two or three nights day,

816
00:44:16.461 --> 00:44:19.520
it's about us a seven memory stay for example.

817
00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:23.510
And his point was we teach culture and value every day.

818
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:27.200
And that's why today we have hotels and tomorrow we're going to have yachts and

819
00:44:27.201 --> 00:44:28.330
beyond that,
um,

820
00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:31.350
the Ritz Carlton might manifest as something fundamentally different than a

821
00:44:31.351 --> 00:44:32.730
conventional hotel company.

822
00:44:33.050 --> 00:44:36.500
They've got an interesting phone call from I'm a documentarian,
uh,

823
00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:39.510
group is making a documentary and they said,

824
00:44:39.511 --> 00:44:42.000
we're going to cover airbnb and we're going to cover the Ritz Carlton is

825
00:44:42.001 --> 00:44:46.830
examples of,
um,
iconic,
successful hospitality spaces today.

826
00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:50.860
And their question was,
which hotels do you want us to document?

827
00:44:50.861 --> 00:44:54.830
And the Ritz Carlton said,
um,
uh,
effectively we don't care.
And they said,
what?

828
00:44:54.831 --> 00:44:57.540
W what do you mean?
Which are the hotels you want to show off?

829
00:44:57.541 --> 00:44:59.940
And they said any of them and none of them,

830
00:44:59.941 --> 00:45:02.910
because what defines us that are not the walls will tell you the people that

831
00:45:02.911 --> 00:45:05.970
we'd like you to document it because we think the people in the style of service

832
00:45:05.971 --> 00:45:10.410
is the thing that lives on.
And it took the media company while to digest it,

833
00:45:10.411 --> 00:45:12.750
but when they understood,
they said,
yeah,
I guess that what,

834
00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:15.990
that's what makes you an airbnb fundamentally different ones about the spaces

835
00:45:15.991 --> 00:45:16.860
that you occupy.

836
00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:19.710
And one's about the heath interactions you have to no matter where you go.

837
00:45:19.711 --> 00:45:22.590
And they said yes,
that's what we hope lives for a hundred years.

838
00:45:22.591 --> 00:45:24.780
Those human interactions.
Um,

839
00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:27.990
so over time we'll look to plus those stories.

840
00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:32.740
But I think honest is one in the making.
I think Ritz is a brand that's um,

841
00:45:32.970 --> 00:45:37.040
more than 30 years old.
It's probably not a bad one.
And um,

842
00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:42.450
it'd be curious to see what happens with brands like bluebird over time.
Um,

843
00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:43.740
there were fascinating story.

844
00:45:43.741 --> 00:45:48.420
They refuse to knock down the walls and make it a venue for thousands of people.

845
00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:52.290
They say that if the performers can't see the audience,

846
00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:55.590
the experience dies and yet they're looking for ways to transport that

847
00:45:55.591 --> 00:45:58.680
experience all over the world that doesn't violate their culture and values.

848
00:45:58.830 --> 00:45:59.850
Somebody a curious,
one

849
00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:08.090
<v 6>question about legacy when it comes to um,</v>

850
00:46:08.650 --> 00:46:10.750
industries making significant shifts.

851
00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:14.320
So like you guys are from [inaudible] automotive industry is working to be like

852
00:46:14.321 --> 00:46:18.400
more mobility focused instead of selling cars.
And like that's a,

853
00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:22.690
that's a hard,
right?
Right.
Like that's not like a,
Oh,
let's think about this.

854
00:46:22.691 --> 00:46:25.030
They're trying to do it really quickly.
Um,

855
00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:29.440
what's your guys' take on legacy when there's companies that are trying to take

856
00:46:29.441 --> 00:46:31.960
on things that might be outside of their zone?

857
00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:34.433
<v 4>Mm,</v>

858
00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:38.200
<v 2>well,
I can speak to automotive directly,
which is,
um,</v>

859
00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:43.430
that world is changing so dramatically that I believe if you sat down with Akio

860
00:46:43.770 --> 00:46:48.180
Toyoda,
he would tell you mobility,
um,
isn't a made up idea that he would take,

861
00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:50.250
mobility was always a part of the DNA.

862
00:46:50.251 --> 00:46:52.620
Maybe it was not at the top of the pyramid.

863
00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:54.810
Maybe it wasn't always discussing revealed,

864
00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:57.540
but he would tell you the way they move people through the world,

865
00:46:57.541 --> 00:46:59.370
including how they move people through a dealership,

866
00:46:59.371 --> 00:47:01.200
how they move people through an online experience,

867
00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:04.230
how they move people from home to work and be on.

868
00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:06.840
He would tell you it's a part of the truth of the company.

869
00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:10.620
One of the supporters of our book that we're quite proud of is Simon Sinek and

870
00:47:10.621 --> 00:47:13.830
when Simon got involved,
he was skeptical at first.
He said,

871
00:47:13.831 --> 00:47:16.110
I'm sure you're talking to a lot of people who are telling you fairytales and

872
00:47:16.111 --> 00:47:18.210
fantasies about what they wished they would become,

873
00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:20.430
but don't represent the truth of what they are.

874
00:47:20.490 --> 00:47:23.490
And once we started dissecting the stories and going through them,
he,

875
00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:28.260
he became a fan,
particularly of the fast company story.

876
00:47:28.590 --> 00:47:30.820
Um,
and I think he particularly like the Taylor story,

877
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:34.000
but he really challenged us as you're,
you're appropriately doing,

878
00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:34.990
which is to say,

879
00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:39.250
or do you guys just showing the shiny pieces that companies want you to see or

880
00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:43.060
these real elements of the brand?
So for automotive specifically,

881
00:47:43.061 --> 00:47:47.590
I think Toyota has some truth in the notion of mobility and what they look like

882
00:47:47.591 --> 00:47:48.424
tomorrow.

883
00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:52.660
Better be fundamentally different than today because otherwise there'll be dead

884
00:47:52.661 --> 00:47:53.410
and gone.

885
00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:54.580
<v 6>Yeah,
totally.
I just,</v>

886
00:47:54.581 --> 00:47:57.790
I look at Mark Fields and what they were doing with Ford and it's like,
you know,

887
00:47:57.791 --> 00:48:00.370
the FordPass totally tanked,
right?
And it's like,
how,

888
00:48:00.490 --> 00:48:04.450
how are you going to do this the right way?
And it is,
it's a,
it's a big change,

889
00:48:04.451 --> 00:48:06.630
right?
So the,
you're right about the DNA of [inaudible].

890
00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:08.980
It always being about mobility,
but it's like,

891
00:48:08.981 --> 00:48:11.890
how do you do it the right way and how do you buy yourself enough time?
Uh,

892
00:48:11.891 --> 00:48:13.450
which is another key piece of it.

893
00:48:13.451 --> 00:48:17.020
Like when you're talking about switching from going from selling cars or

894
00:48:17.021 --> 00:48:19.690
whatever it may be,
to whatever shift you're doing as a company,

895
00:48:19.691 --> 00:48:22.600
like how much of a period of time do you need to change,

896
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:26.050
even if it is part of your legacy change to the dynamics of your business?

897
00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:27.270
I'll shut up now

898
00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:28.950
<v 2>we write it.
We wrote a piece in the book,</v>

899
00:48:28.951 --> 00:48:32.940
it right to the end that talks about the old measurement system was a simple

900
00:48:32.941 --> 00:48:36.480
evaluation of assets and liabilities.
So in a quarter or a year,

901
00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:39.300
what are the things that hold value?
What are the things that are losing value?

902
00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:42.900
And we've worked with a semiotician in London and built a model,

903
00:48:42.901 --> 00:48:45.120
which is concurrently looking at latent value.

904
00:48:45.121 --> 00:48:48.570
Those things that still have value,
but if you don't evolve,
it becomes useless.

905
00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:51.480
And concurrently looking at the things that you change in real time.

906
00:48:51.481 --> 00:48:53.910
Because if you're not looking at head and creating things that don't exist,

907
00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:58.890
you're going to find out that your Alexis is unseated by Tesla and blockbusters

908
00:48:58.891 --> 00:49:01.980
unseated by Netflix because they never bothered to pay attention.

909
00:49:01.981 --> 00:49:05.490
And Ritz Carlton could be unseeded by Airbnb because they were late to the

910
00:49:05.491 --> 00:49:10.440
timeshare game.
Yeah.
So we do think it's a fundamental shift.
On the one hand,
the,

911
00:49:10.441 --> 00:49:14.910
the idea that,
um,
repeat the past,
if I just do that,

912
00:49:14.911 --> 00:49:18.180
I can't fail many understand that even if it fails,

913
00:49:18.181 --> 00:49:21.360
who could say that I was wrong for doing what one sport?
Equally,

914
00:49:21.361 --> 00:49:25.350
we see the ones who say,
screw the past the pastors in the past.

915
00:49:25.410 --> 00:49:29.280
I'm here for my three year tenure as a CMO or CEO.
It's a whole new future.

916
00:49:29.281 --> 00:49:31.380
I'm going to make my mark,
build my resume,
move on.

917
00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:33.870
The hardest things to actually reconcile the two.

918
00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:37.450
What are the pieces of the passport thing con to and what are those elements in

919
00:49:37.451 --> 00:49:39.930
my dirty that we better add or we're going to fail?
Yeah.

920
00:49:40.170 --> 00:49:43.890
So I think we have good examples of brands in the making,

921
00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:49.380
and I think this is going to be a constant work in progress.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thank you.

922
00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:50.160
Appreciate your time.
