00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.900
Welcome to toxic Hugo.
I'm mark and I'm here with Paul Smith,

2
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.220
who's a best selling author of a few bucks.
In fact,

3
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.690
lead with a story is one that I read recently and it was a very popular,

4
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.380
also parenting with a story.
I haven't read that yet,
but I have kids,

5
00:00:22.381 --> 00:00:23.700
so I plan to read it.
Same.

6
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.420
Paul spent a couple of years as a consultant at Accenture and 20 years at

7
00:00:30.661 --> 00:00:35.130
Procter and gamble as a director of consumer communications research.

8
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.660
He's a popular keynote speaker.
He's been featured in the Wall Street Journal,

9
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.320
Inc Magazine Times,
Forbes,
success magazine,

10
00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:47.790
a lot of big publications.
So Paul,
thanks a lot for joining us.
Very welcome.

11
00:00:47.791 --> 00:00:48.960
It's good to be here.
Yeah.
Great.

12
00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:52.950
So tell us a little bit about this book sell with a story that you just wrote.

13
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.540
<v 0>Yeah.
So,
uh,
I will,
as you can tell,
it's kind of the,
the third in a series.</v>

14
00:00:57.541 --> 00:01:01.140
And I guess I didn't really know when I started,
I was going to write a trilogy,

15
00:01:01.141 --> 00:01:03.930
I guess it is,
but it kind of worked out that way.
Um,
but,

16
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.620
but they're all about how to use storytelling to make you more effective at

17
00:01:07.621 --> 00:01:08.910
whatever it is that,
that you're doing.

18
00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:11.380
So the first one obviously is to help you be a better leader.

19
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.350
The second one to be a more effective parent.

20
00:01:13.351 --> 00:01:16.360
And this one obviously to be more effective at selling.
And,

21
00:01:16.361 --> 00:01:19.370
and that is not just if you're selling a thing,
a product,

22
00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:22.230
a or it could be a service or it could just be your ideas.
A lot of us,

23
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.860
a lot of them are trafficking,
trafficking in ideas.

24
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.460
So even if that's just making a presentation to your boss or we're making a

25
00:01:29.461 --> 00:01:32.050
recommendation around the office,
that kind of thing.
Uh,
so it's,

26
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.470
it's t to use storytelling to help you be more effective.

27
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.380
<v 2>Yeah.
Great.
Well,
I can definitely use that.
I'm in sales,</v>

28
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.280
so I've read the book and I found some Nice tidbits there.
Good,
good.
Um,

29
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.480
what exactly is storytelling for business?

30
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.810
So tell us more about how a salesperson can use storytelling.

31
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.920
<v 0>Yeah.
Well,
so I,
I,
I think that word storytelling has been used,
um,</v>

32
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.680
a lot lately.
And for things that it probably was never intended to be used for,

33
00:01:57.681 --> 00:02:02.600
you know,
a 15 or 20 years ago when somebody were to say a story,

34
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.920
you would know exactly what they meant.
But,

35
00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.950
but these days I think people use it for different things.
Ya know,

36
00:02:06.951 --> 00:02:10.640
nowadays you'll hear people say,
oh,
our,
our marketing plans a story or are,

37
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.490
you know,
our,
our new copy on air,

38
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.400
it tells a story or a mission statement tells a story or a brand logo is a
story.

39
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.690
And,
and,
uh,

40
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.320
if people can get some extra meaning in their work by calling those things

41
00:02:21.321 --> 00:02:25.730
stories,
then that's great.
But,
um,
but they're probably not really stories.

42
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.800
Uh,
there is a difference.
You know,

43
00:02:27.801 --> 00:02:31.610
not every set of words that has meaning a is a story.

44
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.810
Just like not every set of words,
uh,
that's,
uh,
that's entertaining is a poem.

45
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.020
I mean,
their,
their story is something different.
So when I say storytelling,

46
00:02:39.021 --> 00:02:42.110
I actually mean telling a story about something that happened to somebody.

47
00:02:42.111 --> 00:02:46.730
I don't just mean making a compelling speech or writing a great memo.

48
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.740
Um,
you know,
uh,
in fact,
imagine a,
so you're in sales,
so imagine it's next week.

49
00:02:51.741 --> 00:02:52.160
Uh,
you're,

50
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.250
you're sitting down on a meeting to prepare for a sales call that you've got

51
00:02:55.251 --> 00:02:59.470
coming up,
uh,
with a new perspective client.
And the boss comes in to the meeting,

52
00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:04.300
started and says,
okay,
let's get this meeting started.
What's our story?

53
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.770
You know,

54
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.940
do you think for a minute that what that person means is his story in the

55
00:03:09.941 --> 00:03:12.010
traditional sense?
Probably not.

56
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.160
But what they probably mean is what's the logical series of facts and data and

57
00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:19.000
arguments that we're going to put together probably in a PowerPoint presentation

58
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.930
that we're going to essentially read to the client or the prospect such that by

59
00:03:22.931 --> 00:03:26.140
the end of the meeting,
we have the best odds of success at selling something.

60
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.070
That's what they mean by a story.
And that's,
that's great.
Uh,

61
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.590
because you need that when you're going into a sales call.

62
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.820
But we wouldn't have called that 20 years ago a story we would have called that

63
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.760
a sales pitch or presentation slides or a message track or talking points or

64
00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:40.540
something.

65
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.290
So I'm not talking about talking points or message tracks were sales pitches.

66
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.730
I'm talking about actual stories.
In fact,
it might help if I gave you an example.

67
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.730
Right?
Yeah.
So,
um,
so last year,

68
00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:53.410
and this was the one that actually happened to me personally,

69
00:03:53.411 --> 00:03:55.620
so last summer my wife and I were at a,
um,
uh,

70
00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.280
an art fair and she was looking for,
uh,

71
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.930
a piece of art for our son's bathroom at home.
And so we get,

72
00:04:01.931 --> 00:04:04.900
we're going booth to booth and we get to this booth of this one artist,

73
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.880
he's an underwater photographer,

74
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.170
his name is Chris Goog and he just does these mesmerizing underwater shots of

75
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.970
sea anemones and sea turtles and coral reefs and stuff like that.
And uh,

76
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.990
she gets attached to this one picture that to me looked about as out of place as

77
00:04:19.991 --> 00:04:21.160
a pig in the ocean,
right?

78
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.420
Because it was literally a pig in the ocean picture of a pig in the ocean.

79
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.280
And I just thought that was the craziest thing.

80
00:04:27.281 --> 00:04:30.850
And eventually I got my turn to ask a question of the the photographer and I

81
00:04:30.851 --> 00:04:34.420
said,
dude,
once with the pig and the ocean,
right.

82
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.140
And that is when the magic started.
I mean,
he said,
Oh yeah,

83
00:04:38.141 --> 00:04:39.340
it was the craziest thing.
He said,

84
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.270
that picture was taken in The Bahamas off the coast of this uninhabited island

85
00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.900
called big major cay.
Instead.
Apparently what happened was a few years ago,

86
00:04:46.901 --> 00:04:50.110
a local entrepreneur decided to raise a pig farm for Bacon,
I guess.

87
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.130
And so he goes and buys this whole drove of pigs and he puts them out on this

88
00:04:54.131 --> 00:04:55.450
island where you can keep them for free.

89
00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.400
And he said any points of the picture and goes,

90
00:04:57.401 --> 00:05:00.370
but look up there behind the pig on the beach.
And he said,

91
00:05:00.371 --> 00:05:02.830
right behind the beach,
what kind of vegetation do you see up there?

92
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.200
And I looked and I kind of squinted and I said,
well,

93
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.940
the only thing I recognize or Cactus,
and he said,
yeah,
that's a problem.

94
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.170
Pigs don't like cactus is that these poor pigs weren't thriving.

95
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.640
They couldn't eat.
It's hard to eat a cactus.
Right?
And,
uh,
fortunately for them,

96
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:19.030
uh,

97
00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.810
they quickly noticed that a local restaurant owner on a neighboring island was

98
00:05:22.811 --> 00:05:27.130
boating his kitchen refuse every night over the big major cay and dumping it a

99
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.963
few dozen yards off shore.

100
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.850
So pretty soon these hungry little pigs smell the food and they,

101
00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.020
they're hungry enough that they are,

102
00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:36.010
they brave the ocean waters and eventually figured out how to get out there and

103
00:05:36.011 --> 00:05:39.460
get the food first one pig then to announce two or three generations later and

104
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.630
all the pigs on big major cay can swim.
So,
and he said,
in fact,

105
00:05:43.631 --> 00:05:45.490
now that nobody even calls it big major cay anymore,

106
00:05:45.491 --> 00:05:47.290
everybody calls it pig island,
right?
So if you,

107
00:05:47.291 --> 00:05:48.280
for those of you that have heard of it,

108
00:05:48.281 --> 00:05:50.500
if you ever go to the Caribbean and go check out pig island and then these,

109
00:05:50.501 --> 00:05:53.230
there are these pigs and they swim.
And he said,
in fact,

110
00:05:53.231 --> 00:05:55.150
I didn't even have to get out of my boat.

111
00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.490
Like normally I have to put on all this scuba gear and wet suit and stuff and it

112
00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:01.820
takes hours to get my pictures.
He said when I got two big major cay,

113
00:06:01.821 --> 00:06:04.760
I just leaned over and stuck my camera out of the water because the pigs swim

114
00:06:04.761 --> 00:06:07.610
right up to the boat.
Yeah.
Cause they think they're going to get fed,
right.

115
00:06:07.611 --> 00:06:10.610
They've learned that boat's mean food.
Right.
All right.
So anyway,

116
00:06:10.611 --> 00:06:12.470
I'm of course at that point I've got my credit card out and I'm like,

117
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.230
we'll take it.
Right.
Totally sold that picture.
And you know,

118
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.520
of course it did,
right?
I mean,
two minutes earlier,

119
00:06:19.521 --> 00:06:20.810
that picture was worth nothing to me.

120
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.410
But after hearing that Short two minute story,
I was like,
I gotta have this.

121
00:06:24.411 --> 00:06:28.130
Right.
And why?
Because now I wasn't just buying a picture.

122
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.850
I was buying a story and it's a story I get to tell everybody that comes into my

123
00:06:31.851 --> 00:06:36.530
house.
And uh,
and it's,
it's also,
it's a,
it's an animal psychology lesson,

124
00:06:36.531 --> 00:06:39.830
a history lesson,
a geography lesson,
all kind of rolled into one.
Right.

125
00:06:39.831 --> 00:06:43.700
It's just an interesting story.
So that's when I say sales story,

126
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.370
that's what I mean.
I don't mean Paul here.

127
00:06:46.371 --> 00:06:48.050
The three reasons why you got to buy this picture.

128
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:49.670
It is the right size for your bathroom,

129
00:06:49.671 --> 00:06:52.090
it's the right color Palette for your no towels.
You know what?

130
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:53.450
And it's priced just right.

131
00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:57.500
I mean that's a satisfaction logic and emotion and uh,
yeah,

132
00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:00.050
purchasing decision I imagine,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.

133
00:07:00.051 --> 00:07:04.010
Most sales pitches are very logical and quite frankly,
their list.

134
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.450
It's a list of the reasons why you should buy this.
Can,

135
00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.360
I'm not talking about sales lists,

136
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.000
sales stories are something very different like that.
And that,
by the way,

137
00:07:11.001 --> 00:07:13.730
that's just one type of story.
I mean there's,

138
00:07:13.731 --> 00:07:16.940
there's 20 some odd types of sales stories that I talk about in the book.

139
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:20.090
That particular one is what I call a value adding story.

140
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:24.080
It's a story that makes the thing that you're selling more valuable,
right?

141
00:07:24.081 --> 00:07:25.310
But there are lots of other kinds as well.

142
00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.780
So how would a sales person come up with stories like this?

143
00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:34.910
Yeah,
yeah.
So first of all,
be observant,
right?
I mean,
you know,
that's,

144
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:38.960
that thing actually happened to me at that art fair and it made an impression on

145
00:07:38.961 --> 00:07:40.130
me,
so I remembered it.
Right?

146
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:44.720
So the first thing you've got to do is to recognize that what you need as a

147
00:07:44.721 --> 00:07:47.960
salesperson is a repertoire of stories to tell.

148
00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:52.880
So when you see a story happen or hear a great story,

149
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:55.160
don't just enjoy it and let it pass through your brain.

150
00:07:55.161 --> 00:07:59.270
Recognize that's something important.
Like if it moved you in some way,

151
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:03.680
it will move other people when you tell them.
So collected just like you would

152
00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.930
just like you would a f a fact or an interesting argument or a good piece of

153
00:08:08.931 --> 00:08:11.780
analysis or super compelling piece of data.

154
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:14.780
Like if you heard that during your workday,
oh I'm gonna write that down,

155
00:08:14.781 --> 00:08:15.860
I'm going to,
I need that.

156
00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:18.980
I you should be thinking of that way about stories as well,
but,

157
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:22.130
but you can be more intentional about it too.
I'm not like I recommend people,

158
00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:22.500
you know,
in,

159
00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:26.390
in the back of the book is the list of here are the 25 types of sales stories

160
00:08:26.391 --> 00:08:29.180
that you,
you probably need go find them.

161
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:32.180
Like intentionally go on a story hunt,
you know,

162
00:08:32.181 --> 00:08:34.820
and it might take you six months to do it to find all the right ones,

163
00:08:34.821 --> 00:08:37.010
but ask other people,
you know,
to tell people,

164
00:08:37.011 --> 00:08:38.270
here are the stories I'm looking for.

165
00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.580
Just like you would do if you were to tell your colleagues,

166
00:08:40.581 --> 00:08:44.150
Hey I need data on this or I'm looking for this type of analysis.
Right.

167
00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:47.690
Is anybody had this type of experience?
Do the same things with your stories.

168
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:51.470
I'm looking for this kind of a story and eventually you'll get your list of 25

169
00:08:51.471 --> 00:08:53.090
filled out and you'll,
you'll be in a better position.

170
00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:56.010
Or do you recommend using a story every

171
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:57.630
<v 2>time you have a sales meeting?</v>

172
00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:02.860
<v 0>Well probably,
but I should,
I should clarify.</v>

173
00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:06.790
The type of storytelling I'm talking about is not just to be used during the

174
00:09:06.791 --> 00:09:08.100
sales pitch.
Random.

175
00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:10.870
I mean the sales and the people that I interviewed for the book and I

176
00:09:10.871 --> 00:09:13.540
interviewed people at 50 or 60 different companies around the world,

177
00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:16.690
professional salespeople and professional buyers by the way,

178
00:09:16.691 --> 00:09:18.010
professional procurement people.

179
00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:21.130
Cause I figure who better to tell you what sales stories work and which ones

180
00:09:21.131 --> 00:09:22.960
don't.
Then the buyers.
Right.
In fact,

181
00:09:22.961 --> 00:09:25.250
I'm convinced now that I learned more from the buyers and sellers.

182
00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.930
<v 2>Tell me a little bit about how you did all those interviews.</v>

183
00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:31.930
You just contacted buyers all over the place where these people you knew from

184
00:09:31.931 --> 00:09:34.150
your former days at Procter and gamble or,

185
00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:37.400
<v 0>yeah,
some of them.
So I mean I,
I started of course with people that I knew,</v>

186
00:09:37.401 --> 00:09:37.661
but the,

187
00:09:37.661 --> 00:09:41.420
the last question I typically ask in any of my interviews is now that you know

188
00:09:41.421 --> 00:09:44.090
what I'm looking for,
who do you think I should talk to?

189
00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:45.770
And that of course it turns out,
oh,

190
00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.970
Bob and accounting or Jane and sales or you know,
Sally the procurement,

191
00:09:49.971 --> 00:09:52.010
you've got to talk to her.
You know,
so the,

192
00:09:52.011 --> 00:09:55.180
I ended up getting more my interviews that way.
Um,
but yeah,
so the,
the,

193
00:09:55.181 --> 00:09:56.980
the process,
the research,
of course,
I,

194
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:59.000
I typically read all the other books that have been written on the,

195
00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.200
on the topic or as many as I can,
I can get through.
But most of it is these,

196
00:10:03.201 --> 00:10:07.050
these primary interviews that I do with these people all over the world.
Um,

197
00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:11.210
and I ended up reverse engineering my way into what makes for a compelling
story.

198
00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:12.043
But,
um,

199
00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:15.230
one of the questions I was asking them to kind of get back to the other question

200
00:10:15.231 --> 00:10:18.980
is,
when are you using storytelling in the sales process?
And the,

201
00:10:18.981 --> 00:10:22.940
and of course I found out what their sales process is and it turns out

202
00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.930
everybody's got different names for their parts of the sales process.

203
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.660
You could probably articulate right now what your sales process is and do.

204
00:10:29.661 --> 00:10:32.600
The names that you use for those parts would be different than people at other

205
00:10:32.601 --> 00:10:36.110
companies would use.
But they're all pretty similar.
And I mean,

206
00:10:36.111 --> 00:10:39.740
and it starts from as early as identifying who your prospect is that you want to

207
00:10:39.741 --> 00:10:42.920
sell to,
to building rapport with the buyer,

208
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:47.030
to making the actual sales pitch itself,
to resolving objections,

209
00:10:47.031 --> 00:10:51.290
to negotiating price,
to closing the sale to service after the sale.
I mean,

210
00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.720
that probably sounds familiar to you,
right?
Yeah.
So,

211
00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:58.220
so that's kind of storytelling I'm talking about happens in all of those parts,

212
00:10:58.221 --> 00:11:02.510
not just the main sales pitch.
So,
so the,
the best salespeople that I,

213
00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:06.470
that I interviewed were starting their storytelling the minute they met somebody

214
00:11:06.471 --> 00:11:10.190
and it would be a story to help introduce themselves to help the prospect

215
00:11:10.191 --> 00:11:13.280
understand who I am,
what I'm about,
what it is that I do for living.

216
00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:17.690
Then there's the rapport building,
then the actual sales pitch itself.
And yes,

217
00:11:17.691 --> 00:11:19.730
there should be two or three stories out of a,
I don't know,

218
00:11:19.731 --> 00:11:21.050
30 minutes sales call,

219
00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:23.870
seven or eight minutes of that probably ought to be in storytelling.

220
00:11:23.871 --> 00:11:27.380
And the other 23 minutes could be normal sales pitch type stuff.

221
00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:32.240
But then I found great salespeople actually using storytelling to negotiate

222
00:11:32.241 --> 00:11:37.010
price to resolve objections and a really creative way and actually closing the

223
00:11:37.011 --> 00:11:39.970
sale by,
by creating more of a sense of urgency and,

224
00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:44.420
and some really creative uses of storytelling after the sale was made to build

225
00:11:44.421 --> 00:11:48.980
loyalty and get people to,
to be happy with the purchase decision they've made.

226
00:11:48.981 --> 00:11:52.820
And now that I'm doing business with you,
you want me to stay happy,
right?

227
00:11:52.821 --> 00:11:55.660
And storytelling can help there too.
So I was really just surprised,

228
00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:59.380
pleasantly surprised at all the uses of storytelling throughout the entire sales

229
00:11:59.381 --> 00:12:00.214
process.

230
00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:02.690
<v 2>And why is storytelling so powerful?</v>

231
00:12:02.691 --> 00:12:06.020
Why does that convince somebody to buy when they wouldn't have otherwise?

232
00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.100
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
So there,
there are a lot of reasons.
Um,</v>

233
00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.930
my top few I would tell you is first of all,

234
00:12:11.931 --> 00:12:16.931
it turns out that human beings don't make decisions as logically and rationally

235
00:12:17.271 --> 00:12:20.360
as we think we do.
Right?
We like to think we're these logical,

236
00:12:20.361 --> 00:12:22.170
rational thinking machines.
But,
um,

237
00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:24.740
the truth is in that cognitive science has been done,
tells us this,

238
00:12:24.741 --> 00:12:28.100
that human beings make subconscious emotional,

239
00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:31.190
sometimes irrational decisions in one place in their brain.

240
00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:34.850
And then they justify that logically and rationally in a different place in the

241
00:12:34.851 --> 00:12:38.240
brain after the fact.
But that's the conscious part that we remember.

242
00:12:38.241 --> 00:12:39.830
So that's why we think that we're so rational.

243
00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.590
But the truth is our decisions were,
were made,
you know,

244
00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.930
three tenths of a second earlier in the subconscious part.

245
00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:48.860
Facts and logic and data only talk to that conscious,
logical,

246
00:12:48.861 --> 00:12:52.220
rational part of the brain.
They don't talk to the subconscious,
you know,

247
00:12:52.221 --> 00:12:55.970
a emotional part of the brain stories.
Do you need both?
Yeah.
So,

248
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:59.840
and I'm definitely not an advocate of abandoning your logical rational sales

249
00:12:59.841 --> 00:13:02.280
pitch for a story that would be foolish not to.
Um,

250
00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:07.310
I recommend this as something in addition to,
so out of a 30 minute sales call,

251
00:13:07.311 --> 00:13:09.800
instead of having 30 minutes of sales pitch,
you know,

252
00:13:09.801 --> 00:13:12.080
the traditional logic only sales pitch,

253
00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:16.130
you ought to have two or three stories in there to speak to both parts of the

254
00:13:16.131 --> 00:13:17.690
brain.
I think you'd be more effective that way.

255
00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:22.040
<v 2>Was there a point in your career when this topic really became more important</v>

256
00:13:22.041 --> 00:13:25.940
for you and you decided,
hey,
I'm going to write a book on this lead with a story,

257
00:13:25.941 --> 00:13:26.770
for example?

258
00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:31.280
<v 0>Yeah.
So,
uh,
I was probably 15 years into my career when it,</v>

259
00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:34.900
I guess it finally dawned on me that storytelling is important.
I mean,
you know,

260
00:13:34.901 --> 00:13:37.090
they didn't teach me that in business school.
Uh,

261
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:40.750
nobody told me that when I joined P and g or joined Arthur Anderson,
uh,
you know,

262
00:13:40.751 --> 00:13:40.961
I just,

263
00:13:40.961 --> 00:13:44.770
I've just finally dawned on me that the leaders that I admired the most and

264
00:13:44.771 --> 00:13:49.460
wanted to work for or be like when I grew up in the company,
um,

265
00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.050
we're great storytellers.
And so once I realize that,
then I,

266
00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:55.570
I set out trying to learn how to do it.
And it was,

267
00:13:55.571 --> 00:13:58.330
it was kind of hard because there's not a lot of classes.

268
00:13:58.331 --> 00:14:00.970
You can't just go up to the local community college and take a class on

269
00:14:00.971 --> 00:14:03.970
storytelling.
There are,
at least in most places you can.
And if you do,

270
00:14:03.971 --> 00:14:06.070
it's certainly not in the business school,
right?

271
00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:07.960
It's in the creative arts department.
Or I could,
you know,

272
00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:11.920
but I don't want to learn to be a,
uh,
a fiction novelist.
I mean,

273
00:14:11.921 --> 00:14:14.980
that's not the kind of storytelling that I was interested in learning.

274
00:14:14.981 --> 00:14:18.160
I was interested in learning the two minute type of story,
you know?

275
00:14:18.161 --> 00:14:20.710
But that was nonfiction,
real stories.

276
00:14:20.711 --> 00:14:24.580
And so that's when I set out interviewing CEOs and leaders all over the world,

277
00:14:24.581 --> 00:14:26.500
just on my own personal learning journey.

278
00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:30.250
And that just ended up turning into a book.
I,
I guess I finally decided,
gosh,

279
00:14:30.251 --> 00:14:32.920
if I want to know this this badly,
probably other people do as well.

280
00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:35.920
And so it became a book idea as well.

281
00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:39.810
<v 2>Okay.
And so you wrote this book while you were working at Procter and gamble.</v>

282
00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:43.770
What was the point where you decided,
hey,
this is a popular book.

283
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.720
Maybe I should go out and do this full time?

284
00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:49.140
<v 0>Oh yeah.
Well,
so it kind of wasn't in that order.
I,</v>

285
00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:52.170
I didn't know for sure that I was going to leave,
make a career of it,
but I,

286
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:55.940
I did get fortunate and it,
uh,
it's allowed me to do that.
But yeah,

287
00:14:55.941 --> 00:14:59.330
there was this,
there was one moment where I really had to make a decision.
Right?

288
00:14:59.331 --> 00:15:00.141
Do I do,

289
00:15:00.141 --> 00:15:05.030
I keep working at my day job and I was 45 or 46 years old at the time,

290
00:15:05.031 --> 00:15:07.430
so too young for retirement and you know,

291
00:15:07.431 --> 00:15:09.620
I got kids to get through college and all that stuff.

292
00:15:09.621 --> 00:15:12.390
So it was a really tough decision.
And,
um,

293
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:15.680
and I actually ended up asking my father for advice,
you know,

294
00:15:15.681 --> 00:15:18.950
he's 80 years old at the time and I figured you're never too old to learn from

295
00:15:18.951 --> 00:15:22.700
somebody older and miser.
Um,
and,
and he's a hard of hearing,
so I,

296
00:15:22.701 --> 00:15:25.760
I can't call him on the phone anymore.
So I literally write him a letter and,

297
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.540
and uh,
he,
he writes back and I thought he was just going to give me advice.
Oh,

298
00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:33.530
absolutely.
It's on,
you should go pursue your dream or he was going to tell me,

299
00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:35.150
are you not surprised?
I mean,

300
00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:38.340
stick it out for five more years and retire and then go play around with the

301
00:15:38.341 --> 00:15:41.480
stuff.
And,
but he didn't do either of those things.
He,
he literally,

302
00:15:41.481 --> 00:15:45.920
I ironically told me a story about himself that I had never heard before and

303
00:15:45.921 --> 00:15:48.920
that none of my siblings had ever heard either.
And he said,
he said,

304
00:15:48.921 --> 00:15:52.250
when I was five years old,
I knew exactly what I wanted to do with my life.

305
00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:55.940
He said I wanted to be a singer,
you know,
like a Frank Sinatra,
Tony Bennett.

306
00:15:55.941 --> 00:15:59.480
I mean,
he's 80,
that's his genre,
right?
And,
uh,
uh,
he said,

307
00:15:59.481 --> 00:16:02.000
and I knew that the first day of kindergarten,
he said,
um,
you know,

308
00:16:02.001 --> 00:16:05.330
I get there and the teacher asks if any of us have any special talent,

309
00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:07.850
like dancing or magic tricks or whatever.
And he said,

310
00:16:07.851 --> 00:16:08.990
I raised my hand and I said,

311
00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:12.860
I can sing despite the fact that he'd never sung in front of anybody but his mom

312
00:16:12.861 --> 00:16:15.220
in the kitchen.
Right.
And so of course,
what do you think she,

313
00:16:15.221 --> 00:16:19.790
she does when he says that?
Oh,
of course,
Bobby,
stand up and sing us a song.

314
00:16:19.791 --> 00:16:22.640
So little five year old,
Bobby stands up and he says,
I belt it out.

315
00:16:22.641 --> 00:16:26.900
My favorite song right there acappella in front of everybody.
And he said,

316
00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:31.430
I nailed it.
I got all the words right in the melody and everything,

317
00:16:31.431 --> 00:16:33.500
and it was so proud.
And he said in the teacher,

318
00:16:33.501 --> 00:16:37.040
and the other students stood up and they applauded me like my first standing

319
00:16:37.041 --> 00:16:39.110
ovation my first time to ever sing a song.
And he said,

320
00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:42.470
that's the moment that I knew that this is what I was destined to do with my

321
00:16:42.471 --> 00:16:44.090
life.
And he said,
unfortunately,

322
00:16:44.091 --> 00:16:46.490
that turned out not just to be the first time in my life that I ever sang in

323
00:16:46.491 --> 00:16:47.324
front of an audience.

324
00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:50.480
It turned out to be the last time I ever sang in front of an audience.

325
00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:54.740
And he said,
the truth is,
son.
Um,
it wasn't just that life got in the way.
I just,

326
00:16:54.741 --> 00:16:58.790
I never had the courage to pursue it.
And he said,
that was 75 years ago,

327
00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:02.060
and there's not a month that goes by that I don't regret that decision.
He said,

328
00:17:02.061 --> 00:17:04.400
someday you're going to wake up,
you're going to be 80 years old like me.

329
00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.430
It's gonna be too late for you to pursue your dream.
You know?
And,

330
00:17:07.431 --> 00:17:11.120
and if that wasn't enough,
and it was,
by the way,
I thought it wasn't enough,

331
00:17:11.121 --> 00:17:14.000
I kid you not,
he,
he closed the,
the letter with these words.
He said,

332
00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:18.080
I'd love to see you achieve your dream,
but that doesn't mean in your lifetime,

333
00:17:18.081 --> 00:17:22.400
son,
that means in mine.
And I mean,
you know,
Tick Tock,
right?

334
00:17:22.401 --> 00:17:24.900
I mean these guys 80.
So yeah.

335
00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:28.310
So literally two days later I walked into my boss's office,

336
00:17:28.311 --> 00:17:32.870
Kirk Perry at Google walked into my boss's office and I resigned from my 20 year

337
00:17:32.871 --> 00:17:34.250
career to pursue this dream.

338
00:17:34.251 --> 00:17:36.990
And it's absolutely been the best decision ever made.
And I,

339
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.690
I probably would have made that decision eventually,

340
00:17:38.691 --> 00:17:41.180
but I wouldn't have made it on that day or that week or that month if it were

341
00:17:41.181 --> 00:17:42.560
not for that story from my dad.

342
00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:45.770
And you mentioned that that story also inspired your boss.

343
00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:49.130
I think it did.
You'll probably,
you need to have him on here and,

344
00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:52.520
and have that conversation as well.
But uh,
yeah,
you,
you may not have,
uh,

345
00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:55.020
have had the pleasure of him working here quite as soon.

346
00:17:55.021 --> 00:17:56.840
Maybe if it wasn't for that.
But we'll see.

347
00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:02.120
<v 2>Yeah.
You've interviewed people all over the world as you mentioned.</v>

348
00:18:02.121 --> 00:18:06.020
Are there cultures or types of people that are better storytellers than others

349
00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:07.480
naturally made?

350
00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:11.030
<v 0>Yeah.
So,
uh,
so two parts of that.
First of all,</v>

351
00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:13.220
definitely there are cultural differences in storytelling.

352
00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:17.600
And in some places people just do it a lot more.
And I think of,
uh,

353
00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:19.630
in Latin America,
uh,

354
00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:23.450
there's a lot more storytelling that just happens culturally then in eastern

355
00:18:23.451 --> 00:18:27.860
Europe and a or maybe an in western Europe and in Germany for example.
Um,
uh,

356
00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:28.770
so,

357
00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:33.770
so there are definitely places where it's more accepted and expected as part of,

358
00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:36.350
uh,
even in business interactions.

359
00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:41.650
But there's also definitely people who are naturally gifted storytellers and

360
00:18:41.751 --> 00:18:44.750
some people who are not.
And one of the things I learned as,

361
00:18:44.751 --> 00:18:48.230
as I interviewed these people all over the world,
I obviously I learned that.

362
00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:52.730
But what I also learned is that if you're not one of those people who's

363
00:18:52.731 --> 00:18:56.390
naturally good at it,
you can still learn it.
And that's in fact,

364
00:18:56.391 --> 00:18:59.480
one of the misconceptions that I've found a lot of people have is they think

365
00:18:59.481 --> 00:19:03.200
that some people are just born a natural storyteller or not.
And if they're not,

366
00:19:03.201 --> 00:19:07.520
they'll just never be.
Uh,
and I find it to be like,
um,
uh,

367
00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:11.840
like art or music.
Like some people are natural born musicians or artists.

368
00:19:11.841 --> 00:19:13.430
And by the way,
I'm neither of those things.

369
00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:16.040
But I bet if I wanted to learn to play the guitar,

370
00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:18.920
if I took lessons for six months,
I could probably learn.

371
00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:21.140
Now I'm never going to be fabulous,
but I could,

372
00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.880
I could probably stretch them out a few songs,
right?

373
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:26.070
But with storytelling people just,
but,
and most people know that they,

374
00:19:26.071 --> 00:19:28.610
most people know if I want really wanted to be an artist or musician,

375
00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.940
I could learn it a little bit.
But a lot of people assume a storytelling.
Oh No,

376
00:19:31.941 --> 00:19:34.860
I'm just,
I'm just not one of those people.
So tough for me.
No,
I,

377
00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:36.860
that's exactly why I write these books.
I mean,

378
00:19:36.861 --> 00:19:40.040
you can learn this just like you can learn any art.
Um,

379
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:42.620
but you can't just wing it.
You can't just say,
oh,
I'm just,
today,

380
00:19:42.621 --> 00:19:45.320
I'm going to be a good storyteller.
I'm just,
I'm just going to practice more.

381
00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:46.580
What does the same practice,

382
00:19:46.581 --> 00:19:49.510
you can't just practice playing the piano and I assume you're gonna get good.

383
00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:52.010
You need to learn from somebody who knows what they're doing.
Right?

384
00:19:52.011 --> 00:19:54.170
So read a book,
take a left,
take a class,
whatever.

385
00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:55.640
And that's the whole purpose of this.

386
00:19:55.641 --> 00:19:58.070
This is a learnable skill and you should learn it.

387
00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:02.490
<v 2>So to give us a preview of some of the techniques you teach in here,
um,</v>

388
00:20:02.491 --> 00:20:05.860
what are some of the ways you can learn to be a good storyteller?
Yeah,

389
00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:07.980
couple of frameworks.
Yeah.

390
00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:12.230
<v 0>So,
uh,
so first of all,
the structure of a story matters,
right?
Um,
and,</v>

391
00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:16.090
and all stories have some kind of a structure,
but,
and if you know what that is,

392
00:20:16.091 --> 00:20:16.660
you can,

393
00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:20.020
you can craft a better story and there are lots of different story structures

394
00:20:20.021 --> 00:20:22.080
you can use.
Um,
but,
uh,

395
00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:26.160
the kind of stories that you tell at work that you should be telling at work,
um,

396
00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:30.440
either for leadership purposes or sales purposes,
uh,
are short there.

397
00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:33.790
So I found that the average sale story is two minutes long.

398
00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:37.120
The average leadership story is four minutes long.
Okay.

399
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:41.440
I didn't say 10 or 15 or 20.
Right?
And so when people are telling 10 15,

400
00:20:41.441 --> 00:20:42.790
20 minute stories around the office,

401
00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:45.580
most people are yawning and rolling their eyes and checking their watch,
right?

402
00:20:45.581 --> 00:20:49.330
And looking for an exit strategy,
right?
So these are short to the point stories.

403
00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:54.670
Um,
so you don't have time for a 17 step story structure,
right?

404
00:20:54.671 --> 00:20:58.060
You need a short one.
So what I advocate in the book is just,
it's four steps.

405
00:20:58.061 --> 00:21:02.290
It's context,
challenge,
conflict and resolution,
right?

406
00:21:02.291 --> 00:21:04.390
So you introduce your main character.

407
00:21:04.391 --> 00:21:08.500
There are already into the very next part is what happened or what was the

408
00:21:08.501 --> 00:21:11.890
problem that they ran into or the opportunity that they ran into,

409
00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:15.040
what did they do about it?
And then how did it turn out in the end?

410
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:17.280
That's essentially,
in fact there,
there are eight questions that,

411
00:21:17.281 --> 00:21:21.220
that I say your story needs to answer these eight questions in this order,
right?

412
00:21:21.221 --> 00:21:24.010
And it starts with why should I listen to the story?
Right?

413
00:21:24.011 --> 00:21:25.600
Cause if you don't answer that question,
they might not.

414
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:28.330
I mean they could either mentally or emotionally or physically checkout.

415
00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:31.420
But then you get into the,
you know,
where and when did it happen?

416
00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:36.220
Who's the main character,
what did they want,
what was that problem they ran into?

417
00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:39.370
What did they do about it?
How did it turn out in the end?
You know,

418
00:21:39.371 --> 00:21:42.400
in the last couple of questions after the story is technically done is what did

419
00:21:42.401 --> 00:21:44.590
you learn from it and what do you think I should do now?

420
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:48.160
And if you can answer those eight questions in that order,

421
00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:51.070
you've got a pretty decent story on your hand.
Now.

422
00:21:51.071 --> 00:21:53.090
I think there are a lot of things you can add to that to make,

423
00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:57.690
take a good story and make it a great story like emotion that you mentioned.
Uh,

424
00:21:57.691 --> 00:22:01.240
the element of surprise is a really important one to even in business stories

425
00:22:01.241 --> 00:22:04.180
and leadership stories and um,
sales stories.
Um,

426
00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:08.050
adding a dialogue really makes it feel like a story instead of,
you know,

427
00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:11.050
somebody reading the tax manual to you.
And so there and,
and,

428
00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:15.920
and some level of details.
But not too much.
Uh,
I mean,
you,
you,
you,
uh,
if,

429
00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:19.480
if I were to tell,
start at a story with you by saying,
well,

430
00:22:19.481 --> 00:22:20.800
it was a warm September morning,

431
00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:25.320
right in the leaves were just turning color in the fall and that like already

432
00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:28.870
you're like,
are you serious?
Right?
I mean,
yeah,
I mean that's,

433
00:22:28.871 --> 00:22:31.050
that's like a 19th century romance novel,
right?

434
00:22:31.051 --> 00:22:33.700
And which is appropriate if you're reading in 19th century romance not,

435
00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.800
but if somebody is telling the story around the office that just,

436
00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:37.570
that's not an appropriate level of detail.

437
00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:40.030
That's a way too much detail and the wrong detail,

438
00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:42.090
like that's irrelevant to what's going on.
So,

439
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:45.490
so those are the kinds of things that you want the right kind of the hill in

440
00:22:45.491 --> 00:22:47.260
dialogue and emotion and surprise.

441
00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:49.870
So you combine all those kinds of things and there's a chapter essentially on

442
00:22:49.871 --> 00:22:53.050
each of those in the book to walk you through what the appropriate amount of

443
00:22:53.051 --> 00:22:53.884
that stuff is.

444
00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:58.620
<v 2>I remember in the book you said there's a difference between a journalistic</v>

445
00:22:58.621 --> 00:22:59.131
story,

446
00:22:59.131 --> 00:23:03.630
like a headline in a newspaper with the inverted pyramid and a business story.

447
00:23:03.631 --> 00:23:05.550
Can you tell us a little bit about that difference?

448
00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:08.340
<v 0>Yeah,
good question.
Yeah.
So that's one of those,
uh,</v>

449
00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:12.460
story structures that does not work because it's really not a story structure.

450
00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:15.280
It's an article structure.
Yeah.

451
00:23:15.281 --> 00:23:20.260
So journalists are often taught to start with the lead,
which is,
you know,

452
00:23:20.261 --> 00:23:24.400
uh,
uh,
four people killed in roadside bomb,
you know,
and wherever,

453
00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:29.350
and then all the details follow.
Right.
Um,
but in story telling,
you don't do that.

454
00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:34.450
You know,
you don't start out your story with,
uh,
uh,
and Romeo and Juliet died.

455
00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:39.630
Now let me tell you their story.
You've ruined,
right?
Yeah.
I mean,
the stories,

456
00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:43.510
stories are not newspaper articles.
I mean,
they're very different.

457
00:23:43.511 --> 00:23:46.490
And then people call a newspaper article,
newspaper stories sometimes,

458
00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.010
but they're there.
Again,
I think that that creates some confusion.

459
00:23:49.011 --> 00:23:50.600
So newspaper articles and,

460
00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:54.620
and really business memos or pattern of the same as newspaper articles with the

461
00:23:54.621 --> 00:23:55.490
inverted pyramid.
I mean,

462
00:23:55.491 --> 00:23:58.970
if you're going to write a memo around the office or an email,
you probably do,

463
00:23:58.971 --> 00:24:00.560
and you probably should start out,

464
00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:03.620
I recommend we do this and here are my reasons why.

465
00:24:03.621 --> 00:24:07.040
Here's the research I did and here are my conclusions and which all serves to

466
00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:10.430
promote and justify the recommendation you made at the very top.
Right.

467
00:24:10.431 --> 00:24:14.750
That's normal.
But that's not a story.
That's a memo.
That's an email.

468
00:24:14.751 --> 00:24:18.860
That's a recommendation.
A story is very different.
The story starts out context,

469
00:24:18.861 --> 00:24:21.560
action,
result,
surprise ending is at the end,

470
00:24:21.561 --> 00:24:24.560
the lesson that you learned is that the very end,
right?

471
00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:29.090
And you can use a story within the context of one of those memos or a speech or

472
00:24:29.091 --> 00:24:29.924
a presentation,

473
00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:34.750
but you would never start a story with and Luke Skywalker,
you know,

474
00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.560
as the son of Darth Vader handled,
let me tell you what happened to them.
Oh,

475
00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:40.840
you again,
you've ruined the whole story.
So different stories.

476
00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:45.700
<v 2>Okay.
So for someone that's not used to telling stories in a sales meeting,</v>

477
00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:47.860
how do you launch into that?
Do you say,

478
00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:51.610
I'd like to tell you a story or what's the best approach?

479
00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:55.400
<v 0>Yeah,
I'm glad you asked that yet.
Never do that.
And that's about it.</v>

480
00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:56.980
Like the worst thing you can do is,

481
00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:00.460
all right boys and girls gather around storytime right?
I mean that's if,

482
00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:03.790
if you're,
if you're selling to a bunch of kindergartners,
yes you can do that,

483
00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:07.690
but probably you're selling to grownups and grownups don't want to or need to be

484
00:25:07.691 --> 00:25:10.270
told that they're going to be told a story.
In fact,

485
00:25:10.271 --> 00:25:13.960
a lot of people have a negative visceral reaction to hearing that writing an in

486
00:25:13.961 --> 00:25:17.340
fact,
if,
if,
uh,
if we had started this meeting with you saying,
okay,

487
00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:18.520
well let's go and start this meeting.

488
00:25:18.521 --> 00:25:21.580
And I thought I'd kick it off by telling you a story.
I mean,

489
00:25:21.581 --> 00:25:23.170
immediately your audience is probably,

490
00:25:23.171 --> 00:25:25.210
their eyes are starting to roll in the back of their heads already,
right?

491
00:25:25.211 --> 00:25:27.580
I mean like,
because what they're imagining is you telling some long,

492
00:25:27.581 --> 00:25:30.880
boring 15 minute irrelevant story,
you know,
so what you,

493
00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:35.170
the way to start out is with what I call the hook and there's a whole chapter of

494
00:25:35.171 --> 00:25:36.640
the book just on how to,
how to craft that Hook.

495
00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:40.500
But it's literally only a half a sentence or maybe a sentence or two.
Um,
and,

496
00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:44.380
and so it's more like something like,
um,
you know,
that's a really tough problem.

497
00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:46.870
Let me tell you what I did last year when I ran into that problem.

498
00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:50.820
And now you're telling a story or,
God,
that's a tough question.
Uh,
you know,

499
00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:53.170
I think the best example of that I've ever seen was,

500
00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:55.300
and now you're telling a story now.

501
00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:59.350
So it's literally a one sentence lead in that tells the audience,

502
00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:02.110
I'm going to tell you something that's very important to you.

503
00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:06.310
So here and here and here goes as opposed to being told,

504
00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:07.630
I'm going to tell you a story.

505
00:26:07.631 --> 00:26:11.020
Just that word story is really never going to serve you well when you're telling

506
00:26:11.021 --> 00:26:11.854
a story.

507
00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:13.330
<v 2>Oh yeah.
Great Advice.</v>

508
00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:18.810
There's a particular story in this book that you share about a sales team that

509
00:26:19.031 --> 00:26:21.910
brings in their vice president and you know,

510
00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:26.620
he's damages the relationship to some extent.

511
00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:30.610
Could you share a little bit about that story with us or man retell it.

512
00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:35.490
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
So,
uh,
the,
uh,
what happened was this,</v>

513
00:26:35.491 --> 00:26:37.290
um,
a company had,

514
00:26:37.291 --> 00:26:42.180
was calling our retail a retailer and the manufacturer had raised their prices

515
00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.850
and it just,
it upset the retailer.
They were upset about the,

516
00:26:44.851 --> 00:26:48.880
the increase in prices.
And they wanted to essentially yell at somebody,
um,

517
00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:50.970
from headquarters,
somebody important,
right?

518
00:26:50.971 --> 00:26:54.570
So bring out one of your executives so that we can chew them out and tell them

519
00:26:54.571 --> 00:26:57.790
how unhappy you are with this price increase.
And so this guy,
um,

520
00:26:57.791 --> 00:27:00.690
who's fictitious name and the stories,
Bob Jacobson,
uh,

521
00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.880
it gets called out from headquarters to go on this,
uh,

522
00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:05.970
to this sales meeting and uh,
he's there.

523
00:27:05.971 --> 00:27:07.890
And then in the meetings going pretty well.

524
00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:10.920
There was some yelling and screaming and there was a lot of tension in the room,

525
00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:14.760
uh,
but when it was all over and did nicely and nobody,
you know,

526
00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:17.910
they didn't get kicked out of distribution and the relationship wasn't spoiled

527
00:27:17.911 --> 00:27:20.170
and everything,
it actually ended up pretty well.
Um,

528
00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:24.930
Bob pulls out his business card and hands it to the buyer,
the client and said,

529
00:27:24.931 --> 00:27:28.800
look,
a,
this relationship was really important to me.
Um,
so here's my card.

530
00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.510
Feel free to call me directly anytime.
You know,

531
00:27:30.511 --> 00:27:33.120
sometimes things can get lost in translation.
I just want you to know that,

532
00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:34.410
you know,
I'm here for you whenever.

533
00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:38.220
And then the other meeting's over and everybody went home and he of course

534
00:27:38.221 --> 00:27:42.480
thought he had done this great job and had saved the relationship with this

535
00:27:42.481 --> 00:27:46.620
client at the end is retailer.
Um,
and they,
they're debriefing with the rest.

536
00:27:46.621 --> 00:27:49.830
He's debriefing with the rest of the sales team after it's over.
And he said,

537
00:27:49.831 --> 00:27:50.940
well,
that went pretty well,
didn't it?

538
00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:55.650
And they looked at him like he was from Mars.
Like,
well,
yeah,
Bob.

539
00:27:55.651 --> 00:27:59.610
It was going great until the end where you handed Your Business Card to the

540
00:27:59.611 --> 00:28:02.730
buyer and basically told them that we were a bunch of idiots that couldn't even

541
00:28:02.731 --> 00:28:05.820
pass along a message to headquarters without something getting lost in

542
00:28:05.821 --> 00:28:08.730
translation.
Like you basically cost us,
you know,

543
00:28:08.731 --> 00:28:11.070
that that 10 seconds costs us six months of,

544
00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:13.230
of equity that we've had to develop with that client.

545
00:28:13.231 --> 00:28:15.450
They will take us another six months started back.
Right.

546
00:28:15.451 --> 00:28:17.880
And so just he thought he had done this wonderful job,

547
00:28:17.881 --> 00:28:20.990
but he'd really totally thrown the whole team under the bus and,

548
00:28:20.991 --> 00:28:24.930
and learned a valuable lesson and ended up losing his job over it.
Right.

549
00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:26.310
But he won't make that mistake again.

550
00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:32.340
<v 2>So tell us in your,
the trainings,
you do keynote presentations,
you do trainings,</v>

551
00:28:32.341 --> 00:28:35.520
what type of work do you do with the clients you work with?

552
00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:39.870
<v 0>Yeah,
yeah.
So,
so teaching them how to use storytelling betters,</v>

553
00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:41.820
I guess the obvious solution.
And by the way,
that,

554
00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:45.850
like that story that I just told you,
that story type number 25,
right?
It's,
it's,

555
00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:50.100
it's one of the types of stories that you would tell not to a buyer and not to

556
00:28:50.101 --> 00:28:52.320
yourself,
but to your peers.

557
00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:55.470
It's a type of story you would tell about that sales call you went on that went,

558
00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:58.680
that went great or went awfully so that they can learn from it.

559
00:28:58.681 --> 00:29:01.790
So that's just one of the types of storytelling.
Yeah.
So,
so typically,
I mean,

560
00:29:01.791 --> 00:29:04.680
I'll,
I'll do keynotes that could be in front of him,
you know,

561
00:29:04.681 --> 00:29:06.420
a large audience of a thousand people or something.

562
00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:12.290
But more typically I am with a small group of 15 to 30,
35 people,
uh,

563
00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:13.283
for a whole day.

564
00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:16.890
My teaching them the real nuts and bolts of how do you use storytelling?

565
00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:19.770
How do you craft stories for leadership purposes or sales purposes?

566
00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:21.680
And we walked through all of the,

567
00:29:21.681 --> 00:29:24.930
the components of the story structure and then the use of emotion and how to use

568
00:29:24.931 --> 00:29:26.470
the element of surprise and,
uh,

569
00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:30.210
the right dialogue in details and basically of modules and a,

570
00:29:30.211 --> 00:29:33.410
and a case study I think that I go through on each of these.
Um,

571
00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:35.790
and they'll often bring in their own stories as well and we'll,

572
00:29:35.791 --> 00:29:40.050
we'll work on those so they can see how they take what was an okay story or

573
00:29:40.051 --> 00:29:41.530
maybe not even a story at all.

574
00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.990
And we turn it into a great story by the end of the day.

575
00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.850
<v 2>Okay.
That sounds great.
Um,</v>

576
00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:50.300
do you see storytelling as becoming a more,

577
00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.700
a serious business topic,

578
00:29:52.701 --> 00:29:56.690
maybe being taught in business schools in the future or what is the situation

579
00:29:56.691 --> 00:29:57.524
with that now?

580
00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:00.010
<v 0>Yeah,
I hope so.
In fact,
I think it is.</v>

581
00:30:00.011 --> 00:30:02.500
So like when I was in business school 20 some odd years ago,

582
00:30:02.501 --> 00:30:05.020
it was definitely not.
But I've heard that there are a few,

583
00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:08.980
a handful of schools that are beginning to teach this.
I,
and in fact,
I know that,

584
00:30:08.981 --> 00:30:13.510
uh,
that one of my books is being used as a,
a taxed in several classes.

585
00:30:13.511 --> 00:30:16.660
Maybe not the only tax,
but so I know that's beginning to happen.

586
00:30:16.661 --> 00:30:21.450
So it's definitely a,
um,
a more seriously sought after skill now.

587
00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:22.470
<v 2>Yeah.
Great.</v>

588
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:23.303
<v 3>Hm.</v>

589
00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:27.880
<v 2>I think we're going to see if there's any questions from the group here.
Yeah,</v>

590
00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:28.510
yeah.

591
00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:32.820
Does anyone here have any questions for Paul about storytelling business stories

592
00:30:32.821 --> 00:30:36.490
though?
Well,
you mentioned,

593
00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:40.830
at least from your intro that you had these research teams for quite a number of

594
00:30:40.831 --> 00:30:43.770
years,
Huh?
Yup.
Putting it out that and those custom analysis,

595
00:30:43.771 --> 00:30:46.200
I imagine those are somewhat long stories now.

596
00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:48.720
There's not just necessarily one point to draw that.

597
00:30:48.721 --> 00:30:52.530
So can you tell us a little bit about how you saw that transition to this short

598
00:30:52.531 --> 00:30:55.650
two to four minutes detailed role that you've lived in?

599
00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:59.760
<v 0>Yeah,
so,
so the question is about,
uh,
uh,
research and analysis.</v>

600
00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:04.560
I had to turn that into,
into stories and so I,
if I could clarify a little bit.

601
00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:09.660
Um,
so I'm not suggesting that you take an entire analysis and turn it into one,

602
00:31:09.661 --> 00:31:10.560
two minute story.

603
00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:14.520
I'm suggesting that out of you may have a one hour presentation to present the

604
00:31:14.521 --> 00:31:18.240
results of your analysis.
We,
you should use all of that that you need.
Um,

605
00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:21.060
and you should two or three times within that hour,

606
00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:25.820
you should use a two or three minute story.
Um,
and so I'm not talking about,
uh,

607
00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:30.690
replacing an entire hour of a,
of analysis and presentation with,
with one story,

608
00:31:30.691 --> 00:31:34.500
but,
but illustrating it throughout with some of those.
Um,

609
00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:38.940
and I think if I could answer another question,
it's probably buried in there.
Is,

610
00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:41.820
is how do you tell a story with data?
Cause I,
I,

611
00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:45.390
it's probably a lot of the world that you traffic in is our numbers and I think

612
00:31:45.391 --> 00:31:49.140
you can tell stories with data as well.
So for example,
um,

613
00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:54.180
and at one point I had done an analysis of 40 years worth of sales and profit

614
00:31:54.571 --> 00:31:57.480
data,
uh,
in one of the P and g businesses that I was working on.

615
00:31:57.870 --> 00:32:02.870
And I found a very interesting correlation in that the first 20 some odd years

616
00:32:03.841 --> 00:32:07.650
of the state of there was a very strong correlation between sales and profit,

617
00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:10.800
but for the next 20 years there was no relationship whatsoever,

618
00:32:10.801 --> 00:32:13.080
no zero correlation between sales and profit,

619
00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:17.280
which led me to some very interesting conclusions and led me to a very specific

620
00:32:17.281 --> 00:32:18.630
recommendation that I wanted to make.

621
00:32:18.631 --> 00:32:21.630
And normally what I was taught to do is go in and tell them,

622
00:32:21.631 --> 00:32:25.230
I recommend that we do this and here's my reason why and here's the data that

623
00:32:25.231 --> 00:32:25.981
supports it.
By the way,

624
00:32:25.981 --> 00:32:28.890
here's the correlation chart that shows you know the data,

625
00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:32.430
but that's not what I did.
I went,
I used a a story.

626
00:32:32.431 --> 00:32:35.250
Essentially I use the data as a story.
I showed them the data,

627
00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:38.940
showed it on the first 20 years of correlation and then I showed them a second

628
00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:41.570
years and it was very clear that the relationship changed.

629
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:43.070
And then I just asked them,

630
00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:47.990
what do you think happened around 1983 that forever changed the relationship

631
00:32:47.991 --> 00:32:49.820
between sales and profits in this industry?

632
00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:53.420
And I let them struggle with that question and they started throwing out
answers.

633
00:32:53.421 --> 00:32:55.940
Well as that and when this happened or this happened or this happened,

634
00:32:55.941 --> 00:32:59.090
it was like good at answer but no good answer but no good Amster but no,

635
00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:03.260
somebody got it.
The same answer that I came up and I said,
yeah,
that's it.

636
00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:06.080
And then as soon as that happened,
it was like,
it was like magic.

637
00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:10.430
Everybody in the room just went,
oh.
And right after that,

638
00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:13.430
all of my conclusions started coming out of their mouths.

639
00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:16.820
And right after that my recommendations started coming out of their mouths.

640
00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:20.210
Like I literally never got to my recommendation slide and it was the best

641
00:33:20.211 --> 00:33:20.960
recommendation,

642
00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:25.490
the most quickly adhered to and agreed to recommendation that I ever didn't make

643
00:33:25.491 --> 00:33:30.410
at PNG.
Right?
Because take walking them through that as a story,

644
00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:32.920
like my,
and I call that now my,
uh,

645
00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:36.800
a discovery journey story where you walk the audience through the analysis that

646
00:33:36.801 --> 00:33:41.060
you did in the order that you did it up to the point that you had your big Aha

647
00:33:41.061 --> 00:33:41.750
moment,

648
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:46.750
but then stop and let them have the Aha moment because then it's their idea and

649
00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:50.180
you know that people are more passionate about pursuing their idea than they are

650
00:33:50.181 --> 00:33:51.710
about your idea.
Right?

651
00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:56.180
So using a discovery journey story with data that way turns your idea into their

652
00:33:56.181 --> 00:33:57.014
idea.

653
00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:58.640
<v 4>So what was the reason?</v>

654
00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:04.670
<v 0>Well,
uh,
the reason was because the market had matured,
so it was,
uh,
uh,
the,</v>

655
00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:08.220
the,
the business was a disposable diapers like pampers and loves.

656
00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:09.870
And when it was invented,

657
00:34:09.871 --> 00:34:14.520
of course it was replacing cloth diapers and it took about 20 years for people

658
00:34:14.521 --> 00:34:19.521
to stop using cloth diapers and pretty much all diapering households adopted

659
00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:20.400
disposable diapers.

660
00:34:20.401 --> 00:34:24.690
So once that 20 years had expired and nobody was using cloth diapers anymore,

661
00:34:24.691 --> 00:34:26.990
the market stopped growing and flatten down.
Gotcha.

662
00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:31.550
That point was that pivotal moment that strategy's trains change,
right?
The,

663
00:34:31.551 --> 00:34:33.350
the strategic,
uh,

664
00:34:33.390 --> 00:34:36.090
the strategies that we'll be successful in a developing market are very

665
00:34:36.091 --> 00:34:40.020
different than in a mature market.
And now we just had noticed that.
And so that,

666
00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:40.831
that's what made the difference.

667
00:34:40.831 --> 00:34:43.980
But I waited for somebody to figure that out and it didn't take long,

668
00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:45.360
two or three minutes,
but it was,

669
00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:49.410
that was such a well invested two or three minutes as opposed to me just giving

670
00:34:49.411 --> 00:34:51.570
them the answer because like I said,
then it became their idea.

671
00:34:53.430 --> 00:34:57.550
<v 4>Great.
The question,
yeah.
The minute that your,</v>

672
00:34:57.551 --> 00:35:00.350
your dad wrote you this letter and then you decide you're to make this

673
00:35:00.351 --> 00:35:03.380
transition,
how did you materialize?

674
00:35:03.381 --> 00:35:06.160
So you resigned and then did you just set out to be an author?

675
00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:10.400
Did you want to be a speaker?
How did your hopes PG developed?

676
00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:14.280
<v 0>Yeah,
so it,
it was a little bit intentional.
I mean,
I,</v>

677
00:35:14.281 --> 00:35:17.260
I knew that I wanted to be a speaker and trainer.
I just,
I,

678
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:20.210
I enjoyed that and I did a fair amount of that at p and g and I,

679
00:35:20.211 --> 00:35:22.120
I thought it would be great if I could do this full time.

680
00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:26.110
I didn't know that I would enjoy being an author and enjoy riding,

681
00:35:26.111 --> 00:35:29.200
but it turns out I did,
but I only found that out after I tried it.

682
00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:33.290
And so I thought,
well,
how cool is that?
I found two things that I love it.
Yes,

683
00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:36.400
yes.
So the ABS.
Correct.
Oh,
okay.
Well,

684
00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:39.300
but being a writer kind of goes along with that.
Well,
I mean,

685
00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:42.400
if I didn't do all this research and write books and nobody would know about me

686
00:35:42.401 --> 00:35:44.490
and I wouldn't have anything interesting to share.
Right.

687
00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:46.770
So it's kind of a strange business model where you,

688
00:35:46.771 --> 00:35:50.850
you go do research and write books and then people hire you a to go teach them

689
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:53.970
and train them about it.
Because look,
we don't have six weeks to read your book.

690
00:35:53.971 --> 00:35:55.830
I,
we want to know right now.
Right.

691
00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:58.860
So coming in and eight hours teach us all of this.
So yeah,

692
00:35:58.861 --> 00:36:00.700
I knew I wanted to do that.
Um,

693
00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:03.780
but I kind of had to wait and to see if there was some success with the first

694
00:36:03.781 --> 00:36:05.880
book because quite frankly,
like my dad said,

695
00:36:05.881 --> 00:36:08.370
I didn't have the courage to just quit and say,

696
00:36:08.371 --> 00:36:11.520
I'm going to write a book someday.
I kind of a,
I played it a little bit safe.

697
00:36:11.521 --> 00:36:14.130
I'll admit I wrote the book first and then kind of waited to see what happened.

698
00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:21.110
<v 2>Good.
Well that's all the questions we have for now.
I think we'll wrap it up.</v>

699
00:36:21.111 --> 00:36:23.840
Paul,
thank you so much for telling us about this book.

700
00:36:23.841 --> 00:36:27.830
