1
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.740
So very quickly.
My name is Sai.

2
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.620
And what I'm going to do today is that I'm going to run you all do a very small

3
00:00:13.621 --> 00:00:17.850
story,
uh,
not going to bore you all with the talk on disability,

4
00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:22.851
accessibility and inclusivity and all lag because not many people are affected

5
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.220
except the disabled people segment.
So,

6
00:00:26.221 --> 00:00:30.390
but I'll run you through a journey of my life and probably there'll be a few key

7
00:00:30.391 --> 00:00:34.320
takeaways and that's something that we could be interested.

8
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.270
And so to begin with,
uh,

9
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.150
it all started in 1984 when a couple in south India fell in love.

10
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.070
They got married and then I happened,
uh,
and when it happened,

11
00:00:47.071 --> 00:00:51.630
obviously I had this additional growth in spinal cord or the doctors did not

12
00:00:51.631 --> 00:00:56.631
know how to operate and things got messed up and there you go.

13
00:00:57.061 --> 00:00:58.200
I ended up with disability.

14
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.450
The fun part about that is that I never knew what being normal was.

15
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.720
So effectively for me to know what normal is,

16
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.610
isn't even there in my mindset.

17
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.800
But the aspect that I was born with a disability came in much later in life.

18
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.670
Uh,

19
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.260
I believe that there are new terms out here these days calling disabled people

20
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.010
as physically challenged or like,
you know,
uh,
differently.

21
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.540
Uh,
if you're calling a disabled person has physically challenged,

22
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.240
it's as if you're calling a single person romantically challenged.

23
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.840
It's actually not going to make any difference in that person's life whatsoever.

24
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.260
Uh,
some people also say disabilities a state of mind.

25
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.700
But imagine if I was in college and I'm looking at three floors and I have to

26
00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:44.900
climb all the three floors and someone says,
hey,
disabilities,

27
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.400
just to state of mind,
you can still claim the three floors.

28
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.440
I'm basically hitting nowhere at the end of today.
So under these circumstances,

29
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.800
my life took a drastic turn and this is what I'm going to run you through y'all.

30
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.280
So in 1984,
when I was born with this disability,
uh,

31
00:02:02.281 --> 00:02:04.680
it was very challenging for my father.
Uh,

32
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.550
my mom and dad didn't have much of a formal education.
Uh,

33
00:02:08.551 --> 00:02:12.930
so it became really difficult for them on how do they bring up a child like me.

34
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.430
Uh,
there was no terms like inclusivity,
accessibility back then.

35
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.110
And a lot of people believed that it was sheer bad Karma in previous life.
Uh,

36
00:02:22.111 --> 00:02:24.360
that,
you know,
they got blessed with a child like me,

37
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.240
but my dad did something really interesting at that particular point of time.
Uh,

38
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.270
unable to take the pressure that comes with having a child with disability.

39
00:02:33.271 --> 00:02:36.880
He decided that he will actually more of the state.
Uh,

40
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.430
he worked for Indian railways,

41
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.630
he applied for a transfer and we moved to Andhra Pradesh.

42
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.410
I says even more problematic because moving from Tamil Nadu to under this means

43
00:02:46.411 --> 00:02:51.411
my mom right now as a language barrier and she's with the scared and nobody

44
00:02:52.351 --> 00:02:56.460
knows how my life will turn out to be.
And uh,
it's,

45
00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.250
it's all pretty messed up by enough,
uh,
toward all lists.
Uh,
I,

46
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.850
we also belong to a typical lower middle class family.

47
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:08.680
So effectively a while physical disabilities,
one challenge,

48
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.430
uh,
lack of finances is a completely different ballgame altogether.

49
00:03:12.431 --> 00:03:17.080
So if I get a fever or if I go through something which would involve a medical

50
00:03:17.081 --> 00:03:19.420
procedure,
not only start emotional torture,

51
00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:21.850
but it is also going to be a financial challenge.

52
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.680
But across all these challenges.
Uh,

53
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.770
what kept me going was that I was not even aware of my disability because when

54
00:03:29.771 --> 00:03:33.100
you're at four or six years old,
you just don't know that you are a disabled.

55
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.490
You just want to go there,
play,
have fun and all that.

56
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.870
But the one thing that transformed my life was my dad's thought that the only

57
00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:44.560
way out of all the ills that are willing to come down to me because of my

58
00:03:44.561 --> 00:03:47.220
disability was through education.
Uh,

59
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.730
he strongly believed that education was going to bring me out of the challenges

60
00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:52.720
that I'm going to face.

61
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.560
And He tried to put me into schools when he put me into schools.

62
00:03:56.561 --> 00:03:59.140
The problem was not that I had a disability,

63
00:03:59.141 --> 00:04:02.650
the problem came from the parents of other children because they started to

64
00:04:02.651 --> 00:04:05.830
believe that if they get studies along with me,

65
00:04:05.831 --> 00:04:07.750
then they would mimic my habits are,

66
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.190
some of them went on to believe that some of the disability aspects that I have

67
00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.690
were probably contagious and therefore their children will end up suffering.

68
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.500
So they would politely go and tell the principal and college administrators that

69
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.760
they don't want me in the class.
The college principal will call over my parents.

70
00:04:24.761 --> 00:04:27.100
And like every year,
this used to be a routine.

71
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.260
So over eight years I had changed almost like seven to nine schools as a result

72
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.740
that I was never properly adapted to one place.

73
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.380
But the good part of it is like I had plenty of friends,

74
00:04:38.381 --> 00:04:40.390
or at least I thought I knew people.

75
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.400
So eventually I moved on to 10th class and I promised my dad that,
you know,

76
00:04:45.401 --> 00:04:49.120
that,
uh,
whatever happens,
uh,
in class 10th,

77
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.620
I will definitely get state first rank in the public entrance examination.

78
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.460
The fun part about that promise was that when the results came,
I got first,

79
00:04:57.461 --> 00:05:02.290
but from the bottom basically egg pass who shall live with one mark,
uh,

80
00:05:02.291 --> 00:05:06.910
I couldn't,
you know,
I basically scored 60% on my,
uh,

81
00:05:06.911 --> 00:05:10.090
overall 10th class examine when the results came on the computer screen.

82
00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.300
My Dad was shocked.
My mom started to cry,

83
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.410
my sister wanted to disown me and I was pretty much happy that I basically

84
00:05:17.411 --> 00:05:21.810
passed.
Uh,
so after that when I told my dad that,
you know,

85
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.930
I wanted to pursue ITG and all,
he just looked at me and said,
you know,

86
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.380
just pass 12th class.
Barely.
That's,
that's enough for us.
Okay.

87
00:05:29.381 --> 00:05:33.320
So I moved onto class 11th,
class 12th.
And uh,

88
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.960
the interesting aspect about those two years was that I,

89
00:05:37.961 --> 00:05:41.590
for the very first time saw that my parents were disappointed in me.

90
00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.230
Think of it like a lot of time for us Indians.

91
00:05:44.231 --> 00:05:46.810
The motivation comes from two reasons.
One out of passion.

92
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.660
The other reason is our parents are disappointed in us.

93
00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.700
It's like half the life for us goes off in proving to them that we are worth to

94
00:05:53.701 --> 00:05:55.030
their child.
Okay.

95
00:05:55.031 --> 00:05:58.430
So effectively my teachers were very happy after 10 ticklers deck,

96
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.760
this fellow human posture to the exam.
But my parents were disappointed.

97
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.950
For the very first time in life I felt that someone had expectations on me.

98
00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.160
And unlike,
you know,
expectations,
creating pressure,

99
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.370
I actually felt good because I was not this like hopeless case,

100
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.460
hopeless cases or two times.
One,
you don't have warp on yourself.

101
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:20.960
Number two others don't have hope on you.
So effectively I was like very,

102
00:06:20.961 --> 00:06:25.610
very happy that my parents were actually disappointed because they still had

103
00:06:25.611 --> 00:06:30.170
hope on me.
But somehow when he sat down to study,
nothing went into head,

104
00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:34.460
uh,
everyday to the college.
My mom would take me up on a cycle,
uh,

105
00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.260
in front of the entire colony.

106
00:06:36.261 --> 00:06:39.680
She would kind of like put me on the cycle and just drive me into college.

107
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:44.030
Then exactly at four o'clock she would be there then bring me up back to house.

108
00:06:44.031 --> 00:06:48.440
And like she did that for exactly 750 times,
like two ears.

109
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.270
And even then when I read physics,

110
00:06:50.271 --> 00:06:54.500
chemistry and nothing went into her head and I was cricket crazy.
Uh,

111
00:06:54.501 --> 00:06:58.370
that was the irony of life,
right?
God kind of gives you passion for something,

112
00:06:58.371 --> 00:07:00.200
but does it give you the talent for the same?

113
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.020
And that's where we want to plug the gap with effort.

114
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.640
So effectively as cricket crazy,
half the time I used to watch cricket matches,

115
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.340
ran one find days somewhere in 2001.

116
00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:14.610
There was this particular moment where my dad was threatening me that,
you know,

117
00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:18.140
I'll literally break the TV if you don't go and study right now.
And I told him,

118
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.770
Dad,
I promise you I will study,
uh,
let Rahul Dravid get out.

119
00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:27.120
And a I will study for sure.
And that was a fateful day because rabid,

120
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:28.580
rabid,
not only batter that day,

121
00:07:28.581 --> 00:07:31.670
but he bought it for three continuous days in that Kolkata test match.

122
00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.070
And he never got to study for those three days.

123
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:38.700
But as he kept batting and batting and batting,
I realized one thing,
he,

124
00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:41.990
he was a frustrating guy.
There's not an extremely talented guy.

125
00:07:41.991 --> 00:07:46.100
He was not the such of the team,
but he was a guy who would never get out.
I mean,

126
00:07:46.101 --> 00:07:50.030
when he gets out,
India is happy.
Just imagine that like when travel gets out,

127
00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:52.940
like people cheer because action is going to come down next.

128
00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.690
And if our own team is happy that is getting out okay,

129
00:07:56.691 --> 00:07:59.480
imagine what the opposition would feel.
So effectively,

130
00:07:59.481 --> 00:08:04.481
that particular moment I realized that maybe I might not be able to hang around

131
00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:07.310
and be talented.
Like searching in my subjects,

132
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:11.270
but I'll hang around and study and get frustrated with physics and chemistry and

133
00:08:11.271 --> 00:08:13.310
all those subjects like drive Edward.

134
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:18.490
So I started to study for the first time in life,
I kind of,
uh,

135
00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:22.790
let's say rectify some of the subjects and then kind of picked up the logic in

136
00:08:22.791 --> 00:08:26.510
mathematics.
And when the eventual results came,
uh,

137
00:08:26.511 --> 00:08:28.760
I secure 942nd rank in the state,

138
00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:32.480
in the state engineering entrance exam with state first in the physically

139
00:08:32.481 --> 00:08:33.560
handicapped category.

140
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:37.610
Now when I secure the state first rank in the physically handicapped category,

141
00:08:37.611 --> 00:08:40.970
my mom did marketing in the entire colony.
She was like,
you know,

142
00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:44.510
my son got state first mice and what state first mice and God state first.

143
00:08:44.511 --> 00:08:48.260
And like within about 15 minutes,
the entire colony new.

144
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.180
And I started to believe that every engineering college,
uh,

145
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:56.070
seat belongs to me because at the end of the day I had the reservation and they

146
00:08:56.071 --> 00:08:58.920
thought,
okay,
now my life is almost going to be set.

147
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:04.190
So when we eventually went to counseling,
this was the funny part,
fueled,

148
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.620
watched this movie called,
uh,

149
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:09.090
inception where Christopher Nolan comes up with this concept called dream.

150
00:09:09.091 --> 00:09:09.924
Within a dream.

151
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.960
Our government came up with this concept called the reservation within

152
00:09:12.961 --> 00:09:16.440
reservation long back.
Okay.
And I was not aware of it.

153
00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:19.860
So I will state first rank and physically handicapped category,

154
00:09:19.861 --> 00:09:23.310
but it was state first,
physically handicapped.
Oh,
see there is,

155
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:28.430
the reservation was split back then based on the principles of not only

156
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:33.420
physically handicap,
but also physically handicapped and again,
on the cost basis.

157
00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:37.380
So effectively the dream was to study whose money are university computer

158
00:09:37.381 --> 00:09:40.290
science.
The system put me in to see Vat College,

159
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.600
Aaa Electrical Engineering Department.

160
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:46.050
That change in college,
uh,

161
00:09:46.051 --> 00:09:49.190
introduced me to one great person because,
uh,

162
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.120
if you know where this colleges,
this is literally on site opportunities.

163
00:09:53.121 --> 00:09:55.080
So everyday you have to travel literally like 60,

164
00:09:55.081 --> 00:09:58.710
70 kilometers to even go to the college on the day.

165
00:09:58.711 --> 00:10:01.080
I took the seat in this college and went back home.

166
00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:05.490
I met the first villain of my life.
Now every bill,
every life has a villain.

167
00:10:05.491 --> 00:10:07.140
And I finally met a villain of my life.

168
00:10:07.141 --> 00:10:11.310
The villain of the life was the next door Auntie,
uh,
to my house.

169
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.070
The day I got back to the house.
Uh,

170
00:10:14.071 --> 00:10:18.630
she was there waiting for me and she was living on,
uh,
did you take the seat?

171
00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:23.190
And I was like,
yeah,
I took the seat.
And she was like,
you know,

172
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:26.460
which college?
And they said a CPAT and she was like,

173
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.210
very sick and they said it's there somewhere only in the city.

174
00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:34.380
And she started to rag me.
Uh,
she was like,
you know,
how will you go?

175
00:10:34.381 --> 00:10:38.340
Will you be able to climb the bus?
Would all these things work out for you?

176
00:10:38.341 --> 00:10:40.140
Why are you kind of like troubling people?

177
00:10:40.141 --> 00:10:44.510
Like there's and all that stuff in five minutes in this where there was no or

178
00:10:44.511 --> 00:10:48.930
could no Facebook,
no Twitter,
this anti followed my life.
Okay.

179
00:10:48.931 --> 00:10:53.190
And she kind of like kept an uptodate even off what are the events that are

180
00:10:53.191 --> 00:10:53.611
happening.

181
00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:57.630
So when she realized that my family was going to have a tough time with me

182
00:10:57.631 --> 00:11:01.770
getting educated in an engineering college daily,
she put a status on Facebook,

183
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.940
her community say this family's going to suffer for the next 40 years.

184
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.730
Then 1500 is commented on it,
30 aunty share it.

185
00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:14.100
And within no time in our colony we had become the family that was going to have

186
00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:17.480
a rough ride all over.
Uh,

187
00:11:17.481 --> 00:11:21.900
but those four years were rough.
Uh,
somehow I managed to graduate.

188
00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:22.920
Uh,

189
00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:27.920
I was one of the advantages of being a disabled person is that there is so much

190
00:11:28.531 --> 00:11:32.730
focus that you can put on only few events because there are only few events

191
00:11:32.731 --> 00:11:36.330
which you can focus on.
Uh,
so effectively,
uh,

192
00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:40.440
my mobility restriction in mobility allowed me to become a good reader.

193
00:11:40.441 --> 00:11:43.650
Over a period of time,
I started to focus on my education.

194
00:11:43.651 --> 00:11:48.060
My Dad had insisted that if at all I'm ever going to succeed in life,

195
00:11:48.061 --> 00:11:50.970
it is going to be,
is going to be through education only.

196
00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:56.270
And repeatedly that statement and advice kind of overtime molded me into a

197
00:11:57.491 --> 00:12:01.760
person who strongly started to believe in my dad's view.
Uh,

198
00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.900
I read this meme earlier today saying that when you repeat a lie enough number

199
00:12:04.901 --> 00:12:08.110
of times I end up loudly enough,
people will start to believe it.

200
00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.120
The same also holds could with truth.

201
00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:13.750
When you repeat a truth enough number of times and say it loudly enough,

202
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:17.350
people will start to believe it.
And that's what I started to believe as well.

203
00:12:17.351 --> 00:12:21.190
It started to believe that my education will kind of bring me out of all

204
00:12:21.191 --> 00:12:23.260
troubles.
So I worked hard,

205
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.910
graduated again as the top of the university at CBT.

206
00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:32.500
And,
uh,
in moment where I was getting placed,
uh,

207
00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:37.120
I got placed with Infosys.
And finally when he got placed with Infosys,

208
00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:40.360
Infosys asked me to move to my sore for training.

209
00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:45.580
Now here was a guy who for almost like 2022 years,
I lived with his family.

210
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:48.550
Every activity of his life was taken care of by his parents.

211
00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:52.950
So when they suddenly move to Infosys,
I experienced what freedom was like.
Uh,

212
00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:56.650
I was happy that Infosys was not a living parents into campus.
If they did,

213
00:12:56.651 --> 00:12:58.840
my parents would have stayed there as well.
Uh,

214
00:12:58.841 --> 00:13:02.060
so finally I got hold of a wheelchair.
I saw,

215
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:07.230
I lived there for four months and everything was going great until one fine day.

216
00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.310
I met the HR and uh,

217
00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:15.640
there was this particular conversation I had with him and he said,

218
00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:19.930
you know what side the postings have come out and you're going to get posted to

219
00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:20.803
[inaudible].

220
00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:24.620
Now that was a shocker for me because I was expecting posting in Hyderabad.

221
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.650
So effectively I told him,
sir,
I don't want posting to pony.
And then he said,

222
00:13:29.651 --> 00:13:31.840
uh,
you know why?
So I said,

223
00:13:31.841 --> 00:13:36.240
I have this disability and I can't take care of myself.
So you know what?
Ah,

224
00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:38.400
why don't you give me a posting?
I had river.

225
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:41.560
Then he looked at me straight on the face and he said,
you know what,

226
00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:46.180
if pony was Paris,
wouldn't you go?
And then I looked at him back and they said,

227
00:13:46.181 --> 00:13:50.120
but tonight is not Paris.
So effectively a,

228
00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:53.770
I much later realize that that's not how you talk to HR,
but you know,

229
00:13:53.771 --> 00:13:58.630
when you're young and like blood is flowing in you.
I thought we would talk.
Uh,

230
00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.450
then he looked back at me and he said,
you know,

231
00:14:01.451 --> 00:14:03.850
in a 30 years long corporate career,

232
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:09.100
a one or two years here and there are,
should not matter,
so go a.

233
00:14:09.101 --> 00:14:13.780
So I just couldn't take that,
that I had this huge ego back then believing that,

234
00:14:13.781 --> 00:14:14.530
you know,
uh,

235
00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:18.670
I was the top of my college and therefore I have a right to whatever posting

236
00:14:18.671 --> 00:14:19.390
that I want.

237
00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:23.650
Silly thoughts that go on in had seen an emotional moment in a very emotional

238
00:14:23.651 --> 00:14:28.630
moment.
I typed an email,
which was a resignation email and I clicked,

239
00:14:28.631 --> 00:14:33.520
could send the outlook and I had no idea back then off the consequences of it.

240
00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:35.380
The shocking part was that the HR,

241
00:14:35.381 --> 00:14:39.930
I actually accepted it and they go within four months of my comp,
uh,

242
00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.750
getting into Infosys,
I was out of the job.

243
00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:45.580
Now the biggest challenge was how do I tell this to my dad?

244
00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:47.530
Because here I was just finished their training.

245
00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:51.850
How do I go and tell my dad that?
You know what,
okay,
yeah.
Uh,
Hey da.

246
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:54.420
In that moment I needed ideas.

247
00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:56.810
So I looked at the inspiration of our entire country,

248
00:14:56.811 --> 00:15:01.680
which is [inaudible] now gone,
wrote a letter to his father.
Okay.

249
00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:04.940
Saying,
you know,
this is what happened in life and Gandhi's father forgive him.

250
00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:07.640
I thought the same approach will work for me also.

251
00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:11.330
So I wrote a nice letter telling my dad that,
you know,
stuff happened.

252
00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:16.310
So you know,
stuff must happen going forward.
So we have to do stuff in between.

253
00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:20.810
Uh,
and when he read the letter,
he didn't cry.

254
00:15:20.811 --> 00:15:25.280
He made the other person gray.
So effectively there was a big fight in house.

255
00:15:25.281 --> 00:15:29.750
Dad was calling mom when dad's calls mom,
mom cries,
my mom cry,
sister cries.

256
00:15:29.751 --> 00:15:32.870
When sister cries,
dad gets angry more.
This is called avalanche effect.

257
00:15:32.871 --> 00:15:36.290
Basically know,
and this is going on crazy back in life.

258
00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:41.240
And at one emotional moment I finally told my dad,
you know what?

259
00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:44.750
I have figured this out.
Uh,
when I lived in Infosys,

260
00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:47.700
I could survive there for four months because,
uh,

261
00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:52.400
the wheelchair was accessible the very first time I used the word accessible in

262
00:15:52.401 --> 00:15:56.360
life.
Uh,
literally took me 23 years to tell my dad that,
you know,

263
00:15:56.361 --> 00:15:58.330
that place was accessible.
I survived there.

264
00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:03.440
I think I will go abroad and study the movement.
I said that dad laughed.

265
00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:07.880
And then he said,
dad,
I'm serious.
And then he got serious.
So I said,
I laughed.

266
00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:12.860
Okay.
You know what?
I was just kidding around,
but that's just an idea.

267
00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:14.540
So on one other finding,

268
00:16:14.541 --> 00:16:17.690
I went to this kitchen where my mom was cooking and he said,
Ma,

269
00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:20.660
do we think going abroad and studying would be a good idea?

270
00:16:20.661 --> 00:16:23.870
And she got emotional and she was like,
you know,
would you leave me and go,

271
00:16:23.871 --> 00:16:26.300
can you survive and all that.
Why is life like this?

272
00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:30.200
I think Shani period is running for you and all that stuff.
So she was like,

273
00:16:30.201 --> 00:16:32.420
let's go and meet an astrologer.
And I'm sorry,

274
00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.400
where is that coming into picture right now?

275
00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:37.670
So I really had no clue what to do back then.
Uh,

276
00:16:37.671 --> 00:16:42.410
so it started with a step by step approach.
I told my dad that,
you know what,
uh,

277
00:16:42.411 --> 00:16:46.120
I'll search for a new job but one condition,
uh,
let,

278
00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:48.050
let me just write the GRE exam.

279
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:51.230
Let's just have as a that as a backup option and see.

280
00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:52.970
So effectively my dad agreed.

281
00:16:52.971 --> 00:16:57.971
I started to take the GRE exam and then once the GRE exam got cured,

282
00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:02.360
uh,
and I scored really well on that and I went to my dad and said,
you know what?

283
00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:06.350
A lot of my friends who went abroad are doing well.

284
00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:08.060
It is not that I want to go,

285
00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:12.020
it's just that I want to admit so that I can tell people it was my choice not to

286
00:17:12.021 --> 00:17:12.470
go.

287
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:15.980
Because right now even I tell people that I did not go there thinking that who

288
00:17:15.981 --> 00:17:19.490
even gave you that meat first to go and all that stuff.
Then he said,
okay.

289
00:17:19.491 --> 00:17:21.230
I applied to about three universities.

290
00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:25.760
So I applied to three universities in all Stanford,
Wisconsin,
Madison,

291
00:17:25.761 --> 00:17:27.140
Texas a and m college station.

292
00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.200
All the three universities give the admin back then.

293
00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:35.480
And I was like shell shocked.
And because how the hell did they admit me?

294
00:17:35.481 --> 00:17:38.810
I thought the Iq of the school for,
and we are almost like 10 points the day.

295
00:17:38.811 --> 00:17:43.550
I got to admit.
Uh,
but when I saw the admit,
I was like really happy.

296
00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:47.750
So I went to my dad and he said,
now the ultimate talk had to happen.

297
00:17:47.751 --> 00:17:52.380
So I told him like,
we come this far,
can we make the leap going forward?

298
00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:56.010
So when you look back,
when I look back at that moment,

299
00:17:56.310 --> 00:18:01.310
I felt that that was a transitional point because large ideas when you tell

300
00:18:02.101 --> 00:18:06.750
people it'll be extremely stupid are,
to give you a kind of a context to this,

301
00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.510
this was back in the freshest party in our college.

302
00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:11.700
There are two kinds of fridges party in our college.

303
00:18:11.701 --> 00:18:15.120
One was the management freshers and the actual Frisch's party management

304
00:18:15.121 --> 00:18:18.810
research is like where they give one sprite ones most are unsafe or how great

305
00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:20.180
the colleges,
uh,

306
00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:24.420
the actual Frechette is where the seniors invited all the juniors and there were

307
00:18:24.421 --> 00:18:26.670
three rounds to that,
uh,
Fresher's party.

308
00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:29.250
The first round was the introduction round.

309
00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:31.790
The second round was the proposal round.

310
00:18:31.791 --> 00:18:36.420
The third round was the dance rounder to make it into the dance around what we

311
00:18:36.421 --> 00:18:38.900
had to do was give a very good introduction of ourselves.

312
00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:43.080
And in the proposal around every guy had to propose to a girl with the rules and

313
00:18:43.081 --> 00:18:46.080
she had to kind of accept it.
And only if she accepts,

314
00:18:46.081 --> 00:18:49.260
we make it into the dance floor.
When the rules were announced,

315
00:18:49.261 --> 00:18:52.970
me and my friend were shell shocked because we knew that we were a certified

316
00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:56.970
item boys of the class.
And if we take a ozone,
get onstage and call female up,

317
00:18:56.971 --> 00:19:00.900
she'll be like,
did this fellow just seriously think that you know,

318
00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:04.820
I am the one for him on all that stuff.
So effectively,
uh,

319
00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:07.710
as me and my friend sat down and wondered,
what the Hell should we do?

320
00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:12.630
My friends started to laugh and I was like,
what happened?
And then he said idea.

321
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:15.930
And whenever friends his idea do not trust.

322
00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:19.980
But at that point I was naive,
so effected,
looked at him and I asked him,

323
00:19:19.981 --> 00:19:23.400
you know,
what's the idea?
Then he said,
uh,
you know what side,

324
00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:28.530
go and propose to the most beautiful girl in the class.
And I was like,
you know,

325
00:19:28.531 --> 00:19:31.470
are you crazy?
And he was like,
yeah,
trust me.

326
00:19:31.471 --> 00:19:34.200
Go and propose to the most beautiful girl in the class.
And it's like,

327
00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:36.900
what's the point of that will reject.
And then he said,

328
00:19:36.901 --> 00:19:40.980
that's the point when you have to take a risk,
take a maximum risk.
Okay.

329
00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:44.790
When you take a risk,
take a maximum risk.
If it works out,
that's it.

330
00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:47.460
You can do festival.
But if it doesn't work out,

331
00:19:47.461 --> 00:19:49.860
nobody even expected it to work out.
Okay?

332
00:19:49.861 --> 00:19:54.510
So everybody will say that the girl was proud.
So the idea looked good.
Okay.

333
00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:59.300
But I also had to take a rose and convinced the female out.
So I took her,
rose,

334
00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:02.250
went to her and instead,
you know,
press a number sooner,

335
00:20:02.251 --> 00:20:06.270
he yoga and all that stuff and they didn't work out.

336
00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:10.710
But much later when I was sitting down with my dad,
I told him,
you know what,

337
00:20:10.711 --> 00:20:14.730
that we are taking a risk.
But if it works,
great,

338
00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:18.840
it doesn't work.
At least I'll become a lecturer.
So in here taking a risk,

339
00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:23.490
let's take maximum risk.
Uh,
finally he said,
okay,
uh,

340
00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:27.540
let's take this.
The moment he made the decision to support me,
right?

341
00:20:27.541 --> 00:20:31.650
That was the point where I also thanked him and they said there was a point in

342
00:20:31.651 --> 00:20:34.500
life where he was convincing me that I should get educated.

343
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:38.580
Here was a point in life where I was trying to convince him back saying I need

344
00:20:38.581 --> 00:20:41.110
education for myself.
And then he said,
t care,

345
00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:43.140
all this sentimental dialogues are good,

346
00:20:43.141 --> 00:20:47.010
but figured out how we're going to take care of the finances.
But on that day,

347
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:51.670
he got convinced on,
he started to tell relatives and other people that,
you know,

348
00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:56.380
we have decided to send us and abroad was their day madness began.
Uh,

349
00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:59.710
because people were like,
you know,
uh,
are you crazy?

350
00:20:59.711 --> 00:21:01.690
How would you be able to send your son abroad?

351
00:21:01.691 --> 00:21:03.550
He cannot even claim a bus in the city.

352
00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.460
How do you think he's going to live abroad?
And all that stuff.

353
00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:10.720
My mom started to become emotionally very weak so I made her sat next to youtube

354
00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:15.160
or watch videos shorter how us is accessible and you know,

355
00:21:15.161 --> 00:21:18.600
much more friendly to people here,
there and you know,

356
00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:22.570
try to do a lot of convincing but didn't work out.

357
00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:26.320
That was also the point where a lot of people actually questioned me.

358
00:21:26.321 --> 00:21:28.870
This started throwing Sanskrit conditions like you know,

359
00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:33.280
a financial we burrito buggy.
Okay.
They started to say things like,
you know,

360
00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:36.040
because your time is barrier.
Getting thoughts like this.

361
00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.970
Some other people were like,
you know,
you had a wonderful job within forces.

362
00:21:38.971 --> 00:21:41.500
Why could that are in trouble?
Your parents.

363
00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:44.290
Some people even went to an extreme extent.
They were like,
you know,

364
00:21:44.291 --> 00:21:47.530
your sister won't get married if you're doing all this crazy stuff.

365
00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:50.890
And yet at that moment I was really,

366
00:21:50.891 --> 00:21:55.030
really focused on the education and there was this big problem on how do we

367
00:21:55.031 --> 00:21:58.600
generate the finances to study so if he can make crazy friend.

368
00:21:58.601 --> 00:22:00.820
We started to roam around all the NGOs.

369
00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:04.840
We kind of showed them our offer letter and we kind of said,
you know what?

370
00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:08.290
I have this admit from Stanford and Wisconsin,

371
00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.980
if you can go ahead and sponsor us,
uh,
at least,
you know,

372
00:22:11.981 --> 00:22:14.140
for the first semester it would be really helpful.

373
00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:17.380
We roamed around every NGO in the city or the end of the day.

374
00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:20.560
The only one thing that we got was the petrol bill for the school team.

375
00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:24.970
So effectively nothing worked out.
And then I was really depressed.

376
00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:27.850
I was fighting or whom every day.
And then one fine day,

377
00:22:27.851 --> 00:22:31.540
my friend called and he said the idea,
and I was like,
okay,

378
00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:35.910
what is your idea?
And he said,
you know,
let's approach the media.
Uh,

379
00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:40.360
so as if that was not enough,
we approached the media,
uh,
none of the,

380
00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:42.580
we couldn't even get through the security gate.

381
00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:46.600
So we stood outside the security guard for,
of the Hindu newspaper.
One fine day.

382
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:49.600
I,
we started standing outside from like 11 o'clock in the morning,

383
00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:54.310
roughly around three o'clock.
One guy came out and,
uh,
he was,
as he came out,

384
00:22:54.311 --> 00:22:57.850
we said,
sir,
I have an Admin at this particular university.
Uh,

385
00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:02.470
so would you like to write an article about a us?
About me.
And then he was like,

386
00:23:02.471 --> 00:23:06.820
you know,
which university did you get an add button?
And then I said,
you know,

387
00:23:06.821 --> 00:23:08.530
I got to admit,
and Wisconsin and Stanford,

388
00:23:08.531 --> 00:23:11.320
would you go ahead and write the article?
Then he said,

389
00:23:11.321 --> 00:23:14.140
everybody gets an admit for MSD is just what's the big deal?

390
00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.980
Then my friend had enough presence of mind researcher,

391
00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:20.500
but these guys handicapped.
So this was like at that moment of big moment.

392
00:23:20.501 --> 00:23:23.200
So we were like literally selling over a disability for an article.

393
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:26.560
And then that guy was shocked and he was like,
are you really disabled?

394
00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:30.040
And I was like,
you know,
do you want me to walk and show right now?
And uh,

395
00:23:30.041 --> 00:23:34.870
effectively he took an,
I took the interview and next day morning,

396
00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:36.250
even as I was waking up,

397
00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:41.460
there was a huge noise outside the house and inside the house vessels were

398
00:23:41.561 --> 00:23:44.170
flying.
And I was like,
what the heck just happened?

399
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:48.830
So as woke up and was wondering what actually happened,
I looked at it.

400
00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:53.650
My Dad gave me the newspaper,
The Hindu newspaper front page below portion.

401
00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:56.800
There was this beautiful article called physically handicapped.

402
00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:00.500
It mentally tough,
uh,
with my photograph in it.
Now,

403
00:24:00.501 --> 00:24:01.940
that was not the problem.

404
00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:06.380
The problem was the article could tell that my dad's salary and it said,

405
00:24:06.381 --> 00:24:06.740
you know,

406
00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:10.030
this person's salary is this much and therefore he is not able to kind of,
uh,

407
00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:14.150
progress.
Therefore,
if any kind hearted soul is there,
please sponsor.

408
00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:17.110
That was also not the problem.
The problem was old.

409
00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:19.600
The villain rented this newspaper and uh,

410
00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:23.330
effectively she asked my mother early in the morning is easier,

411
00:24:23.331 --> 00:24:26.270
has been salary this much only,
and this was an ego hurt.

412
00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:31.390
So effectively it was a huge fight going on in house and effectively all over

413
00:24:32.541 --> 00:24:35.220
again our lunch effect.
Uh,
because my dad was like,

414
00:24:35.221 --> 00:24:36.650
when did you even give this article to you?

415
00:24:36.651 --> 00:24:40.670
And I have an idea what happens if you kind of like pitch to the media and stuff

416
00:24:40.671 --> 00:24:41.800
like that.
Uh,

417
00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:45.530
the TV remote to broke because I threw it on the floor in anger and all that

418
00:24:45.531 --> 00:24:49.370
stuff.
Literally,
I started to feel guilty at one point.

419
00:24:49.371 --> 00:24:53.040
I just wanted to get the hell out of the country.
Finally,
uh,

420
00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:56.420
we started an entrepreneurial venture and we kind of made some money.

421
00:24:56.690 --> 00:25:01.690
I generated some money to kind of a cover for the first semester expenses and,

422
00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:06.260
uh,
started to go to the US and started pursuing my education abroad.

423
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:09.170
Uh,
in the first year at Wisconsin.

424
00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:13.610
I took up this content because it was much lesser expensive and they offered me

425
00:25:13.611 --> 00:25:14.690
the computer science course.

426
00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:19.320
So effectively when it started my course on the very first day,
uh,

427
00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:23.350
September 19th,
2007,
the day I landed in Chicago,

428
00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:26.240
fantastic event happened.
Lehman brothers collapsed.

429
00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:30.520
So the world went into recession.
So effectively [inaudible] that we didn't,

430
00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:33.020
any period together happened so effectively.

431
00:25:33.021 --> 00:25:35.450
I just didn't know how that will impact my life.

432
00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:39.740
What happened was the dollar value went up by four piece and that means the fee

433
00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:44.750
increased like crazy.
And on top of that,
uh,
I thought,

434
00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:49.790
uh,
the US is what we see in a MTV or anything like that.

435
00:25:49.791 --> 00:25:52.670
But I chose a place where it's news.

436
00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:56.900
I thought I would choose that place because no is cool.
Uh,
then he realized,

437
00:25:56.901 --> 00:26:00.170
first snow is cold.
Second problem was I taught,
you know,

438
00:26:00.171 --> 00:26:04.340
when there is a lot of snow,
everybody faces difficulty to more around.

439
00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:07.130
I by default face difficulty to more around.

440
00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:09.890
So it did kind of get nullified much later.

441
00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:12.410
I realized that everybody has a way around it.

442
00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:16.970
I don't because when I use my manual wheelchair on the Snowfield area,

443
00:26:16.971 --> 00:26:19.010
it's going to become literally crazy.

444
00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:22.670
So in one fine day got caught up in snow,

445
00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:24.770
I collapsed because of hypothermia.

446
00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:28.760
And then when I woke up it was literally two days later in the hospital along

447
00:26:28.761 --> 00:26:33.290
with the $15,000 bill and I was probably at the lowest point in my life.

448
00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:37.220
Looking back,
I don't know what kind of kept me going then.

449
00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:41.360
I would just say that at that particular point of time,
a sick and tired of life,

450
00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:46.620
uh,
there was,
uh,
there is a point in life where no matter how hard you try,

451
00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:50.790
everything falls apart at that moment.
Some people break forever,

452
00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:54.930
some people become number,
they become like joker.
Okay.
They'll be like,
you know,

453
00:26:54.931 --> 00:26:56.430
I want to do something chaotic.

454
00:26:56.730 --> 00:27:01.290
And I just decided to continue my education at that particular point.

455
00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:04.650
A over a period of time,
scholarship opportunities opened up.

456
00:27:04.651 --> 00:27:08.430
I cracked through the scholarship and somehow graduated again top of the class

457
00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:09.870
in Wisconsin,
Madison.

458
00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:15.500
Now here was the interesting aspect when I went through all the struggle and I

459
00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:18.210
could graduate top of the class,

460
00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:22.860
I wanted to make a fantastic video showing people that,
you know,
uh,

461
00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:27.570
any person can overcome the odds and they need not struggle so much and so much

462
00:27:27.571 --> 00:27:29.880
of perception hurt should not have happened.

463
00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:34.380
So I made this fantastic video in which I showed what are the facilities

464
00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:37.460
available for people with disabilities in the US,

465
00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:41.610
how education system there is different from the education system here.

466
00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:42.450
How I showed,

467
00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:46.410
I showed how accessibility is important and not reservation because in our

468
00:27:46.411 --> 00:27:48.780
country reservation is provided for people with disabilities.

469
00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:52.650
Reservation people with disabilities is like telling,
you know what,
uh,

470
00:27:52.651 --> 00:27:55.590
we give you 3% reservation.
Uh,

471
00:27:55.620 --> 00:28:00.140
which means that if there is a college and the college has tears,
uh,

472
00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:03.240
and you're facing a challenge to climb those stairs,

473
00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:06.510
well climb the stairs no matter what.
But if you get low marks,

474
00:28:06.511 --> 00:28:08.160
I'll still kind of give you the,
I'd met,

475
00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.700
it just does not make sense that you saw all the disability problem with

476
00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:14.610
reservation.
You need to solve their disability problem with accessibility.

477
00:28:14.611 --> 00:28:18.210
So I made a fantastic video explaining this and put it on Youtube.

478
00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:23.430
Two people watched it.
Me,
my friend.
Okay.
My friend gave up half way.

479
00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:27.780
So effectively I was like,
okay,
what the hell just happened?

480
00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:32.910
And I tried to promote that video as much as possible and nothing worked out.

481
00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:38.250
So on that fateful day I was a little low and when I was going back on,

482
00:28:38.251 --> 00:28:41.970
my mother's birthday was coming up and then your mom's birthday was coming up.

483
00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:44.580
I'd never missed celebrating her birthday at any time.

484
00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:47.280
So this time we wanted to celebrate in a very big way.

485
00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:52.500
And since it was just about to graduate,
I decided,
I saw this ad for skydiving.

486
00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:55.700
So when me and my friend was there where they're standing next to each other,

487
00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:59.280
my friend said idea.
And I was like,
okay,
what's your idea?
And he said,
you know,

488
00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:04.440
you know what?
Get on top of the plane,
let's take the flight to 14,000 feet,

489
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:08.010
jump out of the flight and then we share mom happy birthday and turned off the

490
00:29:08.011 --> 00:29:11.320
whole world.
So the idea looked good.
Uh,

491
00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:16.140
in an emotional moment.
I paid okay on top of the flight.

492
00:29:16.141 --> 00:29:19.500
When I wanted to jump,
I jumped at it because I paid,
uh,

493
00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:22.400
primarily because if I hadn't jumped into the air and my daddy came to know it,

494
00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:23.310
he would have pushed me.

495
00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:26.280
He's like into a call for the flight back and said like jump all over again.

496
00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:28.380
When I was in the mid air,

497
00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:33.450
I had forgotten that it was my mom's birthday because I had to get down because

498
00:29:33.451 --> 00:29:35.790
my mom's birthday would have been probably my day to day.

499
00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:41.120
And also realize that normally when people skydive and they get land the land on

500
00:29:41.681 --> 00:29:44.080
their feet and walk.
Whereas with me,

501
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:46.540
the legs were retired because I cannot learn.

502
00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:49.000
And before learning and I had to bend down,

503
00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:52.030
pull the legs upwards and land on me back.

504
00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:55.030
And we had no idea how this was going to work out.

505
00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:58.360
But that's what you do when your emotional,
stupid and younger.

506
00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:03.670
And finally when we kind of took the risk,
came down and landed,

507
00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:09.060
my friend had enough common sense to put an Indian flag in my hand and together

508
00:30:09.731 --> 00:30:13.450
both of us creamer that this is for the cause of people with disabilities in

509
00:30:13.451 --> 00:30:18.220
India.
That video went viral and people were like,
you know,

510
00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:21.490
disability skydiver,
disable.
The guys carried out some people who are like,

511
00:30:21.491 --> 00:30:23.350
you are my inspiration and all that.

512
00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:28.380
There was this actual video where it talks sense and there was another video

513
00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:31.600
which had no relation whatsoever with disability.

514
00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:36.160
It was just a what a guy jumping from a plane and when he skydived people were

515
00:30:36.161 --> 00:30:38.880
like,
you know,
they were caught.
Uh,

516
00:30:38.881 --> 00:30:43.660
and the attention was there and that's when I actually understood that in India

517
00:30:43.661 --> 00:30:48.220
the messaging needs to be a little different.
So that was the first point.

518
00:30:48.221 --> 00:30:51.910
I started to think maybe we shouldn't preach people about people,

519
00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:55.600
about accessibility.
We should probably try it from a different angle.

520
00:30:55.960 --> 00:31:00.370
So I started with analyzing the root cause to try and find out why is there a

521
00:31:00.371 --> 00:31:04.240
stigma associated with the word disability and that took me to religious

522
00:31:04.241 --> 00:31:05.470
textbooks.
I,

523
00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:09.190
the first book that I read was this Bhagavad Gita book where I read the word

524
00:31:09.191 --> 00:31:10.750
called Karma.
People said,

525
00:31:10.751 --> 00:31:14.380
you know you experienced disability because you did bad Karma in previous life.

526
00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:16.840
And imagine like as a disabled person you are reading this.

527
00:31:16.841 --> 00:31:21.100
This is Lord Krishna telling you on your face do last Gemma,
you'd reach tough.

528
00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:25.210
This Jerma you are going to experience stuff that hurt.
But so I was,

529
00:31:25.211 --> 00:31:29.560
as I was reading that book further,
I also started to read in that book died.

530
00:31:29.561 --> 00:31:34.060
He said life is composed of five elements,
sky,
earth,
water,
fire,
air.

531
00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:39.010
And he then adds only a person who has like a straight vertical spinal cord can

532
00:31:39.011 --> 00:31:42.400
experience all these five elements to totality.
And it was like,
okay,

533
00:31:42.401 --> 00:31:47.401
this is where I catch you because if that is what you want and that you tell

534
00:31:47.531 --> 00:31:51.460
that only a person would complete straight spinal cord,
they can experience this.

535
00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:53.800
Let me prove to you that that's not true.

536
00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:56.440
So it came up with this elaborate plan that for sky,

537
00:31:56.441 --> 00:31:59.770
we started with skydiving for earth.

538
00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:03.700
I went to the Grand Canyon,
we kind of rented a helicopter,
uh,

539
00:32:03.701 --> 00:32:06.400
went inside the Grand Canyon,
stayed there for a week.

540
00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:09.250
And what happened because of that,
nothing,

541
00:32:09.251 --> 00:32:12.580
just my manager got upset because I was not available for a week.

542
00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:16.930
So effectively it was not hitting in any direction.
Then came water.

543
00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:21.040
The water was the big challenge because I wanted to lose scuba diving.

544
00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:23.860
But my friend advised me saying that,
you know what to what avenues,

545
00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:28.750
what honeymoon couples do think big.
And then I asked him,
okay,

546
00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:30.370
what do we mean think WIC?

547
00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:34.390
Then he said like there is a place on earth where the Pacific Ocean and the

548
00:32:34.391 --> 00:32:38.410
Atlantic Ocean intersect wanting to take a jump there.
And I was like,
you know,

549
00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:42.260
there is a dream that is fantasy,
there is stupidity.

550
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:44.300
And then there is a zone behind that.

551
00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:48.500
Why do you ever think I'll get into that zone?
Then he said,
no.
So let's try out.

552
00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:52.310
And so I started to look out for people who would go,

553
00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:55.910
who had done that probably previously.
Then I met this guy,

554
00:32:57.110 --> 00:33:02.110
he was the first man to walk the North Pole and South Pole back in the 1980s

555
00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:04.100
when I asked him over email,

556
00:33:04.101 --> 00:33:08.210
why did you walk to North Pole and South Pole in the 1980s?
Is that too?
He said,

557
00:33:08.211 --> 00:33:11.480
just because it's there.
Okay,
so effectively.

558
00:33:11.481 --> 00:33:15.290
Then I realized there are crazy people on the planet.
Then they asked him,

559
00:33:15.291 --> 00:33:19.130
you know,
uh,
don't you think that's a little stupid thing to do?

560
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:22.280
Then he wrote me an elaborate email.
He said,
you know,

561
00:33:22.281 --> 00:33:26.750
outside when I first walk to South Pole and then came back to my native country,

562
00:33:26.751 --> 00:33:28.280
England,
uh,
people,

563
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:32.270
the very first question that people ask me when I returned from Antarctica was

564
00:33:32.271 --> 00:33:36.740
that,
was it cold Robert?
So effectively when he said,
people,

565
00:33:36.741 --> 00:33:40.580
when you come from Antarctica and people ask,
was the continuant cold?

566
00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:44.330
Then at that moment,
you know that people are inherently a little stupid.

567
00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:49.310
Therefore you do need to bother about their opinions on the over email
exchanges.

568
00:33:49.311 --> 00:33:52.910
I figured out that he was going on another expedition to Antarctica,

569
00:33:52.911 --> 00:33:53.960
that particular ear.

570
00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:59.890
So I asked him if I could join him in the same and he more than was glad he

571
00:34:00.681 --> 00:34:02.720
asked me to fundraise for it.
Uh,

572
00:34:02.721 --> 00:34:07.490
I went to a couple of companies and ask them are to support me and they said,
no,

573
00:34:07.491 --> 00:34:10.610
this is not a venture that they'd be interested in.

574
00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:13.370
So I looked at setting up my own venture.
Uh,

575
00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:17.780
I started to train for g mat where wherein I could raise money to go ahead and

576
00:34:17.781 --> 00:34:22.220
start going on this expedition.
It was almost like a six month planning.
Uh,

577
00:34:22.221 --> 00:34:26.390
I lived in Argentina for almost like 20 days because the terrain on the Anders

578
00:34:26.391 --> 00:34:28.730
is going to be similar to the terrain in Antarctica.

579
00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:31.550
So effectively it was like training on the Anders.

580
00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:36.290
And if you actually look at the Spec a while,
we train for 15 days on this,

581
00:34:36.910 --> 00:34:39.980
uh,
and this range and then started on our expedition.

582
00:34:39.981 --> 00:34:43.100
We took all these lovely pictures.
Then we went onto the expedition.

583
00:34:43.101 --> 00:34:46.820
One of the classic mistakes that I did during training was that I was never

584
00:34:46.821 --> 00:34:50.030
wearing hand gloves,
uh,
while I was holding my crutches.

585
00:34:50.390 --> 00:34:54.410
But when I went to the Antarctic,
the first thing I had to do was wear handlers.

586
00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:57.680
And then I realized the moment I wear those thick hand gloves,

587
00:34:57.890 --> 00:35:01.490
I can never hold my crutches,
can never actually hold my crutches.

588
00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:04.580
So the entire plan literally went to dogs.

589
00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:08.060
At that moment I decided I will take revenge on the Britishers because we

590
00:35:08.061 --> 00:35:11.810
carried them on our country for almost 200 years.
So I asked this British men,

591
00:35:11.811 --> 00:35:15.440
can you carry me for a good two miles so that we can get into the continent?

592
00:35:15.441 --> 00:35:19.850
Once we reached there,
he said,
okay,
take care.
Then we design sledges.

593
00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:24.210
We got pulled for almost like five miles.
And on a Shaver,

594
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:28.010
our three day at the intersection of the Pacific and the Atlantic Ocean,

595
00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:30.920
I decided I will take what is called as the polar plunge.

596
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:33.860
And we recorded that moment.

597
00:35:33.861 --> 00:35:36.950
And finally on the or our three day only,
we kind,

598
00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:40.740
it became the first Asian with a disability to step on to the Antarctic

599
00:35:40.741 --> 00:35:45.450
continent.
And,
uh,
from there we kind of put up this pictures.

600
00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:50.100
And by the time I returned to India,
this video started to go viral.

601
00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:53.230
And people were like,
you know,
a handicapped,
they went on 30 calls,

602
00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:55.290
so this element aren't calls.
So then people are like,

603
00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:59.580
if that fellow goes to Antarctica,
you can at least go to school and large stuff.

604
00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:03.960
And when people started to notice all lists,
uh,
meanwhile,

605
00:36:03.961 --> 00:36:07.920
as if all this was not enough,
all the villain reentered life.
And she was like,

606
00:36:07.921 --> 00:36:12.270
you know,
I always knew that you had the talent to,
to excel in life and that,

607
00:36:12.271 --> 00:36:14.940
you know,
you could do well and achieve big things.

608
00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:18.870
So why don't you guide my children also an inspire them and all that stuff.

609
00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:23.180
That was the first point I realized in life that people's opinions can change

610
00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:26.190
drastically.
They'll have one view of you today,

611
00:36:26.410 --> 00:36:31.260
another view of you the next day.
Their opinions have no stability.
And,

612
00:36:31.261 --> 00:36:35.550
uh,
another thing was as if,
uh,
all these good things,

613
00:36:35.551 --> 00:36:39.030
we're not enough or of nowhere,
remember the video that I first put up,

614
00:36:39.031 --> 00:36:40.480
which are two views,
uh,

615
00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:44.550
that was picked up by American and he was launching his shows at the mayor of JT

616
00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:48.480
and amount of research that went into that video kind of impressed him and he

617
00:36:48.481 --> 00:36:51.900
said,
why don't you actually come over and have a talk on the show?

618
00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:55.890
So this is like a classic Steve jobs quote where the dots got connected

619
00:36:55.891 --> 00:36:59.910
backwards and a effectively from there on,
once I got into [inaudible],

620
00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:02.750
j a ISB was also interested.

621
00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:06.890
I started working with Isb and uh,
graduated from the school.
Uh,

622
00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:09.480
I started to work for whom ministry,
uh,

623
00:37:09.481 --> 00:37:12.660
wherein we kind of looked at generating jobs for people with disabilities where

624
00:37:12.661 --> 00:37:17.190
a disability could actually be an advantage.
Uh,
but before we get there,

625
00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:20.010
it was at this moment,
uh,

626
00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:23.760
wherein I started to do the Sky Earth water thing.

627
00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:28.410
I started to realize that a lot of people in our country are very,

628
00:37:28.411 --> 00:37:33.040
very stigmatic about even expressing that they have a disability.
Uh,

629
00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:35.610
we are in a city,
we are in Hyderabad.
Uh,

630
00:37:35.730 --> 00:37:40.080
so effectively we talk of words like inclusivity,
accessibility or,
and all that.

631
00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:44.280
But when you go 15 miles south of the city or any direction of the city,

632
00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:45.810
if you go into a rural area,

633
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:49.460
people wouldn't even want to share that their child would have a discipline

634
00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:53.580
disability as primarily because they are worried about how the life would

635
00:37:53.581 --> 00:37:57.120
actually turn up to just reflect that,
uh,

636
00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:01.440
reflecting on that and wondering,
you know,
how can I actually help those people?

637
00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:05.550
Uh,
I was talking to my professor at Isb and he was like,
you know,

638
00:38:05.551 --> 00:38:08.910
you did all these projects about sky earth,
water and all that stuff,

639
00:38:08.911 --> 00:38:13.890
which is great.
Uh,
but it is only working on the awareness component.
He said,

640
00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:18.510
every social problem has got three components in all one the awareness
component.

641
00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:23.520
Another is the action component on third is the accountability component.
Uh,

642
00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:27.180
things like this generate awareness that there is a problem or there,

643
00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:28.890
there could be a solution out there.

644
00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:32.070
It was a very interesting talk by my professor conversation with my professor

645
00:38:32.071 --> 00:38:33.570
where he told me that Sy,

646
00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:37.480
while a lot of people say that in all these activities are inspiring.

647
00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:40.170
A ask yourself what inspiration is.

648
00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:45.580
Inspiration is not about overcoming a challenge because if you are inspiring by

649
00:38:45.581 --> 00:38:47.950
doing all these activities and overcoming the challenge,

650
00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:52.330
you're also sending a soft message that there is going to be a problem and still

651
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:55.090
people have to overcome it.
It's almost like,
you know,

652
00:38:55.091 --> 00:38:59.170
a mother will come to the college and if the mother sees me,
she tells her child,

653
00:38:59.171 --> 00:39:02.650
you know what?
There is this good.
He,
he claimed the three floors,

654
00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:05.770
he kind of did well in life.
So you also claim three floors.

655
00:39:05.771 --> 00:39:08.170
You will also do life well in live and all that.

656
00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:10.660
He told me that inspiration is not about overcoming.

657
00:39:10.661 --> 00:39:14.830
The challenge to inspiration is about asking why the challenges there in the

658
00:39:14.831 --> 00:39:18.400
first place and how can we remove that challenge once and for all.

659
00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:22.450
She challenged me to think beyond the obvious and he said,
you know,

660
00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:26.890
stop on the awareness aspect and think more on the action and accountability

661
00:39:26.891 --> 00:39:29.410
angle.
And it is there that,
you know,

662
00:39:29.411 --> 00:39:32.710
the major challenge came because when he started to work on the action items,

663
00:39:33.010 --> 00:39:35.650
I wanted to generate jobs for people with disabilities.

664
00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:38.170
Within that we looked at four segments.

665
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:41.050
One segment was the educated and employed segment,

666
00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:45.190
which is what is a justice aura fair system,
educated,

667
00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:48.820
educated people with disabilities.
Those people being employed.

668
00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:51.940
Then there are an educated people with disabilities.

669
00:39:52.210 --> 00:39:55.420
They are employed that sheer luck,
you won't find anyone up there.

670
00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:59.710
Then there are educated people with disabilities,
but they are not employed.

671
00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:02.410
This is the discrimination segment.
Finally,

672
00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:06.970
finally came the an educated people with disabilities are not being employed.

673
00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:11.390
There are,
God knows how many people exactly,
uh,

674
00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:16.260
with disabilities in our country.
Believe it or not,
till 2010,
uh,

675
00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:20.260
the government of India even refused to count the number of people with

676
00:40:20.261 --> 00:40:23.290
disabilities because the major challenge when we filed our ta,

677
00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:27.780
we came to know a as to why people with disabilities were not countered,
uh,

678
00:40:27.781 --> 00:40:31.300
was uh,
then the census is conducted.

679
00:40:31.301 --> 00:40:36.160
You have to go to a particular place and ask questions to the people.

680
00:40:36.490 --> 00:40:38.320
And in remote villages,

681
00:40:38.321 --> 00:40:41.680
interior villages and all you speak in local language.

682
00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:46.120
So effectively when the census is conducted and you go to a particular house and

683
00:40:46.121 --> 00:40:47.610
they have to ask that person,
you know,

684
00:40:47.611 --> 00:40:51.610
do you have anyone with her mental disability or mental challenge at your house?

685
00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:55.010
Effectively in Hindi you have to basically ask capture Girma [inaudible] right

686
00:40:55.011 --> 00:40:57.790
there.
So effectively that gets very offensive.

687
00:40:57.970 --> 00:41:02.890
So you just can't let go into [inaudible] and the 90 will bring up a points to

688
00:41:02.891 --> 00:41:03.520
air.

689
00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:08.380
And I say I done all that so effectively since there was no terminology for

690
00:41:08.381 --> 00:41:11.730
people with mental disabilities,
the government decided us sweet shortcut,

691
00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:13.900
they decided let's not come.
Okay.

692
00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:17.830
So effectively it took a long time for the government to decide.

693
00:41:17.831 --> 00:41:22.831
We are to frame a word for this then ask them right now the trending word is DVR

694
00:41:23.161 --> 00:41:27.730
Unger.
So basically our divine Oregon right now,
uh,
because of which I can,

695
00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:29.200
I don't know do what,

696
00:41:29.201 --> 00:41:32.340
but the government has decided that right now we all will be called the Dave

697
00:41:32.341 --> 00:41:35.710
young and now we are going to get countered and policies are going to be framing

698
00:41:35.711 --> 00:41:40.040
it.
Fair enough.
But there was this huge group of people who are uneducated,

699
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:41.060
unemployed.

700
00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:46.060
This is almost like three to 7% of the country and they are going to be left out

701
00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:49.520
of the employment frame,
which means they can't contribute to GDP,

702
00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:54.200
which means they're willing to be a burden on the family.
That owning a,

703
00:41:54.201 --> 00:41:56.960
which means that there is going to be unrest,

704
00:41:57.110 --> 00:42:02.110
which means that there is going to be frustration and effectively we,

705
00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:06.620
it was my goal that instead of working in the discrimination segment,

706
00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:11.800
we might want to work in the segment where people are uneducated and unemployed.

707
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:16.870
That took my focus to the hospitality industry where in I looked at jobs for

708
00:42:17.031 --> 00:42:20.270
people with disabilities where disability could be an advantage.

709
00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:24.380
The primary source of the idea came from the Mughal emperors wherein all the

710
00:42:24.381 --> 00:42:28.280
servants of the queen of the Mughal emperor a that used to be blind.

711
00:42:28.610 --> 00:42:31.100
All the spies or any others used to be deaf.

712
00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:36.340
They used their disability in such a way that effectively in that job disability

713
00:42:36.771 --> 00:42:39.980
would be a primary advantage.
Now,

714
00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:44.690
not debating the morals or ethics of this,
but it got the job done.

715
00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:49.010
We looked at certain jobs where noise could be a problem.
For instance,

716
00:42:49.011 --> 00:42:53.120
if there is a traffic police and he's going to get affected by the traffic
noise,

717
00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:55.700
we believe and he has to speak only through science,

718
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:59.870
then a person with a hearing disability would be an ideal fit.
In fact,

719
00:42:59.871 --> 00:43:04.370
a person with hearing disability could be a job requirement in that scenario

720
00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:08.480
because if you're constantly exposed to so much noise,
you get frustrated.

721
00:43:08.481 --> 00:43:12.770
Then you get angry,
you get drunk,
then you go on beauty or wife.
Okay.

722
00:43:12.771 --> 00:43:16.860
So effectively you could prevent this whole chain of events where in we'll look

723
00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:21.880
at any job where noise was going to be a deterrent to the quality of the

724
00:43:22.101 --> 00:43:22.934
performance.

725
00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:27.530
The hearing impairment will actually act as a deterrent and we kind of made like

726
00:43:27.531 --> 00:43:30.380
a fantastic report for the hospitality industry.

727
00:43:30.381 --> 00:43:32.690
We also looked at the pharmaceutical industry.

728
00:43:32.691 --> 00:43:37.070
We looked at a few jobs in the IT industry and we flipped the paradigm wherein

729
00:43:37.071 --> 00:43:41.000
instead of asking corporates to generate jobs for people with disabilities,

730
00:43:41.001 --> 00:43:44.720
we kind of looked at the people with disabilities and thought,
hey,

731
00:43:44.721 --> 00:43:49.340
what jobs are they going to be in in which their disability in itself is going

732
00:43:49.341 --> 00:43:53.450
to be actually an advantage.
We made a fantastic report.

733
00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:57.830
We submitted it to the home ministry.
Uh,
I don't know what happened after that,

734
00:43:57.831 --> 00:44:02.150
how many jobs we've got generated or how many summers has got a 10 on that

735
00:44:02.151 --> 00:44:06.290
research report.
But effectively we started to make slow progress.

736
00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:09.980
That took me my attention finally to the third component,

737
00:44:09.981 --> 00:44:11.600
which is on the accountability angered.

738
00:44:12.350 --> 00:44:17.350
A lot of times people believe that any issue related to disability should

739
00:44:18.111 --> 00:44:22.220
actually be addressed by government.
But when I actually look at it,

740
00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:25.880
it is not something that the government needs to address.
For instance,
you know,

741
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.310
if I go to my father and said,
dad,
you know,

742
00:44:28.311 --> 00:44:32.040
this room and the stables location here is kind of hurting me.

743
00:44:32.041 --> 00:44:34.470
He does not tell me.
Go on,
speak to their district collector.

744
00:44:34.471 --> 00:44:38.430
He will come and change.
My Dad doesn't run an initiative at housing,
you know,

745
00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:42.260
today we'll consider it as well.
Disability Day in our house are,

746
00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:45.900
he doesn't run inclusivity initiatives.
He doesn't,
uh,

747
00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:48.090
basically run it like a corporate.

748
00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:51.900
The reason he took care of me was that he could,

749
00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:55.050
he believed that I was part of the family.
It,

750
00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:59.430
I wouldn't even call it laugh.
He believed that it was his responsibility.

751
00:44:59.431 --> 00:45:01.110
Once I became his family member,

752
00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:06.290
he believed that everything I face is going to be ending up as a responsibility

753
00:45:06.331 --> 00:45:10.080
or accountability on him.
Took responsibility for my education.

754
00:45:10.081 --> 00:45:14.100
He took accountability.
When the principals call it year after year,

755
00:45:14.101 --> 00:45:18.210
year after year,
and said,
your son would not be an ideal fit at the school.

756
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:21.210
He moved me around at multiple schools.

757
00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:23.880
He spoke and convinced multiple principals.

758
00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:27.690
When my mom kind of like took me across the street every day,

759
00:45:27.691 --> 00:45:28.800
all those two years,

760
00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:33.450
they look at it as an initiative or an extra curricular activity or house.

761
00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:37.680
They knew that this was a fundamental responsibility because they knew that I

762
00:45:37.681 --> 00:45:39.090
was part of the family.

763
00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:44.010
Somehow when I move into a corporate environment from a family,

764
00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:49.400
that angle on this member is my family gets missing because we start to think,

765
00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:55.560
hey,
he's different.
My life is different.
I have my own problems in life.

766
00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:59.280
Let me sort that out.
The head HR is there for this.
Uh,

767
00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:02.970
and I believe that is what we are trying to address through initiatives like

768
00:46:02.971 --> 00:46:07.920
this because you would really want to understand that each person right from the

769
00:46:07.921 --> 00:46:12.210
bottom of the ground to the top level CEO can play a huge role,

770
00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:16.960
play a huge role.
It could be something as small as the height of this chair.
Uh,

771
00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:22.310
when you're addressing a particular gathering that makes all the difference to

772
00:46:22.411 --> 00:46:23.220
water,

773
00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:27.780
a person is going to feel odd excel at the office on.

774
00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:30.600
And when you start to show so much empathy,

775
00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:35.370
then the person also feels responsible to contribute.
For instance,

776
00:46:35.371 --> 00:46:40.200
remember back and 10th class really care what my performance in education is

777
00:46:40.201 --> 00:46:40.651
going to be.

778
00:46:40.651 --> 00:46:45.120
But when I realized that my parents were putting in so much effort and that they

779
00:46:45.121 --> 00:46:47.490
were disappointed,
my perform with my performance.

780
00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:52.760
And then I went out of the way to actually help and focus on study and finally

781
00:46:54.301 --> 00:46:55.111
start to deliver.

782
00:46:55.111 --> 00:46:59.130
And Dale came a point over a period of time where my own attitude,

783
00:46:59.131 --> 00:47:03.150
abilities and talents transformed.
And it sat in front of my dad.

784
00:47:03.151 --> 00:47:06.060
The man who first told me,
education is the way out.

785
00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:10.560
There came a day where I told him that I need to go ahead and study abroad.

786
00:47:10.561 --> 00:47:13.590
I don't care what your fears are.
This is what I need to do.

787
00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:17.960
That's the transformation that happens through this transformation.
Uh,

788
00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:21.180
there are going to be conflicts.
There are going to be villains,

789
00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:25.950
there are going to be obedience.
Uh,
there are going to be failures.

790
00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:29.710
There are going to be stupid moments,
there are going to be moments of guilt,

791
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:34.780
but you will realize that when you're fighting for what you are believing in and

792
00:47:34.781 --> 00:47:37.780
when you're fighting for what you think is right for your life,

793
00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:41.110
things might go wrong.
But even if they go wrong,

794
00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:44.860
you will do course correction over a period of time and you will end up in a

795
00:47:44.861 --> 00:47:47.170
place where in hopefully one day you can sit in a place,

796
00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:48.760
a sit on the chair like me.

797
00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:53.260
I am doing today and probably talk of what happened over 30 years of life in a

798
00:47:53.261 --> 00:47:54.160
30 minute seminar.

799
00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:57.490
It's pretty much what I actually wanted to convey over the session.

800
00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:00.580
If you have any questions,
I'd be more than glad to take it.
Thank you.
