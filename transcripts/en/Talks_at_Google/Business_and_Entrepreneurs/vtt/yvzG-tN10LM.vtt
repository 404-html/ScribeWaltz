00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.040
Hi everyone and welcome to the toxic Google event.

2
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.190
And I would like to introduce Isaac.
So,
uh,

3
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.500
we are here for his book,
Eyes Wide Open.

4
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.320
Isaac was born with a rare degenerative disease of retina that caused them to

5
00:00:23.321 --> 00:00:27.240
gradually loses sight despite all the hurdles that his did.
This,

6
00:00:27.241 --> 00:00:32.020
this is brought upon him.
Isaac has led a very successful life.
He played visa,

7
00:00:32.021 --> 00:00:33.220
answered by the bell.

8
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.200
He graduated from Harvard College at age of 19 with a degree in mathematics and

9
00:00:38.201 --> 00:00:39.100
computer science.

10
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.490
He also graduated from Harvard law school and served as a law clerk for Supreme

11
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.900
Court justice,
Sandra O'Connor and Ruth Ginsberg.

12
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.240
He also transformed a struggling concrete subcontractor into an industry leading

13
00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.970
with $150 million business.

14
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.050
And along with this he has also found hope provision,

15
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.160
which is a nonprofit for that funds the development of treatments for binding

16
00:01:03.161 --> 00:01:06.130
diseases in eyes wide open,

17
00:01:06.131 --> 00:01:08.500
which is part autobiography and parts of help,

18
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.560
Isaac Lidsky shares a very inspiring story of achieving success in his life.

19
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.090
So I'd like to introduce Isaac.

20
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.350
<v 0>Excellent.
How's everybody doing?</v>

21
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.130
All right.
Yeah,
I was gonna say,
I gotta hear you.
Cause I obviously can't see you.

22
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.830
I say that a sighted people are terrified of speaking to big crowds,

23
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.800
but it's blind folks are terrified of speaking to empty rooms.

24
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.910
So I want to know you're out there.
All right.

25
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.790
So I'm going to ask you to take a car ride with me,
uh,
this afternoon.

26
00:01:45.791 --> 00:01:47.830
Imagine yourself taking a car ride with me this afternoon.

27
00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:48.970
So let me give you the context.

28
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.900
You are 13 years old,

29
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.550
so I know for some of you Googlers that's not that far back.
But uh,

30
00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.950
for others it's a while back so they take a second.

31
00:01:59.951 --> 00:02:03.010
Think back to who you were at 13.
What was going on in your life at that time.

32
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.451
All right,

33
00:02:04.451 --> 00:02:09.160
so you're 13 and your sibling has always been a little clumsy.

34
00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.810
It's sort of part of her sunny absent minded disposition.
Um,

35
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.890
it's Kinda cute,
but not recently.
Recently,
uh,

36
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.210
there have been some pretty nasty bumps and bruises and some serious scares.

37
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.210
A tragedy was nearly avoided a couple of times.

38
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.560
It seems the problem has something to do with your siblings.
Eyesight.

39
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.560
Your mom takes you all to the neighborhood ophthalmologist office for a checkup.

40
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.330
Now,
there's nothing wrong with your eyes,
right?
Remember,
you're 13 years old,

41
00:02:40.331 --> 00:02:44.700
so you're perfect.
At least you think you do.
You think you are.
And,
uh,

42
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.200
everything's,
uh,
everything's going well.
Nothing wrong with your eyes,

43
00:02:47.201 --> 00:02:51.220
but still the ophthalmologist is clearly troubled by something he sees.

44
00:02:51.221 --> 00:02:56.221
And he tells your mom to take all of you kids to the medical research institute

45
00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.630
at the,
uh,
the medical school,
the university in town.
So off you go.

46
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.320
And after a very long day of strange and sort of a grueling eye exams,

47
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.100
the expert tells you that,
uh,
like your sibling,

48
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.030
you have a eye disease that causes progressive loss of sight and blindness.

49
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.200
So that,
that's what happened to me.
The sibling was my sister Darya.

50
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.070
The research institute was the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute,
um,

51
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.080
at the University of Miami.
It was 1993 and I was 13 years old.

52
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.630
Now before that day,
I was living a Hollywood fairy tale.
Um,

53
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.580
I was born to a middle class family and America to parents who loved me and

54
00:03:42.581 --> 00:03:46.710
nurtured me and cared for my education.
I loved school,
came easy to me.
Uh,
and uh,

55
00:03:46.711 --> 00:03:50.470
I enjoyed it very much.
And as you heard the Hollywood part,
I mean it literally,

56
00:03:50.471 --> 00:03:54.070
I grew up acting.
I did about a hundred to 150 commercials,

57
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.300
got some lucky breaks here and there and,
uh,

58
00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.330
it was ultimately cast as weasel wise l on NBC TVs saved by the Bell,

59
00:04:01.661 --> 00:04:05.290
the new class.
I was the sort of Dorky character,
the nerd.

60
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.500
So it was quite a challenge for me as an actor
nonetheless.
Uh,

61
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.343
I played that role.

62
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.840
So that was before at the end of the long day at Bascom Palmer eye institute,

63
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:19.840
everything,
everything changed,
right?

64
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.930
Dr w called us into his office.

65
00:04:22.931 --> 00:04:26.110
He took a medical textbook off the shelf behind his desk.

66
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.470
He flipped through the pages,
found the one he wanted,
uh,

67
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.150
put the book on the desk facing us and he pointed to some photographs.

68
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:36.011
He said,

69
00:04:36.011 --> 00:04:39.250
those are pictures of the retinas of patients with a disease called retinitis

70
00:04:39.251 --> 00:04:40.450
Pigmentosa or RP.

71
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.040
Rp Causes Progressive Loss of sight and ultimately blindness.

72
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.560
A diary and Isaac have RP and we'll go blind.
There are no treatments,

73
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.210
there are no cures.
We don't really know much about the disease.
Good luck.

74
00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.280
That was it.
We got up and we left

75
00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.340
and we got back in my mom's car for a long ride home.
So that's the Colorado.

76
00:05:06.341 --> 00:05:10.510
Want you to imagine yourselves?
Uh,
take them with me this afternoon please.

77
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.970
So you sit in the back of the car,
your mom tries,

78
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.840
tries very hard not to cry with little success.

79
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:21.820
Your siblings are crying too,

80
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.780
and you are trying to make some sense of the diagnosis of the information you've

81
00:05:29.111 --> 00:05:31.030
just gained for miles and miles.

82
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.420
So how do you feel and what is it that you're thinking in that car?

83
00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.270
Fear is a powerfully destructive force in our lives.

84
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.580
Fear distorts all reality under the warped logic of fear.

85
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.980
Anything is better than the uncertain.
Fear will fill the void at all costs.

86
00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.950
Passing off what you dread for what you know,

87
00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.620
offering up the worst in place of the ambiguous substituting assumption for

88
00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:06.860
reason.
Psychologists call it awfulizing,
right?

89
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.920
Fear replaces the unknown with the awful.

90
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:12.770
Now fear is self.

91
00:06:12.771 --> 00:06:17.771
Realizing when we face the greatest need to look beyond ourselves to gain more

92
00:06:18.501 --> 00:06:20.510
information,
to think critically,

93
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:26.060
fear beats a retreat deep inside your mind,
shrinking and distorting your view.

94
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.830
Drowning your capacity for critical thought with a flood of disruptive emotions.

95
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:36.080
When you face a compelling opportunity to transcend,
to thrive,

96
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.730
to overcome fear,
uh,

97
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.510
lulls you into inaction,

98
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:47.120
enticing you to passively watch its prophecies fulfill themselves.

99
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:51.680
So how did I feel in the back of my mom's car?
I felt terrified.

100
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.750
And what was I thinking?

101
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.040
I was thinking blindness will absolutely ruin my life.

102
00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:04.180
Uh,
in fact,
I wasn't thinking that so much as I knew it.
I don't think I know it.

103
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.240
Here's what I knew in the back of that car that day.

104
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:14.270
Blindness will ruin my life.
Blindness was a death sentence for my independence.

105
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.120
Blindness is the end of achievement for me.

106
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:22.460
It means that I am going to live an unremarkable life,
small and sad.

107
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.650
Um,
I'm going to live that life alone.

108
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.810
No woman is going to love or respect me.
I'm not going to love or respect myself.

109
00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:31.880
Um,
so I won't have any kids,

110
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:36.680
which is probably for the better because no child deserves that and in a sense,

111
00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:38.510
uh,
I'm always going to be a child.

112
00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:42.560
So that's what I knew in the back of that car that day.

113
00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:44.520
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

114
00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:48.900
<v 0>Now,
fears work doesn't end with the baseless reality.</v>

115
00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.240
It can Cox in your mind.

116
00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:57.770
That's where few fears work really begins to perpetuate this reality.

117
00:07:57.931 --> 00:08:01.260
Fear must trick you into playing your part.

118
00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:06.120
Now fears accomplices in this con or heroes and villains,

119
00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:11.820
fear conjures up a world in which heroes and villains do battle for your fate.

120
00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:17.280
Like a goddess of Greek mythology,
acting from Mount Olympus,

121
00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.610
right?
Blamed your villains.

122
00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.090
Fear will whisper in your ear the fault lies with others.

123
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:28.380
The problem is your circumstances worship your heroes.

124
00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.520
Fear will admonish you.
They have the power to fix this.
They can save you.

125
00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.250
Your heroes will make you happy.

126
00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:41.520
The drama is epic and endless heroes and villains doing battle for your fate.

127
00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:46.730
You sit back,
you try to take it all in.
You try to keep it all straight.
Yeah,

128
00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.090
you're trying to figure out where it's all going,

129
00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:55.210
but it's all smoke and mirrors.
It's a,
it's a diversion.
It's special effects.

130
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:56.390
Now,

131
00:08:56.390 --> 00:09:01.260
what really matters is that you have become a cooperative participant in fears.

132
00:09:01.261 --> 00:09:04.950
Reality,
right?
You play Nice.

133
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:08.100
You don't question the apprentice.
You abdicate responsibility.

134
00:09:08.101 --> 00:09:11.670
You blame and credit others.
Meanwhile,

135
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.550
fear spell remains unbroken.

136
00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:21.120
So my villain was blindness,
not with a lower case B,

137
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:25.140
as in the condition of sightlessness,
but blindness with a capital B.

138
00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:30.140
There's a morphous boogeyman that was going to hunt me down and destroy my life.

139
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:36.890
My heroes were the brilliant research scientists working so hard to deliver a

140
00:09:37.051 --> 00:09:40.590
cure for my disease.
They would do it in time.
They would save me.

141
00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:46.110
They simply had to
living in the reality of my fears.

142
00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:50.970
My life became a race against the clock.
I wasn't in the race.

143
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.350
I was on the sidelines,
right?
Uh,

144
00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:56.460
watching his blindness was out way in front and only widening the gap.

145
00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:02.100
Didn't look very good for me.
Now,
those were some really dark years in my life.

146
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.810
Then I learned to see through my fear.
I'm eyes wide open

147
00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.040
if you can not believe it.
It began with my mother in law.

148
00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:14.630
She's an unlikely heroine in the story though.

149
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.490
At the time she was the mother of my girlfriend Dorothy.

150
00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:23.220
So
Brenda is an occupational therapist.

151
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.850
She was the director of occupational therapy at the Lucerne spinal injury
center,

152
00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.270
or a typical patient was a woman who was thrown by a horse,

153
00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.920
instantly became a quadriplegic.

154
00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:35.940
Brenda's patient meets a with doctors and nurses,

155
00:10:35.941 --> 00:10:40.620
had some surgeries mourns with friends and family.
Then she meets Brenda.

156
00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:43.500
Brenda's job is the rest of the patient's life.

157
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.910
So Brenda assesses the patient's capabilities,
surveys,

158
00:10:47.911 --> 00:10:50.940
the myriad tools and technologies that are available to supplement those

159
00:10:50.941 --> 00:10:52.260
capabilities.
Right.

160
00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:56.670
She develops a discrete solutions for concrete problems.

161
00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:00.890
Maybe she a rigs up up homemade joystick to Maaco,

162
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:04.410
a homemade attachment to make a joystick on a wheelchair more accessible,

163
00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:09.720
or she introduces tools to help her patient feed herself.
Grooming and hygiene,

164
00:11:09.721 --> 00:11:13.800
getting an end of the bed,
reading a book,
right.
Take the problems one at a time,

165
00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.050
figure out a solution.
That's Brenda's perspective.

166
00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:22.710
So when Dorothy and I were dating,
um,
without us knowing anything about it,

167
00:11:22.711 --> 00:11:25.140
re Brian,
it began to research some solutions for uh,

168
00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.550
the partially sighted in the blind and one thing led to another and she found

169
00:11:29.551 --> 00:11:30.150
Chris.

170
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:34.650
Chris was an expert in the field who are working in Boston where Dorothy and I

171
00:11:34.651 --> 00:11:35.484
were living.

172
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:39.750
I went to go meet with Chris and it completely changed my life.

173
00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:46.470
So I walk into,
I walk into Chris's Office,
um,
and right away she asks me,

174
00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:51.600
Isaac,
do you ever use a cane?
I'm a little confused and I'm really annoyed.

175
00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:54.400
I'm thinking of myself not,
why don't use a cane?
I mean,

176
00:11:54.401 --> 00:11:57.670
I still see too well to use a cane and don't,
I mean he isn't.

177
00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:01.900
She supposed to be the expert besides,
I'm not here to talk about candy canes,

178
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:06.100
like an arbitrary detail.
Right.
We were talking about blindness.
I say to her,

179
00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:10.210
nope,
Chris,
I don't use a cane.
She says,
well,

180
00:12:10.211 --> 00:12:13.810
do you bump into things and hurt yourself like an,
of course,

181
00:12:13.811 --> 00:12:18.100
they bump into things.
It hurt myself all the time.
In fact,
two days ago,

182
00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:23.500
I walked right into a fire hydrant,
a splitting my pants against my shin.

183
00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:27.070
It bled a ton and it left me with a heinous Bruce.

184
00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:31.450
So I rolled up the leg of my jeans,
showed the Bruce to Chris.
I said,
Chris,
yeah,

185
00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.260
you know,
you could say,
I bumped into things and hurt myself.
No big deal.

186
00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:39.520
I'm really want Chris to understand how little I care about bumping into fix

187
00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:43.960
right now is not my problem.
Today is not my problem.

188
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:47.050
Bumping into things is not my problem.
My problem is tomorrow.

189
00:12:47.051 --> 00:12:50.830
The future is blindness is my life is going to end right?

190
00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:54.310
My problem is that I am losing my sight and there's nothing I can do about it.

191
00:12:56.930 --> 00:13:00.830
Chris says to me,
you know,
Isaac,
if,
uh,

192
00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:05.930
if you use a cane,
you'd bump into things less and you'd hurt yourself less.

193
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:11.480
Man,
it was an obvious point,
right?
Pretty obvious point.
Now.

194
00:13:11.481 --> 00:13:13.340
I know you guys are all Googlers here,
so you're very smart.

195
00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:18.170
I'm only a little embarrassed to admit it was such an obvious point for me that

196
00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:19.700
day that it really,
it was like an epiphany.

197
00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:23.990
I realized that there is only now.

198
00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.960
There was only today,
this moment,

199
00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:33.880
in that moment I saw that everything I thought I knew about blindness was a

200
00:13:36.681 --> 00:13:40.070
complete fiction.
Born of my fears lies.

201
00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:44.330
What did I really know about going blind or being blind?
Absolutely nothing.

202
00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:48.080
What had I done to learn about it?
Nothing.

203
00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:52.250
So I was trapped in fears tunnel,

204
00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:56.820
unable to see the,
uh,
unbounded potential.

205
00:13:56.821 --> 00:14:01.821
The vast landscape that lay just beyond Chris has pointed out.

206
00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:05.630
The cane was a pinprick of bright light that led me out of that tunnel.

207
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:10.280
There was something that I can do right away right now today to make my life a

208
00:14:10.281 --> 00:14:14.840
little easier,
to make my life better.
I caught on quickly,
I said,

209
00:14:14.841 --> 00:14:17.000
what else can I do?
Chris had all sorts of ideas,
right?

210
00:14:17.001 --> 00:14:21.560
Screen reading software to interact with my computer using my ears instead of my

211
00:14:21.561 --> 00:14:22.394
eyes.

212
00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:26.960
A technique called sighted guide to walk around with people a more naturally and

213
00:14:26.961 --> 00:14:29.100
more safely,
uh,

214
00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:32.990
techniques and systems to organize my clothing and my shoes so I could dress

215
00:14:32.991 --> 00:14:37.790
myself and match or at least where,
what I wanted to wear.
Um,

216
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:41.900
simple solutions for discrete,
specific practical problems.

217
00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:46.520
So I decided that day in Chris's office made myself a promise.

218
00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:50.900
Whenever I feel afraid,
I'm going to ask myself two questions.

219
00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:52.663
One,

220
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:57.970
what precisely is my problem right now broken down into its smallest,

221
00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:02.150
most discrete,
most manageable for them right now?

222
00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:06.860
What's my problem to what precisely can I do about it?

223
00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:10.100
No heroes,
no villains.
Me.

224
00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:13.930
Now word of caution,

225
00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:17.200
you have to answer those questions for yourself in the vein of like cspan

226
00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:21.020
coverage of some,
you know,
boring and mundane procedural,

227
00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.880
a committee hearing or something like that.

228
00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:26.570
You can't answer that question in the vein of a Hollywood blockbuster.
Okay?

229
00:15:26.571 --> 00:15:30.380
There's no,
uh,
no action sequences,
no special effects,
oh,
soundtrack.

230
00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:31.880
It's just dialogue.
No drama.

231
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:37.340
When I committed to answer those two questions for myself.
And that way,

232
00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:39.920
whenever I faced fear,
my life turned around,

233
00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:44.540
I took control of my reality.

234
00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:50.230
I chose how I wanted to live my life and who I wanted to be.
Um,

235
00:15:50.231 --> 00:15:53.880
I broke fears spell.
Uh,

236
00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.550
I went on to build a very blessed life for myself on that,
uh,

237
00:15:57.551 --> 00:16:02.000
uncharted terrain beyond fears tunnel.
Um,
I,
I did marry,

238
00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:06.350
um,
Dorothy and I,
uh,
had triplets.

239
00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:10.520
Uh,
and we,
we enjoy that so much.
So we had that had a fourth trial,

240
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.140
sweet baby clementine.

241
00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:16.120
So a six and a half year old triplets and a 15 month old baby.
Um,

242
00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:20.510
I'm immensely blessed and happy and fulfilled.

243
00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:25.820
Um,
but if I had not seen through,

244
00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:31.610
uh,
the reality of my fears,
uh,
I would have lived that reality.

245
00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:37.130
I'm absolutely certain of that fact.
So I'm wanting to say it one more time.

246
00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:41.660
If I hadn't seen through my fears,
I would have lived that reality.

247
00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:44.360
<v 3>So thank you.</v>

248
00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:53.320
<v 1>Thank you so much for a great introduction.
Um,</v>

249
00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:58.410
I would also like to open the floor for any Q and a that people would have in

250
00:16:58.411 --> 00:17:03.330
the meantime.
I have a question for you.
Cool.
Um,
despite all these hurdles,
it's,

251
00:17:03.331 --> 00:17:07.600
it's very difficult to,
but imagine being in that situation that you were in,
um,

252
00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:09.090
what kept you motivated?

253
00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:14.450
<v 0>So
the,</v>

254
00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:18.160
the way in which I lost my sight,
um,
it was,

255
00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:22.180
it's a progressive condition if you picture like a jumbo tron screen at an
arena.

256
00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:27.430
So imagine now that the sort of led bulbs on the screen are randomly breaking

257
00:17:27.431 --> 00:17:28.510
sort of slowly over time.

258
00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:31.000
And so you're watching my life as a movie on this screen.

259
00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.000
And at first you might not even notice it.

260
00:17:34.001 --> 00:17:37.180
Then it becomes annoying of certain parts of the screen are better than others.

261
00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:41.530
Um,
it created all these bizarre affects.
Uh,

262
00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:44.530
objects would sort of appear and morph and disappear.

263
00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:48.850
If I got information through other means through my,

264
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:52.140
if someone told me what I was looking at,
then suddenly I saw it.

265
00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:57.390
So the experience was,
was it was challenging,
um,
to put it mildly,

266
00:17:57.391 --> 00:18:01.440
but it was also a real gift.

267
00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:04.170
It turned out to be a real gift cause I got a peek behind the curtain and just

268
00:18:04.171 --> 00:18:05.870
sort of the way the mind works.
And this,

269
00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:09.450
this illusion of sight was shattered for me.

270
00:18:09.451 --> 00:18:14.451
So sight is something we experience as objective truth as reality is something

271
00:18:14.911 --> 00:18:18.960
that's out there,
um,
when,
when it's totally a creation of our own mind,

272
00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:22.960
which is,
which is built on much more than just data from the eyes.

273
00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:28.050
So anyway,
having sort of seen firsthand,

274
00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:33.080
literally seen the way we are empowered to create an experience for ourselves

275
00:18:33.631 --> 00:18:36.960
that is so immersive and complete that we then believe it to be true and

276
00:18:36.961 --> 00:18:40.560
objective.
That was the sort of eye opening.
Um,
you know,

277
00:18:40.561 --> 00:18:43.980
eyes wide open vision that like I said,

278
00:18:43.981 --> 00:18:46.530
turned out to be the greatest blessing in my life because when we create our

279
00:18:46.531 --> 00:18:51.240
realities in so many ways,
self limiting assumptions are fears.

280
00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:56.580
Uh,
our misconceptions about success and failure,
strength and weakness.

281
00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:01.890
Um,
the way we sort of misperceive luck,
oversimplify,
luck and on and on and on.

282
00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:06.240
So,
um,
you know,
what kept me going was really,
you know,

283
00:19:06.241 --> 00:19:10.350
at the end of the day,
this,
this a certainty that in every moment,

284
00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:14.730
in every moment we choose who we are and how we want to live our lives

285
00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:18.650
independent of the circumstances we face.
Absolutely.

286
00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.870
You mentioned briefly about,
look,

287
00:19:21.871 --> 00:19:26.550
how much do you think luck plays a role in our lives?
So there is,

288
00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:29.890
there's no question that luck,
uh,
you know,
having,
it's a sort of sense,

289
00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:34.260
it's beyond our control,
you know,
play a major factor in life.
I think however,

290
00:19:34.261 --> 00:19:36.450
that we tend to,
uh,

291
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:39.450
if not misperceive luck and certainly oversimplify it

292
00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:45.900
a so what do I mean
as,
for example,

293
00:19:45.901 --> 00:19:48.570
the notion that there's good luck and bad luck or that there are events that

294
00:19:48.571 --> 00:19:50.880
have an independent sort of value of good or bad?

295
00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:57.330
I think the truth is a lot more sort of nuanced and complex and the events are

296
00:19:57.331 --> 00:20:02.190
events and whether they're good or bad,
who knows?
And better than who knows?

297
00:20:02.191 --> 00:20:05.340
It's kind of within our control.
So for example,
uh,

298
00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:10.350
I was lucky to go blind.
Uh,
it may sound like a weird thing to say,

299
00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:13.890
but in my experience in my life,
it was the blessings,

300
00:20:13.891 --> 00:20:16.770
the sort of a perspective of the life that it has given me.

301
00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:19.590
There's just no question.
One of the best things that ever happened.

302
00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:25.170
Another way we tend to misperceive luck.
I think as we,
we again,
we,

303
00:20:25.171 --> 00:20:30.171
we think that there's a pretty clear bright line between circumstances within

304
00:20:30.451 --> 00:20:33.450
our control and circumstances without our control and sort of says we cannot

305
00:20:33.451 --> 00:20:35.490
control.
And again,

306
00:20:35.491 --> 00:20:38.940
I think the truth is really far more nuanced and complex really.
Um,

307
00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:42.640
most things are kind of in that gray area.
Uh,

308
00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:46.260
and we have a lot more control over,
uh,

309
00:20:46.261 --> 00:20:48.820
events in our lives and certainly the way we experience those events,

310
00:20:48.821 --> 00:20:52.870
how they manifest themselves in our lives.
Then we think.
Okay.

311
00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:55.280
<v 1>Um,
we have a question from audience.</v>

312
00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:57.123
<v 3>Hi,</v>

313
00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:00.230
<v 4>that day when you were 13,
when you got the diagnosis,</v>

314
00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:05.090
how long did it take for your vision to degenerate?
Um,

315
00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:08.270
like to the point where you were gonna say legally find it and how long until

316
00:21:08.271 --> 00:21:09.860
you totally lost your sight.

317
00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:14.990
<v 0>Sure.
So thanks.
That's a great question.
I mean,
the short answer is who knows,</v>

318
00:21:14.991 --> 00:21:16.760
it's hard to say,
uh,
this,

319
00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:21.590
this really is this sort of progressive and sort of slow death of photoreceptor

320
00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:26.330
cell.
So when did it start?
You know,
who knows,
when did it end?
Hard to say.
Um,

321
00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:30.770
I know that when I was diagnosed when I was 13 at the time,
uh,

322
00:21:30.771 --> 00:21:33.530
I would have said,
I see as well as any of my peers.

323
00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:37.520
I'm not sure that's actually true.
I literally don't know.
And there's some,

324
00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:39.530
you know,
little stories or anecdotes.

325
00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:43.550
Maybe I was already starting to lose a meaningful amount of,
of,
of cells,

326
00:21:43.551 --> 00:21:44.710
maybe not.
Um,

327
00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:49.670
but so 13 wouldn't have said it had any problems in my mid to late teens.
It was,

328
00:21:49.671 --> 00:21:54.590
it started to become a real nuisance kind of chip transitioning into a

329
00:21:54.591 --> 00:21:57.770
disability.
Um,
and then,
you know,

330
00:21:57.771 --> 00:22:01.970
by my early to mid twenties,
I was essentially living as,
as a blind person.

331
00:22:01.971 --> 00:22:06.260
By the time I was like 25,
um,
I had really no useful site to speak of.

332
00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:08.223
<v 3>Thank you.
Sure.</v>

333
00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:11.560
<v 1>We have another question from audience.
Sure.
Um,</v>

334
00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:15.140
it's been almost 30 years since you've been diagnosed.
In that time.

335
00:22:15.141 --> 00:22:18.800
Has there been any medical breakthroughs in this condition or is it still kind

336
00:22:18.801 --> 00:22:20.360
of have a blindness sentence?

337
00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:24.970
<v 0>Well,
first of all,
it's been 24 years.
Sorry.</v>

338
00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:28.560
Definitely older than a motion people here,
but

339
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:35.140
it's not been 30 years.
Okay.
I'm sorry,
what was question?
No,

340
00:22:35.141 --> 00:22:38.170
I'm so,
yeah,
there's been a lot of progress.
It's really actually quite,

341
00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:41.950
quite remarkable.
Um,
without boring you with all the details,

342
00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:47.730
I am convinced I will regain a substantial amount of site,

343
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:52.600
uh,
whether it's three years from now or five years or 10 years,

344
00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:57.280
who knows and how much site and how useful,

345
00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.850
who knows.
But,
um,
uh,

346
00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:05.650
I tell all those sorts of researchers that I've been lucky to get to know over

347
00:23:05.651 --> 00:23:10.180
the years that,
uh,
if I could see my kids faces,
uh,
onset,

348
00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:12.580
that's all.
That's all I need.
And,
uh,

349
00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:15.550
Dorothy has saved a lot of great pictures for me,

350
00:23:15.551 --> 00:23:17.980
so I look forward to going through all of those someday.

351
00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:20.513
<v 3>Thank you.</v>

352
00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:23.930
<v 1>Um,
I have a question for you.</v>

353
00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:28.640
So is there anything you wish you had known earlier in your life that would have

354
00:23:28.641 --> 00:23:33.200
helped at least ease your struggles a bit?
Yeah.
You know,

355
00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:36.990
<v 0>it took some time to get,
you know,</v>

356
00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:41.190
to Chris's office and there were some dark years as I mentioned,
and um,
you know,

357
00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:45.650
really call it denial or,
you know,
whatever it was,
you know,

358
00:23:45.651 --> 00:23:48.980
it would have been nicer a little earlier on and maybe start focusing on the

359
00:23:48.981 --> 00:23:53.470
practical,
immediate,
you know,
solutions to,
to,
to,

360
00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:56.680
to my day by day instead of really I'm

361
00:23:58.340 --> 00:23:59.310
insisting that,

362
00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:04.310
that my challenge began and then began and ended with the crusade for a cure.

363
00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:11.240
<v 3>Makes Sense.
Um,
do you have a question?
Okay.</v>

364
00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:17.190
<v 0>Um,
I came to your talk today because I have to confess,</v>

365
00:24:17.191 --> 00:24:19.370
I didn't know who you are until two days ago.
Um,

366
00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:23.730
and I read an op Ed that you had written,
I believe it's in the New York Times.

367
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:28.840
Um,
and you recounted an anecdote in which you were,
um,

368
00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:34.020
making coffee in,
in the kitchen and the office.
Right.

369
00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:39.090
And a woman came up to you and she said,
um,
here,
let me,
she,

370
00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:44.160
she,
she was going to sort of take over.
Yeah.
She took off her.
Right.
And you said,

371
00:24:44.161 --> 00:24:47.280
you know,
I can make coffee myself.
Thank you very much.
And she says,
sure,

372
00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:51.810
I know you can,
but you always put the grounds in the wrong bin.

373
00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:55.410
They were recycling bin.
So,
um,
and like,
you know,

374
00:24:55.411 --> 00:25:00.120
that anecdote sort of resonated with me because you know,
there are,

375
00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:05.040
you know,
we all kind of,
when we interact with people,
you know,

376
00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:08.290
perhaps there are certain set of assumptions that we hold.
Um,

377
00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:13.440
and so I think in that anecdote you,
you sort of said,
well,
you know,

378
00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.380
your assumptions were,
um,

379
00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:22.080
I guess you had this sort of realization that an assumption you had made about

380
00:25:22.081 --> 00:25:26.010
why she was intervening was perhaps wrong.
Um,

381
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.920
what would you say?

382
00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:30.490
<v 3>Okay.</v>

383
00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:35.230
<v 0>Like what other kinds of insights has,</v>

384
00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:40.170
has,
like what other,
what,

385
00:25:40.171 --> 00:25:43.780
what would you say is like,
you know,
if,

386
00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:45.820
if blindness is a gift,
what,

387
00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:50.260
what other kinds of insights would you say it has given you?

388
00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:56.670
Well,
so
the,
the,

389
00:25:57.030 --> 00:26:00.900
the insight into,
um,
our

390
00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:02.713
<v 3>mmm,</v>

391
00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:05.740
<v 0>are,
are awesome power.
I mean,</v>

392
00:26:05.741 --> 00:26:09.110
it awesome that sort of in the more literal way than the conventional,

393
00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:12.620
the conventional user,
but our power to shape our own realities.

394
00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:14.410
<v 3>Um,
uh,</v>

395
00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:20.350
<v 0>the insights that I gained into that or invaluable to me,
uh,
and,
uh,</v>

396
00:26:20.351 --> 00:26:23.610
such as had such a powerful,

397
00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:28.080
positive effect in my life.
I'll say that,

398
00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:31.290
uh,
I'm certain,
I'm convinced I'm,

399
00:26:31.291 --> 00:26:34.200
I'm passionate about the fact that this,
this vision,

400
00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:37.350
that sort of insight into the way our brains work.
It's for everybody.

401
00:26:37.351 --> 00:26:41.490
It's not about blindness.
It's not about disability.
Um,

402
00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:45.630
it's not even necessarily only about sort of challenges or obstacles in life.

403
00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.630
Uh,
it's,
it's,

404
00:26:48.631 --> 00:26:53.610
it's an opportunity to live with awareness and accountability and intention that

405
00:26:53.611 --> 00:26:57.960
has been so liberating for me and so empowering in my life that,
that,

406
00:26:57.961 --> 00:27:01.770
that's why I wrote the book.
Um,
um,
you know,

407
00:27:01.771 --> 00:27:06.150
I wrote the book really because I wanted to share this perspective with folks.

408
00:27:06.151 --> 00:27:06.481
Frankly,

409
00:27:06.481 --> 00:27:11.220
I wanted to put it down in words on paper for my children to read.

410
00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:13.410
Uh,
maybe when they get a little bit older,

411
00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:17.370
more sensible because they don't make any good decisions today

412
00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:20.790
about dot.
So,
uh,

413
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:25.710
I guess I hesitate to say sort of blindness per say is,
is the,
uh,

414
00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:29.640
is the source or those sort of the locus of the,

415
00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:32.910
of the,
uh,
the insight or the perspective.
That makes sense.

416
00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:40.710
<v 1>Cool.
Thank you so much.</v>

417
00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:46.860
What advice you would you give to people who are either going through this or

418
00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:51.910
just in general for people?
Like there are lots of fears that everyone fears,

419
00:27:51.911 --> 00:27:54.790
right?
It's not true.
It could be physical,
it could be mental,

420
00:27:54.791 --> 00:27:56.640
it could be anything.
Um,

421
00:27:56.950 --> 00:28:00.970
if you were to tell them small steps they could take,
you know,

422
00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:05.590
to get to the point where you have been at this point,
um,
what would it be?

423
00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:08.990
<v 0>Sure.
I guess if we're talking about fear specifically,
you know,
uh,</v>

424
00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:12.650
as I was saying,
you know,
focus on what,
what's,
what precisely is the problem.

425
00:28:12.651 --> 00:28:15.380
Break it down to small parts.
Focus on what you can do about it.

426
00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:19.130
Search your life for heroes and villains because a,

427
00:28:19.131 --> 00:28:22.910
they're there for they're figments,
uh,
in your mind that are,

428
00:28:22.911 --> 00:28:25.400
that can be very pernicious.
Um,

429
00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:30.220
generally I think that,
uh,
we would,

430
00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:35.250
we would all do better to pay attention to the profound difference between what

431
00:28:35.481 --> 00:28:37.810
we know and what we think we know.
Um,

432
00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:43.280
we get ourselves to a lot of trouble that with fear,
but,
um,
you know,
the,
the,

433
00:28:43.281 --> 00:28:48.281
the fear stuff and overcoming fear is obviously is a key theme in the book.

434
00:28:48.591 --> 00:28:53.000
And it's obviously what I chose to talk about today,
but really more generally.

435
00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:54.103
Um,

436
00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:59.030
it's this idea that whatever circumstances we encounter,

437
00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:00.413
<v 3>mmm,</v>

438
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.710
<v 0>what we do with them,
how we manifest them in our lives,</v>

439
00:29:03.711 --> 00:29:06.620
what we make of them is entirely within our control.

440
00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:11.630
And for me,
I need no more sort of proof of that.

441
00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:17.560
Then the fact that,
you know,
always there are people who have,
uh,

442
00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:22.280
done far more with far less and been a lot happier doing it.

443
00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:27.170
Right.
Okay.
So if that's true,
it just can't be the circumstances.

444
00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:28.063
That's the problem.

445
00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:29.313
<v 3>Right.</v>

446
00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:32.660
<v 1>Makes Sense.
Um,
thank you so much for your account.</v>

447
00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:36.560
It was wonderful having you here.
Thanks for inviting me.

448
00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:41.350
Thank you so much for coming.
Uh,
I encourage everyone to read book.

449
00:29:41.351 --> 00:29:46.060
It's very inspiring.
It's truly,
um,
it's an autobiography,

450
00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.180
yet it's very inspiring.
Um,

451
00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:51.460
I think I found it very useful and amazing to read through it.
You,

452
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.840
thank you so much for coming.
Thanks,
Ramit.

453
00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:55.360
<v 5>Okay.</v>
