WEBVTT

1
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.160
Our organization is a diversity consulting organization.

2
00:00:11.201 --> 00:00:13.350
And over the years,
uh,

3
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.360
we have actually provided leadership development for a 4,000,

4
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.860
uh,
executives and professionals of color.

5
00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.640
It's been a journey for me.
Um,

6
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.610
being at the partnership,
uh,

7
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.240
what led me to the partnership was,
um,

8
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.390
really when President Obama appointed me to be a the U s representative to the

9
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.310
United Nations for the 65th general assembly.

10
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.550
And it was a really humbling experience.

11
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.580
Each year the president has the opportunity to appoint someone outside of the

12
00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.120
State Department to be a part of the delegation.

13
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.540
And this was a role that Eleanor Roosevelt filled Coretta Scott King filled.

14
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.100
And then I had the opportunity to fill.

15
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.370
So you can imagine how humbling this experience was.

16
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.610
And when you stand up on the stage of the United Nations,

17
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.920
um,
at that iconic,
um,

18
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.993
podium,

19
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.980
and you look out amongst the sea of ambassadors,

20
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.730
it hits you that the world is primarily black and brown and yellow by the

21
00:01:44.381 --> 00:01:46.540
ambassadors that you see.

22
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.960
And so when I came back to Boston,

23
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.650
I wanted to help Boston to be more,

24
00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.800
to be more reflective of the United Nations.

25
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.310
And so I left my job at John Hancock and took on this role at the partnership as

26
00:02:07.451 --> 00:02:11.890
CEO in order to help companies advance,

27
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.170
um,
in diversity.

28
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.180
And so that's what I've been doing these last six years.

29
00:02:19.181 --> 00:02:23.440
And that's what led me to write success through diversity.

30
00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.220
Now we were talking earlier and while I might be passionate about diversity,

31
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.270
I only want to approach diversity from a business perspective.

32
00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.180
I don't want to approach it from my passion.

33
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.400
I want to approach it from why is it good for business.

34
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.270
And so thus the tagline,

35
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.600
why the most inclusive companies will win because it's about winning.

36
00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.980
So let me share with you this story.

37
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.670
Toy giant Mattel is another example of a company that catapulted it's business

38
00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:11.950
forward by appealing to a diverse marketplace.

39
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.360
For decades since its debut in 1959,

40
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.170
the Barbie doll flawlessly thin,

41
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.320
high heeled and white skinned was a cultural sensation.

42
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.560
And one of the world's best selling toys.

43
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.540
Over the years.

44
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.190
Mattel modestly diversify the toys,

45
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.340
occupations,
and ethnicities,

46
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.550
creating a Barbie businesswoman.

47
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.000
1963 a Barbie astronaut,

48
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.060
1965 an African American Barbie 67 and a Barbie surgeon.

49
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.380
73 MONTEL's efforts in Nabi enabled the doll to maintain about a 90% market

50
00:04:04.451 --> 00:04:09.451
share in girl oriented toys for most of the 20th century.

51
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.890
By the mid two thousands barbies,

52
00:04:14.891 --> 00:04:19.891
dominance and brand appeal began to lag after four straight quarters of

53
00:04:22.601 --> 00:04:24.460
plummeting cells.

54
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.980
It was no longer the best selling doll.

55
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.570
The brand was losing relevance.

56
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.740
Said Lisa McKnight's senior vice president at Mattel.

57
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.120
We knew we had to change the conversation.

58
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.790
A creative team within Mattel worked for two years.

59
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.820
Under the secretive code project,

60
00:04:51.821 --> 00:04:54.400
dawn began barbies,

61
00:04:54.401 --> 00:04:59.401
modern make-over designing a more inclusive set of dolls that more accurately

62
00:05:01.361 --> 00:05:06.361
reflected the size and complection of America's children.

63
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.260
In 2015 Mattel unleashed the fruits of project dawn,

64
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.220
launching a new generation of dolls complete with curvy body sizes.

65
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.750
23 hair colors,

66
00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.930
22 hairdos 18 I colors and an array of skin tones.

67
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.780
This product lunch Mattel's most significant rebranding effort to date has

68
00:05:42.641 --> 00:05:47.641
proven we vitalizing and lucrative parents and children alike flat to the

69
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.890
ethnically,
racially,

70
00:05:53.891 --> 00:05:57.950
and bodily diversed product lines.

71
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:03.580
Bobby became the most diverse doll product line and that the toy industry

72
00:06:05.451 --> 00:06:09.860
associations annual toy of the year awards.

73
00:06:09.861 --> 00:06:14.861
In 2017 the company won the coveted doll of the year award.

74
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.680
This new generation of barbies wouldn't have been possible without a diverse

75
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:29.790
workforce inside Mattel to help design a culturally sensitive and compelling

76
00:06:32.901 --> 00:06:35.570
black Barbie.
For example,

77
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.990
the company's marketing teams consulted with Mattel's African American forum.

78
00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:44.510
The toy makers,

79
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:49.570
African American employee resource group members help get the dolls names,

80
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:56.240
skin tone and hair just right.

81
00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.610
They asked us very candid questions about the look of the doll.

82
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.040
Did they get the skin tone right?

83
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:08.780
What about the nose and the Hare said David Simmons,

84
00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:13.840
associate manager of account planning and a member of the Erg group.

85
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:20.950
This was important because consumers roundly criticized the 1967 African

86
00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:30.611
American Barbie colored Francy for her inauthenticity.

87
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:36.110
Besides having a darker skin tone,

88
00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:41.560
she lacked any bodily features or hairstyles.

89
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:47.020
Typical of African Americans as African American,

90
00:07:47.451 --> 00:07:52.250
Tom Burrell,
a diversity advertising trailblazer.

91
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:57.460
Famously quipped black people are not dark skinned white people.

92
00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.170
A lack of authenticity.

93
00:08:03.171 --> 00:08:08.171
Plague previous Barbie diversity efforts as well with the wheelchair bound

94
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:11.300
share,
a smile.

95
00:08:11.301 --> 00:08:16.301
Becky doll 1997 lacking the correct proportions to fit into her dream house

96
00:08:19.731 --> 00:08:24.731
elevator and the computer engineer Barbie product line requiring help from boys

97
00:08:27.651 --> 00:08:29.300
to actually code.

98
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:35.170
However four it's 2016 line of Gamer Barbie's.

99
00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:41.860
Mattel drew on female engineer leaders such as Molly profit,

100
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:46.280
CEO of [inaudible] games,

101
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:51.670
Julie and crumping intertainment industry editor in chief at Google and Bryant,

102
00:08:56.670 --> 00:09:01.670
founder of black girls code to help it design a compelling doll that resembled a

103
00:09:04.951 --> 00:09:07.170
real tech Geek.

104
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:10.890
These women advise Mattel during their,

105
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:16.310
during their design process ensuring the new careers game developer Barbie was

106
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:20.700
authentic,
compelling,

107
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
and would help inspire a new generation of budding female computer scientists

108
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:29.850
and stem leaders.

109
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:36.080
The computer has java script on it and you can see various instances of game

110
00:09:38.941 --> 00:09:41.760
engines on her laptop.
Said,

111
00:09:41.761 --> 00:09:45.300
one of the leaders commenting on the new line.

112
00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:51.740
I really know the girls need an icon that shows them they can be part of the

113
00:09:52.831 --> 00:09:56.670
tech space and Barbie does that.

114
00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:02.420
She has the power to tell girls they can be makers and builders.

115
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.100
Even barbies.

116
00:10:05.101 --> 00:10:10.101
Companion can received a totally diversity may go over in 2017 prior to the new

117
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:18.720
iteration of candles,
barbies,
plastic bowl,

118
00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:23.670
typically sported,
blonde hair,
blue eyes,

119
00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:27.660
and a chiseled figure.
Revamped.

120
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:32.750
Ken comes in one case with a man bun while another sports,

121
00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:37.530
a dad bod,

122
00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:43.140
a fortune article observed all of this increased diversity has led to more

123
00:10:46.111 --> 00:10:48.330
prosperity for the company.

124
00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:54.050
Mattel's Brunette Latina Bobby with curves and Brown eyes became the company's

125
00:10:58.291 --> 00:11:03.291
2016 best seller of feet.

126
00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:09.080
The Huntington post senior reporter Emily pet calls a clear victory for the toy

127
00:11:11.521 --> 00:11:16.521
maker giant following four years of declines,

128
00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:22.250
sales of the dolls increased 7% in 2016 earning nearly a billion dollars for the

129
00:11:27.601 --> 00:11:28.440
company.

130
00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:34.340
Certainly proving that diversity selves.

131
00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:37.500
Thank you.
Thank you.

132
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:45.330
Well,
I'm so glad you shared that excerpt because it really leads into the first

133
00:11:45.331 --> 00:11:48.870
question that I wanted to ask you.
And that is as a woman of color,

134
00:11:48.871 --> 00:11:52.920
writing a book about diversity,
you took the lens of not

135
00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:57.350
<v 2>moral compass leading or anything that would say as a human being,</v>

136
00:11:57.351 --> 00:11:58.131
this makes sense.

137
00:11:58.131 --> 00:12:01.640
But you instead went the route of really highlighting why as a business,

138
00:12:01.641 --> 00:12:03.200
like you said about the Tagline,

139
00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:06.620
why it'll make you win or why it is a business case.

140
00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.470
Can you speak to why you went that route when writing?

141
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:13.610
<v 1>Because at the end of the day,
um,</v>

142
00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:18.660
we are in business and at the end of the day we want to win and we have to

143
00:12:19.301 --> 00:12:22.900
approach things from the bottom line.

144
00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.110
And so when we look at diversity,

145
00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:30.850
we want to look at the changing landscape.
Um,

146
00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:35.910
it's important for us to understand this changing demographic shift where are

147
00:12:37.451 --> 00:12:40.180
experiencing today.

148
00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:45.420
There are more babies of color born in this country than Caucasian babies today.

149
00:12:47.981 --> 00:12:52.981
There are more students of color in this country than Caucasians in 2042 the

150
00:12:56.651 --> 00:13:01.651
census bureau indicates that there will be more people of color in America than

151
00:13:03.971 --> 00:13:07.570
Caucasians.
That's all workforce.

152
00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:09.790
That's our market place.

153
00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:15.480
And so in order for us to produce goods and services for our market place and

154
00:13:18.791 --> 00:13:22.750
for our global marketplace,
I talked about the UN.

155
00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:28.770
We need to have individuals in our companies that are reflective of our

156
00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:31.060
marketplace.

157
00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:36.330
And so it only stands to reason that we want to have a diverse workforce.

158
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:41.590
And then you look at all the studies,

159
00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:46.710
you look at the Mckenzie studies that indicates the more diverse work forces are

160
00:13:48.531 --> 00:13:53.290
the more profitable workforces.
Because again,

161
00:13:53.291 --> 00:13:56.470
at the end of the day,
you want diversity of thought.

162
00:13:56.830 --> 00:14:01.830
And the best way to get diversity of thought is to have people not only with

163
00:14:02.111 --> 00:14:07.111
different experiences but different cultures and who can add a different lens to

164
00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:14.470
a problem.
And so diversity is critical.

165
00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:20.160
There's a new study that came out that said that the more innovative companies,

166
00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:26.920
the companies that are more diverse,
are big,

167
00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:30.070
are the more innovative companies,

168
00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:35.520
the more innovative companies are producing more patents.

169
00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:37.900
And when they did the studies,

170
00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:41.500
those innovative companies with a diverse companies,

171
00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:45.940
the more diverse companies produce more innovative companies,

172
00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:48.340
the more patents and received more patents.

173
00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:50.960
<v 2>I definitely can believe that.
And I'm sure you,</v>

174
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:55.220
Google's goal is to be among the most innovative companies.
Absolutely.

175
00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:56.480
To be on the cutting edge.

176
00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.260
So then the next question I have for you stems off of that same thought.

177
00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.690
If I know there's some folks in the room that are actually on our like

178
00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:04.670
recruiting teams,

179
00:15:04.671 --> 00:15:09.671
but a lot of this office in particular don't really have a touch point with our

180
00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:14.120
recruiting or hiring an HR teams heavily engineering.

181
00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:18.470
How would you say for those who are interested in kind of seeing the needle move

182
00:15:18.471 --> 00:15:22.400
here but don't really work in a role where they can directly hire,

183
00:15:22.401 --> 00:15:25.910
let's say more diverse talent to get us that innovation that you were speaking

184
00:15:25.911 --> 00:15:26.510
about?

185
00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:31.250
How can we still kind of show our passion for this or try to make some progress

186
00:15:31.251 --> 00:15:31.941
on the topic,

187
00:15:31.941 --> 00:15:35.510
although it's not necessarily a part of our like core roles here at Google.

188
00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.740
<v 1>It is a part of your car roles.
Um,</v>

189
00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:43.790
and it's important for you to understand how much influence millennials have

190
00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.153
today.

191
00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:52.400
There are more millennials than baby boomers and corporate understands that

192
00:15:53.551 --> 00:15:58.551
millennials are our leaders and our future leaders.

193
00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:04.220
And your voice is incredibly powerful and corporate and executives understand

194
00:16:06.901 --> 00:16:11.901
that millennials think differently and understand that you have a lot of options

195
00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:19.280
and they understand that you care deeply about values and that a company has to

196
00:16:23.011 --> 00:16:25.890
have ethics and values.

197
00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:28.890
And if you say this is important,

198
00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:33.370
it becomes important to the company.
Um,

199
00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:38.280
I can give you an example.
Um,
Charlottesville,

200
00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:39.180
um,

201
00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:44.180
occurred and there were a number of companies where the CEO wrote a letter to

202
00:16:47.341 --> 00:16:51.000
their employee population is saying,

203
00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:55.530
this is not who we are.
We condemn this.

204
00:16:56.730 --> 00:17:00.810
And as we,
certainly a six months ago,

205
00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:06.320
I was speaking to a HR executive,

206
00:17:07.090 --> 00:17:11.880
um,
here in Boston and they said to me,
you know,

207
00:17:11.881 --> 00:17:16.881
we still are feeling the effects of not coming out and saying something at

208
00:17:20.581 --> 00:17:21.570
Charlottesville.

209
00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:27.060
And so your voice is important.

210
00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:30.270
And so employees,
if,

211
00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:34.200
if diversity is important to you and it is,

212
00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:39.540
millennials are far more diverse than baby boomers.

213
00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:43.560
It's what you know,
um,

214
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:48.590
you don't want to be living and working in a society where there is just one of,

215
00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:56.130
of any kind.
You value diversity.

216
00:17:56.610 --> 00:18:00.540
You are really stimulated by it.

217
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:06.170
And so if you say this is important for your growth and development,

218
00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:13.920
your executive management will respond to that.

219
00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:19.760
And so I would say give voice to this and say it is important for you and that

220
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:29.470
it is something you are willing to step up and help take responsibility for and

221
00:18:32.191 --> 00:18:37.191
help be on teams to help increase the diversity of your organization.

222
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.290
We can accept that charge.

223
00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.940
<v 2>That's a really good idea.</v>

224
00:18:42.941 --> 00:18:47.650
I know that one reason a lot of times we see that women of color or women in

225
00:18:47.651 --> 00:18:52.450
general or any underrepresented minority maybe is not seeing progressing through

226
00:18:52.451 --> 00:18:56.230
corporate America as quickly is due to unconscious bias and use that we may hold

227
00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.840
and Google has,
like I think many companies,

228
00:18:58.841 --> 00:19:03.430
we have an unconscious unconscious bias training that all employees have to
take.

229
00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:07.480
Um,
but I know that you've actually spoken out saying that you don't necessarily

230
00:19:07.481 --> 00:19:11.590
believe in having a mandatory unconscious bias training.

231
00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:14.530
Can you speak to why that is and what might work better?

232
00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:15.770
<v 1>Well,</v>

233
00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:20.770
I don't personally want to go to a class called unconscious bias.

234
00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:27.170
You know,
I think that the term makes you feel,
it puts you,

235
00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:28.550
makes you tense.

236
00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:34.100
And so I do want to go to a forum,

237
00:19:34.101 --> 00:19:35.930
a class,
um,

238
00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:41.020
on leading for the future and that's what we call our forums at the partnership,

239
00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:46.850
you know,
leading for the future.
Um,
and so we talk about,

240
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.360
you know,
what does that look like?
You know,

241
00:19:50.361 --> 00:19:52.610
what does the population look like?

242
00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:55.910
What are the technologies going to look like?

243
00:19:55.911 --> 00:19:59.180
There is so much change.
Um,

244
00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:04.010
and because there is so much change,

245
00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:09.880
what would get in the way of US accepting this change?

246
00:20:11.091 --> 00:20:15.290
And so we begin to peel back the onion that way.

247
00:20:15.291 --> 00:20:18.170
And that's how we get at unconscious bias.

248
00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:23.470
But I find uncomfortable going to a session called unconscious bias.

249
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:29.710
I much rather go to a session called leading for the future because all of us

250
00:20:30.621 --> 00:20:34.400
want to be good leaders.
And then we find out,
okay,

251
00:20:34.401 --> 00:20:38.360
well what might get in the way of us being a good leader?

252
00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:44.170
And something that gets in the way of us being a good leader is this unconscious

253
00:20:44.451 --> 00:20:46.910
bias,
which we all have.

254
00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:52.890
And one of the things that I always do is in this leading for the future forum

255
00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.690
is I tell people of mine bias.

256
00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:03.880
When I walked into the partnership,
the partnership had all women.

257
00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:07.090
And I love being a woman.

258
00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:12.840
And so the personal side of me was most comfortable,

259
00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.590
uh,
with that.

260
00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:19.030
But I also knew that

261
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:25.390
I was missing something from an organizational standpoint.

262
00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:29.800
And so my first few hires were men.

263
00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:34.780
And my culture shifted in the organization.

264
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:36.400
It expanded.

265
00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:40.900
We had perspectives that were not there.

266
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:46.590
And so my organization was better because we opened up the organization so that

267
00:21:49.721 --> 00:21:51.400
it was more diverse.

268
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000
And while we're an organization that focuses on ethnic diversity,

269
00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:04.290
we have individuals who are white who work in our organization because I don't

270
00:22:06.731 --> 00:22:11.440
want to have one of any kind.
Um,

271
00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:15.520
I want our organization to be reflective of the world,

272
00:22:15.521 --> 00:22:20.521
to be reflective of organizations and we're going to build together.

273
00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:26.200
Um,
so,
uh,
unconscious bias first,

274
00:22:26.201 --> 00:22:31.201
let's think about why and who we are and what our own biases are and let's check

275
00:22:33.881 --> 00:22:37.990
them at the door before we come into the organization.

276
00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:42.880
<v 2>I love that you should teach our unconscious bias training and we can take,</v>

277
00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:46.690
you can tell us that that was,
that was really,
um,
thoughtful.

278
00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:48.460
Thank you for sharing that.

279
00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:52.510
I know that you were speaking about your goals for the partnership and your

280
00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:56.140
employees and what you would like to see reflected there.

281
00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:58.240
We as a company,

282
00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:02.860
and I'm sure many companies are also trying to diversify the pipeline and make

283
00:23:02.861 --> 00:23:07.030
sure that we've got talent coming in.
But a lot of times folks say,
well,

284
00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:08.020
there's just not there.

285
00:23:08.021 --> 00:23:12.460
We're looking for this role and we're not seeing a lot of minority groups

286
00:23:12.461 --> 00:23:15.340
represented for this specific role or job.

287
00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:19.090
What do you say to that and how would you challenge folks to,

288
00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:21.280
to resolve that issue for their company?

289
00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:26.360
<v 1>Well,
first of all,
let me tell you that I don't use the word minority.
Okay.</v>

290
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:28.520
Because in the world,

291
00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:33.590
people of color and not the minority in Boston,
uh,

292
00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:38.650
people of color are 54% of the population.

293
00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:41.060
So we're not the minority.

294
00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:44.840
So I call us people of color rather than,

295
00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:49.490
and the word minority has a certain connotation as well.

296
00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:54.500
So I use the word people of color.
Um,

297
00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:59.150
so I encourage people to do that,
uh,
as well.

298
00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:00.133
Um,

299
00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:05.290
and I encouraged people to move beyond the traditional recruiting,

300
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:08.150
um,
sources.

301
00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:13.730
We have 4,000 individuals who have been through the partnership training

302
00:24:14.331 --> 00:24:17.390
programs.
Next month,

303
00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:21.590
Carmen will be training over 250.

304
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:23.780
I think you have starting,

305
00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:29.770
there are people who are in our greater Boston area.

306
00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:32.510
Um,

307
00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:36.980
you have to look beyond the traditional sources.

308
00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.950
You went to Howard University,

309
00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:45.550
there is a Howard University alumni chapter here in Boston.

310
00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:51.320
If that's a great place to start here at the partnership,

311
00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:54.860
we've created a job board,
um,

312
00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:59.890
for companies who want to be able to advertise their jobs through us because

313
00:25:02.811 --> 00:25:04.490
individuals,
no,

314
00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:09.700
it's that people who are advertising a on the partnerships,

315
00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:14.330
job board website really value diversity.

316
00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:15.620
Um,

317
00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:20.620
so there are ways that you can approach and find and we source people of color.

318
00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:28.930
One of the strategies that I mentioned in the book is the Rooney rule.

319
00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:34.780
And that is to say that when you have a job open,

320
00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:36.950
um,

321
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:41.950
to ensure that you into view diverse talent,

322
00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:47.120
you don't feel that job unless you have a diverse pool.

323
00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:51.590
Now,
we're not telling you to hire a diverse talent,

324
00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:56.690
but we're telling you to make sure that the pool is diverse.

325
00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:00.260
And this rule comes,
uh,

326
00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:05.440
from the NFL when they tried to increase diversity amongst,

327
00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:10.580
uh,
their coaches.
And,
uh,

328
00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:13.430
it just so happened,
uh,

329
00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:17.940
that they were at its peak when one super bowl,
uh,

330
00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:23.080
they had two African Americans playing against each other,

331
00:26:23.151 --> 00:26:25.430
two coaches.
Um,

332
00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:30.260
but for a long time there was no coaches,
uh,

333
00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:35.120
uh,
African American.
Now we still have a long way to go and you know,

334
00:26:35.121 --> 00:26:37.640
we still have a long way to go with the NFL,

335
00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:43.900
but the Rooney rule is really an opportunity for us to ensure our pools are

336
00:26:46.501 --> 00:26:50.400
diverse.
Managers can select whomever,

337
00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:55.730
but at least we're seeing when we're being intentional about seeing candidates

338
00:26:56.791 --> 00:26:59.490
of color.
That makes a lot of sense.

339
00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:03.890
I know that there are some folks in the audience who might also have questions.

340
00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:08.630
<v 3>Hey,
thank you so much.
Hi.
The excerpt was excellent.</v>

341
00:27:08.631 --> 00:27:11.210
I'm really excited to read the rest.
Thank you.

342
00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:14.570
And there was wondering what were some of the biggest challenges for you in

343
00:27:14.571 --> 00:27:15.500
writing this book?

344
00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:19.640
<v 1>Oh,
that's a great question.
Um,</v>

345
00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:22.250
well I think the,

346
00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:27.340
some of the biggest challenges were finding

347
00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:35.140
companies that had really excelled and were exceptional.

348
00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:40.430
Um,

349
00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:45.430
and I was able to find hallmark health who had used the Rooney little and seeing

350
00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:53.120
their profits go up.

351
00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:55.790
So it's one thing to use the Rooney rule,

352
00:27:55.791 --> 00:27:59.180
but I want it to be able to relate that to profitability.

353
00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:01.730
And so an interviewing their CEO,

354
00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:05.870
they attributed that to their profitability.

355
00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:09.890
So I was glad to see that.
And then,
um,

356
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:12.880
the other challenge,
uh,

357
00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:18.040
was to be able to find a c e o s who would be able to indicate what they did

358
00:28:26.421 --> 00:28:31.421
wrong and none of us want to indicate what we did wrong.

359
00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:35.900
And so those were the biggest challenges.
But that's a great question.

360
00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:37.423
So thank you.

361
00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:41.240
<v 3>Are there,
thanks for coming today.
Um,
I do,</v>

362
00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:43.980
I was curious as you were doing your research,

363
00:28:43.981 --> 00:28:48.981
was there a certain industry that excels in this area and if they do excel in

364
00:28:49.321 --> 00:28:54.180
this area,
are they as equally successful in retention as well as recruiting?
Uh,

365
00:28:54.181 --> 00:28:56.520
other things that we can learn from other industries that might be doing it

366
00:28:56.521 --> 00:28:59.670
better than ours.
Yeah.
And along those lines,

367
00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:03.470
if they are successful in the recruiting methods,
um,

368
00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:06.690
is there something they partner with retention methods as well that helps them

369
00:29:06.691 --> 00:29:08.340
be successful?
Yeah,

370
00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:13.170
<v 1>I found that the finance,
finance industry,
um,</v>

371
00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:17.950
is particularly good at it because I'm there had been doing it a long a period

372
00:29:17.951 --> 00:29:20.770
of time.
Number one.
Um,

373
00:29:21.010 --> 00:29:25.900
and recruiting is certainly linked to we tension.
Um,

374
00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:31.020
and there's one finance company that has 27 e r g e s in their organizations.

375
00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:36.790
Do you know what Erg is?

376
00:29:36.791 --> 00:29:40.780
Our employee resource groups 27.

377
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:45.430
So they have a resource group for every difference.

378
00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:51.120
So people feel valued there and that they um,

379
00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:55.660
can um,
there are differences valued.

380
00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:59.410
It's supported by their company.
Um,

381
00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:00.940
and that um,

382
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.060
they think twice about leaving because he,

383
00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:09.820
our gs are really a core part of the business.

384
00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:13.500
The other thing that I found is that he,

385
00:30:13.501 --> 00:30:18.501
our genes are merging or moving towards business resource groups.

386
00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:24.610
So the,
the Mattel story.
So it's just not an Erg.

387
00:30:24.611 --> 00:30:29.611
Now that companies are using the Er gs as business resource groups and they are

388
00:30:32.351 --> 00:30:36.340
being valued even more and being brought into the business.

389
00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:41.520
And that's really helpful for employees and it's helpful for companies as well.

390
00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:47.370
Great question.
I actually have one more question.
Please

391
00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:51.470
<v 3>find that there's any particular or whether it be finance or another industry or</v>

392
00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:56.480
company that's really skilled at upward mobility for people of color.

393
00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:00.200
Um,
I said it's something we talk about all the time.

394
00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:03.350
I sit on the university programs seem when we do a university recruiting and so

395
00:31:03.351 --> 00:31:07.520
forth,
then we control so much of the student's experience on campus.
Um,

396
00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:12.730
and like we want to make sure that we want to set them up for success wherever

397
00:31:12.741 --> 00:31:14.690
they go.
So whether they ended up at Google or that end up somewhere else,

398
00:31:14.691 --> 00:31:16.640
you wanna make sure they're having a good experience and that when they get

399
00:31:16.641 --> 00:31:20.120
there they can really flourish.
Um,
so there's a lot of companies I can imagine.

400
00:31:20.121 --> 00:31:22.300
I do pretty well recruiting and retaining,
um,

401
00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:26.270
but don't necessarily see people of color moving up at the same rate as other

402
00:31:26.271 --> 00:31:28.820
folks.
Are there any companies that you've noticed through your research that are

403
00:31:28.821 --> 00:31:30.980
really good at promoting upward mobility for people of Color?

404
00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:32.071
<v 1>Uh,</v>

405
00:31:32.071 --> 00:31:37.071
the company that in Boston that I think does it best as eastern bank and that's

406
00:31:39.211 --> 00:31:43.440
because of the executive leadership of that company.

407
00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:48.810
Um,
so Bob rivers is the chairman and CEO,

408
00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:51.840
um,
and um,

409
00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:55.110
is actually named after Robert Kennedy.

410
00:31:55.560 --> 00:32:00.560
And so takes the issue of diversity and inclusion very personally,

411
00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:07.950
um,
and show specifically one,

412
00:32:07.951 --> 00:32:10.950
expanding the business,

413
00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:16.160
chose to expand in areas like Lawrence and low and was able to make the business

414
00:32:19.231 --> 00:32:24.231
case for moving into those socio economic depressed areas and,

415
00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:31.000
and bill those areas and make money.
Um,

416
00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:33.990
in that company,

417
00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:39.230
the chair of the board is an African American woman and then she succeeded an

418
00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:45.530
African American male chair.

419
00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:48.200
Bob's successor,

420
00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:53.680
the vice chair of the board and president is an African American male.

421
00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:57.830
Um,
when he started,

422
00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:03.250
90% of the board was white male and now 50% of the board are women people of

423
00:33:10.941 --> 00:33:15.080
color or LGBT.
Um,

424
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:20.230
and that is then that attracts a whole set of people who want to be able to work

425
00:33:24.501 --> 00:33:29.501
for a company because the culture has shifted.

426
00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:31.940
So at the end of the day,

427
00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:35.000
what is happening with diversity?

428
00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:39.120
It's all about culture.
And you,

429
00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:44.160
you have to create a culture where differences valued were not diff.

430
00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:49.370
We're differences not tolerated.

431
00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:54.910
Where your difference is an asset where you are difference is valued and can be

432
00:33:57.651 --> 00:34:01.700
seen as a business value.

433
00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:05.300
And that is why people will stay.

434
00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:09.830
And so when you are bringing in these students,
you,

435
00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:14.420
and if you don't have it,
if you don't have it all together,

436
00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:17.780
you ask them for their health.
You say,

437
00:34:17.781 --> 00:34:21.980
here's where we want to be and we're not here yet,

438
00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:27.520
but we need your help and help us get there,

439
00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:32.750
empower them to help shape your culture.

440
00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:38.250
<v 3>Thank you for coming.
Um,
it sounds like uh,
the,</v>

441
00:34:38.251 --> 00:34:40.810
the book and a lot of your work is in the business context.

442
00:34:40.811 --> 00:34:44.080
I'm definitely super interested in reading it.
I'm curious though,

443
00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:49.030
to what degree you've run into similar issues in other domains like politics for

444
00:34:49.031 --> 00:34:52.350
example,
if you have any stories or research,
uh,

445
00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:54.700
that might not be included in the book that you could share about that

446
00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:56.770
<v 1>in terms of,</v>

447
00:34:57.140 --> 00:35:01.690
<v 3>in terms of the value of diversity and,
and the way it can benefit,
uh,</v>

448
00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:04.520
countries are political systems in addition to businesses.

449
00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:09.410
<v 1>Oh,
um,
well,
yeah,
that's who I am.</v>

450
00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:13.710
Yes.
Well,
the world is changing.
Um,

451
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:16.310
and so it's so important,
uh,

452
00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:19.130
for us to be accepting.

453
00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:24.160
We look at our country and it's really important for us to understand that the

454
00:35:26.121 --> 00:35:30.170
landscape and the demographics of our country,

455
00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:35.510
it's shifting and it's important that we accept that.

456
00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.390
Um,

457
00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:42.090
and that we understand that at the end of the day,

458
00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:45.990
everyone in this country is an immigrant.

459
00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:51.420
Everyone comes from that background.
Um,
and that,

460
00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:52.793
um,

461
00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:58.310
we need to not hold on to power,

462
00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:05.190
but we need to open the door for others.

463
00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:06.390
Um,

464
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:11.390
just as others have opened the door for us when we came.

465
00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:17.220
And that's the challenge we're experiencing now in our country.

466
00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:18.433
Um,

467
00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:24.020
that there are so many who are fearful of the change,

468
00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:29.720
the changing demographics and one things to remain the same,

469
00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:36.300
but they're not going to remain the same.
The numbers are changing.

470
00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:41.720
And so it is best for us to look at the advantages that diversity brings as

471
00:36:44.911 --> 00:36:48.180
opposed to fear.
It,
um,

472
00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:53.390
look at the advantages of what different cultures bring to this country.

473
00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:59.500
It's who we are,
um,

474
00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:04.730
and not fear the change that is coming.

475
00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:05.880
Um,

476
00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:10.880
and understand that if we continue to resist,

477
00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:15.660
the rest of the world is going to pass us by.

478
00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:21.560
And so it's so important that we focus on the best side of us and not our fears.

479
00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:28.840
<v 4>So I'm recently,
um,</v>

480
00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:32.960
I live in the city of Boston and I'm in the process of enrolling my kids into

481
00:37:32.961 --> 00:37:35.090
the,
um,
you know,
into a school system.

482
00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:39.530
And what I noticed was I was attending a few sessions on various programs,

483
00:37:39.531 --> 00:37:41.680
but Boston public schools have a,

484
00:37:41.681 --> 00:37:45.470
a graduation high school graduation rate in the 60s.

485
00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:49.070
And so you take a look around at the Boston public school system and it's

486
00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:50.480
largely a lot of,

487
00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:53.870
I know you don't like the word minorities is usually a lot of people of color

488
00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:56.630
that have no other option.
But the public school system,

489
00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:59.540
which I think a lot of people agree is largely broken.

490
00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:03.770
And I think in order for,
you know,
for people to have color,

491
00:38:03.771 --> 00:38:06.650
to have the same opportunities to get into companies that,
you know,

492
00:38:06.651 --> 00:38:10.100
like Google or like the banks you're talking about that have all these
resources,

493
00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:14.510
they need to be exposed to kind of that environment and that as a path for,

494
00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:17.750
you know,
when they grow up,
this is what you can have a career in.

495
00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:20.030
And I feel like if,
you know,

496
00:38:20.031 --> 00:38:24.140
if we have something like a 60% graduation rate in the Boston public schools,

497
00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:28.470
it just doesn't seem like it doesn't,
there's no funnel of talent.
Um,

498
00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:30.170
kind of at least in the city of Boston.

499
00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:33.680
And so I guess I was wondering if you had any thoughts of,
you know,
I know you,

500
00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:37.330
a lot of your work has been with companies,
but how can we,
you know,
as you know,

501
00:38:37.331 --> 00:38:41.830
as a larger company in Boston area,
how can we help,
um,

502
00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:44.480
improve that graduation,
high school graduation rate?

503
00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:48.620
<v 1>Um,
well first of all,
the,
as you know,</v>

504
00:38:48.621 --> 00:38:51.230
this is the educational Mecca of the world.

505
00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:56.920
And so there should be no reason why we should have that weight.

506
00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:01.003
Um,

507
00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:06.370
but what we need to do as corporations is to partner with our public school

508
00:39:08.701 --> 00:39:12.950
systems,
partner with,
uh,
our city halls,
uh,

509
00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:17.120
to help,
uh,
address the issues,
uh,

510
00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:21.680
to help because this is our future workforce.
Um,

511
00:39:21.681 --> 00:39:24.100
so we would just that,
um,

512
00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:29.140
biogen the other day and they have this wonderful community lab where they have,

513
00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:35.990
um,
students coming in and they had teaching students science.

514
00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:41.310
But this is a real opportunity to take students and bring them into companies so

515
00:39:42.561 --> 00:39:47.561
that they can learn and can see that they can work here too.

516
00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:52.190
There are a number of different programs,

517
00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:57.400
but I do believe each company should be engaged in the community and have

518
00:40:00.501 --> 00:40:05.501
programs connected to the public school system because that just makes good

519
00:40:06.951 --> 00:40:08.740
business sense.
Uh,

520
00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:13.490
so whether it's adopt a school or whether it's,
you know,

521
00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:17.330
going across industry and,
um,

522
00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:21.550
teaching across,
um,
the school system.
Uh,

523
00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:26.710
but we need to realize this is our future and we won't succeed as a business

524
00:40:27.801 --> 00:40:32.030
community with an uneducated,

525
00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:37.310
um,
workforce in a public system.

526
00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:43.050
<v 2>So I know that a lot of times when people are going into some of the biggest,</v>

527
00:40:43.051 --> 00:40:46.290
most celebratory moments or moments,

528
00:40:46.291 --> 00:40:48.450
they'd become ones that they're most proud of.
For me,
I'm,

529
00:40:48.451 --> 00:40:52.590
I'm reflecting on your time at the UN General Assembly.

530
00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:53.950
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

531
00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:56.920
<v 2>Those are proceeded by things that maybe are a little more challenging or you</v>

532
00:40:56.921 --> 00:41:00.190
don't know that that's coming and you can be kind of going through a time of

533
00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:01.360
either,
um,

534
00:41:01.361 --> 00:41:05.710
complacency and what you've been doing or trying to switch user change gears.

535
00:41:05.711 --> 00:41:08.590
I know as folks trying to move through corporate America,

536
00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:11.290
folks can be in jobs for a while and then,
you know,

537
00:41:11.291 --> 00:41:15.010
kind of get antsy for that next big thing or that next large opportunity that

538
00:41:15.011 --> 00:41:15.640
can become me.

539
00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:20.110
And your career has been full of very large opportunities and really amazing

540
00:41:20.111 --> 00:41:24.070
work.
Has it ever been a time when you were going into something and you didn't

541
00:41:24.071 --> 00:41:27.760
necessarily see your way or weren't aware that that was that next big thing was

542
00:41:27.761 --> 00:41:30.110
coming?
And how did you navigate that,
um,

543
00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:33.770
stage before the time where you were moving into the next big thing?

544
00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:39.170
<v 1>You always create opportunities,
you know,
you never wait,</v>

545
00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:43.130
um,
for anything.
Um,

546
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:47.720
you put yourself in creative environments like this,

547
00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:50.320
you'll always,
um,

548
00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:55.690
think of ways to open doors for the next generation.

549
00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:57.050
Um,

550
00:41:57.050 --> 00:42:02.050
you come up with creative ideas to bring along others.

551
00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:05.210
I'm so cognizant that,
you know,

552
00:42:05.211 --> 00:42:09.890
so many people fought and died and sacrificed.

553
00:42:10.270 --> 00:42:15.020
Um,
so that I could be sitting here so that you could be sitting there.

554
00:42:15.021 --> 00:42:20.021
So my job is so small compared to what others have done for me.

555
00:42:21.711 --> 00:42:25.220
So there's always work to do.

556
00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:28.820
And we all have a responsibility to

557
00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:33.380
develop the next generation of leaders.

558
00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:36.200
And that requires a lot of work,

559
00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:40.100
whether it's the Boston public school system,

560
00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:44.750
which is something you are focusing on,
or whether it's developing,

561
00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:50.100
um,
leaders that are c suite level in the partnership.
Um,

562
00:42:50.530 --> 00:42:53.960
but you never wait for anything.

563
00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:56.420
You always focusing,

564
00:42:56.900 --> 00:43:01.900
you are always focused on building and developing because others fought and died

565
00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:10.220
so that we could be sitting here and we have a job to do.

566
00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:14.180
Thank you all for your time and thank you again.
Thank you.
Thank you.
