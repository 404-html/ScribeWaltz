1
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.340
Welcome to talk to actually get off first.

2
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.900
It's tough in the air and delighted to introduce our PR group.

3
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.790
Morning,
how are you my book?
As you can see behind the smoke 10 right?

4
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.500
Positives to promote your business.

5
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.000
Basically it's gears to people in the small to medium size enterprises.

6
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.100
It's really teaching them how to promote their business by using PR tunes.

7
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.120
So all of the tools in the RP or tools I thought I'm like again by trying to get

8
00:00:40.181 --> 00:00:42.280
us to agree on what PR actually is.

9
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.580
An awful lot of people think bureaus free advertising,
you don't remove it.

10
00:00:45.581 --> 00:00:50.170
You know advertising gives them free
advertising,
you buy the space,

11
00:00:50.171 --> 00:00:53.230
you've put something in and and the purpose of advertising is to sell a product

12
00:00:53.231 --> 00:00:57.040
so it works and what doesn't work on the basis of how much product did you
shift?

13
00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.380
It's very easy to analyze.
Public Relations on the other hand creates stories.

14
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.250
It tells you who people are and what they do and why the passion about the

15
00:01:06.251 --> 00:01:08.080
business and why you should actually invest in them.

16
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.720
I often think public relations people are like,

17
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.450
I like doctors cause they work from a goodie bag with a goody bag,

18
00:01:14.451 --> 00:01:19.120
has loads of tools and you go to a doctor and you have a cough.
The Dr. May say,

19
00:01:19.121 --> 00:01:22.780
do you mark?
Is it then it's no big deal.
You need a cough bottle.

20
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.040
The doctor weighed equally look at you and say,
Oh okay,

21
00:01:27.041 --> 00:01:28.690
I need you to get x rays.

22
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.840
Last time I heard somebody in the contract that I never saw them a second time

23
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.860
or the Dr. May way I look at you and say,
you run the,

24
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.640
or there's nothing wrong with you,
go back to work.

25
00:01:36.641 --> 00:01:37.810
I'm not getting you a certificate.

26
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.390
But he dips into a Gucci bag of tools and says,

27
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.540
here's what you need your people to do exactly the same thing.

28
00:01:43.541 --> 00:01:45.220
So we look at a business and we say,
okay,

29
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.090
if you were trying to communicate with people,
which tool do you need to use?

30
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.710
So should you be using exhibitions?
Is An easy,
should you be using social media?

31
00:01:53.711 --> 00:01:56.500
Should you be using,
um,
sponsorship?

32
00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.160
What's the tool that would work best for each different audience?

33
00:02:00.161 --> 00:02:02.080
Cause you won't reach everybody you can say too.

34
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.040
So this book is about 10 of the tools that I believe are most relevant to people

35
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.470
in SMEs.
Before I move on to the money for that.

36
00:02:11.471 --> 00:02:14.860
You mentioned the word spin because every time you hear the word public

37
00:02:14.861 --> 00:02:16.870
relations,
you hear spin on PR.

38
00:02:16.871 --> 00:02:21.260
People have this huge thing about when we do not spend,
we are not spin.

39
00:02:21.261 --> 00:02:25.580
Doctors were in public relations.
I was introduced to by two,

40
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.310
three or four years ago as the princess of the dark art of spin.

41
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.140
I absolutely adored.

42
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.350
I am dying though ever since because I think that is exactly what we do is do

43
00:02:37.761 --> 00:02:42.700
it.
People do.
I wore a suit this morning.
I'm serious about being an Auger.
I spit.

44
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.650
I could've come in in a pair of jeans.

45
00:02:44.651 --> 00:02:46.730
You would've had an entirely different visions,
visual spin.

46
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.140
You chose to dress exactly the way you chose this morning because it says

47
00:02:50.141 --> 00:02:51.790
something about you,
the mood you're in.

48
00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.930
Why don't you want to project to people in the world today.
That's been,

49
00:02:55.931 --> 00:03:00.600
that's a visual spin.
We also do it by sort of two ways it has been.

50
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.331
One is visually.

51
00:03:01.331 --> 00:03:05.110
So what you look at says something about it creates an expectation,

52
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.050
but equally texts does the same thing.
Let me give you an example.

53
00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:11.590
If I said that my best friend,

54
00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.760
<v 1>okay,</v>

55
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.660
<v 0>is a drug addict,</v>

56
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.030
what immediately comes into your head or just drug addicts said,

57
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.440
Phil's takes drugs.

58
00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.140
That Domino's not really the best and probably in a bad place right now,

59
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.630
uh,
needs to feed the habit.

60
00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:37.600
So God only knows how they actually get enough money to feed the habit.

61
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.770
The whole drug addicts,
just the use of boards.
Drug addict says,
hmm,

62
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.330
I wouldn't have thought she had,
she associated with those kinds of people.

63
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.610
If on the other hand,
I said,

64
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.990
my best friend is a recreational user.
You Go,
whoa.

65
00:03:52.991 --> 00:03:57.750
Too many parties,
we're gonna come back and that stuff,
it'll kill your venture.

66
00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:02.110
You some hold different spin.
You're still talking about somebody who uses drugs,

67
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.290
but it's the spin.
It's a text who will spin your head,

68
00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:08.200
creates a different picture.
And that's what PR people do.
And they say,

69
00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:11.620
don't look over there.
Look over here.
That's what's been is about,

70
00:04:11.621 --> 00:04:12.790
it's not about telling a lie,

71
00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:16.920
it's about diverting your attention just a little bit.
So visualist fit.

72
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.930
Let me go get four off the 10 rent hot tips possibly that are included in this

73
00:04:22.181 --> 00:04:25.790
book.
Visual phobic calls,
and we live in a visual.

74
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.490
It looks at the way we watch news and the way news is presented to us how it's

75
00:04:30.491 --> 00:04:34.410
changed in the last 10 or 15 years.
If you don't do news years ago,

76
00:04:34.411 --> 00:04:37.870
it was one person sitting to a camera on television saying,
here is the news,

77
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.630
and you had a kid behind.
If you watch news on television,

78
00:04:40.631 --> 00:04:43.950
now you've got all of these boxes coming down the side with short and breaking.

79
00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.750
This is abused.
You've got ticker tape running underneath.

80
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.630
Nobody actually sits there and waits for the next story.

81
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.550
We have no patients of the visual tells us something.
It's like,
I've seen,

82
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.050
um,
this morning who was an avalanche initially,
I've seen the avalanche.

83
00:04:59.051 --> 00:05:01.480
I know what happened.
It's a visual kind of thing.

84
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.510
If you can create a really good visual,

85
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.860
people will remember they associated with your business and there are two ways

86
00:05:08.861 --> 00:05:11.380
to do it with,
one is by phone call and one is by photo shoot.

87
00:05:11.381 --> 00:05:14.950
Photo call is where you actually invited all of the media to attend and you set

88
00:05:14.951 --> 00:05:19.090
up the picture from photo shoots where you create the photograph and you send it

89
00:05:19.091 --> 00:05:22.290
to the media.
So let me give you an example of,
oh we did a phone,

90
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.200
I must warn you in advance.
Small liquor people vertically challenged,

91
00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:29.440
generally called children.
I don't have any of them.
I find that fairly dense

92
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.070
text.
You realize this story.

93
00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:36.430
So I regard them with very few challenged until they're my hype and make eye

94
00:05:36.431 --> 00:05:39.220
contact and speak and 40 form sentences.
They're like,
nice to meet you,

95
00:05:39.221 --> 00:05:43.110
good to move on.
So I'm doing this photo call on them.

96
00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.550
It's for the opening of a school,
it's against goal.

97
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.940
And I have two children photographer sitting beside me and he says,
okay,

98
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.910
what I want to get is that traditional shop.
I want to get a little boy,

99
00:05:51.911 --> 00:05:55.600
little girl holding hands walking at school.
They want to come easy.

100
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.710
I told you I've no kids,
so I just want me to,

101
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.550
that there's a void there that we keep around there.
So yeah,
they were patching.

102
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.010
Nice.
Shawn,
do me a favorite home Morin's time pays.
Yeah.

103
00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.000
Maureen hold Sean's handpiece

104
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.400
and she puts her hand and he goes,
I'm not Julie.

105
00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.380
Hey,
we go through this about two or three times.
I said,

106
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.640
jobs like this kid has an attitude problem.

107
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:28.760
He said,
no,
we're not going to get the shot.
I said,
no,
no,
we got the shop.

108
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.360
I just need to lose charge.
Okay.
So without even thinking of a,

109
00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:33.740
but now I'm in the zone,

110
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:38.060
so I've heard about the said who wants to do the board talk with turns back to

111
00:06:38.061 --> 00:06:43.061
me and went owns [inaudible] going to record this.

112
00:06:44.361 --> 00:06:48.990
I'm filling,
somebody's just going to a child and this father can

113
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.420
and
I still have with reading register.
Fuck.
The photographer said.

114
00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.510
So I said,
wait,
do me and say,

115
00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.550
what do you just talk for is trying to get a shot to the Irish times,

116
00:07:01.551 --> 00:07:04.190
the Kimble cooperate.
I just wanted to hold her.
You won't do it.

117
00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.600
Sorry that that kid had his chance.
He's gone.
I need,

118
00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:13.970
I don't do tactical library.
What was the focus reaction?

119
00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:19.120
Any idea
to

120
00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:21.603
hold hands

121
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:31.330
because all the Irish times he didn't hear that you guys would be going to

122
00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.230
cooperative.
He didn't hear who owns the trailer.

123
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:36.140
He heard Irish times and my child and we got the front page of the Irish Times

124
00:07:36.141 --> 00:07:37.780
the next day with the child.

125
00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.080
It was a classic sharp pinch.
The charge you put the sender's look better

126
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:54.340
from the food's going to do what they want.
The,

127
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.410
they were looking for a bit of publicity to said the school has opened.

128
00:07:57.411 --> 00:07:59.090
It's a new school,
it's in this area.

129
00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.210
I love the ends of the Earth was front page of the Irish Times with the shop and

130
00:08:02.211 --> 00:08:05.960
said this is the new school that opened and it was outside of buildup and so the

131
00:08:05.961 --> 00:08:07.770
chances of actually getting that kind of publicity,

132
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.570
but it was a great photograph.
So you take a great shop,

133
00:08:11.571 --> 00:08:15.610
people will look at it and they remembered example that I used in the book who

134
00:08:15.611 --> 00:08:18.030
was from Butler's pantry.
You're familiar with lockers.

135
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:23.020
Pantry pantry is,
um,
probably the best,

136
00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:24.960
kind of like a gourmet food outlet,

137
00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:28.040
you call it there if you want to buy really good quality,

138
00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.590
fresh homemade food on the way home,
the,

139
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.520
the kind of like marks and Spencer's do those Google ads in other way.

140
00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.250
You put in from change,
he'd eaten an entire meeting and you're stuffed.

141
00:08:37.251 --> 00:08:38.870
I'm thinking I never want to see food again.

142
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:43.940
And a marks and Spencers food that comes on.
You Go Alex Levine
food.

143
00:08:43.941 --> 00:08:45.290
If you're going to promote food,

144
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:50.300
you have to promote food with that yogis and Butler's pantry bring in a

145
00:08:50.301 --> 00:08:52.820
professional photographer each time they take photographs.

146
00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:54.770
But because photography is so,

147
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.880
and it's probably only about half the price that it was five or six years ago,

148
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:03.210
five or six years ago,
you brought him before then the crash,

149
00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.540
if you brought him in photographer to do any photo shoot,
you says the client,

150
00:09:06.541 --> 00:09:10.500
you need 1200 to 1500,
you won't get out.
You don't get changed.

151
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:14.160
And now you're looking at somewhere around three to 600.
So it's a big change.

152
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:15.780
But for a small business,

153
00:09:15.781 --> 00:09:18.780
you're still looking at and bringing in a photographer to take a photograph.

154
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.400
And I don't know if anybody would be used it.

155
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.790
So I have a really good quality photograph,
but will it be used?

156
00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.120
I'm a Butler's pantry doing this.
They trial all the photographs.

157
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:30.240
So what they're doing in you,
I don't know,
Salmon dish,

158
00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:32.730
they story board the entire thing.

159
00:09:32.731 --> 00:09:34.680
So this is how we would like to promote salmon.

160
00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:39.560
This is what we want people to think and feel when we say salmon sound.

161
00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:44.280
That sounded like [inaudible] time,
fresh fish or just sound of knowledge,

162
00:09:44.281 --> 00:09:47.350
whatever it is.
And then we're trying to create the photograph.

163
00:09:47.351 --> 00:09:51.240
So they spent days seeing what works best.
Should I put this here?

164
00:09:51.241 --> 00:09:54.750
Should I put that there?
Um,
how exactly do we make the people,

165
00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:59.230
the groups together and when they think they have an exactly right then began as

166
00:09:59.231 --> 00:09:59.841
a photographer,

167
00:09:59.841 --> 00:10:04.841
it and photographer literally shoots or the photographs that they take have been

168
00:10:05.311 --> 00:10:10.110
used for up to five years,
which is a very long time to get under the photo.

169
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:14.430
But it's good value.
But their attitude is they spend that much money.

170
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.760
They really want to be sure before the photographer comes in the door as giving

171
00:10:17.761 --> 00:10:19.110
the message that they wanted to.

172
00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:22.560
And that's a visual message and that's public relations.
That's a phone call.

173
00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.850
The second area wants to look at a sponsorship because people seem to think that

174
00:10:26.851 --> 00:10:30.090
sponsorship is all about how we to money.

175
00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:34.140
Everybody knows the big sponsorships because during your face then a huge

176
00:10:34.141 --> 00:10:37.580
budgets behind them.
Sponsorship can work really,

177
00:10:37.581 --> 00:10:39.630
really well for small to medium size enterprise,

178
00:10:39.631 --> 00:10:43.070
but it only works really well if like everything else you do,

179
00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.810
like you put time into it and you think it true.

180
00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:48.620
So let me give you two examples of sponsorship.
One Golden,

181
00:10:48.621 --> 00:10:53.621
one bad example I use in the book was company called Action Coach action called

182
00:10:54.241 --> 00:10:56.340
to work with small to medium size enterprises.

183
00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:01.770
And their job is that they basically they go into companies and they teach them

184
00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:02.940
how to be more competitive.

185
00:11:02.941 --> 00:11:07.160
So that may be how to take risks in certain markets.

186
00:11:07.161 --> 00:11:08.690
So they may say to them,
look,

187
00:11:08.691 --> 00:11:11.340
if you're are targeting to target your market as far too broad,

188
00:11:11.341 --> 00:11:12.390
you're never going to reach everybody.

189
00:11:12.391 --> 00:11:15.570
You need to try a little bit tighter or maybe that you just don't know what

190
00:11:15.571 --> 00:11:16.680
you're doing in terms of money.

191
00:11:16.681 --> 00:11:20.220
So we need to actually teach you a little bit more about profit and loss of how

192
00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:23.880
to manage money and how to look after passional and basically they work with

193
00:11:23.881 --> 00:11:26.130
small businesses trying to get them to the next step.

194
00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:30.390
They're based in valley model and they're very passionate about being a valuable

195
00:11:30.391 --> 00:11:34.160
and what can they do for people.
Invaluable.
And there's,
I'm going to be shocked,

196
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:38.830
there's a rugby player,
I hope it's on sports,
who's from Ballymun there.

197
00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:42.870
There'd be no compliment anyway or we could be complex.
Anyway,

198
00:11:42.871 --> 00:11:46.800
this guy is a very good non sport person from value and they met him at the top

199
00:11:46.801 --> 00:11:48.350
on it.
Literally they were just sitting,

200
00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:51.200
listening to him talking and he was talking about the fact that he come from

201
00:11:51.201 --> 00:11:54.280
Valley Mountain.
His family were very poor.
He done very well.

202
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:58.300
He was looking to give something back to the area and it started them thinking

203
00:11:58.301 --> 00:12:03.180
and they developed a board game and the board game teaches you how to do with

204
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:05.220
profit loss.
How do you look after cashflow house,

205
00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:08.430
take risks and to analyze risks.
And they decided to,

206
00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.610
what they would do is they would work with local schools and they would go into

207
00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:15.960
the local schools and create a competition,
but teach children how to,

208
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.180
how to build up the skills.
And the objective was two fold.

209
00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:22.930
One was that they might actually find that they've been interested in commerce

210
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:26.350
or becoming off for nerds are running their own businesses.

211
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:28.720
But the second was that if they never did,

212
00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.840
they have developed skills which are useful for the rest of their lives.

213
00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:34.720
And that's a leaflet example,
a sponsorship.

214
00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:40.060
Another example is are by comparison you're in what we all call Google Lounge

215
00:12:40.061 --> 00:12:42.960
now,
but I used to live around the corner of exact road.
Um,

216
00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:45.330
so I don't know whether you should move out.
Me Mean to go down there.

217
00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.320
I should be thanking you for inviting me back home again.

218
00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.560
But I've lived on rings road that was very involved in the community and

219
00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:54.040
[inaudible] cause I was there,
I lived there all my life.
I got married,

220
00:12:54.041 --> 00:12:54.461
moved away,

221
00:12:54.461 --> 00:12:58.390
came back to live there when I was married and we moved down to about 15 years

222
00:12:58.391 --> 00:12:59.410
ago.
And I just,

223
00:12:59.411 --> 00:13:02.440
I love being involved in community and cause I think it's who we are.

224
00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:06.280
We don't have enough community involvement whether it's community of interest or

225
00:13:06.281 --> 00:13:08.780
physical community in which we did.
We had a guy,

226
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:13.510
Morris County competition by few years ago and the governor's counting

227
00:13:13.511 --> 00:13:16.030
competition was sponsored by the local beauticians,

228
00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:20.020
which I thought was a really nice fixes.
It was clever.
The numbers,

229
00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:23.260
Connie's all came in and they ranged in age at that time.

230
00:13:23.261 --> 00:13:26.740
I'm going back probably 20 years from like 55 to 75 now.

231
00:13:26.741 --> 00:13:30.540
The danger range in age from 35 to 75 but they,

232
00:13:30.541 --> 00:13:34.840
they range in age from about 55 75 so most of the ladies came in and they have

233
00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:38.380
lovely at break off tear that looked like it.
Just taking the car.

234
00:13:38.381 --> 00:13:39.920
There's actually no that you don't have to look at.

235
00:13:39.921 --> 00:13:43.650
The people have and they came up when they sign it.
They talked about like their,

236
00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:46.730
their treat children,
other two grandchildren on how old they were.

237
00:13:46.731 --> 00:13:50.230
A hotter names were very nice,
very pleasant evening.

238
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:51.970
All of the hospitals by the way,

239
00:13:51.971 --> 00:13:54.930
who were alive came in and still only chemists about purpose.

240
00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:57.070
I came in and stood at the end of the hall,

241
00:13:57.250 --> 00:14:01.960
Watch Charlotte that's [inaudible] and it looked safe for the rest of their
life,

242
00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:03.280
but they did their bit.

243
00:14:03.281 --> 00:14:08.281
They did re web and the beauticians was giving a prize for whatever it was,

244
00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:13.530
200 euros worth of goods in the beauticians they sent in a young mother to

245
00:14:13.961 --> 00:14:14.794
present the products.

246
00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:18.040
So you've got a room full of people who are 55 75 years of age,

247
00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:23.160
all famous and they sent in this absolutely drop dead gorgeous girl.

248
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:25.850
She was tall,
she was sticking and set Penn.

249
00:14:25.851 --> 00:14:29.230
She was on this hike where he's teetering on Jimmy Choo's.

250
00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.980
She won't be able to be models do they kind of off like cats on high heels.

251
00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:36.760
She stretched herself all the way up to the stage.
She looked amazing.

252
00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:41.320
She came up or to present to go up the prices and what everybody did in the

253
00:14:41.321 --> 00:14:45.700
audience as you all pass to say,
oh my God,
look at the height of those seeds.

254
00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:48.480
Can you remember everywhere is that high?
Oh,

255
00:14:48.481 --> 00:14:50.810
Yammer was before I had my first child.
Never worn high.

256
00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:55.550
He a high sense of no cash.
Our NICU weights,
she's a sizing.

257
00:14:55.910 --> 00:15:00.680
I'd say she's a size 10 I was never a sized at the smallest idea for us was 12

258
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:05.740
actually what they did was they reminded people of what it was like to be on or

259
00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:07.190
single or before they had children.

260
00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:12.230
They brought them back to their twenties they did not target them as 55 to 75

261
00:15:12.231 --> 00:15:13.064
year olds.

262
00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:16.940
What they should have done was they should have got somebody who was either very

263
00:15:16.941 --> 00:15:19.990
well known in the community who was at that age or the previous winter,

264
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
the last year and brought her in and hopper so that somebody in their sixties or

265
00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.590
seventies presented the prize.
And instead of saying,

266
00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:31.430
look at her waist and do you remember those high years?
You would actually say,

267
00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:34.160
why?
Oh because have a change I've heard or some shit up

268
00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.910
because it's then reminded to keep live,

269
00:15:38.911 --> 00:15:42.710
makes the association with people and not to,
my idea was a good,

270
00:15:42.711 --> 00:15:46.010
a very good sponsorship.
They actually,
they miss fires,
they sponsored it,

271
00:15:46.011 --> 00:15:47.790
they put the money into it.
They sent somebody entered,

272
00:15:47.791 --> 00:15:51.230
cause I had the prizes I death fit anybody even connected the two.

273
00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:52.400
It's not about selling,

274
00:15:52.401 --> 00:15:55.660
but I doubt that anyone who walked past and said that's the beauticians and

275
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:59.000
sponsored because it didn't make that connection.
So sponsorship,

276
00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:01.760
very little money.
And the other thing with sponsorship,

277
00:16:01.761 --> 00:16:04.940
just as I think of when we will package resent,

278
00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:07.580
we moved back after all time.

279
00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:12.440
I grown up and lived there till I was about 18 and I moved back about probably

280
00:16:12.441 --> 00:16:16.400
25 years ago.
I want to move back.
They were still did everything go to the door.

281
00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:20.300
Um,
but I what everybody calls her [inaudible] diary in the morning and our back

282
00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:21.980
late in the evening.
I look for when you're in centers,

283
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:23.930
always have the wrong pronunciation and everything.
Job Dinners,

284
00:16:23.931 --> 00:16:24.950
do it as a general rule.

285
00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.650
So I was done early in the day and literally it does the same story,

286
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:31.130
but outside the door in the morning got off about saying there's no milk or you

287
00:16:31.131 --> 00:16:34.520
can help maybe,
hey,
we'd have milk today.
And it drove me insane.

288
00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:37.370
So at one stage I'm going to one of the neighbors and said from do me a favor,

289
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:41.390
if you see the middle plan,
find out what I own,
pay him off.
Tom,
thanks very much.

290
00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:43.970
Um,
and I just get to know sort of as I needed.

291
00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:49.390
And she said [inaudible] [inaudible] that's the problem with a hooker kid.

292
00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:52.950
There's no problem with them.
It's just that they're so amazing.

293
00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:56.140
It's not there other days and no,
I save as like,
Oh yeah,
yeah,

294
00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:57.650
we're not going to like you.
You know,

295
00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.000
we don't all eat in the middle of the night,

296
00:16:59.001 --> 00:17:00.050
come back from the middle of the night.

297
00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:03.820
That poor man gets off at four o'clock in the morning to deliver the milk.

298
00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:06.460
Nobody should be getting about half three.
It just,

299
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:08.420
I don't get the milk outside the door.
She got up.

300
00:17:08.421 --> 00:17:10.960
I tell you what I do when I'm passing by it.

301
00:17:10.961 --> 00:17:12.590
There's milk outside your door in the morning.

302
00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:15.880
Take and I'll put it into the shop and I think it called for you and it would

303
00:17:15.881 --> 00:17:18.200
collect it from the shop in the evening.
And I said,
just think about this.

304
00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.980
This is not logical.
Each of circumvention these me,
the milk,

305
00:17:21.981 --> 00:17:24.800
you combine all of those committees because I've already integrated out to the

306
00:17:24.801 --> 00:17:29.300
shop.
This is crazy.
Just pay the guy off and tell me how much I old and he said,

307
00:17:29.301 --> 00:17:33.350
she said,
no,
no,
no,
you don't understand.
This man goes out of his way.

308
00:17:33.351 --> 00:17:37.610
He's been producing milk delivery within this area for years and years and he

309
00:17:37.611 --> 00:17:41.450
goes out of his way to sponsor the local soccer club every year.

310
00:17:41.451 --> 00:17:43.580
He buys him a whole set of jerseys.

311
00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:47.030
I thought it was a brilliant example of somebody who like connectors to the

312
00:17:47.031 --> 00:17:48.920
community.
I wasn't connected.

313
00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:52.470
I didn't have kids I didn't respect for this man was doing well.
She did.

314
00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:55.530
I'm an old communities again and that's why we buy our milk from the mine has to

315
00:17:55.531 --> 00:17:56.830
earn a living and he's very good at,

316
00:17:56.831 --> 00:18:01.350
he doesn't have to buy these tee shirts and a really broke homeless sponsorship

317
00:18:01.351 --> 00:18:05.340
and has such a long term impact on people around you.

318
00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:07.980
That mom was getting business because people were brought in.

319
00:18:07.981 --> 00:18:11.400
Parents or people like me who have no kids were totaled.
He's earning his living.

320
00:18:11.401 --> 00:18:14.690
He's contributing to the community.
So good sponsorships,
well,
I don't know,

321
00:18:14.691 --> 00:18:17.970
a lot of constant session jerseys for football team,

322
00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:23.220
but he dumped the return the year on year,
on year on year.
So sponsorship.

323
00:18:23.221 --> 00:18:26.310
The second one,
third one is exhibitions.

324
00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.950
The number of people who don't use exhibitions,

325
00:18:28.951 --> 00:18:31.390
property exhibitions you're going to pay to attend.

326
00:18:31.391 --> 00:18:34.380
It's for you decided as a business that this is where you should be.

327
00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:38.460
But the number of businesses who don't then fold.
True.

328
00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:40.620
If you book an exhibition and you hope it already,

329
00:18:40.621 --> 00:18:44.130
if you know in January they should do an exhibition in September,

330
00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:46.590
what happens is that people send you out all of these,
no,

331
00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:49.200
the exhibition organizers,
central hypnosis and say,

332
00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.330
so when you be doing anything different at the exhibition,

333
00:18:51.331 --> 00:18:54.690
are you launching anything extraordinary?
Do you have any unusual guests?

334
00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:58.040
Is there anything you want to tell us about your time that makes it different?

335
00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:02.120
Um,
small to medium size enterprises because they're busy look at it and go for

336
00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:02.670
about say,

337
00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:06.230
how do I know in January we've got to go to in September so we need it just told

338
00:19:06.231 --> 00:19:09.260
you one side,
say I'll do it later and then come August.

339
00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:13.540
I say that all the information and whoever was organizing has already decided

340
00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:18.210
who gets the publicity because in January or February,
the organizer was saying,

341
00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.310
I need to know where my stories are coming from.

342
00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:24.680
So if you take the trouble to tell me that you're doing something different and

343
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:28.140
promote you,
so it's freaky or that's sitting there waiting for them.

344
00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:31.470
But people don't actually take advantage of because they need to move.

345
00:19:31.471 --> 00:19:33.810
So maturity there and really if they did,

346
00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:38.040
they have a whole team of professional people promoting them.
It's a no brainer.

347
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:42.150
It should make sense.
I was at an exhibition for Tyee students,

348
00:19:42.151 --> 00:19:45.990
students and teachers last year,
just before the book came out.

349
00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:49.650
And it was a company called high rock productions who would take in an

350
00:19:49.651 --> 00:19:52.540
exhibition standard.
And the exhibition is huge,

351
00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:57.560
isn't this massive warehouse in one part of them and it's through our house and

352
00:19:57.661 --> 00:20:00.450
every single stand had something for transition year students.

353
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:04.360
So you had learned your client going to look funny.
Greeks.
Um,

354
00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:09.050
we teach you how to make presentation skills,
come kayaking with else,

355
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:12.570
um,
whole load of who we teach you first aid.

356
00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:17.100
Ho makes up between kind of skills that you would use as an individual and

357
00:20:17.101 --> 00:20:20.880
things did you went out and did as groups and this particular group,

358
00:20:20.881 --> 00:20:21.780
Hi rob productions,

359
00:20:21.781 --> 00:20:25.320
I stopped you because when I came around the corner who was an entire square

360
00:20:25.321 --> 00:20:29.550
closed off that what they actually do is they go into schools and they help

361
00:20:29.551 --> 00:20:33.630
children's speak Irish.
So they prepped them for the oral Irish six hours,

362
00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:36.960
but they do it by creating this plane.
So it's very creative.

363
00:20:36.961 --> 00:20:37.980
They work with the children,

364
00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.040
they create this play and when they've made this play to help them put it all,

365
00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:44.460
it's all through ours.
So they become more confident about speaking divers.

366
00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:47.030
Very hard thing to promote to.

367
00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:49.840
Most of them probably have an interest in like or liars,

368
00:20:49.841 --> 00:20:52.140
that's exams and they're looking at Tyee,

369
00:20:52.141 --> 00:20:54.920
which just a year in between their exams.
So they're not focusing on,

370
00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:57.780
I'm like this group had done was they had taken a square,

371
00:20:57.810 --> 00:21:00.560
they had about three times the amount of space that they should have had it.

372
00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.570
So the taking a square in front of the style,

373
00:21:02.571 --> 00:21:05.020
but they closed it off and they were playing virtual tellers.

374
00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:09.400
It was absolutely brilliant because one of the guys were there and you're
saying,

375
00:21:09.401 --> 00:21:13.450
okay,
are you ready to serve you?
Step off the court please.
Your honor.
The court,

376
00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:17.770
you don't have to go.
And as people walk past great here.
Oh sorry.
Sorry.
Am I,

377
00:21:17.771 --> 00:21:21.100
am I okay?
And everybody thought there was nothing.

378
00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:24.520
There was absolutely nothing,
but everybody got,
can we still back?

379
00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.700
I went the ball where there's a play.
There was a,
sorry,

380
00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:30.460
can I have the ball there?
Yeah.
Nope,
nope.
At your other phones there.
Yeah.

381
00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:34.240
Can you show it?
Yeah.
Oh,
and everybody stopped to watch.

382
00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:39.070
It was brilliant in took a huge imagine attention to their son and they gave

383
00:21:39.071 --> 00:21:40.720
everybody leaflets.
It's about what they did.

384
00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:45.940
I thought it was [inaudible] reach out when I interviewed them afterwards.

385
00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.820
I said to him,
by the way,
brilliant idea you took over.

386
00:21:48.821 --> 00:21:51.700
So spaceless five and this year,

387
00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:55.700
but I'm not sure if it was a smart as it could have been because a targeted all

388
00:21:55.701 --> 00:22:00.701
of the children and their query was the exhibition was targeted to both children

389
00:22:00.821 --> 00:22:04.720
and teachers and with hindsight they weren't sure if you could target boats in

390
00:22:04.721 --> 00:22:08.800
one exhibition and what they had done was they had successfully got all of the

391
00:22:08.801 --> 00:22:11.890
children with children in the side of it.

392
00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:16.330
We'll and t y years teachers did,
so they'd actually think vagueness card.

393
00:22:16.331 --> 00:22:18.950
They got loads of attention.
They've loads of kids talking about it,

394
00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:23.230
but they didn't have the teachers saying what a good idea and people didn't

395
00:22:23.231 --> 00:22:26.730
connect virtual tennis with what they were actually doing.

396
00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.490
It was interesting because to my eyes coming in as an outsider,

397
00:22:30.491 --> 00:22:34.000
I talk to very smart like you've,
you've captured the whole room.

398
00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:38.410
When they analyze it afterwards they thought good but not as brilliant as it

399
00:22:38.411 --> 00:22:42.490
could have been.
I suppose one of the things that I'm really conscious of,

400
00:22:42.491 --> 00:22:45.460
the key ares that it's not,
it's not rocket science.

401
00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:49.750
It does take a lot of time,
but most of the scales can be easily learned,

402
00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:54.040
but it's about not doing things on the flight and cause we artists respond.

403
00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.800
Whereas things that are done on the fly,
you end up saying,
why didn't that work?

404
00:22:57.130 --> 00:22:58.780
I put loads of time into a chart.

405
00:22:58.781 --> 00:23:01.660
Notice it works really well if you sit down area and saying,

406
00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:05.010
low my trying to reach am my trying to achieve and why get them,

407
00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:09.040
what are they interested?
One of the very clever things,

408
00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:13.120
Carol companies that I profiled in the book was new rich server and you've

409
00:23:13.121 --> 00:23:16.000
reached silver.
I'm a great believer in third party endorsement.

410
00:23:16.001 --> 00:23:17.010
If you stand up and say,
no,

411
00:23:17.011 --> 00:23:19.570
I run a wonderful business that's involved with business.

412
00:23:19.571 --> 00:23:21.430
Everybody in his loves what they do.

413
00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:24.010
We provide great quality product or whatever.

414
00:23:24.011 --> 00:23:26.950
Everybody would say where you would say that wouldn't get,

415
00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.330
which is fair enough because you're not going to say are going a rubbish

416
00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:32.560
business.
[inaudible] was the guy who did that is jewelry businessman post.

417
00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:35.520
There wasn't,
one of them famously said he just produced a joke,

418
00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:37.780
jewelry and people buy it and the entire business,

419
00:23:37.781 --> 00:23:40.940
what goes very shortly afterwards because everybody said,
well I,

420
00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:44.740
I buy that truck jewelry and he thinks that junk.
Why do I waste my time binder?

421
00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:46.400
As a general rule,

422
00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:50.480
you're looking at third party adults from just where somebody says have you it's

423
00:23:50.481 --> 00:23:55.010
good.
Or were you creating association and you put your very clever creates the

424
00:23:55.011 --> 00:23:58.190
association.
They came up with this idea of style ambassadors.

425
00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:00.170
So instead of just being June,

426
00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:06.320
they start to using people like any Google and Naomi Campbell,

427
00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:10.130
um,
Ronan O'gara and say,
okay,
these are people who,

428
00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:13.460
who you can associated with our jewelry.
Interestingly enough,

429
00:24:13.461 --> 00:24:17.990
they use linter grade.
You're the lady from Dallas.
That's interesting.

430
00:24:17.991 --> 00:24:22.550
How many people actually know Linda Gray from Dallas?
Very few.
Excellent.

431
00:24:22.551 --> 00:24:24.740
Did I do,
it makes my point because she was wearing,

432
00:24:24.741 --> 00:24:28.040
she was history in the late eight years ago when they started using her as she

433
00:24:28.041 --> 00:24:30.600
was wearing big chunky.
You read shooting.

434
00:24:30.601 --> 00:24:33.500
Now she's a fabulous in her seventies at the time,

435
00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:35.780
you would've given her like 52 at the most,

436
00:24:35.781 --> 00:24:39.580
should have amazing and she's wearing this chunky jewelry and you look to talk.

437
00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:43.010
She,
she actually isn't the type of person who wears chunky jewelry.

438
00:24:43.011 --> 00:24:47.510
If she had been doing newbridge country dining at home,
here's,

439
00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:51.770
here's how the posh Stein,
it probably would have sacked much more easily,

440
00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:54.110
but doing chunky jewelry at her age,

441
00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:55.910
even though she found this didn't seem to work,

442
00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:58.810
but it did work very well with the likes of baby Hoover room.

443
00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:03.410
And they only can go and what they do is they associate the people with the

444
00:25:03.411 --> 00:25:06.620
product.
So if they're stylish and there they wear our product,

445
00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:09.040
you should do the same.
Very interesting.

446
00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:12.170
When I spoke to the lady who coordinates the brand ambassadors,

447
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:16.880
I said to that must be very difficult because I innocently assumed that if you

448
00:25:16.881 --> 00:25:21.740
were an Uber and you were wearing,
you bridge that as new ritual and say,

449
00:25:21.741 --> 00:25:22.161
and by the way,

450
00:25:22.161 --> 00:25:25.970
sweepy either not once you were in anybody else's jury because we're paying you

451
00:25:25.971 --> 00:25:29.180
shed loads of money.
So I expect to see you in you were jokingly and she said,

452
00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:33.950
Oh God no.
And because nobody who follows Amy Uber will believe that.

453
00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:37.250
They would know that of course you where she has her own side,

454
00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:39.080
she whereas any one of a number of different things.

455
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:42.590
So when she chooses to wear newbridge we're happy that she does.

456
00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:45.740
But when she chooses to wear somebody else,
we're equally happy.

457
00:25:45.741 --> 00:25:49.850
And as I was very clever because it then doesn't look like we pay you to wear

458
00:25:49.851 --> 00:25:50.900
this jewelry all the time.

459
00:25:50.901 --> 00:25:53.570
It looks like yes you are around the ambassador when you feel like wearing it.

460
00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:58.010
And she actually wore a long chain and when she announced that she was expecting

461
00:25:58.011 --> 00:25:58.830
her second charge,

462
00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:03.830
more love newbridge change had a match feature and she tweeted something about

463
00:26:04.611 --> 00:26:05.001
the coach,

464
00:26:05.001 --> 00:26:10.001
I can't remember both by guard chained by newbridge and we saw that they had no

465
00:26:10.551 --> 00:26:13.610
idea she was going to do it.
They knew what she was doing,
the focus.

466
00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:14.900
She was cranky that she was pregnant,

467
00:26:14.901 --> 00:26:18.390
but she didn't want to say if few regiments eventually tweeted,
it was just like,

468
00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:21.800
oh,
it's her.
Right.
So she tweeted that they weren't expecting it.

469
00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:23.390
They sold off the chain,

470
00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:26.870
they went to a second production and so on the second production as well,

471
00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:30.200
the number of people who just wanted to buy that chain.

472
00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:33.080
So the association from their point you work really well.

473
00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:36.440
They associate with people that people want to look like or people want to

474
00:26:36.441 --> 00:26:40.280
emulate.
And they follow that through with New Zealand style icons.

475
00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:44.880
So they actually have all of these calls which are actually exempt down to Saint

476
00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:48.510
Joe's or Mafi from that.
It's incredible.
And how old's the tones are,

477
00:26:48.511 --> 00:26:51.490
but they were Audrey Hepburn's or they were,
um,

478
00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:55.560
who is an AP went up as Princess Grace of Monaco and Grace Kelly.

479
00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:58.020
So you ended up looking at these clothes thinking wow,

480
00:26:58.110 --> 00:26:59.380
that's when people actually more today,

481
00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:02.190
anybody go down for the Michael Jackson exhibition by the way.

482
00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:07.420
And Michael Jackson's that close.
I mean,
you know,
the famous girls are there.

483
00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:09.570
I just decided I have to go down in there.

484
00:27:09.571 --> 00:27:12.780
So I have my friends cause I actually sent somebody and they'd be transfer.

485
00:27:12.781 --> 00:27:17.730
But this one tiny like size age would have the giant,

486
00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:21.130
he was absolutely tiny and but they,

487
00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.670
they actually make that association and it's clever.

488
00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:26.550
It's an association that started with,
or you call it,

489
00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:30.050
you buy some of the product,
you've made the link.
Very,
very smart.

490
00:27:30.051 --> 00:27:34.890
And they also work with Audrey Hepburn's and Grace Kelly's foundation so that

491
00:27:34.891 --> 00:27:37.600
they improve whatever it is they design that they use.

492
00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:40.350
This would have been the kind of thing that Grace Kelly would have used.

493
00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:43.410
And so it carries her name with very,
very smart,

494
00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:47.730
much simper tarred party endorsement if you like.

495
00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:52.980
When I was talking about the book too,
Bobby Care on Newstalk,
uh,

496
00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:54.390
he had said to me,
okay,
why don't I do,

497
00:27:54.391 --> 00:27:56.910
is I choose the examples that we lose my sister,

498
00:27:56.911 --> 00:27:59.520
I don't mind after you've had this in the book,
I'm happy to talk about,

499
00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:03.110
so we actually talked about Jackie March and many talked about Jack Morris

500
00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:06.930
Company and we actually,
I mean it's a 10 or 12 minutes interview.

501
00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:10.110
So we went through the interview and we chat with myself.
This kind is crazy.

502
00:28:10.111 --> 00:28:11.490
And then he'd go into his office.

503
00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:15.960
The walls are paper with paper and every piece of paper has this tweet.

504
00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:19.290
How many retreats?
What was the reach isn't worth doing?
Did it work?

505
00:28:19.291 --> 00:28:20.190
Should we do it again?

506
00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:24.030
He dates a month within an inch of his life and it just seems so strange that

507
00:28:24.031 --> 00:28:25.320
it's all on paper,
right?
The walls,

508
00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:27.510
but I presume it's because it's around a little bit.

509
00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:29.580
Reminds them this is what we are,
this is what we do.

510
00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.090
Did the interview [inaudible] promotion for the book?

511
00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:36.900
My job was still as I was,
that was on a Saturday,

512
00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:39.090
on Sunday as I was driving somewhere,

513
00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:43.110
I got a text from Jack to say thanks very much for the kind words that I put my

514
00:28:43.111 --> 00:28:45.990
business yesterday.
I knew whose father was in and he said,

515
00:28:45.991 --> 00:28:49.920
unfortunately my father just died and somebody heard the interview on the way to

516
00:28:49.921 --> 00:28:54.300
the funeral and very kind of you say such nice things.
My thought,
great.

517
00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:59.040
This didn't actually text and said sorry to [inaudible] and thanks for the

518
00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:01.590
comments and then I'm following Friday.

519
00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:05.610
I came into the office and there's this huge box of cupcakes.
So I said,
well,

520
00:29:05.611 --> 00:29:10.090
we'll ask who's sending the scope cases it us,
us,
it specifically says Ellen.

521
00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:15.100
Ghanaians who sending me cupcakes and inside was enough who's a dozen cupcakes

522
00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:18.330
and to Saint Jacques saying,

523
00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:22.950
thank you very much for all of the comments on news talk you wouldn't believe.

524
00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:26.070
How much business do you got on the back of the best regards?
Jack,

525
00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:30.150
I wasn't promoting his business,
I wasn't flooding with business,

526
00:29:30.151 --> 00:29:33.600
I wasn't advertising.
I would just say he's really good at what he does.

527
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:35.520
And that's a third party endorsement.

528
00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:39.960
That's somebody else saying it with no ax to grind.
And that is very,

529
00:29:39.961 --> 00:29:44.410
very powerful and that's something actually that you would Google to do very

530
00:29:44.411 --> 00:29:48.880
easy.
You work with SMEs,
you've already gone through who they are,

531
00:29:48.881 --> 00:29:52.480
you cross checked and you think they have something of value that you could

532
00:29:52.481 --> 00:29:55.820
invest your time or your money or your energy it.
Um,

533
00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:59.680
is there a way that you can actually say to people,
do you know what?

534
00:29:59.681 --> 00:30:01.030
There is a way that you can brand,

535
00:30:01.031 --> 00:30:05.620
you can say brand Google works with you so that they can take that to other

536
00:30:05.621 --> 00:30:08.950
people and say,
it's not just me saying I know I'm a Google believes.

537
00:30:08.951 --> 00:30:12.200
I don't want them just to leave you with that part.

538
00:30:12.201 --> 00:30:14.980
There are six other hot tips in the book.

539
00:30:14.981 --> 00:30:16.870
I'm happy to go through all of them if you wish,

540
00:30:16.871 --> 00:30:18.640
but I might actually give you a chance to,
cause you're,

541
00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:22.140
you're sitting quiet came and I'm much more comfortable where people are in and

542
00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:25.510
the elderly.
So might let you ask a few questions and see what happens.

543
00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:28.800
<v 2>Thanks.
Great.
Thanks Alan.
That was</v>

544
00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:34.380
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

545
00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:41.070
<v 2>well we jump straight into that on how
they'd like to ask.</v>

546
00:30:41.071 --> 00:30:44.620
We've got two microphones to pass around or any questions.
Are we good?

547
00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:51.450
You're building up some last and confidence.
Trying to think about it.
Um,

548
00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:56.670
I'd like to,
to know,
and um,
he touched on very,
very briefly,

549
00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:57.570
they age,

550
00:30:57.570 --> 00:31:02.160
knowing your audience and considering who exactly am I trying to reach the other

551
00:31:02.161 --> 00:31:05.940
than maybe just asking yourself those really specific questions.

552
00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:07.590
Is there anything else?
What,

553
00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:11.520
what else should we be asking yourselves or how else can we really answer that

554
00:31:11.521 --> 00:31:12.354
question?

555
00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:15.370
<v 0>I taped the trap that most people fall into.
Um,</v>

556
00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:19.370
we all look to each people that use the same methods that we used.

557
00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:20.760
So if I read the Irish times,

558
00:31:20.761 --> 00:31:22.860
I assume that everybody I want to reach for the Irish Times.

559
00:31:22.861 --> 00:31:25.980
If I live on social media,
I assume it'll live on social media.

560
00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:28.830
And what happens is we forget to look at the other side and say,

561
00:31:28.831 --> 00:31:31.020
actually where did they,
I call it where people feed.

562
00:31:31.021 --> 00:31:36.021
I attended a conference a few years back and the guy talked about chasing pages.

563
00:31:36.271 --> 00:31:38.370
I don't know if you've heard this story before.
I call.
It was brilliant.

564
00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:40.350
And he talked about if you chase the agents,

565
00:31:40.351 --> 00:31:44.160
if you try to feed pigeons and you chased them in a park,
pigeons fly away.

566
00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:45.660
Like go and stop chasing your brother.

567
00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:49.530
Watch the old man who sits down at the park seat and he just keeps dropping

568
00:31:49.531 --> 00:31:54.270
cones and the come to him and it's about knowing what I believe is looking for a

569
00:31:54.271 --> 00:31:55.540
bread.
And I was never hassled.

570
00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:57.480
They'll come to you and more often they come to you.

571
00:31:57.481 --> 00:32:02.430
The more they trust you and the more that you build up their confidence with any

572
00:32:02.431 --> 00:32:03.330
kind of an audience.

573
00:32:03.331 --> 00:32:06.140
If your problem is that you look at them from the inside out,

574
00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:09.750
you should look from the outside in.
The chances are with any business,

575
00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:11.180
you actually need to use it.

576
00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:15.870
They said originally when when radio was overtaking my television or television

577
00:32:15.871 --> 00:32:19.500
was abandoned,
it says the death of radio.
When newspapers came in,

578
00:32:19.501 --> 00:32:21.730
they said it was the debt to something else.
When social media can,

579
00:32:21.731 --> 00:32:23.940
they just said,
oh,
that's it.
People will over your social media.

580
00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:28.410
It's actually not true.
We did.
We did an interview at the weekend rotation,

581
00:32:28.411 --> 00:32:29.640
a TV presenters course,

582
00:32:30.570 --> 00:32:33.090
and we were doing mock interviews and it bounces over your thing for the

583
00:32:33.091 --> 00:32:37.860
shoulders and one of the ladies that the students were just interviewing each

584
00:32:37.861 --> 00:32:39.150
other withdrawals,

585
00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:43.220
all of our 20 [inaudible] and the [inaudible] who was eating essentially one of

586
00:32:43.221 --> 00:32:46.870
your eyes,
why are you interested in?
And she says active is,
that's the other guy,

587
00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:50.930
Brandon.
So ask her about us.
Married this scream speech.
Donald Trump tweeting,

588
00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:55.260
it's called loans,
all that kind of stuff.
It was,
if it was fascinating,

589
00:32:55.261 --> 00:32:57.470
which one she,
since we saw Meryl Streep's speech,

590
00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:01.360
you are all familiar that Meryl Streep made a speech.
Okay,
just check.
Uh,

591
00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:04.470
Marilyn speeds.
Meryl Streep's speech at the Golden Globes.
Hush.

592
00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:05.990
You think we should?
I don't know.

593
00:33:05.991 --> 00:33:09.870
I didn't hear what was it and she said okay.

594
00:33:09.871 --> 00:33:14.080
And she gave a very quick explanation and she says,
I'm Donald Trump tweeted,

595
00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:18.110
you know,
the most no brace back cause in America,
whatever.
Yeah,
I can see that.

596
00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:19.851
She's okay.

597
00:33:19.851 --> 00:33:24.590
Well what do you think about the fact that the president elect is tweeting about

598
00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:28.520
an actress and she said,
I don't know.
I haven't seen any of,
I have no idea.

599
00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:31.970
I catch up on all my social media on Sunday mornings

600
00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:37.280
and it was eye opening.
It was like everybody in the room was too.

601
00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:40.460
Everybody had heard Meryl Streep Computer.
How could you miss it?

602
00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:44.810
Because it's on a Taco from so many different angles and then her work Sunday

603
00:33:44.811 --> 00:33:46.750
morning going when she caught him up and everything.

604
00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:49.940
So it's looking at your audience from that point of view and saying,

605
00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:52.130
if they made,
if there are so many newspaper readers,

606
00:33:52.131 --> 00:33:53.240
then that's where you need to get them.

607
00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:56.570
It doesn't matter that you could be all over social media.
They will find kid.

608
00:33:56.810 --> 00:34:00.580
If they're social media people then were what bloggers do they actually read and

609
00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:03.590
who influences them,
who they think is rubbish because they think it's brilliant.

610
00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:06.860
If it's radio,
which radio stations do they listen to us?

611
00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:08.930
So anything you talk to just her sorority,

612
00:34:08.970 --> 00:34:13.730
you want us to different [inaudible] you choose with the Diet that you stay more

613
00:34:13.731 --> 00:34:15.650
or less on the Diet that you're on a certain date.

614
00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:17.710
And then if you're over a certain age group,

615
00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:19.940
where do you actually go hunting for information?

616
00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:22.940
Or does it come into you by email?
So it's really,

617
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:25.010
it's breaking down your audience.

618
00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:28.940
I'm probably choosing a different tool for each subsection.
That's a very long,

619
00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:32.540
that sounds great.
Thank you very much.
We've got a question here.

620
00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:39.970
I was thinking,
uh,
first of all this we'll talk,
um,

621
00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:45.300
I was thinking some sponsorships.
Um,
so I think most of us who are in an ex pat,

622
00:34:45.301 --> 00:34:49.330
so not sort of Ireland.
And so when I've dug deep into the community,

623
00:34:49.390 --> 00:34:51.210
as you kind of mentioned some of the examples that you had,

624
00:34:51.610 --> 00:34:53.960
what would be some of the easier ways to get into a,

625
00:34:53.961 --> 00:34:56.920
you're giving up a sponsorship or get in touch with people.

626
00:34:56.921 --> 00:35:01.920
What would be some of the first couple of steps to getting as sponsorships to

627
00:35:01.921 --> 00:35:05.320
actually find something that's functioning?
I would go the other way around them.

628
00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:08.670
If you're not from Ireland,
I achieved something that was unique to you.

629
00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:12.810
So it might be presented in movies or something and you think,
okay,

630
00:35:12.811 --> 00:35:16.220
how have a look at the community and see where is there a community week and it

631
00:35:16.221 --> 00:35:17.190
is a community week.

632
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:21.210
Is there a role in there somewhere for movies and as parks and movies we can

633
00:35:21.211 --> 00:35:22.000
show Brazilian boom,

634
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.590
you think depends on what the connection is that you're trying to make and it

635
00:35:25.591 --> 00:35:28.130
also sets you up.
You are the logical connections.

636
00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:30.160
You can actually introduce yourself and say,
I'm presented.

637
00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:31.610
That's why I'm passionate about presenting movies.

638
00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:34.290
He never would have guessed and people would ask you all happening because

639
00:35:34.291 --> 00:35:37.050
people actually got make the connection.
Unless you tell him a seat at the table,

640
00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:39.810
they would say you an ex patch or whatever.
You're not various,

641
00:35:39.811 --> 00:35:40.830
but the moment where you're from.

642
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:44.550
And so I would look for something that is close to your heart that you're an

643
00:35:44.551 --> 00:35:47.790
expert in,
that you can offer just sponsor,
but it's more work.

644
00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:52.050
It means that you need to set it up creative enrollment.
But if you do,

645
00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:56.340
people will come.
When I did the first active age week,

646
00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.290
everybody told me that I was wasting my time.

647
00:35:58.291 --> 00:36:00.690
If I was looking at creating things for senior citizens,

648
00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:04.440
but they were interested in was Bingo.
So like if people to gossip,

649
00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:07.030
I did Bingo seven nights a week,
then you happy I've,

650
00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:11.190
and I said bill to his face to systems I can face that ever played thing go or

651
00:36:11.191 --> 00:36:15.130
has any desire to create big no,
no.
It's not happening.
Well,

652
00:36:15.131 --> 00:36:17.010
what I want to do is I'll do one night or finger,

653
00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:20.370
but I would do everything else around it.
And if nobody comes to anything,

654
00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:23.370
there's my boss.
You can kick in and say,
I told you you're picking up an agent.

655
00:36:23.371 --> 00:36:26.790
You were wrong.
And we did historical nights,
we did both trips.

656
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000
We did mystery trip sessions to complete.

657
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:33.000
We did afternoons where people just came in and somebody who played piano and

658
00:36:33.001 --> 00:36:33.834
they all signed.

659
00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:38.960
We were blocked at every single standing room only at every single function and

660
00:36:39.031 --> 00:36:40.170
the alternative legal as well.

661
00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:44.010
But nobody said at the end of the week called a pity of Austin called Bingo.

662
00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:45.480
So I think if you actually,

663
00:36:45.481 --> 00:36:49.200
if you find something that you're passionate about that you can create,

664
00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:51.690
even will come and it will make a association.

665
00:36:51.691 --> 00:36:53.490
It also gives you a niche that nobody else has.

666
00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:57.540
The other thing with sponsorship is if you come in to sponsor after somebody has

667
00:36:57.541 --> 00:37:01.170
been there,
it takes a long time to lose the last sponsor's name.

668
00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:04.020
So the general rule is that you should sponsor,

669
00:37:04.021 --> 00:37:08.010
if you're doing a sponsorship data should be for three years and you should add

670
00:37:08.011 --> 00:37:11.280
an extra two so you have a facility that nobody else can step in for the next

671
00:37:11.281 --> 00:37:12.590
two you get first dibs up,

672
00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:17.100
but after five you should move on back to your audience again cause after five

673
00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:22.400
if you're targeting 17 year olds and 17 year old and I ate in a French 102 there

674
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:25.380
are no longer interested in the same things.
They moved on to something else.

675
00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:30.360
But after five years your name stays for at least two so the next sponsor coming

676
00:37:30.361 --> 00:37:34.290
in has an awful job branding their name onto whatever it is they're doing.

677
00:37:34.291 --> 00:37:38.030
So I go the other words and creative with your name monitors and let them follow

678
00:37:38.031 --> 00:37:38.864
you.

679
00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:43.620
<v 2>Hi,
my name's [inaudible],
I'm parking in sensing thing.</v>

680
00:37:43.621 --> 00:37:47.760
Google marketing solutions team.
In fact,
mine is not a question,

681
00:37:47.761 --> 00:37:52.420
it's just an inspiration for you.
It was very,
very high hump them at Google's.

682
00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:53.420
We tried it yet.

683
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:58.290
That's Google sales team are trying to increase our share folders from our class

684
00:37:58.380 --> 00:37:59.640
media business.

685
00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:04.740
But today you gave me another amazing idea why they are want to change to

686
00:38:04.741 --> 00:38:08.250
increase our budget or team our clients made in Westmont.

687
00:38:08.251 --> 00:38:13.251
Also we can have pay your share from our client's PR budget as well if he can

688
00:38:13.381 --> 00:38:17.880
positions Google products as a PR scholarships.
It was very,

689
00:38:17.881 --> 00:38:21.600
very eye opening and it was a Hutu beverage for my business.

690
00:38:21.601 --> 00:38:23.010
When I turn back to my desk,

691
00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:28.140
hundred percent viability tribal to meet six I will organize meetings with my

692
00:38:28.981 --> 00:38:30.150
clients,
PR managers.

693
00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:33.450
I'm talking about people too that they can use for their parents.

694
00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:36.130
I just want you to half a percent of that business stuff.
That's all

695
00:38:38.490 --> 00:38:43.140
<v 0>you're right because advertising very often is part of a promotional plan so you</v>

696
00:38:43.141 --> 00:38:46.020
can do a huge amount of PR that actually gets you out there and gets your

697
00:38:46.021 --> 00:38:48.930
product and your brown no,
but it gets to the stage where you say,
no,

698
00:38:48.931 --> 00:38:52.440
I need to sell it,
but you will still use PR two and a half.

699
00:38:52.441 --> 00:38:55.320
Part of it is the straight selling and the other is you still keep turning up

700
00:38:55.321 --> 00:38:59.140
and people say,
oh,
I saw an ad for that somewhere.
So brilliant.
I mean,
I know

701
00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:01.980
<v 3>I brag about we can have a picture</v>

702
00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:09.800
or a story that was very inspiring.
Like,
um,

703
00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:14.230
my father was probably the Milkman didn't realize the effects that the

704
00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:16.970
sponsorship has.
So my question is,

705
00:39:16.971 --> 00:39:21.290
if the SME is decides to do a PR investments,

706
00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:26.060
what kind of advice can you give?
Defining what success is,

707
00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:29.460
<v 0>it depends on what you're actually trying to achieve.
Um,</v>

708
00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:33.150
so what's about to shoot is best at is creating name awareness.

709
00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:37.170
If you look at any of the great sponsorships they started because people were

710
00:39:37.171 --> 00:39:39.630
moving into new markets or they had changed their name.

711
00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:43.260
So the company was no longer and was one thing,
it was no longer something else.

712
00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:44.010
Um,

713
00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:49.010
when who sponsored the first cycle race around artists wants a Toyota and they

714
00:39:50.401 --> 00:39:52.140
sponsored it because it's a car company,

715
00:39:52.141 --> 00:39:54.230
it doesn't make sense in the car company responds to recycling.

716
00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:57.780
Raisa was at the time when I'm Steven Roach and all of those guys were winning

717
00:39:57.781 --> 00:39:58.470
medals.

718
00:39:58.470 --> 00:40:01.500
But it was because the toilet we're used to be called was the term used to be

719
00:40:01.501 --> 00:40:04.560
called data and people didn't know the brand.

720
00:40:04.561 --> 00:40:07.710
So the whole idea was if you create an awareness of the brand,
people say,

721
00:40:07.711 --> 00:40:11.460
I've heard it here at what's the story?
It opens the door a bit.

722
00:40:11.461 --> 00:40:14.040
Or what sponsorship is best at is creating brand awareness.

723
00:40:14.310 --> 00:40:18.060
So if you are an SME and you're trying to make people conscious of the fact that

724
00:40:18.061 --> 00:40:19.980
you are around,
sponsorship is very good at it.

725
00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:23.520
But you need to do your before and after.
Most people would tell you,

726
00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:26.890
if you ask people in Google,
how many people have heard of Google,

727
00:40:26.890 --> 00:40:29.990
Google is probably a bad example.
They go,
well,
you know,

728
00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:32.760
is there anybody less than the world's?
A couple of people who are as I believe,

729
00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:36.020
I haven't heard this yet,
but you know everybody,
every SME,

730
00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:37.280
just the same thing they say we,

731
00:40:37.281 --> 00:40:40.410
they were very well known and it is true within your own circle.

732
00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:44.760
So if it's within a public relations circle but then it circle it probably are

733
00:40:44.761 --> 00:40:47.970
very well know,
but they're not very well known to a wider world.

734
00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:50.340
So if you're sponsoring within the community,

735
00:40:50.341 --> 00:40:53.880
because you just want the community to know who you are,
what you do,

736
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:57.360
you're on their doorstep and they should really be thinking of you in terms of

737
00:40:57.570 --> 00:41:00.450
maybe few through employment the door and just saying to people,

738
00:41:00.451 --> 00:41:03.150
they're good guys and they're up there and they're doing great work.

739
00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:05.670
Then it will work very well for that project.
Evil,

740
00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:07.710
you need research in advance and research afterwards.

741
00:41:07.711 --> 00:41:10.290
It doesn't have to be hugely scientific.
You can,

742
00:41:10.291 --> 00:41:11.580
so long as you structure the questions,

743
00:41:11.581 --> 00:41:13.890
you probably know this but so long as you structure the questions so that

744
00:41:13.891 --> 00:41:17.370
they're open enough and people don't know what the answer is because if you ask

745
00:41:17.371 --> 00:41:19.260
people,
do you think Google is wonderful?
They'd say,
yes,
I do.

746
00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:23.790
They think of as awful.
That's a problem.
If you say,
what do you think of Google?

747
00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:27.060
You get an understand sir,
because you haven't told them what it is you expect.

748
00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:29.490
You can do it by,
if it's a community thing,

749
00:41:29.491 --> 00:41:31.320
you can send people out into the community saying,

750
00:41:31.321 --> 00:41:34.040
have you ever heard of this organization idea of what they do?

751
00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:38.390
Who's in the building of the car there and you you find out a loan for what you

752
00:41:38.391 --> 00:41:40.610
do is you go back and you do the same research afterwards.

753
00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:44.240
So I don't expect that everybody will suddenly say,
oh my God more herbage.

754
00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:47.930
But if you get like a 5% increase,
that's cool.

755
00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:49.970
You're moving in the right direction.
And again,

756
00:41:49.971 --> 00:41:53.240
it's targeted to your audience or the people who stopped to ask questions of,

757
00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:56.210
we sent a group of,
I'm sorry,
it's very long winded answer.
Well we sent a group,

758
00:41:56.211 --> 00:41:59.960
I was with one stage and we were training journalists and I sent them out to do

759
00:41:59.961 --> 00:42:03.020
interviews with people and I said,
now be sure you don't get all the same people.

760
00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:06.810
So don't ask some people who look like you.
Stop.
Even across a mix of age groups,

761
00:42:06.811 --> 00:42:10.460
stock men and women do everything from like 17 to 77 or something.

762
00:42:11.090 --> 00:42:15.170
And I'm trying to make something,
make some kind of note about middle aged,

763
00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:20.210
senior person,
younger person.
So when you come back,
you can say,
I interviewed,

764
00:42:20.211 --> 00:42:23.150
cause it was for radio,
so I interviewed 10 people.

765
00:42:23.151 --> 00:42:27.290
Four of them would have been under 25 meals were over 55 and the guys actually

766
00:42:27.291 --> 00:42:29.240
went to,
and there were Italian and Italians in the room.

767
00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:32.960
They have a whole other way of doing things so that he wouldn't have,
he said,

768
00:42:32.961 --> 00:42:37.150
hello,
I'm John Uncle.
So ks you're telling me how old are you?
And they said,

769
00:42:37.151 --> 00:42:39.510
I parked six to half.
I'm followed you.
Chuck couldn't believe it.

770
00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:43.300
If an Irish person did it,
then I picked you up off the ground.
But it's,

771
00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:46.770
it's the audience you're trying to reach.
So if you target the age group as well,

772
00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:47.653
carefully,

773
00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:51.190
but that also means watching who you send them to send out a young person,

774
00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:53.030
target older people that will do it as well.

775
00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:55.880
Send up an older person is at the same age group stopping in.

776
00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:59.720
You'd get more honest answers.
I'm just wondering,
the four year old,

777
00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:05.350
did you know what audience you're targeting or did that come along when you are

778
00:43:05.570 --> 00:43:09.430
writing?
How did you decide your audience that you're targeting?

779
00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:12.160
What happened was,
this is my second book,
my book,

780
00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:15.830
the first book that I would have felt loving relationship with practical

781
00:43:15.831 --> 00:43:19.550
approach.
Everybody in our interest studies to be off,

782
00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:21.300
so we're effective oncologist.

783
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:25.550
It's an academic text it eight gigs and it's a doorstop but 600 pages or

784
00:43:25.551 --> 00:43:26.384
something.

785
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:29.960
I actually thought that I would be revising that we're not doing anything else

786
00:43:29.961 --> 00:43:34.550
with PR and I had met with Mercier press who published the book and I actually

787
00:43:34.551 --> 00:43:39.551
met with the advise clients and they said I had sent them the pitch and they

788
00:43:39.591 --> 00:43:41.630
came back and said,
actually we would be interested,
you know,

789
00:43:41.631 --> 00:43:45.300
we meet you and we will be interested in publishing to go for the client.

790
00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:47.590
And I said,
that's fine.
I really appreciate you having it off.

791
00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:50.180
Whereas should we go with the group?
Who else should publish it?

792
00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:52.130
At the end of the conversation she said,

793
00:43:52.131 --> 00:43:54.020
you never thought to write another book on public relations.

794
00:43:54.021 --> 00:43:57.110
You're settled this year unless you both,
to answer your question,

795
00:43:57.111 --> 00:44:01.000
I know cause I've kind of covered everybody who studies the subject and she said

796
00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:04.970
that I said,
Oh yeah,
I looked at,
I have no sense.

797
00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:08.090
They said yes to all the things that interest me and then give out yards and say

798
00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:10.250
why did I decide to do who scheduled this need?

799
00:44:10.610 --> 00:44:14.570
But I actually felt great idea and it was completely different because I central

800
00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:17.920
want to do is I know the things that SMBs use,

801
00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:21.740
but it gave me an opportunity to go as another for companies in that sector

802
00:44:21.741 --> 00:44:23.400
because we all look at the larger homes.

803
00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:27.530
So it was looking at smaller companies and see how they're using the web and how

804
00:44:27.531 --> 00:44:28.730
you use them as case studies.

805
00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:32.440
So the audience almost spend the seven because that was the way to request came.

806
00:44:32.830 --> 00:44:34.380
Okay.
Thank you.

807
00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:39.320
I was thinking,

808
00:44:39.321 --> 00:44:44.321
but if the sponsorship and the fact that it's very good for the brand awareness

809
00:44:45.331 --> 00:44:49.380
that it's needed in a very initial phase of the business,

810
00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:54.570
what happens when you do something bad with this spiritual?

811
00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:59.670
So you basically a compromise your reputation in a very initial phase.

812
00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:04.500
So,
uh,
do you have an example of good,

813
00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:09.770
good example of how some business could have recovered from a bed usage of

814
00:45:10.591 --> 00:45:14.930
sponsorship?
It's very interested.
She has a reputation.

815
00:45:14.931 --> 00:45:17.630
Reputation takes a lifetime to build on a purchase seconds.

816
00:45:17.631 --> 00:45:19.940
Two things I was worried about.
If it said,

817
00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:24.830
if you think that everything you do will be public email and we'll be very

818
00:45:24.831 --> 00:45:25.850
careful about what to do.

819
00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:29.270
And that's about reputation because you lose reputation very easily.

820
00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:31.940
People are very stupid things with reputation.

821
00:45:31.941 --> 00:45:36.200
Probably one of the best examples was the,

822
00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:39.410
I've kind of got the name of the company.
It wasn't a the company.

823
00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:43.100
Do you remember when there was no going back 25 years or more?

824
00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:47.280
The company where the guy was actually injecting Tyler tablets in the states

825
00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:49.753
it was,

826
00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:55.670
I just remember the random dude he was injecting Sinai [inaudible].
Anyway,

827
00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:58.700
it made people very nervous about actually using the product and they had a

828
00:45:58.701 --> 00:46:01.640
great reputation.
They were very well known and what they did was,

829
00:46:01.641 --> 00:46:03.740
and most people will be more cognitive of crazy at the time,

830
00:46:03.741 --> 00:46:07.550
what they did was they withdrew all department from the shells and they put

831
00:46:07.551 --> 00:46:10.280
messages are very worse.
They do not use our product.
If you have it at home,

832
00:46:10.281 --> 00:46:12.670
bring it back.
We'll give you a full refund for God's sake,
don't they?

833
00:46:12.690 --> 00:46:14.630
Any tablets,
we don't know what's going on.

834
00:46:14.810 --> 00:46:16.470
You don't want anybody to die because they take them,

835
00:46:16.471 --> 00:46:21.380
I think to people in New York and we don't know what's happened.
Everybody said,

836
00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:23.630
you know,
great move from your point of view.

837
00:46:23.631 --> 00:46:24.980
Obviously they care about the customers.

838
00:46:24.981 --> 00:46:27.800
They're going to have nothing left to come back to it because we've left this

839
00:46:27.801 --> 00:46:30.920
gap and the competitors will take it over and when they came back,

840
00:46:30.921 --> 00:46:33.920
they came back with that foil seal and they said,

841
00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:35.480
so now we've made it an extra stage.

842
00:46:35.481 --> 00:46:37.700
Now you will know if anybody has tampered with these cabinets,

843
00:46:37.701 --> 00:46:40.570
you check seal should be broken before foliage will be attacked.

844
00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:43.820
It was very clever and they recovered market share and curriculum because people

845
00:46:43.821 --> 00:46:48.280
actually said they care about,
they did an example,
it wasn't got it very wrong.

846
00:46:48.290 --> 00:46:50.400
Michelle in states one,

847
00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:53.780
they the all have damage and they sent over and the prayer they got it wrong was

848
00:46:53.781 --> 00:46:57.400
from minute one.
They sent over an English chief executive,
uh,

849
00:46:57.570 --> 00:47:01.820
an English pure person a or you paid your person and a UK lawyer.

850
00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:05.150
So he had you in this state to wherever he looks like this and saw like one of

851
00:47:05.151 --> 00:47:08.300
the door,
okay,
do we have to listen the whole thing up and you get aloe,

852
00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:11.700
I'm the chief executive and I'm over here in America and I've got to solve it,

853
00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:13.010
have color.
The PR person,

854
00:47:13.011 --> 00:47:17.170
I'm over here with just common sense says a prospective country that you're in

855
00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:18.440
that that's going to reputation.

856
00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:21.100
If you actually respect your customers and that country,

857
00:47:21.130 --> 00:47:24.320
you get somebody with local eyes and ears on the ground.

858
00:47:24.321 --> 00:47:26.060
You get somebody who's American who says,

859
00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:29.290
this is how it works and this is just two English.

860
00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:33.520
This is how people will interpret what you're saying and their reputation stuff

861
00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:35.530
massively.
I'm not sure that the covered yet.

862
00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:38.050
And you'll find an awful lot of companies on the,

863
00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:40.250
or the reputation is severity damage.

864
00:47:40.251 --> 00:47:45.140
They actually come speaking meaning company because the research says you won't

865
00:47:45.141 --> 00:47:48.100
walk off with people,
will is associated with the disaster.
Hmm.

866
00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:49.840
So that they have no option.

867
00:47:50.830 --> 00:47:54.780
But it's a good example of if you don't get it right,
how much damage you can do.

868
00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:55.633
That's the other side.

869
00:47:56.620 --> 00:47:59.790
<v 2>Fantastic.
Thank you so much.
I love it.
That was amazing.</v>

870
00:47:59.791 --> 00:48:01.260
Sometimes fantastic stories.

871
00:48:01.261 --> 00:48:04.560
And I know there are a few more questions that we don't have time to get around

872
00:48:04.561 --> 00:48:05.070
to,

873
00:48:05.070 --> 00:48:08.640
but you have different ways that we can contact you that you've already shared

874
00:48:08.641 --> 00:48:11.730
with me so I can share them as with everyone else.

875
00:48:11.731 --> 00:48:13.800
So thank you again for being our first home.

876
00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:15.663
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

877
00:48:21.810 --> 00:48:24.040
<v 0>And you did say everybody chases out at 12 noon.</v>
