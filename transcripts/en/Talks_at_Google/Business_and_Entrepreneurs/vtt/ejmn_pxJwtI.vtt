00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.640
Hello and welcome everyone.
We have a very special guest with us here today,

2
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.310
all the way from Montreal.
Chances are,

3
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.950
if you've enjoyed the writings of Warren Buffett,
if you've hard check,

4
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.030
I pay speak here,

5
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.490
you are very likely going to enjoy the message that Francoise Rashawn has to

6
00:00:37.561 --> 00:00:38.430
share with us today.

7
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.260
He's one of the investors who's letters I highly admire.

8
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.120
I love reading all of your communications.
I love the clarity in your talks.

9
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.340
And the special thing for us as Googlers is,
um,

10
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.420
this is one of the most successful value investors in the world today who

11
00:00:57.421 --> 00:01:02.250
started off as an engineer.
So without giving away too much,

12
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.190
uh,
I'd like to welcome France or Russia.

13
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.200
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

14
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.690
<v 2>So,
uh,
thank you very much for inviting me.</v>

15
00:01:14.691 --> 00:01:17.560
I'm really honored to be here and uh,

16
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.160
I want to do to go do a presentation and I call it the art of investing.

17
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.340
So yes,
I was trained as an engineer.

18
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.030
I also had a very big passion for art.

19
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.150
So when I started you already capital,

20
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.530
probably you have gas that as you've already is the name of a city where they

21
00:01:36.711 --> 00:01:41.310
lived.
And so you see a little painting of 12 Monday on the,

22
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.410
the first line.
So the art of investing,
it's,

23
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.140
I call it the art of going beyond the numbers.
So,
um,

24
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.560
I got the idea really you by reading Peter Lynch book one up on Wall Street.

25
00:01:54.561 --> 00:01:59.000
And he said that investing in stocks is a nar more than science.

26
00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.900
And you know,

27
00:01:59.901 --> 00:02:04.901
people that were trained to think very rigidly to quantify everything.

28
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.170
It's a big disadvantage when they invest in the stock market.

29
00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:11.890
So we're gonna start with that.
And um,

30
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.850
so as an engineer I was trained with this scientific education.

31
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.560
So we're trained to develop a rational mind.

32
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.960
You need to understand numbers.

33
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.580
And I think it's a big advantage because there's a lot of financial belief that,

34
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.830
you know,
people that are trained in the finance business.
I think the,

35
00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.820
the learning things that I believe are not to really scientific and we don't

36
00:02:37.821 --> 00:02:39.560
need to unlearn those things,

37
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.520
but at the same time a scientific education.

38
00:02:43.521 --> 00:02:47.480
I think as some disadvantages when you,
when it comes to the stock market,

39
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.050
we're trained to look at past numbers on the belief that the future will be

40
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.020
similar human.
Sometimes it don't be a black hat on.

41
00:02:57.021 --> 00:02:59.980
So you have to understand that the financial world is

42
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.540
<v 3>a very strange world.</v>

43
00:03:01.541 --> 00:03:05.470
And when you trained to think very rigidly,

44
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.540
it's hard sometimes to understand what's happening and has a scientific,

45
00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:12.520
we're trained not to judge,

46
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.990
but to gather facts and judgment is a big part of the s talking investing

47
00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.700
process.
And also we're trained to be very precise and right,

48
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.180
but investing is about being on precise and precise and also accepting don't,

49
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.900
it'd be wrong,
30 35 40% of the time.

50
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.910
And that's a good ratio.
So I wouldn't have,

51
00:03:35.911 --> 00:03:39.430
just to put a quote via one of the great engineer of all time,

52
00:03:39.431 --> 00:03:43.810
he collect test line said that instinct is something that is important in

53
00:03:43.811 --> 00:03:46.710
science.
It transcends knowledge.
And the,

54
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.000
I think that's a very interesting a quote.

55
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.470
But at the same time there's a big difference between arts,

56
00:03:55.471 --> 00:04:00.471
science and alchemy and you know during many centuries outcome is try to change

57
00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:06.400
lab in gold and that's not really science.

58
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.170
And so this idea that I have a great feeling about that stuff,

59
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.010
that's not really our neither.
It is investing.
It's really just being lazy.

60
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.530
So if you want to be an artist and the investing world,

61
00:04:20.531 --> 00:04:23.110
well you want to master that art.

62
00:04:23.111 --> 00:04:26.470
So you want first choose a nar that true you really love,

63
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.290
you want to study the masters of that art.

64
00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.160
And also it's important that as master paints,
investor invest,

65
00:04:34.161 --> 00:04:39.161
so you want to be active in your art and you want also to develop your own style

66
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.320
of an independent mind and always try for improvements.

67
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.440
And I have this quote by Woody Allen and they said that in order to be a jazz

68
00:04:50.441 --> 00:04:54.460
musician you have to listen to jazz.
And it's,
it's an act of love.

69
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.480
You listen to music not because you want to learn it,

70
00:04:58.481 --> 00:04:59.920
but because you enjoy it.

71
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.830
And gradually you've kind of a system of Osmosis it,

72
00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.720
you know,
it learn into you.

73
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:13.230
And that's I think any art that you want to learn the have to go to it to an act

74
00:05:13.781 --> 00:05:14.614
of love.

75
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.270
And then I have this quote by Jim Collins.
He said that,
uh,

76
00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.270
you can either follow a paint by number of Kipp approach to life or you can

77
00:05:25.271 --> 00:05:27.820
decide to want to create your own masterpiece.

78
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:33.270
And in the investing world if you want to be original and you have to accept

79
00:05:35.081 --> 00:05:37.420
that probably you will be different from the others.

80
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:42.450
And we'll probably a half to be eccentric rash,

81
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.330
unconventional m that's a quote by John Maynard Keynes.

82
00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.180
He wrote a book called a state of longterm expectation,
1936.
And it's a,

83
00:05:51.181 --> 00:05:56.080
is the longterm investor that in practice will be very different from the others

84
00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:00.590
and probably criticize on some point because it says in the essence of his

85
00:06:00.591 --> 00:06:05.240
behavior that TLV eccentric rash and unconventional in the eyes of the average

86
00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.340
opinion,
that means that,
uh,

87
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.150
if you want to obtain better results in the stock market,

88
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.510
you have to be able to stand in your own and you'll be different than the

89
00:06:14.511 --> 00:06:17.780
typical crowd of investor.
And that's sometimes hard to,

90
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.230
it's fun when you look at that picture.
Uh,
but,
uh,

91
00:06:21.231 --> 00:06:24.380
it's sometimes the whole heart because you have to be different than that

92
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.640
African,
sometimes a very contrarian opinion than the average view on this,

93
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.000
either a stock or the stock market in general.

94
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:36.920
So let's look at the results of money managers in general in our investing
world.

95
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:37.430
Those,

96
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:42.430
so that's the normal bell curve of the typical results has investors.

97
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:48.760
And this line here is the SNP 500 and the s and p 500 is not right in the middle

98
00:06:49.551 --> 00:06:53.810
for this.
It's very simple reason that managers charge fees.

99
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.490
So they,
you know,
from scratch,
they owe their start from the,
uh,

100
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:03.020
probably one or 2% of the ids and p 500.
So just because of that,

101
00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:08.210
the SNP 500 probably beats up 85% of the investors.

102
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:13.810
So you want always to think what not to do if you want to beat the index.

103
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.110
So if you want to beat the normal distribution,

104
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:24.050
what do you want not to do while if you think the same ways as most investors

105
00:07:24.051 --> 00:07:28.220
and you have the same time Arisun who probably,
and I would the same results.

106
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:31.610
So also if you own lots of companies,

107
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.310
it's very hard to differ from the index.

108
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:39.730
And I would have to that if you believe that you're smarter than the others and

109
00:07:39.981 --> 00:07:44.180
you can predict the stock market,
I think a,
it's a road to failure.

110
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:49.460
So what do you want to do if you want to be the normal curve?
Well,

111
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:54.730
so far and the last 24 years we've probably been in the top 1% on investors.

112
00:07:56.450 --> 00:08:00.020
So that's hope it's not pure luck.
And uh,

113
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:04.580
that we do have an investment approach that helps up to be the index.

114
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:08.840
So what do we do?
We tried to think for ourselves,

115
00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:14.380
we try to be own very few selected companies and develop the right behaviors,

116
00:08:15.951 --> 00:08:19.390
which I'll go through a little later.
But these are rationality,

117
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.840
humility and patience.

118
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.800
So perhaps we can go to our stock selection process.

119
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:26.840
So that's the science part of it.

120
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:30.200
So we started with this financial strength of the companies.

121
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:34.340
We want companies that have higher return on capital that grown their earnings

122
00:08:34.341 --> 00:08:38.600
per share that also at the same time I've had strong balance sheets of the deck

123
00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:39.560
to profit ratio.

124
00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:44.540
Usually you would want some tag lesson four times and we want a business model

125
00:08:44.541 --> 00:08:45.740
that is very solid.

126
00:08:45.741 --> 00:08:50.741
So we want companies that are market leaders that af competitive advantage and

127
00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:54.480
low cyclicality and the competitive advantage is very important.

128
00:08:54.481 --> 00:08:59.220
Then I'll go back to that point a little later.
The management team.

129
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:04.260
So we want,
uh,
you know,
the CEO,
the CFO,
the high,

130
00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:08.550
the high management team to own lots of shares in the company.

131
00:09:08.551 --> 00:09:12.630
So you want a high level of ownership.
So they really in the same boat as we are.

132
00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:18.270
Uh,
we want,
you know,
managers that have good capital allocation skills.

133
00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:21.030
They make constructive acquisitions and you know,

134
00:09:21.031 --> 00:09:24.420
they really think long term when they make investments.

135
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.120
And then we have market valuation.

136
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:32.080
So we want to start that will purchase at a level that,
you know,

137
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.170
we can double our money over five years,

138
00:09:34.171 --> 00:09:38.160
which is something that a 15% annual return.
So,
you know,

139
00:09:38.161 --> 00:09:42.930
without being very precise because we know that probably is an illusion and when

140
00:09:42.931 --> 00:09:44.340
you try to be too precise,

141
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:49.230
we tried to have a view of what we think the company can earn in five years and

142
00:09:49.231 --> 00:09:54.160
it's going to help us to moralize what kind of valuation and we can expect,
uh,

143
00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:58.410
during that time.
Few words about art.

144
00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:03.560
At first I want to say that art and beauty are in some ways until are

145
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:08.040
interrelated.
And you know,
very few money managers talk about beauty,

146
00:10:08.041 --> 00:10:11.850
but I think it's important.
How do you define beauty in the investment world?

147
00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:16.950
Why would we say that?
Beauty usually to our eyes.
It's something I,
it's rare.

148
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:20.910
We usually find something beautiful when it's something that we sell them.
See.

149
00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:22.343
So,

150
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:27.770
and something that is unique is we never see.

151
00:10:27.841 --> 00:10:32.550
So it's really the rarest of all the beauties.
And I always,

152
00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:36.930
sometimes when I read an annual report and look at the numbers when I have this

153
00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:40.890
feelings,
while this is a beautiful company,

154
00:10:40.891 --> 00:10:42.690
it turns high return on capital.

155
00:10:42.691 --> 00:10:46.470
It has much better margin than their competitors.
You know,
this,

156
00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:48.450
that's something that lights up in my mind.

157
00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:53.970
So what you want is to find what I call masterpieces.

158
00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:57.210
And they have one quality.
They're rare and unique.

159
00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.950
So I've taken some example in the art world.

160
00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:04.500
So the Monalisa a Rothko painting events on Van Gogh painting.

161
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:10.020
And if you want to take some example of business masterpieces while I've gone to

162
00:11:10.021 --> 00:11:13.950
the history of the capitalist world,
mostly in the u s and you know,

163
00:11:13.951 --> 00:11:18.951
we can start with probably the one of the first technology company in the 1880s

164
00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:23.060
called national cash register.
That's probably heard of,
uh,
uh,

165
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:27.150
your attacker that many years ago,
whether a very innovative company,

166
00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:32.220
apple,
Ika,
uh,
Tj Maxx,
Geico,

167
00:11:32.221 --> 00:11:37.200
the other insurance company owned by Berkshire,
a Washington Post HR block,

168
00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:40.830
Donlin brasserie [inaudible] to McDonald's,
Starbucks.

169
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.490
I think all these companies,
and we could certainly add Google the,
that cloth.

170
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:46.870
These are business masterpieces.

171
00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:51.210
So you want to study those kinds of businesses and see what do they have that

172
00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:56.211
was so unique and the uniqueness and either the product or the service or the

173
00:11:56.711 --> 00:12:01.711
culture is equivalent of having a boat that protect your castle,

174
00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:06.220
your economy,
Castle from invaders,
which you know,
our competitors.

175
00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:08.170
So that's a key thing.

176
00:12:08.171 --> 00:12:12.470
You want to own a mode with lots of crocodiles and parents,
piranhas and it,

177
00:12:12.471 --> 00:12:16.780
so you know,
competitors don't want to come near your castle.

178
00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:23.190
So if we could resume kind of what we look for in a company,

179
00:12:23.441 --> 00:12:27.520
it's really tree things.
And the competitive advantages,

180
00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:32.950
which we could say is the artistic part of that.
The financial strength,

181
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:36.670
which is really the science part and the management team.

182
00:12:36.671 --> 00:12:39.100
And this is where judgment comes into play.

183
00:12:39.101 --> 00:12:42.730
It's very important to be able to judge management.
And you know,

184
00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.000
that's kind of subjective thing when you're talking about judgment.

185
00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:51.640
But you know how we say,
I have this phrase that when you meet the management,

186
00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:56.200
you ask yourself,
would I like this man who married my daughter?

187
00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:00.850
And if their answer is yes,
it's probably a good man to,
to be partner with.

188
00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:06.810
So we ended up with something 125 stocks that fit that criteria was,

189
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:11.980
and the one that we do buy for the portfolio are the ones that fit our criteria

190
00:13:11.981 --> 00:13:16.900
as in terms of market valuation that we can buy at a price today that we hope we

191
00:13:16.901 --> 00:13:19.900
can earn some pay 15% going forward yearly.

192
00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:25.540
So perhaps just take a few examples,
uh,
for,
uh,
to,
uh,

193
00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.100
to illustrate our approach.

194
00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:30.770
While one company I think is very unique is a Walt Disney.

195
00:13:30.771 --> 00:13:35.020
They have great brand name,
they own the star wars franchise.
Uh,

196
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:40.090
the own of course hold those are historical stars like Mickey Mouse and we need

197
00:13:40.091 --> 00:13:44.260
a pool.
And they bought marvel a few years back.
And,
um,
you know,

198
00:13:44.261 --> 00:13:48.760
I always say that Mickey Mouse says tree great qualities.
Uh,

199
00:13:48.761 --> 00:13:52.990
first is highly popular,
very unknown all around the world.

200
00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.980
Second is immortal and the third he has no agent.

201
00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:59.740
So you really own your star.

202
00:13:59.741 --> 00:14:04.741
And that's a great thing for Disney and the unique in this a business model of

203
00:14:05.621 --> 00:14:08.760
Disney is that they have these um,

204
00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:14.640
big movie blockbusters and like how Alison Wonderland in 1951 and then 50 years

205
00:14:16.181 --> 00:14:20.830
later and they can redo a new version and make money again with the same name.

206
00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:23.650
And they did that recently with the jungle book.
Uh,

207
00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:27.930
they released their first animated version in 1967 and they did a real live

208
00:14:27.931 --> 00:14:30.610
version last year,
which shows we'll also a big success.

209
00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:35.440
So it's kind of like a owning an oil field while you take all the oil and 50

210
00:14:35.441 --> 00:14:40.180
years later you go back to the field and there's even more new oil to take out

211
00:14:40.181 --> 00:14:44.830
and don't need to spend money on capital and you know,
pay people to,
to,

212
00:14:44.831 --> 00:14:48.430
to guard your field.
It's really an extraordinary business model.

213
00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:53.670
We bought that stock probably 11,
12 years ago.
Uh,

214
00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:57.890
I think in 2005,
we paid about $24 and it was,
uh,

215
00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:02.570
the date above Iger wasn't Mco and that we've done it since then.

216
00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:07.340
So there was a period when this stock did not do much.
As you can see before,

217
00:15:07.341 --> 00:15:11.000
years of stock didn't do very well,
but earnings kept growing.

218
00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:12.710
And we were a patient.
And the,

219
00:15:12.711 --> 00:15:16.190
if you look over the 12 years we've owned this top,
her name is,

220
00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:20.780
I've grown about 13% annually and then the end of the stock has a more than

221
00:15:20.781 --> 00:15:21.560
quadruple.

222
00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:26.560
So if your patient and companies grew there,

223
00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:30.860
if their value,
eventually this talk will follow.

224
00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:36.020
I want to take another example of a stock that's been a one portfolio,
a carmax.

225
00:15:36.021 --> 00:15:39.050
It's been 10 years in the portfolio and that has,

226
00:15:39.051 --> 00:15:44.051
you can see earnings per share of corona of about 16% annually since we bought

227
00:15:44.751 --> 00:15:49.490
it in 2007.
And the stock has done very similar.

228
00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:54.410
Uh,
even though the p ratio is a little lower today than when we first bought it,

229
00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:58.010
we first bought into the summer of 2007.
At that time,

230
00:15:58.011 --> 00:16:02.000
the Pe ratio was about 24 times.

231
00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:07.300
We bought more shares in 2011 and that 14 times and more shares in 2016 again at

232
00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:10.480
14 times.
And today the stock is about 18 times earnings.

233
00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:15.830
So even though the p ratio has been reduced a bit all over the years,

234
00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:19.980
the stock has done pretty well.
It's not about 13% annually.
Uh,

235
00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:23.690
even though earnings grow grew about 16% on early,

236
00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:27.440
and that's about a 5% better than the s and p 500.

237
00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:31.670
They've been an included as done about 8% annually over the last decade.

238
00:16:31.671 --> 00:16:34.990
So it's been a good investment.
Um,

239
00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:39.820
I want to say few words about a competitive advantage as investors at Giverny.

240
00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:44.420
What kind of competitive advantage can we have?
Well,
first,

241
00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:50.000
um,
I think it's tree things,
patients your and rationality,

242
00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:52.520
a humility.

243
00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:57.970
I think we do believe that it's impossible to predict macroeconomic events,

244
00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:03.770
so we don't try to predict them.
Uh,
also one key element,

245
00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:08.920
a key element is to focus on your circle of competence and to know where the

246
00:17:09.021 --> 00:17:12.230
limits of that circle is.
And thirdly,

247
00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:17.030
we want to recognize our mistakes when we do them and always try to improve our

248
00:17:17.031 --> 00:17:18.620
stock selection process.

249
00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.200
A few awards on the timing of purchases.
I would the guy and uh,

250
00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:26.000
said that the 80% of success is showing up.

251
00:17:26.001 --> 00:17:30.500
And so that's one of the main reason we always want to be invested in the stock

252
00:17:30.501 --> 00:17:34.040
market because we believe that owning great companies,

253
00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:39.100
not trying to predict the stock market is the key thing to be able to beat the

254
00:17:39.441 --> 00:17:44.000
index over the long run.
And by always striving for improvement,

255
00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:47.180
we try to study a mistakes in details.

256
00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.720
So each year on an annual that,

257
00:17:49.721 --> 00:17:53.730
or we have this yearly metals that we give to our best mistakes,

258
00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:58.470
then it's a very popular part of our annual letter.
I don't know why,
but uh,

259
00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:03.240
uh,
because it's very painful.
But,
uh,
I think that's very important.

260
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:07.950
If you want to continue to improve yourself.
A few words on rationality.

261
00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:11.160
Uh,
we try not to be affected when others make more money to,

262
00:18:11.161 --> 00:18:15.270
I'm not asking stops because there's always fans and you know,

263
00:18:15.271 --> 00:18:18.390
we don't get into fat.
So sometimes we'll be,
you know,

264
00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:23.670
different from what's going on in the very popular part of the soft market.
But,

265
00:18:23.671 --> 00:18:26.130
you know,
we try to be rational and say,
well,
if it's,

266
00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:30.470
if we don't really understand it,
if we can,
don't think that's a,
you know,

267
00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:33.780
a good area,
what we are,
where our capital should be invested,

268
00:18:33.781 --> 00:18:34.980
we just take you away from it.

269
00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:38.160
And we tried to be improved and used to the stock market,

270
00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:39.750
a quotation in the short run.

271
00:18:39.751 --> 00:18:43.530
So it takes a lot of rationality because the stock market can be very,

272
00:18:43.531 --> 00:18:48.060
very volatile.
So,
uh,
we try to always be,
uh,

273
00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:49.170
you know,
uh,

274
00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:54.170
calm and trying to always have to high on the long term horizons of the company

275
00:18:54.721 --> 00:18:58.320
we purchase and we accept that we don't know the future.

276
00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:01.230
And we tried to focus on,
you know,

277
00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:06.540
part of the process that we can control.
It's really to,
like I said,

278
00:19:06.541 --> 00:19:10.830
to look for companies that we understand that we believe that have a competitive

279
00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:14.700
in a ditch and you know,
we accept that we don't know exactly I'll,

280
00:19:14.701 --> 00:19:17.550
things were workout.
But you know,

281
00:19:17.551 --> 00:19:21.360
if you own great companies with great managers,
eventually you should be okay.

282
00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:26.700
And that comes up too is something we,
uh,
we put out a few years back,

283
00:19:26.701 --> 00:19:28.530
I call it the rule of three.

284
00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:33.060
It's really to accept that one year out of the three to stock markets will

285
00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:34.620
declining by 10% or more.

286
00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:40.180
One stop purchase out of three will not perform as expected and one year out of

287
00:19:40.411 --> 00:19:42.300
three you will underperform the index.

288
00:19:42.301 --> 00:19:46.260
Then that's the best manager is usually underperform one year of three.

289
00:19:46.261 --> 00:19:51.180
So it's a,
it's still a very ambitious,
a rule,
a group of rule.
But,

290
00:19:51.181 --> 00:19:53.670
uh,
if you accept that from the start,

291
00:19:53.671 --> 00:19:57.240
when you'll have some bad years on some bad investments,

292
00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:00.720
you'll be better prepared psychologically to deal with that.

293
00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:05.040
And the few word on patients,
well,

294
00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:08.520
the saying that a patient is not the ability to wait,

295
00:20:08.521 --> 00:20:11.280
but the ability to keep a good attitude while waiting.

296
00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:14.430
So what's the good attitude in the investment world?

297
00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:17.580
It's really to focus on what's happening the company.

298
00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:21.960
That's what's happening to the stock.
And that's a sometimes a hard thing to do.

299
00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:24.570
But if you go back to the example of Carmax,

300
00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:27.810
carmax stock over the last decade has been quite volatile.

301
00:20:27.811 --> 00:20:29.970
It went down 25% a few times.

302
00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:33.600
But if you look at the earnings over those 10 years,

303
00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:35.610
it's been a pretty stable business.

304
00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:39.900
So if you just focus on what's happened to car Max over the last 10 years,

305
00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:45.710
I think beside 2009 earnings went up every year and it grow are earnings by more

306
00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:51.450
than the percent early.
So just focus on that and forget about the,

307
00:20:51.451 --> 00:20:56.240
the stock price movements you'll be okay.
But,
uh,

308
00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:58.720
I want to say another word about patients.

309
00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:01.090
That's not the same thing as being stubborn.

310
00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:05.140
And sometimes we fail to recognize mistakes we make.

311
00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:08.810
So I like to think about the analogy of a,

312
00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:12.400
how do you get the frog to be cooked?

313
00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:16.570
If you put it in boiling water,
it will jump out of the bowls.

314
00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:18.310
So what you do,

315
00:21:18.311 --> 00:21:22.840
you put it on a mild water and slowly increase of temperature and you know the

316
00:21:22.841 --> 00:21:26.560
frog one get out because she always think while things are getting a little

317
00:21:26.561 --> 00:21:30.460
hotter,
but they'll cooldowns eventually.
So,
and you know,

318
00:21:30.461 --> 00:21:32.770
it never cools down and eventually get cooked.

319
00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:36.910
So what you want is not to buy a stock and you know,

320
00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:41.190
earning is a little disappointing.
Different metals start to deteriorate,

321
00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:45.790
the stock go down,
but you don't want to sell out a loss.
So,
uh,

322
00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:48.940
when you know,
investment doesn't work very well,

323
00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:54.570
I try to focus on what's happening to the company and to be sure that I'm not

324
00:21:54.701 --> 00:21:58.630
getting,
you know,
Cook like a frog.
And that's really,

325
00:21:58.720 --> 00:21:59.710
that's really important.

326
00:21:59.711 --> 00:22:04.711
And there's a big difference and knowing when to keep your shares because of

327
00:22:05.131 --> 00:22:06.070
fundamentals,

328
00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:10.960
warrants it and recognize who made a mistake and just get out of that stock.

329
00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:15.610
And that's a big,
that's a big difference between being patient and stubborn.

330
00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:18.760
So,
um,

331
00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:23.910
to summarize what differentiate an artistic investor and let's say the

332
00:22:24.791 --> 00:22:28.150
conventional investor,
that typical investor in the stock market,

333
00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:30.470
either professional or a Matar,

334
00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:35.350
it's really the focus on market quotes.
There are short term oriented,

335
00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:37.330
do you have opinion on everything?

336
00:22:37.331 --> 00:22:42.331
And they tried to predict when to buy stocks and the cannot resist the latest

337
00:22:42.821 --> 00:22:46.300
fad.
So I would say the end conventional investor,

338
00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:49.330
while he focuses on intrinsic value,

339
00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:53.440
you as a long term horizon is agnostic about many,

340
00:22:53.441 --> 00:22:58.210
many things including where the stock market will be in a few weeks or a few

341
00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:02.470
months.
And at the same time he doesn't try to predict when to buy,

342
00:23:02.471 --> 00:23:04.930
but he focuses more on what to buy.

343
00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:08.530
And I wouldn't say the right verb is what to own.

344
00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:14.340
And of course he rescinded you resist the fads and the popular group and it's

345
00:23:14.591 --> 00:23:16.390
easy to ride in a present nation,

346
00:23:16.391 --> 00:23:20.740
but it's harder on the day to day to resist or what's been very popular.

347
00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:24.880
So that takes a lot of independence of thought ever leave.

348
00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:30.610
So why it's an investor must be able to kind of balance many things.

349
00:23:30.611 --> 00:23:33.220
So I talked about the law of,
for the art,

350
00:23:33.221 --> 00:23:36.040
but that same time you want to be very rational.

351
00:23:36.041 --> 00:23:40.840
You don't want to fall in love with stocks.
You,
you want us always be rational.

352
00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:44.500
You want to have a very large fields of knowledge and,

353
00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:47.360
and we'll look at many,
many companies,

354
00:23:47.361 --> 00:23:51.050
but at the same times you want to focus on your circle of competence.

355
00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.090
You want to be open minded.

356
00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:56.030
But at the same time you have to have independence of thoughts.

357
00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:00.320
We want to be able to value the business.
But at the same time,

358
00:24:00.321 --> 00:24:02.270
like I said in this British Sinn Fein has changed.

359
00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:06.350
You want to be able to go beyond the numbers.
So he's just not numbers.

360
00:24:06.351 --> 00:24:09.530
If it was just numbers and that the mission mathematician would all be

361
00:24:09.531 --> 00:24:14.000
billionaires.
So of course it takes a little more than that.
Um,

362
00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:15.320
you have to have patience,

363
00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:18.050
but as the same time don't want to give cooked like a frog.

364
00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:22.510
And finally you want discipline,
but you want to be able to bring the rules.

365
00:24:22.511 --> 00:24:26.900
So I always say that the discipline is to follow your own rules,

366
00:24:26.901 --> 00:24:30.830
but wisdom is to know when to break your own rules.
So sometimes we've,

367
00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:35.240
we've bought some stock that didn't really fit our criteria was,
but you know,

368
00:24:35.241 --> 00:24:38.630
we made the judgment call that we believe most of the time,

369
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:42.800
either the business has really something special or the management that's really

370
00:24:42.801 --> 00:24:47.090
something special or ideally both.
So finally,

371
00:24:47.091 --> 00:24:51.290
to summarize in one sentence,
to obtain better results than the others,

372
00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:53.200
I would call the John Templeton.

373
00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:57.260
He said that you have to do something different from the others and you have any

374
00:24:57.261 --> 00:25:01.460
capital.
What do we do differently?
Well,
first we think independently.

375
00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:06.440
We own very few selected company.
We have a very long term horizon,

376
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:10.580
I mean a thing on the average.
And we own our stocks seven years.

377
00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:13.730
And the typical investor on Wall Street's at seven months.

378
00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:18.200
So that's kind of a 12th who onward 12 to one ratio.

379
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:23.930
And also we tried to develop the right behaviors.
Gree,
you want to be rational,

380
00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:28.430
humble,
and patient.
So That's control the presentation.

381
00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:32.270
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Fantastic.

382
00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:38.490
<v 0>So folks,
I'm gonna read something for you guys.</v>

383
00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:42.600
I think you might find this interesting.
So good business plan.

384
00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:47.460
Our business women are like artists.
They have to do something with passion,

385
00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:52.610
something innovative and unique that will last and that will inspire others.

386
00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:55.800
In the final process,

387
00:25:55.980 --> 00:26:00.980
I try to figure out how much this marvelous companies should be worked and try

388
00:26:01.541 --> 00:26:03.210
to buy it in the market.

389
00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:08.230
F at half of what I believe it should trade in five years if everything goes as

390
00:26:09.451 --> 00:26:12.630
planned,
which is about 15% a year.

391
00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:18.920
So these two paragraphs are from an interview of France who are in the year 2005

392
00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:25.360
and I'm sure it,

393
00:26:25.361 --> 00:26:30.030
it's kind of obvious how consistent your philosophy has been over the years.

394
00:26:30.031 --> 00:26:31.140
It's remarkable.

395
00:26:31.141 --> 00:26:36.141
It's sort of in the Francoise Roshaun of 2005 would have probably given the same

396
00:26:37.951 --> 00:26:42.900
talk in very similar words as I can tell.
So what I want to ask you is,

397
00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:47.190
has it been easy for you to follow this approach consistently?

398
00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.680
Has it been tested over the years?

399
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:54.000
Have there been times where you've questioned and sort of how you've thought

400
00:26:54.001 --> 00:26:54.280
about it?

401
00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:59.230
<v 2>These things.
Yeah,
it's fantastic because I can,
like I said,</v>

402
00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:02.950
we have to accept that we underperform one year that was the tree.

403
00:27:02.951 --> 00:27:06.610
And you know,
in the good years it's easy to say,

404
00:27:06.611 --> 00:27:11.320
but when those barriers happen,
uh,
it's really painful.
And you know,

405
00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:16.300
when you have some partners,
uh,
while the words you use for clients,

406
00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:20.760
uh,
you have to explain to them where,
why you have a bad year and uh,

407
00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:24.490
sometimes can be tough and it can last more than one year.

408
00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:27.670
It can be two or three years in a row.
So that's a,

409
00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:31.270
I think it takes a lot of conviction that uh,

410
00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:35.080
you're on the right path and you're doing what you think is the best for you

411
00:27:35.081 --> 00:27:39.280
know,
your partners.
And then,
uh,
uh,
I think if the,

412
00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:45.010
if the principles are sound eventually,
uh,
the,
there were workout.

413
00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:48.340
So again,
the importance of our patients,

414
00:27:48.341 --> 00:27:51.760
I think that's probably the most important quality you need when you invest in

415
00:27:51.761 --> 00:27:52.594
the stock market.

416
00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.280
<v 0>So two people who are listening to this talk,</v>

417
00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:57.710
there might be young graduate students,

418
00:27:57.711 --> 00:28:02.090
people who are getting into the investing profession or a lot of individual

419
00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:06.380
investors like ourselves who are saying,
this is a good approach.

420
00:28:06.381 --> 00:28:09.140
Maybe I want to try it.
And you know,

421
00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:12.710
they could have a couple of bad years to start off with.
And uh,
uh,

422
00:28:12.711 --> 00:28:13.940
what is your advice there?

423
00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:20.080
<v 2>Um,
I think there's the patients also.
It's Pr,</v>

424
00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:22.120
it's important of course,
but I think the,

425
00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:26.050
there's a quality behind patients and s humility.

426
00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:31.090
You have to accept that you'll make some mistakes and there's always things that

427
00:28:31.091 --> 00:28:35.320
you can learn.
And how I would say that,
uh,
the greatest quality,

428
00:28:35.321 --> 00:28:38.980
Warren Buffett is not necessarily an intelligence is the humility.
I mean,

429
00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:42.250
he's the greatest investor of all time is a greatest wall,

430
00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:47.260
but it's still very humble,
always looking to improve and learn.

431
00:28:47.261 --> 00:28:49.810
And I think that's six greatest qualities,

432
00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:54.820
87 years old and he's still striving for new,

433
00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:57.130
uh,
new learning every day.

434
00:28:57.131 --> 00:29:00.880
You always want to learn new things and understand new things.

435
00:29:00.881 --> 00:29:05.230
And if you have those qualities,
I think that's a,

436
00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:08.380
I think you,
you'll succeed in almost every anything.
Yeah,

437
00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.920
<v 0>you do.
That's very interesting because you know,</v>

438
00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:15.030
he's been quoted to have said in interviews that if you have an Iq of 160,

439
00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:18.600
you might be better off giving 10 points to say,
I think you said selling.

440
00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:25.240
Selling.
Sure.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Yeah.

441
00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:27.840
So you do believe that,
you know,
it's more than the Iq,

442
00:29:27.841 --> 00:29:32.260
it's the behavioral traits after a point that are critical.
Yeah.
Okay.
Um,

443
00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:36.450
so any advice to individual investors,

444
00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:40.200
young investors who might not be professional investors like yourself?

445
00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.740
What are some best practices

446
00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:44.180
<v 2>can adopt?
Um,</v>

447
00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:48.290
I think,
yeah,
you have,

448
00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:52.700
first you have to look for company yet you can't understand because there's
many,

449
00:29:52.701 --> 00:29:57.110
many companies out there,
there's thousands and thousands and you know,

450
00:29:57.290 --> 00:30:02.030
it's hard to really understand all of those companies and some are just very,

451
00:30:02.031 --> 00:30:02.960
very complicated.

452
00:30:02.961 --> 00:30:07.961
So you're trying to play a hard game when you want to be able to value every

453
00:30:08.421 --> 00:30:09.254
company.

454
00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:14.440
You play an easier game when you're very selective and you just go for companies

455
00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:19.920
that you can understand that it goes back to the analogy of a Ted Williams that

456
00:30:20.181 --> 00:30:24.620
he wanted to wait for the perfect pitch that was in the sweet spot zone.

457
00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:28.490
And uh,
I think that's the beautiful thing of thing about the stock market.

458
00:30:28.491 --> 00:30:29.840
Then Warren Buffett said that many,

459
00:30:29.841 --> 00:30:34.530
many years ago that the investing is a greatest business of all because,
uh,

460
00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:38.150
that's the one you can choose the ball you wanna hit.

461
00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:42.050
So you have to luxury of sending at the plate and you know,

462
00:30:42.051 --> 00:30:45.530
we're waiting for the perfect ball.
There's no cold strike.
And that's,

463
00:30:45.531 --> 00:30:48.470
I think the most beautiful thing in the investment business.

464
00:30:48.471 --> 00:30:52.970
But at the same time,
um,
it's a very competitive and vesting world.

465
00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:55.430
So there's some disadvantage do.

466
00:30:55.431 --> 00:30:59.690
But if you have the right behavior,
the right approach,

467
00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:03.380
and you're very patient and very,
uh,
selective,

468
00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:07.040
I think in the end you'll,
you'll succeed.

469
00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:11.360
<v 0>Great.
So in your presentation fracture,
you said,
uh,
you know,</v>

470
00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:14.550
there's an element of beauty sometimes you recognize it.
Yeah.

471
00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:18.270
And you also say that there is science and mathematics of investing.

472
00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:22.690
And I was wondering if we could take,
you know,
one company as an example.
Uh,

473
00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:27.600
one of the logos on your
slides was I think Starbucks.

474
00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:31.740
Yeah.
Um,
and I'm sure like a lot of people here recognize the company.

475
00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:35.670
So can you describe what you see in terms of,
you know,
the qualitative,

476
00:31:35.671 --> 00:31:38.580
the beauty,
like aspects and you know,
like you said,

477
00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:41.310
what are the earning potential is five years from now?

478
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:44.890
<v 2>Yeah.
Well,
uh,
Starbucks,
I looked at it,</v>

479
00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:49.090
I think the first time was in 1994.
And,
uh,

480
00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:54.280
I thought that was a unique business.
And I remember coming to the u s uh,

481
00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:56.460
in the early nineties,
and you know,

482
00:31:56.860 --> 00:32:01.750
drinking coffee and the hotels and was in a bad coffee.
And you know,

483
00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:06.130
I said,
well,
if you go any telly,
you are,
yeah,
in France you have great coffee,

484
00:32:06.131 --> 00:32:09.030
but you can to the greatest country in the world and you,

485
00:32:09.031 --> 00:32:11.920
your drink bad coffee and says it didn't make sense.

486
00:32:11.921 --> 00:32:15.070
And when I first try Starbuck,
I said,
well,

487
00:32:15.071 --> 00:32:18.910
these people aren't do something and they'll do well.

488
00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:21.760
And that I remember,
uh,

489
00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:27.270
I mean the Howard Schultz was a very ambitious and very driven,

490
00:32:27.641 --> 00:32:32.140
the CEO.
And he was very confident that it could be Starbucks,

491
00:32:32.141 --> 00:32:36.250
could have thousands and thousands and thousands of coffee,
uh,

492
00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:40.730
uh,
stands everywhere in us and in the world.
And,
um,

493
00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:42.590
I thought the,

494
00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:47.900
I thought it was indeed possible and the Ozo coffee better than Tim Horton's.

495
00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:52.600
Oh yeah.
But you know,
I want to be pitched me,
I'll take you here.

496
00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:56.680
Say a Tim Hortons it a great company also because it's getting again,
but the,

497
00:32:57.230 --> 00:33:01.490
you know,
if I had to have coffee,
I'll go work at Starbucks.
And the,
you know,

498
00:33:01.491 --> 00:33:06.491
the only thing that prevented me to invest 23 years ago was the p ratio

499
00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:10.880
Starbuck.
And I remember it was trading at 40 times earnings.
And you know,

500
00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:13.460
that was way too high for me,
but I don't know,

501
00:33:13.461 --> 00:33:15.890
I didn't look lately because it's too painful,

502
00:33:15.891 --> 00:33:18.050
but the stock is probably a hundred fold since then.

503
00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:22.670
So it's been a wonderful company,
a wonderful stock,
and never owned it.

504
00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:24.750
<v 0>So what penetration,
you know,</v>

505
00:33:24.751 --> 00:33:28.960
40 is maybe too expensive with what might be a PE ratio?
Very good marriage,

506
00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:29.360
Europe

507
00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:32.280
<v 2>pension.
Well,
with some insight,</v>

508
00:33:32.281 --> 00:33:37.050
I would say that 40 times earnings in 94 was cheap because you know,

509
00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:40.140
it didn't at all this candida future growth would come,

510
00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:43.430
but you want a big margin of safety.
And um,

511
00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:49.100
I think was in 1949 that Ben Graham said that the cornerstone of a on the

512
00:33:49.171 --> 00:33:52.290
intelligent investing is margin of safety.

513
00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:55.590
So if you pay a very high p reassure,

514
00:33:55.591 --> 00:33:59.220
you don't have as much safety as you,
if you pay a lower p ratio.

515
00:33:59.221 --> 00:34:03.900
But is it 20,
is it 25 is it's 15.

516
00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:08.100
That's where the judgment comes into play to help you design.

517
00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:12.220
<v 0>No,
I think I'm trying to sort of make it more practical for people who are</v>

518
00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:16.660
listening just to,
um,
you know,
I think today it's like 23,

519
00:34:16.661 --> 00:34:20.710
24 times PE ratio.
And,
uh,

520
00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:25.450
would that sort of a metric,
bring it,
Eh,
you know,
you said you had 125,

521
00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:28.210
would it come up in those for you to look at,
for example?

522
00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:33.220
<v 2>Well,
I think,
uh,
management is great.
I think the business model is great.
Uh,</v>

523
00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:36.580
just have to ask yourself where it is today.

524
00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:41.560
Will they be able to continue to grow at a superior growth rate going forward?

525
00:34:41.561 --> 00:34:46.390
Which I would define 12% or more.
Uh,
I mean,
every company,

526
00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:49.120
even the greatest companies in the whole history,

527
00:34:49.121 --> 00:34:53.440
they come to a point where they hit maturity and it's harder to grow at the

528
00:34:53.441 --> 00:34:57.010
higher a high growth rate.
So I mean,

529
00:34:57.011 --> 00:35:00.310
growing earnings at eight or nine or 10%,

530
00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:05.560
that's still quite an achievement,
but it's not as,
uh,
you know,

531
00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:09.580
exciting growing at 15% or more a year.

532
00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:12.730
So it's kind of be probably harder for Starbucks.

533
00:35:12.731 --> 00:35:15.670
But I've been saying that for a few years that being wrong so far.
So,

534
00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:19.630
<v 0>so maybe let's just take a step back.
Funds for the audience here.</v>

535
00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:22.760
What are some areas in the market where you do see,
you know,

536
00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:25.750
both the elements of beauty and out of value today?

537
00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:26.620
<v 2>Uh,</v>

538
00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:31.300
well I think we took the example of Carmax and I think that's a company that I

539
00:35:31.301 --> 00:35:35.710
believe can grow by about 15% annually for many,

540
00:35:35.711 --> 00:35:37.240
many years.
Revenues,

541
00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:41.970
earnings while probably earnings or revenue is for me closer to 10%.

542
00:35:41.971 --> 00:35:43.800
But you know with some,

543
00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:47.090
some margin expansion and some by backup chair,

544
00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:51.180
the thing they can attain at 15% growth in earnings per share and then trades

545
00:35:51.181 --> 00:35:56.070
that 18 times earnings.
So the PE ratio is similar than the market,

546
00:35:56.100 --> 00:36:01.050
but the thing that growth profile is probably twice as twice as good.
Okay.

547
00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:02.580
Now I have

548
00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:07.330
<v 0>a couple of questions.
Just typically we ask all of our guests,
um,</v>

549
00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:11.940
what are some of your favorite like managers or business people that you look
at?

550
00:36:11.941 --> 00:36:15.150
And then the second part of the question is what are some books,
you know,

551
00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:17.160
investing in non and last thing that you learned,

552
00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:22.170
<v 2>joy that you might want to share with us?
Well managers,
um,</v>

553
00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:27.570
well I have a deep respect for mark and there that constellation software,

554
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:30.430
I think he's a really,
he's an artist.

555
00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:36.550
He's really unique,
is a really original and uh,
and uh,

556
00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:40.470
he has a very,
very long term horizon and everything he does.

557
00:36:40.471 --> 00:36:44.970
And I think constellation software,
which you know,
is a Canadian company,

558
00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:50.250
uh,
I think,
uh,
I hope it continues to be,

559
00:36:50.251 --> 00:36:52.830
but uh,
if you looked at it today,
it's really a masterpiece.

560
00:36:52.831 --> 00:36:57.831
It's really something quite unique and a great culture and great artists at the

561
00:36:58.531 --> 00:36:59.170
Ham.

562
00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:03.090
<v 0>It's interesting you bring it up cause it's a technology company typically by</v>

563
00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:04.930
learn westerners sort of,
you know,

564
00:37:04.931 --> 00:37:09.430
they've had this rough interaction with like being in technology versus not

565
00:37:09.431 --> 00:37:14.260
being there.
And also it's one of those companies that has grown by acquisitions.

566
00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:18.570
Uh,
which again,
value investors tend to shy away from.
So how do you look at those

567
00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:22.120
<v 2>two aspects?
I say there's many ways to get rich.
So</v>

568
00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:28.360
Starbucks is just having one concept and they could clone it thousand times.

569
00:37:28.361 --> 00:37:31.720
And others company,
I mean,
Berkshire Hathaway.

570
00:37:31.721 --> 00:37:34.660
That's an example of a company that grew by acquisition.

571
00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:37.770
It's an holding company that now have a,

572
00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:42.020
we could say a hundreds of the divisions.
So there's many way.
Yeah.

573
00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:43.150
Duana I mean,

574
00:37:43.610 --> 00:37:47.560
and Mcdonald's for many years at just a little bit like about one concept that

575
00:37:47.561 --> 00:37:50.650
they,
they need the calm many times.

576
00:37:50.651 --> 00:37:53.230
So I think that in the end,

577
00:37:53.231 --> 00:37:56.830
what really counts is over,
let's say a decade.

578
00:37:56.831 --> 00:37:58.390
It's the growth in earnings per share.

579
00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:04.080
So if you have a great business model,
if,
if,
uh,

580
00:38:04.090 --> 00:38:07.510
you have great seasoning management and he said,
great return on capital,

581
00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:12.460
it will translates into a earnings per share growth,
which,

582
00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:16.300
uh,
will translate it into a stock that will go up.

583
00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:21.360
So if you pay a reasonable price and the earnings per share quadruple over a

584
00:38:22.271 --> 00:38:25.120
decade,
there's a good chance that the stock will do the same

585
00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:29.440
<v 0>when you apply the earnings per share concept to a company like,
you know,</v>

586
00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:32.910
bookshare you mentioned,
but even mark health for example,
you know,

587
00:38:32.911 --> 00:38:37.600
an insurance company where you may not realize the earnings because you know,

588
00:38:37.601 --> 00:38:40.240
they're just piling up on the balance sheet.

589
00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:43.830
<v 2>Yeah.
Well in terms of for Berkshire Mark,</v>

590
00:38:43.831 --> 00:38:48.720
our probably a price to book is a better,
it's not perfect,

591
00:38:48.721 --> 00:38:52.620
but this is probably a better way to value.
And you use a ratio,

592
00:38:53.010 --> 00:38:54.450
I think,
uh,

593
00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:59.810
for both companies 1.5 1.6 times book value would make sense because that's the

594
00:39:01.501 --> 00:39:05.430
nature of their business.
That's a,
the yearnings are more erratic.

595
00:39:05.431 --> 00:39:08.430
So you have to value in some other way.

596
00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:11.670
So you have to adapt to the business model,
the business,

597
00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:13.980
<v 0>your friends who we had one of our guests,</v>

598
00:39:13.981 --> 00:39:16.920
they brought up a very interesting concept.
They said,
you know,

599
00:39:16.921 --> 00:39:20.250
you look at all these great companies and you recognize that,
you know,

600
00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:22.770
there is a mode and you know,

601
00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:27.210
the past 10 or 15 years they've displayed that in their numbers and then you sit

602
00:39:27.211 --> 00:39:29.760
back and ask yourself in the future,

603
00:39:29.761 --> 00:39:32.490
may not necessarily be identical to the past.

604
00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:36.540
So they said what really matters is,
you know,
they're the moat we growing.

605
00:39:36.690 --> 00:39:39.240
It doesn't matter whether it's site,
smaller,
big.

606
00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:43.620
So how do you think about growing or modes or margin,

607
00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:45.510
most versus established modes?

608
00:39:46.370 --> 00:39:51.120
<v 2>Uh,
that's very hard because I most always keep changing.
And,</v>

609
00:39:51.121 --> 00:39:53.700
uh,
I remember a few years back,
uh,

610
00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:58.230
Charlie Munger said that,
uh,
I had the,

611
00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:03.320
I ask a question to Charlie about molds and all those great companies that seems

612
00:40:04.441 --> 00:40:08.610
to see they're both shrinking.
And he said,
well,

613
00:40:08.611 --> 00:40:13.380
I know all those molds are getting filled with sand.
And so,

614
00:40:13.381 --> 00:40:16.050
um,
I asked him,

615
00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:20.340
which company do you think as an expanding mode?
And that was six years,

616
00:40:20.341 --> 00:40:22.950
seven years ago,
I said that Google interests,

617
00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:27.780
I think that's an incredibly covered,
incredible company.
And I remember thinking,

618
00:40:27.781 --> 00:40:31.740
well,
I knew about Google off of course,
but,
uh,
I said,
well,

619
00:40:31.741 --> 00:40:35.610
I should take a new look at it.
And,
uh,
we,

620
00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:40.170
we bought chairs in 2000 and live in after,
after that comment.
So,
uh,

621
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:43.680
we were lucky because at that time their p ratio was 15 times.

622
00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:46.590
So if it would have been a few points higher,

623
00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:51.600
probably would have a past and miss the increased 400% since then.

624
00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:56.760
So,
um,
there's always new companies with both,

625
00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:01.170
some are expanding,
some of our shrinking,
so we have to follow that closely.

626
00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:06.590
But they finally had to choose one criteria to help me decide what's the

627
00:41:07.921 --> 00:41:11.160
direction of the mold.
Because the managers,
I mean,

628
00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:15.600
those moles are not built by angels.
They're built by humans beings.

629
00:41:15.601 --> 00:41:18.990
So what makes a both grow,

630
00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:23.160
I think is something in the culture of the company.

631
00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:26.680
And they'll,
things doesn't come from thin air.

632
00:41:26.681 --> 00:41:31.500
It comes from the top management that builds that culture and then it translate

633
00:41:31.501 --> 00:41:36.320
them to a mope and then high return on equity for the shareholders.

634
00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:40.460
<v 0>So when you look at the high returns of equity over the last 10 years,</v>

635
00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:45.760
do you say it was because of the culture or are there other things beyond just

636
00:41:46.281 --> 00:41:50.480
the numbers that you try and study to identify whether this is a culture and you

637
00:41:50.481 --> 00:41:51.680
want to be associated with?

638
00:41:52.050 --> 00:41:56.580
<v 2>Well,
there's many things.
Uh,
it's really,
uh,
what's the nature of the products?</v>

639
00:41:56.630 --> 00:42:00.630
What's the nature?
You know,
the funny thing with Google,

640
00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:05.430
it was not the first company that,
uh,
had a search engine on the Internet,

641
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:09.660
the last one that come up with a new,
a search engine.

642
00:42:09.661 --> 00:42:13.230
But this one was better than the others.
Uh,
thinking,
uh,
yeah,

643
00:42:13.231 --> 00:42:17.520
well I'll tell [inaudible] or those first companies that,

644
00:42:17.521 --> 00:42:18.510
that search engine,

645
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:23.870
so sometimes the first arrival and sometimes strangely it's the last arrival.

646
00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:28.950
So,
uh,
that's the,
that's the,

647
00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:34.200
that's the tough thing with investing.
Every story is new and different.

648
00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:37.650
So you have to,
when I said it's important to have an open mind,

649
00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:43.040
it's because if you have this very strict frame to analyze companies,

650
00:42:43.351 --> 00:42:47.520
probably you miss lots of things because every situation is new and the future

651
00:42:47.521 --> 00:42:50.320
is all the oils,
uncharted territory.

652
00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:53.800
So you have to have some principles,
uh,

653
00:42:53.970 --> 00:42:55.980
you look for certain things,

654
00:42:56.250 --> 00:43:01.250
but in the end you have to judge every a situation differently and by they own

655
00:43:02.911 --> 00:43:06.330
pair of meters.
And if you look at our portfolio,

656
00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:10.080
we own something at 25 companies.
And I think the,

657
00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:15.740
the reason we invested in dose 25 differ very much from one to the other

658
00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:18.040
sometimes to really because of the management.

659
00:43:18.041 --> 00:43:22.630
And sometimes it's really because we think the brand is very solid and sometimes

660
00:43:22.631 --> 00:43:27.480
we think the company has lots of room to grow and it's just like a Starbucks

661
00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:32.510
where they just have to clone the concept that they built.

662
00:43:32.850 --> 00:43:37.830
So
there's no one recipe.

663
00:43:37.831 --> 00:43:42.000
It's really to have an adaptive mine and trying to understand the nature of the

664
00:43:42.001 --> 00:43:44.230
business you want to invest into it.
Okay.

665
00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:47.290
<v 0>So that leads into my next question actually,
which is,
you know,</v>

666
00:43:47.291 --> 00:43:48.580
when do you decide to sell?

667
00:43:48.970 --> 00:43:53.110
You said your average holding period is about seven years and you invest in

668
00:43:53.111 --> 00:43:56.410
quality companies and you know,
you give the example of Carmax,

669
00:43:56.411 --> 00:43:59.470
which you've been holding on for several years.
Um,

670
00:44:00.010 --> 00:44:03.460
but it's all the company like Intel,
if I remember correctly.
Yeah.

671
00:44:03.610 --> 00:44:04.870
So can you talk about,
you know,

672
00:44:04.871 --> 00:44:09.190
how you think about selling companies because you think of yourself as a
partner.

673
00:44:09.191 --> 00:44:13.830
So it must be an emotional process as well maybe.
But yeah,
we tried to remove it,

674
00:44:13.830 --> 00:44:14.300
high emotion

675
00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:17.120
<v 2>from the process,
but it's never easy because we're,</v>

676
00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:21.140
we're human beings so or emotional.
So we have to accept that.

677
00:44:21.141 --> 00:44:25.250
Then sometimes accepting it and going beyond said,
well,

678
00:44:25.251 --> 00:44:28.550
that's why we have those uh,

679
00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:33.090
rules or process that helps them make decision.
And this really for reason,

680
00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:37.860
we'll sell stock.
The first one they realize we made a mistake that's happened.

681
00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:40.930
And I don't know the ratio.
It's probably one,

682
00:44:40.931 --> 00:44:43.680
I'll have three or four stars that we buy.

683
00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:47.580
For some reason we've made a mistake.
And,
um,

684
00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:51.180
the thing to do is just sell except that that's part of the process and you're a

685
00:44:51.181 --> 00:44:55.200
human being and it's a tough world outside,
uh,
and so tough world.

686
00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:58.470
And uh,
so when you made a mistake,
just tell them,

687
00:44:58.471 --> 00:45:01.110
go into some other investment.

688
00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:05.250
The second reason it's a little different is that he didn't really made a

689
00:45:05.251 --> 00:45:10.080
mistake,
but the nature of the business has changed.
There's a new competitor,

690
00:45:10.081 --> 00:45:14.310
there's a new economic environment,
there's new technology,

691
00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:18.120
whatever,
as change in the industry or the company itself.

692
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:20.760
It's not as great as when you first purchased it.

693
00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:23.430
So when you realize that you have to sell,

694
00:45:23.550 --> 00:45:26.970
and it can be a year after you bought it,
or 10 years after he bought it.

695
00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:32.660
And the third one is probably when I look at this situation then I don't agree

696
00:45:34.081 --> 00:45:38.070
with a management decision use Uli.
It's a big acquisition.

697
00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:43.290
And when I feel that I don't agree with management,
I just sell.
Okay.

698
00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:44.580
I mean,
uh,

699
00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:49.970
I have this saying that if I am to read you in one sentence what investing is,

700
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:53.790
it should be gum.
You become partner with the top management.

701
00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:58.440
If you don't trust them anymore,
there's no reason to be partners.
So we sell.

702
00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:01.530
And the fourth reason,
which is probably the most common one,

703
00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:05.490
we just found it an investment that we think has better prospects.

704
00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:10.080
And so we sell a two by be,
not necessarily because there's a problem with a,

705
00:46:10.081 --> 00:46:13.530
but just that we think that we will be more rewarding.

706
00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:17.050
<v 0>Okay.
And finally,
before we let it out to the audience,</v>

707
00:46:17.051 --> 00:46:20.320
I wanted to talk about my favorite part of your,
I know letters,

708
00:46:20.650 --> 00:46:25.210
which is those metals.
Uh,
and correct me if my memory is failing me,

709
00:46:25.211 --> 00:46:26.980
but was Valliant one of the metals?

710
00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:30.300
<v 2>Uh,
yeah.
Yeah.
It was a,
yeah,
it was a mistake.
Yeah.</v>

711
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:33.330
We were lucky because we didn't make money with that,
that an investment,

712
00:46:33.331 --> 00:46:34.830
but they turn out to be a mistake.

713
00:46:34.990 --> 00:46:37.840
<v 0>Yeah.
So can you talk to the audience,</v>

714
00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:42.520
explain the medals a little bit more and tell us how you give a metal even to

715
00:46:42.521 --> 00:46:45.100
something you call a mistake and still make money out of it?

716
00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:49.290
<v 2>Well,
I would say there's,
there's a different between being a,</v>

717
00:46:49.291 --> 00:46:54.200
a good and lucky.
So we were lucky there.
So that was still a mistake.

718
00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:56.120
Uh,
basically,
um,

719
00:46:57.200 --> 00:47:02.200
well we make many mistakes and we only choose three to give medals to a bronze,

720
00:47:03.351 --> 00:47:05.510
silver and gold.
And,
uh,

721
00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:09.240
most of the time the mistakes are missions start.

722
00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:13.710
Starbucks as an example is a company that fits all I care,
Tierra.

723
00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:18.720
And we decided not to buy for some sometimes simplistic reason and a,

724
00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:21.720
you,
uh,
you know,

725
00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:26.090
10000% gain over 25 years for that reason.
So,

726
00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:27.380
uh,

727
00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:32.380
we tried to give medals to most costly mistakes and the most costly are usually,

728
00:47:33.110 --> 00:47:34.150
usually missions.

729
00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:39.250
Sometimes it's like value that there was this talk that we did purchase and a,

730
00:47:39.310 --> 00:47:44.260
we made a mistake.
Um,
while in the case of valiant,
I think,
uh,

731
00:47:44.290 --> 00:47:47.200
we have a lot of confidence in the management and uh,

732
00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:52.510
also at the same time that much more debt than we're usually a willing to live

733
00:47:52.511 --> 00:47:55.120
with.
And uh,
we,

734
00:47:55.210 --> 00:47:59.470
we did the kind of an exception to our rules and it turned out that it was a

735
00:47:59.471 --> 00:48:01.540
mistake.
So

736
00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:05.390
<v 0>what you got out Liam,
before,
you know,
a lot of the other,</v>

737
00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:10.460
<v 2>yeah,
but the selection wasn't mistake,
so it turned out,</v>

738
00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:15.350
you know,
in the end financially it was okay,
but uh,
that's not,

739
00:48:15.351 --> 00:48:19.220
that's still a mistake.
And that's the hard part.
When you look at your mistakes,

740
00:48:19.221 --> 00:48:23.750
you want to be very objective and say,
well,
this is a mistake for those reasons,

741
00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:28.730
but some stocks that I didn't purchase that went up a hundred times,

742
00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:32.420
but I really didn't understand.
That's not really a mistake.

743
00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:36.740
It's just that you decided that this was outside of your circle of competence

744
00:48:36.741 --> 00:48:40.190
and you missed it.
But that's not really a mistake.
It's a mistake.

745
00:48:40.191 --> 00:48:43.940
When it was in your circle of competence and for some reason you didn't go

746
00:48:43.941 --> 00:48:48.941
through the purchase or it's a mistake when you thought that the company was and

747
00:48:49.161 --> 00:48:51.320
your circle of competence and a and it was not.

748
00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:55.420
So that's basically the two reasons I made a mistake.

749
00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:59.040
We'll be in the chapter of the [inaudible] leather.

750
00:48:59.370 --> 00:49:02.010
<v 0>It's interesting you separate luck in outcome,</v>

751
00:49:02.370 --> 00:49:07.260
which is what a one of our previous speakers,
Michael Mobile seen talks about,

752
00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:12.120
you know,
skill and luck.
And then Howard marks also say is that,
you know,
he,

753
00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:13.440
when he was here and he said,
you know,

754
00:49:13.441 --> 00:49:16.890
what will happen might be different from what should happen.

755
00:49:16.891 --> 00:49:21.480
So you need to decouple them in your thinking.
But thank you very much.
With that,

756
00:49:21.481 --> 00:49:24.360
let me open it up to the audience if we have any questions for you.

757
00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:29.300
<v 2>Okay.
Okay.
Any questions?
What financial?
Yeah.</v>

758
00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:34.150
Hi Fans.
Thank you for the excellent doc.
Thank you.

759
00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:38.040
There's been eating your letters over the years and it's really excellent.
Uh,

760
00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:40.690
one of the questions I wanted to ask you was,
uh,
uh,

761
00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:44.260
you were showing us this chart about Walt Disney and buying it at 24 names

762
00:49:44.261 --> 00:49:48.770
earnings,
right?
How do you pay up for good businesses?
Because the,

763
00:49:48.850 --> 00:49:52.120
the times when these businesses are available,
uh,
you know,

764
00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:55.420
with this margin of safety is maybe when something is wrong,

765
00:49:55.421 --> 00:50:00.030
maybe when the market rightly or wrongly thinks that something's off.
Uh,

766
00:50:00.370 --> 00:50:02.950
and if that's not the case,
then how do you pay up?
But if that's the case,

767
00:50:02.951 --> 00:50:07.680
how do you separate what the market is thinking was his reality?
Um,

768
00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:10.240
we tried to focus on the very long term.

769
00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:15.750
So we try to look five years in the future and we come up,

770
00:50:16.890 --> 00:50:18.990
you know,
uh,
with our best judgment,

771
00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:23.410
what we believe the earnings per share should be in five years low.

772
00:50:23.410 --> 00:50:27.920
So let's say Disney,
uh,
we,
when we bought in two five,

773
00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:32.150
we said,
well,
we think this company can earn $3 a share in five years.

774
00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:34.220
And then,
you know,

775
00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:39.760
if you think that the fundamentals will still be good pass those five years,

776
00:50:40.011 --> 00:50:41.360
we'll say,
well it's,

777
00:50:41.410 --> 00:50:45.710
it probably will warrant that p ratio of let's say 20 times.

778
00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:49.130
So that gives you a $60 thousand in five years.

779
00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:54.460
So if you can buy the stock at $30 or less today and you were right on the $60

780
00:50:55.761 --> 00:50:59.960
in five years,
you should be rewarded the,
um,
you know,

781
00:50:59.961 --> 00:51:01.940
earning something 15% annually.

782
00:51:02.930 --> 00:51:07.930
The earning that the company has today is not really relevant to that.

783
00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:12.680
So if they aren't,
the ones are,
uh,
this year,
uh,

784
00:51:12.681 --> 00:51:14.630
it looks so pricey at 30 times,

785
00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:18.910
but if you have a longterm horizon and you're focusing on where to sock,

786
00:51:18.911 --> 00:51:23.210
you'll be a,
or the yearnings will be in five years.
Uh,

787
00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:27.200
in the end you'll be okay.
So having this long term are rising,

788
00:51:27.201 --> 00:51:32.180
I believe helps you to defocus the p ratio of today.

789
00:51:32.450 --> 00:51:35.660
And it goes the other way.
If you find a cheap stock,

790
00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:41.200
but you look five years in the future and you don't see any girls prospects,

791
00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:45.350
there's no real reason to believe that the stock will be higher in five years.

792
00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:49.310
It can be a higher end months just because a p has gone from 10 to 12 times.
But,

793
00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:51.710
uh,
we don't try to invest,
which we amounts.

794
00:51:51.711 --> 00:51:54.020
We try and that's what we're faced five years.

795
00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:55.673
<v 1>Thank you.</v>

796
00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:03.770
<v 2>Thank you very much for the great talk and welcome to Google.
So,
uh,</v>

797
00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:08.160
I have a question,
uh,
considering now the current market conditions,

798
00:52:08.190 --> 00:52:13.190
there's a lot of them warning by people about the risk and there's a lot of fund

799
00:52:13.770 --> 00:52:18.270
managers returning and found to the investors.
So I wonder like,

800
00:52:18.271 --> 00:52:22.460
what do you think about it,
the market in general and a,

801
00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:27.210
what's the race Kenta expect return for them maybe next five,
10 years.
Thank you.

802
00:52:27.730 --> 00:52:28.950
Yeah.
Well,
uh,

803
00:52:30.010 --> 00:52:35.010
of course it's not as exciting for an investor today as it was that same 2009

804
00:52:35.471 --> 00:52:40.120
when starts were really,
really cheap.
But you know,
it was Carrie then too.
So,

805
00:52:40.510 --> 00:52:41.343
um,

806
00:52:41.770 --> 00:52:46.770
I always try to kind of the focus what's happening to the market and more focus

807
00:52:47.530 --> 00:52:50.440
on the companies that we own the portfolio.

808
00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:53.950
And when we look at our portfolio and,
uh,

809
00:52:54.310 --> 00:52:58.750
we've got this group of 25 companies that were pretty confident that they'll

810
00:52:58.751 --> 00:53:03.751
grow their earnings by at least 10 to 12% in the next five years under p ratio

811
00:53:04.210 --> 00:53:09.110
seems reasonable.
There's no reason I think,
to,
to be worried.
Uh,

812
00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:14.020
I don't know what the market will do in the next six months,
a year or two.
Uh,

813
00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:17.110
but I think the companies we own in the next five years,
we'll do okay.

814
00:53:18.100 --> 00:53:22.330
And if you look at the general stock market,
we don't have views in general,

815
00:53:22.331 --> 00:53:26.610
but we think that companies can continue to grow their earnings per share,

816
00:53:27.150 --> 00:53:30.360
let's say five to 7% that unruly the next five years,

817
00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:33.120
and you add a dividend to have 2%.

818
00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:37.830
So even though there's no p changes over the next five years,

819
00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:43.190
while that's what translate into a total return for stars for seven to 9%,

820
00:53:43.830 --> 00:53:48.240
so it's not as exciting as eight years ago.
But,
uh,

821
00:53:48.420 --> 00:53:53.130
still it's pretty decent returns when and compare that to bonds with probably he

822
00:53:53.170 --> 00:53:55.740
or something and I less than 2% over the next five years.

823
00:53:56.670 --> 00:54:01.670
So it's not extraordinary exciting to find opportunities,

824
00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:07.160
but I think the returns will be decent mostly for the stocks we own and probably

825
00:54:07.231 --> 00:54:08.280
a stock market as well.

826
00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:12.600
We have one question were there and

827
00:54:14.410 --> 00:54:17.970
see thanks for the talk.
I think a couple of questions.

828
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.580
The first one is I was just looking,
I don't know if it's accurate or not,

829
00:54:20.581 --> 00:54:24.540
I was just looking at the your holdings and I noticed you have like mastercard

830
00:54:24.541 --> 00:54:28.230
yet visa,
mastercard,
you have like I think deposition of 200,

831
00:54:28.231 --> 00:54:32.070
10,000 whereas visa you have like a position at 35 million.

832
00:54:32.250 --> 00:54:36.210
I'm just wondering why you bother keeping mastercard with such a low number

833
00:54:36.211 --> 00:54:38.850
rather than it goes,
he won't even meet,
move the needle.
Right.

834
00:54:38.851 --> 00:54:41.940
Why don't I just put it all into visa because they sit seem to attract each

835
00:54:41.941 --> 00:54:46.800
other anyways,
so that,
that's the first question.
Yeah,
that's a very easy,
uh,

836
00:54:46.860 --> 00:54:51.690
we prefer visa obviously,
and a mastercard.
We all fuel share.
Just to follow it.

837
00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:54.330
But we both think,
we think both companies are great.

838
00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:56.920
These are fantastic businesses.
Uh,

839
00:54:56.940 --> 00:55:01.940
we prefer visa and mastercard just to follow a company we have a few shares is

840
00:55:02.701 --> 00:55:07.701
up because of Visa Europe or just in general think a visa is an extraordinary

841
00:55:09.121 --> 00:55:10.810
business.
And uh,

842
00:55:12.210 --> 00:55:16.350
I think it's hard to say because mastercard is a great business too.

843
00:55:16.351 --> 00:55:18.660
But I think visa as a little something more.

844
00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:25.020
And the second question was in terms of like the big tech stocks,
right?
I mean,

845
00:55:25.110 --> 00:55:29.880
uh,
I noticed you have Google,
so thank you.
But just curious.
Oh Wow.

846
00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:34.500
Thank you.
I I reviewed,
make you give your thoughts on apple.

847
00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:37.680
Why you don't own it?
Because it's got,
I mean,
personally I own,

848
00:55:38.070 --> 00:55:41.850
I own a position there because I think it's got a low valuation and it's got a

849
00:55:42.090 --> 00:55:45.840
very good motor rounded,
especially,
uh,
with all the services added to it.

850
00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:50.800
So just curious on your thoughts on that.
Yeah.
Well obviously apple could be a,

851
00:55:51.150 --> 00:55:54.390
in the section of mistakes because I mean it's sub what,

852
00:55:54.391 --> 00:55:56.850
50 times in the last decade or something like that.

853
00:55:57.180 --> 00:56:00.120
So it's been a great investments.
It's a great company.

854
00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:01.610
I mean I can't argue with that.

855
00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:06.570
And the evaluation does look very low and I think they do have a mold.

856
00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:11.630
And probably five years ago I wasn't that convinced that the mold was that large

857
00:56:13.291 --> 00:56:16.890
and it turned out that it is a very solid business.

858
00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:21.210
Uh,
and I think,
I don't know exactly the number,

859
00:56:21.211 --> 00:56:26.211
but I think today 10% of their revenues are service base and a recurring and as

860
00:56:27.161 --> 00:56:30.880
it get a larger part of the revenue was,
I think that both,
we'll,

861
00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:33.310
we'll be expanding still.

862
00:56:33.370 --> 00:56:38.290
A large part of their revenue was at an earnings come from selling new products.

863
00:56:38.590 --> 00:56:43.240
And when you asked to sell something new every two or three years,

864
00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:45.670
this is a risk that you'll,
you'll miss a,

865
00:56:46.330 --> 00:56:51.330
a product launch or something will not exactly satisfied a customer for whatever

866
00:56:51.491 --> 00:56:56.170
reason or you just have to risk also having another company that comes up with a

867
00:56:56.171 --> 00:57:00.430
new and improved product.
So I think if you compare apple and Google,

868
00:57:00.431 --> 00:57:05.431
I think Google business is more stable and more entrenched and a more recurring

869
00:57:07.661 --> 00:57:10.360
and the thing demote is larger in Google and apple.

870
00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:12.940
That doesn't mean that is not a great business.

871
00:57:12.941 --> 00:57:16.290
And you have to ask yourself a at that prize,

872
00:57:16.291 --> 00:57:18.940
a p ratio differences.
So high,

873
00:57:19.450 --> 00:57:24.450
I think apple trades at 15 times and Google is probably 25 times or if he's not

874
00:57:25.841 --> 00:57:30.120
as close to 30.
So,
um,

875
00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:32.980
while I remember many years ago the pressure,
uh,

876
00:57:33.350 --> 00:57:37.150
and his book that a common stocks and nonconforming profits,

877
00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:41.080
the further in the future you can see growth there.

878
00:57:41.081 --> 00:57:45.560
Hired a p ratio you can pay.
So in the term in terms of visa thing,

879
00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:50.670
you can see the company having their most protective for many,

880
00:57:51.521 --> 00:57:55.180
many years.
It's hard to figure out who could the hurt them.

881
00:57:55.810 --> 00:57:58.540
And a,
you can see many,
many years of growth.

882
00:57:58.870 --> 00:58:03.100
So I think that warrants high PE ratio.
But of course,

883
00:58:03.740 --> 00:58:08.510
uh,
it was better in 2010 when we bought it.
The thing we paid,
I don't know,

884
00:58:08.660 --> 00:58:13.590
15 times or so.
Obviously we had a much larger margin of safety than,

885
00:58:13.610 --> 00:58:14.470
than we have today.

886
00:58:15.790 --> 00:58:18.890
<v 0>I've got one.
I don't know if that answers your question.
It does.
Yeah.
Go ahead.</v>

887
00:58:19.130 --> 00:58:24.130
Maybe cause I noticed one of your largest holdings is Berkshire Hathaway as

888
00:58:24.171 --> 00:58:26.570
well.
And they've taken a big position in apple.

889
00:58:27.140 --> 00:58:30.360
So indirectly you actually probably own more shares of apple through your

890
00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:33.410
holdings.
A Burger,
you have the Internet App.
I don't know if you look into that,

891
00:58:33.650 --> 00:58:34.590
that,
you know,

892
00:58:34.610 --> 00:58:38.060
I own this company and it already gives me exposure so I won't own it
separately.

893
00:58:38.180 --> 00:58:41.540
Do you think?
Well that's not really a reason.

894
00:58:41.890 --> 00:58:44.990
<v 2>The,
um,
of course when we own Berkshire,</v>

895
00:58:44.991 --> 00:58:47.870
we own apoe and we all Coca Cola and uh,

896
00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:53.320
we own Geico and some Burlington northern Santa Fe and precision Castparts so,

897
00:58:53.750 --> 00:58:58.520
and we get,
and precision Castparts wasn't a portfolio a few years back,

898
00:58:58.521 --> 00:59:02.900
so we're still shareholders.
So,
uh,
but you know,

899
00:59:02.901 --> 00:59:07.580
if we thought that the apple was a good purchase for us today,
uh,

900
00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:10.940
owning Berkshire wouldn't be a reason enough to,
to do it.

901
00:59:11.290 --> 00:59:14.870
<v 0>Two friends who when you look at something like,
you know,
visa are apo,</v>

902
00:59:15.050 --> 00:59:17.330
you would go to portfolio,
has low debt companies,

903
00:59:17.331 --> 00:59:22.190
sometimes they might even have excess cash.
So when you look the PE ratio,

904
00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:24.340
you take the cash out.
How do you

905
00:59:25.030 --> 00:59:29.860
<v 2>I think so because I mean that's cash that could be returned to investors.</v>

906
00:59:31.010 --> 00:59:36.010
It's a little harder for apple or Google because a lot of those caches in the

907
00:59:36.211 --> 00:59:40.690
other countries sometimes a little complicated to get back in the u s that cash

908
00:59:40.691 --> 00:59:43.960
and give it to shareholders.
But in the end,

909
00:59:43.961 --> 00:59:48.400
in some ways or the other at this,
this cash will be returned to shareholders.

910
00:59:48.401 --> 00:59:52.180
I hope.
And uh,
I should be taking out of the,
by the way,

911
00:59:52.181 --> 00:59:54.630
but what you want to do is really do this,

912
00:59:54.631 --> 00:59:59.631
some of what you expect the cash to be generated by the company in the future

913
01:00:00.251 --> 01:00:02.140
discounted to today.

914
01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:06.790
And then you add the cash that is today so you get a proper evaluation.
Right.

915
01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:09.540
<v 0>Well,
it makes sense.
Would that,
uh,
French,
well,</v>

916
01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:11.980
thank you so much for being with us here today.

917
01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:15.820
I really enjoyed your presentation and your dog and thank you all for being such

918
01:00:15.821 --> 01:00:16.654
a great audience.

919
01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:21.150
