1
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.300
Very excited to have Karen here.
Karen has a long storied history at Google.

2
00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.510
She joined Google in 2002 and was here through 2011 and worked as a media

3
00:00:15.851 --> 00:00:16.684
liaison.

4
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.390
I really watched a lot of the things that you've taken for granted here at

5
00:00:19.391 --> 00:00:21.430
Google,
including the blog,
uh,

6
00:00:21.431 --> 00:00:24.630
and our Twitter account and much of our outbound has flown through her income

7
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:25.600
from her ideas.

8
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.890
She later went on to be an editorial director at Twitter and was there I think

9
00:00:29.891 --> 00:00:32.830
six years,
about five,
about five,
we'll give her five.

10
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.920
And so she's had really kind of a,

11
00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:39.910
a firsthand experience at some of the biggest names in tech and really the
world.

12
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.410
And you've had a front row seat to that.

13
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.310
And it's been interesting to see your career flourish and grow even after you

14
00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:46.600
left this small little company.

15
00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.930
And it was good to see your stories when you wrote this book,

16
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.970
which is taking the work out of networking,

17
00:00:51.971 --> 00:00:55.440
which is really an introvert's guide to networking.
Uh,

18
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.570
one thing that's been fun for me to see is that I feel like everybody knows

19
00:00:58.571 --> 00:01:03.340
Karen or they've known of her or she has been one step away from other people

20
00:01:03.341 --> 00:01:07.150
that we know.
I managed to go through this book and really take a lot out of it.

21
00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.170
And so I'm glad you're here to talk about it.
And me too.

22
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.000
We probably have a few introverts in the room who could benefit from it.

23
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.740
So first why don't you tell us,
why did you write a book for introverts?

24
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.190
<v 0>Uh,
well,
uh,
I'm thrilled to be here.</v>

25
00:01:21.191 --> 00:01:26.191
I love Google and if long left Google so it's great to be back in the plex,

26
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.350
uh,
as it were.
Um,

27
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.950
I wrote the book to see if I could break down in detail the things I have done

28
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.940
to create a sort of big virtual network for myself.

29
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.140
And it wasn't that I woke up one day and said,
wow,
I have a fantastic network.

30
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.040
It's more than other people over the years have often said to me,

31
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.150
you seem to know everybody.
And,
uh,

32
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.550
I would be the one for the hot years.
And Google,
as he said,

33
00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.200
as Lewis said,
it was here from 2002 when hiring really turned up and,

34
00:02:02.201 --> 00:02:06.490
and Google was getting a million resumes a year,
it might still,
I don't know.

35
00:02:06.491 --> 00:02:11.491
But there was a point where that started to happen and I was getting inundated

36
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.000
from all my other contacts everywhere I want to work at Google,

37
00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:17.020
I want to work at Google.

38
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.560
And I generally will say yes to most meetings or calls or hangouts or something.

39
00:02:22.721 --> 00:02:27.190
I would,
I would connect with everybody that wanted head questions.

40
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.610
The answers would vary obviously,
depending on a lot of things.

41
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.430
But during that time I,

42
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.240
as I was sort of telling people maybe how to go about navigating Google and

43
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.240
applying to Google and thinking about it,
it sort of led me to think how,

44
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.850
how can I caught a Fi,
uh,

45
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.020
how people not just do a job search but also,
you know,

46
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.360
extent like be able to call on other people,
uh,
when they have questions,

47
00:02:55.361 --> 00:02:58.390
when they need something because we all have those moments.

48
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.810
So fast forward a few years and I wrote a column for what used to be called back

49
00:03:05.081 --> 00:03:09.670
channel,
which is now part of wired.
Steven Levy,
uh,
was the editor.

50
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.370
Um,
and it was essentially building,

51
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.570
building off of my many meetings with uh,

52
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.130
either job seekers or people that wanted to move into tech businesses from some

53
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:24.790
more traditional industry or something like that.
And I,

54
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.490
I kind of went through the same thing and I thought,
you know,

55
00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:31.930
I need to really kind of detailed this.
So fast forward again,

56
00:03:31.931 --> 00:03:34.480
I've left Twitter,
uh,
got uh,
uh,

57
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.370
a book agent and a couple of New York editors called me and we kicked around a

58
00:03:39.371 --> 00:03:42.970
bunch of ideas for books.
And finally someone asked me,

59
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.530
what is the one piece of advice that you find yourself always giving people?

60
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.350
And I said,
it is to build a network for life.

61
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.940
Introvert didn't really come into it except I'm an introvert,
so I'm not,

62
00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.060
I've never not built a network on the basis of me being a famous celebrity.

63
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.540
I've,
I much more prefer not only my,
not that,

64
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.800
but I much more prefer a kind of a background role and I still have done it.

65
00:04:11.321 --> 00:04:15.310
And so that's what made me think,
okay,
let me kind of break this out for people.

66
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.010
Uh,
so the book is for introverts,

67
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.550
but not only introverts because in the process of doing it,

68
00:04:21.551 --> 00:04:25.210
I discovered everybody hates networking.
Everybody hates the idea.

69
00:04:25.211 --> 00:04:30.010
Everybody thinks of it as a chore and that it's Phony and uh,
you know,

70
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.520
it,
it doesn't seem to yield much very effectively.

71
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.470
So I thought this is,
this is the way I want to go with,
make something,
uh,

72
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.430
you know,
approach in a way that's more useful for all kinds of people.

73
00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.970
<v 2>You talked about networking being a chore.
I think most people use it.</v>

74
00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.480
They don't like it,
they don't want to do it.

75
00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.900
That's especially true for introverts.
Many times when you talk about networking,

76
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.590
you're talking about it from the phase of a job seeker.
Yes.

77
00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.640
And yet there are people who have stable jobs who don't plan on leaving.

78
00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.500
So who cares?
You know?

79
00:05:00.501 --> 00:05:05.000
So why was somebody who's in a stable job want to do networking and why is it

80
00:05:05.001 --> 00:05:05.834
important for them?

81
00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.590
<v 0>Thanks.
You have a stable job for the rest of your working life.</v>

82
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.970
I mean,
honestly,
I,

83
00:05:14.971 --> 00:05:19.860
I've talked to people who did think that until their job wasn't stable,
right?
Uh,

84
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.870
until you name any kind of change happened that they weren't happy with or you

85
00:05:26.521 --> 00:05:30.530
know,
there are lots of circumstances happen.
And so the idea that you,

86
00:05:30.531 --> 00:05:33.060
it's a kind of one and done thing.
Uh,

87
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.300
it just isn't reality for most of us anymore.

88
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:41.630
But I also think the value of once kind of personal connections and contacts or

89
00:05:41.731 --> 00:05:45.600
as I the subtitle making connections that count,
uh,

90
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:51.080
is it really something we do want to be able to call on people who have subject

91
00:05:51.931 --> 00:05:56.220
matter expertise and experience in this specific thing when we're looking for

92
00:05:56.221 --> 00:05:59.720
that specific thing.
So job's a big category,
but not only,

93
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.930
but I have literally talked to people who have said,

94
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.670
I'm coming to you because I let my network go.
How do I start again?

95
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:12.080
Because I've been in a job I'd been happy in for a long time and now I need to

96
00:06:12.081 --> 00:06:12.914
make a change.

97
00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.430
<v 2>So one thing I've run into,
and you talked about it in the book,</v>

98
00:06:15.431 --> 00:06:19.840
was that there's this perception that networking or the process of it requires

99
00:06:19.841 --> 00:06:24.490
you to not be yourself and be fake to put an artificial representation of

100
00:06:24.491 --> 00:06:27.210
yourself and filter out the things you don't think people want to know.
Yeah.

101
00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:31.420
Do you find that that's true or do you find by being your true self in full,

102
00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.360
you have the most access to New People and new ideas?

103
00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:39.920
<v 0>I think when you're authentic and you're not in the clutch of kind of fear it</v>

104
00:06:40.021 --> 00:06:42.960
neediness and you know,

105
00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:46.440
feeling the need to be in a transactional mode with someone you don't know at

106
00:06:46.441 --> 00:06:50.160
all,
uh,
that's a,
that's a position of vulnerability to be sure.

107
00:06:50.161 --> 00:06:53.930
That's not fun for the person who's in it.
But you know,

108
00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.650
the more you find a common points of connection,

109
00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.760
even with people you don't know,
uh,

110
00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:05.710
the easier it will be to remember later.
Oh,
you know,

111
00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:08.520
I like that person was easy to talk to or I like that person.

112
00:07:08.521 --> 00:07:10.110
Maybe they're going to know about this.
All right.

113
00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:13.470
I know they do know about this other thing.
I'm asking a different role.

114
00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.370
A different company.
They lived in another country.
I'm thinking of,
you know,

115
00:07:17.371 --> 00:07:18.090
whatever it is,

116
00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:23.090
I that person is approachable and I think that's the way that we all want to

117
00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:28.590
connect with each other.
And so you know,
why not sort of put it to practice.

118
00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:30.750
You know as,
as we go along

119
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:35.690
<v 2>in 2000 as a.com bubble was popping and you start to,</v>

120
00:07:35.691 --> 00:07:38.630
if you look at your linkedin and they start to be instead of five year chunks,

121
00:07:38.631 --> 00:07:41.930
they're like one year chunks.
Right.
And I think a lot of people in the valley,

122
00:07:41.931 --> 00:07:45.230
especially,
you talk about it,
but we have three year job cycles.

123
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:50.180
So you came to the end of one of these one year job cycles and it was really

124
00:07:50.181 --> 00:07:53.150
hard to find a dedicated role and it was for a lot of your peers.

125
00:07:53.151 --> 00:07:58.151
And you talk about this story of you creating almost like a support group where

126
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.510
you connect with each other and say,
so how's it going?
And as you told it,

127
00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:07.370
that eventually led you to a contract role at Google a couple of years later.

128
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:09.980
So why was this your job?

129
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:13.100
How did it fall to you to put together this group?

130
00:08:13.101 --> 00:08:18.101
Because that shows to me someone who isn't necessarily that introvert stay at

131
00:08:18.321 --> 00:08:22.010
home role but more of a leader.
How did you get this?

132
00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:26.780
<v 0>Well,
I don't think those are opposite things.
Um,
so I am an introvert,</v>

133
00:08:26.781 --> 00:08:28.460
stay at home when it comes to,

134
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:33.320
if I've had kind of a long stretch of being out and about.
I,

135
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:36.350
the mental calculation is how soon can I go home,
right?

136
00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:39.530
Or like when can I get some respite from being out in the world?

137
00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:43.280
But I go back out into the world.
So,
uh,
the,
the,

138
00:08:43.281 --> 00:08:46.880
the thing I really am at root is a connector of people.

139
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.370
And I also thought it was true.

140
00:08:49.371 --> 00:08:52.760
There was this big downturn in 2000 2001,

141
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:56.820
nobody was hiring jobs just melted away.
I mean it was,

142
00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:02.630
it was at first for the bay area for Silicon Valley and uh,

143
00:09:03.421 --> 00:09:08.421
so I knew a bunch of people who had been looking and now there was really no,

144
00:09:08.641 --> 00:09:13.320
there were no jobs listed anymore.
So I,
I thought,
well,

145
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:16.170
we need to kind of keep each other going.
So I,

146
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:20.930
I asked a few people I knew at some better than others.
Um,

147
00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:24.990
some form of work colleagues,
I think there were eight of us or so,

148
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.470
and we would meet around my dining room table in the city.

149
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:33.360
I think we met weekly,
but it might've been less frequent.
But the idea was,

150
00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:36.000
you know,
talk over,
you know,

151
00:09:36.001 --> 00:09:40.260
what leads you're finding if you need help describing yourself or if you want to

152
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:43.860
be for the time being a consultant,
what are your services,
what's your pricing?

153
00:09:43.861 --> 00:09:48.780
Let's just kick it around because we got to kind of feel our way through this.

154
00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:54.000
And that group did meet for probably the better part of two years on and off,

155
00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:57.560
just because it was a long period of people,
you know,

156
00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:00.900
practicing their elevator pitch or maybe I'm going to be interested in this and

157
00:10:00.901 --> 00:10:04.020
I got to go do some research about that.
It was,
it was,
uh,

158
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:07.050
it was a good lesson for me.
And I think I,
it's,

159
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.460
I do turn to other people for advice and for guidance,

160
00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:13.860
and I want those people to be,
not random,

161
00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:18.840
but people who know,
know the environment I'm in and what I'm interested in.

162
00:10:18.841 --> 00:10:23.460
And that,
that was kind of the purpose of this group too.
So,
uh,

163
00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:27.780
it,
I did go,
I did move from my support group,

164
00:10:27.781 --> 00:10:32.781
but then at the dining room table to a contract as a marketing writer for Google

165
00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:35.970
in 2002.
However,

166
00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:40.710
I knew the first VP of comms here whose name was Cindy Mccaffrey,

167
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:44.370
because I'd worked with her at two other companies prior.

168
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:49.560
So I had kept up with her.
I'd visited Google,
not on university,
but in the,

169
00:10:49.561 --> 00:10:54.540
in the first of the office park complex is just over here.
And,

170
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:58.080
um,
you know,
I,
the other thing,

171
00:10:58.081 --> 00:11:02.160
I had been doing this freelance writing for trade publications.

172
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:04.770
So I actually got,

173
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:09.740
I reviewed Google as a search engine and I dunno,
something like,

174
00:11:09.741 --> 00:11:14.280
uh,
maybe 2000 just as a freelance thing.

175
00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:19.710
And I remember that's how I knew Google is that I've looked at it and it was so

176
00:11:19.711 --> 00:11:21.870
many leagues better than all the other,
you know,

177
00:11:21.871 --> 00:11:26.060
20 search engines that had come before.
Uh,
so I thought,
wow,
they've,

178
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:29.670
they've got something to sing,
really works.
I gave it a good review anyway,

179
00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:33.720
you know,
I came to have lunch with Cindy one day and uh,
I thought,
wow,
that's,

180
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:37.080
you know,
it's interesting and I just kept in touch with her.

181
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:41.580
I did call her when I was on the lookout for freelance work and initially she

182
00:11:41.581 --> 00:11:45.960
said,
we just hired a marketing writer.
So right now we're fine,

183
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:50.430
but I'll keep you in mind.
And then she called me back and said,
actually,

184
00:11:50.431 --> 00:11:54.670
we're drowning in work.
And that guy had to go on a leave.

185
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:56.140
How soon can you come down?

186
00:11:56.830 --> 00:12:00.190
And so it was September 3rd,
2002.

187
00:12:00.191 --> 00:12:04.390
While I do not forget this date.
Um,
and I had to,

188
00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:07.660
it wasn't just a matter of Cindy than I had to meet other people on the team and

189
00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:10.210
start talking about specific projects I'd be doing.

190
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:14.950
And within a couple of weeks I thought this is where I want to be.

191
00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:19.270
And rather than work at home and send things in,
I,
I said I'm going to be,

192
00:12:19.271 --> 00:12:23.650
I'm just going to be here and make them get sick of me.
I mean,
I'm just going to,

193
00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:27.670
I'm going to be here and remind them that I want a job here.
And it took a while,

194
00:12:27.671 --> 00:12:28.870
but that was how it happened.

195
00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:29.351
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

196
00:12:29.351 --> 00:12:33.100
And you mentioned earlier you made a comment about Google getting a million job

197
00:12:33.101 --> 00:12:35.140
applicants and day trying to get it.
Yeah.

198
00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:39.250
So that sounds like the world's changed a bit and you've gone from 2000 where

199
00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:44.350
there's not enough jobs available and trying to get into a small company of 600

200
00:12:44.351 --> 00:12:47.890
or so.
When you started to literally tens of thousands when you left,

201
00:12:47.891 --> 00:12:50.310
and I hate to say it,
but has gotten bigger since she left out.

202
00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:54.310
<v 0>I know I didn't have to hit 50,000 when the Motorola acquisition with.
Right.</v>

203
00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:58.200
<v 2>And so there's been a lot of change and you were kind of a,</v>

204
00:12:58.201 --> 00:13:00.070
a front row seat to a lot of that change.

205
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.940
So how did that change your approach to both networking and communication?

206
00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:08.200
Because now you have this tremendous stage and you've all of these people who

207
00:13:08.201 --> 00:13:10.240
want your attention and you have to be a filter as well.

208
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:14.130
<v 0>Right?
So on the,
uh,
the,</v>

209
00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:18.690
the first part of that,
the thing that I learned at Google that I'd never really,

210
00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:23.310
I'd never worked for a company that had grown so big so fast.

211
00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:26.400
Um,
people had said to me,

212
00:13:26.401 --> 00:13:29.220
you have to be kind of entrepreneurial when you're at Google.
You know,
it,

213
00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:34.290
you have a lot of room to explore and make things happen.
It did really,

214
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:38.430
I didn't know what that meant really at the beginning.
It didn't really sink in.

215
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:41.790
But the thing that I did discover pretty early,

216
00:13:41.791 --> 00:13:45.270
I was part of the communications team when I finally did get a full time job.

217
00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:50.810
Communications as a team has a wider view of a company than almost any other

218
00:13:51.301 --> 00:13:55.000
team because between all the people,
uh,

219
00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.630
on their beats,
um,
they're,

220
00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:02.430
they're aware of corporate stuff,
you know,
product stuff,
employees stuff.

221
00:14:02.431 --> 00:14:06.870
I mean,
they're,
as a group collectively,
they have a really wide horizon,

222
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:11.730
which I did like because I was a kind of,
I worked with everybody.

223
00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:13.860
I was a floating,
I was,
I was an editor.

224
00:14:13.861 --> 00:14:18.090
It was essentially like the editor that became the editor of the Google blog.

225
00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:21.780
And,
uh,
so in that process,

226
00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:24.090
not only was I working with different people along the way,

227
00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:28.170
but I also realized as I became friendly with people,

228
00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:32.730
they became like my brain trust to help me understand what's happening around

229
00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:37.590
the company.
Not,
not,
you know,
secret launch plans,
but more like,

230
00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:42.360
uh,
early on,
you know,
I have liberal arts degrees.
I mean,

231
00:14:42.361 --> 00:14:47.040
I really didn't even understand the search index in the beginning.
So I,
if I,

232
00:14:47.041 --> 00:14:52.040
if I was friendly with an engineer who did know about,
and they did,
I could,

233
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.530
you know,
like,
help me understand this.

234
00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.990
And out of that came the original thing that was called Google Zeitgeists,

235
00:14:58.010 --> 00:14:59.510
which is now Google trends.

236
00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:03.980
But at the time it was a handpicked from the index,

237
00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:08.750
printed out 50 sheets of paper highlighting things that we thought were spikes.

238
00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:11.060
I mean it was,
it was primitive,

239
00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:15.770
but he was very patient with me and help me understand what that was about.

240
00:15:15.771 --> 00:15:19.310
So then when I had questions about things like that,
I could,

241
00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:24.350
I could go to someone like him,
I'd say,
does this make sense to you?
Or,
you know,

242
00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:28.070
as I began to understand more,
he was like a good reality check.

243
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:30.890
And so were other people across,
you know,

244
00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:35.690
legal and product and product marketing and just different ones.
I mean,

245
00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:40.440
Peter has been here all this time and,
uh,
we,
uh,

246
00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:43.580
used to work on the mighty Google research blog,

247
00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:47.810
which was anomalous to the other blogs.
But that was,
it was awesome.
It had,

248
00:15:47.811 --> 00:15:51.590
it had its own,
its own personality.
So,
um,

249
00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:54.410
I think you have to have your internal network,

250
00:15:54.411 --> 00:15:59.030
especially in a big company that are just informal friends.

251
00:15:59.031 --> 00:16:01.070
You know,
companies not this big.

252
00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:04.790
You can imagine people saying at the water cooler,

253
00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:08.090
I'm so excited about that lunch tomorrow when somebody is saying,

254
00:16:08.091 --> 00:16:13.030
really does legal know about that yet?
Because I'm not,
you know that,

255
00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.140
that I hope doesn't happen here anymore.
But,

256
00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:20.630
but you can appreciate that it has a value to ongoing business,

257
00:16:20.631 --> 00:16:25.280
but it also just enriches your experience so that you understand all the parts

258
00:16:25.281 --> 00:16:29.090
of the business and who's doing what and that people are looking after and

259
00:16:29.091 --> 00:16:31.270
focused on different things.
To me it's,

260
00:16:31.271 --> 00:16:36.271
it's very enriching and I don't know how you can navigate in a company today and

261
00:16:36.381 --> 00:16:37.214
not do that.

262
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:42.310
<v 2>And so networking itself is kind of a private activity.
Yeah,</v>

263
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:43.810
it's talking one to one.

264
00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:47.290
You non-broadcast you mentioned Peter by his first name because to you he's

265
00:16:47.291 --> 00:16:50.170
Peter till I said the people in this room,
he's that guy sitting over there.

266
00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:54.130
And so you have a different level of knowledge base on how well you know them.

267
00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:58.060
So you were able to see Google transform in two ways.

268
00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:00.580
First was going from private company to public.

269
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:04.870
And the second in terms of having that one to one relationship with reporters to

270
00:17:04.871 --> 00:17:09.100
the point where you can broadcast on your own with your blog and Twitter later.

271
00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:11.380
So this is kind of a dual pronged question,

272
00:17:11.381 --> 00:17:14.290
kind of take us through those stories because a lot of people weren't in the

273
00:17:14.291 --> 00:17:18.880
room.
Talk about going public at Google and Twitter.
He did it twice.

274
00:17:19.570 --> 00:17:24.570
And then talk about how did you get a company to go public with a blog and start

275
00:17:26.231 --> 00:17:27.520
to share with the rest of the world.

276
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:33.130
<v 0>So Google is a fantastic story about this because a Google Bot Pyra labs in 2003</v>

277
00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:41.900
which was blogger and from the beginning,
I mean the comms team,

278
00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:42.680
you know,

279
00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:47.680
we all said this is what we should use for our own publishing or you know,

280
00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:51.930
it sort of corporate publishing mechanism instead of press releases,

281
00:17:51.931 --> 00:17:56.070
which was the old fashioned way we googled it and put out that many press

282
00:17:56.071 --> 00:18:00.270
releases to begin with.
And that it's a very arcane way of doing things,
not,

283
00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:04.020
not Google style.
So there was not a lot of,
uh,

284
00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:09.090
opposition to the concept at all for the question was more,
well,

285
00:18:09.091 --> 00:18:14.040
how,
what's the sort of approval flow in the workflow and things like that.

286
00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:15.300
And um,

287
00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:20.330
it took awhile because I think we first kind of announced and published or

288
00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:25.900
unveiled the Google blog in,
uh,

289
00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:30.540
the spring of 2004,
uh,

290
00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.420
after,
uh,
we had filed for the IPO.

291
00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:38.640
So the lawyers were great,
but they were also a little weary about,

292
00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:42.870
you know,
this,
this all has to be,
uh,
you know,

293
00:18:42.871 --> 00:18:46.950
sort of under the rules of business as usual.
No,
no wild stuff here on blogs.

294
00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:47.843
At that time,

295
00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:52.290
people were very anxious about corporate blogs because typically it was more

296
00:18:52.291 --> 00:18:56.760
like an individual employees doing it right rather than a company.

297
00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:00.300
In fact,
the blogger guys at the time said,
a company can't have a blog.

298
00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:06.300
And I said,
it just a publishing platform,
it's not a,
you know,
yes they can.

299
00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:10.290
And then we're going to,
so eventually we got going.

300
00:19:10.291 --> 00:19:13.710
But if you look back at the very beginning of the Google blog,
it's like,

301
00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:17.850
here's a recipe from Charlie.
You know,
it was,

302
00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:19.500
it was the safest,

303
00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:24.860
most non newsworthy stuff because that was all we could sort of get past the

304
00:19:25.141 --> 00:19:25.410
lawyer.

305
00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:30.300
So it took getting past the IPO and then getting some cadence and then

306
00:19:30.301 --> 00:19:32.040
eventually I could,
you know,

307
00:19:32.041 --> 00:19:35.520
kind of institute and editorial calendar because I was on the comms team,

308
00:19:35.521 --> 00:19:40.440
I made sure all the comms people were signed off on the individual topics.
Uh,

309
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:45.330
individual team members from the relevant team would be the writer or at least

310
00:19:45.331 --> 00:19:48.600
drafter of the thing because they were the subject matter experts.

311
00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:51.960
That was from the beginning and I didn't realize it then,

312
00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:56.970
but Google really kind of paved the way for what other companies do in terms of

313
00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:00.990
their own news and information because I made sure it wasn't just product

314
00:20:00.991 --> 00:20:02.340
announced with product announcement.

315
00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:05.940
I wanted interesting stories to come through.

316
00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:11.420
And then over time,
more countries,
more products,
uh,

317
00:20:11.421 --> 00:20:13.110
all wanted their own blogs.
And at one point,

318
00:20:13.111 --> 00:20:16.650
I think we were up above 200 and something.

319
00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:21.930
And that's why there's now this streamlined thing that my wonderful success or

320
00:20:21.931 --> 00:20:25.680
Emily would has put into place.
But,
uh,
and Twitter,

321
00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:28.140
adding Google,
uh,
as a,

322
00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:32.250
as a Twitter account was something I made a case for internally.

323
00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:33.630
It was 2009.

324
00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:37.830
Twitter was already the techies.

325
00:20:37.831 --> 00:20:41.520
We're already a busy on Twitter.
And so we're tech reporters.

326
00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:42.810
So that was my argument.

327
00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:47.800
We had to have a presence there because tech reporters were using it already.

328
00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:52.220
And initially I got some pushback because I,

329
00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:57.160
2009 Google,
I,
plenty of public channels and I,

330
00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:02.320
I'm just said,
we,
because of the kind of company we are,
we,
we have to be there.

331
00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:06.790
And uh,
initially it was we'll have headcount and I said,

332
00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:10.390
you don't need head counts.
This is,
I can do this.
It's not,

333
00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:14.730
it's not a 24,
seven job.
And so,
uh,

334
00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:18.760
I did get the okay to do it,
which was awesome.
And the first tweet was,

335
00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:23.710
I'm feeling lucky in binary,
which was our,
it was a big hit at the time.

336
00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:28.180
It's just because it was different than it sort of announced us.
So,

337
00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:33.310
uh,
um,
but happy that I was part of that and that's how those things happened.

338
00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:37.750
Now,
Twitter is like a different generation practically in terms of as a,

339
00:21:37.751 --> 00:21:41.740
as a company publishing its own stuff.
Yes,

340
00:21:41.741 --> 00:21:45.520
of course they had a Twitter account,
but they,
by the time I got there,

341
00:21:45.521 --> 00:21:46.750
the founders were all gone.

342
00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:50.230
So they didn't have a sort of voice of Twitter biz anymore.

343
00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:54.640
And it was frankly a bigger challenge to have Twitter rep,

344
00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:58.270
the company represented on its own platform.
Ironically,

345
00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:03.190
it was a lot and they had less to talk about and there was less they wanted to

346
00:22:03.191 --> 00:22:07.730
talk about they were having,
you know,
it was not a great time at Twitter,

347
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:12.670
at Twitter back then.
So it was tougher to get a cadence going.
But,
um,

348
00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:16.060
I did kind of institute the same idea of principles about the,

349
00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:17.870
what the blog should be talking about and

350
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:22.720
<v 2>all the names that should be attached to post and stuff.
And then,
uh,
it,</v>

351
00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:26.850
it has morphed a lot even since I've left in terms of how they do it.
I mean,

352
00:22:26.851 --> 00:22:30.540
so much has changed really even over the last five years in terms of sort of

353
00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:34.800
company news and information.
So we talked about this a little bit over lunch,

354
00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:37.290
but working at both Twitter and Google,

355
00:22:37.291 --> 00:22:41.130
you've had to work with some seriously introverted leadership.
Right.

356
00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:46.640
And so how do you encourage people to whom networking is not very easy and

357
00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:51.810
speaking publicly is not very easy to actually go out and do that?

358
00:22:51.811 --> 00:22:54.750
How do you tell them this is a valuable thing and get them to engage?

359
00:22:56.010 --> 00:23:00.390
<v 0>Well,
fortunately that didn't all fall to me,
uh,
to do.
Um,
I found,</v>

360
00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:01.883
you know,

361
00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:06.240
I mean my goal is always to be genuine and helpful honestly.

362
00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:09.300
And so I was in situations where I could do that,

363
00:23:09.301 --> 00:23:14.301
but I was not the advisor talking about media opportunities as much.

364
00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:18.810
I did know that,
um,

365
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:23.870
someone like a Steven Levy who's an editor at large at why are you now,

366
00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:26.790
who's the guy who wrote the big book about Google?

367
00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:32.210
He was a perfect kind of comfort level for lots of people here and that made it

368
00:23:32.551 --> 00:23:36.940
a lot easier for him to get access and write that book.
Um,

369
00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:38.393
and if you don't know,

370
00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:43.170
I think it's still a good book to explain how Google approaches problems.

371
00:23:43.171 --> 00:23:47.600
And thinks about things in the,
in the plex.
Um,

372
00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:52.970
so it depended on,
I mean I would never be in a situation to push,

373
00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:57.140
you know,
uh,
a broadcast TV interview.

374
00:23:57.141 --> 00:23:58.250
Other people would do that.

375
00:23:58.251 --> 00:24:03.251
But I could suggest maybe the off more offbeat sources that had credibility or,

376
00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:09.800
or the more interesting ones that were not necessarily the biggest following but

377
00:24:09.801 --> 00:24:13.580
maybe had influence in areas that the founders are,

378
00:24:13.581 --> 00:24:15.020
some of the executives would care about.

379
00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:18.680
<v 2>You talked about blogs and obviously Twitter having its own Twitter account,</v>

380
00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:22.640
which brings us into this new generation,
like you said,
of social networking.

381
00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:27.890
And so in your book you go through and talk about a mix of real life networking

382
00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:29.750
and also social networking.

383
00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:33.680
What do you think that percentage should look like?
You know,

384
00:24:33.681 --> 00:24:37.940
can someone get away with being a keyboard jockey and just doing email and just

385
00:24:37.941 --> 00:24:42.380
tweeting just enough and just posting Instagram just enough so that you have the

386
00:24:42.381 --> 00:24:44.960
kind of loose ties it reference constantly new book?

387
00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:46.410
<v 0>Yeah,
you can.
I mean that,</v>

388
00:24:46.411 --> 00:24:50.990
that's part of the point of my book is I wasn't like conferred with a lot of

389
00:24:50.991 --> 00:24:55.910
power and visibility that people would want to connect to me.
I mean,

390
00:24:55.911 --> 00:25:00.680
that's,
which is typically how,
that's how maybe Tony Robbins does it.
Right.

391
00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:05.000
But,
uh,
for most of us it's more,
I mean,

392
00:25:05.001 --> 00:25:10.001
we want to be your genuine self and be open to meeting new and interesting

393
00:25:10.521 --> 00:25:15.320
people now and again,
essentially it's,
it's not a,
it's not a 24,

394
00:25:15.321 --> 00:25:15.951
seven calling.

395
00:25:15.951 --> 00:25:20.951
So I do believe that the various social channels make it possible to have to

396
00:25:23.181 --> 00:25:27.470
discover and meet and have relationships with people,

397
00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:32.780
with many more people that was ever possible without that,
uh,
for sure.

398
00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.720
Um,
but it's not a numbers game either.

399
00:25:35.721 --> 00:25:40.721
And so there's nothing that can be sort of a one to one exchange.

400
00:25:41.631 --> 00:25:45.170
However,
the other connections work.
Um,
and I,

401
00:25:45.171 --> 00:25:49.790
it in a way I learned that at Google too because it was the first kind of truly

402
00:25:49.791 --> 00:25:53.450
international company I worked for where we'd have global offsite once a year

403
00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:57.080
and everybody would be together for a week and we'd socialize.

404
00:25:57.470 --> 00:26:01.640
And even if you only worked with somebody or other on your team a little bit,

405
00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:06.940
just the fact that you'd had some social interaction and sometime together for a

406
00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:11.270
week a year really strengthened the online relationship,
right,

407
00:26:11.271 --> 00:26:15.770
that you'd go back to.
So I do think that's valuable,
but you can,

408
00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:20.120
we're so used to sort of these sort of momentary touches with people,

409
00:26:20.121 --> 00:26:22.530
whether it's a Twitter DM or even,

410
00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:26.090
or even just an open tweet and a few of your friends respond and you have a

411
00:26:26.091 --> 00:26:28.880
little thread,
uh,
you know,
uh,

412
00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:33.740
linkedin was kind of built for a certain kind of online connection obviously.

413
00:26:33.741 --> 00:26:38.270
And it works pretty well for that.
Um,
for,
for its,

414
00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:42.260
its main purpose,
um,
Instagram,
uh,

415
00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:47.100
like Twitter lets you follow people you don't know,

416
00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:51.930
right?
And you can have a way to contact them.

417
00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:54.870
Uh,
this is,
uh,
these are unlike Facebook,

418
00:26:54.871 --> 00:26:59.740
which was not really designed for this sort of asymmetrical,
uh,

419
00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:04.680
networking that,
that was much more,
you know,
your friends and family.
So,
uh,

420
00:27:04.681 --> 00:27:07.740
so I do talk in the book about making use of those,

421
00:27:07.741 --> 00:27:10.530
whichever ones you're comfortable on and where people are,

422
00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:14.910
you're connecting to our are on a,
so that,
you know,

423
00:27:14.911 --> 00:27:19.020
part of my day,
every day is probably a few Twitter dms,

424
00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:21.420
a couple of text messages,
you know,

425
00:27:21.421 --> 00:27:26.310
a couple of Facebook message messenger post or something like that.

426
00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:30.450
Uh,
we're,
I'm just saying,
Hey,
thought of you saw this,
how are you,
you know,

427
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:33.120
let's talk soon.
It's not a,

428
00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:37.290
it's not a heavy lift and it's not an obligatory response.

429
00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:40.230
It's more just like,
I'm thinking of you right now.

430
00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:42.960
<v 2>So you mentioned asymmetrical connections and yeah.</v>

431
00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:46.440
So one thing I talked about a lot is asynchronous versus synchronous following.

432
00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:50.130
And you know,
yeah.
In the early days it was very clear in Facebook,

433
00:27:50.131 --> 00:27:51.090
I'm connected to Karen.

434
00:27:51.091 --> 00:27:54.400
Karen's connected to me and it can't just be one way and Twitter,

435
00:27:54.401 --> 00:27:55.650
and it was never the case,
you know,

436
00:27:55.651 --> 00:27:58.890
so I could follow you and you didn't have to know who I was.
Right.

437
00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:02.790
But I would see your updates and I could respond to you.
Yeah.
Uh,

438
00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:06.870
and they've made it so that you can possibly only see responses from people who

439
00:28:06.871 --> 00:28:10.290
you've already connected to or you can filter those down.

440
00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:12.660
But do you see that there's some kind of value?

441
00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:16.440
Is Does it even count as networking to just be aware of what people are doing?

442
00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:18.930
<v 0>Yes.
I mean it's a part of it.</v>

443
00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:23.840
Being aware and curious about what other people are doing is definitely a piece

444
00:28:23.841 --> 00:28:28.670
of connecting to people because it just helps you when you,
it gives you context,

445
00:28:28.671 --> 00:28:32.960
right?
For when you do have occasion to meet someone,
uh,

446
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:37.490
or you know,
want to meet someone that you have some,
you know,

447
00:28:37.491 --> 00:28:38.480
a little more context.

448
00:28:38.481 --> 00:28:43.340
And the context now is sort of richer than just the job history.
Right?

449
00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:44.240
It,
it,
if,

450
00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:49.260
if people have public accounts and you see that,

451
00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:51.220
uh,
you know,
uh,

452
00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:55.970
Google alum who's got an interesting approach and following as hunter walk,

453
00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:01.040
who's now a VC with home brew.
And so he's posting,
you know,

454
00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:02.750
he and his wife and daughter,

455
00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:06.150
like go to a nail salon and they all get their nails painted and you know where

456
00:29:06.151 --> 00:29:09.560
they,
I mean he's wherever he is.
And so you meet them and you think,
oh yeah,

457
00:29:09.561 --> 00:29:13.670
you went to the Museum of ice cream or you know,
he uh,

458
00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:18.910
he posted something funny that's fair game for a person you've never met because

459
00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:24.410
he,
he posted it and it's public and you,
you have a little bit of ground to,
to,

460
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:29.000
you know,
be comment on together that you can sort of meet in the middle and be,

461
00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:31.610
you know,
kind of sociable about a personable,

462
00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:35.500
<v 2>oh,
you mentioned that.
So in your book,
you talk a lot about,
you know,</v>

463
00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:39.200
doing the minimum standard to get into one of these networks,

464
00:29:39.201 --> 00:29:42.280
but you have to be authentic.
You know,
you just tweet a few links

465
00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.180
<v 0>and then disappear.</v>

466
00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:46.720
But you also have people on the other side of the spectrum who share everything,

467
00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:50.200
right?
And they don't stop and you meet them or whatever,

468
00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:53.800
but they just continue and continue because there's different personalities that

469
00:29:53.801 --> 00:29:55.420
take place in all these networks,
including,

470
00:29:55.421 --> 00:29:57.900
I think you said it'd be at the communicator,

471
00:29:57.910 --> 00:30:00.700
the first new pontificates makes comments and everything.

472
00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:05.060
How do you find your lane or you just know what it is?
I mean,
no,
you the,

473
00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.480
I mean you,
okay.
Here's,

474
00:30:07.481 --> 00:30:11.980
I tried out now my favorite quote from the book from a guy named Ivan Meisner,

475
00:30:11.981 --> 00:30:13.000
which is,
um,

476
00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:18.190
think of networking less like hunting and more like farming or if you like

477
00:30:18.191 --> 00:30:22.240
substitute gardening for farming.
So the idea is you're,

478
00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:26.320
you're nurturing,
you're watering,
you're planting,
you're trimming your weeding,

479
00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:30.250
you're plowing under,
you're replanting,
uh,

480
00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:34.360
we're hunting and it's very transactional,
shall we say,
a one,
a one hit.

481
00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:39.280
And so,
um,
you,
you're,
you know,
you don't,
I mean,

482
00:30:39.281 --> 00:30:43.660
I kind of built my online connections over time just by,
oh,

483
00:30:43.661 --> 00:30:46.630
this person's interesting.
I,
I have something in common with them.

484
00:30:46.631 --> 00:30:50.470
They are interested in the same things I am,
uh,
I didn't meet them,

485
00:30:50.471 --> 00:30:54.640
maybe it at Google,
but,
uh,
I followed them.
I know what they're doing now.

486
00:30:54.641 --> 00:30:58.930
I want to be connected.
I mean it's,
it's,
it's a long game,
right?
And that's a,

487
00:30:58.931 --> 00:31:03.010
it's a sort of ongoing process of cultivation and nurturing.

488
00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:07.370
You talk a little bit about,
a lot about the loose connections.
Yeah.

489
00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:10.120
And so when you look at these loose connections,
first of all,

490
00:31:10.121 --> 00:31:14.920
you can define what that means and then the second for people who are loose

491
00:31:14.921 --> 00:31:19.900
connection,
who might not have a direct overlap with a job,
does that matter?
Like,

492
00:31:19.901 --> 00:31:21.910
do engineers need to connect to marketing people?

493
00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:26.720
I would never mandate such a thing.
Uh,
no.
I mean it's,

494
00:31:26.721 --> 00:31:29.290
it's based on sort of who you like.

495
00:31:29.291 --> 00:31:32.510
I find an interesting thing though that,
uh,

496
00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:34.630
in the time since I've left Google,

497
00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:39.630
Google to me is such a worldclass network of people past and present.

498
00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:42.430
I mean,
literally at the door here,

499
00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:45.760
guy waved that I worked with 15 years ago.

500
00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:50.230
I may be the last time,
some eight or 10 years ago,

501
00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:54.730
and,
you know,
he couldn't stay the day I'm going to follow up and just say,

502
00:31:54.731 --> 00:31:59.560
I miss you.
How are you?
You know,
uh,
it,
it's,
it's very,

503
00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:03.940
um,
it can be very intermittent and there's no prescription about,

504
00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:07.600
you know,
roles or history.
Even it,
it's more,

505
00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:11.880
it's more just who do you like,
what associations you might have,
um,

506
00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:14.620
with a place I'm sure a,
um,

507
00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:19.330
a company that fosters and encourages,
uh,
uh,

508
00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:24.220
collaboration and cross team work and relationships and friendships,

509
00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:27.730
uh,
does better in the longterm networking realm.

510
00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:32.530
Then one that is very siloed.
Um,
just a guess.

511
00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:36.850
You talk specifically about a all hands where people flew in from around the

512
00:32:36.851 --> 00:32:39.920
globe and met here.
You still have relationships.
Yeah.

513
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:44.570
<v 2>But the reality is,
you know,
both of you and I had dogs and we wouldn't,</v>

514
00:32:44.571 --> 00:32:47.270
we rather walk a dog around the park two times,

515
00:32:47.271 --> 00:32:51.110
then go to some event in the city and walk around the room for two times.

516
00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:56.000
I'd rather walk the dog.
Yeah.
So do I have to go to this corporate party?

517
00:32:56.420 --> 00:33:00.890
<v 0>Oh,
okay.
So,
uh,
uh,
global offsite is not probably,</v>

518
00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:05.840
uh,
an optional thing.
It's different than the holiday party,
I would say.

519
00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:10.730
Uh,
you probably do have to participate fully in the offsite and that,

520
00:33:10.731 --> 00:33:13.130
that's probably a good thing all around.
Uh,

521
00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:18.050
I do write about corporate parties because they're not really networking

522
00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:22.700
opportunities.
I don't think they are.
They are,
they may or may not be obligatory,

523
00:33:22.701 --> 00:33:25.400
but they are a more of a political

524
00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:28.910
statement perhaps.
And by that,

525
00:33:28.911 --> 00:33:32.720
I mean I'm not at a company this big,

526
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:37.210
but it smaller companies,
you need to be seen as a team player,
right?

527
00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:40.340
You need to be,
uh,
you know,

528
00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:45.020
kind of part of the group and going along with things.
So in a small company,
uh,

529
00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:47.300
it's not really,
it's not for fun.

530
00:33:47.301 --> 00:33:50.240
It really is a work obligation to go to the holiday party.

531
00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:54.980
What I say in the book is you do not have to stay all night at the company
party.

532
00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:59.660
Make sure you're seen by a couple of the people you need to be seen by and then,

533
00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:02.900
you know,
make a,
make an exit.
But they're not the same thing.

534
00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:06.570
<v 2>No,
absolutely not.
No,
I was just bridging.
Okay.
Okay.</v>

535
00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:12.090
So you also mentioned the book that the people that you need aren't always those

536
00:34:12.761 --> 00:34:16.240
who are doing the hiring.
So can you explain that?
Yup.

537
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:19.340
<v 0>In fact,
mostly you know,
you know how it works.</v>

538
00:34:19.341 --> 00:34:22.670
I mean mostly if your friend says,
uh,

539
00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:25.520
I've already applied and I'd love to meet the hiring manager,

540
00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:28.460
that's just not going to happen.
That's just not how it works.

541
00:34:28.461 --> 00:34:30.580
Especially in a big company.
Um,

542
00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:36.020
you don't meet the hiring manager before many other steps happen.
Um,

543
00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:41.440
but you may want Intel about a team or the manager of the team or the future of

544
00:34:43.371 --> 00:34:47.540
the product line or uh,
you know,
what,

545
00:34:47.541 --> 00:34:52.280
what the dynamics are of the group and do they have cooperation from the other,

546
00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:53.300
you know,
surrounding groups.

547
00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:57.470
You may want all kinds of Intel about what it's like to work there and who the

548
00:34:57.471 --> 00:35:01.790
other people are and all that kind of stuff.
So that's,
that's,
you know,

549
00:35:01.791 --> 00:35:06.410
no one person is going to have,
like,
here's the entire answer to your job quest.

550
00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:10.820
I know everything that you need to know about it.
It's going to be,
like I said,

551
00:35:10.821 --> 00:35:13.850
a long game.
One person has this piece of the puzzle,

552
00:35:13.851 --> 00:35:16.170
somebody knows about the product,
uh,

553
00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:21.080
by ability or has strong opinions about it that are somewhat informed and you

554
00:35:21.081 --> 00:35:23.600
know,
someone else has been on the team for a while.

555
00:35:23.601 --> 00:35:28.130
Someone else can tell you maybe the history of how the group has evolved,
uh,

556
00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:30.980
you know,
different people along the way that you might meet.

557
00:35:30.981 --> 00:35:35.320
And so that's how you,
it's like a journalism effort really.
You're,

558
00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:40.330
you're kind of the reporter trying to put together a story for yourself that

559
00:35:40.471 --> 00:35:45.150
makes sense.
And that informs your interviews when you get to that point.

560
00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:49.090
<v 2>And so one thing that has happened are you,
when you started at Google,</v>

561
00:35:49.091 --> 00:35:53.020
it was literally a 17 years ago.
Yeah.
And so the company has changed,

562
00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:56.510
but so have the products that are being offered for sure as the technology.
Yeah.

563
00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:58.790
And so I think about this sometimes,
you know,

564
00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:03.310
my previous role and the previous company I once asked to have everybody's

565
00:36:03.311 --> 00:36:06.160
birthdays so that we could publish them in an internal newsletter.

566
00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:10.570
The enterprising HR person who responded,
no,
only sent me everyone's birthdays,

567
00:36:10.571 --> 00:36:12.620
but included their birth year.
Ah,

568
00:36:12.850 --> 00:36:16.060
and then sorted from oldest to youngest and I was down at the bottom.

569
00:36:16.061 --> 00:36:17.800
I was like the third youngest person in the company.

570
00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:21.970
Clearly personally identifiable information,
big mistake.

571
00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:26.110
But I'm no longer the third youngest person in the company.
Right.
Neither of you.

572
00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:28.990
Right.
And as things have changed,

573
00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:32.170
and you talked about the fact that sixty's the new 40,

574
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:37.910
but also it's really hard to reboot your career at age 40 or 50 or 60.

575
00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:38.590
Sure.

576
00:36:38.590 --> 00:36:42.910
So is networking more important because the world is changing underneath it or

577
00:36:42.911 --> 00:36:45.490
do you just going to hold onto your people and move forward?

578
00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:49.300
<v 0>Honestly,
I have to say it's more important,
um,</v>

579
00:36:50.350 --> 00:36:54.010
holding on and sort of,
you know,
hoping no one's really noticing is,

580
00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:58.840
I mean that's a,
has a limited success rate right.
At were,

581
00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:02.260
um,
if you continue,

582
00:37:02.261 --> 00:37:05.950
if basically if you have a growth mindset,
if you're,
if you're curious,

583
00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:10.120
if you're willing to evolve,
if you,
if you're open to learning new things,

584
00:37:10.121 --> 00:37:12.490
open to meeting new people,
open to having new thoughts,

585
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:17.290
that's the thing that keeps you going.
Correct.

586
00:37:19.450 --> 00:37:21.820
Um,
and you know,

587
00:37:21.821 --> 00:37:26.320
in a way I used to joke that I was the oldest person at Google at the time

588
00:37:26.321 --> 00:37:29.290
because I am older than Eric.
However,
uh,

589
00:37:29.291 --> 00:37:32.590
then Google hired Vint cerf and Vint is older than I am.

590
00:37:32.830 --> 00:37:37.830
And so he became kind of an inspiration for me because he's awesome and like an

591
00:37:39.401 --> 00:37:43.210
insane world traveler in this three piece suits.
So,
um,

592
00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:48.400
it's really not,
uh,
we all have a age discrimination.

593
00:37:48.401 --> 00:37:48.881
I do too.

594
00:37:48.881 --> 00:37:53.050
I will characterize someone as being too old and I mean it's in their mind,

595
00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:54.790
you know,
it's like they don't have,

596
00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:59.680
they don't have a growth mindset I guess is maybe the way to say it.
But,
um,

597
00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:04.030
we all have to kind of watch for that.
But I think the,
the answer,

598
00:38:04.031 --> 00:38:06.010
if you fear it is better,

599
00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:10.720
step out a little wider rather than kind of hope no one notices me

600
00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:16.240
<v 2>sticking with demographics that are uncomfortable for $800.
Yeah,</v>

601
00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:21.330
you are a female.
And so as a woman who's networking,

602
00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:22.980
those are,
I mean,

603
00:38:22.981 --> 00:38:25.800
you talked about Twitter being a really hostile place for weather sometimes and

604
00:38:25.801 --> 00:38:28.470
you kind of railed against it and not talking about while you worked there.

605
00:38:28.471 --> 00:38:31.290
But I mean,
as a platform,
just to clarify.
Yeah.

606
00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:37.040
But as a female who's outwardly networking to find that it's easier than what

607
00:38:37.271 --> 00:38:39.760
you're thinking,
your male counterparts,
you're having it or is it harder?

608
00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:44.540
Do you find that going out for coffee or sending an email,
um,

609
00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:47.950
to a,
sometimes gets the wrong response?
Are People looking at it the wrong way?

610
00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:52.630
<v 0>So to me,
for me where I am and you know,
my,</v>

611
00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:55.620
I'm 67,
so for me the,

612
00:38:55.710 --> 00:39:00.710
the age factor has kind of trumped the woman factor.

613
00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:04.740
Uh,
and in a way that's lucky.
Uh,

614
00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:09.830
I think it's very interesting because I was considered,

615
00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:14.400
you know,
maybe an anomalous person who worked in silicon valley,

616
00:39:14.401 --> 00:39:17.700
but nonetheless,
someone who kind of fit in and,
uh,
you know,

617
00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:22.530
had been around a long time.
I mean,
I had some credibility,
uh,
so that,
um,

618
00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:24.810
uh,
helped me,

619
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:29.250
I was not party to a bunch of uncomfortable exchanges.

620
00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:32.640
On the other hand,
when you're older,
you're also more invisible.

621
00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:37.890
And in a way I find that kind of a superpower because nobody pays attention to

622
00:39:37.891 --> 00:39:40.080
you and it's,
and if you're a woman,

623
00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:43.020
you know that you're there also not listening to what you're saying in a
meeting,

624
00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:48.780
but which is not always good.
But,
uh,
at the same time,

625
00:39:48.781 --> 00:39:49.890
it's kind of interesting.

626
00:39:50.370 --> 00:39:54.750
Maybe it all ties to being an introvert because I observe and I watch and I kind

627
00:39:54.751 --> 00:39:58.260
of take my own council and kind of react later.

628
00:39:58.290 --> 00:40:00.690
But I can observe the scene and watch how people are.

629
00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:04.330
But I do think that for me personally,
I'm,

630
00:40:04.331 --> 00:40:09.230
I'm sure I wasn't seriously considered certain times in my career,

631
00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:09.431
not,

632
00:40:09.431 --> 00:40:14.431
not just at Google by any means for different roles or something because some

633
00:40:15.061 --> 00:40:17.730
guy was friends with another guy.
I'm sure that has happened,

634
00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:22.110
but at the same time,
you know,
I mean,
I made my own way.
Uh,

635
00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:24.630
and I think honestly,

636
00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:29.690
being kind of a of a few years ahead was beneficial to me oddly,

637
00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:35.400
and never really gotten my way at all at Google or Twitter for that matter.

638
00:40:35.401 --> 00:40:39.660
And earlier on,
uh,
I was at a lot of smaller companies and you know,

639
00:40:39.661 --> 00:40:42.060
computer publications,
um,

640
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:47.010
where there wasn't as much of an age consciousness gap at that time.

641
00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:51.300
Uh,
and it didn't have this yet.
So maybe that made a difference too.

642
00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:56.660
<v 2>So when you talked you and you introduced your book in mountain view,</v>

643
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:59.960
this was about a couple of my second book sink had a book signing.

644
00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:04.280
So I asked you a question,
which I'm going to repeat.

645
00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:05.690
So you're already ready for this one.
Okay.

646
00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:09.770
So at Twitter you tweet and you got 140 characters.

647
00:41:09.771 --> 00:41:12.380
Now it's 280 maybe you were able to add a photo,

648
00:41:12.381 --> 00:41:16.040
but it's pretty concise and you're owned by a container and a blog is more open

649
00:41:16.041 --> 00:41:19.550
ended,
but it's not a hundred pages.
Right.
Your book is.

650
00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:24.940
So how did you take on this uncomfortable challenge of having to write for a

651
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:26.001
long form?

652
00:41:26.001 --> 00:41:29.360
And obviously what you're doing is kind of like a book tour and a book signing

653
00:41:29.361 --> 00:41:30.080
tour.

654
00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:32.600
These are probably outside your comfort zone because you haven't done it before.

655
00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:33.680
Right.
How'd you do it?

656
00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:38.360
<v 0>Uh,
well,
you know,
I,
I mean,
I knew enough about publishing to say,</v>

657
00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:41.450
if I get an agent and they sell a proposal,

658
00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:44.750
I meant I'm gonna follow this adventure.
I know,

659
00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:47.660
I know what's generally entailed here.
I'm,
I'll,
I'll do it.

660
00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:52.490
I just thought that I did know it would be a problem to write long because I'm

661
00:41:52.491 --> 00:41:57.020
not used to writing long.
I mean,
I've written for online,
you know,

662
00:41:57.021 --> 00:41:59.630
a thousand words is more than enough most of the time.

663
00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:04.670
So He'd get the contract and it says 60 to 80,000 words and I thought,

664
00:42:04.671 --> 00:42:08.060
I'm just not going to pay attention to that right now.
I can't.
But the,

665
00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:11.810
but the simple answer to writing long is you just have to break it down.

666
00:42:11.811 --> 00:42:16.130
So I would pay attention not to the metal length.
And,
you know,

667
00:42:16.131 --> 00:42:19.760
I would be more like follow,
I had to learn how to make a good outline,

668
00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:21.710
which I hadn't done since school.

669
00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:25.940
And then literally go to the outline and say,
okay,
that's next.

670
00:42:25.941 --> 00:42:30.380
And then that's next.
I mean it was,
that was hard.
That was really,
you know,

671
00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:35.310
Butt in seat type work to,
to make,
and then one day,
uh,

672
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:40.310
my editor said,
let's just count up how,
how far you are,
you know,
and she just,

673
00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:41.930
I did it all on Google docs.

674
00:42:41.931 --> 00:42:45.830
And so she just sort of did a rough count of every chapter.
I was like,
wow,

675
00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:50.780
I'm at 43,000 words already,
so you will see it.
It's not a long book.

676
00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:55.100
There's sidebars with exercises.
There's epigraphs for every chapter.

677
00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:59.300
Uh,
cause I,
that's as long as it needed to be in the,
actually,

678
00:42:59.301 --> 00:43:03.500
that's what my editor told me to.
He didn't have to kind of overly repeat,

679
00:43:03.501 --> 00:43:05.900
but it was,
it was a slog.
It was something I had to learn.

680
00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:10.550
Same with going out and talking about it.
I mean,
in a way I'm not,

681
00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:14.480
uh,
it's not my natural state,
but I,

682
00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:17.570
if I had to do it for the rest of my life,
I don't know.

683
00:43:17.571 --> 00:43:21.710
But for some period of months or a year,

684
00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:26.770
I enjoy it because it's not constant and it's fun to talk about and especially

685
00:43:26.871 --> 00:43:27.860
to get the questions.

686
00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:31.440
<v 2>So you talk a lot about getting the first role at Google through people,</v>

687
00:43:31.441 --> 00:43:31.741
you know,

688
00:43:31.741 --> 00:43:34.650
and using the network and helping other people forward and similar at Twitter,

689
00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:37.440
you know,
someone you knew and your existing relationship got you there.

690
00:43:38.130 --> 00:43:43.130
So that sets up this kind of wall where people who don't know you can't get in.

691
00:43:44.310 --> 00:43:48.830
And when you talk about Google getting a million resumes,
a quarter a day,

692
00:43:48.850 --> 00:43:53.220
whatever,
it looks like,
it's a lot.
So there's a two piece on this.
First,

693
00:43:53.221 --> 00:43:58.221
does that mean online job submissions are dead and recruiters should just do

694
00:43:58.771 --> 00:44:00.990
something else?
And then the third thing,

695
00:44:00.991 --> 00:44:04.530
which I'm concerned about is if you only getting in by who,
you know,

696
00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:07.560
doesn't that just submit the diversity problem that we already have?

697
00:44:07.730 --> 00:44:11.110
<v 0>That's very good question.
But I would say,
um,</v>

698
00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:13.450
they're recruiters are not,

699
00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:18.280
are not going away because there are still lots of jobs,
uh,
in the world that,

700
00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:22.750
uh,
follow this,
you know,
CV submission,

701
00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:26.260
uh,
picked out of the pile,
you know,

702
00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:30.310
phone screening process that that goes on.
Um,

703
00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:35.850
the question is really about the higher level jobs and the executive roles and

704
00:44:37.231 --> 00:44:42.231
the roles that are kind of built on relationships and have fostered

705
00:44:42.451 --> 00:44:44.640
relationships with other people in other places.

706
00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:49.830
That's an interesting thing to explore it for me personally,
uh,

707
00:44:49.831 --> 00:44:54.390
I'm,
that's why I'm open to meeting everybody all the time and giving advice.

708
00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:57.150
Even if I don't have direct advice,
I'll go,
I mean,

709
00:44:57.151 --> 00:45:02.151
I will literally Google like a good how to article and send it to someone and

710
00:45:02.191 --> 00:45:03.630
say,
I can't help more than this,

711
00:45:03.631 --> 00:45:07.650
but this is a good source for what you need to do next or what you need to know.

712
00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:12.630
It is a very good question about the idea of,
uh,
you know,

713
00:45:12.631 --> 00:45:17.631
this sort of friends of friends and I don't have a single good answer to that.

714
00:45:18.571 --> 00:45:23.571
I would say that the more people in hiring positions and,

715
00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:25.140
uh,

716
00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:29.910
incumbents accompanies companies are aware of that the more they broadly debt

717
00:45:29.911 --> 00:45:34.470
work,
right for roles,
not just the old,
you know,

718
00:45:34.471 --> 00:45:39.200
example would be ivy league is where the only place we go versus all kind of all

719
00:45:39.201 --> 00:45:40.290
of other kinds of schools.

720
00:45:40.650 --> 00:45:43.980
Now I think we have to say that they don't all have to be four year colleges.

721
00:45:43.981 --> 00:45:48.060
We want to look at a bunch of different variables.
Um,

722
00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:54.430
it,
it,
it's gonna just be a piecemeal improvement.
I think,
uh,

723
00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:58.380
where someone says,
we are determined to find,

724
00:45:58.381 --> 00:46:02.010
we're going to look in more sources and we're going to have a broader definition

725
00:46:02.011 --> 00:46:06.800
of the role and we do not want,
you know,
uh,

726
00:46:06.810 --> 00:46:10.580
the friendly person that we already know we'd like to have a beer with and the,

727
00:46:10.690 --> 00:46:15.240
you know,
famous,
um,
notion.
In fact,
I did interview,

728
00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:18.740
um,
an HR,
uh,

729
00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:23.860
executive because this question of cultural fit has come up a lot,
right?

730
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:27.690
This kind of shorthand for it,
you know,
they,
they fit with us.
They're like us,

731
00:46:27.691 --> 00:46:30.060
you know,
that kind of thing.
And,
uh,

732
00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:35.120
she said that at least in her circle in of HR and training and development

733
00:46:35.791 --> 00:46:40.740
people,
um,
they,
they knew that was a bad construct and they,

734
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:43.890
they don't use that.
They don't want to reference that.

735
00:46:43.891 --> 00:46:48.630
They think instead about one's cultural contribution to a company,

736
00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:53.130
uh,
which is,
uh,
could be narrowly defined,

737
00:46:53.131 --> 00:46:57.840
but hopefully as much more broadly defined as they have their passions and their

738
00:46:57.841 --> 00:47:02.490
interests and they're not all the same.
And they,
they don't all match each other.

739
00:47:02.491 --> 00:47:05.040
They're more like they bring a richness.
So they have a,

740
00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:09.520
they have a contribution to make culturally and socially as well as,
uh,

741
00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:13.920
the job skills.
And I liked that way of thinking about it,
but it,
it takes,

742
00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:17.460
you know,
discipline to actually apply that in every,
all the,

743
00:47:17.461 --> 00:47:19.560
all the steps in the,
in a hiring process.

744
00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:24.300
And so you often talk about having this large network of connections,

745
00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:28.620
but do you also have a really tight network of close connections where you can

746
00:47:28.621 --> 00:47:30.100
be unfiltered in

747
00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:34.840
<v 2>a sat?
Just a relief to not have to be this public face?</v>

748
00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:36.620
<v 0>Uh,
well for sure,</v>

749
00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:40.850
but I'm not sure I'm this public face that much of the time to be honest.
I mean,

750
00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:45.410
we all do,
you know,
when you actually get together with someone face to face,

751
00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:50.750
uh,
that's hopefully going to be more personable,

752
00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:53.420
personal and more,
um,
you know,

753
00:47:53.421 --> 00:47:57.760
unfiltered than even watching what you tweet or something like that or what you

754
00:47:57.770 --> 00:48:01.670
or what you choose to write about.
Um,
we all need that too.
You know,

755
00:48:01.671 --> 00:48:05.930
we need the intimacy of the actual,
you know,

756
00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:10.820
direct connection as well as I think this broader world that,

757
00:48:10.850 --> 00:48:13.040
that helps us in a lot of things that we do.

758
00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:15.101
<v 2>So,
cliff,</v>

759
00:48:15.101 --> 00:48:18.790
I think we have the option for anyone else in the audience who's live to ask

760
00:48:18.791 --> 00:48:23.590
questions if you do have them.
Uh,
so you mentioned the levy who is great,

761
00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:28.300
uh,
what other reporters were good to work with and it was bad to work with.

762
00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:32.670
<v 0>Well,
I,
I,
I mean actually it's interesting,</v>

763
00:48:32.671 --> 00:48:37.080
the whole scene has changed so much.
Um,
you know,
uh,

764
00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:40.650
it used to be there were the big band stream outlets and then a bunch of

765
00:48:40.651 --> 00:48:45.651
bloggers and now we can't really make that differentiation as is the same way.

766
00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:51.230
So Steven Levy is a wonderful long form reporter and not a sort of day of scoop

767
00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:56.860
type reporter.
Um,
you know,
there's actually too many to name,
um,

768
00:48:57.510 --> 00:49:01.350
who were covering Google.
But you know,
most of the,

769
00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:06.210
maybe this is a fudging on the question,
I don't know.
Uh,
but you know,

770
00:49:06.270 --> 00:49:08.910
it's a relationship business too,
right?
It's,
it's,

771
00:49:08.970 --> 00:49:13.170
it's ongoing conversations and by the way,
not just when you need something.

772
00:49:13.171 --> 00:49:13.880
I mean,
it's,

773
00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:18.880
it really mirrors the same idea of connecting with people so that you can give

774
00:49:19.381 --> 00:49:23.790
context and be off the record and kind of let them know something's coming

775
00:49:23.791 --> 00:49:25.650
without saying what it is.
And if it's a,

776
00:49:25.651 --> 00:49:28.860
it's very much a good relationship network.
Um,

777
00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:33.630
I would say that the publications,
uh,
you know,

778
00:49:34.110 --> 00:49:38.790
have changed so much,
you know,
buzzfeed,
uh,
and,
um,

779
00:49:39.570 --> 00:49:41.300
uh,
vox is,
you know,

780
00:49:41.310 --> 00:49:46.310
maybe these are things that didn't exist a few years ago by sometimes there are

781
00:49:47.730 --> 00:49:50.370
many more outlets than the main stream.

782
00:49:50.490 --> 00:49:55.490
The reporters change though because there are not in a long term stable jobs for

783
00:49:56.701 --> 00:50:01.590
the most part.
And so they move around.
So someone like Mike Isaac for example,

784
00:50:02.010 --> 00:50:05.100
uh,
you know,
kind of cut his teeth a little bit at recode,

785
00:50:05.101 --> 00:50:09.960
I'm wired and now he's at the New York Times,
um,
uh,

786
00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:14.880
finishing his book on Uber,
which we're all waiting for us.
So,
um,
you know,

787
00:50:14.970 --> 00:50:15.450
uh,

788
00:50:15.450 --> 00:50:19.110
the cast of characters in a way has changed and some of the practice has changed

789
00:50:19.111 --> 00:50:20.820
because it's not about,

790
00:50:21.090 --> 00:50:24.990
I mean years before even Google for a long time in PR,

791
00:50:24.991 --> 00:50:26.760
it was the long form,

792
00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:31.070
which was magazines over three months out the short form,

793
00:50:31.071 --> 00:50:35.180
which was newspapers.
And then here came this other thing,
the blogs,
right.

794
00:50:35.181 --> 00:50:39.350
And it's like,
it's just some,
so much a different landscape.
Now.

795
00:50:40.330 --> 00:50:45.330
<v 3>I was wondering like what your perspective is on like networking events where</v>

796
00:50:45.810 --> 00:50:46.270
it's,

797
00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:49.270
cause you talk a lot about the current relationships where you're working with

798
00:50:49.271 --> 00:50:51.610
someone,
but where it's a,
you know,

799
00:50:51.611 --> 00:50:53.950
there's a networking event that you're hosting that someone's hosting,

800
00:50:53.951 --> 00:50:56.890
whether like would you attend it or not or what your take is.

801
00:50:57.060 --> 00:51:02.060
<v 0>If it was really just like the purpose of this event is to like make people and</v>

802
00:51:02.641 --> 00:51:06.630
come home with business cards or contacts beamed between bones.

803
00:51:07.370 --> 00:51:12.360
I questioned like,
that's like a weird speed dating kind of thing.

804
00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:16.080
And that's why I think people hate the idea of networking is that's what they

805
00:51:16.081 --> 00:51:19.400
think of is hotel ballroom.
I have,

806
00:51:19.410 --> 00:51:23.040
I'm gonna make myself stay 30 minutes and I'm going to come away with three

807
00:51:23.041 --> 00:51:27.270
business cards or you know,
whatever.
That's what,
but if it was a conference,

808
00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:31.710
uh,
then that's a little different where there may be common interest.

809
00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:33.870
You might be there for a day or two.

810
00:51:33.930 --> 00:51:36.360
You're going to have a little small talk with this one and that one.

811
00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:39.630
There might be a legitimate moment of connection.

812
00:51:39.810 --> 00:51:43.590
You wouldn't do a whole networking thing there.
You'd follow up,

813
00:51:44.010 --> 00:51:49.010
but that's more natural than just like network to find your next job at this

814
00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:51.810
event.
That is about that.

815
00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:55.260
I think I wouldn't do that personally and I think those are,

816
00:51:55.261 --> 00:51:57.240
that's their painful,
those things.

817
00:51:57.241 --> 00:52:00.390
I don't know if anyone's had a good experience at one of those.

818
00:52:00.391 --> 00:52:01.350
Does anyone do those?

819
00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:06.610
<v 3>Uh,
if I could ask you to summarize the whole book in one formula.</v>

820
00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:11.230
<v 0>Well,
it wouldn't be a formula because I'm a liberal arts major.</v>

821
00:52:13.690 --> 00:52:18.280
Well,
you know,
it,
it might be this guy's quote Ivan Meisner.
Uh,
you know,

822
00:52:18.281 --> 00:52:22.510
networking is more like farming than hunting to paraphrase.

823
00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:25.750
Um,
in other words,
it's seasonal.

824
00:52:25.810 --> 00:52:29.290
It's a long game and you're continuing to attended.

825
00:52:29.830 --> 00:52:34.240
So in essence,
I think that would be what I'd say.

826
00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:38.320
The other thing I might add is,
um,
people want to help each other.

827
00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:40.240
It's just you have to help,

828
00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:45.300
you have to give context and have some kind of richness around what you're

829
00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:50.320
seeking are asking.
But people like to help each other if they can.

830
00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:55.600
<v 3>Uh,
when you reach out to people and was an introvert,</v>

831
00:52:55.601 --> 00:52:58.090
I have a problem where you don't know what to say.

832
00:52:58.091 --> 00:52:59.890
Like you don't have a purpose in mind.

833
00:52:59.891 --> 00:53:02.140
Like what do you do that and if you reach out to people,

834
00:53:02.141 --> 00:53:03.360
do they always respond to you?

835
00:53:03.390 --> 00:53:08.080
Especially with people where you have nothing really you need to say and you

836
00:53:08.081 --> 00:53:09.940
don't have,
you don't know each other that well.

837
00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:14.980
<v 0>I think I'd wonder why you're reaching out in the first place.
Is it,
is it,</v>

838
00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:18.070
what would make you reach out to someone you don't know?

839
00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:20.600
<v 3>Uh,
like in general because</v>

840
00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:24.230
<v 0>like someone tells you it's a good idea to yeah,
make more contact.
Okay.</v>

841
00:53:24.850 --> 00:53:27.630
You need context,
right?
So if,
if it's,

842
00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:32.550
if it's just like linkedin kind of set this up in a way that is,

843
00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:36.450
I guess somewhat useful,
but,
but not entirely useful.
Right.

844
00:53:36.451 --> 00:53:41.430
Where you send somebody that canned language,
I'd like to join your network.

845
00:53:41.970 --> 00:53:43.500
Don't do that.
Right?
Don't,

846
00:53:43.501 --> 00:53:47.700
don't just send the canned message that's not from you.
Uh,

847
00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:51.330
they make it easy to overwrite that and say,

848
00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:55.830
I'm interested in,
you know,
your career as a product manager.

849
00:53:55.831 --> 00:54:00.831
I'm interested in how you got to that company or what,

850
00:54:01.550 --> 00:54:05.280
you know,
you've written about something in Ai.
Um,
I want to know more about that.

851
00:54:05.281 --> 00:54:10.000
So you,
you immediately brings some reason for it,
uh,

852
00:54:10.050 --> 00:54:12.330
to the front.
And that's when people are like,
oh,

853
00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:16.620
that's kind of flattering and maybe I,
you know,
I,
I will respond to that.

854
00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:20.910
However briefly,
no,
people do not always respond.
Um,

855
00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:25.200
and that's just kind of,
uh,
the way it goes.

856
00:54:25.201 --> 00:54:28.380
I think the law of large numbers or something,
if you're trying,

857
00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:33.270
I do find that the better,
your odds are always better if you can say,

858
00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:37.350
I have a friend of so and so's or even better,
your friend introduces you.

859
00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:41.280
But beyond that,
uh,
if,
if you're just reached,
you say,

860
00:54:41.281 --> 00:54:44.880
I know somebody at someone has spoken highly of you or I heard you talk or I

861
00:54:44.881 --> 00:54:49.800
read your paper,
um,
I would love to have,
uh,
you know,

862
00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:54.570
20 minutes or could you respond to this and send me a link to your paper?

863
00:54:54.690 --> 00:54:58.340
Or could we have a 20 minute call?
Or um,

864
00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:02.700
if we're both local,
you know,
could I buy you coffee one day or you know,

865
00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:06.810
something like that.
That it's like not a heavy obligation for them.

866
00:55:06.810 --> 00:55:08.010
There's not a time limit.

867
00:55:08.011 --> 00:55:12.210
And you're saying I'd really like to know more and maybe you don't ask it all at

868
00:55:12.211 --> 00:55:13.920
once.
Maybe it's just me.

869
00:55:13.921 --> 00:55:18.570
I ask you a few questions about this thing and you know,

870
00:55:18.571 --> 00:55:21.990
I think people will respond if they have that kind of context.

871
00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:25.110
Maybe it's not as full as you'd like or sometimes people will say,

872
00:55:25.111 --> 00:55:27.210
yeah actually I'm,

873
00:55:27.830 --> 00:55:30.600
I'm at based on who you are and your background.
Yeah,

874
00:55:30.601 --> 00:55:33.030
I would love to talk shop with you about it.

875
00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:36.900
Cause I can see you have some background that's related,
something like that.

876
00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:42.210
So,
but you do bring something,
you're not asking a favor in the sense of,

877
00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:44.130
please help me.
You're just saying,

878
00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:48.990
I'd like to know more or this interests me.
Can you,
you know,

879
00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:50.490
would you take time to tell me more?

880
00:55:50.491 --> 00:55:54.660
It's not like I need a job and I have to apply tomorrow.
You know,

881
00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:59.160
that's when that will not get a response,
a good response most of the time.

882
00:56:00.620 --> 00:56:03.110
<v 3>Hi,
thanks for coming.
So,
um,</v>

883
00:56:03.130 --> 00:56:07.340
when I read about the history of companies like Google and Twitter and all these

884
00:56:07.341 --> 00:56:11.590
other technology companies,
how they were started,
how they were felons,

885
00:56:11.591 --> 00:56:16.591
and it's usually a story about a small hand full of people who somehow know each

886
00:56:17.031 --> 00:56:21.790
other and then make this great company.
And when,
uh,
and,

887
00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:25.180
and,
and when you read about,
oh,
how do you start a startup?
It's it,

888
00:56:25.290 --> 00:56:27.250
it always skips.
That step is always like,

889
00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:31.210
you have your team and now I make your startup here,
here,
here's the steps.

890
00:56:31.211 --> 00:56:34.390
How do you get how you get a capital for venture capital funding and all these

891
00:56:34.391 --> 00:56:35.224
other things?

892
00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:40.680
How do you go from having this network that you've cultivated to act,

893
00:56:41.321 --> 00:56:45.000
to having like a team to yeah.
That,
uh,
that,
um,

894
00:56:45.070 --> 00:56:50.070
you can use to actually take steps to start things like this?

895
00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:54.220
<v 0>Very good question.
I mean,
I'm only speaking as an observer here,</v>

896
00:56:54.221 --> 00:56:58.960
have the same history you're talking about,
but it seems like,
uh,

897
00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:03.710
the probably the first thought isn't accompany,

898
00:57:03.711 --> 00:57:07.930
but like is it a product?
Is it a thing we can make?
That's interesting.

899
00:57:08.410 --> 00:57:12.450
Uh,
if it's,
if it's engineers and technical people,
um,

900
00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:17.710
and money doesn't come into it for a while,
uh,
but it's more like,

901
00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:22.510
is this a good idea?
Is this something,
um,
you know,

902
00:57:22.570 --> 00:57:26.020
either interesting or groundbreaking or does something different with technology

903
00:57:26.021 --> 00:57:27.790
in some way?
Um,

904
00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:33.750
I mean most Google's pretty unusual in that most companies don't have sort of an

905
00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:40.200
early team of employees that is as cohesive for as long as has been the case at

906
00:57:40.271 --> 00:57:44.950
Google.
That's really rare I think.
And so typically it's more like,

907
00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:49.540
uh,
you know,
the Beatles where it's like,
it was stu best,

908
00:57:49.541 --> 00:57:53.290
but he died or I mean,
stew Sutcliff,
he died.
And then it was Pete best,

909
00:57:53.291 --> 00:57:56.650
but he didn't kind of work out and we didn't like him.
And so then it was Ringo.

910
00:57:56.651 --> 00:58:01.540
You know,
it was like when I read about companies starting,
it's often okay,

911
00:58:01.541 --> 00:58:02.620
this was the beginning.

912
00:58:02.621 --> 00:58:06.490
And then in fact I just met a guy who said I was part of a startup.

913
00:58:06.491 --> 00:58:09.430
It was successful,
but I realized I didn't want to do it.
So I bailed.

914
00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:13.600
I sold my half to the other ones that I'm out.
People shift around.

915
00:58:13.630 --> 00:58:17.740
But essentially it does come from either we have a good idea cause we've been

916
00:58:17.741 --> 00:58:19.360
fooling around together and come up with something.

917
00:58:19.361 --> 00:58:24.361
Or in a lot of cases now it's like we worked somewhere on something before,

918
00:58:24.671 --> 00:58:29.140
but we always had this thing we talked about as a thing we'd like to try.

919
00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:33.730
But there are so many steps between that and you know,

920
00:58:34.270 --> 00:58:38.400
even these VC or anything but did becoming a company and we had lots,

921
00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:43.300
um,
you know,
don't obviously get that far.
But it is interesting.

922
00:58:43.301 --> 00:58:47.740
What you're saying though about it is kind of your personal network of people

923
00:58:47.741 --> 00:58:51.880
you know.
Well at first,
right.
Not,
it's not,
you're not,

924
00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:53.433
you know,

925
00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:57.490
discovering people on Instagram for your company or it's people you know,
and,

926
00:58:57.660 --> 00:59:01.780
and trust in the beginning and,
you know,
uh,
think deeply about stuff.

927
00:59:02.290 --> 00:59:06.220
Um,
and then,
you know,
it's a long,

928
00:59:06.250 --> 00:59:11.140
long journey after that,
I think.
And so how that happens,
I mean,

929
00:59:11.170 --> 00:59:13.320
we're lucky to live in a place and,

930
00:59:13.370 --> 00:59:18.370
and in a time when there's so many things that are like incubators and,

931
00:59:19.690 --> 00:59:20.321
you know,

932
00:59:20.321 --> 00:59:25.321
Angel Investors and small accelerators and things that are from very early stage

933
00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:31.510
just fooling around,
you know,
startups that are,
uh,

934
00:59:31.730 --> 00:59:35.810
not formulated at all,
but it's a few people trying to figure something out.

935
00:59:36.110 --> 00:59:37.040
And by the way,

936
00:59:37.041 --> 00:59:40.040
they're networking and talking to other people and testing out their ideas.

937
00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:44.750
So it's very hit and miss.
But,
um,
I think that's what,

938
00:59:45.350 --> 00:59:49.610
I dunno,
makes it seem so using a small conversation that turns into an idea.

939
00:59:50.030 --> 00:59:54.080
Yeah.
It's a good way of saying it.
It's great to be here.
