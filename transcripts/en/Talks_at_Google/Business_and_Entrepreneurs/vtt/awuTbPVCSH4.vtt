1
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:15.813
Yeah.

2
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.930
<v 2>Cool.
So let's start with,
uh,
your blog and your podcast.
Um,</v>

3
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.520
you call it afford anything.
Where did that name come from?

4
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.550
<v 0>So the concept of afford anything is really the concept of opportunity cost.</v>

5
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.230
It's this notion that you can afford anything but not everything.

6
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.320
And every decision that you make is a trade off against something else.

7
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.510
And this concept doesn't just apply to your money.
Um,

8
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.100
even though the word afford conjures up images of money immediately,

9
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.000
it also applies to your time at your focus,
your energy,

10
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.240
your attention.
Um,
because we all have limited cognition,

11
00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:52.260
limited mental bandwidth.

12
00:00:52.261 --> 00:00:57.261
So really it's this notion of recognizing that most of the resources that you

13
00:00:58.771 --> 00:01:00.390
deal with on a day to day basis,

14
00:01:00.391 --> 00:01:05.250
our limited resources and we need to be extremely conscious.

15
00:01:05.251 --> 00:01:09.410
I would say even ruthless about how we allocate them.
Um,

16
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.630
and that means number one,
allocating our resources with more intention.

17
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.910
And number two,
um,
deeply reflecting on how,
uh,
at at a,

18
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.740
at a 30,000 foot level,

19
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.160
what is actually a priority to us in our lives to each individual.

20
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.120
Uh,
not what does society say ought to be or what are the default priorities that

21
00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:30.954
we've been taught.

22
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.680
<v 2>Very nice.
And uh,
your best known,
you know,</v>

23
00:01:34.681 --> 00:01:38.010
kind of in the personal finance community for talking and writing a lot about

24
00:01:38.011 --> 00:01:39.030
financial independence.

25
00:01:39.031 --> 00:01:42.420
So what is financial independence and how does it relate to your story?

26
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.341
<v 0>Okay,</v>

27
00:01:43.341 --> 00:01:47.960
so financial independence is an interesting concept and it's one that's gained a

28
00:01:47.961 --> 00:01:49.760
lot of popularity in the past few years.

29
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.200
I define financial independence as the point at which your passive income

30
00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.780
typically but not always through investments is enough.

31
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.050
And when I say enough,

32
00:02:03.051 --> 00:02:07.700
I mean that it's enough that it creates at least some type of a safety net

33
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.361
underneath you,

34
00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:13.361
some type of a floor or a foundation such that you know that in a worst case

35
00:02:14.061 --> 00:02:18.500
scenario,
in a,
in a,
in a black swan situation,
you would be okay.
Um,

36
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.130
and so let's unpack that a little bit because there's a lot going on in that

37
00:02:22.131 --> 00:02:24.800
concept now.
First of all,
uh,

38
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.970
so financial independence is the point at which your passive income typically

39
00:02:28.971 --> 00:02:30.860
through investment.
So what do,
what do we mean by that?

40
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.250
So passive income is income that does not come through exchanging time for money

41
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.700
directly.
So for example,

42
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.870
if you have access to a four o one k and you make contributions,
uh,

43
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.840
of your income into your four one k,

44
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.410
that money will hopefully grow,
right?

45
00:02:51.411 --> 00:02:55.790
That money will grow both through capital gains and through dividends and then

46
00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.010
those growth,
that growth will compound.

47
00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.380
So that would be an of passive income regardless of whether or not you harness

48
00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:03.190
it,
right,

49
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.190
it's income in the sense that it fuels your net worth and it makes your balance

50
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:12.880
sheet bigger,
your personal balance sheet bigger,

51
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.100
regardless of the fact that you are not actively pulling money out of your 401k

52
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.400
on Tuesday in order to pay for a pair of shoes.
Um,

53
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.440
it's still yours,
right?

54
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.420
Same thing with if you make contributions to an IRA or to a health savings

55
00:03:28.421 --> 00:03:33.421
account or if you use that money to buy a personal residence or a rental

56
00:03:34.421 --> 00:03:35.740
property,
um,

57
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.640
if assuming that those appreciate or if the rental property does well in all of

58
00:03:39.641 --> 00:03:40.474
those examples,

59
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.590
you have a source of passive income coming in that's fueling your net worth

60
00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:49.540
despite,
uh,
despite the fact that you're not actively trading dollars for it.
Now,

61
00:03:49.541 --> 00:03:50.890
when we talk about the,

62
00:03:50.891 --> 00:03:54.700
so the last portion of the definition of financial independence is this concept

63
00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:59.590
of enough and that leads to a fairly big philosophical question,

64
00:03:59.591 --> 00:04:04.460
which is how much is enough?
Uh,
and at the,

65
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.340
this is a source of endless debate within the,

66
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.010
the financial independence community,
which is abbreviated as the fi community.

67
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.400
But,
uh,

68
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.830
the add a bare bones basic level enough is as I see it,

69
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.630
uh,
enough such that in a worst case scenario,

70
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.260
you would at least be okay.
You could feed yourself,
you could keep,

71
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.380
you can keep the lights on.

72
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.520
You could have some type of a reasonable human shelter.

73
00:04:36.521 --> 00:04:40.490
It might not be what you prefer,
but you know that you would be okay.
Um,

74
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.830
and the example that I often like to use is,
so a lot of people,

75
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:46.373
um,

76
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.900
conflate financial independence with a extreme wealth or big other high Falutin

77
00:04:55.421 --> 00:04:57.490
pie in the sky ideas.
Um,

78
00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.340
the example that I like to give to kind of bring it down to Earth a little bit

79
00:05:00.341 --> 00:05:05.341
is let's say that you had a brother or a sister and two d today.

80
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.750
In an hour from now you get a phone call and you find out that your sibling,
uh,

81
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.780
just got diagnosed with a terminal illness and they have one year left to live.

82
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.780
Um,

83
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.780
and you want nothing more than to take a one year leave of absence,

84
00:05:22.031 --> 00:05:26.950
unpaid leave of absence from work so that you can spend that last year or that

85
00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:28.810
last six months with your sibling.

86
00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.310
And you can't do that locally because your sibling lives on the other side of

87
00:05:33.311 --> 00:05:37.810
the country or they live in a different country,
right?
So,
so you need that time.

88
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.650
Uh,

89
00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.650
financial independence is the state of having enough passive income so that when

90
00:05:45.311 --> 00:05:46.031
you're doing that,

91
00:05:46.031 --> 00:05:50.460
when you drop everything to be with your sibling for those critical moments,
uh,

92
00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.730
you'll be okay.
You know,
you're not going to be going to Disneyland.

93
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.940
You're not going to be,
uh,
having $400 steak dinners,

94
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.310
but you'll at least be okay.
Um,

95
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.440
and there's a lot of freedom that comes with that.

96
00:06:03.441 --> 00:06:06.010
A lot of people who reach financial independence and,

97
00:06:06.011 --> 00:06:08.870
and I reached it when I was 31,
we'll talk about that in a minute.

98
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:14.230
But a lot of people who reach financial independence often find that nothing in

99
00:06:14.781 --> 00:06:17.660
their life necessarily changes.
Uh,
they're,

100
00:06:17.661 --> 00:06:22.661
the day to day of their life might look exactly the same post Ffi as it did pre

101
00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:25.503
CFI.

102
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:30.730
But the psychological relief that comes from knowing that you have your own,

103
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:35.600
you've built your own safety net,
um,
is valuable.

104
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:40.630
And so sometimes I joke the FII is an extremely elaborate anxiety reduction

105
00:06:40.911 --> 00:06:45.800
measure.
So in my own life,
um,

106
00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:50.390
so my own story is I graduated from college when I was,
uh,

107
00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:54.530
the 21.
This was in 2005 and I,

108
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.500
shortly after a few months after that,
I caught it,
my first,

109
00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:02.600
first job at a newspaper and my starting salary was 21,000 a year.
Um,

110
00:07:02.601 --> 00:07:07.601
and I worked at that job until 2008 and a time that I left my salary was 31,000

111
00:07:08.271 --> 00:07:08.961
a year.
By the way.

112
00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:12.680
I know it's unusual to like sit on stage with a microphone revealing your
salary,

113
00:07:12.681 --> 00:07:16.340
but,
um,
I'm,
I'm a blogger and podcaster and I've made this very,

114
00:07:16.341 --> 00:07:21.080
very public for years,
so I'm comfortable sharing all these numbers.
Uh,

115
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:24.170
so at the time that I left my job,
which was in 2008,

116
00:07:24.171 --> 00:07:27.530
I was making 31 a year and I,
um,

117
00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:32.930
I had a lot of anxiety at that time.
Like I,
you know,
being in my early twenties,

118
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:38.060
I could live like a college students though it was fine,
but I knew that,

119
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:43.070
um,
that later in my life I was going to need something more,

120
00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:44.510
something bigger,
something better,

121
00:07:44.511 --> 00:07:49.460
especially if I ever want it to have a family or ever wanted to own a home or

122
00:07:49.461 --> 00:07:52.970
anything like that.
And so,
uh,

123
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:59.200
so I became really obsessed with saving and obsessed with investing.

124
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:03.410
Um,
I started making money while I was still in newspaper.

125
00:08:03.411 --> 00:08:05.500
I was making money on the side as a,

126
00:08:05.501 --> 00:08:10.130
as a freelancer and I continue to grow that and I became just extremely

127
00:08:10.131 --> 00:08:11.660
aggressive about saving and investing,

128
00:08:11.661 --> 00:08:16.220
largely fueled by honestly fear,
um,

129
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.840
which,
you know,
uh,
I wanted to make sure that I would be okay.

130
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:25.310
And so over the course of the next,

131
00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:29.480
basically throughout the rest of my twenties and into my early thirties,

132
00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.160
myself and also my husband at the time,

133
00:08:34.161 --> 00:08:36.020
soon to be ex husband will,

134
00:08:36.021 --> 00:08:40.410
who shares my same like enthusiasm for saving and investing.
Um,

135
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:45.520
we lived on oftentimes about 50% of our combined income and invested the rest of

136
00:08:46.791 --> 00:08:51.290
it.
And we invested in a combination of,
um,
401k.

137
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:55.560
I have a Roth solar 401k.
He has a simple IRA.
Uh,

138
00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:59.340
we both had Roth Iras,
which later turned to backdoor Roth Iras.

139
00:08:59.341 --> 00:09:03.960
We had an HSA accounts.
We had the whole alphabet soup going on.
And uh,

140
00:09:03.961 --> 00:09:05.700
so we put a lot of money there,

141
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:09.930
but then we put a lot of money into a rental properties as well.

142
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:13.560
We lived with roommates until we were 31 and our,
I mean,

143
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:18.690
our net worth at the time that we stopped living with roommates are combined.

144
00:09:18.691 --> 00:09:20.700
Net worth was over $1 million at the time.

145
00:09:20.701 --> 00:09:25.110
So we were millionaires living with roommates so that we can save 50% of our

146
00:09:25.111 --> 00:09:28.890
income and just shovel that into investments.
Um,

147
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:32.820
and that was the level of our dedication towards investing.

148
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.290
So that would,

149
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:39.320
that was how I reached Fyi over a million dollars

150
00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:43.690
<v 2>in financial independent by 31.
Which brings us to a very important question.</v>

151
00:09:43.691 --> 00:09:48.490
Please share with us your investing philosophy and some tactics and strategies

152
00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:49.503
that you use.

153
00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:54.580
<v 0>I'm at a high level.
My investing philosophy is,
uh,</v>

154
00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:59.820
is one that is very fond of passively managed investments.

155
00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.660
So,
uh,
there is this,
uh,

156
00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:07.750
there's this thing called index funds that was created by John Bogle who's the

157
00:10:07.751 --> 00:10:08.680
founder of vanguard.

158
00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:14.140
And an index fund is a fund that tracks a market,

159
00:10:14.141 --> 00:10:17.110
a broad market index.
So for example,

160
00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:22.320
an index fund might track the s and p 500 index and when you invest in an index

161
00:10:23.441 --> 00:10:24.274
fund,

162
00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:29.310
that fund at attempts to the best of its ability to mirror everything in that

163
00:10:31.031 --> 00:10:31.481
index.

164
00:10:31.481 --> 00:10:36.481
And that means that it will do as well as or as poorly as what it's tracking.

165
00:10:38.141 --> 00:10:41.140
So if you invest in the total us stock market index,

166
00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:46.440
you will do as well as or as poorly as the total us stock market,

167
00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.210
no better and no worse.

168
00:10:49.211 --> 00:10:53.650
And what they found is that statistically speaking over the longterm,

169
00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:57.790
over about a 15 to 30 year timespan,

170
00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.680
you are statistically speaking low,

171
00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:05.560
more likely to do better trying to match the market.

172
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:08.080
Then you are trying to outperform the market.

173
00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:13.750
You will sometimes occasionally in the short run have funds or fund managers

174
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:16.030
that momentarily outperform.

175
00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:20.890
But then they tend to over time revert to the mean.

176
00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:25.330
So you're better off just taking the passive approach.

177
00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:29.700
And uh,
and similarly with real estate investments,
um,

178
00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:33.190
I'm a big fan of rental properties and with rental properties as well.

179
00:11:33.191 --> 00:11:36.880
I favor a passive approach of,
you know,

180
00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:41.500
don't try to constantly be flipping home in my view.
Um,
there are other people,

181
00:11:41.501 --> 00:11:43.810
of course we do it differently than me,
but,
um,

182
00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:46.960
I don't want to be spending all of my time trying to flip homes,

183
00:11:46.961 --> 00:11:50.800
are trying to go and do extremely sophisticated tactics because that's not what

184
00:11:50.801 --> 00:11:51.820
I do full time.

185
00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:57.100
I have a different time job and I want to focus on that other full time work

186
00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:59.710
because that's my core competence.

187
00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:05.010
And so I want to make my real estate investments as passive as possible so that

188
00:12:05.051 --> 00:12:09.220
they take up as little of my cognition as possible.
Again,

189
00:12:09.221 --> 00:12:11.050
because you can do anything but not everything.

190
00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.910
<v 2>Right.
And you write and talk a lot about growing the gap.</v>

191
00:12:14.911 --> 00:12:16.410
So what do you mean by growing the gap?

192
00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:21.920
<v 0>It's the growing,
the gap is,
uh,
the result of a big,
um,</v>

193
00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:22.701
an argument,

194
00:12:22.701 --> 00:12:26.810
a debate that is popular among people in the personal finance community and in

195
00:12:26.811 --> 00:12:27.800
the Fei community,

196
00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:33.130
which people love to argue about whether it is more efficient to earn more or

197
00:12:33.981 --> 00:12:34.940
spend less.

198
00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:40.060
It's that classic like chocolate versus vanilla peanut butter versus Jelly

199
00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:43.850
debate,
right?
And so,
um,

200
00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:49.610
and people often tend to the,
they'll choose a side,
they'll,
they'll pick a camp.

201
00:12:49.611 --> 00:12:53.090
It's almost like you have a favorite sports team.
I'm on the earn more side.
Well,

202
00:12:53.091 --> 00:12:55.060
I'm on the save more side.
Uh,

203
00:12:55.070 --> 00:13:00.070
and the way that I was able to find a bit of compromise between those two is I

204
00:13:00.621 --> 00:13:03.860
asked myself,
what are we actually trying to do here?
Like,

205
00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.650
forget what camp you're in.
What's the goal?

206
00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:11.720
The objective is to increase the gap between what you make and what you spend.

207
00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:18.620
And when you think of it in though,
in that terms,

208
00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:19.311
you know,

209
00:13:19.311 --> 00:13:24.020
growing the gap is the objective becomes more clear,

210
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:28.370
right?
You're not caught up in,
uh,
endless penny pinching.

211
00:13:28.371 --> 00:13:32.990
You're not caught up in like,
uh,
trying to shrink your way to greatness,

212
00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:38.210
nor on the other side.
Are you caught up in just try,

213
00:13:38.211 --> 00:13:38.720
you know,

214
00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:42.260
going for promotion after promotion and raise after Ray's trying to make as much

215
00:13:42.261 --> 00:13:46.520
money as possible,
but being super careless about your spending,

216
00:13:46.521 --> 00:13:47.900
like growing the gap is,

217
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:53.000
is that that recognition that you can earn more,

218
00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.520
you can spend less,
you can do a combination of both,

219
00:13:55.700 --> 00:14:00.700
but ultimately your approach or your tactic matters less than the size of the

220
00:14:01.461 --> 00:14:02.294
gap.

221
00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:06.920
<v 2>So on the savings side,
there's a cliche that says,
you know,
uh,</v>

222
00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:11.720
don't buy lattes or set another way.
Don't pay $5 for a cup of coffee.
Do you,
uh,

223
00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:12.583
do you agree with that?

224
00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:16.510
<v 0>So that was coined by David Bach,
uh,
and David Bark is,</v>

225
00:14:16.511 --> 00:14:21.511
he's a bestselling author and he very much meant that as a metaphor for don't be

226
00:14:22.631 --> 00:14:27.631
mindless about your spending the $5 a day,

227
00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:30.670
you know,
the buying a latte.

228
00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:36.430
If it is done with intention,
if you sit down and you think,
you know,

229
00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:37.780
I really value this,

230
00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:42.810
I value this moment in my morning where I can drink a latte and write in my

231
00:14:44.141 --> 00:14:46.900
journal and reflect on what's coming up in my day.

232
00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.360
That conscious,

233
00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:54.390
intentional spending is very different than mindlessly buying a $5 coffee every

234
00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:01.670
morning and then at the end of the week complaining that you don't have enough

235
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:05.440
or wondering why you're still in credit card debt.
Those are,
you know,

236
00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:09.170
same action.
But the thought behind it is the differentiator.

237
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:13.250
That being said,
in the world of saving money,

238
00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:17.960
there's what I call the big three housing,
transportation,
food.

239
00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:21.740
And if you can get those,
those big three right,

240
00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.580
then you can actually make a,
a lot of small,

241
00:15:25.581 --> 00:15:29.840
you can get a lot of small things wrong if you get those three things right

242
00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.390
because for the average American housing,

243
00:15:32.391 --> 00:15:36.590
transportation and food are going to be your three biggest expenses.

244
00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:42.310
<v 2>And,
and actually just to follow up on that,
um,
same,
same concept of like,</v>

245
00:15:42.311 --> 00:15:47.110
how do you think about making budgeting and budgeting and spending decisions,

246
00:15:47.111 --> 00:15:51.220
especially for a,
in a certain category.
So it's,
it to come up with a budget.

247
00:15:51.221 --> 00:15:53.350
How do you decide for these categories?

248
00:15:53.351 --> 00:15:56.890
And all of my budget's going to be $50 or $100 or $200 a month.

249
00:15:56.891 --> 00:15:58.960
It is it arbitrary.
And then also like,

250
00:15:58.961 --> 00:16:02.030
how do I decide how much to spend versus how much to invest?
You know,

251
00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:05.440
if I have x amount of dollars,
you know,
um,
from my paycheck,

252
00:16:05.441 --> 00:16:07.360
how do I decide where to allocate that money?

253
00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:08.060
<v 0>Hmm.</v>

254
00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:11.750
So it's interesting that you ask about different categories because I'm going to

255
00:16:11.751 --> 00:16:14.720
take a step back for a second and question the premise.

256
00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:20.260
What is the point of allocating your budget into specific granular line up line

257
00:16:21.831 --> 00:16:24.950
itemized categories,
right?
At ultimately,

258
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:30.670
a budget is a tool that people use in order to make sure that you are saving

259
00:16:31.161 --> 00:16:35.090
enough.
So again,
let's take that step back and say,
ask,

260
00:16:35.091 --> 00:16:36.290
what's the objective here?

261
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:38.780
If the objective is to make sure that you're saving enough,

262
00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:43.960
well let's start with that.
So,
so you take whatever your,

263
00:16:43.961 --> 00:16:48.230
your take home income is,
your,
your after tax income.
Um,

264
00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:52.970
and from that,
decide how much you want to save.

265
00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:55.760
And when I say safe,
I mean that very broadly.

266
00:16:55.761 --> 00:16:58.490
I mean that is anything that improves your net worth.

267
00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:03.650
So how much money do you want to put into retirement accounts?
Uh,

268
00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:06.470
use as additional payments on a debt,

269
00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:10.130
so it maybe additional payments towards a student loan or a mortgage.

270
00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:15.020
And then savings could also be literal savings in a savings account,
right?
So,

271
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:19.100
um,
take your income then ask yourself,

272
00:17:19.101 --> 00:17:22.730
how much of this do I want to save?
Meaning any improvement to my net worth,

273
00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:28.330
Yank that off the top and then whatever is left over is yours to spend.

274
00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:33.110
And there isn't actually any reason that to,
uh,

275
00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:37.940
two line itemize it any further than that.
Now,
if you want to,

276
00:17:37.941 --> 00:17:42.941
if you're the the personality type who loves tinkering with spreadsheets and,

277
00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:48.410
uh,
that sounds like a really fun way to spend a Friday night,
then go for it.

278
00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:52.320
You know,
if that's what you want to do.
But to a lot of people,

279
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:57.300
a lot of people believe that they can't stick to a budget because they create

280
00:17:57.301 --> 00:18:02.301
these incredibly granular budgets where they've allocated precisely $37 a month

281
00:18:03.001 --> 00:18:03.990
for dog food.

282
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:08.640
And then it turns out that they've spent $42 that month and then they throw up

283
00:18:08.641 --> 00:18:12.240
their hands and despair and decide that budgeting is not for me and I'm just not

284
00:18:12.241 --> 00:18:15.000
very good at money.
Right?
And so the,

285
00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:19.680
the concept of what I call the anti budget,
which is what I've just described,

286
00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:24.780
which is this very simple two category budget of Save,
spend,

287
00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:30.030
the anti budget,
uh,
was something that I developed in order to address that,

288
00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:34.020
that,
that concern that a lot of people had that problem that a lot of people had

289
00:18:34.021 --> 00:18:36.660
because so many people were giving up on the notion of budgeting.

290
00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:39.600
I'm thinking that it had to be more complicated than it is

291
00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:45.480
for people.
They do want to increase their savings rate as you're talking about.

292
00:18:45.481 --> 00:18:49.920
What are some ways to go about doing that?
Ooh.
So again,

293
00:18:49.921 --> 00:18:54.921
if you think of savings more broadly as growing the gap,

294
00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:58.680
then you can earn more.
You can spend less,

295
00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:02.190
you can do a combination of both.
So let's talk about each of those.

296
00:19:02.191 --> 00:19:06.130
So earning more,
um,
you can do that and depending,

297
00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:09.720
it depends on really where you are in life,

298
00:19:09.721 --> 00:19:13.700
like what your life situation is for some people,
like if,

299
00:19:13.701 --> 00:19:16.470
if you have the opportunity,

300
00:19:16.471 --> 00:19:20.310
if you are at a company that is large enough to have the opportunity for

301
00:19:20.311 --> 00:19:22.920
promotions and raises,
um,

302
00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:27.100
then hitting it really hard at work and uh,

303
00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:32.180
making yourself extremely valuable to your company so that you are company

304
00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:34.560
reciprocates with you,

305
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:38.910
bringing rewarding you with some of that value that you're giving to them.
Um,

306
00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:43.970
that can be an incredibly powerful way to save because if you keep your current

307
00:19:44.821 --> 00:19:49.710
standard of living exactly where it is and then you earn more,

308
00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:52.380
you get raises,
you get promotions,
you earn more,

309
00:19:52.381 --> 00:19:54.300
and then you bank all of those raises.

310
00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:59.480
So you just keep living exactly where you are today and save every single res

311
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:02.730
that over the span of 10 years,

312
00:20:02.731 --> 00:20:06.360
assuming that you continue to get raises and promotions over the next 10 years,

313
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:11.400
that alone can be just rocket fuel on your finances.
Um,

314
00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:16.110
of course that assumes that you are at a company that has those types of

315
00:20:16.111 --> 00:20:19.650
opportunities.
Um,
if,
uh,
you know,

316
00:20:19.651 --> 00:20:24.070
in my case I worked at a very small newspaper where like I said,
my,

317
00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:28.440
my maximum salary was 31,000 and the person at that company,

318
00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:31.560
the highest paid person at that company was making about 60.
You know,

319
00:20:31.561 --> 00:20:36.150
it was a just a small company that didn't have those types of opportunities for

320
00:20:36.151 --> 00:20:39.410
advancement or at least those opportunities for,
um,
I,

321
00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:42.420
I didn't have the opportunity for a six figure income where,
where I worked.

322
00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:46.290
And so,
uh,
in that situation,
uh,

323
00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:49.750
developing some type of a side hustle or a side business,

324
00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:52.390
it could be a good approach.

325
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:57.600
And I'll divide that actually into two different levels because in terms of side

326
00:20:57.701 --> 00:21:00.880
businesses,
you have the Gig economy stuff,
right?

327
00:21:00.881 --> 00:21:05.260
You have driving for Uber,
driving for Lyft,
renting out a room on Airbnb,

328
00:21:05.261 --> 00:21:08.950
walking dogs on rover,
I'm renting out your car on Turo.

329
00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:13.360
Those are all gig economy types of ways to make some extra income.

330
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:18.580
The benefit is that that income is immediate,
but the drawback is that you can't,

331
00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:22.030
um,
in,
uh,
well with,
with the exception of Airbnb,

332
00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:26.380
you can't really distinguish yourself very much.

333
00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:28.240
You don't have much of a competitive advantage.

334
00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:32.980
And so while you have some immediate income,
you might not,

335
00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.590
your upside potential will be limited.

336
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:40.000
The other type of side income would be something like freelancing consulting,

337
00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:45.180
something where you have unique value that is your market differentiator.

338
00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:49.780
And so the advantage to that type of side income is that you can potentially

339
00:21:49.781 --> 00:21:50.650
make a lot more.

340
00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:54.550
The disadvantage is that that can take a while to build and to scale.

341
00:21:54.551 --> 00:21:58.800
So that income's not necessarily going to be immediate.
So

342
00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:05.260
another thing you say is never delay gratification.
What does that mean?

343
00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:08.410
So that very much applies to the,

344
00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:12.820
the thinking or the mental construct around,
uh,

345
00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:14.710
saving money and investing money.

346
00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:19.840
A lot of people I refer to saving money as delayed gratification.

347
00:22:19.841 --> 00:22:23.440
And I think that that's a huge mistake,
especially because,
you know,

348
00:22:23.441 --> 00:22:27.970
you're trying to encourage people in their twenties and thirties,
um,
to,
to save,

349
00:22:27.971 --> 00:22:31.150
especially to safer retirement because the longer your money is,

350
00:22:31.151 --> 00:22:35.830
the time in the market is far more important than timing in the market.
And,

351
00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:41.140
um,
compounding growth is the,
you know,
a wonder of the universe,
right?

352
00:22:41.141 --> 00:22:42.570
So,
uh,

353
00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:47.730
when you tell someone in their team in their twenties to delay gratification,

354
00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:53.890
that sounds pretty awful.
But if you reframe that mental concept,

355
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:58.330
and if you say,
you know what,
I'm not delaying gratification.

356
00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:03.850
I am super gratified by watching my net worth grow.

357
00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:08.230
Like I am super gratified by looking at these,

358
00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:13.000
the numbers in this account and watching them get bigger and tracking my net

359
00:23:13.001 --> 00:23:17.560
worth and watching that line go up.
Uh,
that's super cool.

360
00:23:17.561 --> 00:23:22.561
And that brings me far more of a sense of satisfaction than some cheap plastic

361
00:23:23.501 --> 00:23:28.501
junk or a car that is marginally nicer than the one that I already have.

362
00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:34.180
Right?
Like that's a way that you can reframe gratification rather than delay it.

363
00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:35.320
Uh,

364
00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:40.320
the other aspect of that is to have a very strong why that motivates you.

365
00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:45.750
So you don't want to be unhappy in the present for the sake of a future.

366
00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:51.170
You want a,
you do want a future that you look forward to.

367
00:23:51.171 --> 00:23:55.430
You want a strong compelling,
like why in the future,

368
00:23:55.431 --> 00:24:00.431
but you also want to frame that saving and investing in a way in which you're

369
00:24:00.591 --> 00:24:03.650
enjoying the present moment.
So for example,
when I lived with roommates,

370
00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:07.340
like my thinking at the time,
my mentality was like,
cool,

371
00:24:07.341 --> 00:24:09.680
I've got built in friends,
you know,

372
00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:12.800
I've always got people to eat dinner with and you know,

373
00:24:12.801 --> 00:24:17.690
so there were of course certain drawbacks with that,
like sharing a refrigerator.

374
00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:19.160
Um,

375
00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:24.160
but I focused mentally focused on the advantages rather than the disadvantages.

376
00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:30.730
And that made it feel like have a fun immediately fun option rather than as a

377
00:24:32.421 --> 00:24:33.290
sacrifice.

378
00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:37.380
<v 2>Um,
yeah,
we talked about kind of saving and investing.</v>

379
00:24:37.381 --> 00:24:41.490
How about investing versus paying off debt?
So,
um,
you know,

380
00:24:41.491 --> 00:24:42.660
most people have some sort of debt,

381
00:24:42.661 --> 00:24:46.710
whether it's a mortgage or student loans or whatnot.
And,
um,

382
00:24:46.711 --> 00:24:50.430
how do you think about whether if you do have some extra cash to pay down debt

383
00:24:50.431 --> 00:24:51.930
quicker,
or should I invest,

384
00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:54.870
do the minimum payment and then invest that in the stock market?

385
00:24:54.871 --> 00:24:57.420
And it seems to be arguments both ways.
What are your thoughts on that?

386
00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:59.460
<v 0>That's an excellent question.
Now.
First of all,</v>

387
00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:01.560
both of them are fantastic options.

388
00:25:01.561 --> 00:25:06.540
Anything that improves your net worth is awesome.
So,

389
00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:11.220
uh,
regardless of which one you choose,
that's either way.

390
00:25:11.221 --> 00:25:14.390
It's great in terms of how to think through that question.
There are,

391
00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:17.670
there are a couple of different approaches.
First of all,

392
00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:21.360
I'm going to differentiate between high interest debt versus low interest debt.

393
00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:25.920
Now we know that historically the u s stock market,

394
00:25:25.921 --> 00:25:29.700
depending on the years that you're looking at the timeframe that you're looking

395
00:25:29.701 --> 00:25:30.780
at,
historically,

396
00:25:30.781 --> 00:25:35.781
the US stock market has returned somewhere between seven to 10% ish.

397
00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:38.940
Uh,
as a long term aggregate average.

398
00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:44.070
Warren Buffett has predicted that the US stock market might mean to the extent

399
00:25:44.071 --> 00:25:47.280
that anybody can ever predict anything about the future,
um,

400
00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:52.440
has predicted that the u s stock market may produce 7% returns in the future

401
00:25:52.891 --> 00:25:57.480
moving forward.
The,
of course projection is just a fancy word for guests,

402
00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:01.230
but we can use that as a ballpark figure as we're kind of thinking through this

403
00:26:01.231 --> 00:26:05.850
decision.
So if you have a debt that has double digit interest rates,
right?

404
00:26:05.851 --> 00:26:09.420
If you've got a debt that's 10,
10,
or more percent,
or I would,

405
00:26:09.421 --> 00:26:13.290
I would argue personally,
8% or more,
um,

406
00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:18.680
pay that off because your not likely to do better in a,

407
00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:24.300
uh,
in an index fund,
in a broad market index fund.
Now,

408
00:26:24.301 --> 00:26:29.301
if you have a debt that has a high single digit will say somewhere between five

409
00:26:29.911 --> 00:26:32.370
to 8% interest rate,
um,

410
00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:35.580
there's still a strong argument for paying that debt off,

411
00:26:35.581 --> 00:26:37.320
although the argument is a little bit less strong.

412
00:26:37.321 --> 00:26:41.170
But when you talk about investment returns,
you want to think of them in the,

413
00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:45.120
in the framework of a risk adjusted return.

414
00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:50.420
And what that means is that getting a return of 8% in a treasury bond is very

415
00:26:53.161 --> 00:26:57.450
different than getting a return of 8% in Bitcoin,
right?

416
00:26:57.450 --> 00:27:02.010
Like two totally different types of risks that we're talking about.

417
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:07.310
So if you're thinking about arbitraging the difference between the interest rate

418
00:27:08.431 --> 00:27:12.780
that you're paying on a loan versus the return that you could get,
uh,

419
00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:15.810
in an investment,
you want the,

420
00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:19.720
the potential gap that to be big enough,

421
00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:23.640
you want that spread to be big enough to justify the added risk.
So for example,

422
00:27:23.641 --> 00:27:28.641
if you have a mortgage at a 3.5% interest rate and you have $10,000 that you got

423
00:27:33.031 --> 00:27:35.340
as as a bonus and you're wondering,

424
00:27:35.341 --> 00:27:40.341
should I apply this $10,000 towards my mortgage or should I put this $10,000

425
00:27:41.401 --> 00:27:46.401
into the stock market while at that point we're talking about a spread that is

426
00:27:49.381 --> 00:27:54.300
large enough that there would be in many cases that have pretty valid argument

427
00:27:54.301 --> 00:27:57.510
for putting that 10 grand into the market.
Um,

428
00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:02.430
if the spread is really small,
then it's not,
you know,

429
00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:07.260
it's just not worth it.
So that being said,
the other,

430
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:11.790
the other thing that I'll say is that there are many people who are proponents

431
00:28:11.791 --> 00:28:14.550
of getting rid of debt as quickly as possible.
Um,

432
00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:19.500
because there are a lot of emotional and psychological benefits to getting rid

433
00:28:19.501 --> 00:28:22.890
of that debt.
And so in addition to the math of it,

434
00:28:22.891 --> 00:28:27.810
in addition to the opportunity cost and the expected value,
um,

435
00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:32.940
you also do want to think about,
you know,
we're not machines,
we're not robots.

436
00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:38.070
And if that psychological benefit to being debt free is going to help you get a

437
00:28:38.071 --> 00:28:41.580
better night's sleep,
we'll then there's added value in that.

438
00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:45.310
<v 2>Yeah.
So you've obviously made a very compelling argument,</v>

439
00:28:45.311 --> 00:28:48.880
like why you should invest their seasons,
investors in the room.

440
00:28:48.881 --> 00:28:52.630
And there's also people just getting started and,
and,
um,

441
00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:56.410
I guess one challenge that I still have is trying to figure out my ideal asset

442
00:28:56.411 --> 00:29:00.430
allocation.
Um,
everyone disagrees with it.
You know,
some people would say,

443
00:29:00.431 --> 00:29:02.380
you're very young,
you should be all stocks.

444
00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:04.930
Some people will say you should have your age in bonds.

445
00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:07.580
Some people should say the market's been very volatile.

446
00:29:07.581 --> 00:29:11.770
He should have real estate in your portfolio and others would say cash is king.

447
00:29:11.771 --> 00:29:15.910
So with so many different asset classes,
how do you make a decision on how,

448
00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:16.211
you know,

449
00:29:16.211 --> 00:29:20.200
based on things like risk tolerance and how do you decide for you specifically

450
00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:21.640
rather than just some rule of thumb?

451
00:29:21.641 --> 00:29:25.270
Like how do I decide what my personal asset allocation should be?

452
00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:27.440
<v 0>Hmm,
that's a also a good question.</v>

453
00:29:27.441 --> 00:29:32.441
So when people diversify their investments,

454
00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:33.343
um,
the,

455
00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:38.650
the idea behind diversification is to have an assortment of what are known as

456
00:29:38.961 --> 00:29:41.000
low correlation assets.

457
00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:46.380
And so low correlation assets are assets in which when one moves this way,

458
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:50.740
the other doesn't move or it moves inverse inverse.

459
00:29:50.741 --> 00:29:53.230
So like stocks and bonds,
that's an easy example.

460
00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:57.850
They tend to have an inverse correlation with one another.
Um,
when one goes up,

461
00:29:57.851 --> 00:29:58.780
the other goes down.

462
00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:04.020
And so having that mix of stocks and bonds smooths out the ride in your

463
00:30:04.361 --> 00:30:08.020
portfolio.
And really what it does is if,
when you rebalance,

464
00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:13.350
the idea behind rebalancing is that you sell some of the winners and buy more of

465
00:30:13.931 --> 00:30:16.930
the losers.
You know,
you buy things that are underperforming,

466
00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:20.650
you sell things that are doing really well and buy more of what's

467
00:30:20.651 --> 00:30:21.490
underperforming.

468
00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:26.820
Rebalancing a portfolio forces you to,

469
00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:30.640
uh,
to do exactly that.
It forces you to sell the winter,

470
00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:35.200
harvest the winners and by the under performers.
And as,
as a result,

471
00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:40.230
the whole concept of rebalancing forces you to take a contrarian approach and

472
00:30:41.411 --> 00:30:43.990
move in the opposite direction of the market.

473
00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:47.950
It forces you to be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are

474
00:30:47.951 --> 00:30:52.570
greedy.
To paraphrase that famous quote.
And um,

475
00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:57.720
that's the reason why asset allocation and I'm buying an,

476
00:30:59.071 --> 00:30:59.200
uh,

477
00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:04.200
an assortment of like different assets and then rebalancing periodically is so

478
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:11.290
well regarded among many people.
That being said,

479
00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:14.200
it's not necessarily the only way to do it.

480
00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:17.920
There are plenty of people who make the argument that particularly when you're

481
00:31:17.921 --> 00:31:18.640
young,

482
00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:23.640
having an all equities portfolio with balanced out with a strong cash reserve

483
00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:28.660
would be better than putting a portion of your portfolio in bonds.

484
00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:33.230
Since historically over a 40 year time span,

485
00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:35.620
um,
those equities are going to do better.

486
00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:39.370
And so there are people who will argue that having any type of a bond allocation

487
00:31:39.371 --> 00:31:44.371
means that you are giving up some returns in exchange for that smoother ride.

488
00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:49.930
Um,
so if you talk to a hundred different people about asset allocation,

489
00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:52.390
you're going to hear 101 different responses.

490
00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:56.950
The way to think through it for yourself is first and foremost,
again,

491
00:31:57.310 --> 00:32:01.210
what's going to help you sleep more easily at night because,
uh,

492
00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:03.880
behave your behavior is,

493
00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:08.380
and your contributions are the single biggest determinant of market performance.

494
00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:13.560
They found that people often underperform the funds that they are in.

495
00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:17.500
And on the surface that sounds impossible.
Like if you're in a fund,

496
00:32:17.501 --> 00:32:22.440
how can you possibly underperform the fund that you're in?
But,
uh,

497
00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:26.320
the reason that that happens is because people get nervous and then they dance

498
00:32:26.321 --> 00:32:28.570
in and out of the fund.
And as a result,

499
00:32:28.571 --> 00:32:31.700
they underperform what they're already holding.
Um,

500
00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:36.910
and so they've actually found that dead people actually outperformed the living

501
00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:41.870
and when it comes to investment returns,
um,
because they just don't touch,

502
00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:46.490
they don't touch their portfolio.
Um,

503
00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:49.490
and so I actually,

504
00:32:49.491 --> 00:32:53.450
I learned that through Jl Collins who gave a great talk at Google.
Um,

505
00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:57.710
and so,
uh,
so that's the first question that I would ask yourself,
right?

506
00:32:57.740 --> 00:32:59.150
Like the math of it is one thing,

507
00:32:59.151 --> 00:33:02.480
but the behavioral component cannot be understated.

508
00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:07.840
So if having that bond allocation or having some portion of your portfolio in

509
00:33:08.271 --> 00:33:13.070
commodities or in real estate,
uh,
or you know,
in,

510
00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:18.100
or just keeping an excess in cash beyond what most financial advisors might

511
00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:23.660
recommend,
um,
if that's what helps you

512
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:29.780
hold steady through market declines and hold steady through or a session,

513
00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:32.690
then,
then it's worthwhile.

514
00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:38.400
<v 2>So,
speaking of Jl Collins and a other industry,
Titans like Warren Buffet,</v>

515
00:33:38.401 --> 00:33:41.730
Jack Bogle,
they all say us stocks,
you know,

516
00:33:41.731 --> 00:33:45.780
put your money and either the s and p 500 or the total us stock market and don't

517
00:33:45.781 --> 00:33:48.130
touch it for a really long time.
Um,

518
00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:52.350
what are your thoughts on us first international investing?
So should,

519
00:33:52.410 --> 00:33:55.440
should people be investing in international stocks?
So I guess,

520
00:33:55.441 --> 00:33:59.370
could you talk about kind of home country bias and then whether or not you

521
00:33:59.371 --> 00:34:01.260
recommend investing internationally as well?

522
00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:05.600
<v 0>Hmm.
Uh,
so I,
I do.
Yes.
Um,
I,</v>

523
00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:07.710
I think that it is a very good idea.
Again,

524
00:34:07.711 --> 00:34:12.090
this is one of those controversial topics where there are,

525
00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:14.640
there are some people,
JL Collins being an example.

526
00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:20.030
He makes the argument that if you are invested in major companies that are based

527
00:34:22.561 --> 00:34:27.510
in the United States like the,
like Google or Nike or you know,
uh,

528
00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:28.830
many of the,

529
00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:33.510
the big companies based here do business in countries around the world.

530
00:34:33.511 --> 00:34:38.511
And so he and many other people make the argument that simply by virtue of the

531
00:34:38.731 --> 00:34:41.430
investing in large cap us companies,

532
00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:46.700
you necessarily have international exposure through indirectly through that.

533
00:34:47.311 --> 00:34:48.450
And,
um,

534
00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:52.710
and his argument is that for that reason,

535
00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:57.360
international funds are unnecessary.
They also,
oftentimes,

536
00:34:57.361 --> 00:35:01.230
depending on the specifics of the type of plan that your company offers,

537
00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:06.840
these can often be,
these funds can often be more expensive.
And,

538
00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:07.680
um,

539
00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:12.330
there's also currency risk because you're using US dollars to invest in,

540
00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:17.580
um,
you know,
in,
uh,
companies to operate in different currencies.

541
00:35:17.581 --> 00:35:22.581
And so in addition to all of the risks that you have when you become an investor

542
00:35:22.891 --> 00:35:25.680
in a company,
which is what happens whenever you buy a stock,

543
00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:30.000
you also have currency conversion risk to contend with as well.

544
00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:31.410
So for that reason,

545
00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:36.420
there is a camp of people who think the international investing is personally,

546
00:35:38.701 --> 00:35:39.534
I disagree.

547
00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:43.920
I think that it is important to have an international component to your

548
00:35:43.921 --> 00:35:45.570
portfolio.
Um,

549
00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:49.710
and so there are three subsets,

550
00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:53.730
major subsets to international investing.
There's a developed markets,

551
00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:56.430
emerging markets and frontier markets.

552
00:35:56.760 --> 00:36:01.260
And I would argue that at a minimum developed markets,
uh,

553
00:36:01.261 --> 00:36:05.910
which are well established,
stable markets should be a piece of your portfolio.

554
00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:09.720
Emerging markets probably if you know,
if you can,

555
00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:11.730
they tend to be a little bit more volatile,

556
00:36:11.731 --> 00:36:14.190
but if you have the stomach to withstand that volatility,

557
00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:17.620
I think that's also an excellent addition.
Um,

558
00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:23.270
frontier markets might be a little bit too to a volatile for a lot of people,

559
00:36:24.151 --> 00:36:27.030
so I wouldn't necessarily go there.
Gotcha.

560
00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:32.060
<v 2>And I'm sorry of your episodes have gone in to kind of behavioral finance,
um,</v>

561
00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:34.540
which I know a lot of us find very interesting.

562
00:36:34.541 --> 00:36:37.760
And so can you kind of share some key lessons you've learned on,
you know,

563
00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:41.230
how psychology impacts investing and maybe what we should do about it?
Yeah.

564
00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:47.380
<v 0>So first there's this notion of loss aversion and loss aversion is the concept</v>

565
00:36:48.321 --> 00:36:53.321
that losing money feels worse than making the equivalent amount of money.

566
00:36:55.570 --> 00:37:00.570
If you make an an if you invest $5,000 and you lose a thousand and now you're

567
00:37:01.011 --> 00:37:01.844
down to four,

568
00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:07.180
that feels a lot worse then then the joy that you would feel if that 5,000 went

569
00:37:08.871 --> 00:37:12.260
up to six.
And so,
uh,

570
00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:17.120
loss aversion and you know,
it's closely related cousin negativity bias,

571
00:37:17.570 --> 00:37:18.403
um,

572
00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:23.800
highlights how we often can spend more time playing defense than we do,

573
00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:26.750
um,
playing offense,
right?

574
00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:31.550
We spend more time and energy trying to protect ourselves from the downside.

575
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:36.050
Then we do trying to,
uh,
pursue opportunities.

576
00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:38.360
And that's something as you,

577
00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:44.140
as you feel yourself emotionally reacting to your investments,

578
00:37:44.601 --> 00:37:47.600
like if you make a practice of tracking your net worth and let's,

579
00:37:47.650 --> 00:37:52.010
and you do this w quarterly,
you probably,

580
00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:59.030
you're probably going to have some quarters unless you're very lucky.
Uh,

581
00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:04.040
there might be quarters where your net worth goes down,
um,
perhaps significantly.

582
00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:06.710
And when that happens,

583
00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:11.920
you will feel that sense of like that seeing your net worth decline feels a lot

584
00:38:12.711 --> 00:38:16.760
worse than the joy you felt the previous quarter watching it go up.
Um,

585
00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:19.580
and that's that moment to check in with yourself and say,

586
00:38:19.581 --> 00:38:21.380
am I about to do something stupid?

587
00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:26.720
And I about to make an impulsive decision based on this feeling that I have

588
00:38:26.721 --> 00:38:30.260
right now.
Um,
so that's one of the components.

589
00:38:30.261 --> 00:38:35.261
Loss aversion is one of the behavioral components of managing yourself an

590
00:38:35.531 --> 00:38:35.921
investor.

591
00:38:35.921 --> 00:38:40.921
I would argue that managing yourself and managing your own mindset is the

592
00:38:42.791 --> 00:38:44.890
precursor to managing money.

593
00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:49.270
You can't effectively manage your money until you've managed your,

594
00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:53.230
your mental space.
Um,
so in addition to loss aversion,

595
00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:58.250
sunk cost fallacy is another popular fallacy that people get hung up on.

596
00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:03.610
Sunk cost fallacy is this notion that I'm already in it.

597
00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:08.020
I may as well stay in it.
Um,

598
00:39:08.050 --> 00:39:11.110
I've already put in so much time and effort,

599
00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:14.170
I may as well keep doing it.
I see this a lot.
What will,

600
00:39:14.171 --> 00:39:16.420
when people buy rental properties,
right?
You'll make it,

601
00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:20.110
you'll make 10 offers on properties,
none of them get accepted.

602
00:39:20.111 --> 00:39:23.680
You make the 11th offer,
it finally gets accepted,

603
00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:27.850
and then you send an inspector out to the property and the inspector finds

604
00:39:27.851 --> 00:39:32.230
something completely unanticipated and you think to yourself,

605
00:39:32.231 --> 00:39:35.500
I've put in so much work just trying to find this property.

606
00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:39.850
Plus I've paid $400 for the inspector.
Um,
you know,

607
00:39:39.851 --> 00:39:42.820
this is already cost to me so many hours of my time,

608
00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:48.760
let's just buy the thing.
Right?
And that's,
that's sunk cost fallacy.

609
00:39:48.761 --> 00:39:52.660
Now that you're this deep into it,
you don't want to give it up,
but that's not

610
00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:59.540
an effective framework for making that type of six figure decision.
Uh,

611
00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:02.950
anchoring is another one.
So anchoring is this notion of,
well,
I,

612
00:40:03.250 --> 00:40:07.660
I paid $100 for the stock and so now I'm price anchor to it.

613
00:40:07.661 --> 00:40:10.720
At a hundred,
the stock has dropped to 70.

614
00:40:11.410 --> 00:40:15.400
I'm just going to wait until it gets back up to a hundred and then I'll sell it.

615
00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:19.390
Right?
Uh,
that's a tempting thought to have.
But in reality,

616
00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:21.640
it's completely illogical.

617
00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:25.180
This stock does not care what you paid for it.

618
00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:31.900
So those are all examples of very,
very common,
um,

619
00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:36.520
mental fallacies that we can fall into as we think about how to manage our
money.

620
00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:40.500
<v 2>And so knowing that psychology has such a major influence on investing,</v>

621
00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:43.590
when one thing I'd like to hear from you is,
um,

622
00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:46.590
so going back to the ass out asset allocation,
if you're young,

623
00:40:46.591 --> 00:40:49.770
if you're in your 20s or 30s,
you should be predominantly all stocks.

624
00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:53.820
So it seems like in some people are even preaching the 100% stocks,
for example.

625
00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:55.920
And that's extremely aggressive,

626
00:40:56.370 --> 00:40:58.890
especially because a lot of millennials have never,

627
00:40:58.950 --> 00:41:02.730
they haven't gone through 2008,
for example,
with money and the market.
Right?
So,

628
00:41:02.731 --> 00:41:04.500
I guess my thought is,
um,

629
00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:07.620
knowing again going back to the loss aversion and things like that,

630
00:41:07.621 --> 00:41:11.430
do you actually recommend maybe young people have a more conservative allocation

631
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:16.750
and until they see how they react going through volatility or a bear market and

632
00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:21.120
making sure they can handle that sort of,
you know,
volatility or loss.
Uh,

633
00:41:21.121 --> 00:41:22.350
and then once they do that,

634
00:41:22.351 --> 00:41:25.490
maybe they could actually then take on a more aggressive,
uh,

635
00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:27.270
allocation knowing they can handle it.

636
00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:31.050
<v 0>I would,
I would not recommend that for all young people,</v>

637
00:41:31.350 --> 00:41:35.480
but I would ask each individual person to,
uh,

638
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:36.710
to know yourself.

639
00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:41.740
If you think that there is a reasonable likelihood that you might panic.

640
00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:45.500
Um,
the next time that we have a recession,

641
00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:50.150
then put those safeguards in place that will save you from yourself.

642
00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:54.350
And so the,
the tactic that you just cited,
which is,
uh,

643
00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:59.380
have a heavier bond allocation or a heavier cash allocation when you're young,

644
00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:03.710
um,
so that you can see how you reacted the next recession.

645
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:08.360
That's an example of a way that you can build a safe guard in which you protect

646
00:42:08.361 --> 00:42:12.440
yourself from yourself.
Um,
that's one of many examples.

647
00:42:12.441 --> 00:42:14.060
You could also,
uh,

648
00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:18.950
work with an advisor and give them clear instructions to like no matter when we

649
00:42:18.951 --> 00:42:22.610
have the,
our next pull back,
no matter what I tell you,
right?

650
00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:27.740
Don't let me shoot myself in the foot,
right?
Don't let me be my own worst enemy.

651
00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:33.020
That might be another way of another tactic that allows you to save yourself

652
00:42:33.021 --> 00:42:34.340
from yourself.
But at the end of the day,

653
00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:39.700
what you want to do is really know yourself and then put those safeguards in

654
00:42:41.811 --> 00:42:46.070
place that allow you,
that they compensate for your weaknesses.

655
00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:48.160
<v 2>Great.
Um,</v>

656
00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:51.190
I have one more question and then I think we actually might have time for a few

657
00:42:51.191 --> 00:42:55.330
audience questions.
So if you want to think about anything you might want to ask,

658
00:42:55.331 --> 00:42:58.930
but first,
um,
before we get there,
let's talk about habits cause that's,

659
00:42:58.931 --> 00:43:00.700
that's a huge component.
You've touched,

660
00:43:00.730 --> 00:43:03.580
chatted a lot about that on your podcast habits and habits building.

661
00:43:03.581 --> 00:43:05.560
Had some great guests come on and talk about that.

662
00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:10.720
And one of the things you said that stuck with me is that basically habits be

663
00:43:10.810 --> 00:43:15.790
willpower any day.
And,
um,
and I think that's fascinating,

664
00:43:15.791 --> 00:43:16.301
right?
It's like,

665
00:43:16.301 --> 00:43:20.230
it's very hard to walk by like a donut or something and not to grab it.

666
00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:24.370
But if you in advance develop a habit to not walk by the Donut,

667
00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:28.180
it's very easy.
So can you chat more about that?
The building,
the habits?

668
00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:32.260
<v 0>Oh,
this is one of my favorite topics.
Okay.
So first of all,
yes.</v>

669
00:43:32.261 --> 00:43:36.760
Habits beat willpower.
Um,
the notion is willpower is kind of like a muscle.

670
00:43:36.850 --> 00:43:40.390
It tends to be for most people it tends to be strongest in the morning and

671
00:43:40.391 --> 00:43:43.330
weakest at night,
which is why a lot of people have,
uh,
you know,

672
00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:46.870
they stick to their eating plan for the whole day and then they had that late

673
00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:51.760
night snack that,
um,
you know,
that they never intended to have.
But it's,

674
00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:57.060
it's 11:00 PM and you're tired and this seems like the perfect moment to,

675
00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:00.580
to eat that donut.
Right?
Uh,

676
00:44:01.330 --> 00:44:03.700
when you create the habits,

677
00:44:03.701 --> 00:44:07.150
those habits are largely unconscious,
right?

678
00:44:07.151 --> 00:44:10.580
When I wake up in the morning,
um,

679
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:12.550
well when I pick up my toothbrush,

680
00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:16.450
the next thing that I do is I pick up my tube of toothpaste and I put the

681
00:44:16.451 --> 00:44:19.480
toothpaste on the toothbrush.
That's not a conscious thought.

682
00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:22.270
I don't pick up my toothbrush and then stand there looking at it,

683
00:44:22.271 --> 00:44:27.100
wondering what to do next.
Right?
It's,
it's muscle memory.
It's a habit.

684
00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:31.700
This,
this is the trigger or cue picking up my toothbrushes,

685
00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:36.740
the trigger or cue that precedes the next immediate action,

686
00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:41.730
which is picking up that tube of toothpaste.
And so,
um,

687
00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:44.790
in order to form a habit,
things to be conscious of,

688
00:44:44.791 --> 00:44:49.530
and this comes from Charles Duhigg in his book,
the power of habit is time,

689
00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:54.780
location,
immediately preceding action,
uh,
emotional state,

690
00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:58.200
right?
And if there's a particular habit that you're trying to break,
um,

691
00:44:58.590 --> 00:44:59.580
he gave the example of,

692
00:44:59.581 --> 00:45:03.270
he would always get up and start around three 30 in the afternoon,

693
00:45:03.271 --> 00:45:06.420
he would get up and he would eat a cookie.
And he just kept doing this.

694
00:45:06.421 --> 00:45:09.690
And then he kept eating cookies and he started gaining weight.
Um,

695
00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:11.490
and so he,

696
00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:15.660
he then he noted the time he noted the location.

697
00:45:15.661 --> 00:45:18.240
He noted the emotional state that he was in,

698
00:45:18.241 --> 00:45:22.740
which was kind of bored or restless or wanting to a break around that time.

699
00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:28.070
And he was able to replace getting a cookie with just taking a walk and you

700
00:45:30.391 --> 00:45:34.860
know,
uh,
satisfying that emotional state,
satisfying the state of like boredom,

701
00:45:34.861 --> 00:45:38.160
restlessness without the cookie.
Um,
so he,

702
00:45:38.490 --> 00:45:42.870
he kept the cue or trigger and then he kept the reward,

703
00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:48.030
which was the satisfaction of his restlessness like that entertainment and

704
00:45:48.031 --> 00:45:51.180
distraction.
And he replaced the action in the middle.

705
00:45:51.181 --> 00:45:54.210
So if you break down a habit into cue,
action,

706
00:45:54.211 --> 00:45:57.540
reward than keep the queue,
keep the reward,

707
00:45:57.990 --> 00:45:59.850
switch out the action.
Uh,

708
00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:04.880
there's this notion also called habit stacking and that is to build habits on

709
00:46:06.271 --> 00:46:10.570
top of other habits.
And so,
um,
uh,

710
00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:15.660
the reason that habit stacking works so well is because every habit needs a

711
00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:19.320
given queue.
If you have a queue already,

712
00:46:19.321 --> 00:46:21.780
because that Q is a habit that you're already doing,

713
00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:24.120
then since you're already doing it,

714
00:46:24.330 --> 00:46:28.890
you know that you can stack another habit on top of that.
So for example,

715
00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:31.560
every morning I make a cup of coffee.
Um,

716
00:46:31.650 --> 00:46:36.270
earlier this year I decided that I wanted to create a habit of writing in a

717
00:46:36.271 --> 00:46:39.000
journal.
And so I stack,

718
00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:42.870
I now stack my journal writing habit with my coffee habit.

719
00:46:43.110 --> 00:46:47.970
I will never forget to drink coffee in the morning.
That's impossible.
Um,

720
00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:50.310
and so when I have that cup of coffee,

721
00:46:50.311 --> 00:46:55.050
that is now the cue or the trigger that tells me time to write in a journal.

722
00:46:56.130 --> 00:46:59.340
So,
and then the next habit that I will form and,

723
00:46:59.341 --> 00:47:03.570
and it's typically most effective to only form a one habit at a time.

724
00:47:03.571 --> 00:47:06.870
A lot of people try to stack on too many habits all at once,

725
00:47:06.871 --> 00:47:11.130
and then the whole thing collapses.
So choose one habit.
For me,

726
00:47:11.131 --> 00:47:15.780
it was writing in my journal,
uh,
stick with that for 30 to 60 days.

727
00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:18.900
And then at the end of that,
then add in another one.

728
00:47:19.170 --> 00:47:22.860
So right now it's the end of February.
I started the journal Habit,

729
00:47:22.861 --> 00:47:26.820
it's been about 60 days.
And now that that has been pretty consistent,

730
00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:28.650
now I can add on the next habit.

731
00:47:28.651 --> 00:47:32.200
And so the thing I'd like to do is meditate for about 10 minutes.

732
00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:36.970
And my intention is again,
that habit stacking coffee journal,

733
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.420
meditate.
So each one is a cue or a trigger for the next.

734
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:45.530
<v 2>How do you think about,
um,
cashflow investing with real estate?</v>

735
00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:47.840
You like an LP in a fund or do you,

736
00:47:47.841 --> 00:47:50.620
are you sole proprietor and you buy apartment buildings and you manage them?

737
00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:55.340
<v 0>What do you do?
So I personally,
uh,
again,</v>

738
00:47:55.700 --> 00:48:00.020
I want to spend as little time on real estate as possible for,
for myself.

739
00:48:00.021 --> 00:48:04.040
And of course every real estate investor is going to have a different strategy

740
00:48:04.041 --> 00:48:07.610
based on what your career is,
what your business is,
you know,

741
00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:12.830
how much time do you have?
For Myself,
uh,
with that passive philosophy,

742
00:48:13.250 --> 00:48:15.230
I want to spend as little time on it as possible.

743
00:48:15.410 --> 00:48:20.410
So I only buy residential rental properties in the United States.

744
00:48:20.481 --> 00:48:21.950
It's the only thing I'm interested in.

745
00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:27.340
And that does not necessarily mean that that is better or worse than any other

746
00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:30.710
type,
you know,
so that,

747
00:48:30.711 --> 00:48:35.711
that is in no way I am in no way implying that that's better than commercial

748
00:48:35.961 --> 00:48:40.940
buildings or warehouses or storage units.
Um,
it's just,

749
00:48:40.941 --> 00:48:41.774
uh,

750
00:48:41.930 --> 00:48:46.930
I want to keep it as simple as possible so that I can focus the vast majority of

751
00:48:47.301 --> 00:48:51.110
my time and energy on my business and my career.
Um,

752
00:48:51.290 --> 00:48:55.220
because that's where I can make the biggest gains.

753
00:48:56.190 --> 00:49:00.720
<v 2>Hi,
Paula.
I have a question going back to the asset allocation,
um,</v>

754
00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:03.120
discussion that David started.
So,

755
00:49:03.121 --> 00:49:06.420
and it's also an coming off that real estate comment.

756
00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:11.100
What is the recommended percentage of your net worth that you would invest in

757
00:49:11.101 --> 00:49:13.710
index funds for rental properties?

758
00:49:13.711 --> 00:49:17.910
Because it seems like all the research I've done on all the dialogue from the

759
00:49:17.911 --> 00:49:21.780
financial independence community is basically split into those two schools of

760
00:49:21.781 --> 00:49:24.720
thought.
Like do index fund investing or buy rental properties.

761
00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:27.000
And if I may outline,

762
00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:30.660
it seems to be the rule of thumb for index fund investing is the 4% safe

763
00:49:30.661 --> 00:49:31.494
withdrawal rate.

764
00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:35.340
And then the rule of thumb for rental property investing would be the type of

765
00:49:35.341 --> 00:49:36.630
cap rate you're going for.

766
00:49:36.631 --> 00:49:40.920
And a going rate for the cap rate might be like a 7%.

767
00:49:41.130 --> 00:49:46.130
So is that a 7% rule versus a 4% rule that accelerates your date to Phi or am I

768
00:49:46.350 --> 00:49:47.370
off there?
Just curious?

769
00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:52.380
<v 0>No,
this is a pretty specific question.
So first of all,
to,</v>

770
00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:56.560
to the first half of your question,
which is what is the proper asset allocation?

771
00:49:56.890 --> 00:50:01.840
Again,
um,
I don't think that there is any specific correct one,
right?

772
00:50:01.841 --> 00:50:04.600
Like at the end of the day,
at a big picture level,

773
00:50:04.601 --> 00:50:09.601
what you're trying to do is increase your net worth in a risk managed way.

774
00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:11.703
And so,

775
00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:16.510
however you can increase your net worth in a way that is comfortable to you,

776
00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:21.460
um,
is,
is the,
the way to do it right?
The best.

777
00:50:21.461 --> 00:50:25.420
The quote unquote best strategy in the world is the one that you'll actually

778
00:50:25.421 --> 00:50:26.860
stick to.
Because ultimately,

779
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:29.760
regardless of whether your contributions are going to,
uh,

780
00:50:29.810 --> 00:50:32.000
rental properties versus index funds,

781
00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:35.630
your contributions are going to be the single biggest determinant of your

782
00:50:35.631 --> 00:50:39.620
success.
And so if you,
and again,

783
00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:42.980
humans can play these psychological

784
00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:48.620
tricks on themselves,
like we have this tendency to compartmentalize money.

785
00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:52.820
Like if you think about it,
money is money.
You've got this big pool of,

786
00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:57.590
of assets and it's all money.
But if we compartmentalize it and mentally,

787
00:50:57.591 --> 00:51:02.060
if we think this is the batch that's going to be used for my kid's college fund,

788
00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:02.511
well,

789
00:51:02.511 --> 00:51:07.511
we're less likely to take the kids' college fund batch and spend it on caviar

790
00:51:07.851 --> 00:51:08.780
and champagne,

791
00:51:09.050 --> 00:51:14.050
even though we might take a batch from this other bucket and spend that on

792
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:17.840
caviar and champagne,
right?
Ultimately,
it's all your net worth.

793
00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:22.610
It's all your money.
But compartmentalizing is very powerful.

794
00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:26.630
And so that really in terms of asset allocation is what I would encourage you to

795
00:51:26.631 --> 00:51:31.010
do if you can compartmentalize like this.
You know,

796
00:51:31.310 --> 00:51:34.880
maybe the income that I make,
uh,
from,
you know,

797
00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:38.730
the income that I make from,
uh,

798
00:51:38.770 --> 00:51:42.830
this freelance thing that I do on the side goes towards rental properties.

799
00:51:42.831 --> 00:51:46.400
But the income that I make from my primary job goes towards index funds or vice

800
00:51:46.401 --> 00:51:50.960
versa,
whatever,
you know,
it doesn't matter what the decision is.
Um,
that,

801
00:51:51.110 --> 00:51:56.110
that compartmentalization can often be a motivator that helps you increase

802
00:51:57.321 --> 00:51:58.101
contributions.

803
00:51:58.101 --> 00:52:03.050
And I think that is far more important than the tactic of nailing a proper asset

804
00:52:03.051 --> 00:52:06.710
allocation.
Nice.
Sorry,
one last one.

805
00:52:10.170 --> 00:52:11.003
Right.

806
00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:16.770
<v 3>All right.
First,
thanks for coming out and talking with us.
Um,</v>

807
00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:20.860
so my question has to do with,
um,
with asset allocation to a degree,

808
00:52:20.861 --> 00:52:25.450
but also real estate and equity.
So ultimately,
all right.

809
00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:27.490
If,
um,
you know,

810
00:52:27.491 --> 00:52:31.480
if you're noticing that a substantial portion of your net worth is in home

811
00:52:31.481 --> 00:52:32.314
equity,

812
00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:36.340
what are kind of the key points to factor into the decision of whether or not to

813
00:52:36.341 --> 00:52:40.000
pull the equity to invest?
So,
you know,
ultimately you discussed,
you know,

814
00:52:40.001 --> 00:52:44.410
4% and change if it's a home equity line,
if there was a variable versus fixed,

815
00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:49.140
what are you looking for as far as,
you know,
the mission seven or 8% return,
um,

816
00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:50.710
kind of that gap.

817
00:52:50.711 --> 00:52:54.160
What's that spread that you kind of look for to decide whether or not it's

818
00:52:54.161 --> 00:52:56.590
meaningful to,
uh,
to actually pull money out of investing?

819
00:52:56.810 --> 00:53:01.070
<v 0>Oh,
that's an excellent question.
So the concept of,
um,</v>

820
00:53:01.071 --> 00:53:05.480
if you have a significant amount of home equity in your personal residence,
uh,

821
00:53:05.810 --> 00:53:08.780
pulling that home equity out to invest.
Now,
first off,

822
00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:12.020
first thing I'll say is a lot of people have a knee jerk reaction to this where

823
00:53:12.021 --> 00:53:14.750
they think,
oh no,
don't do that.
That's not a good idea.

824
00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:19.220
But if you think about it logically,
right,
what is the difference between,

825
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:21.463
uh,

826
00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:27.100
what is the difference between taking money that you would otherwise use to make

827
00:53:27.421 --> 00:53:32.190
accelerated mortgage payments and using that for an alternate purpose versus

828
00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:36.960
having a good amount of home equity and then borrowing against it for same set

829
00:53:36.961 --> 00:53:41.340
alternate purpose,
right?
Uh,
at a,
at a functional level,

830
00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:45.990
those are exactly the same actions,
but a lot of people will say,
um,

831
00:53:46.590 --> 00:53:48.570
you know,
person a will say,

832
00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:52.740
I'm not making any accelerated payments towards my mortgage because I would

833
00:53:52.741 --> 00:53:57.741
rather put that money into investment x and person B would say,

834
00:53:58.740 --> 00:53:59.430
uh,

835
00:53:59.430 --> 00:54:03.810
I am making accelerated payments towards my mortgage and now look,

836
00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:05.190
I've got all of this home equity,

837
00:54:05.191 --> 00:54:08.760
I'm going to borrow against it and put that money towards investment X.
Right?

838
00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:10.560
Like,
it's,
it's the same thing.

839
00:54:10.561 --> 00:54:12.980
So the first thing I'll say in them thing this for the sake of everyone who's

840
00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:14.670
listening is,
you know,

841
00:54:14.671 --> 00:54:18.540
don't have that knee jerk reaction against a borrowing against the equity in

842
00:54:18.541 --> 00:54:23.380
your personal residence because,
um,
it,
in many ways,
uh,

843
00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:28.440
we,
many of us are already doing it through opportunity cost.

844
00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:31.260
So then to answer your specific question,

845
00:54:31.261 --> 00:54:35.550
how would I think through whether or not to do it for a given investment?

846
00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:37.860
Um,
I,

847
00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:42.960
the first thing that I would ask is not the potential return on that investment,

848
00:54:42.961 --> 00:54:47.010
but I would ask what is the risk of ruin?
Right?
What is,

849
00:54:47.130 --> 00:54:52.130
what are the chances that that money that you withdraw could go down to zero on

850
00:54:52.981 --> 00:54:57.981
something like a broad market index fund or a rental property.

851
00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:03.180
The chances of that,
the chances of that falling,
sure that's there,

852
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:07.680
but the chances of that dropping by 50%,
you know,

853
00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:09.180
or um,
you know,

854
00:55:09.210 --> 00:55:14.210
losing a very significant amount of money is historically speaking,

855
00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:20.160
not that likely to happen,
you know.
So in that regard,

856
00:55:20.161 --> 00:55:24.450
your downside is at least historically speaking,
limited.

857
00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:27.150
And in that to that extent,

858
00:55:27.151 --> 00:55:30.930
that makes it a safer than say,

859
00:55:30.931 --> 00:55:35.580
taking out that same Wheelock and using it to start your own business,

860
00:55:35.850 --> 00:55:40.830
which could go down to zero.
So,
um,
so that,

861
00:55:40.831 --> 00:55:44.280
that's the way that I would approach it is manage the downside,

862
00:55:44.281 --> 00:55:48.360
manage the risk of ruin because so long as that money,

863
00:55:49.170 --> 00:55:52.710
um,
in a worst case scenario,
so long as even even,

864
00:55:52.711 --> 00:55:54.330
even if you don't make any returns,

865
00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:59.010
if at the end of the day you break even and then you're mad at yourself because

866
00:55:59.011 --> 00:56:01.880
you've just paid a bunch of closing costs,
yeah,

867
00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:04.620
that's not going to be a deathbed regret.
Right.

868
00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:08.700
<v 2>Great.
Well,
that's all the time.
We have a last question for Paula.</v>

869
00:56:08.701 --> 00:56:10.770
For those that are interested in,
want to learn about more,

870
00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:13.980
learn more about you and,
and,
uh,
afford anything,
where should they go?

871
00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:16.950
<v 0>So my podcast is called afford anything,</v>

872
00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:21.690
so you can find it wherever podcasts are found and my website is afford

873
00:56:21.691 --> 00:56:23.890
anything.com.
Great.
Well thanks everyone.
