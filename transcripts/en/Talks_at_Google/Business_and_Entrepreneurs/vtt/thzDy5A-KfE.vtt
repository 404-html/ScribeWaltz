1
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.150
Good morning.
Good morning.
Thank you all so much for coming today.
Google.

2
00:00:12.151 --> 00:00:14.400
We're delighted to welcome Patty McCord.

3
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.620
Patty is one of the world's foremost experts on company culture.
Uh,

4
00:00:19.621 --> 00:00:24.621
she was an early employee at Netflix and she was a coauthor of the famous,

5
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.180
uh,
Netflix culture deck,

6
00:00:27.181 --> 00:00:31.260
which a Sheryl Sandberg said was one of the most important documents to come out

7
00:00:31.261 --> 00:00:33.070
of Silicon Valley.
Um,

8
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.710
she's here today to discuss her new book titled Powerful Building,

9
00:00:37.711 --> 00:00:41.110
a culture of freedom and responsibility,
um,

10
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.240
which was largely,
um,
an effort to sort of boil down,
uh,

11
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.370
the message of,
of the famous a note,
uh,
Netflix culture deck.

12
00:00:50.371 --> 00:00:53.550
So please join me in welcoming to Google,
uh,
Miss Patty McCord.

13
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.760
<v 2>So I'm just going to couple how many people have seen the Netflix culture deck?</v>

14
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.690
A couple of you?
Um,
it,
I didn't ride it.

15
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.030
I didn't coauthor it with Reed Hastings,

16
00:01:10.031 --> 00:01:14.230
the CEO of Netflix Reed an I did another company before Netflix,

17
00:01:14.231 --> 00:01:16.210
a company called pure software.

18
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.890
We sold software tools to other software engineers and we grew through merger

19
00:01:20.891 --> 00:01:24.370
and acquisition.
And how we grew was a,

20
00:01:24.371 --> 00:01:27.490
we'd acquire a company and every time we'd acquire company we'd double.

21
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.400
So we were like a hundred,
200,
416 ride.

22
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.160
And then we sold the company to our largest competitor.

23
00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.760
And my job was to take their employee handbook and our employee handbook and

24
00:01:36.761 --> 00:01:39.850
smash them together and come up with the fewest pos,

25
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.110
the fewest policies that would piss off the fewest people.

26
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.240
And so what we decided to do at Netflix that was different was pay attention to

27
00:01:49.241 --> 00:01:51.430
the kind of company that we were working at,

28
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.550
primarily for totally selfish reasons.

29
00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.520
I didn't want to work with a brilliant assholes anymore and I wanted to have

30
00:02:00.521 --> 00:02:04.390
permission to say no.
And uh,
read wasn't very,

31
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.350
very tolerant of people who weren't very smart or weren't very into the company.

32
00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.340
So what we decided to do differently for those of you that have read the Netflix

33
00:02:12.341 --> 00:02:14.320
culture deck is just write stuff down.

34
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.720
So my journey was not only to write down what kind of company that we wanted to

35
00:02:19.721 --> 00:02:24.160
work at.
My job was to be the COO of that culture,

36
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.220
which meant if we said this,
then did we do this?

37
00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.700
And that's the part where most companies get it wrong.

38
00:02:30.701 --> 00:02:35.050
And I want you to go away from my talk today and think about what you're doing

39
00:02:35.051 --> 00:02:39.520
here and what you're saying you are as Google and who you really are acting as

40
00:02:39.521 --> 00:02:42.940
Google because that's what company culture really is.

41
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.720
So since I've been away,

42
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.000
I get to talk to people who are outside of business and who are,

43
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.450
um,
people who are kind of on the speaker circuit.

44
00:02:55.451 --> 00:03:00.010
So I ended up on stage with a lot of coaches,
like real coaches,

45
00:03:00.011 --> 00:03:02.050
like from real professional sports teams.

46
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.730
So I was in Montreal last year in February.

47
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.500
Has Anybody been to Montreal in February?
So cold,

48
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.120
it is so cold.
So I called up my daughter and I said,
hey,
by the way,

49
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:19.360
I'm doing this talk in Montreal in February.
She's like,
mom,
go to Patagonia.

50
00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:21.730
Go now,
get a puffy coat,
get the big one.

51
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.890
So then I realized how Dang cold it is in Montreal in February.

52
00:03:26.891 --> 00:03:31.840
So I figured out my hotel so that I can go underground so that I can go up to

53
00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:34.300
the venue,
which is a place called the bell centre.

54
00:03:34.301 --> 00:03:37.000
Does anybody know what happens at the Bell Center in Montreal?

55
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.460
You know hockey fans,
Huh?
Okay.
Well that's where the Stanley Cup is played.

56
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.450
Um,

57
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.020
now at this point I've been talking to groups who are a little bigger than you,

58
00:03:47.021 --> 00:03:50.710
but not much.
Like as if this room was full as kind of my biggest audience.

59
00:03:50.711 --> 00:03:54.460
So I go down below and at the last minute they said to me,
oh by the way,

60
00:03:54.461 --> 00:03:55.930
you're not going to be on stage alone.

61
00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.450
You're going to be with this guy named Scotty Bowman.

62
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.990
So I Google Scotty Bowman and he's a hockey coach.

63
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.030
He's the winning his hockey coach in history in the national hockey league.

64
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.250
So I made him under ground.
Right?

65
00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:14.050
We're underground at this venue and he's this older gentleman,
he's like 70,

66
00:04:14.051 --> 00:04:18.460
and he has on a little suit with the maple leaf pen and an American flag.

67
00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.960
And we're talking about his grandkids.
And um,
he says to me,

68
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.250
we're under the ice and then it occurs to me,

69
00:04:27.251 --> 00:04:31.330
we're in a hockey stadium,
like a hockey stadium,
right?

70
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.330
So it's not you guys,
it's not this little intimate room.

71
00:04:34.331 --> 00:04:39.070
I go up on stage and my face is on the jumbo tron.
I mean,
he was like,

72
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.133
ah,

73
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.860
it's really scary and there's thousands of people in the audience.

74
00:04:44.861 --> 00:04:48.100
And so they,
he introduces me nice introduction.

75
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.150
The audience claps very politely and I go sit on my little velvet couch and

76
00:04:52.151 --> 00:04:55.960
Scott Bowman comes up and the place goes crazy.

77
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.950
I'm in Montreal in a hockey stadium with the winningest hockey coach in history.

78
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.240
They're clapping like this,
right?
If they had had those foam fingers,

79
00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:06.070
they'd be doing the foam fingers.
I mean,

80
00:05:06.071 --> 00:05:11.071
people are like taking selfies because I'm on stage with God as far as they're

81
00:05:11.741 --> 00:05:15.100
concerned in Montreal.
So he comes up,

82
00:05:15.101 --> 00:05:19.900
he sits down the master of ceremonies who has a diamond earring and you know,

83
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.610
teleprompter and he's doing the work in the audience and he says,

84
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.830
Mr.
Bowman,
you know,
you're such a legend.
You've won so many tournaments,

85
00:05:29.831 --> 00:05:34.300
you've played with all the great players.
What does it take to be a winning team?

86
00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:38.440
How do you give people feedback?
And he says,
uh,
well,

87
00:05:38.441 --> 00:05:42.520
we have an 80 game season and every 10 games I sit down with each player and I

88
00:05:42.521 --> 00:05:45.850
do an assessment of how they're doing.
They do a self assessment,

89
00:05:45.851 --> 00:05:49.150
we pull all the stats,
we get feedback from the other coaches,

90
00:05:49.151 --> 00:05:50.860
we get feedback from the other players.

91
00:05:50.861 --> 00:05:53.260
We talk about who we're going to play in the next 10 games,

92
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.200
what the competition is,
where their strengths and weaknesses are.

93
00:05:56.201 --> 00:06:00.440
And we put together a that we're going to execute for the next 10 the game so

94
00:06:00.441 --> 00:06:05.180
that that person can be an incredibly high performer.
So the guy says to me,

95
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:06.740
Patty Mccord,
um,

96
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.090
you've been known for saying how much you hate the annual performance review.
Uh,

97
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.961
and I do.

98
00:06:11.961 --> 00:06:16.340
I think it's an utter total waste of time for most companies that do it that
way.

99
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.140
And so he said,
if you didn't do that,
what would you do instead?
And I said,

100
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:22.693
what?
He said,

101
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.550
because the thing is that sports coaches know how to put together teams that
win.

102
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.170
And that's really all that management really is as far as I'm concerned.

103
00:06:33.171 --> 00:06:36.920
For 30 years I'd been watching people put together teams and it's all about

104
00:06:36.921 --> 00:06:41.750
doing that.
And the reason I also put the slide up that says team is that,

105
00:06:41.751 --> 00:06:45.530
and I,
you know,
you probably don't say this much here,
but in case you do,

106
00:06:45.531 --> 00:06:49.950
you're not a family,
right?
Work isn't your family,
you,

107
00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.500
it's not undying love.

108
00:06:51.501 --> 00:06:54.980
You're not going to loan your deadbeat brother-in-law money and he'll never pay

109
00:06:54.981 --> 00:06:59.960
you back because you always do cause this is work and you come together to do

110
00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:04.760
something that you can only do here and that's create terrific products that

111
00:07:04.761 --> 00:07:05.810
make people happy.

112
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:10.880
And that joy I think of working is what really makes people happy.

113
00:07:10.881 --> 00:07:15.830
And I say that here at Google where you have God's gift,
everything right?

114
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:18.920
And I know that when you go home and you say,
oh my God,

115
00:07:18.921 --> 00:07:20.480
it was an amazing day at work.

116
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.410
Almost always when you say that truthfully from your soul,

117
00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:28.490
it's because you did something hard with really smart people that made you

118
00:07:28.491 --> 00:07:32.870
really effective.
And that's my observations of teams over all those years.

119
00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:38.360
And then in order to make it work,
it's about putting together the right teams.

120
00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.240
So because I started as a recruiter,

121
00:07:41.241 --> 00:07:46.241
I think a lot about talent and what I want to talk to you about is you,

122
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.840
you today,

123
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:53.320
because I think I don't need to lecture you guys about how great organizations

124
00:07:53.691 --> 00:07:58.691
should move fluidly and be more flexible and be more accepting of change because

125
00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.770
that's the world that you live in.

126
00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:05.690
But I want to talk to you about how you navigate through your own career.

127
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.280
So I just did a talk with 1500 HR people.

128
00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.340
I know that's a frightening idea for most of you.

129
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:15.770
It's even a frightening idea for me.

130
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.890
Like when I first started talking to HR people before I wrote the book,

131
00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:22.820
people walked out because I said things that really upset them.

132
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.810
But what I said was to 1500 HR people,

133
00:08:26.811 --> 00:08:30.110
please raise your hand if you're in the job that you had when you graduated from

134
00:08:30.111 --> 00:08:32.090
college.
How many people raise their hand?

135
00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:37.550
Not Right?
How many of you have ever done a layoff?

136
00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:39.620
1500 people raise their hands.

137
00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:43.220
How many of you have ever laid off a family member?
There's always one.

138
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:48.160
Don't ask me why,
but people do that like somebody did.
And then I say,
uh,

139
00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.240
how many of you have said the word family at work?

140
00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:53.900
And 900 people raised their hands,
right?

141
00:08:53.901 --> 00:08:56.310
And I say for all of you aren't in the same job.

142
00:08:56.311 --> 00:09:00.510
You mean none of you could worked for a company that could handle retention,

143
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:05.940
right?
So the truth is that our lives,
our careers,

144
00:09:05.941 --> 00:09:10.620
our full of lots of different jobs in lots of different organizations.

145
00:09:10.621 --> 00:09:15.300
And what I love about Google these days is that you've now admitted that there's

146
00:09:15.301 --> 00:09:18.900
lots of different organizations in the corporation that is Google,

147
00:09:18.901 --> 00:09:20.430
all the alphabet companies.

148
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:25.910
So if you start thinking about your career and how you're going to be successful

149
00:09:25.921 --> 00:09:27.330
and how you're going to move forward,

150
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:32.310
here's my hint from doing this for a very,
very long time,

151
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:38.100
is what you love to do,
that you are extraordinarily good at doing something.

152
00:09:38.101 --> 00:09:40.740
The company you work for needs someone to be great at.

153
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:42.840
So if you wake up in the morning,

154
00:09:42.841 --> 00:09:45.330
you don't want to come to work or you're not looking forward to,

155
00:09:45.331 --> 00:09:49.860
and it seems really horrible,
then something's wrong with Patty's algorithm.

156
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:53.430
And I say algorithm because I worked with geeks all my life and I love you and I

157
00:09:53.431 --> 00:09:58.110
miss you.
But if I say words like algorithm,
it helps,
right?
Okay.

158
00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:02.640
So what you love to do that you're extraordinarily good at doing.

159
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:07.020
Is it important?
So when you find yourself coming to work and thinking,

160
00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.600
they just don't care about how good I am at writing,

161
00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:13.080
they didn't even realize how wonderful I am,
how talented I am.

162
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:18.000
They may realize it and not care.
That's the honest truth,
right?

163
00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:22.020
And the other part is if you need somebody to be really,
really good and really,

164
00:10:22.021 --> 00:10:24.300
really passionate about a problem you're trying to solve,

165
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.660
and they can just do it,
but they don't love it,

166
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:29.940
then you're not happy on the other side either.

167
00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:34.530
So the reason why I'm telling you this is it's your job to navigate this.

168
00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:39.690
It's not somebody else's job to suddenly realize that you're unhappy.
Trust me.

169
00:10:39.691 --> 00:10:41.790
They know,
right?

170
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.840
And it's not somebody else's job to realize that you went home thinking this was

171
00:10:45.841 --> 00:10:48.480
the best working day of your life.
It's yours.

172
00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:51.060
So as you go through your work life,

173
00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:54.630
I want you to be really cognizant of what you're learning,
what you're liking,

174
00:10:54.631 --> 00:10:55.800
what you're not liking.

175
00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.550
Half of what we learned in our careers is the work that we do that we hate,

176
00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:03.210
right?
That's,
I remember driving away from a job once,

177
00:11:03.211 --> 00:11:04.200
looking in the rear view mirror,

178
00:11:04.201 --> 00:11:06.750
like if I never see that place again as long as I live.

179
00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:10.770
And then I tried to pin it down.
What was it about that place that made me crazy?

180
00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:14.970
And it was a company that had thousands and thousands of employees and they talk

181
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.310
the talk to them as head count.
They didn't have names,
they've,

182
00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:22.800
they were just head count to be grown or shrunk or grown or shrunk.

183
00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:24.840
So that's the part about talent.

184
00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:29.550
Your talent is really important to wherever you work and you want to make sure

185
00:11:29.551 --> 00:11:32.280
that you're in a place that recognizes that.

186
00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:36.000
And then the last thing I wanted to talk to you about,

187
00:11:36.001 --> 00:11:37.680
and since we're such an intimate audience,

188
00:11:37.681 --> 00:11:40.550
it'd be really fun if you could talk to me.
Um,

189
00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:43.860
the last thing I wanted to talk to you about is the idea of transformation.

190
00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:48.660
So I spend a whole bunch of time with really big companies who invite me in to

191
00:11:48.661 --> 00:11:51.600
talk about how they're going to transform into an,
you know,

192
00:11:51.601 --> 00:11:55.450
an agile tech company we have here in the valley and they have no clue.

193
00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.570
So they can't do it,
but you can.

194
00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:03.910
And so the way to create the workplace that you want to have is to be vocal

195
00:12:03.911 --> 00:12:07.870
about it and to speak up and for us to start talking to each other.

196
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:10.570
Really honestly about what works and what doesn't work.

197
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:15.580
And I think that you can have incredible conversations about work.

198
00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:20.870
You know the story I told you about Scott Bowman at the beginning of my talk at

199
00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:24.550
a couple of days,
a couple of days ago,
couple of weeks ago,

200
00:12:24.551 --> 00:12:29.350
I was at this thing in Texas and the coach of the San Antonio Spurs,

201
00:12:29.351 --> 00:12:33.910
it's a professional basketball team was on and it was very touchy feely audience

202
00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:36.980
and the wouldn't,
somebody said,
Oh yeah,

203
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.130
my question for you coach is,

204
00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:43.870
it must be really horrible when you have to cut people from the team after

205
00:12:43.871 --> 00:12:47.680
you've put all that energy into recruiting them and having them play a whole

206
00:12:47.681 --> 00:12:51.310
season and they've done their best and in doesn't that feel terrible?

207
00:12:51.311 --> 00:12:55.030
And he said,
no,
actually it doesn't at all.

208
00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:59.620
Like it's professional basketball.
You didn't sign up for a lifetime appointment.

209
00:12:59.621 --> 00:13:02.980
Everybody understands that.
And I was in the audience thinking,

210
00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:06.820
why can't we just have those conversations?
Like why?

211
00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:09.130
Why can't we have those conversations with each other?
You know,

212
00:13:09.131 --> 00:13:14.020
we hired you to do this thing and you were amazing.
Thank you.
We're done,
right?

213
00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:17.440
You're that,
that part's over.
So now what are you going to do next?
Right?

214
00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.360
And what I think about when I think about,
um,

215
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:24.340
Scotty's Scotty's methodology for giving people feedback.

216
00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:29.500
It's called a performance improvement plan.
Too bad we ruined that word.

217
00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:33.220
That,
right?
Like what if we actually got together and said,

218
00:13:33.221 --> 00:13:37.870
let's put together a plan so that we can perform better?
What a concept.

219
00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.200
But that's not what we normally do.

220
00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:46.260
And so that's why I think real transformation comes from two things.

221
00:13:46.361 --> 00:13:51.040
One of them is to stop speaking a language about management that no one

222
00:13:51.041 --> 00:13:56.020
understands and just be able to start telling people the truth.
You know,

223
00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:59.800
I just don't love you anymore.
I don't need Ya.
Or maybe the,

224
00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:03.580
maybe you need something that's more interesting and stimulating over here.

225
00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:08.620
Or maybe you should move on,
right?
Or maybe you're can say,
Hey,

226
00:14:08.621 --> 00:14:09.520
look,
I'm,

227
00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:13.360
I'm looking at a lot of other opportunities and I want to think about what that

228
00:14:13.361 --> 00:14:16.840
means for me.
That you can really have those honest conversations.

229
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:19.840
And the second part is that you can,

230
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:24.550
you can tell the truth about what you want and what you need,

231
00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:28.600
and your managers can tell you the truth about the future and you can navigate

232
00:14:28.601 --> 00:14:32.260
your own careers through all of that and not wait for somebody else to take care

233
00:14:32.261 --> 00:14:35.350
of you.
When I talk to women's groups,
I say,
look,

234
00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:40.650
employee engagement does not mean somebody put a ring on it and interviewing

235
00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:44.890
with another company to find out what you're worth,

236
00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:48.550
which is what your worth by the way.
And if you feel like you're underpaid,

237
00:14:48.551 --> 00:14:51.710
you're and you're waiting for somebody to notice,
that is not going to happen.

238
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:56.390
Go find out what you're worth.
And that happens with interviewing interviews,

239
00:14:56.391 --> 00:14:58.820
get you opportunities,
interviews,
get you jobs.

240
00:14:58.821 --> 00:15:01.070
You should be doing that for the rest of your life.

241
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:06.670
So when your find yourself waiting for someone in management to take care of

242
00:15:07.101 --> 00:15:07.820
you,

243
00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:12.290
I want you to remember my words and go take care of yourself.

244
00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:14.003
<v 0>Okay?</v>

245
00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:19.540
<v 2>That's my talk for today.
Do you guys want to talk to me?
Let's do some Q.
And.</v>

246
00:15:19.541 --> 00:15:24.450
A.
Yeah.
Do you have them?
Do we need mics for?
Yeah,

247
00:15:24.451 --> 00:15:26.040
in case we put it in the video.

248
00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:33.170
The last,
the last slide is my book,
which there are some you get to have.

249
00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.490
<v 3>So if you have an organization,
particularly one like Netflix,</v>

250
00:15:38.491 --> 00:15:41.040
I've had a reputation for this where you know,

251
00:15:41.041 --> 00:15:44.640
a certain number of low performers,
you're going to churn them out each year.

252
00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.380
How do you,
how do you decide where that bars,

253
00:15:46.381 --> 00:15:48.720
do you target like a certain percentage of the organization or

254
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:54.470
<v 2>it wasn't like that at all.
Ever.
Ever.
So here's how it typically happen.</v>

255
00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:58.100
I'll give you a story that anybody here use DVD by mail.

256
00:15:59.250 --> 00:15:59.520
<v 0>Okay.</v>

257
00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:03.780
<v 2>Okay.
Um,
so we had grown,</v>

258
00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:07.140
this is when we were transitioning to streaming when we were transitioning out

259
00:16:07.141 --> 00:16:09.810
of the DVD by mail business into the streaming business.

260
00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:13.800
And we had had an incredible run that particular year,

261
00:16:13.801 --> 00:16:14.910
I don't remember which year it was.

262
00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:19.020
We'd grown 30% quarter over quarter for three quarters in a row.
Right?

263
00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:23.070
So we had our executive staff meeting and read once to go to the whiteboard and

264
00:16:23.071 --> 00:16:25.470
do disaster planning because he loves it.
Like,

265
00:16:25.471 --> 00:16:27.750
what if it goes to shit in a hand basket,
that's his favorite thing to do.

266
00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:32.280
So I say,
Hey for sport,
what if it kept up?

267
00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:35.340
What if we kept growing quarter over quarter,
30%,

268
00:16:35.341 --> 00:16:37.470
quarter over quarter compounded for the next three quarters.

269
00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:39.090
CFO goes to the white board,

270
00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.540
he's doing top line revenue and he's doing that happy dance,

271
00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:43.980
you know like Oh look at that

272
00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:45.303
<v 3>mommy,</v>

273
00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:52.290
<v 2>Ted Sarandos who's our head of contents as at the time we said wistfully some</v>

274
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:57.790
day will be as big as HBO.
Right?
And he says,

275
00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:01.030
Shit you guys,
that's next year.
Right?

276
00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:03.550
It's possible that will be as big as HBO next year.

277
00:17:03.551 --> 00:17:05.580
And we all just looked at each other and Neil,

278
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:09.910
who was our head of product at the time said that's a third of the u s internet

279
00:17:09.911 --> 00:17:14.140
bandwidth.
Right?
So,

280
00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:19.420
and I'm looking at him like,
so afterwards he and I are sitting there,

281
00:17:19.421 --> 00:17:23.980
I'm like does anybody know how to do that right?
Cause files,

282
00:17:23.981 --> 00:17:28.010
video files were so big,
you guys remember you were around that time,
right?

283
00:17:28.011 --> 00:17:32.470
And like,
how do we do,
like we had a data center cause we ship DVDs by mail.

284
00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:37.390
So we're brainstorming like Google is Google is it?
Yahoo was at Ebay,

285
00:17:37.391 --> 00:17:41.650
who's moving that much data that has and has gotta be in the cloud clearly.

286
00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.660
And we're not gonna do this in a data center.

287
00:17:43.661 --> 00:17:48.430
So we sit down with our it guys and they're brilliant.
The these are brilliant,

288
00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:53.040
wonderful,
amazing people.
And we say,
here's the problem set.

289
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:57.480
And they say,
no worries,
you guys go exec something,
we'll build the cloud.

290
00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:03.150
And I looked at them and said,
you know what,
if anybody on earth could do this,

291
00:18:03.151 --> 00:18:08.130
it's you not nine months,
right?
We couldn't,
we couldn't do that.

292
00:18:08.131 --> 00:18:13.131
It was just the timeframe was too short for these people to be those experts to

293
00:18:13.141 --> 00:18:15.480
be able to accomplish the business objective.

294
00:18:15.481 --> 00:18:20.481
And we're certainly not going to miss our window if it's there because we don't

295
00:18:20.581 --> 00:18:24.540
have the right it team.
So I said to them,

296
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:29.370
that's not going to happen.
Right?
So,
but we got nine months to figure it out.

297
00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:33.960
And so we turned that year,
97% of that team,

298
00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:38.730
right.
Because,
and they,
most of them went on to a company called Chegg,

299
00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:41.160
which is a Netflix for textbooks.

300
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:46.430
So they went and they took their physical shipping and receiving database skills

301
00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:51.900
to do that.
So that was typically what happened.
Right.

302
00:18:51.901 --> 00:18:55.200
Typically what happened was we'd either build something and it'd be done.

303
00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:58.950
And when I used to interview Google people,
you know,

304
00:18:58.951 --> 00:19:02.310
people who had an offer with you guys and an offer with us,
I would say,

305
00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.860
look to different problem sets.
Right.

306
00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:07.950
Organizing the world's information is a big problem.

307
00:19:07.951 --> 00:19:12.150
Said we're delivering movies and TV shows to people's homes,

308
00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:16.110
right.
Or their devices.
That's it.
One problem.
That's all we do.

309
00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:20.820
So that's typically what happens.
So the DVD by mail business is still exists.

310
00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:23.580
I don't know if you guys know that.
I still use it on my boat.
Yeah.

311
00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:27.750
And it has a great catalog because it has everything known to humankind because

312
00:19:27.751 --> 00:19:32.670
you don't have to buy rights for it.
Um,
but that business is probably,

313
00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:35.760
I bet there's not a hundred people in that business anymore.

314
00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.920
So that's more what happens.

315
00:19:37.921 --> 00:19:40.590
I know reputationally what Netflix has a reputation for,

316
00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:44.670
but we never said why would we do that if we said in chapter two,

317
00:19:44.671 --> 00:19:46.350
we're a high performance culture.

318
00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:51.330
You don't have to cut the bottom third performers because you don't have them.

319
00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:54.270
And my experience is this.

320
00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.960
If you hire somebody who can't do the job,

321
00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:03.270
they're completely without fault.
That's in the interview process,

322
00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:08.130
right?
That person,
that candidate has no,
there is nothing they did wrong.

323
00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.180
You hired the wrong person.

324
00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:14.360
If you hire somebody and they're close but no cigar,
right?
You know it's like,
ah,

325
00:20:14.361 --> 00:20:16.150
I love you,
I love you man.
I love Ya.

326
00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:22.230
Not really sure you can still do that,
but you should be honest.

327
00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:24.990
Should be able to say to you,
you know what?

328
00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:27.300
You're not exactly the skillset we were looking for,

329
00:20:27.301 --> 00:20:30.000
but we love Ya and we're willing to take the chance if you are.

330
00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:35.230
And then if it doesn't work out,
then it doesn't work out.
Right.
Everybody tried.

331
00:20:35.231 --> 00:20:38.730
So that's what I'm saying.
You can start being honest in an interview.

332
00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:42.720
So that's more typically what happens.
My experiences,

333
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:47.260
you either join a company that you think you're intellectually going to like and

334
00:20:47.261 --> 00:20:48.910
you don't,
when you really get there.

335
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:52.990
Netflix was not a particularly good place for people who liked structure.

336
00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:54.250
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

337
00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:55.930
<v 2>Or,
or,
or liked.</v>

338
00:20:55.980 --> 00:21:00.040
I'm just r and d work because it was so about deliverables.

339
00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:02.660
Thanks.
Sure.

340
00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:03.983
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

341
00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:09.750
<v 4>Right in front of you.
Hi.
Um,
I was wondering,</v>

342
00:21:09.751 --> 00:21:14.751
you have the idea for this generous severance package and the idea that you let

343
00:21:15.361 --> 00:21:17.040
golf people easily,
uh,

344
00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:21.540
did you have to change the company culture to get to the point where that became

345
00:21:21.541 --> 00:21:22.920
acceptable or was that

346
00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:26.520
<v 2>yeah,
it took a,
if you go back and read the Netflix culture deck,</v>

347
00:21:26.521 --> 00:21:29.490
we wrote chapter each chapter after the chapter before it.

348
00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:32.120
So when we said,
um,

349
00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:36.330
we're going to have a high performance culture of adults,
uh,

350
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:39.910
and then we're going to give them a lot of freedom.
Uh,

351
00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:44.010
it probably took four years for me to figure out how to do that.

352
00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:47.340
So I had to figure out the severance package.
So let's,

353
00:21:47.341 --> 00:21:51.810
let's say that in a typical company,
let's say we've hired you to do something.

354
00:21:51.811 --> 00:21:55.740
You've been here four years,
you're amazing.
You've done the DVD by mail guys.

355
00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.110
Right?
Don't need you anymore.

356
00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:01.500
Now I'm going to put you on a performance improvement plan for three months to

357
00:22:01.501 --> 00:22:05.850
prove you're incompetent.
But we both know you're not.
Well,
that's just mean,

358
00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:10.710
right?
So instead I would say,
you know what,

359
00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:15.120
we've been talking about this.
Can't wait to see where you go next.
I mean,

360
00:22:15.121 --> 00:22:16.920
half of my Netflix alumni are here,

361
00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:22.140
so I can't wait to see where you go next.
Um,
here's three months pay.

362
00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:26.240
Let's just not go through this crazy stuff.
That's just no reason to do that.

363
00:22:26.241 --> 00:22:27.880
So that's how I thought about that.

364
00:22:27.881 --> 00:22:32.750
The severance packages was if I did the thing that people normally do and

365
00:22:32.751 --> 00:22:36.860
instead just said,
how much is that worth?
Then I just pay you that.
Um,

366
00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:40.940
I also had to have an incredible recruiting team that would hire the people for

367
00:22:40.941 --> 00:22:43.160
the jobs that we needed getting done in the future.

368
00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:47.810
So that took me a long time to have a really,
really top notch recruiting team.

369
00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:51.610
I had to think about competitive offers.
Um,

370
00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:55.640
I had to think about head count dollars in terms of dollars,

371
00:22:55.641 --> 00:22:59.180
not in terms of number of people.
So in most companies,

372
00:22:59.181 --> 00:23:00.320
I don't know how it works here,

373
00:23:00.321 --> 00:23:03.800
but there's three ways you get a requisition approved if you want to hire

374
00:23:03.801 --> 00:23:07.100
somebody.
In most companies the job,

375
00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:10.430
you write a job description and either describes the person who left that you

376
00:23:10.431 --> 00:23:15.431
wish hadn't a fantasy person that doesn't exist or whatever it takes to get it

377
00:23:16.221 --> 00:23:17.054
approved.

378
00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:21.770
None of those have anything to do with actually hiring somebody to solve the

379
00:23:21.771 --> 00:23:22.604
problem.

380
00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:27.410
And the truth is that when you find somebody who's really qualified to solve the

381
00:23:27.411 --> 00:23:32.300
problem,
you should pay whatever it takes to get them right.
But in some co,

382
00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:36.170
you know,
in some organizations,
especially when I'm with startups,

383
00:23:36.171 --> 00:23:40.880
when they get to step functional scale,
I say that new team is not this team.

384
00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:44.210
You're not going to make them into that particularly on problems with the

385
00:23:44.211 --> 00:23:47.930
complexity.
And so that's how I,
that's how I thought about it.

386
00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:50.990
I thought about it in terms of the whole thing.
You know,

387
00:23:50.991 --> 00:23:55.790
how do we have not just high performers but high performers in each job to solve

388
00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:58.010
each problem?
That's the difference.

389
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000
Do you have any kind of personnel development in and that kind of world?

390
00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:08.090
Yeah,
but not so formally ma.

391
00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:13.150
My experience is the best way to develop is to be around amazing people who you

392
00:24:14.181 --> 00:24:18.230
learn from all the time.
So I did a lot of mapping,
matching with people,

393
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:22.660
putting people with other people that they could learn a lot from and making a,

394
00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:27.700
we had a lot of systems in place to share mostly business information.

395
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:29.930
So a lot of our,
um,

396
00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:34.280
communication and education and the company was around the business,

397
00:24:34.281 --> 00:24:36.650
not necessarily around those skills.

398
00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:40.730
I think you learn best when you can see it,
right?

399
00:24:40.731 --> 00:24:43.040
When you see somebody behaving like a great manager,

400
00:24:43.041 --> 00:24:47.000
then you have a great role model.
Patty.
Um,

401
00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:52.040
compensation teams love the annual performance review because it makes annual

402
00:24:52.041 --> 00:24:56.990
increases equity modeling,
super simple,
perhaps even algorithmic.

403
00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:57.853
Yup.

404
00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:03.760
When you throw that out in favor of lots of feedback and conversations,

405
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.920
how do you connect the dots?

406
00:25:06.921 --> 00:25:09.710
I don't have any problem with an annual compensation review.

407
00:25:09.711 --> 00:25:11.720
I think it's really smart actually.

408
00:25:11.721 --> 00:25:15.350
I recommend that you do them quarterly and walk through the company quarterly.

409
00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:19.430
Um,
the most important way to think about compensation is market based pay.

410
00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:24.410
So,
and the most real,
uh,
compensation information in your companies,

411
00:25:24.411 --> 00:25:26.780
in your recruitment team,
not in the last year survey.

412
00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:30.940
That's what is really happening.
You want to know what's really happening.

413
00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:31.940
That's my problem with,

414
00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:37.160
with most standard compensation teams is they operate on systems and with data

415
00:25:37.161 --> 00:25:40.460
that's really old.
So,
and I don't know if you guys do,

416
00:25:40.461 --> 00:25:43.010
I know that you guys are more analytic than that,

417
00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.710
but so I would usually walk through the organization and say,

418
00:25:45.711 --> 00:25:48.350
where have I hired a lot of people?
Um,

419
00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:51.380
because where I've hired a lot of people that's going to give me really current

420
00:25:51.381 --> 00:25:55.400
salary information that's going to color how I pay the people that are currently

421
00:25:55.401 --> 00:25:59.210
there that you want to stay,
right?
So I don't have any problems at all with it.

422
00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:04.240
The problems I have are when we take the review and the compensation and the

423
00:26:05.631 --> 00:26:10.010
feedback and we throw them all together once a year and we say it solves those

424
00:26:10.011 --> 00:26:12.260
problems.
So I was going to tell you earlier,

425
00:26:12.261 --> 00:26:15.560
the most innovative work I did at Netflix was not anything new.

426
00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:18.590
It was just I stopped doing old things that don't matter anymore.

427
00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:23.180
So the story I told you about Scotty Bowman is his story about giving great

428
00:26:23.181 --> 00:26:27.590
feedback and if you're going to give people great feedback that's going to

429
00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:32.570
affect their performance,
you're not going to do it once a year,
a name,

430
00:26:32.571 --> 00:26:35.780
one of the thing you do once a year that you're good at,
that would be nothing.

431
00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:40.970
Right?
So great feedback.
So if you want to create a system that says,

432
00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:44.400
I believe that feedback improve performance,

433
00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:46.830
I want to create a system that does that,

434
00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:50.160
then who would ever come up with the annual performance review?

435
00:26:50.161 --> 00:26:52.800
It's a dumb system to do that.
If you say,

436
00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:57.030
I want to have an annual compensation review where I do a point in time,

437
00:26:57.031 --> 00:27:02.031
look across the organization and see his pay working out fairly and equitably

438
00:27:02.251 --> 00:27:05.700
for people and is it market based,
right?

439
00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:09.240
Am I paying competitively then that's a completely reasonable exercise to do.

440
00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:13.290
There's where I have the problem is we mush it together and we're not clear.

441
00:27:13.291 --> 00:27:13.800
The other thing,

442
00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:17.220
the other problem I have with a lot of compensation systems is they're not

443
00:27:17.221 --> 00:27:21.420
transparent to employees.
It's magic that happens in HR,

444
00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:25.260
right?
And even some HR people don't know how it works,
right?

445
00:27:25.261 --> 00:27:28.470
The recruiting team doesn't know how the comp team works is this crazy stuff.

446
00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:32.580
So again,
it's about like,
um,

447
00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:36.320
I got rid of the,
uh,
when I was at Netflix,

448
00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:41.160
I got rid of paid time off,
uh,
keeping track of paid time off.

449
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:45.030
I got rid of a travel policies and I got,
I actually,

450
00:27:45.031 --> 00:27:49.440
I didn't get rid of these things.
I,
I vetoed them before we installed them.

451
00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:52.080
Uh,
the travel policy and,

452
00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:55.410
and getting approvals from finance for expenditures.

453
00:27:56.670 --> 00:28:01.670
It seemed insane to me that I would say any expenditure over $5,000 has to be a

454
00:28:02.921 --> 00:28:05.340
pro.
$10,000 has to be approved by finance.

455
00:28:05.341 --> 00:28:10.080
And I got a company full of PhDs in math like a mine.
You know,

456
00:28:10.081 --> 00:28:14.130
they know that 10,001 is more than 10,000 and you don't need somebody in finance

457
00:28:14.131 --> 00:28:14.964
to tell him that.

458
00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:19.680
But they might need somebody in finance to sit with them as an analyst.
Right.

459
00:28:19.681 --> 00:28:22.260
And tell them what things are happening and how they're trending.

460
00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:26.310
Is this the hook?
Are you coming to hook me?
Oh cause you look at your little c,

461
00:28:26.311 --> 00:28:29.940
that's a Google problem.
I told you I'd say that.

462
00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:34.320
Does that make sense to you?
Yet to have any problem with the system.

463
00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:37.470
It's just needs to be transparent and it needs to be.

464
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:42.840
And because your current pain top of market,
the feedback is kind of irrelevant.

465
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:48.150
No,
they're two different things there.
Two,
they're two different things.

466
00:28:48.151 --> 00:28:51.810
See is their pay for performance and Netflix are not really,

467
00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:55.410
there's high performance.
Okay.

468
00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:59.700
So you're going to be paid top dollar for doing a fabulous job with amazing

469
00:28:59.701 --> 00:29:03.960
people on time with quality.
Okay,
so we're going to just pay there.

470
00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:07.170
We're not going to pay like what you did an okay job.

471
00:29:07.171 --> 00:29:11.010
So I'm going to give you an okay raise if you did an okay job,

472
00:29:11.011 --> 00:29:13.560
we're going to talk about weather where you're at and whether or not you still

473
00:29:13.561 --> 00:29:15.270
need to be there.
Right?

474
00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:20.010
And then how I determine what pay is his market,
what do you were somewhere else.

475
00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:24.510
I listened to his true story.
I would say to my vice presidents,

476
00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:29.790
go interview at Google.
They're like,
no one knew.
What are you talking about?

477
00:29:29.791 --> 00:29:33.030
I'm love it here.
I'm like,
no,
no,
no God's.
And they're like shit.
And Google,

478
00:29:33.031 --> 00:29:35.100
it takes like seven weeks and five.
I'm like,

479
00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:39.060
I want to know what they're paying VBS.
This is good to go.
Go ahead of you.

480
00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.040
I would tell my my employees,

481
00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:44.350
look when the recruiter calls before you say no thanks,

482
00:29:44.351 --> 00:29:48.760
be sure you say how much and come down on me.
Cause that's,

483
00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:53.140
that's real comp data.
Real comp data is what was,
somebody else will pay you.

484
00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:59.950
So it's not just paying people a lot and it's not just paying people for

485
00:29:59.951 --> 00:30:02.590
performance.
It's almost the opposite.

486
00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:06.370
It's expecting extraordinary performance and paying you well for the

487
00:30:06.371 --> 00:30:07.420
extraordinary work.

488
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:13.470
And then the other thing is not all jobs are equal and not all jobs are equally

489
00:30:14.351 --> 00:30:17.680
as important to the company.
So I'm doing,
I do also,

490
00:30:17.681 --> 00:30:22.330
so I tend to talk to like big companies now and lots of startups.

491
00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:27.070
So startup CEO Dinner,
I'm up in the city and one guy says,

492
00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:31.270
well,
you know your high performance thing,

493
00:30:31.271 --> 00:30:36.250
you don't really mean everybody.
And I said,
yeah,

494
00:30:36.251 --> 00:30:39.250
I do.
I mean everybody,
you should have a high performer in every job.
And he goes,

495
00:30:39.251 --> 00:30:43.630
yeah,
but not the ones that aren't important.
And I said,
well,
really,

496
00:30:43.631 --> 00:30:47.290
which job at your company is not important?
He goes,
well,
you know,
like,

497
00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:53.350
like payroll or something.
I said,
seriously,

498
00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:57.190
you know,
when somebody really good figuring out how to pay your really brilliant

499
00:30:57.191 --> 00:31:01.810
engineers,
who I'm sure are the ones that are really important.
And he goes,
well,

500
00:31:01.811 --> 00:31:05.470
I'm just saying,
I'm like,
you don't want them to be accurate.
He's like,
well,

501
00:31:05.471 --> 00:31:08.710
it's just,
they don't have to be like,
yes they do.
They have to be really great.

502
00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:13.420
And they said,
hey,
by the way,
tip for you.
Your finance organization hates you.

503
00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:19.150
And he goes,
I don't think you know my finance organization.
I'm like,

504
00:31:19.151 --> 00:31:22.630
Oh hell yeah I do.
You just told me a perfect stranger.

505
00:31:22.631 --> 00:31:25.240
You think your payroll supervisor is stupid.

506
00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:30.280
They know you think they're all stupid cause they can't write code.

507
00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:35.710
Right.
It's a completely different skill set and the egg.
And furthermore,

508
00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:38.830
when you're not looking,
they're thinking of ways to torture you

509
00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:43.540
because that's what finance people do.

510
00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:51.310
So yeah,
I don't,
the pay for performance thing works.
When you're,

511
00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:54.610
you know,
you,
what you do is valuable,
then you should pay a lot for it.

512
00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:01.230
<v 0>Do you want to yell or hit cons faster?</v>

513
00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:09.250
<v 2>So how do you build a culture of excellence like that without also creating a</v>

514
00:32:10.521 --> 00:32:15.410
culture of fear and ego and toxicity if like,
you know,

515
00:32:15.411 --> 00:32:16.400
like,
well,

516
00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:21.380
fear is a hard one to get rid of because part of it is adrenaline.

517
00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:26.240
So I remember one time one of our executives was talking,
one of them was,

518
00:32:26.241 --> 00:32:29.000
he was talking about that this particular year,

519
00:32:29.001 --> 00:32:31.820
the things that we're going to do and succeed at,

520
00:32:31.821 --> 00:32:34.370
we're not going to be incremental.
They were going to be monumental.

521
00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:39.470
And he used climbing k two as this metaphor,
right?
Here we are.

522
00:32:39.471 --> 00:32:41.030
And so at the end,
um,

523
00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:45.230
this had been a big culture of fear was the new meme around the company where at

524
00:32:45.231 --> 00:32:49.160
this executive meeting.
And um,
it was a bigger meeting,
quarterly business review,

525
00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:51.290
and at the end read and I get,
go to the front,

526
00:32:51.291 --> 00:32:53.660
we're answering questions and he says,
oh,
I want to hear you.

527
00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:57.710
And Patty talked about the culture of fear.
I'm like,
oh,
for God's sake,
really?

528
00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:01.190
So read says,
well,
you know,
you just use the metaphor of k two,

529
00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:05.360
you have to have oxygen,
you know,
and if you get,

530
00:33:05.361 --> 00:33:09.710
if you get halfway up and a blizzard comes in,
you go back down to base camp,

531
00:33:09.711 --> 00:33:14.060
there's no shame.
This is,
you know,
this isn't for the timid.

532
00:33:15.290 --> 00:33:19.220
So you know,
the toxicity and the ego's,

533
00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:23.270
those people just don't need to work there anymore.
Right.
Somebody,

534
00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:27.440
Scott just ferret that out,
right?
And you have to,

535
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:28.400
that's why,

536
00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:33.700
that's why the culture of honesty is so important so that I can say to you,

537
00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:37.970
Hey,
wait a minute,
um,
excuse me,

538
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.310
but in this meeting she's still talking and you just cut her off.
Okay,
so,

539
00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:46.880
so can you let her finish.
Thanks.
And then you do,
and she lives in,

540
00:33:46.881 --> 00:33:51.290
life goes on.
You have to model the right behavior.
You have to be able to say,

541
00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:54.590
that was a jerk.
Move right there buddy.

542
00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:59.090
And I mean,
you just have to be able to have those conversations.

543
00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:02.030
It's the schist spring that gets us in trouble.
You know,

544
00:34:02.031 --> 00:34:07.031
talking shit in a whisper s that's toxic.

545
00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:14.360
Right?
And if,
and you can be in my book,
there's a chapter about debate.

546
00:34:14.450 --> 00:34:18.170
We loved debate,
uh,
on behalf of the customer,

547
00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:22.220
on behalf of the customer,
on behalf of the customer.

548
00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:27.250
And you can be pretty worked up when you're talking about the product.

549
00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:31.640
I used to tell my HR team,
we are a service organization.

550
00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:35.960
It is not spelleds e R v,
a n t,
s

551
00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:41.890
and the people that we serve don't work here,
right?

552
00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:45.070
The people that we serve,
our moms and our neighbors and ourselves.

553
00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:49.960
So it's our job to put together teams that build incredible stuff.

554
00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:52.720
You know,
when I talked to my name,
I've been gone six years.

555
00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:55.840
So it's a long time and Netflix is a very different company now.

556
00:34:55.870 --> 00:35:00.820
Netflix is a global original content company and what's very successful for them

557
00:35:00.821 --> 00:35:04.780
now as they've extended that culture of freedom and responsibility to the

558
00:35:04.781 --> 00:35:08.440
creative talent,
that's why they get the people they get right?

559
00:35:08.441 --> 00:35:13.090
That's why Shonda Rhimes wants to work at Netflix and not at ABC because

560
00:35:13.091 --> 00:35:14.740
nobody's walking around and telling her what to do.

561
00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:21.090
It was a hand over the mic.
And then second,
just just think like how do that,

562
00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:25.740
does it,
does it create a culture of like competition?

563
00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:29.793
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

564
00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:34.390
<v 2>No,
because remember how I started with team,
right?</v>

565
00:35:34.391 --> 00:35:38.400
So the thing about the individual competing individuals,

566
00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:43.560
that shouldn't happen when you have a larger collective thing to do,

567
00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:47.790
right?
I mean it might happen for you guys because you have more products,

568
00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.060
but you know,
these teams teams are,

569
00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:55.330
are formed to focus on solving a particular problem in a particular timeframe.

570
00:35:56.210 --> 00:36:00.540
And,
and teams are formed to do that because individuals can't

571
00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:05.130
or they can't.
That's the deal.
That's the,
I tell you know,

572
00:36:05.131 --> 00:36:09.150
back when I talked to startup guys again,
I'm like,
okay,
in your little startup,

573
00:36:09.151 --> 00:36:12.030
here's the first sign of trouble.
Nostalgia.

574
00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:17.100
Remember how it used to be,
right?
And I tell them like,

575
00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:22.280
really successful companies are not made of 50 people working 24 seven it's not

576
00:36:22.281 --> 00:36:25.860
about product.
It's solving goes to groups that are solving probably functional.

577
00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:29.370
That's right.
Group solving problems that are clear to everybody.

578
00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:34.170
So everybody has a role.
So when people are competing thin,
what is,

579
00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:38.310
what are they competing for?
Is it one meaty job and you've got two people.

580
00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:42.060
That's what drives competition.
Is it that,
um,

581
00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:45.450
you know that in the end there's only one job and there's four people trying to

582
00:36:45.451 --> 00:36:49.740
get it instead of just picking one?
I,
it's,

583
00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:52.350
it goes back to honesty I think.
All right.

584
00:36:52.351 --> 00:36:55.900
We'll do two more questions over there I think and then over here.
Okay.
Awesome.

585
00:36:56.510 --> 00:37:00.740
<v 5>Um,
thank you very much.
How she read the book.
Oh,
this amazing book.</v>

586
00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:02.350
Thank you very much for the book.
Um,

587
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:06.680
one big impression I actually got from the book is a one of a major components

588
00:37:06.681 --> 00:37:08.510
for nefarious.
You sustain such a culture.

589
00:37:08.511 --> 00:37:11.930
Our motto is to have a very powerful and strong recruiting team.
Yes.

590
00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:16.060
And the HR department was,
um,
my question is,
um,

591
00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:19.010
I guess for a smaller company,

592
00:37:19.011 --> 00:37:21.740
maybe a star up or even Netflix in his early days,

593
00:37:21.741 --> 00:37:25.310
where are they recruiting worthy recruiting or HR is not as strong as it is

594
00:37:25.311 --> 00:37:30.180
right now.
Yeah.
Um,
is such a,
is social culture of sustainable?

595
00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:33.060
<v 2>Well since you read the book,
you know that the,</v>

596
00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:37.440
the other secret of the great recruiting team at Netflix is that it's not the

597
00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:42.480
great recruiting's team's job to recruit people.
It's everybody's.
And,

598
00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:47.540
and the number one job of a hiring manager is to know the right talent to build

599
00:37:47.641 --> 00:37:51.120
an amazing team that gets quality work done on time.
Okay.

600
00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:55.020
And so I used to say,
I'll tell you this one last story.
Uh,

601
00:37:55.021 --> 00:37:57.720
back in the day when I was a software engineering recruiter,

602
00:37:57.721 --> 00:38:01.110
I studied the habits of software engineers.

603
00:38:01.111 --> 00:38:06.111
And so I happened to know that there's always that weird ethnic restaurant in a

604
00:38:06.631 --> 00:38:10.140
strip mall that is the place does your,
that you eat,

605
00:38:10.141 --> 00:38:12.870
this is before we all had restaurants all over our campuses,
right?

606
00:38:12.871 --> 00:38:16.980
So I'd go find that little Thai place in Cupertino and,
and you know,
and the,

607
00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:20.490
on the,
in the lobby,
they'd have like the Fishbowl,
you put your business card in,

608
00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:21.900
you get a free lunch.

609
00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:24.450
Do you guys still go to those funky little strip mall joints?

610
00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:29.460
And I go and I just take the fishbowl and I go to the back and dump it out.

611
00:38:29.461 --> 00:38:32.580
And this isn't in the old days before cell phones,
right?
And I just dump it out,

612
00:38:32.581 --> 00:38:35.710
write down all the names and go back to work and call them all because it was

613
00:38:35.711 --> 00:38:37.120
where all the software engineers work.

614
00:38:37.121 --> 00:38:39.640
And now I say that's why God gave us linkedin now.

615
00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:44.800
So you can do that.
You should be looking for members of your team all the time.

616
00:38:44.801 --> 00:38:45.880
It's everybody's job.

617
00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:50.080
It's Hr job to facilitate it and to really understand what the market is and

618
00:38:50.081 --> 00:38:54.100
where to go get people.
But it's everybody's job to bring great,
talented,

619
00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:55.210
and that's the difference.

620
00:38:55.211 --> 00:38:59.680
It's not just a great recruiting team and migrate recruiting team was and is so

621
00:38:59.681 --> 00:39:03.370
great there because they feel like they're partners in bringing in talent.

622
00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:05.140
They're not recruiters in HR.

623
00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:07.843
<v 0>Do you have question?</v>

624
00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:10.970
<v 2>Hi Betty.</v>

625
00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:15.110
My question is how do you evaluate or think of high performance in the context

626
00:39:15.111 --> 00:39:18.800
of very ambitious and risky projects that didn't go well?

627
00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:22.670
Well,
I think you figure out what you wanted to,
you know,

628
00:39:22.671 --> 00:39:26.690
you do it like any other software product,
I've any other product,

629
00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:31.460
you postmortem it right when it didn't go well,
you stop and say,
you know,
you,

630
00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:34.250
you pause and you get the team together and say,

631
00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:37.880
what should we have done differently?
Right?
Did we miss scope it?

632
00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:40.460
Did we miss the,
uh,

633
00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:45.050
did we miss the readiness of the product for the customer?
Did we put,

634
00:39:45.110 --> 00:39:49.430
was it the wrong team where we unclear about goals?
So I mean,

635
00:39:49.431 --> 00:39:54.260
everything I learned about people I learned from product managers,
right?

636
00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:57.050
You start with the end and you work your way back,
right?

637
00:39:57.051 --> 00:39:59.300
What are we trying to accomplish?
What's it going to look like?

638
00:39:59.301 --> 00:40:01.700
What's quality look like?
When's the delivery date?

639
00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:04.850
That's the other thing we don't do very well is put time rappers on stuff.

640
00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:09.020
So it's like,
so yeah,
we accomplish it,
but it was six months late.

641
00:40:09.021 --> 00:40:13.520
What w what should we have known when we made that date at the beginning that we

642
00:40:13.521 --> 00:40:17.180
didn't know now?
So that's the part about,
you talked about development.

643
00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:21.680
That's the continuous learning part that I think all of us should do as teams.

644
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:27.470
Makes Sense.
Okay.
All right.
Well thank you,
Patty.
Thank you everyone.

645
00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:28.760
<v 0>How many?
Let's give them already.</v>
