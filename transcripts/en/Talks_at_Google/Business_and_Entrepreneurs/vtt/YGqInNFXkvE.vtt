00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.100
Good afternoon.

2
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.870
My name is Heathrow and I'm a research operations manager on the insights lab

3
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.190
part of brand studio.
And we're here today for a talk by Gloria Mark.

4
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.450
Gloria mark is a professor in the Department of Informatics at the University of

5
00:00:20.451 --> 00:00:25.451
California in Irvine and her research focuses on how the use of technology

6
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.180
affects our lives in real world contexts.

7
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.370
She received her phd in psychology from Columbia University and before working

8
00:00:34.371 --> 00:00:39.371
at Uci she worked at the German National Research Center for Information

9
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.060
Technology and has served as a visiting researcher at Microsoft research since

10
00:00:44.061 --> 00:00:48.500
2012 as well as IBM and the MIT media lab.

11
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.660
Today she's going to talk about her work using sensors,
experience sampling,

12
00:00:53.661 --> 00:00:54.650
computer logging,

13
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.950
and repeated surveys to study the workplace experience specifically how

14
00:01:00.531 --> 00:01:02.600
attention,
focus,
stress,

15
00:01:02.601 --> 00:01:07.601
and effect are impacted by digital media use as well as how our attention focus

16
00:01:08.421 --> 00:01:12.650
varies over the workday.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Gloria.
Mark.

17
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.240
<v 2>Thank you.
So it's,</v>

18
00:01:17.241 --> 00:01:21.980
it's a real pleasure to be here at so far away from Irvine.

19
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.580
So I am really interested in understanding how digital media affects our lives.

20
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.370
And how does this clicker cups?

21
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.430
Okay.

22
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.430
So my starting point is that most people are by nature monochronic.

23
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.300
And what that means is most people like myself prefer to start on a task and

24
00:01:49.671 --> 00:01:53.450
finish it through to completion before switching to something else.

25
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.110
But we live in a digital age and we are required to work in a polychronic way.

26
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.590
So most people have multiple devices.
You work on multiple applications,

27
00:02:05.591 --> 00:02:10.070
you have multiple apps open on your laptop,
does top,

28
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.000
um,

29
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.920
some people have iPads and we're always switching our attention between devices

30
00:02:15.921 --> 00:02:17.150
and applications.

31
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.290
And it forces us to work in a polychronic way.

32
00:02:21.291 --> 00:02:24.200
And that's against what our nature is.

33
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.110
So in particular,

34
00:02:27.111 --> 00:02:32.030
I'm very interested in the idea of multitasking and people sometimes think of

35
00:02:32.031 --> 00:02:35.150
multitasking is working on two things at the same time.

36
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.510
And that's impossible for human beings to literally work on two things at the

37
00:02:40.881 --> 00:02:43.280
same time.
You can walk and Chew Gum,

38
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.090
but this is an unconscious kind of a process.

39
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.450
But what it really refers to is switching very rapidly between different tasks,

40
00:02:53.031 --> 00:02:54.560
between different contexts.

41
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.850
You can think of it like timesharing among computers,
right?

42
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.610
So when we talk about multitasking,
that's really what we're referring to,

43
00:03:03.611 --> 00:03:06.910
this rapid context shifting back and forth.

44
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.470
Now a lot of people have tried to measure multitasking and the most typical way

45
00:03:14.831 --> 00:03:19.690
that is measured as you ask people,
how much do you multitask?
Well,

46
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.720
this is not very fruitful because research has shown that people can be off by

47
00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:30.751
about 30% in their estimates of how much time they spend on computing or just

48
00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:36.490
estimating time.
In general.
People are notoriously bad at estimating time.

49
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.170
You could bring people in a laboratory and you can give them some kind of

50
00:03:41.171 --> 00:03:44.800
artificial task and watch how fast or how well they switch.

51
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.100
But that's artificial and it doesn't begin to model all the kinds of things we

52
00:03:50.201 --> 00:03:53.080
experience in real world work,

53
00:03:53.081 --> 00:03:58.081
like career trajectories and conflicts and social pressures and deadlines and

54
00:03:58.811 --> 00:04:01.180
how tired we feel and so on.

55
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.080
So my perspective is that if we really want to study people and understand them,

56
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.690
we have to go where people are.

57
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.100
So we have to create living laboratories and that's what I do.

58
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:20.200
And if you do this kind of approach,

59
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.290
we can ask questions like how fragmented is our attention with digital media?

60
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.400
How can we explain distraction with digital media?

61
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.020
How does digital media use affect mood?
Because it does.

62
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.880
So let me start off by talking about the introduction of digital media in the

63
00:04:44.081 --> 00:04:47.410
workplace.
So I'm very often as well,
gee,

64
00:04:47.411 --> 00:04:51.730
didn't people always multitask?
You know,
what is new about this?

65
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.970
So let's take a look.
So unfortunately nobody has,
uh,

66
00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:01.630
done any study at the level of detail that we have where we use sensors and

67
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.770
track behavior to the second,
uh,
which I'll talk about shortly.

68
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:11.010
But what people have done is that historically they followed people around in

69
00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:16.711
the workplace and they've timed them to see what their distribution of time is

70
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.750
with different activities.
And if you look here at these,
um,

71
00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.520
the all the,
uh,
the,

72
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.800
the studies that are represented in the two right columns represents studies

73
00:05:32.561 --> 00:05:37.540
that were done when um,
personal computing and email,

74
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:38.350
uh,

75
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:43.350
became widespread in use in the workplace and the studies to the left,

76
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.080
uh,

77
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.000
they were not really in widespread use the study Stevens et Al 1992.

78
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.380
That was sort of mixed.

79
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.880
And I want you to look in particular at how desk work has changed and how

80
00:05:58.011 --> 00:06:03.011
scheduled beaning scheduled meetings refers to formally scheduled face to face

81
00:06:03.741 --> 00:06:04.580
meetings.

82
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:10.040
And I want you to look at these two columns on the right and contrast that with

83
00:06:10.041 --> 00:06:15.041
the work done by the other studies and the Hornen Lupton study in 1965 with

84
00:06:16.281 --> 00:06:18.680
scheduled meetings as a bit of an anomaly.

85
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.260
And tell me if you notice any trends here.
You notice anything?

86
00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.090
What,
what do you notice?
What's changed?

87
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.430
Hut.
Okay.

88
00:06:34.431 --> 00:06:39.170
The amount of time is spent at the desk is increasing.

89
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.100
And what about and meetings are decreasing?

90
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:48.290
So if we put these two
trends together,

91
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.190
right,
we see that proportion of time spent at dusk,

92
00:06:52.191 --> 00:06:56.280
we're nearly doubled with the introduction of uh,

93
00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:01.630
it in the workplace and people spend a less proportion of their time and

94
00:07:01.641 --> 00:07:03.530
scheduled face to face meetings.

95
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:08.950
And this suggests that work that was formally done in face to face meetings is

96
00:07:09.351 --> 00:07:13.010
now being done to a larger extent at the desktop,

97
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.910
through email,
through desktop conferencing,

98
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.800
through other kinds of means.

99
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:24.650
So I'm very fortunate to be interested in this topic,

100
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:25.311
uh,

101
00:07:25.311 --> 00:07:30.050
at the cusp of a revolution in the development of sensor technology,

102
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.520
wearable technologies,
and other kinds of sensor technologies.

103
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:37.190
And so,
you know,

104
00:07:37.191 --> 00:07:42.191
I used to my students and I used to track people in the workplace.

105
00:07:43.641 --> 00:07:48.641
We used to shadow people and we had these timers and every time people would

106
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.630
take a different action,
like pick up the phone,
we would do start time,

107
00:07:53.631 --> 00:07:55.490
they'd put the phone down,
stop time,

108
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.660
and recorded every single action that people dead.
And it was very,

109
00:07:59.661 --> 00:08:00.830
very labor intensive.

110
00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:05.840
But the advantage is that we can understand the context,
right?

111
00:08:05.841 --> 00:08:09.320
So as a byproduct of measuring these activities,

112
00:08:09.321 --> 00:08:13.490
we've got a sense of what people's work life was like.

113
00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:18.920
But when you use sensors,
you miss that context,
right?
You're only,

114
00:08:18.921 --> 00:08:22.970
the sensors are just recording bits of information.

115
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:28.390
And so the grand challenges as I see it is to what extent can we automatically

116
00:08:28.581 --> 00:08:29.780
capture behavior,

117
00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:34.610
was sensors to gain the same level of insights,

118
00:08:34.611 --> 00:08:39.611
the same level of deep knowledge we can about human behavior that we could with

119
00:08:40.941 --> 00:08:43.460
human ethnographic observation.

120
00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:48.050
Ethnographic observation is when people actually follow people around and

121
00:08:48.051 --> 00:08:50.810
observe.
And there's a,

122
00:08:50.811 --> 00:08:55.380
I have several projects that,
uh,
that I've been working on today.

123
00:08:55.381 --> 00:08:59.370
I won't only talk about the health sense project,
which,
uh,

124
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:04.080
which is dealing with information workers.
I have another large star study,

125
00:09:04.081 --> 00:09:05.970
the millennial project,

126
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.170
which tracked college students and their use of digital media.

127
00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:16.190
So let me go through the measures that I use because this is going to help you

128
00:09:16.191 --> 00:09:17.270
understand the data.

129
00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:22.700
So we measure stress using heart rate monitors.
Uh,

130
00:09:22.701 --> 00:09:27.460
we measure electrodermal activity using these devices that are called Affectiva,

131
00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:29.780
Tiva Q sensors.
Uh,

132
00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:34.190
actually these days we're using other wearable devices.
Uh,

133
00:09:34.191 --> 00:09:39.191
we measure people's mood and focus through something called experience sampling.

134
00:09:39.711 --> 00:09:44.711
These are probes that people get where they record their subjective opinion

135
00:09:45.681 --> 00:09:48.740
about something.
And I'm going to talk about that later.

136
00:09:48.741 --> 00:09:53.180
That's in the upper right is an example of what a probe looks like.
A,

137
00:09:53.181 --> 00:09:56.750
we measure face to face interaction with sense cams.

138
00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:00.920
That's this lower rate picture.
It's a,
it's a small little camera,

139
00:10:00.921 --> 00:10:05.540
very lightweight people where it takes continual photos about every 20,

140
00:10:05.541 --> 00:10:06.620
30 seconds.

141
00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:11.870
And then we can apply a phase detection software to see if there was a face

142
00:10:11.871 --> 00:10:15.830
present or not in the image.
And it's very accurate.

143
00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:20.360
We log people's computer and phone activity.
Uh,

144
00:10:20.361 --> 00:10:23.840
we measure people's activity using actographs,

145
00:10:23.841 --> 00:10:28.841
which everyone knows a fitbit as as a common actograph.

146
00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:31.310
We measure sleep,
sleep rhythms,

147
00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:36.610
and we give a whole lot of demographic and personality kinds of measures.

148
00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:44.820
So let me start by giving you an example of what your digital media use can

149
00:10:45.491 --> 00:10:46.840
reveal about you.

150
00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:52.060
Now some people have done this kind of work where they mine the content,

151
00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:56.770
so they analyze the content.
For example,
in social media,
they look at,

152
00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:01.750
they do sentiment analysis to see what kind of words people are using.

153
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:06.820
But if we just look at temporal features,
right?
No content,

154
00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:11.860
but temporal future is like the average amount of time you spend on digital

155
00:11:11.861 --> 00:11:13.270
media,
the dispersion,

156
00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:17.680
are you using it all at one time or using it throughout the day?
Uh,

157
00:11:17.681 --> 00:11:20.620
when is the device on and an off?

158
00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:25.360
How much social media are you using?
Again,
not content,
uh,

159
00:11:25.361 --> 00:11:29.590
what's your rhythm of usage?
Do you have a regular pattern or is it irregular?

160
00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.740
What time of day is it mostly used?

161
00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:36.340
And we find that we can predict personality.

162
00:11:36.341 --> 00:11:41.341
These are the big five personality traits if you're familiar with them.

163
00:11:41.651 --> 00:11:45.190
This is a commonly used measure of personality.

164
00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:50.380
We can predict these traits from temporal features alone with fairly high

165
00:11:50.381 --> 00:11:51.250
accuracy.

166
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:54.633
<v 3>Okay,</v>

167
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:59.680
<v 2>so let's,
uh,
start with,
um,</v>

168
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.830
a question very much related to multitasking,

169
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:07.480
which is how fragmented is people?

170
00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:11.080
Are People's attention in the workplace and by fragmented,

171
00:12:11.081 --> 00:12:13.660
how much do they actually switch?
Context?

172
00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:16.860
<v 3>Okay.
So</v>

173
00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:22.740
<v 2>here is a measure from logging people's computer activity activity.</v>

174
00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:29.020
This is the average duration of time that people spend on any computer screen

175
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:30.460
before switching.

176
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:35.790
And if you look at all computer usage than median length of time is 40 seconds.

177
00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:42.210
That means that every 40 seconds people are switching on average rate while it's

178
00:12:43.301 --> 00:12:45.970
actually the median to another screen.

179
00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.910
That's a very short amount of time.

180
00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:53.620
And if we look at averages of how often people switch within apps,

181
00:12:53.621 --> 00:12:57.940
that means you open up word and then you're opening up other documents within

182
00:12:57.941 --> 00:13:01.150
word or you're surfing the internet.

183
00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:04.060
People switch about 112 times a day.

184
00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:06.250
And switching between Apps,

185
00:13:06.251 --> 00:13:11.251
which is even more of a context shift going from the Internet to a word document

186
00:13:11.921 --> 00:13:12.880
to email,

187
00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:18.100
that's about 261 times a day.
So,

188
00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:20.030
<v 3>okay.</v>

189
00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:23.810
<v 2>Uh,
no this as,
sorry that that is seconds.
But this,</v>

190
00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:28.870
the switches within apps in between apps actually refer to number of instances,

191
00:13:29.781 --> 00:13:34.730
sorry,
sorry about that.
That's uh,
shouldn't,
should be labeled differently.

192
00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:40.450
So people's workday typically is characterized by very short durations of

193
00:13:42.591 --> 00:13:46.340
attention on any computer screen and lots of switching.

194
00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:48.800
There is an assumption made that the,

195
00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:53.600
that when a computer screen is in the forefront and active,

196
00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:57.020
we make an assumption that that's a proxy for attention.

197
00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:00.950
And it's not always the case.
Now we do,

198
00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:02.930
we do have decision rules.

199
00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:06.560
So if a screen comes up really quick and then goes off,

200
00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:09.320
we make this assumption that people's attention,

201
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:13.490
it's not long enough for people to really focus,
right,

202
00:14:13.491 --> 00:14:15.410
to have any kind of meaningful focus.

203
00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:20.620
So we have decision rules where we filter out screens that are just up for,

204
00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:24.950
for very brief moments of time.
So for example,

205
00:14:24.951 --> 00:14:27.740
sometimes people might switch,

206
00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:32.230
click on a web page and then click immediately to something else.

207
00:14:32.231 --> 00:14:35.960
So we disregard that because we,
you know,
we,

208
00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:40.660
we can't expect that people are actually going to,
um,

209
00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:45.380
focus and spend cognitive resources when that shift is so fast.

210
00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:50.620
The median focused ration on any computer screen we find is seconds.

211
00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:59.420
Now we wondered that maybe,
you know,
not everybody has a,

212
00:14:59.421 --> 00:15:04.190
like maybe there are individual differences that can explain focus duration.

213
00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:11.490
And so we hypothesize that the following things would be related to people's,

214
00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:18.070
the amount of time that people would spend focused on any computer screen.
Uh,

215
00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:21.070
neuroticism is a personality trait.

216
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:26.430
It's characterized by people who just can't suppress thoughts that come into

217
00:15:26.831 --> 00:15:27.664
your head.

218
00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:32.560
And people who are highly neurotic generally have short attention spans.

219
00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:33.461
A,

220
00:15:33.461 --> 00:15:38.461
we hypothesize that people who are impulsive would have a shorter attention span

221
00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:43.480
on the computer.
There are two dimensions of impulsivity that we checked.

222
00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:48.340
One is a sense of urgency,
right?
You,
you can't hold yourself back.

223
00:15:48.341 --> 00:15:52.600
You just have to act another dimension,
lack of perseverance,

224
00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:57.580
right?
That people just don't have what it takes to persevere on a task.

225
00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:00.550
People who are susceptible to stress.

226
00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:05.850
And we hypothesize that people who did not sleep to not have a long sleep

227
00:16:06.641 --> 00:16:11.150
durations the night before would have shorter attention,
uh,

228
00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:12.133
durations.

229
00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:17.370
And we also hypothesize that the longer the attention duration on any computer

230
00:16:18.401 --> 00:16:23.401
screen would be associated with a higher assessed productivity at the end of the

231
00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:25.623
day.

232
00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:31.050
And the neuroticism and impulsive urgency hypotheses were supported.

233
00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:37.680
There was strong trend for this sleep and stress hypotheses to be supported and

234
00:16:39.911 --> 00:16:43.030
productivity.
This hypotheses was supportive.

235
00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:51.740
We also did what's called a factor analysis where we put all these variables

236
00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:57.810
into a program to see if there was a latent structure in the variables.

237
00:16:57.811 --> 00:17:02.811
And indeed we found a latent variable that we label lack of control,

238
00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:08.010
which is comprised of people that are high in neuroticism,

239
00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:11.280
who are high in this impulse of urgency,

240
00:17:11.281 --> 00:17:16.200
kind of a variable and people who are susceptible to stress.

241
00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:20.970
And this is predictive.
The more lack of control people have,

242
00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:23.820
the shorter is there focus duration.

243
00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:27.790
And I'm going to come back to this idea of lack of control later.

244
00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:34.320
Now you might be asking,
well,
so what,

245
00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:35.700
so what if I,

246
00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:40.500
you know I switched from excel to word to email,

247
00:17:40.501 --> 00:17:43.770
but what if I'm working on the same project?
Right?

248
00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:47.640
Maybe it doesn't make a difference,
right?
Cause I'm right now I'm just talking,

249
00:17:47.641 --> 00:17:52.641
I'm agnostic to task and I'm just talking about these switches between computer

250
00:17:52.901 --> 00:17:57.480
screens.
So let's go a little bit deeper and let's look at the task level.

251
00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:02.190
This is work that was done by a former student of mine,

252
00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:03.360
Victor Gonzalez,

253
00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:08.580
with great effort who categorized people's BS,

254
00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.610
smaller actions into,
you know,

255
00:18:11.611 --> 00:18:16.611
clustering them into different tasks and took him a great deal of time.

256
00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:20.670
And here's what he found that first of all,

257
00:18:20.671 --> 00:18:23.970
people work in an average of about 12 different projects.

258
00:18:23.971 --> 00:18:26.730
We call these working spheres,
spheres of work.

259
00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:32.330
And people spend about 10 and a half minutes in any of these working spheres

260
00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:36.390
before switching to something else.

261
00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:41.670
So 10 and a half minutes is not a really long period of time.

262
00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:42.960
And I know,
you know,

263
00:18:42.961 --> 00:18:47.961
I'm an academic and I write papers and 10 and a half minutes is not a very long

264
00:18:48.751 --> 00:18:53.730
time for me to get sufficiently deep into beginning a task.

265
00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:55.200
And then I'm switching.

266
00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:02.400
So let's look at rhythms of attention over the day.

267
00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:09.140
So I want to give you a little bit of psychology theory.

268
00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:10.340
Uh,

269
00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:15.340
so there's a number of researchers who've talked about this idea of attention

270
00:19:15.471 --> 00:19:18.170
focus,
and it goes by different names.

271
00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:22.250
It goes by the term cognitive absorption.

272
00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.250
Others have called it cognitive engagement.

273
00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:30.020
How many of you have heard of mindfulness?
Okay,
you're living in La,

274
00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:34.440
you know about mindfulness,
how many of you have heard of flow?
Okay?

275
00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:39.580
Flo is the idea that you're so deeply immersed with your attention that you

276
00:19:40.221 --> 00:19:42.950
become completely unaware of the passage of time.

277
00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:48.320
So all of these ideas are related.
And then in contrast,

278
00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.540
people speak about boredom.

279
00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:56.720
And the research shows that all of these different constructs related to

280
00:19:57.601 --> 00:20:01.230
attention are associated with positive effect.

281
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:05.040
People are happy when they're deeply immersed and engaged,

282
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.850
and when they're bored,
generally people are not happy.

283
00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.430
And that's what the research studies show.

284
00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:18.090
So here's how you might conceptualize attention being highly engaged or not

285
00:20:20.561 --> 00:20:25.390
engaged in some activity,
right?
That's a simple continuum.

286
00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:31.260
And so we thought about this and we hypothesized that there would be an

287
00:20:31.301 --> 00:20:34.900
orthogonal dimension that we call challenge.

288
00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:40.560
And we came up with this idea because the concept of flow involves challenge

289
00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:44.060
when people are in a state of flow,
right?
They're all well,

290
00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:46.450
they're also challenged to some degree.

291
00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:52.500
And so we came up with this conceptual framework and we put labels on these.

292
00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:59.020
Let me explain them.
So people who are highly engaged and highly challenged,

293
00:20:59.021 --> 00:21:00.850
we use a label of focus.

294
00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:05.740
This is when people are in a state of focus and if people are really engaged in

295
00:21:05.741 --> 00:21:08.680
something,
but they're not at all challenged,

296
00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:11.590
we call this rote as in rote work.

297
00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:16.630
An example is playing solitaire,
right?
When people play solitaire,

298
00:21:16.631 --> 00:21:19.720
you're really engaged but you're not challenged.

299
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:22.870
And the other,
uh,

300
00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:27.900
label board is when you're not at all challenged and you're just not engaged.

301
00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:33.970
We label that board.
And the last one is being challenged in something,

302
00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:38.570
but you're not engaged.
We call that frustrated is just a label.
A,

303
00:21:38.571 --> 00:21:43.300
an example would be a software developer who has a bug.
They're just really,

304
00:21:43.301 --> 00:21:44.410
really frustrated.

305
00:21:44.411 --> 00:21:48.700
They're challenged by it and they're just can't engage themselves into trying to

306
00:21:48.701 --> 00:21:49.534
work it out.

307
00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:54.370
I mentioned that this is the probe that we used.

308
00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:57.400
So we gave people these,
uh,

309
00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:01.390
probes throughout the day on the average about 18 times a day.

310
00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:04.910
People were asked that the top part is,
uh,

311
00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:08.980
called Russell circumplex model of mood.
Uh,
it's,

312
00:22:08.981 --> 00:22:13.300
it's a well validated measure of moods,
self reported mood.

313
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:17.740
And the bottom we asked people how engaged were you in the thing you were just

314
00:22:17.741 --> 00:22:21.310
doing and how challenged where you and the thing you were just doing.

315
00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:26.790
People were trained in this and they were able to answer these probes about it

316
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:30.040
within a few seconds.
Uh,

317
00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:33.880
these probes came about 18 times a day.

318
00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:39.300
And the irony is not lost on me that we're interrupting people 18 times a day,

319
00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:44.440
but we got really great data and people submit this.

320
00:22:44.441 --> 00:22:48.160
We get a timestamp and we can align the timestamps.

321
00:22:48.161 --> 00:22:52.180
So we see what people's subjective moods and,
uh,

322
00:22:52.181 --> 00:22:57.181
engagement and challenges in relation to the computer activities that they're

323
00:22:57.611 --> 00:23:02.530
doing.
And we also look at stress and we have other metros.

324
00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:08.650
So in contrast to what all this other research shows that people are happiest

325
00:23:08.651 --> 00:23:09.670
when they're engaged,

326
00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:15.060
we actually find that the mean level of happiness is highest when people are

327
00:23:15.431 --> 00:23:20.260
doing rote work.
So when people are doing this kind of mindless work,

328
00:23:20.261 --> 00:23:24.610
you're engaged,
but you're just not using your mental resources.

329
00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:28.990
That's when people are the happiest.
So if we slice up this,

330
00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:29.711
uh,

331
00:23:29.711 --> 00:23:34.660
this idea of engagement and attention and we slice it up in terms of being

332
00:23:34.661 --> 00:23:38.020
challenged and not challenged,
we find there is a difference.

333
00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:41.980
People are least happiest when they're bored.
And you're saying,

334
00:23:41.981 --> 00:23:44.080
why are there data aligns with frustrated?

335
00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:48.470
That's because hardly anyone in our sample reported being frustrated.

336
00:23:48.471 --> 00:23:52.400
So we didn't have enough data to,
to make any conclusions.

337
00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:53.533
<v 3>That's</v>

338
00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:59.280
<v 2>this is what the average attention,
uh,</v>

339
00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:02.520
looks like over the course of the day.
Uh,

340
00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:06.750
the black line is focused and there's a couple of interesting things about this

341
00:24:06.751 --> 00:24:07.584
graph.

342
00:24:07.650 --> 00:24:12.300
So people are at their peak focus in the morning,

343
00:24:12.301 --> 00:24:17.301
about 11:00 AM so late morning and also roughly about 3:00 PM.

344
00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:21.420
Uh,
and what's also interesting,

345
00:24:21.421 --> 00:24:26.421
at least for me is that people don't come into the workplace ramped up and ready

346
00:24:27.361 --> 00:24:32.100
to go,
but it takes some time to ease into,
uh,

347
00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:34.590
into a deeper attentional state.

348
00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:37.840
<v 3>Okay.</v>

349
00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:39.940
<v 2>Let's talk about distractions.</v>

350
00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:40.993
<v 3>It's</v>

351
00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.760
<v 2>so first one of,
um,
an,</v>

352
00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:50.840
an interesting idea about interruptions is we always think of interruptions in

353
00:24:51.131 --> 00:24:55.220
terms of external notification,
right?
You,

354
00:24:55.221 --> 00:25:00.221
you get an email notification or social media notification or a colleague comes

355
00:25:00.521 --> 00:25:03.370
into the office or you get a phone ringing.

356
00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:08.640
But there's this other phenomenon called in we call internal interruptions or

357
00:25:08.741 --> 00:25:09.850
self interruptions.

358
00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:15.070
The best way I can describe it is you're observing someone and they're typing in

359
00:25:15.071 --> 00:25:17.530
a word doc and for no apparent reason,

360
00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:22.600
they suddenly stop what they're doing and they turn and pick up the phone or

361
00:25:22.601 --> 00:25:25.750
they stop and they check email or social media.

362
00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:29.350
That's a self interruption.
I know I do it.

363
00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:31.660
Since I've been doing this research,

364
00:25:31.661 --> 00:25:35.530
I became much more aware of how much I do at now.

365
00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:40.680
We type the data and we divided it up into our lease segments and we looked at

366
00:25:41.951 --> 00:25:42.940
the,
um,

367
00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:48.790
the proportion of external and the internal interruptions in each of those

368
00:25:48.791 --> 00:25:53.410
hourly segments throughout the day,
over the course of a days.

369
00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:58.920
And we found something really interesting that when external interruptions

370
00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:00.550
waned,

371
00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:06.360
we saw that internal interruptions kicked in and started to become high.

372
00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:12.190
It's not that when an external interruptions stop that people suddenly had piece

373
00:26:12.191 --> 00:26:15.460
of mind and we're able to work without interruptions.

374
00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:19.870
They began to interrupt themselves.
That's what the data showed.

375
00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:25.170
And this suggests to me that people are conditioned to be interrupted,

376
00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:30.640
to work in very short attention spans.

377
00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:35.910
And if you're not being interrupted by external sources than people will

378
00:26:36.221 --> 00:26:40.150
interrupt themselves.
And that would be a sign of being conditioned.

379
00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:44.370
<v 3>Okay.
Now</v>

380
00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.510
<v 2>distractions.
There is this,
um,
you know,</v>

381
00:26:48.511 --> 00:26:53.511
a lot of work has been done in interruptions and people have assumed in this

382
00:26:54.511 --> 00:26:57.210
work that people are,
you know,

383
00:26:57.450 --> 00:26:59.550
really absorbed in their work.

384
00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:04.850
And then along comes a distraction and all of a sudden people get bored,

385
00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:05.281
right?

386
00:27:05.281 --> 00:27:09.570
Along comes as social media distraction and then it takes you away from this

387
00:27:09.571 --> 00:27:14.130
deep engagement.
Well,
what if it's the reverse?

388
00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:19.940
What if people are first in a state of boredom and that makes them susceptible

389
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:26.340
to a distraction?
And so that's the question we asked.

390
00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:28.260
So first,
uh,

391
00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:31.800
let me tell you a little bit about types of interruptions.

392
00:27:31.801 --> 00:27:36.801
So workplace communications comprise 40% of interruptions.

393
00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:42.690
Uh,
there's an email.
These are the,
these are the top,
uh,
offenders.

394
00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:48.150
Uh,
email is primarily work related,
at least in the workplace as we studied.

395
00:27:48.151 --> 00:27:53.151
They were face to face can be either work related or social and faced Facebook,

396
00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:59.510
which was the main social media platform used in the particular company we

397
00:27:59.611 --> 00:28:02.160
studied.
That's primarily social.

398
00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:09.210
And to give you an idea of the extent to how much,

399
00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:09.470
you know,

400
00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:14.470
how often and how much people spend on these types of communications.

401
00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:19.980
We see people in our sample visited Facebook about 21 times a day.

402
00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:23.280
Email checked about 74 times a day.

403
00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:27.540
The high person in our sample was about 465 times a day.

404
00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:32.280
Uh,
but people spend relatively short durations of time.

405
00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:37.760
They check Facebook but then spend about 18 seconds on it and email,

406
00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:44.720
you know,
they check it off in but spend just about 32 seconds.
So they don't it.

407
00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:49.770
This is the typical profile of the information worker who we studied.

408
00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:55.740
And here's what we find.
When we looked at the data,
we found,
you know,

409
00:28:55.741 --> 00:29:00.570
based on this experience sampling from the probes that when people were in a

410
00:29:00.571 --> 00:29:02.100
state of focus,

411
00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:07.490
they spent significantly longer on email compared to the other states and the

412
00:29:08.911 --> 00:29:12.000
other communications types.
Uh,

413
00:29:12.001 --> 00:29:17.001
when people were either bored or in a state of wrote doing rote work,

414
00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:22.850
they spent significantly longer doing face to face interaction after and when

415
00:29:24.121 --> 00:29:26.010
people were in a state of rote work,

416
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:30.480
it was followed significantly by longer duration of Facebook use.

417
00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:35.960
And the way to interpret this data is that people first adopt particular

418
00:29:37.651 --> 00:29:41.250
attentional states,
particular states of mind,

419
00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:46.470
which make them susceptible to particular kinds of interaction.

420
00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.850
Let's talk about email.

421
00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:56.810
So it took me six years to find a field site that was willing to let itself be

422
00:29:57.841 --> 00:29:59.650
cut off,
uh,

423
00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:03.900
to have its employees be cut off by email for a workweek.

424
00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:09.290
And the reason we wanted to study this was to see can we create an environment

425
00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:14.610
where people would have less interruptions,
couldn't they focus longer?

426
00:30:15.050 --> 00:30:15.883
<v 3>Right?</v>

427
00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:23.420
<v 2>And so here's what we found.
We had people in this workplace,
uh,</v>

428
00:30:23.421 --> 00:30:28.421
we measured them in their baseline condition and then we cut off their email for

429
00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:34.310
a work week and we have them wear heart rate monitors,
which is,

430
00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:36.770
provides a measure of heart rate variability.

431
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:41.090
It's the variability of the distance between consecutive heartbeats.

432
00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:44.480
And we find that without email,

433
00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:50.050
people spent significantly longer duration of focus on any computer screen.

434
00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:55.790
Uh,
and then the flip side,
if you want to look at the data from,
uh,
the flip side,

435
00:30:55.791 --> 00:31:00.070
you can see that they switched about half as often.
Uh,

436
00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:04.850
now heart rate variability revealed that people were significantly less
stressed.

437
00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:08.280
You're looking at that number and you're saying,
wait a minute,
it's higher.
What,

438
00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:11.330
how can that be?
That's because,
uh,

439
00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:16.360
the higher the variability of people's heart rate intervals,

440
00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:20.910
they intervals between the beats,
uh,
the more relaxed people are.

441
00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:25.760
And that's because the least little bit of stimulus will cause you to jump

442
00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:29.540
right?
And it creates higher variability.
You're really stressed.

443
00:31:29.541 --> 00:31:33.740
You're in this fight or flight kind of syndrome.
You know,

444
00:31:33.741 --> 00:31:38.060
the bear is chasing you ready to run and you're a heartbeat's are more regular.

445
00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:42.450
So we find longer focus and we find,
um,

446
00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:45.020
people are less stressed without email.

447
00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:53.150
Let's talk about workplace mood and social interactions.

448
00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:57.170
So there's two ways to think,

449
00:31:57.171 --> 00:32:00.710
to measure workplace mood.
So,
first of all,

450
00:32:00.711 --> 00:32:05.711
we wanted to see if people's face to face interaction would produce a different

451
00:32:07.731 --> 00:32:12.380
kind of mood in the workplace.
Then online,
uh,
social interactions.
And again,

452
00:32:12.381 --> 00:32:16.810
as I mentioned,
Facebook was the most common,
uh,
uh,

453
00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:19.550
platform used in this company.

454
00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:24.050
There's two ways of looking at this at the time they occur,
right?

455
00:32:24.051 --> 00:32:27.560
What makes people happier?
And so let me ask you,

456
00:32:27.561 --> 00:32:32.240
how many of you think at the time they occur face to face interactions,

457
00:32:32.241 --> 00:32:36.230
make people happier than Facebook?
How many of you'd think,

458
00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:38.240
okay,

459
00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:43.240
how many of think that Facebook doing of Facebook interaction makes people

460
00:32:43.251 --> 00:32:48.110
happier?
Okay,
the answer is face to face.

461
00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:49.760
Um,

462
00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:54.760
we can also look at those at the end of the day because this is really important

463
00:32:55.071 --> 00:32:59.390
because the mood people have at the end of the day carries over into their

464
00:32:59.391 --> 00:33:02.540
personal lives.
So this is really important to look at.

465
00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:08.200
How many of you think the more time spent on Facebook is associated with a

466
00:33:08.931 --> 00:33:11.150
happier mood at the end of the day?

467
00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:13.180
<v 3>Okay.</v>

468
00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:16.120
<v 2>How many of you think the more time,
wait,
sorry.</v>

469
00:33:16.121 --> 00:33:20.320
Did I say face to face men to say faith.

470
00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:21.910
How many think face to face?

471
00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:27.240
The more time spent in face to face interaction at the workplace is associated

472
00:33:27.941 --> 00:33:31.540
with happier mood at the end of the day.
Okay.

473
00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:36.990
And how many of you think the more time spent on Facebook is associated with a

474
00:33:37.301 --> 00:33:39.190
happier mood?
At the end of the day,

475
00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:43.360
we have one person and one person.

476
00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:47.410
You are correct.
It is Facebook.

477
00:33:47.411 --> 00:33:49.810
The more time people spend on Facebook.

478
00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:54.850
Now why would that be the case?
Right?
It's counterintuitive.

479
00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:56.283
Well,

480
00:33:56.290 --> 00:34:01.290
we dug into the data and we found that when people spent more time on Facebook,

481
00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:05.920
they were also more engaged in their work for that day.

482
00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:10.810
And now it makes sense because if you're really working,

483
00:34:10.811 --> 00:34:15.130
you're really focused and engaged in your work.
Uh,

484
00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:17.980
the last thing you want to have as a face to face interaction,

485
00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:21.010
because when you have a face to face interaction,

486
00:34:21.011 --> 00:34:23.770
you're a prisoner of that interaction,
right?

487
00:34:23.771 --> 00:34:28.240
You have the greeting ritual and the attraction and the partying ritual,

488
00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:30.580
and you can't just break away very quickly.

489
00:34:30.970 --> 00:34:34.540
But with Facebook you can do what we call grazing behavior.

490
00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:39.550
You can move in and out pretty quickly,
right under your control.

491
00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:43.780
And so that's why we think when people were engaged in their work,

492
00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:46.320
Facebook offers them away to,

493
00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:50.320
to do grazing behavior to take breaks under their control.

494
00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:58.100
So what about if we block distractions?

495
00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:59.210
What happens?

496
00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:04.640
Is it a good strategy to block distractions?

497
00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:09.670
Everybody complains about distractions from digital media and there's not just a

498
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:18.190
plethora of commercial apps that are developed to enable people to block

499
00:35:19.461 --> 00:35:24.140
distractions.
Two basic approaches.
One is you just simply cut off,

500
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:28.160
uh,
sites that people feel would be distracting.

501
00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:32.900
And the other approach is that you show people the amount of time they spend on

502
00:35:32.901 --> 00:35:35.900
different sites to increase their awareness,
right?

503
00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:39.840
With the idea that if people become aware how much time they spend on social

504
00:35:39.841 --> 00:35:43.470
media,
they might take action to change.

505
00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:49.080
So we did a field study,
32 information workers.
Uh,

506
00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:54.090
we looked around for a commercial software to use.
We found freedom software,

507
00:35:54.091 --> 00:35:58.050
which seems like a pretty good choice.
Um,

508
00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:02.130
we measured people five days baseline the way they work normally.

509
00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:06.360
And then five days they worked.
They were told to work as they normally would,

510
00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:11.580
but they use this freedom blocking software to block distractions.

511
00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:16.590
We let people choose what distractions they wanted to,

512
00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:17.850
um,
to block.

513
00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:23.070
It comes with a default list of distractions and then people could personalize

514
00:36:23.071 --> 00:36:26.580
it according to what they felt was most distracting for them.

515
00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:31.440
We used a scale that's called cognitive absorption,

516
00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:36.060
which has the following dimensions.
These are all related to the eye,

517
00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:37.920
the idea of focusing.

518
00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:42.240
And we found that when distractions were cut off,

519
00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:47.750
people's focused immersion in their task increased significantly.

520
00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:51.420
Temporal dissociation,
discrete,

521
00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:56.580
decreased temporal dissociation is,
is being unaware of time.

522
00:36:57.030 --> 00:37:01.380
People became more aware of time when,
uh,

523
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:06.210
distractions were blocked.
There was no difference in people's sense of control,

524
00:37:06.211 --> 00:37:08.160
which totally surprised us.

525
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:12.810
We thought there wouldn't be and peoples' enjoyment decreased while we took away

526
00:37:12.811 --> 00:37:16.800
people's social media and there was no difference in curiosity.

527
00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:21.070
Another dimension,
a focus increased.
Uh,

528
00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:23.460
we interviewed everyone.
Two main reasons.

529
00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:26.370
We removed what's called attention residue.

530
00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:28.620
That's the idea of let's say you go on Facebook,

531
00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:32.430
you become involved in the content and that content stays with you.

532
00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:36.810
And when you switch back to your task,
he was still thinking about Facebook.

533
00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:41.310
We took that residue away,
we stopped chains of distraction.

534
00:37:41.311 --> 00:37:46.050
People report just rabbit holing,
they go onto the internet and then they just,

535
00:37:46.051 --> 00:37:48.840
before they know it,
they're just kind of lost.

536
00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:53.220
Uh,
but when we looked at the interviews,

537
00:37:53.221 --> 00:37:57.330
we found there are actually two very distinct groups of people,

538
00:37:57.930 --> 00:38:02.930
those who reported being high in self control of their work and those who

539
00:38:03.871 --> 00:38:05.190
reported being low.

540
00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:08.910
And indeed when we did some more analyses,

541
00:38:08.911 --> 00:38:11.700
we found people who had high self control.

542
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:15.000
We're significantly more conscientious.

543
00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:20.240
It's a personality trait and they were significantly less impulsive.

544
00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:23.153
Okay.

545
00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:28.700
Now we went back and we looked at the data again in terms of these two different

546
00:38:28.981 --> 00:38:33.981
groups and we found something really interesting that the low self control

547
00:38:34.531 --> 00:38:36.640
group,
they're distractions were blocked.

548
00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:41.760
There really was no difference in their workload.
The amount of um,

549
00:38:41.890 --> 00:38:46.420
mental expenditure that they,
um,
that they had.

550
00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:51.460
Yes.
Glx is the NASA TLX scale.
It's measure of workload.

551
00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:55.470
So it's a very common,
very well validated,
uh,

552
00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:59.410
scale that's used for workload.
However,

553
00:38:59.411 --> 00:39:02.890
we found something interesting with the high self control group,

554
00:39:02.891 --> 00:39:06.820
people who are very conscientious people,

555
00:39:06.821 --> 00:39:10.060
that means they're very diligent in their work.
Uh,

556
00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:13.030
people who feel that they're in control of their work.

557
00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:16.090
When distractions were cut off,
guess what?

558
00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:21.190
Their workload increased significantly.
So we found this,

559
00:39:21.370 --> 00:39:26.050
this interesting interaction.
Why is that the case?

560
00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:30.850
Um,
well the reason is because people,

561
00:39:30.851 --> 00:39:35.500
these are diligent people work hard and they did not take breaks.

562
00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:39.580
Whereas the people who had low self control,

563
00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:44.440
they wa,
you know,
they took physical breaks,
they went to the Coffee Room Wart,

564
00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:49.630
they interacted with people more.
Um,
but people who were very,
uh,

565
00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:53.920
you know,
high in self control continued to work straight through without breaks.

566
00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:59.110
So of course their workload increased and their stress increased significantly.

567
00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:03.040
One person missed her shuttle at the end of the day,

568
00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:07.410
never happened before it because she was so immersed in work and,

569
00:40:07.411 --> 00:40:09.250
and didn't even take any breaks.

570
00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:14.660
So we see there's individual differences in,

571
00:40:14.661 --> 00:40:18.320
in the use of this kind of software to block distractions.

572
00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:21.350
People with low self regulation,
right?

573
00:40:21.351 --> 00:40:24.020
We see they're more likely to take physical breaks.

574
00:40:24.350 --> 00:40:26.970
We see less cognitive switching.
So we,

575
00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:29.540
they did focus significantly longer.

576
00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:35.090
And so we hypothesized that the purpose of this kind of software,

577
00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:40.360
it's to offload this regulation ability to the software.

578
00:40:40.791 --> 00:40:45.320
People don't have that ability.
It's not,
you know,
innate for them.

579
00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:50.530
So they offloaded onto the software people who already have high self

580
00:40:51.711 --> 00:40:53.630
regulation,
well,

581
00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:58.400
when they use those kind of software to block distractions,
they work longer,

582
00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:02.300
fewer physical breaks,
and as a result,
higher workload.

583
00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:07.660
And so our hypotheses is that using this kind of software actually interferes

584
00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:14.120
with people's ability to self regulate,
right?
They do pretty well on their own.

585
00:41:14.570 --> 00:41:17.900
And so this whole idea of these,
you know,
this,

586
00:41:17.901 --> 00:41:22.901
this huge business in a distraction blocking software that one size fits all,

587
00:41:24.591 --> 00:41:25.424
it's not true.

588
00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:33.210
So there's a lot of opportunities to improve work experience based on this work.

589
00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:36.190
For example,
we can,
um,

590
00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:40.850
think about balancing wrote and focused work throughout the day,
right?

591
00:41:40.851 --> 00:41:42.590
We don't want to overload people.

592
00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:46.700
We want to think about balancing people's moods.
Uh,

593
00:41:46.701 --> 00:41:51.020
we can think about scheduling work based on attention patterns.

594
00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:56.380
And we can also think it's an opportunity for interventions that can nudge

595
00:41:56.541 --> 00:41:59.420
people to increase focus,
uh,

596
00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:01.760
reduce stress and improve their mood.

597
00:42:01.761 --> 00:42:06.650
And deciding of nudging is something I've been thinking about quite a bit and

598
00:42:06.651 --> 00:42:08.570
thinking about blocking distractions,

599
00:42:08.571 --> 00:42:13.220
but only for those with low control.
Um,

600
00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:13.880
okay.

601
00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:18.530
Now I'm going to put on my psychologist hat to close here.

602
00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:21.980
Okay.
So,
so bear with me.
Um,

603
00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:24.920
throughout the history of psychology,

604
00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:30.490
there has always been this idea that people take actions in order to achieve a

605
00:42:34.341 --> 00:42:39.120
kind of balanced,
emotional and psychological state.
It's,

606
00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:43.340
it's this common thread through eons of research.

607
00:42:43.341 --> 00:42:46.610
Hippocrates talked about this idea of harmonious,

608
00:42:46.611 --> 00:42:51.260
balanced with health and gestalt theorists,
if you're familiar with them,

609
00:42:51.261 --> 00:42:54.260
talked about this,
the law of pragmatics,

610
00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:58.370
a Canon talked about homeostasis.

611
00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:01.130
My favorite psychologists of all is Kurt Lewin,

612
00:43:01.131 --> 00:43:03.230
who talked about this idea of field theory,

613
00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:05.750
who said that everything we do in life,

614
00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:10.730
every action we take is designed to reduce tension because tension is

615
00:43:10.731 --> 00:43:12.920
uncomfortable.
And,
uh,

616
00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:15.830
you're probably familiar with cognitive dissonance theory,

617
00:43:15.831 --> 00:43:19.580
which also is this idea of how people can restore,

618
00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:24.610
reduce this kind of imbalance between their attitudes and their behaviors.

619
00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:27.710
And so,
uh,

620
00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:32.510
I would like to leave you with this idea that maybe people adjust their use of

621
00:43:32.511 --> 00:43:37.250
digital media in order to try to achieve an internal balance.

622
00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:42.460
So because information workers spend a good part most of their day working with

623
00:43:43.731 --> 00:43:44.630
digital media,

624
00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:49.760
maybe people use it in such a way that they're,

625
00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:53.000
they're trying to create this internal balance.

626
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.290
So the way they take breaks or don't take breaks or the kinds of,

627
00:43:57.710 --> 00:44:00.680
uh,
applications they choose to work on.

628
00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:05.340
Want to quickly talk about,
uh,

629
00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:09.320
another project that I've just been starting working on.

630
00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:14.560
This is the largest sensing project yet that we have ever done and to my

631
00:44:15.021 --> 00:44:17.420
knowledge that anyone has ever done in the workplace.

632
00:44:17.810 --> 00:44:21.560
And the idea here is to predict,
uh,

633
00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:23.360
the workplace experience.

634
00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:28.280
So people's health and wellbeing using unobtrusive sensors,

635
00:44:28.281 --> 00:44:29.300
that's really key.

636
00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:33.980
We can't introduce any of sensors that would disrupt people's,
uh,

637
00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:36.870
work experience.
Uh,

638
00:44:37.410 --> 00:44:42.120
our goal is to track 750 workers over one year.

639
00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:42.901
Uh,

640
00:44:42.901 --> 00:44:47.901
we have to date about 708 in the study and we wanted to be for a whole year

641
00:44:50.581 --> 00:44:52.680
because then we can track life events.

642
00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:58.040
We can look at what is the effect of a significant life events like births and

643
00:44:58.651 --> 00:45:03.651
deaths and job changes and marriages and divorces.

644
00:45:04.050 --> 00:45:04.740
And uh,

645
00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:09.740
we can look at seasons and how that affects and how all of this can be fed into

646
00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:15.120
the sensor data to help understand how it affects people's work.

647
00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:20.010
Lots.
And we will use a robust sensing system,

648
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:24.300
uh,
comprised of wearable devices,
beacons,
phone agent,

649
00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:28.620
and we will use social media but not look at content.

650
00:45:29.070 --> 00:45:33.330
We will just look at metadata and you can learn more here.

651
00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:38.190
Uh,
this work could not have been done without the collaboration of a number of

652
00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:42.330
really great colleagues who are listed here.

653
00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:44.880
And I'd like to thank,
uh,

654
00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:48.360
funders and our participants.
Thank you.

655
00:45:52.930 --> 00:45:56.020
So if anyone has any questions,

656
00:45:56.970 --> 00:45:58.180
we had the question box

657
00:45:59.370 --> 00:46:00.203
<v 4>restrooms.</v>

658
00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:08.250
<v 5>What's the difference between like being bored and stress between what?</v>

659
00:46:08.251 --> 00:46:12.420
Boredom and stress,
low stress.
How do you distinguish low stress from boredom?

660
00:46:12.421 --> 00:46:12.860
Yeah.

661
00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:17.400
<v 2>Oh boy.
Okay.
So,
um,
there is actually,</v>

662
00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:22.750
they are actually related but you can have low stress and be happy.

663
00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:28.370
So there is the circumplex model of nude where,
um,

664
00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:29.540
if you have,

665
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:34.750
you can have low energy and negative aspect and that's different from having

666
00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:42.230
negative effect and,
and um,
high energy,

667
00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:45.160
that quadrant negative aspect,

668
00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:50.200
high energy would be defined as stress and the quadrant of negative affect and

669
00:46:50.361 --> 00:46:53.570
low energy would be,
uh,
related to boredom.

670
00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:57.600
<v 4>Thanks.
Yeah.</v>

671
00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:05.800
<v 5>So most of your explanations are in terms of mood being effected by what work</v>

672
00:47:06.111 --> 00:47:10.770
you do,
to what extent you think your data might be,
uh,

673
00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:14.360
a case of what work you choose to do depending on your mood.

674
00:47:15.310 --> 00:47:18.640
<v 2>Oh,
fascinating.
Um,
we cannot,</v>

675
00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:22.810
we actually can't assign clause alad.
Right.

676
00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:27.000
And I did not mean to imply causality here is,

677
00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:31.540
it's all correlation.
Just like with these huge medical studies,
you know,

678
00:47:31.541 --> 00:47:36.430
like smoking and lung cancer,
we can imply causality.
Um,

679
00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:41.230
so we can't disentangle that.
Right.
And,
um,

680
00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:44.800
and it wouldn't be,
it would be an interesting study,

681
00:47:44.801 --> 00:47:49.801
but that would have to be more of an experimental nature to be able to induce

682
00:47:50.051 --> 00:47:54.430
different kinds of moods and then to see what kind of work people choose.

683
00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:55.211
But it's,

684
00:47:55.211 --> 00:47:59.350
it's hard when you're just tracking people in these kinds of observational

685
00:47:59.351 --> 00:48:03.710
studies to try to infer causality.
But it's a,

686
00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:04.740
it's a good question.

687
00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:15.170
<v 6>Stick work.
So,
um,
I print this is information workers,</v>

688
00:48:15.171 --> 00:48:19.840
so it's presumably an open office,
sort of a set up,
a mixed,

689
00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:25.120
<v 2>it's mixed.
Yeah.
Actually most of them were not in open office settings.
Okay.</v>

690
00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:30.110
<v 6>Do you think that has any bearing on like um,</v>

691
00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:31.560
attention and things like that?

692
00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:36.210
<v 2>Yes.
Uh,
so it certainly has a bearing on interruptions.</v>

693
00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:40.710
And so in other work we found that in an open office setting,

694
00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:46.100
people were more likely to be interrupted for work that was peripheral to what

695
00:48:47.131 --> 00:48:48.690
they were doing.
Right.

696
00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:52.860
So your colleagues help me debug this or what's your opinion on this?

697
00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:55.650
And it's not worked for which they are accountable.

698
00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:58.440
It's not tasks that they're assigned to do.

699
00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:02.880
This happens more in open office settings.
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

700
00:49:02.881 --> 00:49:07.740
Well,
you know,
if you ask individuals,
they might say,
wow,
it's not a good thing.

701
00:49:07.890 --> 00:49:11.130
If you ask management,
they might say,
yeah,
that's a good thing.
We're,

702
00:49:11.131 --> 00:49:13.020
we're sharing expertise.

703
00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:17.140
<v 6>What about a sense of agency and like,
so like you're saying,</v>

704
00:49:17.141 --> 00:49:20.020
so it seems like it's a competition of wills,
right?

705
00:49:20.021 --> 00:49:23.950
Like who's going to win out as management gonna win?
Or do you think,

706
00:49:24.070 --> 00:49:27.860
do you think an open office deprives workers have a sense of agency and Lawrence

707
00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:30.130
in determining when there'll be distracted thinking of it?

708
00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:32.260
<v 2>Yeah,
that's,
that's really interesting.</v>

709
00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:35.900
I'm not sure I wouldn't use the word agency.
Um,

710
00:49:36.970 --> 00:49:37.840
I would,

711
00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:44.280
I would guess that people who have a strong sense of agency,

712
00:49:44.591 --> 00:49:49.450
high self regulation should be able to somehow create barriers.

713
00:49:49.451 --> 00:49:54.451
But this would be at a cost of perhaps being a solo shop and not being good

714
00:49:55.001 --> 00:49:59.860
colleagues.
So there was,
there was this social trade off as well,

715
00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:03.580
right?
That it's not just agency,
it's the idea.

716
00:50:03.581 --> 00:50:08.200
You want to be a good organizational citizen,
right.
You and you want to,

717
00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:09.453
um,

718
00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:14.700
expense social capital's so that you get social benefits in return someday,

719
00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:19.390
someday when you have a problem and you want to be able to tap into someone

720
00:50:19.391 --> 00:50:23.890
else's expertise.
So I think there was a lot of interesting things at play.

721
00:50:24.310 --> 00:50:26.590
A agency is perhaps one thing,

722
00:50:26.591 --> 00:50:30.110
but there's all kinds of social dynamics as well.

723
00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:33.783
<v 4>That's a little</v>

724
00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:37.810
<v 7>sure.
Um,
so I was brought up about causation,</v>

725
00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:40.810
but with the long handle data that you're planning,

726
00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:46.030
you will know something about mood before people start work and then can you

727
00:50:46.031 --> 00:50:47.710
then look at the work they choose to do?

728
00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:50.930
<v 2>Yeah,
absolutely.
So we're with this,</v>

729
00:50:50.931 --> 00:50:54.740
we can log a time series when we have this kind of longitudinal data.

730
00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:59.930
I mean we've,
we've looked at people over weeks,
right?

731
00:50:59.931 --> 00:51:03.500
And to some extent we tend see,
uh,

732
00:51:03.530 --> 00:51:06.830
this kind of causality based on time,

733
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:11.150
but I would be a lot more confident to look at it over a much longer period of

734
00:51:11.151 --> 00:51:15.830
time.
I mean,
for example,
we know that weather affects mood,

735
00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:20.480
it's causality because it's not the other way around.
Right?
So,

736
00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:25.460
so,
um,
we,
we can look at factors like that and,
you know,

737
00:51:25.461 --> 00:51:29.180
how does the stock market or,
you know,
uh,

738
00:51:29.830 --> 00:51:34.610
the factors that are really external to the workplace and how that's affecting

739
00:51:34.611 --> 00:51:39.530
people.
And there's also this kind of cyclical behavior.
For example,

740
00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:42.230
um,
I have looked at sleep debt.

741
00:51:42.650 --> 00:51:47.600
Sleep debt is the accumulation of loss of sleep over time.
And you can,

742
00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:51.200
it's kind of a cyclical pattern because if you don't get a lot of sleep,

743
00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:55.580
we find that people spend more time on lightweight activities like social media,

744
00:51:55.581 --> 00:52:00.530
Facebook,
because it's easy,
right?
And,
and then you sleep less.

745
00:52:00.590 --> 00:52:04.640
Oh,
maybe it's because you didn't get your work done and your,
uh,
you know,

746
00:52:04.641 --> 00:52:07.070
you need to,
to work longer hours.

747
00:52:07.071 --> 00:52:10.070
So there can be these kinds of cyclical effects.

748
00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:16.620
Okay.
