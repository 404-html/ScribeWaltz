1
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.040
[inaudible].

2
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.260
<v 0>Hello.
How's it work?</v>

3
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.720
This is a cool place.
So not a bad spot.
We have our own real estate kind of.
Yeah,

4
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.850
you're the real estate guy,
let's say guide.
It's exciting to enter through.
Uh,

5
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.930
the other real estate guy.
I love doing deals with Google people.
It's great.

6
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.550
You always know they can close.
Right?
Which is really important to me.

7
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.980
Well,
it's in a big,
it's a big talent pool.
We have 10,000 Googlers in New York,

8
00:00:38.981 --> 00:00:42.500
so I know,
I don't,
I don't think you've sold to all of them yet.
No,
not yet.

9
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.870
Not yet.
Yeah.
Yet that is the goal.

10
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.730
So why don't we start in the book.
You talked about your childhood,

11
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.810
childhood growing up opposite to the guy you see on TV.

12
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.970
And I thought that'd be a great place to start.
Great.
Uh,

13
00:00:58.971 --> 00:01:00.110
yeah.
You know,

14
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.330
<v 2>a lot of people,
most people know me from million dollar listing New York,</v>

15
00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:06.720
which started in 2012.
I was cast on it in 2010.

16
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.030
How I got cast on that as a totally,
it's like book number two.
Um,
I,

17
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.430
but I wasn't,
you know,

18
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.810
I think I was kind of like the opposite person when I was a little kid.
Right.

19
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.980
Like the Anti Salesperson,
which is a big push for me to write the book.

20
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.300
Like it didn't necessarily write it for great salespeople out there who are

21
00:01:24.301 --> 00:01:27.420
crushing it and at the top of their class.
Right.
I mean,

22
00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:28.830
I think those people should also get it,

23
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.450
but I really wrote it for the people who were like me,
who were super shy,

24
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.470
introverted.
I moved eight times before I hit fourth grade.

25
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.370
Like I was really overweight.
I had really bad self confidence.

26
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.150
I just liked theater.
My parents made me play every single sport known to man,

27
00:01:45.151 --> 00:01:49.980
hoping I would get over it.
Um,
you know,
uh,
it was,
you know,

28
00:01:49.981 --> 00:01:51.630
my whole family is in finance,

29
00:01:51.631 --> 00:01:55.440
everyone's very business oriented and I just want it to do like theater and come

30
00:01:55.441 --> 00:02:00.330
to New York after college.
Uh,
which no one approved of whatsoever.
Um,

31
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.370
and then I ran out of money.
Right.
I mean,
that's like kind of classic story.

32
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.250
I moved here in 2006.
I went to Hamilton College in upstate New York.

33
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.350
I was a theater major,
also English lit because my parents made me and um,

34
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.390
and I gave myself two years on like summer savings and it lasted me two years

35
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.940
and I ran out of money and didn't know what to do.

36
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.230
And it was either go home to Colorado and painted fence for the rest of my life

37
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.950
or which was an actual summer job.
I had painting wood fence.

38
00:02:28.951 --> 00:02:32.700
There's a lot of it in Colorado.
Um,
or figure out something.

39
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.610
I had a friend of mine who was like,
listen,
don't be a waiter.

40
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.830
Don't be a bartender.
Get your real estate license markets insane.

41
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.260
This was the summer of 2008.

42
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.060
<v 0>Your timing was impeccable.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I could not tell the future.
Yeah.
Um,
and uh,</v>

43
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.040
as a real estate guy for Lehman brothers when it went under,
yeah.

44
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.880
I know what your first day of work was like.

45
00:02:50.881 --> 00:02:55.410
So you started the day Lehman collapsed.
Yeah.
September 15th.
Yeah.
Yeah.
2008.

46
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.410
It's a big,
which for a lot of people was a really awful day for me.

47
00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:00.180
It was one of those.

48
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.550
<v 2>Yeah.
Um,
and that's that,
you know,
it's tough.</v>

49
00:03:03.551 --> 00:03:07.600
I had a lot of friends who worked at Lehman.
Um,
you know,
and,
but for me,

50
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.100
I had no money.
Like I,

51
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.400
I was either a figure out this real estate thing or go home to Colorado and I

52
00:03:14.401 --> 00:03:15.790
had gotten my real estate license.

53
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.330
It didn't really all make sense to me yet what was really happening in the
world.

54
00:03:19.331 --> 00:03:21.970
Because if you're living in New York City,
trying to be an actor,

55
00:03:21.971 --> 00:03:25.840
you're not watching CNBC every day and you have no money so you don't watch the

56
00:03:25.841 --> 00:03:27.220
markets,
you don't really know.

57
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.240
And I just thought real estate was the hardest thing in the history of the
world.

58
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.690
I just figured that everyone in New York City have lost their jobs all the time.

59
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.540
You know,
those first two years,
I mean every client I would get,

60
00:03:37.541 --> 00:03:41.710
they would lose their job in 2008 and 2009 and it wouldn't be able to afford

61
00:03:41.711 --> 00:03:43.660
apartments.
So in hindsight,

62
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.050
it was the absolute best time for me to start because every broker was getting

63
00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:50.770
out of the business cause they all called the end of the world.
Um,

64
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.030
and for me I was there to kind of like pick up the pieces and just sort of

65
00:03:55.031 --> 00:03:56.860
figured out as I went.

66
00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.380
So you talk about Improv as a training ground.
Yeah.

67
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.570
So spend a minute on that.

68
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.160
Most important training I ever did to be a real estate agent was taking Improv

69
00:04:09.161 --> 00:04:10.600
classes in high school and college.

70
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.580
And I still make everyone who works for me taking prof,
um,
because it is,

71
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.840
it was important that you can do as a salesperson is learn how to listen and

72
00:04:19.841 --> 00:04:21.100
learn how to act on your feet.

73
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.920
And those are two things that a lot of people think they have,
but it is,

74
00:04:23.921 --> 00:04:25.780
it's a real muscle,
you know,

75
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.810
it to be able to think on your feet and never used the word no is a really kind

76
00:04:31.431 --> 00:04:35.830
of hard thing to do because most people will say,
um,
like right.

77
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.700
Or let me think.
That's like,
that's how we grow up.

78
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.290
But to be able to say yes and over and over and over to whatever your client is

79
00:04:44.291 --> 00:04:49.120
saying,
but was like my really,
really helped me a lot when I first started.

80
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.830
Um,
and the people have taken Improv,
you know what it is.
Okay.

81
00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.790
So we have work to do.
It's important especially because,
yeah,
exactly.
Because it,

82
00:04:57.791 --> 00:05:00.730
it really,
it's really scary,
especially as you get older.

83
00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.310
And I was just fortunate that I took it when I was younger and then thought it

84
00:05:03.311 --> 00:05:05.050
was fun.
But once you get older,

85
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.140
you're more self aware and you don't like to embarrass yourself.

86
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.470
And so that's actually when it's more fun cause it's just ridiculous to watch

87
00:05:11.471 --> 00:05:15.550
people.
Um,
and you should just go watch improv classes cause cause they're funny,

88
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.330
they have them everywhere and they're like five bucks or 10 bucks.
Um,

89
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.750
and you just create situations and in sales that's what you're doing.

90
00:05:22.751 --> 00:05:26.080
You're negotiating people's emotions and there's no script for that.

91
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.530
You're figuring it out as you go.
And that's what Improv is,

92
00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:30.940
has taught me and taught the team.

93
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.240
I think the other big observation you have is that,
uh,

94
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.310
in real estate sales and TV,
the first impressions are literally everything.

95
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.320
Yeah.
And if you're not careful,
they're also your last impression.
Right.

96
00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.640
So give an example of where that,
that moment occurred,

97
00:05:48.641 --> 00:05:53.020
where you were at risk of the last impression.

98
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.740
Um,
probably when I met you and I didn't look up from my phone,
so I,

99
00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.790
uh,

100
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.480
it was just in the middle of something while he was eating raisin brand as well,

101
00:06:01.481 --> 00:06:04.880
so that you guys have food here,
which is great.
I'm a real estate broker.

102
00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:07.400
Every time I see food and like cool cause it's got to,
got to survive,

103
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.570
you know,
like just take it really simply.
Right.

104
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.160
I didn't write the book for real estate agents.

105
00:06:13.161 --> 00:06:14.840
I mean my life is as a real estate agent,

106
00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:19.580
but it really wrote it for like anyone who just wants to do better and do more.

107
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.160
Whether they're selling,
you know,

108
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.670
digital advertising or they're selling themselves to their boss to get a bigger

109
00:06:25.671 --> 00:06:28.700
promotion,
or they're trying to convince their kids to go to bed on time,

110
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.000
you know,
or they're trying to pay down student debt.
Like I wrote it for,

111
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.080
for everybody.
But put yourself in the shoes,

112
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.910
like you're walking into a store and someone comes up to you and they say,

113
00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.060
or what do people typically say?
Like,
Hey,
can I help you with anything?

114
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.170
And what do you say?
No thanks.
Right?

115
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:47.060
For the most part you say,

116
00:06:47.061 --> 00:06:48.800
no thanks because you don't really want to be bothered.

117
00:06:48.801 --> 00:06:52.040
And it's a salesperson and it's like gross,
like,
no,
no,
no,
it's fine.
I got it.

118
00:06:52.041 --> 00:06:55.820
I'm looking at shoes over here,
right?
And then they'll say like,
Hey,
okay,

119
00:06:55.821 --> 00:06:57.770
let me know if you need anything.
And then they walk away.

120
00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:02.210
That is every sales person in every store in the entire world.

121
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:07.570
So you have to remember that every client interaction you have is just like

122
00:07:07.881 --> 00:07:11.960
you'd be making a friend or meeting like a future boyfriend or girlfriend.

123
00:07:11.961 --> 00:07:15.380
I mean,
could you imagine going into a bar and like tapping on someone's shoulder

124
00:07:15.381 --> 00:07:18.020
randomly and saying,
hey,
let me know if you need anything.

125
00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.050
Like how do you think that would go?

126
00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:24.170
You could get super lucky and they could say,

127
00:07:24.171 --> 00:07:27.290
actually I do need something and then that's a one off deal,

128
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:32.300
but for the most part everyone's going to say,
you were with me.
Okay,

129
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:35.630
so for the most part people are going to say,
no,
no,
I'm okay.
Or that's weird.

130
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:37.460
Right?
So that's a bad first impression,

131
00:07:37.461 --> 00:07:40.580
which is now the last impression you're going to have that salesperson,
right?

132
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.370
A different way is to introduce yourself.
Okay.

133
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.580
Introduce yourself and start with something super simple,
like a compliment.

134
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:47.450
Right?

135
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:51.400
Most people think about the clothes they're putting on or think about their

136
00:07:51.401 --> 00:07:56.401
ridiculous mustache that they grew out to try to sell books or your story or you

137
00:07:58.181 --> 00:08:01.460
know something,
right?
Or if they have a kid with them,
you compliment the kids.

138
00:08:01.461 --> 00:08:05.300
Something small just to get them to smile and to start a positive interaction.

139
00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:06.470
Swear to you.

140
00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:11.090
It works every time I've gone into stores like to buy a pair of socks,

141
00:08:11.091 --> 00:08:11.841
someone has come up to me,

142
00:08:11.841 --> 00:08:15.080
introduced themselves and complimented me on something and I've left with like a

143
00:08:15.081 --> 00:08:19.340
canoe.
And maybe that's just cause I'm gullible,

144
00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:21.770
but it also,
it works,
right?
You're,

145
00:08:21.771 --> 00:08:25.370
you're building that trust in that first impression and you have less than 20

146
00:08:25.371 --> 00:08:28.520
seconds to do it.
Oftentimes you have less than 10 seconds,
right?

147
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:29.330
Every relationship,

148
00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:33.110
even with your best friend or your partner started with like a ten second

149
00:08:33.111 --> 00:08:37.220
introduction.
And with the people you know that you're friendly with,
it works.

150
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:40.970
Other people that didn't work.
So I talk a lot about how to make it work more.

151
00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:45.450
<v 0>And then how about at the other end of the spectrum,
the indecisive client,</v>

152
00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.900
because we all have indecisive bosses and associates.

153
00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:52.380
How do you manage the indecisive client?
Okay,

154
00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:57.660
<v 2>good question.
Um,
there's,
I broke down as much as I could.</v>

155
00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:01.830
You know how there's like the six stages of grief and then like the types of

156
00:09:01.831 --> 00:09:03.810
tornadoes.
Like I always,

157
00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:08.370
when I got into the business really kind of thought of sales like the six stages

158
00:09:08.371 --> 00:09:09.180
of selling,

159
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:12.300
like what emotional clients go through because they go through their grieving

160
00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:15.630
period,
like their denial period.
They're excited,
period.

161
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:17.490
And you have to walk them through all those steps.

162
00:09:17.491 --> 00:09:21.300
And the best salespeople are the ones who can anticipate it like an er doctor,

163
00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:25.830
like they know like when this next emotional phase is going to hit so you can

164
00:09:25.831 --> 00:09:29.880
prepare how your conversation is going to lead into that moment.

165
00:09:29.881 --> 00:09:31.680
Kind of like a psychologist,
right?

166
00:09:31.681 --> 00:09:36.360
But people who are indecisive or people who are insecure about the decision that

167
00:09:36.361 --> 00:09:39.450
they're going to make any way.
Like at the end of the day,

168
00:09:39.451 --> 00:09:43.470
a lot of indecisive people we know they end up making a decision.

169
00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:48.330
They're just really self conscious or insecure about their intelligence or

170
00:09:48.331 --> 00:09:49.164
something.

171
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:52.440
And you have to help them get comfortable and figure out how to get there.

172
00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:55.290
And a lot of it is just laying out options.

173
00:09:55.590 --> 00:10:00.020
So kind of the way I just talked to you about first impressions and it could

174
00:10:00.021 --> 00:10:03.720
have been super boring,
but I made it relative by talking about dating and a bar.

175
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.050
And then people laugh and they're like,
oh,
that is kind of the same way.
Oh,

176
00:10:07.051 --> 00:10:10.710
interesting.
Same thing with people who are indecisive,
you know,

177
00:10:10.711 --> 00:10:13.500
it's figuring out a way to make it relatable to them.

178
00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:17.460
And like if you have a client or a boss or somebody,

179
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.650
you figured out what they like to do personally.

180
00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:22.020
So you track them on social media,
let's say.

181
00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:24.600
And you figure out that they really liked cats.
Okay.

182
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:28.080
Or they really like golf or they're really into the jets.
I don't know.

183
00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:30.630
Something like that.
You try to,

184
00:10:30.631 --> 00:10:32.760
without telling them that you internet stock them,

185
00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:36.150
you figure out in your conversation with them how to make whatever the situation

186
00:10:36.151 --> 00:10:39.720
is you're talking about it relatable to something they really like.
Like,

187
00:10:39.721 --> 00:10:43.530
you know,
this is,
you know,
I understand you want to take your time,

188
00:10:43.531 --> 00:10:46.830
but if Sam Darnold had taken his time,
you know,
in his first game out,

189
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:50.040
might not have won that first game.
Huh.
And then that guy is going to be like,

190
00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:54.990
dude,
you're a jets fan.
Like I mean,
sure,
yeah,
no,
I am.
Oh,
crazy.

191
00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.870
Yeah.
Anyway,
the real reason I don't want to do this is because of x,
y,

192
00:10:57.871 --> 00:11:00.930
and z because now it's on a personal level now that they about something that

193
00:11:00.931 --> 00:11:01.591
really like,

194
00:11:01.591 --> 00:11:05.280
plus you made it relatable and it's just how you present that information versus

195
00:11:05.281 --> 00:11:09.330
that salesperson who just says,
can I help you with anything?
No.
Okay.

196
00:11:09.331 --> 00:11:14.120
Let me know if you need anything.
Great.
That's most people.
And so you,

197
00:11:14.121 --> 00:11:18.210
you talk about the four tenants of work,
the four ws.
Yeah.

198
00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:21.600
So it's the why the work you're wall and the win.
Yeah.

199
00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:25.680
Spend a little time on the wall.
Um,

200
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:31.200
so when I first got into the business,
I had no boss.

201
00:11:31.201 --> 00:11:33.630
I had no mentor.
I went to a brokerage called nest seekers,

202
00:11:33.631 --> 00:11:36.720
which is still there and there's like 800 agents there now.
When I was there,

203
00:11:36.721 --> 00:11:41.721
it was like 20 above Burger Heaven on 49th and Madison and didn't really have a

204
00:11:42.631 --> 00:11:45.240
mentor.
No one told me what to do all the direction.

205
00:11:45.241 --> 00:11:49.470
I was given was find apartments that are in other cities that look cool,

206
00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:53.950
post them on craigslist,
use really good pricing,
meet people at Starbucks,

207
00:11:53.951 --> 00:11:56.820
take them to other apartments.
Okay.

208
00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:02.140
That was the New York City rental broker way of life up until like 2009.

209
00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:07.360
Um,
and so I didn't want to do that.
That seems super weird to me.

210
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.570
And I wanted to figure out how I was going to actually build a sales business

211
00:12:10.571 --> 00:12:13.960
and how I was going to build like a sales career and not just be someone who

212
00:12:13.961 --> 00:12:18.760
lived deal by deal by deal or somebody who woke up a year from now and said,
wow,

213
00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:19.810
last year was great,

214
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:23.980
but it was also the same exact kind of year that I had the year before and the

215
00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:24.440
year before and the year before.

216
00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:29.230
And I looked at all the top performers in the business and all the top
companies,

217
00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:33.670
right?
Like all the fortune 500 companies.
And you know,

218
00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:35.290
they all had really,

219
00:12:35.291 --> 00:12:39.910
really strong through lines to how they figured out like what they were working

220
00:12:39.911 --> 00:12:44.410
against.
Like what?
Like what's Google's kind of through line,
right?

221
00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:47.830
They're trying to make the Internet a better place,
more searchable,

222
00:12:47.831 --> 00:12:50.890
all that stuff.
Something like that.
Right?
You guys would know better than me.

223
00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:56.140
Anybody want to cover the mission?
Yeah,
I'm sure it's out there.
Um,
and so for me,

224
00:12:56.141 --> 00:12:58.150
I wanted to figure out what,

225
00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:01.240
like what's that thing that I'm running against as much as possible.

226
00:13:01.241 --> 00:13:04.720
And as an individual salesperson,
it has to be something personal.
So for me,

227
00:13:04.721 --> 00:13:06.060
the wall,
um,

228
00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:11.610
is that moment in the summer of 2008 when my debit card was declined at food

229
00:13:12.041 --> 00:13:15.700
emporium on 59th street,
buying Tofu of all things,
uh,

230
00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:18.580
and I didn't know what to do and I really freaked out and I just took my card

231
00:13:18.581 --> 00:13:23.020
and ran out and jumped on the subway and sat next to some random person and just

232
00:13:23.021 --> 00:13:26.650
tried to hold back tears because that was the moment I was like,

233
00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:30.910
this New York thing sucks.
I hate it.
I don't like it.
I don't want to be here.

234
00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:32.740
I just want to go home.
Um,

235
00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:37.390
and then I decided to get into real estate and that's the moment I run from

236
00:13:37.391 --> 00:13:40.390
every single day.
And it sounds kind of crazy,

237
00:13:40.391 --> 00:13:43.360
but everyone needs to have that wall,
right?
Maybe you work at Google,

238
00:13:43.361 --> 00:13:46.930
but before this you did another job that you really didn't like and you don't

239
00:13:46.931 --> 00:13:49.090
want to go back to that job because this is now super awesome.

240
00:13:49.091 --> 00:13:49.990
Do you have free cereal?

241
00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:55.260
Like that other job is your wall or maybe you just love New York so much and you

242
00:13:56.141 --> 00:13:59.830
don't want to move home to Colorado to paint fence or whatever your story is

243
00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:01.540
like that then is your wall.

244
00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:05.230
Or maybe you were bullied in high school like I was and you want to show those

245
00:14:05.231 --> 00:14:08.530
people who the boss,
that's your wall.

246
00:14:08.531 --> 00:14:12.910
So for me it was figuring out that moment on that subway and I'll run as far

247
00:14:12.911 --> 00:14:15.700
away from that moment for the rest of my life as possible.

248
00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:18.760
And the others are really just trying to get clear with your goals.

249
00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:21.880
Like companies have goals,
companies have mission statements,

250
00:14:21.881 --> 00:14:24.160
why shouldn't individual people have the same thing?

251
00:14:24.161 --> 00:14:27.190
Why should an individual salespeople have the same thing?

252
00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.220
You should also have what your,
your when is right.

253
00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:33.160
That's kind of the mission statement.
So for me,
my wind,

254
00:14:33.161 --> 00:14:36.010
but doing so likes her hand for Bravo and then writing this book.

255
00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:38.410
I think that I'll always do real estate,

256
00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:43.680
but I really have found that my passion is helping other people increased the

257
00:14:43.781 --> 00:14:46.570
quality of their lives through selling.

258
00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:51.740
Because selling is like the greatest career you could have because one will ever

259
00:14:51.741 --> 00:14:54.260
take it away from you and you will never be unemployed,

260
00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:57.830
especially in a volatile work market the way we have it now.

261
00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.080
Like I right now am unemployed.

262
00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:04.130
I don't get a w two I get a 10 99 I eat what I kill every single day.

263
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:09.170
I'm a very successful unemployed,
employed person and I,

264
00:15:09.171 --> 00:15:11.660
that's the greatest thing because I get,
I get fired every week.

265
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:15.530
Clients fire me all the time just because that's what happens in this business.

266
00:15:15.531 --> 00:15:18.560
But it's okay because I have other clients and they make up for it.

267
00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:23.300
I don't ever want to put myself in a position where everything in my life could

268
00:15:23.301 --> 00:15:25.570
be held by one place.
And as a salesperson,

269
00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:27.710
you have that amazing talent to take that anywhere,

270
00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:28.820
whether it's here or somewhere else.

271
00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:34.520
<v 0>So in the show you parlay your real estate sales into supporting and helping</v>

272
00:15:37.021 --> 00:15:41.970
people who are in different stages of their life and their state of kind of,

273
00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:42.990
yeah.
Where,

274
00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:47.580
how do you pick those candidates and what's your greatest success in terms of

275
00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:49.493
individuals?

276
00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:53.830
<v 2>They,
uh,
there was a casting process that Bravo did this end up casting notices</v>

277
00:15:53.831 --> 00:15:57.820
everywhere.
Um,
and then just got lots of submissions from people.

278
00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:00.610
It was hard to cast because a lot of people,

279
00:16:00.611 --> 00:16:04.900
cause they'll show only made sense if I was working with really bad salespeople

280
00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:08.890
who are literally about to lose their jobs and then the business had to agree to

281
00:16:08.891 --> 00:16:12.340
go on camera.
Like their families had to agree to go on camera.

282
00:16:12.341 --> 00:16:15.550
The bosses had to agree to go on camera.
So there's like a whole process to it.

283
00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.870
So it was hard to find people that wanted to put themselves out there like that.

284
00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:24.220
Um,
but I think the most successful person,

285
00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:27.340
I don't know if you've watched the show,
but there is kind of too,

286
00:16:27.341 --> 00:16:29.590
there was one guy who sold wine.
Um,

287
00:16:29.591 --> 00:16:34.480
his name was Tim in Millbrook and he let me know that he was a recovering
addict.

288
00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:38.440
Like when I first met him,
which was really tough cause he sold wine.

289
00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:41.620
But that was all he knew how to do.
Like he,

290
00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:46.120
he got addicted to heroin outside Phoenix when he was 13 math when he was 14,

291
00:16:46.121 --> 00:16:47.730
tried to kill himself when he was 15,

292
00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:52.690
cleaned himself up and sent himself into the army when he,
I guess was 17,

293
00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:57.100
did two tours to Afghanistan and then came back clean,
ready to go.

294
00:16:57.101 --> 00:16:59.830
Wouldn't go back home to Phoenix because that's where all those triggers were.

295
00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.150
Tried to get a job in New York,
couldn't get one.
Um,

296
00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:05.260
put himself through the New York Culinary Institute,

297
00:17:05.261 --> 00:17:07.870
but then couldn't get a job as a chef.
And then a friend said,
listen,

298
00:17:07.871 --> 00:17:10.450
I've got this winery in Millbrook.
Come work with me.
Sell wine.

299
00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.360
Had no idea what selling was.
Thoughts.

300
00:17:12.361 --> 00:17:16.450
Salespeople were the worst people in the world,
uh,
like legitimately.

301
00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:21.730
And,
um,
and I helped him understand that selling isn't taking,

302
00:17:21.731 --> 00:17:24.910
selling isn't being greedy.
Selling isn't like,
come on,
come on,
come on.

303
00:17:24.911 --> 00:17:29.230
Just do this,
do this,
like selling is assuring.
It's not convincing.

304
00:17:29.231 --> 00:17:33.580
Selling is walking people through options so that they picked the best one for

305
00:17:33.581 --> 00:17:36.520
them and an option that they otherwise would have picked anyway.

306
00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:38.680
But they're just going to do it with you and not do it online.

307
00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:43.420
Are they going to do it with you now and not do it later.
Right.
Um,

308
00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.660
and so that was a good one for me working with him because he had a,

309
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:51.420
like we secretly flew his parents in from and he hadn't seen them since he got

310
00:17:51.421 --> 00:17:55.200
back from Afghanistan.
Like the whole thing was crazy million dollar listing.

311
00:17:55.201 --> 00:17:59.100
Very different show.
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah.

312
00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:03.570
<v 0>So in,
in a recent interview you said that one of your core principles is for</v>

313
00:18:03.571 --> 00:18:07.170
sustaining key relationships is actually knowing how to give before you take

314
00:18:07.171 --> 00:18:12.090
anything.
Yeah.
And I think you've kind of spoke to that a minute ago,
but if you,

315
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:15.560
not that we're off camera,
but if you were speaking off camera,
um,

316
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:16.710
versus on camera,

317
00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:20.580
what would you like people to know about the reality reality TV that they may

318
00:18:20.581 --> 00:18:21.414
not know?

319
00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:27.580
<v 2>Million or listening takes us nine months to film an entire season.
Um,</v>

320
00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.250
and an air is really,
really quickly.

321
00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:33.540
So there's a lot of stuff behind the scenes that you don't see just because it's

322
00:18:33.541 --> 00:18:38.070
boring TV.
Unfortunately.
Like I always want to show like the deal stuff,

323
00:18:38.071 --> 00:18:41.150
the closing costs,
the taxes,
you know,
all like the,

324
00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:43.950
like the crazy stuff that really drives us crazy.

325
00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:48.720
It's hard TV to show and there's three of us on the show.
It's an hour show,

326
00:18:48.721 --> 00:18:51.420
which means there's 44 minutes or 16 minutes of commercials,

327
00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:56.600
which means each of us get like 11 to 12 minutes of airtime and it has to be cut

328
00:18:56.821 --> 00:19:01.080
down into just those big moments,
get listing,
figure out how to sell it,

329
00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:04.740
don't sell it,
maybe sell it a little personal item done.

330
00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:10.260
Um,
but there's so much more that goes into it,
right?
Like I start my day very,

331
00:19:10.261 --> 00:19:13.890
very early and I tried to start in the office to prep for the day ahead and then

332
00:19:13.891 --> 00:19:18.630
I end incredibly late to clean up the previous day and then prep for my day

333
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:21.030
ahead.
Like my day starts the night before.

334
00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:24.180
And that was an important thing that I figured out when I first got into the

335
00:19:24.181 --> 00:19:25.170
business.
Otherwise,

336
00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:27.990
like you wake up and you're scattered and you look at your calendar and like,

337
00:19:27.991 --> 00:19:29.010
all right,
what do I have to do today?

338
00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:33.420
But by then like your day is already be gone and it's like you're late to the

339
00:19:33.421 --> 00:19:38.340
race.
Um,
but yeah,
reality TV is fun.
You know,

340
00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.270
it's been good for me.

341
00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:44.760
I mean I got onto that show by just like convincing them I was the greatest real

342
00:19:45.391 --> 00:19:48.750
estate broker in the history of the world and I knew that they were from La and

343
00:19:48.751 --> 00:19:52.770
they didn't know anything and they were like,
are you sure?
And I was like,
yes,

344
00:19:52.771 --> 00:19:56.220
I am sure.
Like really?
Cause then all these other brokers that were interviewing,

345
00:19:56.221 --> 00:19:58.920
they don't know who you are.
And I'm like,
really?
It's just cause they're jelly.

346
00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:03.390
Right.
And they slowly whittled it down and whittled it down.

347
00:20:03.391 --> 00:20:05.670
And I got to the point where I was like,

348
00:20:05.671 --> 00:20:09.210
just getting friends to help me with things and like trying to like,

349
00:20:09.211 --> 00:20:11.640
it was like call,
call me 50 times a day,
call me,
call me.

350
00:20:11.641 --> 00:20:14.280
Cause I'm with the cameras right now and they're still interviewing like 15

351
00:20:14.281 --> 00:20:17.250
other people and like,
what am I calling you for?
So they call me,
they'll be like,

352
00:20:17.251 --> 00:20:19.620
Hey Ryan,
you told me that I'd be like,
yeah,
no deals closing,

353
00:20:19.621 --> 00:20:21.660
I'll call you right back.
Boom.
And the producers were like,

354
00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:25.310
this is the greatest real estate broker we've ever seen.
Um,

355
00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:26.970
I've been doing it now for eight years,

356
00:20:26.971 --> 00:20:30.780
so I'm comfortable putting that out there,
but,
and then got cast on it.

357
00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:35.100
And then that was like,
uh,
oh,
all right.
Now I got to figure this out.

358
00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:39.360
My whole life has been just saying yes to everything and then having to just

359
00:20:39.361 --> 00:20:40.380
figure it out.

360
00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.140
<v 0>So,
which is a great lead into,</v>

361
00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:46.740
you talked about when it's time to let the deal go and how to feel.

362
00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:50.860
<v 2>Yeah,
I think that,
uh,</v>

363
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:53.020
I mean when I first started as a salesperson,

364
00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:56.890
I didn't let any deal go right because I didn't really have a whole lot of

365
00:20:56.891 --> 00:20:57.550
choice.

366
00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:01.090
And some of my first clients were people like definitely should have let go.

367
00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:04.510
But it's,
it's a time benefit analysis,
right?

368
00:21:04.511 --> 00:21:09.100
You're never going to close somebody who has a great personal relationship with

369
00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:10.480
someone else who does what you do.

370
00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:14.020
Like I as many apartments as that would love to sell.

371
00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:18.730
There are always going to be sellers who grew up with a real estate broker today

372
00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:22.150
or who are married to a real estate broker or you know,

373
00:21:22.151 --> 00:21:25.200
who have some kind of personal connection.
Those are people that I,

374
00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:30.010
I need to really look at the time that I would put into that deal and probably

375
00:21:30.011 --> 00:21:33.670
decide,
you know what,
I'm going to lead them for other people.
It's okay,
right?

376
00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.460
I'll live,
I'll go find other people.
Um,

377
00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:40.210
and then there are people too who are just completely irrational,
unreasonable.

378
00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:45.280
And you know those people you have to cut loose when they don't really move up

379
00:21:45.281 --> 00:21:49.180
that emotional kind of ladder that I talk about in the book.

380
00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:53.440
Like if they just stay on hysteric or you know,

381
00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:57.460
overemotional or if they're mean like there's a lot of people in the world who

382
00:21:57.461 --> 00:22:00.250
are really mean and are belittling,
especially in my business,

383
00:22:00.251 --> 00:22:02.050
I don't know how it is for you guys,

384
00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:06.740
but like it is really easy to be mean to a real estate agent.
Right?

385
00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.160
And it's easy to take out all your frustration on that,

386
00:22:09.161 --> 00:22:12.970
which is fine and I'm totally okay with it and I get yelled at every day.

387
00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:16.780
But if that's there,
like status quo,

388
00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:20.290
then those are people that I need to let go just to say the negative energy.

389
00:22:20.291 --> 00:22:23.800
It's going to affect me in all of my other deals and I don't want to bring that

390
00:22:23.801 --> 00:22:25.030
into the rest of my life.

391
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:28.990
<v 0>So in the book you talk about client x,</v>

392
00:22:28.991 --> 00:22:32.380
which may not have been your hardest deal you've ever closed,

393
00:22:32.381 --> 00:22:34.090
but it might be.

394
00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:37.690
So it spend a minute on that because I think it's such an amazing story.

395
00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:43.400
<v 2>Oh Man.
In the book,
I have to call them client acts for fear of my life.
Um,</v>

396
00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:47.400
and I say he's from Atlantis also for fear of my life.
Um,

397
00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:52.580
so client x was a guy who cold emailed me when I first got into the business and

398
00:22:53.641 --> 00:22:58.440
said he'd like to invest money into the New York City real estate market.

399
00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:02.600
Um,
would I be able to help him?
Um,

400
00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:07.410
he would use real cash dollars and would need bank account help.
Okay.

401
00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:10.770
Uh,
and I totally replied and I was like,
absolutely,

402
00:23:10.771 --> 00:23:14.880
I can help you with bank account help and absolutely,
we take cash,
money,

403
00:23:14.881 --> 00:23:18.180
dollars and,
uh,
how much are you looking to spend?

404
00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.820
And he was like less than 10 million.

405
00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:24.780
And I was doing like $2,000 a month convertible,

406
00:23:24.781 --> 00:23:27.090
three rentals in the West village to Jessica,

407
00:23:27.091 --> 00:23:31.650
Jessica and her friend Jessica at the time.
So like,
I,
you know,
uh,

408
00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:34.260
who were coming from Murray Hill with their guarantor father.

409
00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:39.620
And so a guy who all of a sudden just told me $10 million for over the Internet.

410
00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:43.140
I was like,
boom,
Jackpot.
This is New York City real estate.

411
00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:46.940
And I got super excited and then he wanted to talk on the phone.
So he had to,

412
00:23:46.941 --> 00:23:49.400
he was like a real person sort of a,

413
00:23:49.401 --> 00:23:51.620
and I just sent him a bunch of listings because I didn't know.

414
00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:55.370
And he picked one at 45 west 67th street,
apartment 15 ABC.

415
00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:59.900
And I remember every address and he said,
uh,

416
00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:04.640
I would like that one make offer 8 million.
And it was asking 8.5 million.

417
00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:09.350
And I was just like,
holy mother of I just $8 million offer.
This is what it is.

418
00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:13.250
This is,
I am now the greatest real estate broker in the history of the world.
Uh,

419
00:24:13.251 --> 00:24:16.710
I asked him to send me a proof of funds and he sent me a DHL.
Right?

420
00:24:16.711 --> 00:24:17.544
I remember that.

421
00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:22.640
He sent me a DHL the next day with like a photo of an accountant with a letter

422
00:24:23.541 --> 00:24:24.950
that legitimate and he said,

423
00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:28.490
Mr x does not commit to things that he does not commit to.

424
00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:33.650
That was his proof of funds.
And I was totally okay with it.
I was like,

425
00:24:33.651 --> 00:24:37.940
this looks good to me.
Cash money dollars in New York City.
Uh,

426
00:24:37.941 --> 00:24:41.600
and we negotiated this deal over the Internet for eight point $3 million.

427
00:24:41.601 --> 00:24:45.290
And I was immediately thinking about the commission in my head and thinking

428
00:24:45.291 --> 00:24:48.380
about how long I would be able to stay in my apartment with all that rent money

429
00:24:48.381 --> 00:24:52.370
and everything and craziness and taxes didn't even come into the conversation.

430
00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:53.593
Um,

431
00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:58.580
and then he disappeared off the face of the earth for like a month and he had

432
00:24:58.581 --> 00:25:00.680
had a contract and I'd introduce them to an attorney.

433
00:25:00.681 --> 00:25:03.260
He just never replied ever again.
Um,

434
00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:07.490
but I followed up like every day because this was my one big fish.

435
00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:10.790
No one else in their life had ever talked to me about spending that much money

436
00:25:10.791 --> 00:25:14.870
in an apartment.
And then he eventually writes back like a month later.

437
00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:19.520
And says,
sorry,
it's been a little busy.
I'm like,
okay,
no problem.
Uh,

438
00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:24.880
and he actually signed the contract and then he has to send a deposit and then

439
00:25:25.041 --> 00:25:28.010
the deposit never comes.
And now I've got the seller freaking out,

440
00:25:28.011 --> 00:25:31.490
other brokers going crazy and like months go by.

441
00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:35.870
So we have to sign contract and it doesn't mean anything.
And then,
uh,
uh,

442
00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:38.720
the attorney's telling me that what's basically happening is that this person

443
00:25:38.721 --> 00:25:41.660
takes a signed contract and this happens all the time in New York City and they

444
00:25:41.661 --> 00:25:44.900
shop it around the world and they say,
listen,
this is this apartment.

445
00:25:44.901 --> 00:25:47.090
It's probably worth 10 million.
I've got it for 8.3.

446
00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.700
Give me $20,000 coming in on it with me.

447
00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:52.880
And they'll sell the contract over and over and over to unsuspecting victims and

448
00:25:52.881 --> 00:25:57.110
they'll steal people's money.
So it's a scam.
Um,
and so then I was like,

449
00:25:57.111 --> 00:25:59.990
you know what?
This business sucks.
I don't want to do this anymore.

450
00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:01.310
And I'm the best broker ever.

451
00:26:01.311 --> 00:26:04.550
But now I'm the worst one because I'm involved in some money laundering scam

452
00:26:04.551 --> 00:26:06.580
between some crazy person from Atlantis.

453
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:10.670
Can't believe I responded to this guy and I think it was like two months go by

454
00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:13.580
and then the attorney calls me and says,
you're not going to believe this.

455
00:26:13.581 --> 00:26:18.581
I just got an $830,000 deposit from Bank of Atlantis and I almost had a heart

456
00:26:19.731 --> 00:26:22.790
attack.
I was like,
are we in a contract?
He's like,
yeah,
you're in contract.

457
00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:24.440
It's like holy mother of God,

458
00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:28.970
eight point $3 million for an apartment I sold over the Internet.
Um,

459
00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:31.880
and then there's this thing in New York City called a board package,
right?

460
00:26:31.881 --> 00:26:35.000
You have to do an application and then there's this thing called closing,

461
00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:39.560
which you have to do.
Uh,
and he vanished off the face of the earth,

462
00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:44.340
stopped responding to everything like six months.
Right?

463
00:26:44.341 --> 00:26:47.670
So imagine signing a contract for something and then disappearing for six
months.

464
00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:50.730
Okay.
So now you've got different attorneys looking to sue everybody,

465
00:26:50.731 --> 00:26:52.410
but who do you go after?

466
00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:55.380
Right now it's just about keeping that deposit and holding the deposit back.

467
00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:59.850
But I followed up,
it's my whole life is followup.
I wrote about in the book,

468
00:26:59.851 --> 00:27:02.400
there's a whole chapter,
it's really invigorating.
Okay.

469
00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:05.430
I will follow up with you until the day that you die.

470
00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:10.560
I followed up non stop,
just checking in,
just saying,
Hey,

471
00:27:10.561 --> 00:27:12.720
I know we're probably getting those documents together,

472
00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:14.310
still need to do this application.

473
00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:18.690
And then I had some genius idea too because I looked him up initially and I'd

474
00:27:18.691 --> 00:27:22.800
seen that like he might be attached to this house that looked expensive in
Paris.

475
00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:25.980
Okay.
Um,
and so I sent him this email that said,
hey,

476
00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:30.690
in total desperation I'll be in Paris tomorrow.
If you want to meet in person,

477
00:27:30.691 --> 00:27:31.710
we can go through the documents.

478
00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:35.970
And he wrote back in like one minute after six months of nothing and said,
sure,

479
00:27:35.971 --> 00:27:40.380
10:00 PM and gave me a location.
And now I'm like,
well shit,

480
00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:44.070
the biggest deal in my whole life that I still haven't done.

481
00:27:44.071 --> 00:27:45.630
Now we've got to figure out how to do this.

482
00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:50.190
And so I use all the money I had and uh,

483
00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:53.970
got an Aer Lingus flight through Dublin.
Uh,

484
00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:55.470
and then I think it took Ryan Air,

485
00:27:55.471 --> 00:28:00.471
which was super fitting for me to Paris to try to find this magical person.

486
00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:03.930
All the while,
like kind of telling my parents what I was up to,

487
00:28:03.931 --> 00:28:08.820
kind of not because it's a little bit sketchy and probably really dangerous.
Uh,

488
00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:11.460
and then 10:00 PM rolled by and the guy doesn't show up.

489
00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:15.180
I'm like crying and my begets,
and uh,

490
00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:17.700
I think it was like 1:00 AM cause I had nowhere to go and I didn't plan on

491
00:28:17.701 --> 00:28:20.580
getting a hotel or anything.
I just thought I'd like wing it,
you know,

492
00:28:20.581 --> 00:28:22.870
and then just go right back to the airport.
Um,

493
00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:27.030
and then what am he shows up with like a line of people.
So I know he's real.

494
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:27.930
Um,

495
00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:32.130
and all he really cared about was getting me drunk and he just wanted to watch

496
00:28:32.131 --> 00:28:33.240
me drink.
Um,

497
00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:38.190
and I was the opposite of who he was in every way,
shape and form.

498
00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:42.440
Um,
and I drank a significant amount of Tequila and he likes,

499
00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:44.010
sort of looked at the papers a little bit.

500
00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:46.650
I got them to sign two things and I would just fill out the rest.

501
00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:49.290
So I took it as a win.
Went back to New York City,

502
00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:54.720
a very sick and then he had to come close and he disappeared off the face of the

503
00:28:54.721 --> 00:28:56.910
earth again.
But at least now I knew that he was a real person.

504
00:28:57.210 --> 00:28:58.590
And then to make a long story short,

505
00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:03.360
even though as long like he randomly one day again,
months later,

506
00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:06.570
so this is like a year long process says I'm in New York City,

507
00:29:06.571 --> 00:29:10.020
I'd like to close like,
are you crazy?
It's,

508
00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:13.470
it's like 11:30 AM we will,
you can't just get a closing together right?

509
00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.750
I'll put fine,
we'll figure it out.
Because everyone was,

510
00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:18.630
they were trying to sue for deposits was crazy.
It's like,
where are you?

511
00:29:18.631 --> 00:29:22.890
Mandarin Oriental went up there to wait for him.
It doesn't come down on time.

512
00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:27.600
Finally comes down with like 15 people in this fleet of black escalates,

513
00:29:27.601 --> 00:29:31.170
pulls up outside the Mandarin Oriental completely tinted out and crazy.

514
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:33.600
The minute that happens,
I text my mom and I say goodbye.

515
00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:36.991
This is again,

516
00:29:36.991 --> 00:29:40.410
like the only deal I've ever done other than just like rental deals on

517
00:29:40.411 --> 00:29:43.210
craigslist with people that I'm like baiting and switching.
Okay.

518
00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:48.040
The New York way.
So,
uh,
we get in the car,

519
00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:51.130
he's got like an espresso assistant,
totally crazy.
And I'm like,
listen,

520
00:29:51.131 --> 00:29:53.410
Mandarin Oriental,
45 west 87th street's right there.

521
00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:54.730
Do you want to go to the walkthrough?

522
00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:57.630
I'm sure you're really excited about this apartment.
He's like,
no,
no,
no.

523
00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:59.500
We go to JFK.
Uh,

524
00:29:59.501 --> 00:30:04.340
so we went to JFK and we went to the back of JFK and we pulled up,
uh,

525
00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:05.860
and there was this big seven 47,

526
00:30:05.861 --> 00:30:08.920
and he got outside and he bought it and he got back in the car.

527
00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:12.430
And now I'm totally confused.
Now I don't really think I'm going to die now.

528
00:30:12.431 --> 00:30:15.190
I'm just like,
really?
I don't know who this person is.

529
00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:20.110
And then we go back into the city and he signs the papers and he closes a,

530
00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:24.580
and all he cares about is taking a selfie with me for his BBM profile.
Um,

531
00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:29.230
if you remember those and turns out that he prints about a billion dollars a

532
00:30:29.231 --> 00:30:30.390
month.
Um,

533
00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:35.700
and he's like wealthier than Kadafi and just wasn't concerned with this little

534
00:30:37.631 --> 00:30:41.350
apartment and the only reason that he moved forward because he thought it was

535
00:30:41.351 --> 00:30:45.760
super amusing to watch me consistently persistently follow up.

536
00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:51.760
And the fact that I actually went to Paris and he knew it was bullshit.

537
00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:55.030
Like he knew that I wasn't going to be in Paris.
Right.

538
00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:56.920
Is one of the reasons he went through it.

539
00:30:56.921 --> 00:30:59.230
And since then we've done like 300 million together.

540
00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:02.050
Just as a way to diversify and move money around.

541
00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:07.210
Every deal has been super painful.
Um,
and that's,

542
00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:09.850
that's the power of yes and right.
That's,

543
00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:14.080
and it didn't take money of mine going to Paris costs money,
but other than that,

544
00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:18.520
follow up,
following up with items of value,
like staying on top of him.

545
00:31:18.521 --> 00:31:20.500
Everything.
Every deal is a deal.

546
00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:24.490
You're just trying to see which salesperson is going to quit first.
Right.

547
00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:29.080
Just like kind of every race.
And I always equate selling to a race.

548
00:31:29.081 --> 00:31:31.060
Like you wake up every day.
That's why I say ready,
set,

549
00:31:31.061 --> 00:31:35.290
go all the time because my dad told me to say it every day before I leave when I

550
00:31:35.291 --> 00:31:37.900
was third grade.
You know,
before I step out of the house,

551
00:31:37.901 --> 00:31:40.330
before you cross over one foot ready,
set go.

552
00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:43.300
Cause it sets your mindset up for running a race.

553
00:31:43.301 --> 00:31:45.460
You just have no idea what kind of race you're going to run.

554
00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:48.400
It's gonna be a marathon today.
It might be a sprint and that it's a marathon.

555
00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:51.730
It might be hurdles and then it's like a six k you don't know.

556
00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:55.300
But as long as you are prepared in that moment,
the moment you leave your house,

557
00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:58.840
I'm going to run a race today.
I'm going to get when it in some way,

558
00:31:58.841 --> 00:31:59.674
shape or form,

559
00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:05.430
it just sets your mind to be ready to go for anything to say yes and then figure

560
00:32:05.861 --> 00:32:09.040
it out.
So that's,
uh,
so before I ask the next question,

561
00:32:09.041 --> 00:32:13.270
if anyone wants to line up to the mics and we'll open up for questions in a

562
00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:15.700
minute,
but as a great pivot to the next question,

563
00:32:15.701 --> 00:32:19.540
which is explain your get FK d um,

564
00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:23.590
theory and why it's one of your most valuable secrets.
Yeah.

565
00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:27.520
You're going through like the whole book right now,
Huh?
Yes.
It was a great book.

566
00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:31.210
You guys.
Yeah.
So Fk d um,
again,

567
00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:35.530
I was on as the world turns and got killed off.
Okay.

568
00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:38.260
That's where I made the most money before getting to real estate,

569
00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:41.330
other than hand modeling,
I hand modeled,
I held cell phones for a t.
And.

570
00:32:41.331 --> 00:32:44.870
T they were everywhere.
By the way,
if you Google my name and hand modeling,

571
00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:49.340
it's awesome.
Uh,
I held Nespresso capsules like this.

572
00:32:49.341 --> 00:32:52.820
I'd have to like move the metatarsal of like my pinkie.

573
00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:55.940
I'd have to get like hand massages and everything.
Um,

574
00:32:56.090 --> 00:33:00.050
so that's my background into business.
So then when I got into real estate,

575
00:33:00.051 --> 00:33:04.280
I didn't know.
All I knew was you post ads online,
you meet people,

576
00:33:04.281 --> 00:33:07.370
you try to convince them to sell,
to buy,
to rent.

577
00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:11.900
And I wasn't rich and I'm not from New York City and I don't go to the
synagogue.

578
00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:16.480
So like I,
I'm like shit out of luck.
Um,

579
00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:20.060
my nicest clothes wear cowboy boots and khaki pants,
right?

580
00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:22.790
And so when I made that decision of,
you know what this,

581
00:33:22.791 --> 00:33:26.120
I'm going to figure this out and I'm going to move against the grain here in New

582
00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:29.840
York City and I'm going to be the best broker ever going to figure out how I'm

583
00:33:29.841 --> 00:33:32.030
going to do it.
I didn't know how to structure my day.

584
00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:36.140
And that was the one thing that really like would get me depressed and like

585
00:33:36.141 --> 00:33:39.830
would really kind of hurt me was,
okay,
I have one appointment at 3:00 PM.

586
00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:44.210
What do I do the rest of the day?
Like,
what do I do at nine?
What do I do?

587
00:33:44.211 --> 00:33:47.540
I cold call people.
Do I ask people for help?

588
00:33:47.541 --> 00:33:51.110
Like do I post ads?
Like what,
uh,
how do I structure my day?

589
00:33:51.111 --> 00:33:54.590
And I think people are creatures of habit.
So I looked at big companies.
I said,

590
00:33:54.591 --> 00:33:58.340
okay,
every big company out there that's super successful has a CEO,
a CFO,

591
00:33:58.341 --> 00:34:00.530
and a COO.
I have no idea what they do.

592
00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:04.340
But for me I think it's important that part of my day,

593
00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:08.450
I have a CEO brain on to that for me was my finder time cause I had looked at

594
00:34:08.451 --> 00:34:11.690
CEOs and I said they find business for the company to work on.
Right.

595
00:34:11.691 --> 00:34:15.110
That's what they do.
They prospect business for the company to work on.
Yes,

596
00:34:15.111 --> 00:34:16.460
they deal with problems and all that stuff,

597
00:34:16.461 --> 00:34:21.461
but CEOs really like they are there to move the ship forward and give the

598
00:34:21.861 --> 00:34:23.780
company a lot of stuff to work on.
Okay.

599
00:34:23.781 --> 00:34:28.781
So from eight to 10:00 AM every day I'm going to put finder and those are my

600
00:34:29.151 --> 00:34:29.930
hours were everyday.

601
00:34:29.930 --> 00:34:33.200
Now I'm booked from eight to 10:00 AM I'm not waking up with nothing to do until

602
00:34:33.201 --> 00:34:38.201
3:00 PM eight to 10 it's my finder hour or two when I just focused on Ryan

603
00:34:38.301 --> 00:34:43.190
[inaudible] real estate.com like my own little personal business and how I'm

604
00:34:43.191 --> 00:34:47.510
going to sell more,
grow more and brainstorm my career.

605
00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:52.280
And it's amazing if you just spend some time every day and just think about

606
00:34:52.370 --> 00:34:54.920
yourself that way and about your business and how you're going to do better,

607
00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:58.250
you will come up with ideas that you never would have come up with just because

608
00:34:58.251 --> 00:35:02.600
your brain is capable of things that you just,
you just don't know.
Right.

609
00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:05.540
Um,
keeper was the CFO time,

610
00:35:05.541 --> 00:35:08.330
so it was like 12 to one and I would just think about all the money I didn't

611
00:35:08.331 --> 00:35:12.760
have and if I had like 10 bucks to spend that day,
you know,

612
00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:15.440
I would budget because I knew it was important to invest back in your business.

613
00:35:15.441 --> 00:35:18.950
So I would say,
okay,
$10 that gets me how many stamps?

614
00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:22.730
And I would send out letters to one building that day or it's going to get me an

615
00:35:22.731 --> 00:35:26.030
extra latte and I'm going to go to Starbucks and I'm going to try to find

616
00:35:26.031 --> 00:35:29.540
pregnant women and sell them apartments because they need more space.
Right?

617
00:35:29.541 --> 00:35:33.500
Like that's my thing today.
Um,
true story.

618
00:35:33.501 --> 00:35:36.080
So one of my first clients were pregnant and they needed more space.

619
00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:40.830
It's a real thing.
Uh,
and then my COO time was my dewar time.
So Fk d,

620
00:35:40.831 --> 00:35:41.910
that was like the rest of my day.

621
00:35:41.911 --> 00:35:44.040
That's when you put all of that stuff in the action.

622
00:35:44.041 --> 00:35:47.460
So that's when I was stamping things.
That's what I was going to Starbucks.

623
00:35:47.461 --> 00:35:51.840
That's what I was doing,
the appointments.
And I still do that to this day.
Um,

624
00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:53.160
now the times are shifted.

625
00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:56.790
Now I spend a lot more of my time in that finder time period than I do in the

626
00:35:56.791 --> 00:35:58.620
keeper and do her.
Um,

627
00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:01.680
but it's important to think about yourself as an entrepreneur and as an

628
00:36:01.681 --> 00:36:04.680
independent contractor and as a salesperson,

629
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:09.000
as somebody who runs a large company,
whether it's true or it's not,

630
00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:13.890
the only way it will be true eventually is if you think to make it so.

631
00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:19.260
Yeah.
Great.
Go to the audience.
He was here first.

632
00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:23.550
All right,
let's do,
okay.
So a million dollar listing,
you have,
uh,
you know,

633
00:36:23.551 --> 00:36:24.930
a lot of,
one on one interactions.

634
00:36:24.931 --> 00:36:27.120
Now obviously it's edited and perhaps that's not,
you know,

635
00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:30.390
how the rest of your day goes.
But,
um,
now you have a team of,
you know,

636
00:36:30.391 --> 00:36:33.570
several hundred brokers.
How do you manage them?

637
00:36:33.571 --> 00:36:35.490
Do try and spend one on one time with each of them?

638
00:36:35.491 --> 00:36:38.740
Do you have lieutenants or other people?
Like what's,
how do you structure it?
Uh,

639
00:36:38.741 --> 00:36:43.360
the team is 62,
not yet at a hundred.
Okay.
Um,
but it's,

640
00:36:43.361 --> 00:36:47.340
but thank you.
Uh,
I,

641
00:36:47.410 --> 00:36:50.170
I tried to spend as much time with them as I possibly can.
Right.

642
00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:53.460
They're all really busy and everyone's different,
right?
I,

643
00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:56.920
I let all of them know that I'm there for them all day long.

644
00:36:57.070 --> 00:37:00.070
There are certain people on my team who need a meeting with me every single
week.

645
00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:02.530
There's certain people on my team who need to talk to me every day.

646
00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:06.340
There's other people on my team would do really well who I have to go after for

647
00:37:06.341 --> 00:37:07.750
updates.
Right.

648
00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:11.950
And that's just sort of the way they work and so I'm not a big fan of creating

649
00:37:11.951 --> 00:37:14.260
rules and then making team members stick by them.

650
00:37:14.410 --> 00:37:18.310
I want people to be able to move flexibly to be as successful as they possibly

651
00:37:18.311 --> 00:37:23.200
can be and then they just have to set those expectations for themselves.

652
00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:27.280
So like at the end of the year we'll have like a goal meeting and my goal

653
00:37:27.281 --> 00:37:29.050
meeting,
I don't create numbers.

654
00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:32.590
I have them tell me how much money they want to make next year and they have to

655
00:37:32.591 --> 00:37:36.700
make the number.
It's not me.
Right.
If they say like $5 we have to move it up,

656
00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:40.900
but they have to set the number and then we back into that how much they have to

657
00:37:40.901 --> 00:37:42.820
sell to get there.
That's now their base salary.

658
00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.980
Everything else they sell above that is bonus.

659
00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:48.460
If they sell under the number they just said they want to sell and they don't

660
00:37:48.461 --> 00:37:51.220
come talk to me by June or July saying,
listen,

661
00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:54.050
the years terrible New York City real estate market has fallen to the four,

662
00:37:54.051 --> 00:37:57.210
something like that,
then they can't be with me.
Um,

663
00:37:57.340 --> 00:38:01.080
but I talk to my team more than I talk to any other client and I really view

664
00:38:01.081 --> 00:38:04.300
teams as like football teams.
You know,

665
00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:06.340
I'm awful at every sport known to men,

666
00:38:06.490 --> 00:38:10.990
but I do know how football teams work and it's important that everyone can be

667
00:38:10.991 --> 00:38:15.250
their own individual rock star and be successful and be great at what they do.

668
00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:19.060
But you're not all going to win unless you're able to play well together and

669
00:38:19.061 --> 00:38:23.980
work together and talk to each other and figure it out as obstacles come at you

670
00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:28.780
like the New York jets,
you know?
I hope that answers the question.

671
00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:32.290
Okay.
First,
thank you for being here.
Thanks.

672
00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:36.310
I think the yes and figure it out mentality.
Mindset

673
00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:40.360
<v 3>very much resonates with most of us in this room because we invented a category</v>

674
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:44.550
20 years ago.
And I think in some ways we're still doing that.
Yeah.
Um,

675
00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:46.120
personal story.

676
00:38:46.121 --> 00:38:50.440
I met Frederick in Starbucks like eight years ago and I've been here for a
while.

677
00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:52.100
While he was just kidding,

678
00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:56.020
he seemed to be a very different person eight years ago then he is on the show

679
00:38:56.021 --> 00:38:59.650
today.
Yeah.
So is it kind of expecting him to be a Douche and he wasn't?

680
00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:01.270
He was very nice.
Um,

681
00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:04.480
but I've been in sales for 20 years and I recounted a story to him that I had,

682
00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:08.680
I had used a line that I,
I heard on the show on a client.
Oh Wow.
And it worked.

683
00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:09.521
And the line was,

684
00:39:09.521 --> 00:39:12.730
I was working with a very big telecommunications company in the line was if you

685
00:39:12.731 --> 00:39:17.660
have $7 million,
you have $8 billion close,
$8 million,
$8 million deal.

686
00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:19.880
I was like,
oh,
that to you guys,
so thank you.
Yeah.
Um,

687
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:25.150
I have moved out of sales after 20 years and I'm now on a team that's

688
00:39:25.151 --> 00:39:29.770
responsible for training 10,000 sellers at Google.
Oh,
his cell.

689
00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:34.720
And we're at this inflection point between being a trusted advisor and being a

690
00:39:34.721 --> 00:39:37.390
competitive seller because it's a very fine balance.

691
00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:42.280
What do you think are the most important attributes of a seller as they balance

692
00:39:42.281 --> 00:39:44.530
being a trusted advisor and a competitive seller?

693
00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:46.510
<v 1>Okay.</v>

694
00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:48.340
<v 2>Endurance,
empathy and enthusiasm.</v>

695
00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:49.670
<v 1>Ooh,</v>

696
00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:51.100
<v 3>three e's.
I like that a letter.</v>

697
00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:56.030
<v 2>It's in the book.
Okay.
I'm buying it.</v>

698
00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:01.100
It's a,
it's like you didn't just teed me up for that,
but you did sort of,

699
00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:05.270
it's,
it's what I look for in every salesperson that I hire.
Um,

700
00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:09.830
and I do that by,
uh,
like they have to have enthusiasm,
right?

701
00:40:09.831 --> 00:40:11.990
So I asked them to tell me the story about the greatest day of your life.

702
00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:16.010
And if they tell me like,
well,
Christmas when I was 10 was great.

703
00:40:16.070 --> 00:40:20.180
They cannot work with me.
Right?
Um,
they have to have empathy.

704
00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:22.160
So,
um,

705
00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:25.070
I tell them that I asked him to tell me about the worst day they've ever had in

706
00:40:25.071 --> 00:40:26.990
their life and if they're like my dog died,

707
00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:31.520
that cannot work with me because the ability to be enthusiastic with the clients

708
00:40:31.521 --> 00:40:35.330
and the ability to empathize with a client are,

709
00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:37.460
that's the only way you get sales done.

710
00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:40.400
There will always be sales that just come down to numbers.

711
00:40:40.401 --> 00:40:43.340
Like there will always be those conversations.
That was a great,

712
00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:45.490
that's your base salary.
Like those,

713
00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:48.230
those are the deals that are just going to happen because the numbers make sense

714
00:40:48.231 --> 00:40:52.040
in the product's good.
Everything else is empathy,

715
00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:56.240
enthusiasm,
right.
Energy,
education,

716
00:40:56.450 --> 00:40:57.830
all words that start with E.

717
00:40:59.010 --> 00:41:02.490
<v 1>Yeah.
Thank you.
Great.</v>

718
00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:05.543
Anybody else?

719
00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:10.430
<v 2>Oh no,
he's going to the bathroom sites.
Love you too.</v>

720
00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:16.390
<v 3>Oh,
there we go.
Hello.
Hi.
I'm so,</v>

721
00:41:16.391 --> 00:41:21.220
I'll use this opportunity cause I definitely don't have the money to ever work

722
00:41:21.221 --> 00:41:22.390
with you directly.

723
00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:27.550
So if I was an investor and looking for an area in New York,

724
00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:31.390
yeah.
Where I'd like we see the most upside in the next five to 10 years,

725
00:41:31.391 --> 00:41:33.680
what would you recommend?
I do Bushwick.

726
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:37.940
<v 2>Okay.
Yep.
Uh,
Bushwick.
Bedstuy right.</v>

727
00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:43.190
I think that bedstuy is already kind of getting expensive.

728
00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:47.090
Um,
and people are already trying to go there.
I think that Bushwick,

729
00:41:47.450 --> 00:41:51.470
anyone who buys in Bushwick today,
we'll do incredibly well in five years.
Um,

730
00:41:51.830 --> 00:41:56.700
and I,
yeah,
super simple.
You have any listings?
Yes.

731
00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:01.820
Listen,
I am here to sell homes to all of you.
Like,
let's not,

732
00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:04.040
I don't want to meet any of,
I'm going to remember all of you.

733
00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:06.860
I don't want to meet any of you on the street or in Starbucks ever.

734
00:42:06.861 --> 00:42:08.120
And you're like,
oh,
I just bought a house.

735
00:42:08.121 --> 00:42:11.290
But I didn't know if like maybe it was too small for you or I had this friend

736
00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:14.600
know like I am here for a purpose and it's a cell.

737
00:42:14.601 --> 00:42:17.630
All of you homes or help you rent homes.
Okay.

738
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:20.450
Does someone make sure that that's super clear.
So on the left side,

739
00:42:20.451 --> 00:42:23.390
we're going to line up for people that want to buy out her apartment on the

740
00:42:23.391 --> 00:42:27.800
right side.
We're doing the book signing.
Yes.
Yes,
yes,
yes.

741
00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:31.730
<v 3>Right.
And one question,
like given the variety in your background,</v>

742
00:42:32.090 --> 00:42:37.090
how much in the like in your career has it been about what you wanted to do

743
00:42:38.271 --> 00:42:40.010
versus who you want to be?

744
00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:44.820
<v 2>Whoa,
you Googlers.</v>

745
00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:51.660
Um,
I made a decision when I was younger and I think it's,

746
00:42:51.661 --> 00:42:55.230
this is important because I talked to a lot of people who have this problem.

747
00:42:55.650 --> 00:43:00.030
They want to be a really great x,
right?
They want to like you have a night,

748
00:43:00.031 --> 00:43:02.550
like you want to grow up to be like me,
like an actor.
Right?

749
00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:05.390
Or you want to grow up to be a successful banker,

750
00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:08.760
successful engineer or something.
And then when that doesn't happen,

751
00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:12.900
it's like a brick wall to the face and life is over.
Right.

752
00:43:12.901 --> 00:43:14.610
And then they go off and do something else.

753
00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:18.210
Like there's a lot of people who run into those situations where their whole

754
00:43:18.211 --> 00:43:21.690
life they wanted to do something cause they wanted to beat that person.
Um,

755
00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:25.440
but for me,
I,
uh,
whether it sounds crazy or not,

756
00:43:25.441 --> 00:43:28.560
like I always just,
I want it to be successful.

757
00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:33.880
Like I wanted to squeeze as much out of life as possible because I knew life was

758
00:43:34.021 --> 00:43:39.000
short and I knew that I didn't want to leave potential on the floor.

759
00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:43.200
Like I didn't want to be in the cemetery and be one of those people who's like,

760
00:43:43.201 --> 00:43:47.610
wow,
if he'd only just done x,
y,
and Z,
we might know that he did that.

761
00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:52.560
Right.
And so I chose success first,
career second.
Um,

762
00:43:52.770 --> 00:43:56.070
and that's an important thing to put out there because a lot of people think it

763
00:43:56.071 --> 00:43:58.590
sounds weird and crazy and that it doesn't make sense.

764
00:43:58.710 --> 00:44:00.450
But if you choose career first,

765
00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:06.710
I see I could've done that with acting and I wouldn't be here today and I'd

766
00:44:07.081 --> 00:44:10.530
still live in my 300 square foot apartment at 38 west 31st street,

767
00:44:10.531 --> 00:44:14.190
sharing a bathroom with 17 people.
Not that that's a bad thing.
Um,

768
00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:17.130
it's an honorable thing maybe,
but it's,

769
00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:20.280
it wasn't what I wanted for myself and I wanted to have a better quality of life

770
00:44:20.281 --> 00:44:24.810
because again,
life is super short.
Um,
so I chose success first,
career second.

771
00:44:24.811 --> 00:44:28.200
And I think when people do that,
then when things don't work out,

772
00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:32.520
like when I was killed off on as the world turns,
right.
Um,

773
00:44:33.010 --> 00:44:36.690
I think it wasn't this brick wall that I was hitting where my life was over and

774
00:44:36.691 --> 00:44:40.650
I had to move home.
It was okay,
so that career didn't work out.

775
00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:45.240
Let's see what else works and real estate sounds awful.

776
00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:47.880
And real estate brokers have a worst people ever.
But you know what,

777
00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:51.690
maybe I'll try to change that and figure it out and do it in a different way.

778
00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:56.790
And does that answer your question?
Definitely.
Thank you.

779
00:44:56.791 --> 00:45:00.210
Okay,
got it.
All right.
Sometimes I just start going off in my head.

780
00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:03.450
<v 3>Oh,
thank you so much for being here.
Big Fan.
No problem.</v>

781
00:45:03.930 --> 00:45:07.650
I was wondering if you could maybe share about your cast mates on the show.

782
00:45:08.070 --> 00:45:11.610
We've had some friendships,
not friendships.
Are you,

783
00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:15.240
would you consider them friends now and maybe something like unexpected about,

784
00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:17.460
um,
the other brokers who appear on the show.

785
00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:19.040
<v 2>Um,
listen,</v>

786
00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:23.450
I have been on the show from the beginning with Frederick and so we have a love

787
00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:26.060
hate relationship.
Like we are,
because we're competitors,

788
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:28.970
we go after the same projects,
the same listings all the time.

789
00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:34.010
And it took us a while to figure out,
but I think in the last couple of years,

790
00:45:34.070 --> 00:45:35.480
maybe it's just because we're getting older,

791
00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:40.870
like we just realize that we're a lot more alike than we thought.

792
00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:46.430
Um,
I think I'm better,
but
it's,
you know,

793
00:45:46.431 --> 00:45:46.661
we're,

794
00:45:46.661 --> 00:45:51.140
we're both equally competitive and we want to do as best as we possibly can.
Um,

795
00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:54.710
but we're also like in this crazy thing together,
you know,
like,

796
00:45:54.711 --> 00:45:57.980
it's like that show,
like at least when it first came out,

797
00:45:57.981 --> 00:46:00.440
like it was watched by 25 million people around the world.

798
00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:04.520
And it's like crazy to us,
you know,
like I get,

799
00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:07.790
we get fan mail from Korea and Iran,
like deaf.

800
00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:11.660
How would those people would ever know that I'm a real estate broker is beyond

801
00:46:11.661 --> 00:46:15.320
me and I would never be able to afford that type of advertising.
Um,

802
00:46:15.350 --> 00:46:19.940
and so listen,
Frederick and I are friendly now.
Um,
and,

803
00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:23.180
but we're still very competitive.
Um,

804
00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:26.810
I haven't talked to Michael Lorber and forever he was season one.
Luis,

805
00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:31.610
I talked to a lot more now than I have in a long time and he's actually back in

806
00:46:31.611 --> 00:46:32.930
the city and haven't told anyone yet.

807
00:46:32.931 --> 00:46:35.510
But I'll tell people at 3:00 PM on Instagram,

808
00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:39.990
he's going to moderate my book signing at Barnes and noble on Thursday and it's

809
00:46:39.991 --> 00:46:42.980
me,
his first public appearance in like two years.
Um,

810
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:46.820
and I've always been close to Luis and he was at my wedding and everything.

811
00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:51.030
And then Steve is,
Steve is knew Steve Super Pretty.
Um,

812
00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:57.020
and so,
yeah,
but Steve's great.
See you see a total sweetheart.

813
00:46:57.050 --> 00:46:59.360
Um,
he's great at what he does.

814
00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:05.030
He's a lot more sensitive than people probably think.
Um,
yeah.

815
00:47:05.031 --> 00:47:08.960
I don't know if I have any,
did you try and get him to join your team?
I did.

816
00:47:08.961 --> 00:47:13.200
We filmed,
so stay filmed a scene with me after town crumbled,
um,

817
00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:16.580
me trying to get them to come to the team and figure that out because I thought

818
00:47:16.581 --> 00:47:19.430
it would work.
You know,
like with Frederick it wouldn't work.

819
00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:23.840
But with Steve I thought we could probably do more together than separate.

820
00:47:24.110 --> 00:47:27.710
And he thought about it.
And then Corcoran just made him a really great offer,

821
00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:29.030
and then they just cut that whole scene.

822
00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:37.060
<v 0>And that's reality TV.
Yeah,
exactly.
Yes.</v>

823
00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:42.600
So on behalf of the 10,000 potential sales that are in this building and

824
00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:46.300
building,
thank you,
been great having,

825
00:47:46.301 --> 00:47:50.920
you definitely will have people lining up to,
to have you sign their book.

826
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:55.060
You can clearly follow Ryan on Instagram,
Facebook,
Twitter,

827
00:47:55.061 --> 00:47:58.480
and his Youtube Channel,
which highlights a day in the life of Ryan,

828
00:47:58.481 --> 00:48:01.920
which is actually interesting to watch as well.
So good.

829
00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:07.310
<v 1>Thank you.
[inaudible].</v>
