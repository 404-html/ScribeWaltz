Our esteemed guests,
Scooter Braun,

3
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.420
a scooter is one of the biggest entrepreneurs and innovators in entertainment

4
00:00:20.421 --> 00:00:21.920
today.
Uh,

5
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.950
he started as a teenage party promoter is the biggest college party promoter,

6
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.300
uh,
in Atlanta.
While going to Emory,

7
00:00:29.301 --> 00:00:33.510
he leveraged that into a director of marketing position at Soso death in its hay

8
00:00:33.511 --> 00:00:36.170
day.
Uh,
he left,
so,
so def,
uh,

9
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.190
found a little known artist named Justin Bieber.
Uh,

10
00:00:40.191 --> 00:00:44.180
and then basically leverage that into creating,
uh,
the largest,
uh,

11
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.240
or one of the largest media empires,
uh,
in,

12
00:00:47.241 --> 00:00:51.920
in music and entertainment today.
Uh,
SB projects covers all media.

13
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.780
It's not just music.
Uh,
so he obviously manages artists like Kanye west,

14
00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.080
Ariana Grande Day,
Justin Bieber of course,
uh,

15
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.970
Edm acts like Martin Garrix.
Uh,
and then,
you know,
models like Karlie Kloss.

16
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.660
Uh,
it also has a tech incubator arm called silent labs.

17
00:01:08.661 --> 00:01:10.340
We were just talking about it earlier.

18
00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:14.270
They have really impressive investments and Uber,
Spotify ways,

19
00:01:14.271 --> 00:01:18.740
Pinterest to name a few.
So it's track record.
There is a pretty impressive,
uh,

20
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.610
and he's also all about giving back.
So He's on the,
uh,

21
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.600
board of directors of his brothers foundation pencils of promise as well as his

22
00:01:26.601 --> 00:01:29.900
wife's a foundation.
And a,
I don't think we're allowed to curse here.

23
00:01:29.901 --> 00:01:31.850
So fuck cancer.
There you go.

24
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.690
He went for it and that's his wife yell.

25
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.320
Bron I'm also very impressive in her own right.

26
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.530
Please give it up for Scooter Braun.
Thank you so much for coming.

27
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.990
Awesome.
So I actually want to start,
uh,

28
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.370
with your childhood and just set a little context and I want to start with a a

29
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.320
movie you made a student film,
uh,
when you were in high school,

30
00:01:58.321 --> 00:02:02.130
you made a movie about the Jews of Hungary and this had a special kind of place

31
00:02:02.131 --> 00:02:02.491
in your,

32
00:02:02.491 --> 00:02:06.270
in your heritage and you actually got some recognition from Steven Spielberg on

33
00:02:06.271 --> 00:02:10.770
it.
Is that,
is that correct?
Can you,
can you tell us that story?
Um,
I,

34
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.510
<v 2>I went to school and uh,</v>

35
00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.730
my teacher in middle school said there's something called national history day

36
00:02:16.731 --> 00:02:20.390
and no one from our school has ever,
you know,
gone to nationals.

37
00:02:20.391 --> 00:02:23.690
But if you get to nationals,
there's an all expense paid trip to Washington DC.

38
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.580
And I really wanted to go to Washington DC.
I wanted to see the monuments.

39
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.030
I wanted to see everything I'd seen about it.
So I went home that day and I said,

40
00:02:32.031 --> 00:02:35.270
mom,
I'm going to Washington DC.
And she said,
you're crazy.
She goes,

41
00:02:35.271 --> 00:02:37.820
what are you talking about?
And I came up with this idea.

42
00:02:37.821 --> 00:02:39.830
So my grandparents are Holocaust survivors.

43
00:02:39.831 --> 00:02:41.960
My grandmother was a liberated from Bergen.

44
00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:45.920
Belsen was an Auschwitz and my grandfather wasn't dot Kao.
Um,

45
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.010
and I was always kind of fascinated by the story of how they could just live in

46
00:02:51.651 --> 00:02:54.680
this country and live a normal life like I was living at the time.

47
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.460
And then suddenly their country just betrays them.
And you know,

48
00:02:58.461 --> 00:03:01.600
everyone in their family dies and they're the only survivors.
Uh,

49
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.590
so I decided to do a 10 minute documentary called the Hungarian conflict.

50
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.460
And it was the story of how,
um,

51
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.550
hundreds of thousands of Jews were deported over two weeks voluntarily by the,

52
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.840
the German people and the German army towards the end of the war.
Um,

53
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.850
and submitted it,
won regionals,
one states,

54
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.780
uh,

55
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.510
lost in nationals to a documentary about airplanes that make loud noises and fly

56
00:03:27.511 --> 00:03:32.020
over a neighborhood in Chicago.
Um,
because that is the most important topic.

57
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.370
That can be a story about the Holocaust.
Uh,
I'm not bitter.
I'm 36.

58
00:03:36.371 --> 00:03:40.960
I've let go of it.
Uh,
and,
but actually I had an amazing time.

59
00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:44.170
I got to go down there and made a lot of friends and,
uh,
I was 13,

60
00:03:44.171 --> 00:03:48.520
14 years old and when I came back,
um,
my other grandmother,

61
00:03:48.521 --> 00:03:52.690
my mom's mother,
she was very proud and she sent it in to the Holocaust museum.

62
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.100
And somehow someone,
uh,
got it to Steven Spielberg,

63
00:03:57.101 --> 00:03:59.770
she had sent it to his office,
everyone else,
cause he had the show a foundation.

64
00:03:59.771 --> 00:04:02.320
He was collecting information about Holocaust survivors at the time.

65
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.470
And I had no contact entertainment.

66
00:04:05.471 --> 00:04:07.540
No one in my family had a contact entertainment.

67
00:04:07.541 --> 00:04:12.190
We knew no one in the world right now,
work in.
And one day in the mail,

68
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.880
I get this letter from the office of Steven Spielberg and a letter,
um,

69
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.970
typed out on his letterhead,

70
00:04:18.971 --> 00:04:23.200
signed by him talking about my film and encouraging me to keep going.

71
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.730
And I framed it and it's been on my wall ever since.
When I went to college.

72
00:04:27.731 --> 00:04:31.420
It was on my wall,
it's on the wall in my Home Office now.
Uh,

73
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.840
and it made me believe that I could really achieve anything.

74
00:04:34.841 --> 00:04:39.490
Like if a kid who had no context could get to Steven Spielberg,
I thought,

75
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.990
you know,
anything is possible.
Uh,
and funny enough,
um,

76
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.140
about 17 years later,

77
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.760
I was at the White House press dinner with a client and they moved us into a

78
00:04:51.761 --> 00:04:55.840
private room,
uh,
with celebrities because they didn't want the press.

79
00:04:55.841 --> 00:04:59.630
Just hounding these celebrities in the big room before,
uh,

80
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.450
the event with the president started and Steven Spielberg was in the room and he

81
00:05:04.451 --> 00:05:06.820
started talking to us and I said,
listen,
I don't mean to interrupt,

82
00:05:06.821 --> 00:05:09.550
but I just need to tell you.
Years ago when I was a kid,

83
00:05:09.551 --> 00:05:12.700
I did a video about the Holocaust.
And you,
and before I can get a word out,

84
00:05:12.701 --> 00:05:14.860
he goes,
you didn't do the Hungarian one,
did you?

85
00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.890
And he remembered 17 years later and I was completely in shock.

86
00:05:20.891 --> 00:05:24.190
And it's just a testament to who he is and how genuine he is.

87
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.170
And it was just very encouraging.
I still have it on my wall.
Uh,
to this day

88
00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:31.850
<v 3>you mentioned something pretty remarkable,</v>

89
00:05:31.851 --> 00:05:34.610
which is that you started off knowing no one and entertainment.

90
00:05:34.611 --> 00:05:37.070
Now you'd know everybody in entertainment.

91
00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.460
So if the first inflection point was kind of Steven Spielberg giving you

92
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.450
recognition in that giving you kind of the,

93
00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.190
just the belief in yourself to do anything after that.

94
00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.420
A second inflection point is,
you know,
cut to Atlanta,
uh,

95
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.850
you're throwing parties for,
for rappers like ludicrous and M and.
M.

96
00:05:52.851 --> 00:05:56.210
How exactly did that come about?
Um,

97
00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.270
Atlanta

98
00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:02.990
<v 2>is an,
Atlanta was racist and that's the reason it happened.</v>

99
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.920
I,
uh,

100
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.990
I went down to Atlanta to play basketball and broke my dad's heart cause I took

101
00:06:08.991 --> 00:06:12.830
a d three offer instead of a d one offer because d one said,
hi,

102
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:18.230
you're five 11 and can't really jump or run that fast.
So nice jump shot,

103
00:06:18.231 --> 00:06:19.730
you're going to sit the bench for the first two years.

104
00:06:19.731 --> 00:06:23.300
And I didn't really like that.
So I was like,
okay,
I'm going to go play d three.

105
00:06:23.301 --> 00:06:26.180
I'm going to get,
you know,
come out and start and get playing time.

106
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.960
And I got down to Atlanta and no one cared about our team and my best friend was

107
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.790
at Duke and he was the star of that team.
And uh,

108
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.710
we played Aau basketball against each other.
So that's how we knew each other.

109
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.950
And um,
when I got down there,

110
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.030
because I came from an Aau basketball team where I was one,

111
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.070
I was a minority on my team.

112
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.690
I was one of three white guys on a majority black basketball team and our team,

113
00:06:50.691 --> 00:06:54.500
since we were 14 years old in our state,
we every weekend,

114
00:06:54.501 --> 00:06:55.550
three to four months out of the year,

115
00:06:55.551 --> 00:06:58.280
we were in hotel rooms together as brothers.
I mean,

116
00:06:58.281 --> 00:07:00.140
these guys are still to this day,
my brothers,

117
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:02.870
I have to explain to my wife and one of them calls like,
well,

118
00:07:02.871 --> 00:07:05.210
I've never even met this person.
You're just gonna let him sleep in our house.

119
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:10.280
And I,
you know,
said in my childhood,
this is,
this is family.
Um,

120
00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:11.480
so when I got to Atlanta,

121
00:07:11.481 --> 00:07:15.390
I didn't really have that perspective of white people went to clubs that played

122
00:07:15.391 --> 00:07:19.250
techno and black people went to clubs to play hip hop and there was no mixing.

123
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.850
So I didn't like that.
And I saw an open,
excuse me,

124
00:07:22.851 --> 00:07:27.020
I saw an opening and I needed a,
I need to legit money.

125
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:31.110
Um,
because I was broke and uh,

126
00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:35.690
selling fake ids was not a longterm plan.
Um,

127
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:40.610
so I stopped by this club called chaos in bucket,
uh,
back in the day.

128
00:07:40.611 --> 00:07:44.510
And I said,
if you let me bring people here,
would you pay me?
And he goes,

129
00:07:44.511 --> 00:07:47.320
well how many people can you bring?
I said,
how many do you hold?
And he said,
800.

130
00:07:47.321 --> 00:07:49.640
And I said,
that sounds about right.
I didn't know what I was doing.

131
00:07:49.641 --> 00:07:51.230
I went to Kinko's,
I made flyers,

132
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:56.390
I named my company Kryptonite entertainment cause I like Superman.
Um,

133
00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.010
and uh,

134
00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:02.300
I had a bunch of freshmen girls pass out flyers for me cause I had a high school

135
00:08:02.301 --> 00:08:03.134
sweetheart.

136
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:07.070
So the freshmen girls weren't threatened by me because I would dance and have

137
00:08:07.071 --> 00:08:11.090
fun,
but I wasn't trying to sleep with them because I was loyal to my high school

138
00:08:11.091 --> 00:08:15.860
sweetheart.
And,
uh,
where the freshmen girls tell you to go,

139
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:20.360
it seems like the rest of the campus went.
Um,
and next thing you know,

140
00:08:20.361 --> 00:08:24.530
I had 800 people there.
And this is a long story,
but,
uh,

141
00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:27.490
sorry for taking so long,
that first party,
um,

142
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:30.440
someone approached me and he was like,
this party is amazing.

143
00:08:30.441 --> 00:08:34.010
Look at all of these kids,
different diversity,
you know,
listen to hip hop.

144
00:08:34.011 --> 00:08:37.190
And I looked at him,
I was like,
you're Michael Jackson.
And No,

145
00:08:37.191 --> 00:08:38.180
it was not Michael Jackson,

146
00:08:38.181 --> 00:08:41.990
but it was Jason Weaver who played young Michael Jackson and the Ph one movie

147
00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:45.620
that I would watch every single year when they'd play about the Jacksons.

148
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.100
And he was like,
yeah,
I'm,
I'm a on a different TV show now.

149
00:08:49.101 --> 00:08:53.360
That was like 10 years ago,
dude.
And um,
he said,

150
00:08:53.361 --> 00:08:55.170
do you want to see how the other half lives?
And I said,

151
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:58.500
what do you mean the other half?
He goes,
black people.
And um,

152
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.450
he took me to velvet room on a Tuesday night,
uh,
this,

153
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.160
this guy from members,
old Atlanta,

154
00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:11.040
so the original velvet room.
And,
um,

155
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:15.350
there's a guy named Alex get a one who is now one of the biggest club owners in

156
00:09:15.351 --> 00:09:19.350
Atlanta who originally started off as an Ethiopian immigrant parking lot

157
00:09:19.351 --> 00:09:24.150
attendant.
And at that point he become a huge promoter.
Uh,
and he had a stutter,

158
00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:28.920
still does.
And he was so fascinated that I was there that he said,

159
00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.740
let the white boy and,

160
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:36.870
and he let me in for free instead of paying the hundred dollars a head cutline

161
00:09:36.871 --> 00:09:38.550
charge.
Um,

162
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:43.290
and I would put parties on every Thursday for college kids and spend every

163
00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:48.210
dollar of it on Tuesday's meeting.
People basically faking it till I made it.

164
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:51.360
Um,
and then I bought,

165
00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:54.690
I made so much cash with the parties because Alex really taught me how to

166
00:09:54.691 --> 00:09:57.300
promote.
I learned what I really deserve to make it those parties.

167
00:09:57.301 --> 00:10:00.960
I started making the door part of the bar and he educated me,
uh,

168
00:10:00.961 --> 00:10:04.260
and I bought a purple Mercedes with rims on Ebay

169
00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:10.050
and I started driving that to the party and so I can really floss and get

170
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.320
everyone's attention.
And they were like,
who is this kid?
I was like,

171
00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:16.530
you should come to my parties.
And I said,
we're playing hip hop too.

172
00:10:16.531 --> 00:10:20.460
And I started getting basically all these rappers of Atlanta started coming to

173
00:10:20.461 --> 00:10:23.970
my events and I wasn't paying them and they were coming for free and have a good

174
00:10:23.971 --> 00:10:27.690
time.
And the first artist I ever worked at my parties was,

175
00:10:27.691 --> 00:10:30.960
I'm a DJ in Atlanta called Chris level lava,

176
00:10:30.961 --> 00:10:34.620
who had an alternate personality named ludicrous and he had a record called

177
00:10:34.621 --> 00:10:38.040
throw them bows.
And that was the first record I ever worked.
Uh,

178
00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:41.490
and that's how I kind of got on the scene.
And then one day I'm,

179
00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:45.300
Jermaine Dupri called me and he was,
he came to Atlanta was a big billboard,

180
00:10:45.301 --> 00:10:50.070
used to say,
welcome the homeless.
So,
so death.
And he was on top of his game.

181
00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:51.000
A lot of people don't know this.

182
00:10:51.001 --> 00:10:54.330
Jermaine Dupri is the only producer in music to have a number one on the

183
00:10:54.331 --> 00:10:59.010
billboard charts for 16 years straight,
um,
more than Quincy Jones.

184
00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:00.960
And,
uh,

185
00:11:00.961 --> 00:11:04.890
Jermaine asked me to come meet with him and Jermaine is not a tall man.

186
00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.800
So we met and he,

187
00:11:07.801 --> 00:11:11.820
his feet were dangling from this chair and he was talking to me and I was just

188
00:11:11.821 --> 00:11:16.110
so fascinated with his feet,
didn't touch the ground.
Um,
and uh,

189
00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:20.400
and he asked me to come help him run his company and do marketing.

190
00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.190
I was 20 years old and I became the vice president of marketing.

191
00:11:23.191 --> 00:11:25.770
It's so set of records.
Amazing.

192
00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:29.400
That was a long roundabout way of answering one question.
No,

193
00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:32.460
he bought what he told me before we started that when it's about Crypto,

194
00:11:32.461 --> 00:11:33.480
this place is packed.

195
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:40.350
So should we just talk about crypto?
Like you just,
just,
just put the word out.

196
00:11:40.351 --> 00:11:42.570
Just be like,
Yo,
it's not what you think.
It's not about,

197
00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:46.290
not about Kanye and people are,
it's about crypto.
Get in there right now.

198
00:11:46.291 --> 00:11:51.180
We're talking about with theory them.
It's getting crazy in here.
That's awesome.

199
00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:54.580
This is,
that guy has tips.
It's got information on quant stamp.

200
00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:01.430
No,
no ICO talk unfortunately.
But that,
that was incredible.
Uh,

201
00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:05.350
I don't think I've ever heard that story at that level of detail.
So,
uh,
okay.

202
00:12:05.351 --> 00:12:09.580
So you're,
you're,
you know,
a director of marketing at so,
so def,
uh,

203
00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:12.700
talk about your kind of a decision to leave.
So,

204
00:12:12.701 --> 00:12:16.060
so death and then you want the truth to the Nice version.

205
00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:20.700
I want the two of you guys want,
what do we want?
Uh,

206
00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:26.230
how many people see this 700 k subscribers?

207
00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:30.000
Okay,
Justin us.
Um,
but you have finite it,
right.

208
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:33.670
Jermaine changed my life because he gave me an opportunity and he,

209
00:12:33.671 --> 00:12:34.331
and he knows this.

210
00:12:34.331 --> 00:12:37.480
I actually just was down in Atlanta and we spent the night hanging out together.

211
00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:41.530
Um,
I'm incredibly grateful the guys like him,
Shaka Zulu,

212
00:12:41.531 --> 00:12:44.440
who was ludicrous as manager who put me in a guy named [inaudible] Stewart,

213
00:12:44.441 --> 00:12:48.520
who unfortunately is no longer with us,
who brought me into the music game.
Um,

214
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:52.920
guys like Steve Rifkind who gave me my first record deal for Asher Roth.
Um,

215
00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:56.770
and these,
these guys really changed my life.
But,
uh,

216
00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:00.850
at the time I had all these ideas about social media and how to break acts and

217
00:13:00.851 --> 00:13:03.370
Jermaine wasn't listening to me.
Um,

218
00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:06.460
he was really focused on what he was focused on and just wanted me to kind of

219
00:13:06.461 --> 00:13:09.130
promote what he wanted.
And um,

220
00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:12.070
I had to go to London for something,

221
00:13:12.071 --> 00:13:15.490
something other project I was consulting for.
And while I was over there,

222
00:13:15.491 --> 00:13:18.880
I ran into little job.
And a lot of people don't know this,
but for nine years,

223
00:13:18.881 --> 00:13:20.180
little John worked as an ANR.

224
00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:23.800
It's so sort of records before he became little John and we started talking,

225
00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:26.080
he said,
don't take nine years.
He goes,

226
00:13:26.081 --> 00:13:29.200
I wouldn't have become a little and wouldn't have the success I'm having now if

227
00:13:29.201 --> 00:13:31.960
I took this long.
And we had,
you know,
just had yeah.

228
00:13:31.961 --> 00:13:36.100
With usher and he produced that.
We executive produced that album.
Um,

229
00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:38.530
and that was really resonating in my head.
And when I came back,

230
00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.920
I would say I had one foot out the door,
but I was scared,
you know,

231
00:13:41.921 --> 00:13:45.550
I wanted to chase my dreams.
I wanted to pursue what I wanted to pursue.

232
00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:49.540
But I had built this identity at 23 years old over the three years I was at

233
00:13:49.541 --> 00:13:52.920
remain,
you know,
almost 24 at that point.
Um,

234
00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:58.810
and I was afraid of stepping away as much as I didn't want to be there because I

235
00:13:58.811 --> 00:14:00.970
think a lot of people,
you know,
you guys work for a company,

236
00:14:00.971 --> 00:14:04.060
so a lot of you probably have entrepreneurial spirits and want to do something,

237
00:14:04.061 --> 00:14:08.290
but there's something about the steady paycheck that's crippling.
Um,

238
00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:12.160
and Jermaine's mother came into the office,

239
00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:16.480
she had an office,
don't ask why.
Um,

240
00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:19.630
and for some reason that day she was just in a mood and wanted to tell everyone

241
00:14:19.631 --> 00:14:23.950
who worked there that her son doesn't need any of them and he makes all the

242
00:14:23.951 --> 00:14:28.750
money and all you people are just overhead.
And I said,
look,
with all due respect,

243
00:14:28.751 --> 00:14:32.060
I have my own company and promotion separately for this,
but I love your son,

244
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:35.230
but I don't have to be here.
And I don't really appreciate you saying that.

245
00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.480
So could you know,
chill a little bit.

246
00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:41.850
And I was being respectful and she looked at me and said something,
uh,

247
00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:45.790
that out of respect for him,
I will not repeat,
um,

248
00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:47.890
because that's his mom and,

249
00:14:47.891 --> 00:14:52.891
but it was disrespectful and completely inappropriate and hurtful.

250
00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:58.040
And I'm not just to me,
but to people beyond me as an individual.

251
00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:03.260
And,
uh,
I decided instead of saying something back,
I just left.

252
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.440
And when I got back to the office the next day and kind of calm down,

253
00:15:06.441 --> 00:15:10.040
didn't worry about it.
Um,
she had a letter in my mailbox firing me.

254
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:13.790
Um,
and,

255
00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:16.760
but what killed me was it was signed also by him.

256
00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:20.710
So I went over to see him and I'm like,
what the hell?
And he's like,
man,

257
00:15:20.711 --> 00:15:23.300
it's my mom.
Just give you two weeks and I'll straighten it out.

258
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:29.120
And that was all I needed to know.
Uh,
and I remember taking my car,

259
00:15:29.121 --> 00:15:31.100
driving over to Kroger by my house,

260
00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:35.120
sitting on the hood of my car and realizing as scared as I was,

261
00:15:35.121 --> 00:15:39.380
this was the opportunity actually really did want and the universe forced it on

262
00:15:39.381 --> 00:15:43.130
me.
Um,
and universe has a way of doing that and your life feel like you,
you,

263
00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:44.870
you really want to do something and you're holding back,

264
00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.180
holding back and then you think something bad happened.

265
00:15:47.181 --> 00:15:50.560
It's just the university usually correcting something for you.
Um,

266
00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:55.670
and that sent me out on my own track and I,

267
00:15:55.671 --> 00:16:00.650
uh,
I'm grateful she decided to say some crazy shit to me.
Sorry,

268
00:16:00.651 --> 00:16:03.470
Google for cursing again.
You know,

269
00:16:03.471 --> 00:16:05.890
you can search curse words.

270
00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:09.430
<v 4>Google.
Right.
That's true.
They do show up and you can search them.
Yeah.</v>

271
00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:11.710
You guys actually don't block anything that you're saying.

272
00:16:11.711 --> 00:16:13.060
You can't say that's true.

273
00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:17.560
I actually don't even know what the official policy is.
Well,
my question is,
is,

274
00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.920
you know,
especially with so many languages you have around the world.
Yeah.

275
00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:24.130
I would challenge you right now with the cameras.

276
00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:26.110
I want you to pick any curse word you want,

277
00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.620
but I want you to say it right now because I want to,

278
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:30.790
I want to release this for you.
I want to give you,

279
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:34.750
I want to give you this freedom.
So I'm going to,

280
00:16:34.751 --> 00:16:37.450
we're going to just count to three and you're going to say a curse word.

281
00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:40.660
I'm going to say a curse word.
Yeah.
One,
two,
three shit.

282
00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:45.490
Give him a round of applause.
That was very scary for him.

283
00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:48.610
And I want to let you know that you were let go about two seconds.

284
00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:53.580
<v 3>You realize I want for the most PG curse where it was pretty,
it was pretty weak,</v>

285
00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:57.870
but it's cool.
Thank you for that.
Skewed it.

286
00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:02.210
Wow.
So we're talking about crypto in here.
That's right.
Get in.

287
00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:05.040
We got scooter coin is coming up actually.
Oh hell no

288
00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:11.180
one will not make it past the bubble.
Um,

289
00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:16.200
okay,
so you leave.
So,
so def,
uh,
kind of an abrupt ending there.

290
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:19.780
Uh,
talk about the time in between.
So,

291
00:17:19.781 --> 00:17:23.520
so def and finding Justin Bieber and then how exactly you found Justin Bieber on

292
00:17:23.521 --> 00:17:28.140
youtube,
right.
Thanks guys.
Well done.
Um,

293
00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:31.020
yeah,
that worked out well for me.

294
00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:38.400
Just a grown man in the middle of the night and his underwear,

295
00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:43.440
the internet staring at little boys singing and look at my life now.

296
00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:50.010
I wasn't even arrested.
It was good.
Um,
actually I have to get,
that's not true.
I

297
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:51.630
<v 2>got arrested in Long Island for Justin,</v>

298
00:17:51.631 --> 00:17:55.410
so maybe that was the reason I'm going to ask about that later.
Yeah,

299
00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:57.510
that was just a mall that things are crazy.

300
00:17:57.511 --> 00:18:02.070
I was the first arrest in US history for refusing to tweet Jesus.

301
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.160
Um,
long story.
We don't have to go there.
You guys can look it up.

302
00:18:05.161 --> 00:18:08.520
My records expunged so I can get global entry again.
It's awesome.

303
00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:13.950
Um,
all right.
In between,
I,
uh,

304
00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:17.310
I needed a calling card,
so I went back to the original guy,
ludicrous.

305
00:18:17.311 --> 00:18:19.380
A bill O'Reilly.
Um,

306
00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:23.760
he had said ludicrous as a gangster rapper and,
and you know,

307
00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:24.900
companies shouldn't work with him.

308
00:18:24.901 --> 00:18:27.630
And suddenly companies believe Bill O'reilly for some reason and ludicrous,

309
00:18:27.631 --> 00:18:32.520
lost all his endorsements,
Pepsi,
everything.
Um,
and I was like,

310
00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.620
if you guys give me a shot,
I'll find you something.

311
00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:38.970
And he was in an amazing movie called crash that was coming out.
Uh,

312
00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:44.480
and my buddy knew someone at Pontiac and said,
hey there,
you know,

313
00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:47.520
maybe go there.
They're doing the solstice.
I heard they have a budget.

314
00:18:47.521 --> 00:18:51.930
So I called pretend I was in a college report or trying to do,

315
00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:55.650
how do you guys do endorsement deals?
And they told me the name of their agency.

316
00:18:55.651 --> 00:18:57.330
I went to the agency and said the same thing,

317
00:18:57.331 --> 00:19:01.890
I'm a college kid doing a report on this,
would you like to speak to me?
And,
um,

318
00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:05.040
got to the woman,
said,
look,
there's no report here.

319
00:19:05.041 --> 00:19:07.260
This is what it's really about.
And she goes,
I don't know about ludicrous.

320
00:19:07.261 --> 00:19:10.920
And I said,
look,
come to the premiere of crash with me and if you,
you'll see.

321
00:19:10.921 --> 00:19:14.550
And when she saw crashed and saw him in it,
she said,
I love this.

322
00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:19.530
And we did a deal for the Pontiac solstice.
Uh,
I took his song two miles an hour.

323
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:22.980
Um,
I've never told this story,
so this is,

324
00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:26.730
I'll never get another deal Pontiac after I tell this.
Uh,
so like I said,

325
00:19:26.731 --> 00:19:29.250
I really have anything,
like I was kinda going week to week still.

326
00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:32.790
They started throwing parties again to kind of get paid.
Um,

327
00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:34.500
and um,

328
00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:39.960
I got them to agree to let us shoot the video with one of our music video

329
00:19:39.961 --> 00:19:43.410
directors and we would make a music video with the Pontiac solstice and then

330
00:19:43.411 --> 00:19:46.470
give them 30 seconds,
a minute clips to actually make it to their commercial.

331
00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:49.920
And it was a huge $10 million campaign.
Uh,

332
00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:52.200
but the Pontiac at the time was still a prototype,

333
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:54.810
like they hadn't started sending out the actual cars.

334
00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:56.120
So you know anything about cars.

335
00:19:56.130 --> 00:20:00.960
The prototypes are like $2 million each because it's not the actual car,

336
00:20:00.961 --> 00:20:05.160
it's the model.
Um,
so we needed it for the video.

337
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.880
So they send it bent down and you're not supposed to drive it.
It drives,

338
00:20:08.881 --> 00:20:12.060
it's a car,
but you know,
it's a $2 million prototype car.

339
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:16.260
But I didn't have money to put it on a flatbed and take it across town.

340
00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:20.280
So I drove the $2 million car down the highway,

341
00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:25.800
literally like freaking out the whole way and got it to the video.

342
00:20:25.801 --> 00:20:28.980
And to this day,
no one knows I did that.
Um,

343
00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:33.420
but now it's 800,000 people just found out.
Uh,

344
00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:35.580
and that was kind of my calling card.
And people are like,

345
00:20:35.581 --> 00:20:38.310
this is before Jay z had to deal with Nike and you know,

346
00:20:38.311 --> 00:20:40.790
rappers and hip hop didn't really have endorsement deals.

347
00:20:40.791 --> 00:20:43.500
So people started hearing about the fact that I was able to pull it off.

348
00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:47.590
And then,
um,
I did a party for him,
uh,

349
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:51.570
for the anger management or with Anam and got showtime to sponsor it with their

350
00:20:51.571 --> 00:20:52.570
show soul food.

351
00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:56.410
And I started using this as a calling card and I was doing consulting and

352
00:20:56.411 --> 00:20:59.770
marketing for hip hop and R and B acts all over Atlanta and then around the

353
00:20:59.771 --> 00:21:00.604
industry.

354
00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:04.480
And I decided I'm gonna Start my own company because of all these ideas about

355
00:21:04.481 --> 00:21:07.900
social media.
And I found a kid on my space name Asher Roth,
um,

356
00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:09.850
who didn't even have a mix tape out,

357
00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:15.040
but I just liked his lyrics and I had an idea about,

358
00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:16.953
you know,

359
00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:20.590
a part of rap that it's very common now but wasn't being represented at the
time.

360
00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:25.450
Um,
cause you had M and m and that was just it from,
you know,
white boys.

361
00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:30.190
Uh,
and flew Asher down to Atlanta,

362
00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:34.030
got him to move on to my couch and we just started that process.

363
00:21:34.031 --> 00:21:35.470
Then I got him a house around the corner.

364
00:21:35.471 --> 00:21:40.471
They was like filled with rats and got my old college djs when I was a big part

365
00:21:41.291 --> 00:21:44.080
of weren't in college.
They were two guys that were,

366
00:21:44.081 --> 00:21:49.050
I'm going to Clark and Morehouse and that was Dj,
um,

367
00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:53.140
trauma and DJ cannon.
And they had become big mix tape Dj.

368
00:21:53.141 --> 00:21:56.620
So I got them to do a mix tape for Asher cause we kind of came up together.

369
00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:01.630
And when Ashley Rhode Island College for months after finding Asher,

370
00:22:01.631 --> 00:22:03.520
I found Justin [inaudible] on Youtube,

371
00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:06.400
flew him in his mother down on the first plane ride.

372
00:22:06.401 --> 00:22:11.290
Either of them had ever been on,
put them illegally,
uh,
Donald Trump into,

373
00:22:11.291 --> 00:22:15.550
um,
into house.
It's Canadians.
He's not as threatened.

374
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:18.130
Uh,
uh,

375
00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:22.930
we can talk about it all that later and uh,
had them living around.

376
00:22:22.931 --> 00:22:24.430
And when we wrote aisle of college,

377
00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:28.720
Justin was actually sitting there as a 14 year old kid.

378
00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:33.140
And,
um,
it was kind of this little family unit that we had.
Um,

379
00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:38.230
and uh,
since I see like a lot of young people here,

380
00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:42.970
uh,
strange,
I didn't know Google had so many young employees.
Uh,

381
00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:47.310
just it's so against your reputation.
Um,
and

382
00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:54.070
I was 25.
I had Justin living in a townhouse under my name with Aaron's rents,

383
00:22:54.071 --> 00:22:56.740
furniture that I bought.
Um,

384
00:22:56.830 --> 00:23:01.690
and Asher living in a house around the corner from him and this decrepit rat

385
00:23:01.691 --> 00:23:04.900
filled the house with his buddies that just came with him and dropped out of

386
00:23:04.901 --> 00:23:07.030
college with him.
Um,

387
00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:11.680
and I had my apartment and I had money for 13 months before I went broke and I

388
00:23:11.681 --> 00:23:16.450
wasn't doing parties.
I was pot committed.
I was in it,
burn the ships,

389
00:23:16.451 --> 00:23:17.980
I was there.
And that was that.

390
00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:22.160
And I was in a month 11 my dad called me just to try to check out.

391
00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:25.940
And I remember being 25 and just breaking down hysterically crying on the phone

392
00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:29.590
saying I'm a failure.
And nobody in Atlanta knows,
everyone thinks I'm killing it.

393
00:23:29.591 --> 00:23:30.730
Everyone thinks I'm doing it.

394
00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:34.510
And I'm two months away from losing it all and I haven't done anything with you

395
00:23:34.511 --> 00:23:37.360
know,
for these guys yet.
And he goes,
well,
you've come this far,

396
00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:41.010
two more months to see what happens in the next day.
Asher,
Rhode Island College.

397
00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:42.273
Um,

398
00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:47.280
and within the two months I was able to pull off hyping a publishing deal at

399
00:23:47.541 --> 00:23:49.850
south by southwest.
Um,

400
00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:53.360
I had one publisher meet me at a restaurant across the street from the other,

401
00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:57.690
so I made sure they saw each other and created a bidding war.
Uh,

402
00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:00.980
got Asher a million dollar pub deal.
Took the commission to that,

403
00:24:00.981 --> 00:24:04.970
saved my company and never look back.

404
00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:08.360
And that's,
that's pretty much the way I would describe to you.

405
00:24:08.361 --> 00:24:13.010
That's how close failure and success actually are.
There's a very fine line.

406
00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:16.490
And to get to success you have to walk right next to failure.
And um,

407
00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:19.010
I've paid for pizza would change.

408
00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:23.690
I've cried on the phone at 25 years old and it's funny,

409
00:24:23.691 --> 00:24:28.610
actually think I'm 36 now.
It's been 11 years and my life is very different.

410
00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:34.100
Um,
and I'm glad I learned that lesson.
This is awesome.

411
00:24:34.101 --> 00:24:36.380
This might be the most candid interview I've ever given,

412
00:24:36.381 --> 00:24:41.120
so I appreciate you better than my brother.
Yes.
I don't know.
I can't,
no,

413
00:24:41.121 --> 00:24:45.230
I can't say yes.
You say yes,
it's on record.
Sorry Adam,
if you're watching,

414
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:50.390
I'm sorry.
I mean,
he did great.
He,
he interviewed my brother and in SF last week,

415
00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:54.530
last week,
a few weeks ago,
three weeks ago.
My brother is very impressive.

416
00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:59.500
He's mom's favorite.
I'm older.
He's a lot more impressive.
Uh,

417
00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:01.430
if you guys could look into mission,

418
00:25:01.431 --> 00:25:04.820
you or pencils of promise or the fact that at 32,

419
00:25:04.821 --> 00:25:09.650
he was the UN global education crisis committee head.
Um,
yeah.
He's like,

420
00:25:09.651 --> 00:25:12.140
yeah,
he's like,
that guy is 100% mom.

421
00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:16.580
Mom loves him and my sister mom loves even more than,
it's not even close.

422
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.850
He says he gets very competitive with you in basketball.
Yeah,

423
00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:24.970
I mean our dad's a coach so we like grew up playing competitive basketball whole

424
00:25:25.341 --> 00:25:29.960
lives and Adam is a better athlete and definitely has a better handle.

425
00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:32.760
Um,
but he's jumped shots week.

426
00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:36.830
I definitely have the best jumps in on the family.
He won't contest that.

427
00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:41.630
But that's all I got taken shots.
But it's real and that's good.

428
00:25:41.631 --> 00:25:42.500
And as you get older,

429
00:25:42.501 --> 00:25:46.280
like my game is more efficient because as you get older and you have a jump
shot,

430
00:25:46.281 --> 00:25:49.040
you can survive three point line.
The three point line.

431
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.730
I like how there's like three people in here who are basketball fans and

432
00:25:52.731 --> 00:25:55.760
everyone else's.
Get back to the crypto talk bro.

433
00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:58.920
Get back to the crypto w we have more velvet room goers

434
00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:02.790
<v 3>then basketball fans.
Uh,
okay.
So that's,
that's crazy.</v>

435
00:26:02.791 --> 00:26:07.791
It's almost like Asher gave you the runway to do what you did with Justin,

436
00:26:08.551 --> 00:26:12.480
which is maybe a little known fact,
which is that,
that's pretty incredible.

437
00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:16.140
When you,
when you saw Justin,
uh,
on Youtube,

438
00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:19.380
you flew him out,
you flew him and his mother out,
and you've got this,

439
00:26:19.381 --> 00:26:23.250
this trial period and you got them to take a chance on you.
How did you know,

440
00:26:23.251 --> 00:26:27.060
like this kid special?
Just from seeing him,
you know,
on,
on Youtube,

441
00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:28.050
<v 2>you know,</v>

442
00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:33.050
a manager of a great new rising artists actually came to see me last night in my

443
00:26:33.501 --> 00:26:36.590
house and it was our first time meeting and kind of just wanted to get to know

444
00:26:36.591 --> 00:26:39.290
each other and we were talking,
he's a really good dude.

445
00:26:39.291 --> 00:26:41.810
And we were talking about,
you know,
data and different things.

446
00:26:41.811 --> 00:26:44.600
And I just looked at him,
I said,
look,
I remember,
um,

447
00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:49.080
when Sean Parker woke me up one night to tell me that he was going to create an

448
00:26:49.081 --> 00:26:52.890
algorithm for a hit song.
And you know,

449
00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:57.810
it's not the first time I'd heard something like that.
You know,

450
00:26:57.811 --> 00:26:59.350
when you asked me how did,
I know

451
00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:04.620
I like going with gut,
that is a great thing.

452
00:27:04.621 --> 00:27:06.870
But going with gut is a much better way to live.

453
00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:11.470
And if everybody could take data and figured out then,

454
00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:15.340
then there would not be,
you know,
hit songs.
There wouldn't be,
you know,

455
00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:17.730
movies there were,
there wouldn't be innovation.

456
00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:21.570
We would just be following data and following some kind of timeline of how we're

457
00:27:21.571 --> 00:27:26.400
supposed to do things.
And then,
uh,
you know,
there's no,

458
00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:28.380
there's no sensation of discovery.

459
00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:33.390
And I think data is very important because you can learn from it and you'd go

460
00:27:33.391 --> 00:27:37.500
with it.
But if you go through life,
I mean,

461
00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:42.120
everyone in this room will understand this.
If someone gives you a ton of data,

462
00:27:42.121 --> 00:27:46.710
but your gut just tells you it's wrong,
but you follow the data and it's wrong,

463
00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:50.100
you're miserable.
You are like,
I knew it.

464
00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:52.350
I absolutely knew what this drives me crazy.

465
00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:57.810
But if you go against the data and you follow your gut and you're still wrong,

466
00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.930
you actually don't feel bad.
You're like,
you know what?
I tried,

467
00:28:00.931 --> 00:28:03.930
I went with my gut.
And what's the point of really doing anything?

468
00:28:03.931 --> 00:28:07.530
The real point is being content and finding happiness,
um,

469
00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:11.730
because you can win a hundred times and not find happiness and then even more

470
00:28:11.731 --> 00:28:12.564
depressed.

471
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:15.390
So I just think going through life and going with gut is the best thing.

472
00:28:15.391 --> 00:28:16.320
And when I saw Justin,

473
00:28:16.321 --> 00:28:21.321
my gut went off and I actually saw from start to finish how to take this kid on

474
00:28:21.331 --> 00:28:23.760
youtube.
But when I showed other friends that were like cute kid,

475
00:28:23.761 --> 00:28:24.594
but I don't get it,

476
00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:29.550
I knew exactly how to make him one of the biggest pop stars ever.
Like I,

477
00:28:29.551 --> 00:28:33.990
it just,
it all like flew in and I am a spiritual person.

478
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:38.420
So I think it was someone upstairs that kind of gave me that plan.
Um,

479
00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:42.750
and,
and then I use data,
then I use youtube.

480
00:28:42.751 --> 00:28:44.940
I knew I had to convince people who didn't think the way I thought.

481
00:28:44.941 --> 00:28:45.601
So I was like,
okay,

482
00:28:45.601 --> 00:28:48.420
I'm going to use the data from Yuzu tube and the analytics that youtube is now

483
00:28:48.421 --> 00:28:50.550
sharing with me and you know,

484
00:28:50.551 --> 00:28:54.000
and I'm going to prove it to the naysayers of I'm going to take him some 60,000

485
00:28:54.001 --> 00:28:58.470
views to 66 million here that my nose is itching like crazy.

486
00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:01.170
And in Los Angeles or New York,
when you itch your nose,

487
00:29:01.171 --> 00:29:02.520
people completely get the wrong idea.

488
00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:06.860
<v 3>Yeah.
I just want to say I live a healthy life.
Just,</v>

489
00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:12.250
just have some allergies.
I'm not,
I'm not that entertainment guy.

490
00:29:12.251 --> 00:29:16.530
Just want to itch the dose scooters sober and lucid right now.
Yeah.
Oh,

491
00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:22.390
very honest.
The only way to go through life.
Uh,
wow.

492
00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:23.350
Uh,

493
00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:28.350
Ariana Grande's in my mind is probably the closest thing we've seen to Mariah

494
00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:30.730
Carey since Mariah Carey where I carry,
he's just so,

495
00:29:30.731 --> 00:29:33.310
so def artists back in the day,
um,

496
00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:36.880
talk about how you met her and got her to sign on board and then your journey

497
00:29:36.881 --> 00:29:37.260
with,

498
00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:40.860
<v 2>she was never so SUDEP just clue heat.
Jermaine produced her album.
Oh,</v>

499
00:29:40.861 --> 00:29:42.070
I didn't get produced emancipation

500
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:44.020
<v 3>of Mimi velvet room guy knows too.</v>

501
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:49.030
I wasn't gonna crap to you or when I was like,
now I'm gonna correct.
You know,

502
00:29:49.031 --> 00:29:53.040
way more about this and be a,
okay.
Got It.
Um,
it's been a big mistake.
We're going,

503
00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:57.850
but how did you meet Ariana?
How'd you get her to,

504
00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:00.400
how'd you convince her to sign on board and that and then talk about the
journey.

505
00:30:00.401 --> 00:30:02.290
Cause she,
she left and came back.

506
00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:04.293
<v 2>Um,</v>

507
00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:11.430
I saw Ariana on youtube do a cover of a Justin Bieber song while she was playing

508
00:30:11.651 --> 00:30:13.720
a secondary character on a Nickelodeon show.

509
00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:19.060
And I was blown away by her voice.
Uh,
and I was like,

510
00:30:19.061 --> 00:30:24.061
this girl is a star and I wanted to meet her and I couldn't really get to her.

511
00:30:24.131 --> 00:30:27.160
And then I saw that she wanted to make music.

512
00:30:27.161 --> 00:30:29.080
So I reached out to a buddy and I was like,
look,

513
00:30:29.081 --> 00:30:31.660
I know I might be a jerk because now she's want to make music and I'm ever reach

514
00:30:31.661 --> 00:30:33.310
out before,
but I've wanted to for a long time.

515
00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:37.690
And it turned out that she had been wanting to meet me for a couple of years and

516
00:30:37.691 --> 00:30:40.720
people that she was asking me to set up were kind of blocking it because they

517
00:30:40.721 --> 00:30:45.460
didn't want me in.
They wanted to be in.
And,

518
00:30:45.461 --> 00:30:50.080
uh,
we met and completely hit it off.
And I said,

519
00:30:50.081 --> 00:30:54.760
let's do this and one on this.
Amazing,
uh,
Ronnie,
what shocked me is that,

520
00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:58.000
um,
Nickelodeon had to deal with Sony and I was like,

521
00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:01.150
how are you not signed to Sony?
And it turns out she said,
Hey,

522
00:31:01.151 --> 00:31:03.190
I want to make music.
And they heard her saying,
and they were like,
well,

523
00:31:03.191 --> 00:31:05.320
she's not a star.
We're not going to give a record deal.

524
00:31:05.321 --> 00:31:08.920
And Sony actually passed on Ariana,
um,

525
00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:11.570
their loss,
our game.

526
00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:16.330
And we did the deal and we started working together and we had two number one

527
00:31:16.331 --> 00:31:21.220
elms.
Uh,
and as you can see on the stage,
I don't really hold my tongue.

528
00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:24.640
Um,
and you know,

529
00:31:24.641 --> 00:31:27.940
there were some other people in her life that were,
um,

530
00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:33.030
kind of as you become more and more popular and famous and more success,

531
00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:36.430
people just start showing up and they want to create dissension because they

532
00:31:36.431 --> 00:31:39.700
want to create opportunities for themselves and their people that were creating

533
00:31:39.701 --> 00:31:41.350
dissension between she and I.

534
00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:45.520
And instead of just kind of succumbing to that,
I,

535
00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:48.640
you know,
said what I felt.

536
00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:53.200
And I'm in that confusion.
We went separate ways.

537
00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:54.620
And,
uh,

538
00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:59.450
six months later when those people show their true colors,
um,

539
00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:02.170
she called me up and she said,
can we,
can we meet?

540
00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:07.210
And we met up and we kind of stayed cordial.
Um,
and it was,

541
00:32:07.211 --> 00:32:10.180
it was nothing.
It was a hug,
forgiven,
you know,

542
00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:13.780
forgive each other for anything that was said and back to it.

543
00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:18.260
And then we had incredible success.
And then,
uh,
and,

544
00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:22.120
and then I'm sure your next question is,

545
00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:24.890
we went through some really trying times together.

546
00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:31.790
<v 3>Yeah.
And talk about a switching,
switching actually to,
uh,
to Kanye.
Oh,</v>

547
00:32:31.791 --> 00:32:34.880
I thought you'd go there.
Well actually,
yeah,
I should go there.

548
00:32:34.881 --> 00:32:36.770
That you kind of Stevie off.
Well,
uh,
did it,

549
00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:38.900
can you talk about those trying times story on him?
Look,

550
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:44.050
<v 2>yeah,
glad you asked.
Um,</v>

551
00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:49.680
I didn't see that coming.
Uh,

552
00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:55.160
Ariana very well known had a terrorist attack at a show in Manchester.
Um,

553
00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.570
and over 20 people were killed,

554
00:32:59.571 --> 00:33:03.890
including a nine year old girl and other kids and uh,

555
00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:08.030
and she was there and these people were there to see her.

556
00:33:08.031 --> 00:33:11.430
And there's that guilt you carry when that happens.
Um,

557
00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:15.020
and I was angry because of my grandparents were Holocaust survivors.

558
00:33:15.021 --> 00:33:18.890
I always knew that kind of evil existed in the world.
Um,

559
00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:22.130
and I kind of waited my whole life or an opportunity to take it on.

560
00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:25.940
So I was like rewritten and ready to go and fill with anger.
And I was like,

561
00:33:25.941 --> 00:33:27.350
we're going to do a show,
we're going to go back.

562
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:31.670
And when I got to her the next day,

563
00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:35.000
she rightfully so was torn apart and she was like,

564
00:33:35.001 --> 00:33:39.190
I don't know if I could ever sing these songs again,
let alone go on stage.
Uh,

565
00:33:39.191 --> 00:33:44.191
so I had to kind of pull myself back and realize this wasn't a moment for me.

566
00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:45.973
Um,

567
00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:50.300
and I worked on canceling the tour or worked with our insurance team and they

568
00:33:50.301 --> 00:33:53.840
insurance company was British and they completely understood and actually said,

569
00:33:53.841 --> 00:33:57.680
we're going to pay the full fee for all her shows for the rest of the tour.

570
00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:01.400
We're going to fully cover the insurance and think about that.

571
00:34:01.401 --> 00:34:03.770
So now she's getting her full fee,
but she doesn't have to pay for production,

572
00:34:03.771 --> 00:34:05.570
should pay for the costume shop,
pay for staff.

573
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:09.770
She's actually going to make more money by not performing for the last two

574
00:34:09.771 --> 00:34:14.090
months than she would on the hire tour by just accepting the insurance.

575
00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:17.990
Um,
and by the time I flew home,
two days later,

576
00:34:17.991 --> 00:34:21.020
I got home to 16 text messages saying,
call me,
call me,
call me.

577
00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:25.640
And I called her up and she knew that financial point and she said,
um,

578
00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:28.430
if I don't do something,
I'm not who I say I am.

579
00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:32.000
And all these kids who come and see me and all the things I tell them,

580
00:34:32.001 --> 00:34:36.400
they're not real.
So what's the plan?
And uh,

581
00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:40.220
I said,
look,
I,
she goes,
I'm ready to go on tour tomorrow.
I want to go back.

582
00:34:40.221 --> 00:34:40.731
And I said,
look,

583
00:34:40.731 --> 00:34:42.890
I think you need to take some time to make sure you're strong enough.

584
00:34:42.891 --> 00:34:44.720
Cause I think you're excited right now,

585
00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:48.290
but let's go back in two weeks because that's Paris.

586
00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:53.590
We'll cancel six shows because you need time to heal and really take this in.

587
00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:57.050
And Paris is where the eagles of death metal happened.

588
00:34:57.051 --> 00:34:58.790
And I thought that was a great statement.
And I said,

589
00:34:58.791 --> 00:35:01.790
but I have a crazier idea before Paris.

590
00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:05.060
Instead of waiting three,
four months a year,

591
00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:09.440
we should go back to Manchester and perform.
And she goes,
do you think so why?

592
00:35:09.441 --> 00:35:09.921
And I said,

593
00:35:09.921 --> 00:35:13.520
because the reason terrorist do this is they want to change our way of life.

594
00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:14.600
They want to scare us.

595
00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:19.430
And the best way to stop it from happening again is answering right away and

596
00:35:19.431 --> 00:35:22.070
answering and defiance and letting them know they're not going to change our way

597
00:35:22.071 --> 00:35:26.450
of life.
And she,
without even pausing was like,
I'm in.

598
00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:28.490
And A,
we had two weeks,

599
00:35:28.491 --> 00:35:33.491
we put the show together and I put a tremendous amount of pressure on a small

600
00:35:34.221 --> 00:35:39.180
Italian girl shoulders.
And um,
and she stepped up and she handled it.

601
00:35:39.181 --> 00:35:41.670
And there were a lot of amazing people who stepped up for that show.

602
00:35:41.671 --> 00:35:45.450
And that will always go down in my mind is the most important and most

603
00:35:45.451 --> 00:35:48.570
incredible show I've ever been a part of.
To give you a little context,

604
00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:50.910
we finally got back to the UK.

605
00:35:50.911 --> 00:35:53.070
We were hurting the night before staying in Manchester.

606
00:35:53.071 --> 00:35:58.071
We rehearsed at Wembley arena the night before and that night was the night of

607
00:35:59.071 --> 00:36:00.300
the London Bridge attack.

608
00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:05.790
So the second terrorist attack happened the night before our show.
Wow.
Um,

609
00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:10.710
and that was the first time I was thinking is my excitement and arrogance going

610
00:36:10.711 --> 00:36:14.460
to get people killed.
And before I could even think about canceling the show.

611
00:36:14.461 --> 00:36:17.730
Chris Martin from Coldplay who was in the show sends me a text,

612
00:36:17.731 --> 00:36:21.120
please don't cancel.
And then Marcus Mumford calls me,

613
00:36:21.121 --> 00:36:24.510
cause I had just seen him in rehearsal and it says,
do not cancel.

614
00:36:24.511 --> 00:36:27.420
It's more important ever that you guys do this show.
Arianna,

615
00:36:27.421 --> 00:36:29.790
I never even talked to about do you even go there?

616
00:36:29.791 --> 00:36:34.200
She had already gone to sleep and uh,
I spent the night,
talked to her mom,

617
00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:38.880
we decided to go on with the show and the Greater Manchester Police wanted me to

618
00:36:38.881 --> 00:36:42.810
release a statement on behalf of our team that the show was going to go on.

619
00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.330
I spent the whole night riding it,
woke up,
put it out.

620
00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:49.950
And I said that we have a greater responsibility now more than ever to continue

621
00:36:49.951 --> 00:36:53.970
on this journey.
And you know,
not only for the victims of Manchester,

622
00:36:53.971 --> 00:36:57.960
but the victims of London to honor them and be on that stage.
Um,

623
00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:02.250
and then the Manchester Police put out a statement saying the show will go on,

624
00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:07.230
however,
please understand that the alert is now at high,

625
00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:09.990
which means there's likely going to be an attack.

626
00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:16.020
And we were going to be on youtube.
Thanks.
Uh,
Facebook,

627
00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:19.710
Twitter,
a capital radio,
BBC radio,

628
00:37:19.711 --> 00:37:24.450
and the BBC so you could watch our entire show from your home.

629
00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:29.550
I was convinced no one was going to show up.
And when Marcus walked out,
um,

630
00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:32.520
to open the show,
mom Mumford guys at weren't in town.

631
00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:35.970
It's the only time Marcus Mumford has ever performed without Mumford and sons.

632
00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:40.830
And he did Tim Shell.
And he changed a couple of lyrics to honor the victims.

633
00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:44.220
And when he walked out,
there were 60,000 people in the place.

634
00:37:44.221 --> 00:37:48.180
It was packed and it was chills because it was going about to be a three,

635
00:37:48.181 --> 00:37:52.470
four hour show.
And he and I talked beforehand about what,
how to start it.

636
00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:56.910
And we asked for a moment of silence and at the end he said,
let's not be afraid.

637
00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:58.020
And the place roared.

638
00:37:58.050 --> 00:38:02.100
And it's something I'll never forget for the rest of my life.
That's incredible.

639
00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:04.830
That's awesome that you guys were able to stay the course,

640
00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:06.180
<v 1>make it happen.
Yeah.
Give it up.</v>

641
00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:16.800
<v 3>Okay.
So,
uh,
I want to talk about Kanye.
Uh,
you,</v>

642
00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:19.050
you've had a relationship with Connie for a while,

643
00:38:19.051 --> 00:38:23.880
but you signed them kind of later in his career.
Uh,
can you talk about,
uh,
what,

644
00:38:23.881 --> 00:38:27.600
what Kanye means to you as,
as a,
as a friend and as and as a,
you know,

645
00:38:27.601 --> 00:38:31.890
colleague now,
um,
and yeah.
What the future holds for Kanya

646
00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:33.433
<v 2>look.
Um,</v>

647
00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:40.390
he is the most interesting person I've ever met in my life.
Uh,

648
00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:44.950
he is a genius and I've witnessed and experienced that he truly is a creative

649
00:38:44.951 --> 00:38:47.980
genius cause all my other clients,
you know,

650
00:38:47.981 --> 00:38:51.740
a lot of it kind of comes on the creativity,
the ideas,

651
00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:54.640
like a lot of it myself and team members,

652
00:38:54.641 --> 00:38:57.190
like it's on us to kind of come up with and then work with them.

653
00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:00.130
Connie is always the person.
He's like,
yeah,
I like that,
but what about this?

654
00:39:00.131 --> 00:39:03.340
And you're like,
Damn,
how did I not see that?
Um,

655
00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:07.690
but he's even made me see colors differently.
Like,
I,
I've,
you know,

656
00:39:07.691 --> 00:39:12.691
we've spent so much talking about colors and palettes that I actually see colors

657
00:39:13.001 --> 00:39:17.530
in aesthetic differently because of his education of hours and hours and hours

658
00:39:17.531 --> 00:39:21.010
of conversation.
It doesn't,
he have like Synesthesia,
like,
like yes,

659
00:39:21.011 --> 00:39:25.960
he downs or Cully when he hears sounds,
he sees colors crazy.
Um,

660
00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:29.370
and we were friends for a long time.
Uh,

661
00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:32.110
if you look up the ludicrous standup video,

662
00:39:32.111 --> 00:39:36.940
I am the promoter club owner jumping around,
dancing in it.

663
00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:39.330
And um,
Kanye produced that song.

664
00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:43.020
He makes a cameo in it and we actually met then before he had just signed to the

665
00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:46.600
rock and he was a producer and no one knew who Kanye West was other than,

666
00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:47.860
you know,
if you'd work them as producer.

667
00:39:47.861 --> 00:39:50.560
And we met on that set and we're friendly and kind of over the years,

668
00:39:50.561 --> 00:39:52.570
always knew each other.
His original manager,

669
00:39:52.571 --> 00:39:56.200
John Monopoly was always good to me when I was a younger guy.
Um,

670
00:39:57.130 --> 00:40:00.850
and then when he put up a tweet saying he was $52 million in debt,

671
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:06.220
he's my friend.
So I texted him,
are you okay?
And,
um,

672
00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:08.650
I guess a lot of people didn't ask him if he was okay.

673
00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:14.080
So he called me back just to talk.
And after talking for about an hour,
he said,

674
00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:16.660
you know,
you need to come work with me.
And I said,
Connie,
we've talked.

675
00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:19.780
We talked about this before.
I don't want to do that.

676
00:40:19.781 --> 00:40:23.410
Like I'm afraid of working with you because I don't want to lose the friendship.

677
00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:27.100
I love you dude,
not on it.
You need to come work with me.
You need to manage me,

678
00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:30.670
know I'm gonna call it as you need to manage me.
And I said,
no,
no,
no,
we're,

679
00:40:30.671 --> 00:40:33.820
we're good.
Why don't we,
when are you back?
You're back in a week.
Okay,

680
00:40:33.821 --> 00:40:37.330
you're back in a week.
We'll talk about it then.
And I thought,

681
00:40:37.331 --> 00:40:40.030
this is like the eighth time he and I have had a conversation like that.
Like,

682
00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:41.980
we're going to get it,
we'll stay friends.

683
00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:44.740
The next morning I got a call from Adidas and Def Jam.

684
00:40:44.741 --> 00:40:46.630
So we're told you the manager and to deal with you.

685
00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:50.820
And that is how I became Kanye West furniture.
Um,

686
00:40:51.850 --> 00:40:53.350
but he's become like a brother.

687
00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:57.430
And I joke around that it's been two and a half years now.
And you know,

688
00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:00.760
I think we'll always be friends and we'll always find ways to work together

689
00:41:00.761 --> 00:41:04.930
because we both have this feeling of like art can change the world.

690
00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:10.150
Um,
and I joke around all the time that,
you know,
I'm his manager today,

691
00:41:10.151 --> 00:41:13.780
but I might not be tomorrow.
Like I've lasted longer than most.

692
00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:16.930
Um,
but you know,

693
00:41:16.931 --> 00:41:21.931
I'm going to be with him next week and saw him last week and it's,

694
00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:24.850
he knows it.
He's like,
someday when you're older,

695
00:41:24.851 --> 00:41:27.430
you're going to say you manage Kanye West.
And that's cool.
And I'm like,

696
00:41:27.431 --> 00:41:31.340
it's cool right now,
bro.
I mean,
we walked in,
you were like,
nice,
easy.

697
00:41:31.341 --> 00:41:35.310
So I was like,
you're God damn right.
It's like I got a hookup.
Yeah.

698
00:41:36.370 --> 00:41:38.870
But he,
he really is a genius.

699
00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:41.290
And here's the thing I like to say about it publicly because I don't like to

700
00:41:41.291 --> 00:41:43.940
talk about it too much publicly.
Out of respect for,
that's not really his thing.

701
00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:48.470
Um,
but Kanye west is the best listener of any artist I've ever worked with.

702
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:52.130
That's incredible because I feel like that's probably the biggest public

703
00:41:52.131 --> 00:41:55.970
misperception.
She biggest misperception.
Kanye wants the information,

704
00:41:56.300 --> 00:42:00.830
he wants to learn everything.
If you interrupt him and say,
Hey,
my bad,
he goes,
no,

705
00:42:00.831 --> 00:42:03.290
no.
What did you want to say?
He wants.

706
00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:07.610
He's the best listener of anyone I've ever worked with.
Hands down.

707
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:10.190
And he's also someone who doesn't keep me on the phone and if I say,
Hey,

708
00:42:10.191 --> 00:42:12.200
my kid needs me,
I'll call you right back.
No problem.

709
00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:16.580
Like he's actually incredibly in his own way,

710
00:42:16.581 --> 00:42:20.610
empathetic and considerate,
and is a really,
really,
really good listener.

711
00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:24.080
When he gets frustrated,
his passion might take over and he goes,

712
00:42:24.081 --> 00:42:25.290
what I call full Yay.

713
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:32.230
But he has a heart of gold and he really is an amazing listener.

714
00:42:32.841 --> 00:42:35.780
And that is,
yeah,
I think 100% the base misconception,

715
00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:39.870
<v 3>I'm going to name some people you've worked with and you just give me the first</v>

716
00:42:39.871 --> 00:42:43.410
word that pops into your head.
Okay.
Okay.
Justin Bieber.

717
00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:48.590
<v 2>Why did hair come to the first thing?
I come back.
Not that that's a,</v>

718
00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:53.300
that's family.
Usher also family.
Um,

719
00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:54.163
brother

720
00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:55.420
<v 3>Karlie Kloss</v>

721
00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:01.510
kindness Martin Garrix wild man.

722
00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:04.000
Bloodpop Lauren's

723
00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:07.490
<v 2>also jumping to your pool,
fully clothed.</v>

724
00:43:08.590 --> 00:43:11.510
Um,
blow pop.
Uh,

725
00:43:13.210 --> 00:43:16.750
<v 3>brilliant.
The won the won it.</v>

726
00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:22.720
I'm glad you came.
Uh,
Kanya last one.
Genius.

727
00:43:23.290 --> 00:43:26.500
Love it.
Okay.
Arianna,
I didn't ask Ariana.

728
00:43:26.501 --> 00:43:30.850
Ariana brave.
Awesome.
Um,

729
00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:35.320
and it feels like right now you represent mostly pop.

730
00:43:35.321 --> 00:43:39.730
Would you say you came from a hip hop background?
Uh,
yeah.

731
00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:42.430
W W how do you,
how do you reconcile that?
Do you want to,
you know,

732
00:43:42.490 --> 00:43:43.870
do more hip hop stuff or

733
00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:50.620
<v 2>I am in business with more hip hop people then I let know publicly and I'm also</v>

734
00:43:51.021 --> 00:43:54.290
in business with a lot of country music that I don't talk about publicly are our

735
00:43:54.291 --> 00:43:56.420
company has,
um,

736
00:43:56.570 --> 00:44:00.560
a branch of it that owns a piece of a bunch of other companies within our

737
00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:03.500
business.
So we own 50% of a lot of other companies.

738
00:44:03.501 --> 00:44:07.130
We just don't talk about it publicly and allows me to touch other genres,

739
00:44:07.131 --> 00:44:11.570
be involved with other genres.
Um,
and you know,

740
00:44:11.571 --> 00:44:14.840
we've done Edm,
we've done country.
Um,

741
00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:18.350
but there's people that,
you know,
they'll see me at shows and be like,

742
00:44:18.351 --> 00:44:20.960
I don't know,
you're friends with this person.
And you know,

743
00:44:20.961 --> 00:44:23.420
sometimes I'm in business with them as well.
But,
uh,

744
00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:28.940
it's funny because probably of any manager of music history I probably done,

745
00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:33.240
I've put myself out there probably the most because I thought it was a new world

746
00:44:33.241 --> 00:44:36.000
and you know,
if you can create a brand for yourself,

747
00:44:36.001 --> 00:44:38.730
then you can launch other brands and social media was changing things.

748
00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:41.940
So I made a conscious decision to do that knowing that it would put a target on

749
00:44:41.941 --> 00:44:45.990
my back and it would be something people used to criticize me and kind of judge

750
00:44:45.991 --> 00:44:48.690
my character and assume that,
you know,
people that don't know me,

751
00:44:48.691 --> 00:44:49.471
they might assume,
oh,

752
00:44:49.471 --> 00:44:52.800
he's doing that because he wants to become a public figure or be consumed by

753
00:44:52.801 --> 00:44:55.860
that.
And the truth is the majority of the successes we have,

754
00:44:55.890 --> 00:45:00.630
we'll never speak about.
Um,
and the majority of my public life,

755
00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:02.520
my private life isn't very public.

756
00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:07.560
I choose to like show my family in certain aspects,
um,

757
00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:12.030
publicly only because when I came into the industry,
you know,

758
00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:15.900
fast women fast cars was a stigma that you thought of when you thought of a

759
00:45:15.901 --> 00:45:19.200
successful entertainment,
you know,
man.

760
00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:24.180
And uh,
I wanted to change that paradigm.
I want,

761
00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:27.600
I want people to see me and I want them to know you can have success in this

762
00:45:27.601 --> 00:45:32.220
industry and be a good husband,
a good father,
a good friend of family,
man.

763
00:45:32.221 --> 00:45:33.054
And I also think,

764
00:45:33.090 --> 00:45:37.890
especially with what I'm seeing now with time's up in the me too movement,
that,

765
00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:40.440
you know,
this movement can't just be about women.

766
00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:44.430
This movement needs to be about moving the needle on men in the industry so they

767
00:45:44.431 --> 00:45:45.270
treat women better.

768
00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:49.290
<v 3>And um,
and I think</v>

769
00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:52.800
<v 2>the only way you do that is you,
you move the needle on what a man's goal is.</v>

770
00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:53.641
If you,

771
00:45:53.641 --> 00:45:57.750
if you tell a young man coming in industry that success doesn't look like that,

772
00:45:57.751 --> 00:46:00.150
that's actually not a good result.

773
00:46:00.610 --> 00:46:05.610
Success is being someone who is honorable to women in someone who's honorable to

774
00:46:05.911 --> 00:46:09.180
their family and honor roll to their commitments of family,

775
00:46:09.690 --> 00:46:11.190
then I think you're going to see more young,

776
00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:16.200
young men not acting so on appropriately and becoming like the generation that

777
00:46:16.201 --> 00:46:17.340
we're seeing fall right now.

778
00:46:17.341 --> 00:46:21.780
And that is something I want because I was raised by a strong woman and I

779
00:46:21.781 --> 00:46:24.330
married one.
So you know,
I,
I don't,

780
00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:28.680
I don't want the next dude coming up looking at my success and thinking,
oh,

781
00:46:28.681 --> 00:46:31.890
I want that car and I want,
you know,
that young girl,
like,
no,

782
00:46:31.891 --> 00:46:34.110
that's not what it's about.
That's actually,

783
00:46:34.170 --> 00:46:38.880
that's a very shallow life in my opinion.
Sorry,
I talked about this too long.

784
00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:42.080
<v 3>Well,
you're a good role model.
No,
that's great.
Uh,</v>

785
00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:46.800
you talk about a lot of your success going kind of unspoken and,

786
00:46:46.930 --> 00:46:49.670
and unrecognized or you kind of keeping silent about it.

787
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.920
Fittingly you're the tech arm of SB projects is named silent labs.

788
00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:56.300
Can you talk about,
you know,

789
00:46:56.301 --> 00:47:00.380
we were talking earlier just the history of your involvement with tech to the

790
00:47:00.381 --> 00:47:02.930
extent that you can talk about that.

791
00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:07.430
<v 2>Um,
so the itch came because when I was a big college party promoter,</v>

792
00:47:07.490 --> 00:47:12.050
Emory was one of the first eight schools to launch the Facebook.
And I was like,

793
00:47:12.051 --> 00:47:17.051
what a great way to get my parties out there without having to hack the school

794
00:47:17.301 --> 00:47:19.550
database.
Um,

795
00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:24.640
so I got in touch with the contact page and the master of Dungeon ceremonies,

796
00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:29.710
Mark Zuckerberg or whatever the hell it said at the time.
And he me back,

797
00:47:29.711 --> 00:47:34.420
please talk to it's Wardlow who I saw was the master of coin a or something like

798
00:47:34.421 --> 00:47:37.840
that.
And um,
Eduardo and I for about four months,

799
00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:41.500
negotiated 10% of Facebook for $100,000.

800
00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:46.060
I still have the email,
dear scooter.

801
00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:49.180
Mark wants to launch 32 smaller schools in two weeks.

802
00:47:49.181 --> 00:47:52.420
So unfortunately at this time he refuses to take any outside investment.

803
00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:55.720
Let me know if you're coming to Boston so we can catch up and see if there's

804
00:47:55.721 --> 00:47:56.860
other stuff we can do together.

805
00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:02.460
Now I joke around in my head that I know I'm a closer and if I would've gone to

806
00:48:02.831 --> 00:48:04.420
Boston,
I probably would have closed that deal.

807
00:48:04.450 --> 00:48:07.000
But remember the high school sweetheart I told you about?
Well,

808
00:48:07.001 --> 00:48:10.780
she ripped my heart out and she went to BC.

809
00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:15.640
So the idea of going to Boston and running into her,
it was not happening.

810
00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:17.890
So I was like,
aw man,
screw this Facebook thing.

811
00:48:17.891 --> 00:48:20.920
I'll have to find another way to promote my parties.
And a year later,

812
00:48:20.921 --> 00:48:23.530
it was like Peter Teal invested million dollars for 10% of Facebook.

813
00:48:23.531 --> 00:48:26.720
And I was like,
I could have made $1 million.
Uh,

814
00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:30.520
that's an unprofitable breakup.
And,
but I didn't know what it was going to be,

815
00:48:30.521 --> 00:48:31.390
so I can't claim credit.

816
00:48:31.391 --> 00:48:34.660
But when it continued to becoming this giant conglomerate,

817
00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:37.900
it made me say,
well,
there was something there.

818
00:48:37.901 --> 00:48:40.330
And it actually made me start investing in tech very,

819
00:48:40.331 --> 00:48:44.680
very early before kind of the music industry in La wanted to start going up to

820
00:48:44.681 --> 00:48:45.131
the valley.

821
00:48:45.131 --> 00:48:48.370
I started going up and not really telling anybody because I didn't want anyone

822
00:48:48.371 --> 00:48:50.470
else going up.
Um,

823
00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:55.630
so I was able to get in early in a lot of really amazing companies and they were

824
00:48:55.631 --> 00:48:59.530
personal investments for me.
And then we had our incubator,

825
00:48:59.531 --> 00:49:04.150
if I wanted the company to invest as well.
Um,
but I was able to,

826
00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:04.751
you know,

827
00:49:04.751 --> 00:49:08.740
I went up and I was meeting with another company and they ordered me an Uber and

828
00:49:08.741 --> 00:49:09.790
I'm like,
what the hell is this?
And I'm like,

829
00:49:09.791 --> 00:49:11.860
it's a new thing here in San Francisco.
It's really cool.

830
00:49:12.310 --> 00:49:15.010
And then a friend of mine said,
Hey,
I met this guy,
Travis,

831
00:49:15.011 --> 00:49:19.780
and I have this great picture of Travis in my living room here in la pitching me

832
00:49:19.781 --> 00:49:21.220
about Uber coming to La.

833
00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:25.780
And I was already an investor when it was just in San Francisco,
um,

834
00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:30.880
and you know,
seeing that whole thing.
And,
uh,
then his competitor came up,

835
00:49:31.390 --> 00:49:36.010
which I got into also,
which,
you know,
made him mad at me for a little while.

836
00:49:36.250 --> 00:49:37.870
Um,
but John's number went to my high school.

837
00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:39.640
Shawn Zimmerman was the same age as my brother.

838
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:43.660
He played soccer when my brother and when that thing happened,
um,

839
00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:46.720
at first it was Zimride and I basically passed because I was an Uber Guy.

840
00:49:46.721 --> 00:49:51.190
But later on,
um,
I had some frustrations and I decided,
you know,
John,

841
00:49:51.191 --> 00:49:55.300
okay,
you know,
let's go do this too.
And um,

842
00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:59.410
I was on a 30 under 30 list and billboard when I was 27 there was a 24 year old

843
00:49:59.411 --> 00:50:03.510
kid on the list and I called a billboard,
Bill Ward,
who was the editor and I say,

844
00:50:03.511 --> 00:50:06.160
can I have the name and number of every single person on the list?

845
00:50:06.161 --> 00:50:10.390
Because I feel like my peers are the people that I want to grow with.

846
00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:12.760
Not Somebody I aspire to be like,
we're going to come up together.

847
00:50:12.761 --> 00:50:15.400
Cause whenever you meet someone powerful,
they say,
oh,
of course I know them,

848
00:50:15.401 --> 00:50:17.080
I'll call them.
We've known each other 30 years.

849
00:50:17.650 --> 00:50:20.500
And you realize that the people sitting next to you when you're working your way

850
00:50:20.501 --> 00:50:23.590
up are the people that you actually going to need when you get there.
Um,

851
00:50:23.591 --> 00:50:26.620
so I called everyone in the list and one of them was a young guy from Sweden

852
00:50:26.621 --> 00:50:30.980
with a startup that was Justin the Sweden.
We became friends and um,

853
00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:35.450
he let me invest in his startup called Spotify.
Um,

854
00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:39.020
and you know,
along the way,

855
00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:43.850
different friends got me into different companies and uh,
um,

856
00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:46.910
it worked out.
You make it seem easy,

857
00:50:46.911 --> 00:50:49.910
like you were like accidentally friends with all the that's crazy.
No,

858
00:50:49.911 --> 00:50:54.770
it lives in,
I just think,
uh,
I don't really think I'm that good at this stuff.

859
00:50:55.310 --> 00:51:00.170
I really think I'm really lucky.
Like when I was a kid and I didn't do homework,

860
00:51:00.171 --> 00:51:04.190
that'd be like a freak snow day because I got a lot of friends who work really,

861
00:51:04.191 --> 00:51:06.080
really hard and they just can't catch a break.

862
00:51:06.830 --> 00:51:10.740
And I'm the dude who goes on the Internet in the middle of the night,
fine.

863
00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:15.050
Justin or my friend sends me a funny video of an overweight Asian dude dancing

864
00:51:15.051 --> 00:51:17.060
and I'm like,
Ooh,
it's like the mock rain.
I'll sign that.

865
00:51:17.330 --> 00:51:21.830
And it's gotten them style and like,
you know,
it's,
you know,

866
00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:24.020
the things that are happening may in my career,

867
00:51:24.021 --> 00:51:27.080
it just doesn't really make sense.
So I don't really think it's on me.

868
00:51:27.081 --> 00:51:29.900
I think somebody,
I'm going to get real spiritual on you guys,

869
00:51:29.901 --> 00:51:33.560
but I actually really believe this because when you cry to your dad at 25 and

870
00:51:33.561 --> 00:51:37.970
then you wake up 11 years later next to who I get to wake up with,

871
00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:43.160
with my two kids and my life,
you can't just sit there and be like,

872
00:51:43.161 --> 00:51:45.200
okay,
this is normal.
It's cause it's not.

873
00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:50.240
So I believe that you get blessings to give them to other people or otherwise

874
00:51:50.241 --> 00:51:51.080
you stop getting them.

875
00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:56.750
That's actually my personal belief and I believe as long as we keep doing

876
00:51:56.751 --> 00:51:58.640
philanthropy,
as long as we keep giving back,

877
00:51:58.641 --> 00:52:02.840
as long as we wake up every day and find a way to make sure somebody else gets

878
00:52:02.841 --> 00:52:05.900
an opportunity than somebody upstairs keeps opening the door for more

879
00:52:05.901 --> 00:52:06.734
opportunities.

880
00:52:07.010 --> 00:52:12.010
And that's just my personal belief and either are really shitty people who get

881
00:52:12.981 --> 00:52:17.840
to win along the way.
I'm not interested in,
in like paying attention to them.
I,

882
00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:20.830
we just got to do what we do.
It's beautiful.
Uh,

883
00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:23.570
do you have time for a couple of questions from the,

884
00:52:23.571 --> 00:52:26.210
I got time for whatever this is.
We didn't know how,
what,

885
00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:28.490
how long is this going to be and where's originally we planned this,

886
00:52:28.491 --> 00:52:31.250
we didn't know we'd be in our new office in Santa Monica so we thought coming

887
00:52:31.251 --> 00:52:35.390
out here was going to take hours so I don't really have anything to do for

888
00:52:35.391 --> 00:52:37.730
another hour.
So uh,

889
00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:41.570
and Zach has my phone so I have no idea how many clients have called.
Well,

890
00:52:41.571 --> 00:52:44.330
I'm up here and I'm actually really enjoying the fact that I don't have a phone.

891
00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:49.430
This is like when I went to burning man,
Google burning man,

892
00:52:49.950 --> 00:52:52.530
do you have anything?
But this is nothing like when I went to burning man,

893
00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:57.790
they do,
they do say burning man is the new Davos though.

894
00:52:57.830 --> 00:53:00.860
Like it's all just tech exec.
So I liked it.
I rode a bike around,

895
00:53:00.861 --> 00:53:01.790
I don't do drugs.

896
00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:04.970
And for those people have this stigma that you do drugs of burning man.
Not True.

897
00:53:05.330 --> 00:53:09.830
I don't do drugs and,
but I do ride bikes and I rode a bike around that desert.

898
00:53:09.831 --> 00:53:13.490
Like I was 15 years old at Babel street park.
My phone wasn't on,

899
00:53:13.491 --> 00:53:14.690
I was a wild man.

900
00:53:14.691 --> 00:53:18.020
I was running that thing straight into the oblivion and it was awesome.

901
00:53:18.021 --> 00:53:21.290
So if you like bike riding,
I will tell you there's a great trail.

902
00:53:21.291 --> 00:53:26.010
It's called burning man.
Okay.
I'm going to give,
I'm

903
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:29.760
<v 3>going to pass this mic around for audience Q and.
A.
Um,
before I do,</v>

904
00:53:29.761 --> 00:53:33.030
do you have anything you want to like plug or promote that SB has going on?

905
00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:35.880
I'm good.
You guys are Google.
You don't need anything from me.

906
00:53:35.881 --> 00:53:37.590
You got a tea tea shop in your office.

907
00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:45.990
That's part of the fun and feel free to pass it to them.
Yeah,
it's pretty cool.

908
00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:50.570
<v 5>Diana scar.
Thanks for being here today.
You are an amazing storyteller.</v>

909
00:53:50.730 --> 00:53:52.860
Learn so much.
Just from listening to you,

910
00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:57.920
you've talked a lot about using technology like social media to discover new

911
00:53:58.561 --> 00:54:02.880
music and new artists.
Thoughts on super new technology that could be,

912
00:54:03.210 --> 00:54:06.570
that could potentially be used to discover new music like robots,

913
00:54:06.571 --> 00:54:10.830
self driving cars,
drones and it gives some context.
I work at Google X,
I'm just

914
00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:15.460
<v 3>blockchain.
Okay.
Watch.
And um,</v>

915
00:54:19.050 --> 00:54:22.860
<v 2>technology is actually always shaped how we see the music industry.</v>

916
00:54:23.250 --> 00:54:28.230
So like before Tesla,
um,
really created what we know is radio today,

917
00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:31.320
there was no music industry because there wasn't a way to distribute.

918
00:54:31.321 --> 00:54:33.960
So technology actually was the creation of the music industry.

919
00:54:33.961 --> 00:54:37.320
And then if you look at,
um,
you know,

920
00:54:37.321 --> 00:54:42.321
whether it be vinyl and then the adaption to eight track and then cds and

921
00:54:43.170 --> 00:54:44.790
cassettes and all these different things,

922
00:54:44.791 --> 00:54:49.791
and then going to MP three and now streaming technology has always built,

923
00:54:49.861 --> 00:54:54.570
lifted and save the music industry.
Uh,
I have no idea what it's going to be next.

924
00:54:54.690 --> 00:54:58.800
I know that I think we're actually in the infant stage of streaming because if

925
00:54:58.801 --> 00:55:00.630
you actually look at it and we're like,
oh my God,

926
00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:04.710
this person sold 5 million albums,
that's mind blowing.

927
00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:07.920
But the amount of people on the planet that listening to music that actually

928
00:55:07.921 --> 00:55:08.580
isn't mindblowing,

929
00:55:08.580 --> 00:55:13.560
we've never created a way where when there's such a great separation of wealth

930
00:55:13.561 --> 00:55:16.950
in this world to be able to distribute music properly amongst all people.

931
00:55:16.950 --> 00:55:19.740
And now we have streaming,
which is changing that.
Um,

932
00:55:20.730 --> 00:55:24.480
so I don't really know necessarily what's next.
I know.

933
00:55:24.481 --> 00:55:28.320
I think we're in round one.
I mean it's,
I think it's eight point $6 billion.

934
00:55:28.321 --> 00:55:29.910
It's streaming's not creating for the industry,

935
00:55:30.270 --> 00:55:33.740
which has brought it back up to where it was and a little bit above.
Um,

936
00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:37.410
I think we're in literally the first inning of a nine inning game of streaming.

937
00:55:37.950 --> 00:55:38.551
I think it's,

938
00:55:38.551 --> 00:55:42.750
it's going to take the value of music up in a way we haven't seen before.
Um,

939
00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:44.910
and then I think as far as AI

940
00:55:46.570 --> 00:55:49.890
is the most interesting part for me because that's how we're getting a lot of

941
00:55:49.891 --> 00:55:52.500
this playlisting and everything else is becoming so influential.

942
00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:57.090
But I still think it's missing the human touch.

943
00:55:57.490 --> 00:55:58.200
Um,

944
00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:02.880
because AI can kind of identify what songs go together or how we put stuff

945
00:56:02.881 --> 00:56:03.714
together.

946
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:08.750
But the human touch can identify a human's interaction with music in a timeline

947
00:56:10.291 --> 00:56:14.190
of life.
Because if I say to you,
um,

948
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:17.970
tell me what you were doing when you were 11 years old,

949
00:56:18.510 --> 00:56:19.780
you're probably not going to your,

950
00:56:19.810 --> 00:56:21.720
maybe there's something influential happening I live on,

951
00:56:21.721 --> 00:56:23.470
but a lot of people who are going to be like,
I'm not really sure,

952
00:56:23.650 --> 00:56:25.990
but if I play you a really big song from that year,

953
00:56:25.991 --> 00:56:28.450
it's going to take you right back to when you were 11 years old.

954
00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:33.840
And there there's something special that AI can't do about identifying that.

955
00:56:34.270 --> 00:56:39.070
Um,
but also there's so many people we're going to need Ai.
Um,

956
00:56:39.580 --> 00:56:40.361
so I'm,

957
00:56:40.361 --> 00:56:43.810
I'm interested to see what someone like yourself comes up with the next and

958
00:56:43.811 --> 00:56:47.260
hopefully by the time you do,
I will be out of the music industry.

959
00:56:47.290 --> 00:56:50.170
And I'm kidding.
Thank you.

960
00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:53.673
Good though.

961
00:56:54.310 --> 00:56:55.960
<v 4>So a scooter,
uh,</v>

962
00:56:55.961 --> 00:56:59.710
what are your thoughts on blockchain technology?

963
00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:03.733
<v 2>Um,</v>

964
00:57:04.730 --> 00:57:08.060
my thoughts are blocked and blockchain technology is amazing and it's going to

965
00:57:08.061 --> 00:57:11.720
be innovative in a hundred different industries,
uh,

966
00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:15.950
but coins aren't needed in every single industry.
Um,

967
00:57:16.010 --> 00:57:21.010
so I think having a coin associated to every piece of blockchain technology is

968
00:57:21.710 --> 00:57:24.830
something that why 99% of the coins will disappear.

969
00:57:24.831 --> 00:57:28.250
And the ones that make sense for the technology that they're associated with and

970
00:57:28.251 --> 00:57:31.280
makes sense for the industry that they're going into will survive.

971
00:57:31.281 --> 00:57:35.060
And those coins will be the Amazon of this bubble.
Um,

972
00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:40.300
but I think that there's a very big difference between blockchain technology and

973
00:57:40.401 --> 00:57:43.820
cryptocurrency,
in my opinion.
And,
uh,

974
00:57:43.850 --> 00:57:48.500
I think that the actual use of blockchain,
blockchain technology,
it,
listen,

975
00:57:48.501 --> 00:57:50.110
if they can break blockchain technology,

976
00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:53.180
we're all screwed because that means that people can break our entire financial

977
00:57:53.181 --> 00:57:54.800
system.
Um,

978
00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:58.910
but I think it's going to make all of our systems more efficient.

979
00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:00.230
Uh,

980
00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:03.790
but I think that people should start educating himself on the difference between

981
00:58:03.810 --> 00:58:06.510
Crypto and what blockchain is and,

982
00:58:07.050 --> 00:58:10.730
and actually understand that it's way too easy to make coins and that's why most

983
00:58:10.731 --> 00:58:13.100
of them should disappear.
But until then,

984
00:58:13.460 --> 00:58:14.960
I'm going to have as much fun as you are.

985
00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:18.830
<v 1>Okay.</v>

986
00:58:18.830 --> 00:58:20.980
<v 2>Off Road,
right in front of you.
Oh,
right there,</v>

987
00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:24.280
<v 4>curator.
This has been awesome.
Thanks for common.
Um,</v>

988
00:58:24.310 --> 00:58:28.990
you're a tremendously successful entrepreneur across a range of industries,
tech,

989
00:58:28.991 --> 00:58:33.640
nonprofits,
music,
media.
What excites you the most in your business?

990
00:58:35.290 --> 00:58:36.123
<v 2>Wow,</v>

991
00:58:38.550 --> 00:58:42.750
I'm really cheesy now that I'm a dad.
Um,
bedtime.

992
00:58:44.610 --> 00:58:46.490
I mean honestly like,
uh

993
00:58:46.830 --> 00:58:47.663
<v 1>Huh.</v>

994
00:58:49.110 --> 00:58:52.110
<v 2>I get excited by challenges and I get inside of by insults.</v>

995
00:58:52.770 --> 00:58:55.620
So when everyone is like,
oh,
you don't,

996
00:58:55.621 --> 00:58:58.920
you don't so well I get really bored cause I don't know where to go.

997
00:58:59.190 --> 00:59:02.570
Insults of usually lead me where to go because doing,
um,

998
00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:05.970
the unreasonable thing has always led to the great thing.

999
00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:08.820
Doing what everyone expects the status quo,
the reasonable,

1000
00:59:08.821 --> 00:59:12.070
it doesn't lead to any kind of greatest,
doesn't lead to a good story.
And I,

1001
00:59:12.210 --> 00:59:14.060
and I always said I wanted to,
you know,

1002
00:59:14.070 --> 00:59:17.370
be my own story instead of reading everyone else's.
Um,

1003
00:59:18.390 --> 00:59:23.120
but what gets me excited at this point?
Who hears a parent?

1004
00:59:24.590 --> 00:59:28.970
Okay.
So the people raise their hand are going to get this.
My Kid,

1005
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:33.350
my three year old woke me up this morning,
slapped me in my forehead and said,

1006
00:59:33.351 --> 00:59:38.030
Daddy,
I love you
so much better than a grammy.

1007
00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:42.530
So much better than you know.
And I and IPO of,
you know,
it's,

1008
00:59:43.010 --> 00:59:46.460
there's no real describing it because you do all this stuff and you don't really

1009
00:59:46.461 --> 00:59:47.930
understand.
You're like,
what am I here for?

1010
00:59:48.110 --> 00:59:52.520
And then you have kids and then you understand who you actually are here for.
Um,

1011
00:59:52.550 --> 00:59:55.460
you have like a purpose when you have children that you just didn't have before

1012
00:59:55.730 --> 00:59:59.270
and there's no good time to have kids cause you're always planning your life and

1013
00:59:59.271 --> 01:00:01.910
seeing it through your own eyes.
And then when they finally show up,
you're like,

1014
01:00:01.911 --> 01:00:04.940
I don't really understand what life would have been without you.
Um,
yeah,
I know.

1015
01:00:04.941 --> 01:00:08.960
I sucked.
You guys are leaving.
You guys want to leave?
Yeah,
I know.

1016
01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:12.260
I saw Dave Chappelle do this one time at a con,
like the comedy store.

1017
01:00:12.290 --> 01:00:14.390
He did like a secret show.
People walked out and he did this.

1018
01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:19.050
Everyone give a round of applause cause they hate me.
Um,

1019
01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:25.300
uh,
I liked about what makes me excited is um,

1020
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.770
either the first time I do something,

1021
01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:30.020
being with my family experienced something like that.

1022
01:00:30.021 --> 01:00:35.021
Or when someone I work with has a first you like if the first time I saw this

1023
01:00:35.091 --> 01:00:36.350
Guy Mike George who works for me,

1024
01:00:36.351 --> 01:00:38.900
receive as first platinum plaque in our company.

1025
01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:42.170
I had at that point in my career,
received a lot of platinum plaques.

1026
01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:43.580
They're in the garage.

1027
01:00:45.110 --> 01:00:49.880
Seeing him have the joy of that first time reminded me of what that felt like

1028
01:00:49.881 --> 01:00:52.310
and that gives me joy.
So I'm,

1029
01:00:52.490 --> 01:00:57.380
I'm kind of at a point now where I feel like my life is kind of absurd and I

1030
01:00:57.381 --> 01:00:59.510
have everything I've ever needed in a lot more.

1031
01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:02.870
And I only got there because I stood on the shoulders of all these people that

1032
01:01:02.871 --> 01:01:03.620
believed in me.

1033
01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:06.860
So now it's my turn to kind of work for them and make sure I pull them up to

1034
01:01:06.861 --> 01:01:09.200
where I'm at.
Awesome.
Thanks.

1035
01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:12.011
<v 6>Uh,</v>

1036
01:01:12.011 --> 01:01:17.011
so what was your response when Kanye was showed a kind of support for Donald

1037
01:01:18.130 --> 01:01:18.963
Trump?

1038
01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:22.820
<v 2>I disagreed.
I mean a,
it's,</v>

1039
01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:27.120
here's the thing,
living in Los Angeles,

1040
01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:30.510
I'm really grateful that I lived in Atlanta,
Georgia until six years ago.

1041
01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:35.550
I'm living in Los Angeles in New York.
Art is amazing.
At living in the states.

1042
01:01:35.551 --> 01:01:39.780
Amazing.
Cause it's probably the most forward state in the nation.
Um,

1043
01:01:39.810 --> 01:01:41.310
but we're not without fault.

1044
01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:44.220
There's the largest separation of wealth in the country is in the state.

1045
01:01:44.790 --> 01:01:49.650
And people acted like they lost their damn minds when he won.

1046
01:01:49.651 --> 01:01:53.730
And to me when he won,
I didn't freak out because that's the process.

1047
01:01:53.731 --> 01:01:56.100
Someone needs to win and then you're supposed to heal and come together.

1048
01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:59.520
A lot of things that he's done since have disappointed me to a place that I'm

1049
01:01:59.521 --> 01:02:03.990
not okay,
but I was going to give him a chance in the beginning.
Um,

1050
01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:05.820
cause I think that's the process.
And if you don't,

1051
01:02:05.821 --> 01:02:08.910
then you're a hypocrite if you're,
you know,
because if,

1052
01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:11.760
if Hillary would have won and they said,
oh,
we don't want to support her,

1053
01:02:11.761 --> 01:02:16.620
we would have been yelling at them.
Um,
so when he felt that way,
I said,
look,

1054
01:02:16.621 --> 01:02:20.820
that's your opinion.
But I also felt like he was that way when at a point where,

1055
01:02:21.330 --> 01:02:23.940
you know,
he was sick,
you know,

1056
01:02:23.941 --> 01:02:27.210
and I felt like there were old people around him.
It was very frustrating.

1057
01:02:27.211 --> 01:02:30.870
I thought we were taking advantage of a time where like if you saw Quincy Jones

1058
01:02:30.871 --> 01:02:31.770
most recent interview,

1059
01:02:31.830 --> 01:02:33.780
nobody should have let that person at the house at the time.

1060
01:02:33.781 --> 01:02:37.350
Like sometimes people need to be given privacy just because they're public

1061
01:02:37.351 --> 01:02:41.610
figures.
They need to be given a moment to process.
Um,
but,

1062
01:02:41.611 --> 01:02:42.444
uh,

1063
01:02:43.170 --> 01:02:47.220
I know his heart and I know that he's a human being then I don't always agree

1064
01:02:47.221 --> 01:02:47.940
with,

1065
01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:52.170
but I respect him and he said what he wanted to say and I'm allowed to have my

1066
01:02:52.171 --> 01:02:54.390
own opinion,
you know,
just cause I managed,

1067
01:02:54.391 --> 01:02:56.340
someone doesn't need me and I need to agree with them.

1068
01:02:56.340 --> 01:03:01.140
Me and Vic Mensa who I manage had a big disagreement recently and I was proud

1069
01:03:01.141 --> 01:03:02.670
that he put up on his Instagram.
He said,

1070
01:03:02.671 --> 01:03:06.090
I know scooter Braun vehemently disagreed with me and he's my manager,

1071
01:03:06.091 --> 01:03:08.850
but I appreciate him at least having a conversation.

1072
01:03:08.851 --> 01:03:12.480
I think we've messed up in this country and really around the world.

1073
01:03:12.481 --> 01:03:15.600
We've forgotten how to speak to each other and we're forgetting the same people

1074
01:03:15.601 --> 01:03:17.970
were yelling at other people.
We're claiming that we're supposed to help.

1075
01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:21.450
And I think we need to start having conversations out of respect again.

1076
01:03:21.451 --> 01:03:23.580
Otherwise nothing is going to change.

1077
01:03:24.890 --> 01:03:25.723
<v 1>Cool.</v>

1078
01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:28.950
<v 2>You got to throw it all the way over there if the throw it.</v>

1079
01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:34.410
Oh good catch.
I thought she was going to you.
She went deep.

1080
01:03:36.070 --> 01:03:37.520
You got to Kirk cousins arm.

1081
01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:39.651
<v 5>So first of all,</v>

1082
01:03:39.651 --> 01:03:44.210
I was a college student in Atlanta from 2002 to 2006 so I probably went to some

1083
01:03:44.211 --> 01:03:48.980
of your parties and didn't even note it.
Um,
but you mentioned about how you,

1084
01:03:48.981 --> 01:03:51.500
when you have success you get bored and you're kind of always looking for that

1085
01:03:51.501 --> 01:03:52.131
next challenge.

1086
01:03:52.131 --> 01:03:55.820
So is there something on the horizon for you that you feel like is some sort of

1087
01:03:55.821 --> 01:04:00.400
like moonshot thing that you'll think you'll go after next or is it just going

1088
01:04:00.401 --> 01:04:04.120
to be bringing up those people behind you and all of those things that are,

1089
01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:07.210
<v 2>I think it's a combination.
If I want to bring them up then I got to keep going.</v>

1090
01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:09.700
Um,
so

1091
01:04:11.950 --> 01:04:15.890
if the way I look at it,
here's the challenge,
I'm 36 years old.
He's like,

1092
01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:18.860
you got a cool story.
If this is the end of my story,

1093
01:04:18.861 --> 01:04:23.390
then I failed because I'm 36 the average entrepreneur hits their stride at 39.

1094
01:04:24.530 --> 01:04:27.590
So to me,
I'm just getting started.

1095
01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:30.800
So I don't know necessarily what it is next.

1096
01:04:30.801 --> 01:04:32.950
And I don't like talking about stuff before it happens.

1097
01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:34.070
So there's things working on.

1098
01:04:34.610 --> 01:04:37.220
But I also know part of my story is going to include failure.

1099
01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:41.210
Cause the last decade of my life has had so much success that statistically if

1100
01:04:41.211 --> 01:04:44.330
I'm really not being a moron in paying attention to a little data,

1101
01:04:45.410 --> 01:04:49.640
statistically I should have some serious failure on the horizon.
You know,

1102
01:04:49.641 --> 01:04:52.940
the Wall Street goes up,
it goes down.
There's always gotta be a correction.

1103
01:04:52.941 --> 01:04:57.230
So what I'm excited about is regardless of what that correction is,

1104
01:04:57.231 --> 01:05:01.610
it's not going to stop me.
It's just going to be a pitstop.
Um,
because now

1105
01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:06.190
we're the universe messed up is they gave me too much.

1106
01:05:06.790 --> 01:05:08.920
Now I've got my wife and kids,
I'm playing with house money.

1107
01:05:09.970 --> 01:05:12.430
So like you can't really take anything away from me.
Like,

1108
01:05:12.431 --> 01:05:16.050
if I lose some money or like lose some,
you know,
popular,
you know,
if,

1109
01:05:16.051 --> 01:05:19.380
if I dropped the ball,
some naysayers who wanted to see me fail for a while,
like,

1110
01:05:19.381 --> 01:05:20.260
ha ha,
I told you so,

1111
01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:24.460
they're going to be super disappointed when they find out I'm not that upset.
Um,

1112
01:05:24.490 --> 01:05:28.090
but I'm just going to keep going and see where it takes me and you know,

1113
01:05:28.270 --> 01:05:32.110
whatever comes next.
I'm ready for it.
And I,
and I,
I get bored,
but I also like,

1114
01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:36.390
I'm a workaholic.
I can't really shut it off.
Like the,

1115
01:05:36.391 --> 01:05:38.560
the hardest challenge for me is work life balance.

1116
01:05:38.561 --> 01:05:43.210
Like I'm constantly getting better,
but my wife,
she was the one who said to me,

1117
01:05:43.211 --> 01:05:43.631
she goes,
you know,

1118
01:05:43.631 --> 01:05:48.070
there's a difference between being present and being present and,
um,

1119
01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:50.170
that's the thing I'm working on the most at home,

1120
01:05:50.830 --> 01:05:55.780
putting the phone down and being present.
Good luck.
Thanks.

1121
01:05:56.410 --> 01:05:58.120
I hope you enjoy the party back in the day.

1122
01:06:00.210 --> 01:06:03.300
<v 7>Thanks.
This has been awesome.
Uh,
I'm curious,</v>

1123
01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:08.160
do you think you could have been as successful had you pursued a completely

1124
01:06:08.161 --> 01:06:09.120
different path?
Like,

1125
01:06:09.121 --> 01:06:11.860
how much of your success is attributable to your passion for,

1126
01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:16.170
for music and your craft as opposed to just your inherent drive?

1127
01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:20.970
<v 2>I mean,
I don't know.
I know that I didn't go into life being like,
you know what?</v>

1128
01:06:20.971 --> 01:06:23.250
I want to do music.
Um,

1129
01:06:23.310 --> 01:06:26.340
I just wanted to be an entrepreneur and that's the way I've always kind of

1130
01:06:26.341 --> 01:06:27.210
consider myself.

1131
01:06:27.211 --> 01:06:30.540
And I read a book about David Geffen where he said music was the fastest way in

1132
01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:34.890
because music takes a night and movies and TV and entertainment take years,

1133
01:06:34.891 --> 01:06:37.890
but at one song to change your life in a night.
And I was like,
ah,
I'm in Atlanta,

1134
01:06:37.891 --> 01:06:42.090
let's go.
Um,
but I,
uh,

1135
01:06:43.230 --> 01:06:44.700
I don't know what my life would have been.

1136
01:06:44.701 --> 01:06:46.320
I think there's so many points in my life.

1137
01:06:46.321 --> 01:06:48.810
I look back and think if I were to turn that way instead of that way,

1138
01:06:48.811 --> 01:06:51.750
what would have happened if I would've stayed in that relationship?

1139
01:06:51.751 --> 01:06:53.330
What would have happened?
Like,
you know,

1140
01:06:53.370 --> 01:06:54.900
there's so many different ways I look at it.

1141
01:06:54.930 --> 01:06:58.740
All I know is I thank God every day I wake up and this is where I ended up

1142
01:06:59.370 --> 01:07:02.910
because I'm 36 years old and whenever I get depressed,

1143
01:07:02.911 --> 01:07:04.500
the one thing I remind myself of this and I'm like,

1144
01:07:04.530 --> 01:07:07.560
if you put my life against any 36 year old on the planet,

1145
01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:11.010
I'm going to take my life.
Like I'm gonna choose this.

1146
01:07:11.011 --> 01:07:14.730
Like this is good stuff for 36 I'm working with this.

1147
01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:17.760
This is fine by me except for the jets.
We never,
when

1148
01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:23.190
I see you with the Steelers shirt,
sorry,

1149
01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:29.020
<v 8>this is great.
And actually listened to you on Simmons as well.</v>

1150
01:07:29.021 --> 01:07:32.970
So I'm one of your three basketball fans.
Nice.
Yeah.
That was fun with bill.

1151
01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:36.580
It was,
he's got to show up at my pickup game now.
Yeah.
And there's nice,

1152
01:07:36.610 --> 01:07:40.420
not too much overlap today.
I'm curious,
you said that you,

1153
01:07:40.421 --> 01:07:43.570
Facebook is kind of like the one that got away on the tech side.

1154
01:07:43.690 --> 01:07:46.690
Curious if there's something on the artist side.
Oh,

1155
01:07:46.691 --> 01:07:49.490
I saw this person that needs to come with me.
I got it.

1156
01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:52.410
<v 2>Um,
I mean there's a bunch of different ones,
but I'm really,
it's like Facebook.</v>

1157
01:07:52.411 --> 01:07:55.710
I don't have real regret.
I feel like it just lead me one way to another.
I mean,

1158
01:07:55.711 --> 01:07:58.740
a funny story is I knew Macklemore before he blew up.

1159
01:07:59.370 --> 01:08:02.730
We were friends and I knew about them in Seattle and um,

1160
01:08:03.030 --> 01:08:05.610
he had the mixed tape and it was just all the hits,
but it wasn't out yet.

1161
01:08:05.910 --> 01:08:08.670
And he sent it to me.
We were talking and I was just like,

1162
01:08:09.090 --> 01:08:13.080
is there any way I get you to sign,
you know,
over here?
And he said,
look,

1163
01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:17.690
the only person I would sign with his drink.
So I hit up Drake and I'm like,

1164
01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:20.660
you should do this.
And he's like,
okay,
hit.
And it tells me one of his guys,

1165
01:08:20.690 --> 01:08:23.960
you know,
to hit we trust on the HR side.
And um,

1166
01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:27.710
Drake and I weren't in business the way we are now.
Um,

1167
01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:32.360
but we were friends and his guy just didn't pay attention to past and went

1168
01:08:32.361 --> 01:08:35.360
Macklemore's album went number one.
They were like,
don't tell drink.

1169
01:08:37.190 --> 01:08:41.210
Um,
but it,
you know,
like I said,

1170
01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:43.610
I wake up and I looked at my life like I don't want to look back and have

1171
01:08:43.611 --> 01:08:44.444
regrets.

1172
01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:47.030
I think the only thing you should ever regret about is things that you do that

1173
01:08:47.031 --> 01:08:50.810
were malicious,
like missing out on stuff or anything like that.

1174
01:08:50.811 --> 01:08:53.810
Like I don't have regrets,
like that's part of the journey.

1175
01:08:54.350 --> 01:08:57.920
But if you do something malicious,
I'll tell you something I have regret about,

1176
01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:02.600
I was a basketball camp when I was in seventh grade or eighth grade,

1177
01:09:02.601 --> 01:09:05.960
like sleep away camp.
And these older kids a year older than me,

1178
01:09:05.961 --> 01:09:09.200
they were real cool.
They were like,
come hang with us cause I was,
I was good.

1179
01:09:09.710 --> 01:09:13.850
And they were like,
man,
this kid in our hall,
he's Dork user and I'm like,

1180
01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.820
don't work.
I'm a Dork,
but okay.
Um,

1181
01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:19.630
and they like broke into his room while he wasn't there and they put all his

1182
01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:24.260
shorts in the ground.
They're like,
Scooter pee on it.
And I knew it was wrong,

1183
01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:25.340
but these older kids were like,

1184
01:09:25.341 --> 01:09:30.080
peer pressure me and I peed on this poor kid's clothes.
And,

1185
01:09:30.081 --> 01:09:34.320
um,
we can't gets reported kids having to have to wear,
you know,

1186
01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:37.030
his bathing suit to play in,
you know,
stuff cause there's p and,

1187
01:09:37.550 --> 01:09:41.750
and I just felt so bad,
I was like screw these kids.

1188
01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:45.170
So I went up to him and I said,
I did this to you.
I'm so sorry.

1189
01:09:45.171 --> 01:09:47.210
Screw these kids are reported myself.

1190
01:09:47.211 --> 01:09:49.760
They didn't let me play in the All Star game even though I had made the all star

1191
01:09:49.761 --> 01:09:53.690
team at the end of the week.
And to this day,

1192
01:09:53.691 --> 01:09:57.740
even though I made it right,
kind of,
I never forgot that because I was like,

1193
01:09:57.741 --> 01:10:00.650
that's regret.
I knew better.
Like I shouldn't have done that.

1194
01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:04.670
But everything else in my life,
if I missed out,
I missed out.
I wasn't,

1195
01:10:04.950 --> 01:10:09.500
I didn't do anything bad.
Shouldn't peed on his clothes man

1196
01:10:11.530 --> 01:10:14.930
for seventh grade or does that also his mom?

1197
01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:18.950
He didn't tell his mom that we made good.
So I didn't tell my dad would happen.

1198
01:10:18.951 --> 01:10:21.500
He didn't understand why I was in the All Star game and the last day of camp,

1199
01:10:21.501 --> 01:10:24.450
the parents come and the mom,
I'm sitting there and she goes like,

1200
01:10:24.451 --> 01:10:27.950
you disgusting little kid.
How dare you be at my son's clothes?
And I'm like,
what?

1201
01:10:27.951 --> 01:10:30.110
And he's like,
no,
mom,
we're good now.
We're good.
And my dad's like,

1202
01:10:30.111 --> 01:10:34.730
what are you doing?
And I was like,
I don't,
I don't know dad.

1203
01:10:35.810 --> 01:10:38.120
And then,
and then he goes,
how dare you say my son?
And she goes,

1204
01:10:38.121 --> 01:10:40.730
he PDLs he did not tell him and all this.
He looks at me and I'm like,

1205
01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:45.770
and he goes,
oh,
you're dead.
And uh,
I just,

1206
01:10:45.771 --> 01:10:48.110
that was not a good interaction with my dad at that time.

1207
01:10:49.340 --> 01:10:50.900
Coach Brown was not happy with me.

1208
01:10:53.470 --> 01:10:55.600
<v 9>A scooter.
A question.
Uh,</v>

1209
01:10:55.601 --> 01:10:59.620
what our conversations at the dinner table like with your family?
Uh,

1210
01:10:59.830 --> 01:11:04.630
the manuals tend to have very,
uh,
they bring their work to the table.

1211
01:11:04.990 --> 01:11:06.880
Uh,
I'm wondering,
um,

1212
01:11:06.910 --> 01:11:09.550
and their narrative reminds me a lot of your families as well.

1213
01:11:09.820 --> 01:11:14.190
So as curious if your family has a similar question,
do you want to know

1214
01:11:14.230 --> 01:11:17.460
<v 2>like what it was like growing up or what is like next to the growing up?</v>

1215
01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:20.370
Growing up?
Um,
it was very important.

1216
01:11:20.371 --> 01:11:22.890
My parents that we sat down at the table and had,
you know,

1217
01:11:22.891 --> 01:11:26.640
a family meal and my parents were nine to five because my dad was a coach and

1218
01:11:26.641 --> 01:11:30.160
then he was a dentist and my mom was an orthodontist.
So,
you know,

1219
01:11:30.270 --> 01:11:32.820
they can be home every single night kind of when work was done.

1220
01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:35.520
And it was always important for us to sit around the table and have a

1221
01:11:35.521 --> 01:11:38.280
conversation.
And me and my brother,
um,

1222
01:11:38.310 --> 01:11:41.130
were very competitive and like we'd get into fights because we only two years

1223
01:11:41.131 --> 01:11:44.700
apart.
But if we fought too much then dad got involved.

1224
01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:48.120
He was bigger and stronger and fights better.
Um,

1225
01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:51.900
but it was very much challenges,
you know,

1226
01:11:51.901 --> 01:11:55.440
extremely competitive challenges.
Me and my dad were definitely the loudest.

1227
01:11:55.740 --> 01:11:57.150
My mom,
when she spoke,

1228
01:11:57.151 --> 01:12:01.090
everyone shut up and listen cause she was like the quiet boss.
Like,

1229
01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:04.380
my dad would talk a lot,
but if my mom spoke,
it was like,
okay,

1230
01:12:04.381 --> 01:12:08.850
that's we're done now.
Um,
but it was always,

1231
01:12:08.851 --> 01:12:11.340
what did you do today?
Very competitive,

1232
01:12:11.610 --> 01:12:15.600
kind of pushing each other but also a tremendous amount of love.
Like it wasn't,

1233
01:12:16.110 --> 01:12:18.900
you know,
there was,
there was high praise.

1234
01:12:18.901 --> 01:12:22.710
We were appreciated for our achievements and we were always told every night

1235
01:12:22.711 --> 01:12:23.410
before we went to bed,

1236
01:12:23.410 --> 01:12:25.980
my dad used to come on a room as long as I can remember and say,
hey,

1237
01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:29.700
bronze are different.
And we were like,
what does that mean?
And he always say,

1238
01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:31.740
it doesn't mean you're better than anybody,
but you're different.

1239
01:12:31.741 --> 01:12:34.440
And I hold you to extraordinary standards cause I think you're extraordinary.

1240
01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:37.650
And after awhile you begin to believe the propaganda.

1241
01:12:37.650 --> 01:12:42.650
So we went into life just believing that we could do anything because he had

1242
01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:47.400
ingrained that into us.
What our conversations are like today,

1243
01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:52.470
uh,
is,
um,
Levi has,
uh,

1244
01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:55.370
it will usually say,
I,

1245
01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:01.890
uh,
uh,
Daddy,
mama go,

1246
01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:07.330
uh,
Jagger has a new song called onion man.
Uh,

1247
01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:12.150
the lyrics are onion,
man,
onion,
man,
onion man,
onion man,

1248
01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:16.830
onion man over and over and over again for about half an hour.

1249
01:13:17.490 --> 01:13:18.480
Um,

1250
01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:23.010
and then my wife and I are just trying to have a conversation while they're

1251
01:13:23.011 --> 01:13:27.330
awake and then we usually talk once we get them down asleep.
But I'm actually,

1252
01:13:27.331 --> 01:13:30.030
I'll tell you a good conversation about my wife because I haven't spoken about

1253
01:13:30.031 --> 01:13:33.690
her a lot today,
but I want to give you an understanding of why I'm the way I am.

1254
01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:34.943
Um,

1255
01:13:35.550 --> 01:13:39.000
so she didn't want to date me because I was in the entertainment industry and I

1256
01:13:39.001 --> 01:13:43.200
saw her ted talk on fuck cancer and it made me want to meet her.
Um,

1257
01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:48.210
and I had to trick her into a date when I found out she was single like a year

1258
01:13:48.210 --> 01:13:51.240
later.
Um,
as you do that,
well,

1259
01:13:51.241 --> 01:13:53.430
she thought she was going to drinks with a bunch of people and when she showed

1260
01:13:53.431 --> 01:13:57.940
up it was just me and I had my five,
my friend set it up.
Um,

1261
01:13:58.350 --> 01:14:02.220
and then like the first date,
like kind of fell in love pretty quickly.

1262
01:14:02.221 --> 01:14:06.150
And that was that.
Uh,
but now we're together for a while.

1263
01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:10.530
And I think some of you in this room might have heard that Justin Bieber had a

1264
01:14:10.590 --> 01:14:13.360
turbulent time in his life.
Um,

1265
01:14:13.450 --> 01:14:18.220
things weren't always so easy for the young man.
Um,
and that was a very,

1266
01:14:18.221 --> 01:14:21.820
very hard about a year and a half,
two years.
And one day,
you know,

1267
01:14:21.821 --> 01:14:24.100
he and some other clients were going through stuff and it was just like four

1268
01:14:24.101 --> 01:14:26.110
days of just really bad stuff.

1269
01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:29.620
And I was bringing it home night after night after night,
we're getting a ban,

1270
01:14:29.621 --> 01:14:33.730
I'm bringing it home.
And um,
she is just like,
look,

1271
01:14:34.570 --> 01:14:38.920
you can't keep bringing this to bed because I'm just like,
it's,
I'm,

1272
01:14:39.060 --> 01:14:40.300
I'm not getting any of you.

1273
01:14:40.301 --> 01:14:45.301
Like you gotta you gotta cut it off when we go to bed and in the Classic

1274
01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:50.170
Entertainment Prick move,
I respond with,
look,

1275
01:14:50.171 --> 01:14:51.970
you have to understand this is what I do for a living.

1276
01:14:51.971 --> 01:14:55.060
You don't appreciate what I do.
This is how I provide.
This is like,

1277
01:14:55.061 --> 01:14:57.820
this is how I'm able to do everything.

1278
01:14:58.390 --> 01:15:02.680
And my wife looks at me and she says,
okay,
cool.
You're right.

1279
01:15:03.670 --> 01:15:08.670
So I was helping someone with Chemo today I'm going to bring that to bed and um,

1280
01:15:09.730 --> 01:15:13.510
I shut up,
realized instantly and how much I loved her and said,

1281
01:15:13.511 --> 01:15:14.590
I love you so much.
Thank you.

1282
01:15:14.830 --> 01:15:18.130
Cause my wife is the number one person who introduced in my life the difference

1283
01:15:18.131 --> 01:15:21.740
between problems and inconveniences.
Hmm.

1284
01:15:22.450 --> 01:15:27.450
When we work in this world of tech or entertainment or wealth,

1285
01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.140
um,
you tend to think that what you're doing is very,
very important.

1286
01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:37.600
And 99% of the stuff I deal with is inconveniences,

1287
01:15:37.630 --> 01:15:38.920
high class inconveniences,

1288
01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:43.980
but inconveniences and what my wife deals with his problems and I think she

1289
01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:46.540
taught me the difference.
So it's given me perspective.

1290
01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:48.833
<v 10>Awesome.</v>

1291
01:15:52.310 --> 01:15:53.143
To throw it

1292
01:15:56.260 --> 01:16:00.600
<v 2>good.
You guys are very athletic.
Everyone has perfect throws.</v>

1293
01:16:01.170 --> 01:16:05.500
No one's dropped
first to sign up to the jets.
Yeah.

1294
01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:06.720
And we meet you.

1295
01:16:09.110 --> 01:16:12.800
<v 11>I appreciate you being very honest and candid and not scripted.</v>

1296
01:16:12.801 --> 01:16:15.350
I like all the stories you've been telling.
Um,

1297
01:16:15.740 --> 01:16:20.740
so a lot of people like the entertainment industry and all its fame and glory

1298
01:16:20.811 --> 01:16:24.620
and wealth and a lot of people want to stay far away from it because of all the

1299
01:16:24.621 --> 01:16:28.730
egos.
Um,
in your journey through the entertainment industry,

1300
01:16:28.731 --> 01:16:32.750
what have you learned to really like about it and what have you really hated

1301
01:16:32.751 --> 01:16:33.584
about it?

1302
01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:37.830
<v 2>Um,
what I like about it is most of the stuff I would do that I get paid for,</v>

1303
01:16:37.831 --> 01:16:38.970
I would actually do for free.

1304
01:16:39.770 --> 01:16:43.800
I like to be able to go to a show or help someone make a record or make a TV

1305
01:16:43.801 --> 01:16:47.500
show or a film or you know,
you know,

1306
01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:51.750
advise someone on a tactic.
Like that's fun.
You know,

1307
01:16:51.751 --> 01:16:55.800
most of that stuff I would do for free.
The bullshit is what I get paid for.

1308
01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:57.540
You know,
the stuff that I hate,

1309
01:16:57.541 --> 01:17:01.710
the inconvenience first prompts and people not understanding the difference.
Um,

1310
01:17:01.860 --> 01:17:06.510
but the hardest part,
uh,
is that answer the good part.
Good.
Well enough.

1311
01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:12.020
Um,
and also like you're in an elevator or when you're in a restaurant and the

1312
01:17:12.021 --> 01:17:14.360
background music is a record that you are a part of,

1313
01:17:14.810 --> 01:17:17.300
that's actually a really cool feeling because like you're not really paying

1314
01:17:17.301 --> 01:17:19.910
attention and you're like,
why do I know this?
And all of a sudden you're like,
oh,

1315
01:17:19.911 --> 01:17:24.680
I helped put this together.
That's pretty damn cool.
Um,

1316
01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:28.070
or I just made 25 cents because I have the publisher.
Um,

1317
01:17:28.850 --> 01:17:29.930
uh,

1318
01:17:32.030 --> 01:17:35.810
the hard part is knowing your truth,
you know,

1319
01:17:35.850 --> 01:17:38.900
[inaudible] and I think it's highlighted entertainment because it's so high

1320
01:17:38.901 --> 01:17:39.734
profile.

1321
01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:44.840
But knowing your truth is really the hard part because people that even I think,

1322
01:17:44.841 --> 01:17:49.370
no,
my character that I've gotten to know me have been like,
you know,

1323
01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:51.530
because of their own issues or whatever,

1324
01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:55.280
they will like call you out on your truth and say,
well,
I think like you're,

1325
01:17:55.281 --> 01:17:59.270
you're in it for the wrong reasons or,
you know,
I,
you know,
they'll,

1326
01:17:59.271 --> 01:18:02.330
they'll kind of puts you down.
They'll,
they'll project their negativity onto you.

1327
01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:07.610
Um,
and because I decided early on,
okay,

1328
01:18:07.611 --> 01:18:09.740
I want to build a brand that I can build off of.

1329
01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:14.180
I did put a target on my back and having to know who I am and what I stand for

1330
01:18:14.181 --> 01:18:19.181
and what I believe in and who I love and who loves me has been the greatest

1331
01:18:19.761 --> 01:18:21.200
challenge of holding onto that.

1332
01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:26.180
So I don't get lost in other people's expectations and not even expectations.

1333
01:18:26.181 --> 01:18:30.050
Their projections of what they want to see to make themselves feel better.

1334
01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:35.240
Um,
and understanding that you don't have to be friends with everybody.

1335
01:18:35.241 --> 01:18:37.580
You can be polite to everyone.
It can be kind to everyone,

1336
01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:43.240
but you're not going to change someone if they want to project that negativity

1337
01:18:44.631 --> 01:18:47.600
on to you.
You have to just be okay with it and know it's not your truth.
And,

1338
01:18:47.930 --> 01:18:49.730
and in my industry it's very,

1339
01:18:49.731 --> 01:18:54.731
very hard sometimes to not get lost in the amount of negativity that exists.

1340
01:18:57.230 --> 01:18:59.660
People want it.
People want it.
They're not happy for each other.

1341
01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:02.060
They want to break each other down.
They don't want it.

1342
01:19:02.061 --> 01:19:06.650
They want to count your money or your success and hope that you fail.
And um,

1343
01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:10.250
right before we got on the stage,
I was joking cause we were talking about,

1344
01:19:10.251 --> 01:19:11.600
you know,
people's success and I said,
look,

1345
01:19:11.601 --> 01:19:14.060
my thing is I hope everyone's successful because I don't want to pay for your

1346
01:19:14.061 --> 01:19:16.070
vacation.
I want to,

1347
01:19:16.071 --> 01:19:18.680
I want to go on vacation with you and I want you to pay for your own vacation.

1348
01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:21.320
Like,
do you know what it's like to bring friends on vacation?

1349
01:19:21.321 --> 01:19:23.120
They can't pay for the vacation.
It's very frustrating.

1350
01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:28.200
So yeah,
I'm,
I'm telling you like if Sally,

1351
01:19:28.370 --> 01:19:32.060
we can go on vacation together and everybody stands on their own too.
It's great.

1352
01:19:32.930 --> 01:19:36.650
So I don't really,
I want everyone to be successful.
I really like,

1353
01:19:36.710 --> 01:19:39.860
one of my buddies just launched his own company and finally left an agency after

1354
01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:42.890
still,
I think 12 years.
I couldn't be happier for him.

1355
01:19:43.550 --> 01:19:45.770
Like I'm rooting for him from the top.

1356
01:19:45.771 --> 01:19:48.620
And originally he wanted to come in and I was going to get 50% of the company

1357
01:19:48.621 --> 01:19:50.840
and funded and then he changed his mind and goes,
look,

1358
01:19:50.841 --> 01:19:52.100
you'll be my first investor if I need it,

1359
01:19:52.101 --> 01:19:55.430
but I don't think I need funding right now.
And another friend who was like,

1360
01:19:55.431 --> 01:19:57.800
are you upset?
I was like,
no,
he's doing what's right for him.

1361
01:19:57.801 --> 01:20:01.190
Like I want him to win and at the end of the day,
if he becomes successful,

1362
01:20:01.191 --> 01:20:05.570
he buys dinner.
Oh,
I think it's just not getting lost in,

1363
01:20:05.571 --> 01:20:10.330
that's the hardest thing.
You got to throw it all out.
You got this,
you got this,

1364
01:20:10.331 --> 01:20:14.950
you got this?
Yes.
Wow.
I'm telling you,
I had a ball.
I'm British,

1365
01:20:14.951 --> 01:20:18.940
so we don't,
we don't couch things.
We just run away.
Use your feet.

1366
01:20:19.670 --> 01:20:20.770
Big Fates.
Hold arms.

1367
01:20:21.490 --> 01:20:23.770
It's interesting hearing you talk because you said you've always wanted to be an

1368
01:20:23.771 --> 01:20:25.990
entrepreneur,
but when the way you talk about your life,

1369
01:20:25.991 --> 01:20:30.520
it doesn't seem like your primary goal has ever really been about business or

1370
01:20:30.521 --> 01:20:31.091
about money.

1371
01:20:31.091 --> 01:20:34.120
It sounds as though you've wanted to go on a journey that's allowed you to

1372
01:20:34.121 --> 01:20:38.440
uncover what is valuable in life for you.
And now you've reached that point.

1373
01:20:39.580 --> 01:20:42.910
Would you say that's true or,
yeah,
but um,
yeah,

1374
01:20:43.070 --> 01:20:47.580
you guys got me a little time of somebody's life story.
It's so when I was a kid,

1375
01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:50.760
we moved from uh,
like the Bible Street Park area to this house,

1376
01:20:50.761 --> 01:20:52.020
like out in the boonies.

1377
01:20:52.590 --> 01:20:57.300
And this guy from Greenpeace showed up at the door and um,

1378
01:20:58.590 --> 01:21:01.950
he asked us for money,
explain everything and I was like,
oh,
this is amazing.

1379
01:21:02.010 --> 01:21:04.530
It's going to save the world.
And I went and got,
my mom was like,

1380
01:21:04.531 --> 01:21:07.230
we should write him a check.
And she's like,
look,
we give to charities,

1381
01:21:07.231 --> 01:21:09.240
but they can't just give money to every single person.

1382
01:21:09.241 --> 01:21:12.990
We got to pay bills and put food on the table.
And I was like,
no mom,

1383
01:21:12.991 --> 01:21:13.860
it's amazing Kim,
a check.

1384
01:21:13.861 --> 01:21:18.000
So I convinced my mom to give him like whatever check it was 25,
50 bucks,

1385
01:21:18.001 --> 01:21:22.680
like to support Greenpeace.
And he starts to leave and I'm like,

1386
01:21:24.810 --> 01:21:28.740
where's his car?
And my mom was like,
he doesn't have a car.

1387
01:21:29.070 --> 01:21:32.670
Part of the cause he's walking from house to house because he supporting the

1388
01:21:32.671 --> 01:21:34.440
environment.
And I was like,

1389
01:21:34.441 --> 01:21:38.940
but we don't live near a bus station or train station.

1390
01:21:38.941 --> 01:21:42.030
Like he's going to be walking four miles.
And my mom's like,
yeah,

1391
01:21:42.031 --> 01:21:44.610
that's part of it.
And I was like,
this guy's amazing.

1392
01:21:45.270 --> 01:21:48.420
But in that moment I was like,
if my mom doesn't write him a check,

1393
01:21:49.020 --> 01:21:51.270
he's just a dude walking from house to house.

1394
01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:54.030
He's too reliant on the check.

1395
01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:57.540
And I always like to figure out ways to skip steps.

1396
01:21:57.870 --> 01:22:01.650
And that was when I realized very young that money was an avenue to freedom.

1397
01:22:02.670 --> 01:22:05.070
And as I got older and got to witness a lot of people with money,

1398
01:22:05.071 --> 01:22:07.920
I realize a lot of people don't understand that and it ends up trapping them

1399
01:22:07.921 --> 01:22:08.754
even more.

1400
01:22:09.150 --> 01:22:14.150
But I think being an entrepreneur allows me to do everything that you're

1401
01:22:14.250 --> 01:22:16.170
describing.
Um,

1402
01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:21.720
and that's why I've always wanted to have financial freedom and success because

1403
01:22:21.721 --> 01:22:26.640
I don't want ever want to be limited or have my dreams or my passions or my

1404
01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:30.630
wants.
For this world to be blocked because I can't get a check from someone.

1405
01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:33.840
Um,
and I'm seeing it now,

1406
01:22:33.841 --> 01:22:38.070
like we did the telephone last year called hand in hand where we raised money

1407
01:22:38.071 --> 01:22:43.071
for the victims of the hurricane and being able to go out and do that because of

1408
01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:48.240
the power I had as an entrepreneur.
That was liberating.
Um,

1409
01:22:48.270 --> 01:22:52.800
and then people gave money.
Um,
but it's,
uh,
I agree with you.
I don't,

1410
01:22:53.190 --> 01:22:55.190
I think if I didn't look at it that way,
if I,
if I,

1411
01:22:55.500 --> 01:22:57.660
the word entrepreneur is funny cause you know,
we think,
oh,

1412
01:22:57.661 --> 01:22:58.920
it's someone who wants to make a ton of money,

1413
01:22:59.820 --> 01:23:03.270
but I ask that person what they want to do with the money,
you know,

1414
01:23:03.271 --> 01:23:04.980
and if they don't know what they want to do with the money,

1415
01:23:04.990 --> 01:23:06.160
I think there are pretty shitty

1416
01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:09.620
<v 4>entrepreneur.
I just know what I want to do with it.
I want to,
you know,</v>

1417
01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:13.510
provide for my family and my friends and I want to be able to make an impact in

1418
01:23:13.511 --> 01:23:15.550
the world.
Cause at a hundred years,
no one's going to remember me.

1419
01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.740
I don't think anyone,
no one's gonna remember any of us,

1420
01:23:17.741 --> 01:23:20.530
to be honest with you 100 years.
But I think they'll feel our impact.

1421
01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:25.980
So I want to be able to have as much capital as I need to create impact.

1422
01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:32.140
Does that answer it?
All right guys,
that might've been the,

1423
01:23:32.141 --> 01:23:35.330
the like realist best interview I've been a part of for toxic Google.

1424
01:23:35.331 --> 01:23:40.090
So over my brother.
I kind of implied that.
I'm not saying it explicitly,

1425
01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:44.680
but
I just like repeating it.
Like I said,

1426
01:23:44.681 --> 01:23:47.850
we're very competitive.
Uh,
by the way I did before I leave.
Um,

1427
01:23:47.950 --> 01:23:51.520
would you mind standing up?
Yes,
please.

1428
01:23:51.521 --> 01:23:53.290
Turn around everyone please.

1429
01:23:53.291 --> 01:23:56.200
He put together a wonderful outfit today and I want you to go around with loss.

1430
01:23:58.830 --> 01:24:01.520
<v 1>Give it up with Sanjay.
Yes.
Thank you.</v>

1431
01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:04.230
It is not that cold.

1432
01:24:07.430 --> 01:24:10.490
<v 4>Oh,
this is fun.
It's good.
Thank you so much.
Going to give it up.</v>

1433
01:24:11.020 --> 01:24:11.380
<v 1>Got It.</v>
