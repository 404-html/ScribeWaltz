1
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.020
Tom,
welcome to Google.
Thanks for having me,
man.
I'm excited to be here.
Yeah,
it's,

2
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.470
it is our pleasure.
So I'm,
as I mentioned before,

3
00:00:12.471 --> 00:00:16.180
we got going where we're very big fancy of quest nutrition.
Yes.

4
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.040
That's exciting smores.
Is that the flavor of the day?

5
00:00:19.041 --> 00:00:21.350
And I can't wait for Thursday,
which is cookies and cream.

6
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.110
<v 2>There you go.
All right.
Those are two heavy hitters,
man.
Respect on the choice.</v>

7
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.910
<v 0>Well,
thank you facilities.
Um,
so,
so Tom,
you have a wonderful story.</v>

8
00:00:29.911 --> 00:00:33.420
Very fascinating and resume if I do say so.
And I'm,
so let's start from,

9
00:00:33.421 --> 00:00:38.070
from there.
You,
you majored in film at USC,
then you went into technology,

10
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.720
right?
Obviously,
obviously.
And then you went into nutrition hat.

11
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.580
Can you kind of walk us through sort of that,
um,
that road that you took?

12
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:48.051
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

13
00:00:48.051 --> 00:00:53.051
there were a lot of changes that I'm having in my life that made those things

14
00:00:53.931 --> 00:00:55.550
happen.
So in film school,

15
00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.590
a USC film school is statistically speaking harder to get into than Harvard law.

16
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.040
And I had managed to get into USC film.
I was thinking,
Hey,

17
00:01:04.041 --> 00:01:07.250
I'm the business over here.
Like,
I'm just going to crush it.

18
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.000
And the first year I did and I did very,
very well.

19
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.980
And that set me up in my final year at USC to be able to do a thesis film and

20
00:01:15.981 --> 00:01:18.800
only four people in the entire class get to do a thesis film.

21
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.480
And I was chosen as one of them.

22
00:01:20.481 --> 00:01:24.530
So I went from no one thinking I'm going to be able to get into film school.

23
00:01:24.531 --> 00:01:28.130
The career counselors at USC literally told me to stop taking film classes cause

24
00:01:28.131 --> 00:01:30.950
they're like,
you're not going to get in.
We see this happen all the time.

25
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.760
People think they're going to get in.
They don't.
And so I said,
look,

26
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.800
I'm going to take somebody out from the admissions committee and just pin them

27
00:01:38.801 --> 00:01:40.940
down and say,
what do I need to do to get in?
So I did that.

28
00:01:40.941 --> 00:01:44.060
I took one of the guys out and I said,
um,
my sats,

29
00:01:44.061 --> 00:01:46.700
I got a nine 90 on my sats and I took it twice.

30
00:01:46.701 --> 00:01:50.480
And I'm saying that here in Google.
So I know you guys got some real sat scores,

31
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.590
which I did not.
And so the,

32
00:01:53.591 --> 00:01:56.240
the counselors are looking at my sat scores and saying,

33
00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:58.460
this isn't going to happen.
I'm sitting down with the,

34
00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.760
one of the guys in the admissions committee said,
look,
those are my sat scores.

35
00:02:01.761 --> 00:02:06.440
What do I need to do to get in?
And he said,
look,
we accept people at two phases.

36
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.950
One is an incoming freshmen and then your sat scores matter a lot.

37
00:02:09.951 --> 00:02:13.970
And then as an incoming junior and your sat scores don't matter at all because

38
00:02:13.971 --> 00:02:16.460
they're meant to just tell me how well are you going to do in school.

39
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.910
But by then you'll have had two years here at USC.
I'll just look at your grades.

40
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.730
So I'm a freshman at this time.
So he said,
look,

41
00:02:22.731 --> 00:02:24.440
just if you get grades that are good enough,

42
00:02:24.441 --> 00:02:29.270
I'm not even going to look at your sat scores.
So I took that is like,

43
00:02:29.271 --> 00:02:32.720
that's my mission.
So I went and locked myself in a dorm room for two years.

44
00:02:32.721 --> 00:02:36.020
I didn't date,
I didn't party at and drink,
do drugs,
nothing.

45
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.990
I worked and I studied and that was it.

46
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.680
And so I ended up getting into film school.
So get into film school,

47
00:02:42.681 --> 00:02:43.970
then I do well in film school,

48
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.640
get the senior thesis film and I think this is that I'm unlock,

49
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.460
I'm going to crush the senior thesis film.
I'm going to get out,

50
00:02:49.461 --> 00:02:51.560
I'm going to have the three picture deal.
I'm going to go take over.

51
00:02:51.561 --> 00:02:54.380
Hollywood's going to be amazing.
I'm going to be,
you know,

52
00:02:54.381 --> 00:02:58.520
rich and famous by the time I'm 26.
And that's that like,
right?

53
00:02:58.521 --> 00:03:01.500
Like it's all true.
And then,
uh,

54
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.110
I failed so miserably on my senior thesis film so publicly and so embarrassingly

55
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.240
that it,
it absolutely destroyed my sense of self.

56
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.380
And so as I'm crashing and burning and cause it's,

57
00:03:17.381 --> 00:03:21.820
it's pretty dog eat dog in the film industry in Los Angeles in that little

58
00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:26.200
microcosm of film school.
And so people are laughing,
excuse me,

59
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.410
laughing about how poorly the film went and all that stuff.

60
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.430
And so that's how you failed in regards to like the reception that film
received.

61
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.250
Yeah,
it really was bad.
There's just no two ways about that.

62
00:03:36.251 --> 00:03:38.500
Like even if people have been like,
oh,
Tom,
you tried so hard.

63
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.120
Like it just was a bad film.

64
00:03:40.121 --> 00:03:44.560
It was so bad in fact that I stole the master film so that can never be watched

65
00:03:44.561 --> 00:03:47.400
again.
I want to be really clear about how truly valid the sun was.

66
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.630
And so in that moment I realize,
and it's funny how often people push back.

67
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.380
What I realized was I did not have talent as a filmmaker and that's such a

68
00:03:59.111 --> 00:04:02.800
deeply uncomfortable thing for people to say or to here.

69
00:04:02.801 --> 00:04:04.780
And it was for me at the time for sure.

70
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:10.110
And it's not for me now at all because now I don't worry about innate talent.

71
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.710
I only worry about a growth mindset,
being able to get good at something.
And so,

72
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.090
excuse me,
I'm dealing with a coffee here.
Um,

73
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.810
if I had understood at that time that I could get better,

74
00:04:25.811 --> 00:04:28.540
it wouldn't have created the panic,
but I didn't think I could get better.

75
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.970
So that was the first movement.

76
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.480
Then once I leave film school,
I'm totally lost.

77
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.700
I realize I'm a talentless hack.

78
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.890
I don't know what I'm going to do with my life anymore.

79
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.310
I decide that I'm the only path for me is going to be to become the king of

80
00:04:50.311 --> 00:04:54.360
remedial jobs.
And I wanted it to feel good about myself.

81
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:59.130
And so I was going into positions where I'd be interviewing where I knew I'd be

82
00:04:59.131 --> 00:05:01.710
smarter than the person interviewing me.
And

83
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.320
the likelihood of the job,

84
00:05:04.321 --> 00:05:09.321
me getting the job was virtually 100% and so that was where I was and I was

85
00:05:09.421 --> 00:05:11.070
selling video games,
retail.

86
00:05:11.071 --> 00:05:15.570
And I mean this is after getting a degree and having tens of thousands of

87
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.740
dollars in student loan debt,
I'm working in these really dead end jobs,

88
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.590
just trying to make ends meet and trying to figure out what I'm going to do with

89
00:05:22.591 --> 00:05:24.540
my life.
So you purposely aimed lower.

90
00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.830
I literally purposely aim lower and it was an ego boost and it was great.

91
00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:34.190
And then luckily somebody offered me a job teaching at a film school and I

92
00:05:35.701 --> 00:05:39.120
thought,
okay,
well those that can do and those that can't teach,
so this is,

93
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:40.800
this is perfect.

94
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.340
And I start teaching and I realized,
Whoa,
like I'm,

95
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.350
I'm embarrassing myself in front of the class.
I,

96
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.020
oddly enough actually don't know enough to be teaching this.

97
00:05:52.021 --> 00:05:54.990
So I'm going to have to go home at night and learn

98
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.550
enough in the lesson

99
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.080
<v 0>to be able to come in the next day and teach.
But then as I start doing that,</v>

100
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.880
I actually started improving.
And so I start thinking,
well,

101
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.470
if I can make my own films better or can I help them make their films better and

102
00:06:12.471 --> 00:06:14.180
if I can kind of make my own better.

103
00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.720
So at this point you're well like two,
two years removed from school.

104
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:20.880
What timeframe?
We're looking from USC.

105
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.630
<v 2>Yeah.
So it had exactly that.
About two years out.</v>

106
00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.550
<v 0>And so you're teaching,
you're kind of,
you know,
touching up on your own career,</v>

107
00:06:29.551 --> 00:06:33.450
I suppose as a filmmaker.
And then how did that lead into oh wait,
nutrition

108
00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:39.240
<v 2>that,
so we now we have to cross the chasm between be considering myself,</v>

109
00:06:39.241 --> 00:06:40.650
the king of remedial jobs,

110
00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.600
then realizing that I can help these people make their films better.

111
00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.910
And by the transitive property I should be able to make my films better.

112
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.560
So that is the beginning of me really thinking about a growth mindset.

113
00:06:56.561 --> 00:06:57.700
Which up until that point,

114
00:06:57.701 --> 00:07:01.750
I had never had a growth mindset and Carol Dweck had not yet written her seminal

115
00:07:01.751 --> 00:07:04.630
book growth mindset on the topic.
So

116
00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.910
<v 0>Nick,
can you explain a little bit about the differences between like that growth</v>

117
00:07:07.911 --> 00:07:09.290
mindset and the fixed mindset?

118
00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:12.030
<v 2>Yeah,
definitely.
So a fixed mindset,</v>

119
00:07:12.031 --> 00:07:16.590
somebody that has a fixed mindset believes that their talent and intelligence

120
00:07:16.591 --> 00:07:20.820
are fixed traits,
that whatever you're born with,
that's it.

121
00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:23.880
Those are going to be,
that's as good as you're ever going to be.
And so,
hey,

122
00:07:23.881 --> 00:07:24.714
make the most of it.

123
00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.220
Somebody that has a growth mindset realizes that that's just your starting off

124
00:07:29.221 --> 00:07:34.200
point.
And while we may not all be equal from where our starting off point is,

125
00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:39.360
the human animal is literally designed from the ground up to be able to adapt.

126
00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:44.630
And so it begins to be a question of how much are you willing to adapt?

127
00:07:44.701 --> 00:07:49.290
What price are you willing to pay to get great at something?
And so teaching,

128
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:54.400
I'm determined to survive this interview here.

129
00:07:55.780 --> 00:08:00.040
Teaching was the first thing that really began to give me that sense that,
okay,

130
00:08:00.041 --> 00:08:02.920
wait a second.
I could put time into this,
I could learn,
I could grow,

131
00:08:02.921 --> 00:08:06.730
I could get better.
And while I'm teaching,

132
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:12.510
these two guys come in and they see me teaching and they were very successful

133
00:08:12.581 --> 00:08:17.470
entrepreneurs and ironically they were bodybuilders.
Now as a kid growing up,

134
00:08:17.471 --> 00:08:19.960
I had promised myself two things.
So growing up in Tacoma,

135
00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:23.110
a slightly chubby kid in a morbidly obese family,

136
00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.620
that teeter between blue collar and white collar.
I'd promise myself,

137
00:08:26.621 --> 00:08:29.680
one day I'll be rich and one day I'll have six pack abs.

138
00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:34.180
And so these two guys walk in,
they're rich and they have six pack abs.

139
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:38.290
And they were like,
Hey,
you're pretty bright.
We're about to start this company.

140
00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:42.310
We need a copywriter.
Why don't you come be a copywriter for us?

141
00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:45.490
But don't think of yourself as a copywriter.

142
00:08:45.491 --> 00:08:48.250
Understand that you can have any role that you want in this company.

143
00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:50.230
You just have to become the right person for the job.

144
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.410
And so I was just young enough and just hungry enough to,
you know,

145
00:08:53.411 --> 00:08:57.090
really transformed my life and make of it that I leapt at the chance.

146
00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:01.650
I left my teaching position,
I went out,
started working with them,

147
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:05.730
and through that process of building that company,

148
00:09:05.731 --> 00:09:10.350
and this is a very long story that I think is,
is powerful and interesting,

149
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.810
but I'll spare you so that we can cover some other topics,

150
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:17.730
but it ends with me having an emotional crisis and to really

151
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:25.040
the first emotional crisis is I'm arguing for things that I know are worth for

152
00:09:25.921 --> 00:09:29.310
the company,
which means that they're less likely to make me rich,

153
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.010
but because they were my idea.

154
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:35.490
So I'm fighting tooth and nail for an idea that I know is wrong,

155
00:09:35.491 --> 00:09:37.260
that I know will move the company backwards,

156
00:09:37.261 --> 00:09:40.800
that I have a voice in my head screaming,
you know,
this isn't going to work,

157
00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:43.620
but I so want to be right.

158
00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:48.210
I so needed to be right that I keep pushing and I keep arguing.

159
00:09:48.211 --> 00:09:51.210
And then finally one day,
because my partners were much smarter than I am,

160
00:09:51.211 --> 00:09:55.530
they just and all define intellect is the ability to process raw data rapidly.

161
00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:58.320
So they could just process raw data very fast.

162
00:09:58.321 --> 00:10:03.240
They could think through the situation faster than I could
because of that.

163
00:10:03.241 --> 00:10:07.140
I was always feeling badly about myself because I just could not think them.

164
00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:10.710
And because at that point I had a fixed mindset and I valued myself and being

165
00:10:10.711 --> 00:10:13.800
right,
good,
smart,
worthy,
right?

166
00:10:13.801 --> 00:10:17.280
All permanent states of being because someone with a fixed mindset believes

167
00:10:17.281 --> 00:10:19.020
everything is a permanent state of being.

168
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:23.700
So I needed to win this argument and ironically

169
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:30.390
I ended up winning the argument to my detriment and realize,
okay,

170
00:10:30.391 --> 00:10:33.030
now what?
And I have this moment of crisis where I'm like,

171
00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.810
I always tell people what I really want in life is to be rich.

172
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:41.990
But I'm acting as if what I really want is to just feel good about myself on a

173
00:10:42.841 --> 00:10:43.890
neurochemical level.

174
00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.580
So in a way you find it for this idea that you knew was wrong,

175
00:10:47.581 --> 00:10:50.040
was kind of a good way of a certain control over the situation.

176
00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:53.160
It was my way of being,
right?

177
00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:58.020
And because I valued that and my self esteem was built around being smart and

178
00:10:58.021 --> 00:10:58.854
being right.

179
00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:03.450
If I was around people who were smarter than me and I was always wrong,

180
00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:06.390
then I had no self esteem.
And so

181
00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.040
I literally then end up asking myself that very question,

182
00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.680
which is just be honest about what you want.

183
00:11:13.681 --> 00:11:16.440
Like if what you want is to feel good about yourself,

184
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:20.190
then you need to leave this environment because you don't feel good around these

185
00:11:20.191 --> 00:11:24.540
people that are smarter than you.
They've got more good ideas than you,
so leave.

186
00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:27.150
But if on the other hand,
what you really want is your goal,

187
00:11:27.151 --> 00:11:29.940
you actually want to get rich,
which was my obsession at the time,

188
00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:33.990
then you've got to figure out another way to think about your self esteem.

189
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:36.000
And that's what I did.

190
00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:37.960
<v 3>Okay,</v>

191
00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:42.010
<v 2>so in that moment I realized I needed to switch what I built my self esteem</v>

192
00:11:42.011 --> 00:11:45.100
around to something that is antifragile.
Now,

193
00:11:45.101 --> 00:11:46.990
at the time I didn't have the words antifragile.

194
00:11:46.991 --> 00:11:51.790
If you guys have and seem to labs book by that name,
then you know what he means.

195
00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:54.760
Something that resilient or strong or tough,

196
00:11:54.761 --> 00:11:56.590
they're still all defined by their breaking point,

197
00:11:57.010 --> 00:12:00.790
but something that's antifragile actually gets stronger the more you attack it.

198
00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:05.140
And so I was trying to think of what is something that's going to make me feel

199
00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:08.740
better about myself?
The more I realize I'm wrong,

200
00:12:08.741 --> 00:12:10.510
the more I realize that I'm stupid,

201
00:12:10.511 --> 00:12:13.510
not the smartest person had the worst idea that I'm not yet good enough.

202
00:12:13.511 --> 00:12:17.560
All those things like how do I make that,
not a liability,
but my very strength,

203
00:12:17.561 --> 00:12:19.030
the very thing that's driving me.

204
00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:25.240
And that became flipping what I built my self esteem around to building it

205
00:12:25.241 --> 00:12:28.630
around,
identifying the right answer faster than anyone else.

206
00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:32.950
Always being willing to admit when I was wrong and actually taking pride in
that.

207
00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.690
So that in a business meeting,

208
00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:38.980
if 30 seconds before I had been arguing tooth and nail about an idea,
it's mine,

209
00:12:38.981 --> 00:12:40.510
I believe in it.
I'm going after it.

210
00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:44.590
And then somebody says something and I realized they're right.

211
00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:50.320
Then on a dime I would stop and say,
you've got the right answer.

212
00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.140
And then I would become the energy behind that idea.

213
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:58.500
And that was the first real crisis of readjusting sort of your expectation

214
00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:03.970
around your self esteem and your values.
100% and as soon as I made that switch,

215
00:13:03.971 --> 00:13:07.390
I started moving up in the company very,
very quickly.
So,

216
00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:09.550
<v 4>okay,</v>

217
00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:12.730
<v 2>now flash forward a few years I become an owner in the company through sweat</v>

218
00:13:12.731 --> 00:13:15.520
equity.
The company is worth at the height.

219
00:13:15.521 --> 00:13:18.880
I think it was valued at like $22 million.
So on paper,

220
00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.650
I'm a multimillionaire.

221
00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:26.320
My salary's higher than it's ever been in my life and now I'm completely

222
00:13:26.321 --> 00:13:30.790
miserable.
And I'm like,
I'm living the cliche of money,
can't buy happiness.

223
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:32.380
And I'm like,
this is a joke.

224
00:13:32.381 --> 00:13:34.960
Like this was so predictable and so easy to see coming.

225
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:37.360
How have I actually gotten caught in this trap?

226
00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:42.870
And I began to realize that I wasn't pursuing things that gave me more energy.

227
00:13:43.481 --> 00:13:46.750
I was pursuing something that was taking more energy than it was giving.

228
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:49.450
I wasn't pursuing something that I was passionate about.

229
00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:51.540
<v 4>Okay?</v>

230
00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:55.500
<v 2>And what I didn't yet understand about money is that money is in and of itself.</v>

231
00:13:55.501 --> 00:13:56.370
It's a nerve,
right?

232
00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:01.400
Nobody's safe for maybe Scrooge MCDUCK and possibly Warren buffet like would

233
00:14:01.861 --> 00:14:05.340
actually get off on swimming in their own money.
Right?
So it's not the money,

234
00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:06.840
right.
When you talk to Warren Buffet,

235
00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.430
part of what drives him is it's a scorecard,
right?

236
00:14:09.431 --> 00:14:12.990
And he gets off on the scorecard.
But if you don't,

237
00:14:12.991 --> 00:14:17.460
if that's not your thing and it's not mine.
So I'm building this business,

238
00:14:17.461 --> 00:14:20.250
I'm learning all these skills.
I'm coming in,
I'm working my ass off,

239
00:14:20.251 --> 00:14:22.500
I'm working seven days a week,
I'm not taking days off.

240
00:14:22.501 --> 00:14:26.220
I'm damaging my relationship at home and all for what money.

241
00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:31.590
Now,
the vast majority of my wealth at the time was tied up in the equity of the

242
00:14:31.591 --> 00:14:34.560
company,
which basically means you have none,
right?

243
00:14:34.561 --> 00:14:37.800
So most people don't even understand the difference between paper money in

244
00:14:37.801 --> 00:14:40.650
liquid cash.
Paper money is not interesting.

245
00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:44.160
Like they'll write about it in Forbes magazine and kids will come up to me

246
00:14:44.161 --> 00:14:47.580
freaking out because they know my net worth is crazy high.
And I'm like,

247
00:14:47.581 --> 00:14:50.940
the only thing you should care about is how much money do I have where I can go

248
00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.770
now manifest something in the real world,
build a business by something,
whatever.

249
00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:57.230
And that's a totally different game.
So

250
00:14:59.410 --> 00:14:59.890
<v 1>okay,</v>

251
00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:03.790
<v 2>at that moment I'm thinking this is total misery.</v>

252
00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:09.900
I want to wake up every day and enjoy my life to have more energy being given to

253
00:15:10.511 --> 00:15:11.410
me then taken away.

254
00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:16.210
And in that moment I realized the game I'm playing isn't money.

255
00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:18.970
It's not success,
it's brain chemistry.

256
00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:22.870
And if the game that I'm playing is brain chemistry,
which I'll say another way,

257
00:15:22.871 --> 00:15:27.340
deep and lasting fulfillment,
the thing that as a human makes us feel good.

258
00:15:27.341 --> 00:15:30.370
The thing that we're all secret deep down,
no matter what you tell people,

259
00:15:30.371 --> 00:15:33.730
you're chasing the thing,
you're actually chasing us.
Fulfillment.

260
00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:36.340
You want to feel good about who you are.

261
00:15:36.341 --> 00:15:38.350
You want to feel good about your contributions.

262
00:15:38.351 --> 00:15:41.890
You want to feel good about meaning and purpose in your life.

263
00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:45.670
So those are the things ultimately that people are chasing.

264
00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:49.360
They think that money is going to give that to them and that they're wrong.

265
00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:50.830
And that's how they keep getting caught off guard.

266
00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:56.080
Now the reason that money is this trap that everyone can tell you as a trap and

267
00:15:56.081 --> 00:16:01.081
yet it will still capture you is because money is real and it's really powerful

268
00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:07.270
and the things that money lets you do in your life is almost unimaginable until

269
00:16:07.271 --> 00:16:09.940
you have money.
And I see now what I'm doing.

270
00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:13.360
Finally now having real liquid assets that are significant.

271
00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:17.830
You can guys think for one second right now.

272
00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.890
Imagine closing your eyes and thinking about that thing you most want,

273
00:16:20.891 --> 00:16:22.600
the thing you want to build.
It's something beautiful.

274
00:16:22.601 --> 00:16:23.890
It's something you want to leave your humanity.

275
00:16:23.891 --> 00:16:28.120
I will just assume it isn't dumb shit like a car,
right?

276
00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:29.440
It's really something.

277
00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:31.990
It's something you want to build and give and it's going to be,

278
00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:34.240
I don't think in legacy,
but like I get the sentiment.

279
00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:35.440
It's going to be your legacy.

280
00:16:35.441 --> 00:16:39.190
It's going to be that thing that outlasts you or helps other people or offers

281
00:16:39.191 --> 00:16:41.320
jobs or build something that we all want.

282
00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:45.790
The only thing stopping you from doing it,
you're going to say it's time,

283
00:16:45.791 --> 00:16:49.840
but it's not time.
It's money and that's how money gets people.

284
00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:53.170
Because once you know what you want to build with it,

285
00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:56.290
then it's really powerful.

286
00:16:56.710 --> 00:17:01.120
But if you're chasing money in and of itself,
you'll burn out.

287
00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:04.810
I promise you won't enjoy your life because you're not thinking about that end

288
00:17:04.811 --> 00:17:08.950
result.
So for the first,
so anyway,
at the height of all that,

289
00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:11.030
<v 1>okay,</v>

290
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:15.980
<v 2>making money,
wealthy on paper,
totally miserable.
I go into my partners and I say,</v>

291
00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.210
here's your equity back.

292
00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:21.350
So literally me essentially sliding $2 million back across the table.

293
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.980
Thank you.
I'm quitting.
I can't do this anymore.

294
00:17:24.981 --> 00:17:27.770
I'm not willing to keep chasing money.
I want to feel alive.

295
00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:31.280
That was the statement I kept saying,
I want to feel alive.

296
00:17:31.281 --> 00:17:33.680
I want to go do a do something that you know,

297
00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:38.240
brings me that sense of fulfillment and this isn't it.
And they said,
look,

298
00:17:38.241 --> 00:17:41.660
come out to dinner with us.
They were taken aback,
very surprised.

299
00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:45.500
We just gave them back $2 million,
gain back $2 million in quit.
And you know,

300
00:17:45.501 --> 00:17:49.950
it was like,
this is goodbye.
And so it was super abrupt.
They said,

301
00:17:49.951 --> 00:17:52.440
come out to dinner with us and I go out and they said,

302
00:17:52.441 --> 00:17:54.990
we could do this without you,
but we don't want to.

303
00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:59.610
And that phrase change the course of my life because what it allowed me to do

304
00:17:59.611 --> 00:18:03.060
was connect to something other than the money.
And so for the first time,

305
00:18:03.061 --> 00:18:03.661
but that point,

306
00:18:03.661 --> 00:18:07.920
I mean we were six or seven years into the company of literally just around the

307
00:18:07.921 --> 00:18:09.210
clock,
around the clock,

308
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:12.780
to give you an idea of how hardcore I was and how I had worked my way into

309
00:18:12.781 --> 00:18:14.760
equity starting as a copywriter.

310
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:20.720
I rented an apartment that I timed so I could make sure that if my business

311
00:18:21.121 --> 00:18:23.700
partners,
which remember at that time I was just our copywriter,

312
00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:27.240
if they were to ever call me at two in the morning on a Saturday,

313
00:18:27.241 --> 00:18:30.780
that I would be to their house in less than 10 minutes.
So I timed,
I would,

314
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:34.440
my wife would find an apartment she liked and then we would drive first to one

315
00:18:34.441 --> 00:18:34.801
partner,

316
00:18:34.801 --> 00:18:38.670
then back then to the other partner and see if both of them were less than seven

317
00:18:38.671 --> 00:18:42.360
minutes is what I was aiming for.
And that was how we picked our apartment.

318
00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.850
So that's how die hard I was.

319
00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:49.680
Now they had made the same offer to everybody basically in the company they

320
00:18:49.681 --> 00:18:53.310
would say,
we don't look for employees,
we settled for employees,

321
00:18:53.311 --> 00:18:54.960
but we're always looking for partners.

322
00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:01.000
And so I had really taken them up on that and that's how sort of all in I was.

323
00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:04.840
So now after doing that for so many years and realizing it didn't bring me the

324
00:19:04.841 --> 00:19:08.050
fulfillment that I wanted,
my wife having to pull me aside and saying,

325
00:19:08.051 --> 00:19:12.260
you're damaging our relationship because you work so much.
My response was,

326
00:19:12.261 --> 00:19:14.620
and I want balance in my life because I don't believe in balance.

327
00:19:14.621 --> 00:19:16.120
And if you guys have ever seen my content,

328
00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:18.910
you'll never hear me preach about balance or patients.
None of that.

329
00:19:18.911 --> 00:19:20.530
Cause I have none of it.

330
00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:22.093
<v 1>Okay.</v>

331
00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:26.890
<v 2>What I'm talking about is you one,
understand that passion is a process.</v>

332
00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:29.320
So there's,
there's no passion lurking within you right now.

333
00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:33.490
There are areas of interest.
Your job is to experience a whole bunch of stuff.

334
00:19:33.491 --> 00:19:37.450
Find those areas of interest.
So,
and then build them out.
Right?
Correct.

335
00:19:37.451 --> 00:19:39.160
And then I can talk about that later,

336
00:19:39.161 --> 00:19:41.650
but just to finish the story of how I ended up in nutrition.

337
00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:46.870
So when they say we could do this without you,
but we don't want to,
I realized,

338
00:19:46.871 --> 00:19:51.190
Whoa,
like that I needed that to connect to you as people.

339
00:19:51.191 --> 00:19:53.470
As you know,
we talked a lot about this brotherhood.

340
00:19:53.471 --> 00:19:57.310
We had a brotherhood and that brotherhood I realized over the years had become

341
00:19:57.311 --> 00:19:59.140
incredibly valuable to me.

342
00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.980
And it was a huge part of what helped me change as a human being was being

343
00:20:02.981 --> 00:20:06.340
connected to other people who thought like I thought who would do something as

344
00:20:06.341 --> 00:20:09.160
crazy as,
you know,
get an apartment in time it and all that.

345
00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:12.610
Cause they had a goal and they were working towards her goals and like we just

346
00:20:12.611 --> 00:20:17.560
talked the same language.
And so hearing that again and I was like,
okay,

347
00:20:17.561 --> 00:20:21.100
I can get behind that,
but if we're going to work together,

348
00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:24.040
there was just a few things that have to be true.
From my perspective,

349
00:20:24.041 --> 00:20:26.380
maybe it's not the same for you,
but for me,
here's what it would have to be.

350
00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:29.320
It would have to be a company predicated on value creation.

351
00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:31.420
It would have to be something that we're passionate about.

352
00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:34.900
We'd have to be building community and we would need to be really ourselves who

353
00:20:34.901 --> 00:20:35.740
we truly are,

354
00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:39.040
which was all a reaction to what we've been doing in the technology company,

355
00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:42.280
which was all,
by the way,
I can't believe I'm giving this talk in Google.

356
00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:46.810
I was learning Google ad words like that was my life.
And so there was,

357
00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:50.680
it wasn't like communicating with another human being.

358
00:20:50.681 --> 00:20:53.350
I was in like the bidding system and all of that.

359
00:20:53.351 --> 00:20:56.740
And what are my competitors doing and how does that impact like my bidding?

360
00:20:56.741 --> 00:20:58.210
And you know,
I mean this is like in what,

361
00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:03.480
2005 2006 and so I didn't have a sense of connection to the consumer.

362
00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:09.080
And so I really wanted to connect with them.
I wanted to build like,
um,

363
00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:13.840
a community.
And so by the time we end up launching the company,
this is now 2009,

364
00:21:13.841 --> 00:21:16.330
2010 Facebook is coming along.

365
00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:20.230
Everybody's starting to think about as individuals,
how do we connect?

366
00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:25.410
And then I started thinking about how do we connect as consumers too or as the

367
00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:30.450
company to the consumer and thinking really what social media is.

368
00:21:30.451 --> 00:21:34.540
It's just a megaphone and it's going to give people the opportunity to say

369
00:21:34.541 --> 00:21:37.510
something about your company within minutes of an interaction with your company

370
00:21:37.511 --> 00:21:41.320
to a global audience.
And so I was like,
if you guys can get excited about that,

371
00:21:41.321 --> 00:21:44.230
and I'm quoting Kevin Kelly's thousand true fans and all that,

372
00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:47.500
because in my desperation I've been reading about stuff just trying to figure

373
00:21:47.501 --> 00:21:51.520
out what's another way to do this.
And so they said,
you know,

374
00:21:51.521 --> 00:21:52.540
we actually feel the same.

375
00:21:52.541 --> 00:21:55.660
We want to do something that's passion-based predicated on value,

376
00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:57.220
allow us to build community.
They loved it all.

377
00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:00.820
And so for three very different reasons,

378
00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:06.400
we ended up on nutrition.
I grew up in a morbidly obese family.
So for me it was,

379
00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:10.240
I needed to have a mission that was so big and so compelling that it gave me

380
00:22:10.241 --> 00:22:13.930
energy that I could show up everyday and fight for people that I could think

381
00:22:13.931 --> 00:22:14.350
about.

382
00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:18.010
And there an awesome quote often attributed to Mother Teresa that says nobody

383
00:22:18.011 --> 00:22:21.070
will act for the many,
but people will act for the one.

384
00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:24.220
So if there's someone you can picture someone you know,
someone you love,

385
00:22:24.221 --> 00:22:25.570
like you'll go to battle for them.

386
00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:30.190
So I knew I'll show up everyday and fight for my mom and my sister and I know

387
00:22:30.191 --> 00:22:34.780
that they're going to die too early if we can't figure out how to solve this

388
00:22:34.781 --> 00:22:38.800
problem of making food that people want to eat,
tastes good.

389
00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:43.150
And so that became the mission of the company was to end metabolic disease and

390
00:22:43.151 --> 00:22:48.151
to do it by making food that people can choose based on taste and it happens to

391
00:22:48.461 --> 00:22:52.690
be good for them.
Interesting.
And so,
so this process and you've finished school,

392
00:22:52.691 --> 00:22:53.980
you copywriter,

393
00:22:53.981 --> 00:22:57.550
you've kind of grown through the ranks and now it's pivot into nutrition
company.

394
00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:02.070
So then how do we go from nutrition to impact theory?
Yes.
Yeah.

395
00:23:02.071 --> 00:23:05.200
We have about storytelling and empowerment.
Yeah.

396
00:23:05.201 --> 00:23:08.050
So if you know the classic Hero's journey,

397
00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:13.480
then this is at the end of the Joseph Campbell's classic Hero's journey.

398
00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:17.860
The part that isn't often talked about is the hero returns home to bring the

399
00:23:17.861 --> 00:23:21.310
message to others.
So whatever that journey just taught him,

400
00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:24.190
he's going to come back now and he's going to help other people with that.

401
00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:29.050
And while I don't consider myself a teacher returning the film is very much me

402
00:23:29.051 --> 00:23:31.900
returning home.
Right?
It's where I started.
It's my first love,

403
00:23:31.901 --> 00:23:34.780
it's my deepest passion.
It's um,

404
00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:38.410
and it is all of those things because of its ability to impact people.

405
00:23:38.411 --> 00:23:41.470
So the irony is I wasn't trying to return to film.

406
00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:46.280
What I was trying to do is pull people out of the Matrix.
So movies have,

407
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:49.640
I think in movies they've always just spoken to me maybe more than most.

408
00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:54.320
And the movie,
the Matrix came out March 31st,
1999,
uh,

409
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:56.900
just had its anniversary.
It's 19 year anniversary.

410
00:23:57.290 --> 00:24:01.790
And I remember going to a preview screening of that movie because I'm a comic

411
00:24:01.791 --> 00:24:03.350
nerd and I was at a comic convention.

412
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:08.350
They were handing out tickets and when they're walking in to the opening scene

413
00:24:10.251 --> 00:24:14.720
basically,
and the agents show up and the cop goes,
don't worry,

414
00:24:14.721 --> 00:24:18.860
we can handle one little girl and agent Smith Goes,
no lieutenant,

415
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:23.090
your men are already dead.
And then they cut to trinity.

416
00:24:23.091 --> 00:24:27.740
She jumps into the air,
freezes in that theater that I saw that in,

417
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:30.530
everyone screamed in unison and started clapping.

418
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:34.370
Now I had never experienced something like that ever in a movie before,

419
00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:39.080
the spontaneous eruption of the entire audience in the middle of something that

420
00:24:39.081 --> 00:24:42.410
wasn't like a scream or yell.
It was like celebratory.

421
00:24:42.411 --> 00:24:43.640
They couldn't believe what they were seeing.

422
00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:46.700
And then ultimately is the movie plays out.
It's a movie about belief.

423
00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:50.570
And it was coming at a time in my life where the only thing I believed was that

424
00:24:50.571 --> 00:24:53.690
I was a talentless hack and then I had no idea how to make my life come true.

425
00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:59.080
So seeing this metaphor for belief and that what Neil really has to figure out

426
00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:03.530
as that he's the one and that first for him to finally come to believe in

427
00:25:03.531 --> 00:25:06.470
himself enough that he is the one someone has to tell him he's not the one.

428
00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:10.280
And so he's got to go on that whole journey and he's got to try the impossible.

429
00:25:10.281 --> 00:25:11.900
And it's got to be willing to face failure.

430
00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:15.680
And the fact that it works is because nobody was ever before him willing to face

431
00:25:15.681 --> 00:25:18.740
the failure.
And so because he's willing to face the failure,

432
00:25:18.741 --> 00:25:23.420
and if you remember the movie,
he fails,
he dies,
but it's only in remembering,

433
00:25:23.421 --> 00:25:24.254
wait a second,

434
00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:29.030
these are just rules and I can break the rules that he then comes back and

435
00:25:29.031 --> 00:25:32.570
realizes once he understands the rules,
once he believes in himself enough,

436
00:25:32.571 --> 00:25:33.950
then he can do all this incredible stuff.

437
00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:37.580
And I don't think we actually live in the matrix.
And if we do,

438
00:25:37.581 --> 00:25:41.120
I don't think that it really matters.
But as a metaphor,

439
00:25:41.121 --> 00:25:44.330
I think it's the perfect metaphor for the human experience because what you

440
00:25:44.331 --> 00:25:49.100
believe about yourself will entirely dictate what you do with your life.

441
00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:53.420
Okay,
now let that hang in the air now as that's hanging in the air.

442
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:54.800
Let me tell you a story.

443
00:25:54.801 --> 00:25:59.090
I started big brothering when I was 18 years old for a kid in the inner cities.

444
00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:03.140
One kid named Ms. Sean Jackson.
Sean,
I didn't know this at the time,

445
00:26:03.141 --> 00:26:04.730
but he was in an abusive household.

446
00:26:04.731 --> 00:26:09.731
He had been adopted and his mother was just brutal and he always wanted to spend

447
00:26:10.161 --> 00:26:11.900
time with me.
And so when I first,

448
00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:13.910
at first it was just supposed to be an eight week program,

449
00:26:13.911 --> 00:26:16.760
I was going to go in and help him with his homework.
At six weeks,
they tell you,

450
00:26:16.761 --> 00:26:19.880
hey,
make sure you warn them that you're only coming for two more weeks.

451
00:26:19.881 --> 00:26:22.850
I warn him,
he goes,
nuclear,
unlike anything I've ever seen in my life.

452
00:26:22.851 --> 00:26:25.610
Freaking out,
crying,
fighting with other kids.
I mean,

453
00:26:25.611 --> 00:26:30.020
just like a whirling dervish,
she was pure insanity.
Finally get them over.

454
00:26:30.021 --> 00:26:32.480
And I said,
is this because I said,
I'm only coming for two more weeks?
He says,

455
00:26:32.481 --> 00:26:33.920
yes.
I say,
all right,
look,

456
00:26:33.921 --> 00:26:37.880
I'll make you a promise if you'll settle down and do your homework.

457
00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:39.590
Because he was always hard to wrangle.

458
00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:42.950
If you'll settle down and do your homework as long as I live in Los,

459
00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:45.990
I'll tutor you deal deal.

460
00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:49.050
That ends up being an eight and a half year relationship that sees me helping.

461
00:26:49.051 --> 00:26:52.770
I become the guardian of the court when he gets taken away from his abusive

462
00:26:52.771 --> 00:26:56.730
stepmother or adoptive mother.
And I remember thinking,

463
00:26:56.731 --> 00:26:57.840
this kid's amazing,

464
00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:02.970
like he's so interesting and he's so interested in just like theirs.
It's just,

465
00:27:02.971 --> 00:27:03.810
he's amazing.

466
00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:08.580
But he once said to me the phrase,

467
00:27:08.581 --> 00:27:13.170
I already been had that and I said to him,
you already been had that.

468
00:27:13.171 --> 00:27:15.120
And he was like,
yeah,
I already been had that.
And I was like,

469
00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:18.150
you already been had that.

470
00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:20.700
And in that moment I realized he actually thought that's how you said it.

471
00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:25.050
And so he goes,
well,
that's how my teacher says it.
And I was like,
oh my God.

472
00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:26.150
And so here I am,

473
00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:30.300
19 years old and this crashing realization hits me that because of where he's

474
00:27:30.301 --> 00:27:32.670
born,
his options have just been limited.

475
00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:36.300
Then if you ask him what he wants to do with his life,
his dreams are some small,

476
00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:39.510
he's got no big dreams.
So I'm like,
wow,
strike two.

477
00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:44.700
And then of course data now has come out just in treasure troves about how much

478
00:27:44.701 --> 00:27:48.460
your zip code is going to determine your future success.
But I was living at,

479
00:27:48.461 --> 00:27:53.250
I was seeing it happen before my eyes and then flash forward in quest

480
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:55.080
manufacturing and manufacturing,

481
00:27:55.081 --> 00:27:59.850
you're in inner cities because that's where the zoning happens so that you can

482
00:27:59.851 --> 00:28:02.670
actually get the kinds of things that I'm,

483
00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:04.710
the kind of square footage that you need.

484
00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:10.350
And so now I've got a thousand employees that all grew up like Rashawn and a

485
00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:12.180
thousand people with small dreams.
And I started as a,

486
00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:15.900
in the interviewing process because in the beginning everyone interviewed with

487
00:28:15.901 --> 00:28:17.520
me,
whether you were the,
you know,

488
00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:21.960
a chief sales officer or you were the janitor,
you've interviewed with me.

489
00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:27.210
And so I just,
I saw thousands,
I've probably interviewed,
oh man.

490
00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:31.460
Probably close to 3000 people at this point.
It was just crazy.

491
00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:36.230
And every one of them I would ask the magic genie question.
Magic Genie.

492
00:28:36.231 --> 00:28:36.771
He's about to show up.

493
00:28:36.771 --> 00:28:40.370
They're going to grant you one wish and one wish only can't wish for something

494
00:28:40.371 --> 00:28:41.660
for yourself.
So you can't,
or sorry,

495
00:28:41.661 --> 00:28:44.810
you can't wish for something for somebody else to cure cancer brings somebody

496
00:28:44.811 --> 00:28:46.100
back from the dead.
Whatever it's gotta be for you.

497
00:28:46.101 --> 00:28:49.670
What do you wish for every single person,

498
00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:55.190
every single person said the same thing.
Any guesses what they said?

499
00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:00.850
That would have been so smart.
I did tell him they couldn't wish for more wishes,

500
00:29:00.851 --> 00:29:03.550
so I didn't get that one.
They never would've thought to do that though.

501
00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:08.410
So not a single person ever said that first.
I sent a job.
Okay,

502
00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:10.690
fair enough.
Right.
You're here for an interview.

503
00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:13.090
You think that's what I want to hear.
You think it's a trick question.

504
00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:17.770
So then I would say,
I get why you said that.
That's not really what you want.

505
00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:22.120
Is it?
No,
ha ha.
It's not,
okay,
what do you really want?
Money.
Okay,

506
00:29:22.121 --> 00:29:23.680
fantastic.
How much money?

507
00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:27.250
I never got any answer other than one.

508
00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:32.350
And the answer was $1 million every time.
And you could wish for anything,

509
00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:37.470
anything over and over and over you could ask for $1 trillion and you asked for

510
00:29:39.371 --> 00:29:43.360
a million and it just,
it actually started to scare me.

511
00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:45.130
Now that's a really long story,

512
00:29:45.131 --> 00:29:48.670
but you need to understand like how deeply that embedded itself,

513
00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:53.290
you've got Rashawn and me feeling like I totally failed to help him avoid what I

514
00:29:53.291 --> 00:29:54.910
could see was going to be his future.

515
00:29:55.150 --> 00:30:00.150
And then you have a thousand Russians and now I feel responsible to help change

516
00:30:00.641 --> 00:30:04.360
their belief system.
And I believe if I can change their belief system,

517
00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:06.280
I can change the course of their life.

518
00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:08.980
And so we start in the same quest university and I tell people,

519
00:30:08.981 --> 00:30:10.840
making the protein bars is just your tuition.

520
00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:14.020
What you're really here to do is figuring out what you want to do with your life

521
00:30:14.021 --> 00:30:17.110
and then get the skills that you would need to go and further yourself down that

522
00:30:17.111 --> 00:30:21.820
path.
And I realize there's 25 things that I had done.

523
00:30:21.821 --> 00:30:25.750
The my mind that if they did their minds,
they would truly have a growth mindset.

524
00:30:25.751 --> 00:30:28.180
So I write these,
the impact theory,
belief system out.

525
00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:32.920
It's the 25 things anyone needs to believe and do in order to be able to

526
00:30:32.921 --> 00:30:35.740
manifest their dreams,
to actually make them come true.

527
00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:38.290
And then I started the interview show and all that.

528
00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:42.250
And then as I go through this and realize that the vast majority of these people

529
00:30:42.251 --> 00:30:44.050
do not respond to the message,
right?

530
00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:48.670
So think about how many people really respond when you just give them the direct

531
00:30:48.671 --> 00:30:51.610
answer.
This is how you do what I've done.
Most people,
they don't listen.

532
00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:55.120
It's not entertaining enough,
right?
So they just ignore it.

533
00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:57.460
Like I'll just tell you right now,
the secrets of the universe,

534
00:30:57.490 --> 00:31:00.160
anything you've ever wanted to know,
they've already been written in a book.

535
00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:02.710
You literally don't need anything else.
It's already written.

536
00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:07.360
If you were willing to go out,
read,
research,
put in the work,
practice tests,

537
00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:10.810
it's already all there.
What people really want is entertainment.

538
00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:15.040
A story a hundred percent.
So if you look at,
so I'm,
I'm a big believer,

539
00:31:15.041 --> 00:31:18.970
don't try to change behavior.
Try to leverage it.
So if you said,
Tom,

540
00:31:18.971 --> 00:31:20.290
you have to change the world,

541
00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:25.300
would you rather leverage people's reading behavior or would you rather leverage

542
00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:28.330
their viewing behavior?
The answer to me is very simple.

543
00:31:28.331 --> 00:31:33.331
I'd rather control Netflix then the library of Congress if I want to make real

544
00:31:33.761 --> 00:31:37.780
change.
So because one is just more on the surface,
just more entertaining,

545
00:31:37.781 --> 00:31:40.070
it's passive,
right?
You have to work as hard,
you know,

546
00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:42.550
flip pages you don't have to face.
Like for me,

547
00:31:42.551 --> 00:31:46.750
I always had to face the inadequacy of how slowly I read.
Um,
whereas movies,

548
00:31:46.751 --> 00:31:51.700
it was,
it was a truly emotive emotional experience.
So when I started looking at,

549
00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:54.580
okay,
how do I,
you really no bullshit,

550
00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:59.170
how do I change the lives of these thousand people or the hundreds of millions

551
00:31:59.171 --> 00:32:00.310
of people that they represent?

552
00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:04.120
How do I actually get them to adopt a belief system?
The answer is narrative.

553
00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:08.450
<v 0>Joseph Campbell,
Joseph Campbell,
and uh,
you know,
speaking of which,
um,</v>

554
00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:10.690
I love what you said about you cannot change human behavior.
You can,

555
00:32:10.691 --> 00:32:14.560
we leverage it turned down right here and um,
you know,

556
00:32:14.561 --> 00:32:17.110
do you go back to camp boy?
He said something that was a super profound as well.

557
00:32:17.111 --> 00:32:18.640
He said,
you know,
if you want to change the world,

558
00:32:18.641 --> 00:32:19.660
you have to change the metaphor.

559
00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:23.500
And I think that's what you guys are attempting to do with like your structure,

560
00:32:23.501 --> 00:32:26.170
your programs and your interviews and um,

561
00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:28.540
to kind of take this back towards empowerment.
You know,

562
00:32:28.541 --> 00:32:32.200
and you and I discuss this a little bit before we got on stage,
but you know,

563
00:32:32.201 --> 00:32:34.600
I graduated in 2010 at the height of the recession.

564
00:32:34.601 --> 00:32:39.400
So a very similar situation where,
you know,
there are no jobs.
It's frustrating.

565
00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:40.910
You know,
I'm,
I'm angry,
I'm upset.

566
00:32:40.911 --> 00:32:43.400
I can't rely on my parents cause they're in a worse situation than I am.

567
00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:47.990
And you kind of,
you know,
descend into this pit of hell where it's you're angry,

568
00:32:47.991 --> 00:32:50.510
frustrated,
all of these things.
And my question to you is like,

569
00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:53.600
I wonder as well if like before you can take the empowerment,

570
00:32:53.601 --> 00:32:57.770
but before you can own up and say,
actually I've got this,
I can do this.

571
00:32:58.070 --> 00:33:01.280
If you have to go through those trials and tribulations before he can come back

572
00:33:01.281 --> 00:33:02.080
up,

573
00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.160
<v 2>I don't think you have to.</v>

574
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:08.190
But I think that most people will need that to be the thing that they find

575
00:33:08.501 --> 00:33:11.890
themselves so profoundly unhappy that now they're moving in the opposite

576
00:33:11.891 --> 00:33:14.410
direction.
It's emotional rock bottom.
Exactly.

577
00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:17.260
So it's not a necessary component.

578
00:33:17.261 --> 00:33:19.270
I think there are people that do it without it,

579
00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:24.370
but I think that oftentimes the people that bounce back the farthest in the

580
00:33:24.371 --> 00:33:26.710
other direction are the ones that hit hardest.

581
00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:30.950
<v 0>And um,
in some of your shows and,
um,
your,
our conversation,</v>

582
00:33:30.951 --> 00:33:32.570
we've talked about this idea that it's all your fault.

583
00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:34.910
And at first glance it sounds very,
you mean,
right?

584
00:33:34.911 --> 00:33:36.530
Like everything that happens is your fault.

585
00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:40.040
But I think behind it there's like this nugget of wisdom where if,

586
00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:44.180
if you can train yourself to keep things within your realm of control,

587
00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:46.820
you'll always make the best of a situation.
You know,
everyone,

588
00:33:46.821 --> 00:33:49.400
I was really young and I fell off my bike.
I wasn't wearing my knee pads,

589
00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:53.210
you know,
I was upset and I was sad and you know,
my dad's first reply was what,

590
00:33:53.211 --> 00:33:54.310
who told you about with any pads?

591
00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:58.490
Like you were in control of that situation and it sucks at first to hear that.

592
00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:02.810
But in the long run it's sort of built this resilience and this capacity to keep

593
00:34:02.811 --> 00:34:06.440
things within your realm of control.
Now,
um,
to,

594
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:08.420
to bring this back to a question is,
you know,

595
00:34:08.421 --> 00:34:11.480
Dr. Jordan Peterson would argue that if something,
when something goes wrong,

596
00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:15.050
you start by like looking externally and seeing like,
okay,

597
00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:18.510
what was actually responsible for and what happened outside of my domain of

598
00:34:18.511 --> 00:34:22.130
control.
Whereas I think perhaps you and I would agree that maybe it's your start

599
00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:25.400
internally,
okay,
how was are responsible for this,
you know,

600
00:34:25.410 --> 00:34:29.570
was there anything I could have done differently?
And only then look outwards.

601
00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:30.990
Would you agree?
Yes.

602
00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:33.040
<v 2>Yeah.
I think that the,</v>

603
00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:37.540
the reality is that I don't care about what the reality is that's,

604
00:34:37.541 --> 00:34:38.321
that's like the truth.

605
00:34:38.321 --> 00:34:43.321
And this is where I think people get really hung up with my message is you're

606
00:34:45.251 --> 00:34:48.910
not experiencing life as it actually is.
Okay.

607
00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:51.580
You're experiencing life through three pounds,
a mush.

608
00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:56.820
That is a tri layer brain that is first trying to keep you alive,

609
00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:00.820
right?
So your most based instincts in what they call the lizard brain.

610
00:35:01.090 --> 00:35:05.110
Then you've got the Mammalian brain layered on top that's designed to give you

611
00:35:05.111 --> 00:35:07.990
the emotions that you need to move in a specific direction with a lot of

612
00:35:07.991 --> 00:35:11.680
authority and a lot of intent.
And then the thing that makes you uniquely human,

613
00:35:11.681 --> 00:35:12.520
the Neo Cortex,

614
00:35:12.521 --> 00:35:17.050
which allows you to ignore essentially those baser instincts.

615
00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:22.290
But if you know something like the deep limbic system is when it's inflamed,

616
00:35:23.771 --> 00:35:27.730
it processes data as being more negative.
So to give you an idea,

617
00:35:28.290 --> 00:35:32.890
this is one of the most fascinating things about the brain.
As Shakespeare noted,

618
00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:34.390
there is nothing good or bad,

619
00:35:34.391 --> 00:35:37.710
but thinking makes it so there's nothing good or right.

620
00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:41.180
There's just stimulus and then there's a response,
but the right.

621
00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:44.820
But people think that it is objectively a certain way.

622
00:35:44.821 --> 00:35:47.520
So now because they think it is an object objectively a certain way,

623
00:35:47.521 --> 00:35:51.810
they feel they are supposed to react based on those emotions that are getting

624
00:35:51.811 --> 00:35:55.950
kicked up in their mind.
What I'm saying is absolutely not.

625
00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:57.390
Those emotions may not serve you.

626
00:35:57.570 --> 00:36:00.240
They're certainly not aimed at moving your towards your goal.

627
00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.790
They're jobs that keep you alive,
plain and simple.

628
00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:06.600
So that's not necessarily very helpful in a modern context.

629
00:36:06.601 --> 00:36:09.480
So if you want to always be moving towards your goal,
you want to be optimized,

630
00:36:09.481 --> 00:36:11.340
you've got to learn to get control of your emotions.

631
00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:12.630
You've got to learn to understand,

632
00:36:12.631 --> 00:36:16.740
to tell yourself a narrative that isn't predicated on necessarily identifying

633
00:36:16.741 --> 00:36:17.970
what is objectively true.

634
00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:20.010
Because I don't think that we experienced the world that way.

635
00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:23.700
It's identifying what's going to work to get me to my goal.

636
00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:28.560
And that to me,
like my whole thing is goal first.

637
00:36:28.561 --> 00:36:30.150
Everything else works backwards from that.

638
00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:32.930
<v 0>I start here from the like the grand strategy,</v>

639
00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:36.430
like identifying it and then building the steps backwards to reverse engineering

640
00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:37.010
essentially.

641
00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:37.580
<v 2>Correct.</v>

642
00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:42.580
So the reason I say everything is my fault and that I use those words is it's a

643
00:36:42.801 --> 00:36:43.491
litmus test.

644
00:36:43.491 --> 00:36:46.280
If you're still having an emotional reaction to the word fault and you feel

645
00:36:46.281 --> 00:36:49.220
compelled to argue with me because you think that I'm victim shaming,

646
00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:54.230
like it just,
it tells me immediately where you are and your own journey,
right?

647
00:36:54.231 --> 00:36:58.580
Like if you're going to waste time getting lost on the words you don't like

648
00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:02.780
instead of going,
is there a part of this message that's usable for me?
Yes or no,

649
00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:06.610
then it's a filtering mechanism.

650
00:37:06.611 --> 00:37:09.310
People that haven't gotten past that first layer that they,
they,

651
00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:10.690
they first have to address that.

652
00:37:10.691 --> 00:37:12.630
Like whether or not they want to be goal oriented or,

653
00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:15.680
<v 0>yeah,
I definitely,
and something,
you know,
like I speak with,
you know,</v>

654
00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:16.630
the college students,
you know,

655
00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:21.110
there's tours or intern programs and what's most fascinating to me is that in

656
00:37:21.111 --> 00:37:22.970
order,
the thing that really try to convey to them is like,
look,

657
00:37:22.971 --> 00:37:27.200
whatever happens there can be some good from or some benefit derived from it.

658
00:37:27.201 --> 00:37:30.410
If you choose to look for that,
you know,
for that angle.
You know,

659
00:37:30.411 --> 00:37:32.420
I'm always reminded of the stoics story of I think,
uh,

660
00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:33.920
I forgot the philosopher's name at the moment,

661
00:37:33.921 --> 00:37:37.250
but he was involved in a shipwreck and his friends immediately went to console

662
00:37:37.251 --> 00:37:39.050
him to say like,
oh,
what a shame.
You know,

663
00:37:39.051 --> 00:37:40.790
we're so sorry that you lost all these things.

664
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.020
And his reply was essentially like lost.
Like,
I'm free now.

665
00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:49.100
I'm not held down by all of my possessions.
This is a fan.
This is fantastic news.

666
00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:51.530
And so I think that that's where

667
00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:54.860
a lot of our peers kind of get lost in,

668
00:37:54.861 --> 00:37:58.730
is that the lack of realization that anything hasn't benefit,

669
00:37:58.731 --> 00:38:00.560
if you can look at it that way.
Okay.

670
00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:03.590
<v 2>And I'll give you something else.
And this is something that I'm working on.</v>

671
00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:05.570
And so bear with me as I stumble through this,

672
00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:09.980
this is one of the most important things for anybody to realize and anybody that

673
00:38:09.981 --> 00:38:11.300
goes to,
um,

674
00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:18.080
to that like the world is working against me.
Like that's their default answer.

675
00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:24.150
What they have not yet figured out is that skills have utility and skills have

676
00:38:24.291 --> 00:38:25.124
utility.

677
00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:29.570
There's something in the way that we educate that leads people to believe that

678
00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:33.890
skills are this temporary thing that's merely meant to help you pass the test,

679
00:38:33.891 --> 00:38:35.860
to get the grade,
to get moved.
The next thing,

680
00:38:35.861 --> 00:38:40.120
and we've lost an understanding certainly outside of engineering that is skill

681
00:38:40.121 --> 00:38:43.420
has utility.
And what I mean by that is I believe the very purpose of life,

682
00:38:43.421 --> 00:38:46.180
the whole reason that we're all here is to close your eyes.

683
00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:51.310
Imagine a world the world that you want to become reality.
Open your eyes,

684
00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:54.740
go acquire the skills that you will need to actually build that world and

685
00:38:54.741 --> 00:38:56.290
barking your hero's journey.
Right?

686
00:38:56.470 --> 00:39:01.030
And it's acquiring those skills no longer is a metaphor.

687
00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:04.330
You're actually getting skills that allow you to do things and so people

688
00:39:04.331 --> 00:39:07.780
understand skills in that context when they're an engineer because they know,

689
00:39:07.781 --> 00:39:10.090
well,
if I know this programming language,

690
00:39:10.091 --> 00:39:13.870
then I can actually write code that can be executed in this way.
An architect,

691
00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:16.360
if I learn engineering principles,

692
00:39:16.361 --> 00:39:19.390
I can build buildings that aren't going to fall down.
Right.
They understand that,

693
00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:22.840
but like once you get into the humanities,
people no longer think about,
oh,

694
00:39:22.841 --> 00:39:26.170
skills have utility.
Like they actually do something.

695
00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:30.460
Like if I'm a teacher I should really probably learn about the developmental

696
00:39:30.461 --> 00:39:34.300
cycle of children.
Why?
Because I need to control them.
If I can get them quiet,

697
00:39:34.301 --> 00:39:37.000
paying attention in an optimal state for information,

698
00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:40.270
then I can make them better students.
That's the utility.

699
00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:43.450
Because of the things that I'm learning about how to get them to be quiet and

700
00:39:43.451 --> 00:39:45.970
where I want them and all that.
I can get them in their seats.

701
00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:48.150
I can get them paying attention,
prime them.

702
00:39:48.151 --> 00:39:52.540
Like maybe what I have to learn about is the correlation between exercise and

703
00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:56.230
cognitive optimization,
like whatever it is,
but like learning those skills.

704
00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:59.500
If you get really good at that means your students will walk out of your

705
00:39:59.501 --> 00:40:02.440
classroom better,
prepared,
better grades,

706
00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:05.020
more knowledge go on to do better,
right?

707
00:40:05.021 --> 00:40:07.960
Like they found in the Stanford marshmallow test.

708
00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:13.350
The single most correlated factor of success is the ability to delay

709
00:40:14.291 --> 00:40:15.580
gratification.
Well,

710
00:40:15.581 --> 00:40:18.730
now imagine you're a teacher and you learn to teach kids how to delay

711
00:40:18.731 --> 00:40:19.564
gratification.

712
00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:22.690
That may be the single most important thing those kids will ever learn.

713
00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:26.380
And because you learned that skill,
now that still has massive utility,

714
00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:28.570
but people don't approach the world that way.

715
00:40:28.571 --> 00:40:31.270
They're always looking for what's the broken system?
And I'm saying,

716
00:40:31.271 --> 00:40:35.290
forget about that.
Figure out how to fix a system that fine,

717
00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:38.500
but don't waste your energy trying to figure out what's broken in the system

718
00:40:38.501 --> 00:40:41.740
until you know how to fix a system.
But most people don't.

719
00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:45.880
They want to learn how to squawk.
They want to go,
I know it's broken.

720
00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:49.240
Anybody can give you that really cool speech about how the current education

721
00:40:49.241 --> 00:40:52.450
system was designed to create factory workers.
Okay,
we all know it.

722
00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:54.550
But as anybody fixing the system,
no.

723
00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:56.590
And it's not going to get fixed until somebody goes.

724
00:40:56.591 --> 00:41:00.160
I have to learn the very nature of fixing systems.

725
00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:02.650
That's the skill I have to acquire.

726
00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:07.150
And I know what its utility is and then the expected outcome in the real world.

727
00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:12.330
So when I hear people where their reaction is to bitch about a problem,

728
00:41:12.641 --> 00:41:16.390
like let's you and I were talking,
you being Hispanic is working against you,

729
00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:19.270
Jason,
you being an African American,
it's working against you.

730
00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:21.700
Like you're going to have to go uphill,
but now what?

731
00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:25.690
You're going to sit and complain about it because it won't help you.
Right?

732
00:41:25.691 --> 00:41:27.070
So if you have a goal,

733
00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:31.480
it's like it does suck that women have to work harder to get to the same place

734
00:41:31.481 --> 00:41:35.060
that has a white male in America that I have get to.
But if it is true,

735
00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:38.510
if we're all going to accept that it's true,
we can all sit there and go,

736
00:41:38.511 --> 00:41:40.610
we need to focus on the system's fair enough.

737
00:41:40.611 --> 00:41:43.970
And I'm glad that some people do that.
The other option though is to say,
well,

738
00:41:43.971 --> 00:41:45.290
I completely control me.

739
00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:48.710
And the one thing I will tell any human being alive right now,

740
00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:51.560
there is always room for the best.

741
00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:57.370
And once your able through your skills that have utility to move somebody else

742
00:41:58.251 --> 00:42:01.520
closer to their goal,
you will become a hot commodity no matter what.

743
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:05.930
No matter what.
Okay,
think about the scientist.

744
00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:09.410
What were the scientists after World War II?
Right before they were scientists.

745
00:42:09.411 --> 00:42:10.580
For us,
they were Nazis,

746
00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:14.810
but we were way happy to let go of that because they had crazy skills that we

747
00:42:14.811 --> 00:42:15.644
needed,
right?

748
00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:20.150
So really what it comes down to is what are your skills like if you've got

749
00:42:20.151 --> 00:42:22.190
skills that can be used to build something beautiful,

750
00:42:22.191 --> 00:42:25.520
to do something wonderful to the world,
to help people move towards their goals,

751
00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:27.620
that will excite the masses because they,

752
00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:30.890
they want that thing that you're going to create that it's going to improve

753
00:42:30.891 --> 00:42:31.820
people's lives.

754
00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:36.320
But only thing that mattered in all of that was you got really good at
something.

755
00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:39.020
And somewhere along the way we lost that.

756
00:42:39.021 --> 00:42:42.670
The punchline is no matter what you do to the system,
you know,

757
00:42:42.690 --> 00:42:47.450
you as an individual need to get extraordinary at something.

758
00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:51.650
And so my encouragement to people is go get extraordinary.

759
00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:55.420
Like don't worry about whether the system is broken or not.
We built quest,

760
00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:56.370
$1 billion company,

761
00:42:56.371 --> 00:43:01.371
and in less than five years coming out of the great recession so more,

762
00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:04.010
what was it in the Great Depression,

763
00:43:04.011 --> 00:43:06.650
more millionaires were created in the great depression than any other time in

764
00:43:06.651 --> 00:43:10.580
history.
It's like it just comes down to somebody goes,

765
00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:14.210
honestly,
this is how I react.
This is,
some is too big and complicated.

766
00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:17.750
I'm too afraid to try to get caught up in fixing that.

767
00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:19.290
I'm too big of a chicken there.
I just said it.

768
00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:22.460
I'm too big of a chicken to deal with that,
but I can deal with myself.

769
00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:27.110
I can go get extraordinary,
right.
So focus on that.
Go get extraordinary.

770
00:43:27.111 --> 00:43:30.050
Go become the best of whatever it is you want to be,

771
00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:34.410
but go become the best of it and see how the world opens to you.
Okay.

772
00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:37.190
<v 0>I love it.
I love it.
And it also like it's much more difficult than,</v>

773
00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:40.740
and I would argue noble to work on yourself as opposed to,
you know,

774
00:43:40.741 --> 00:43:44.000
bitching or complaining about an esoteric system which is very loosely defined a

775
00:43:44.010 --> 00:43:46.890
parent who you're speaking with.
And um,
I think that's where,

776
00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:50.190
that's where we're at and that's how I think we can empower individuals to

777
00:43:50.191 --> 00:43:51.480
become the best versions of themselves.

778
00:43:51.481 --> 00:43:54.540
Cause then in doing that they all their communities,

779
00:43:54.541 --> 00:43:58.710
their cities and hopefully the world.
Totally agree.
Awesome.
Tom,

780
00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:01.260
we have a lot more to talk about in a fortunate,
we're very limited on time.

781
00:44:01.261 --> 00:44:03.660
So I want to open up to questions from the audience,

782
00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:08.140
Mr. Excellent.
Just a question just about

783
00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:14.430
<v 5>there.
You went to Mike.
Boom,
look at that check check.
All right,</v>

784
00:44:14.450 --> 00:44:16.090
perfect.
My Derek Carr impersonation.
Ah,

785
00:44:16.091 --> 00:44:18.830
so this question actually just kind of popped into my head while you were

786
00:44:18.831 --> 00:44:23.300
talking.
Cause I totally as fan boyish as this sounds.

787
00:44:23.301 --> 00:44:26.420
I'm just put it out there like low 1000% agree with everything you've said.

788
00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:31.100
And then I thought about when you said,
um,
just go be extraordinary.

789
00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:32.940
And I'm curious to myself,

790
00:44:32.941 --> 00:44:37.470
because I also agree with the idea that human beings can be extraordinary at

791
00:44:37.471 --> 00:44:40.620
literally anything and all things that we haven't even thought of yet.

792
00:44:41.130 --> 00:44:43.410
So when you set out on your quest to become extraordinary,

793
00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:46.680
and when you sat on on your quest to become extraordinary,

794
00:44:46.681 --> 00:44:50.400
was it just let me become extraordinary in general?

795
00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:54.090
Or did you actually focus on,
I'm going to become extraordinary at this?

796
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:58.560
And final question,
what do you consider yourself to be extraordinary yet

797
00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:02.400
<v 2>awesome.
So I don't think there is extraordinary in general.</v>

798
00:45:02.670 --> 00:45:05.670
And my biggest lament,

799
00:45:05.690 --> 00:45:10.440
my biggest heartbreak is that every entrepreneur or to a person without

800
00:45:10.441 --> 00:45:14.550
exception will come to me and say,
okay,
Hey,
I've got this vision.

801
00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:18.030
I've got my mission's crystal clear,
my business plan ready to rock.

802
00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:21.030
And as you begin to push and poke,

803
00:45:21.031 --> 00:45:23.340
you'll realize they have no clarity whatsoever.

804
00:45:23.610 --> 00:45:25.680
And the best analogy is someone woke,

805
00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:29.640
and this is how the entrepreneur's approach me.
I want to win a gold metal.

806
00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:33.330
And they think the fact that they want to win a gold medal is clarity,
man.

807
00:45:33.331 --> 00:45:37.620
That they've got it on lock and I'm like,
awesome.
In the Olympics.
Yes.

808
00:45:37.621 --> 00:45:41.880
In the Olympics.
Okay,
cool.
Summer or Winter Games?
Summer.
Okay.

809
00:45:41.881 --> 00:45:46.380
Fantastic.
Tennis,
no swimming.
Yes.
Okay,
great.

810
00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:49.170
Uh,
the medley,
the backstroke,

811
00:45:49.171 --> 00:45:54.171
like until you get down to the very specific event in which you want to win that

812
00:45:54.241 --> 00:45:57.930
gold medal,
you don't know how to train right then.

813
00:45:57.930 --> 00:45:59.640
That's where it becomes an issue,
right?

814
00:45:59.641 --> 00:46:03.180
So somebody who wants to be extraordinary in general,
like how do you train?

815
00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:07.830
What does that mean?
So I need to know exactly what you want to do.

816
00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:10.200
So for me,
the thing that I want,

817
00:46:10.201 --> 00:46:13.050
and I won't say that I'm yet extraordinary in anything,

818
00:46:13.051 --> 00:46:16.200
and that's a very stoic stance and I hopefully everybody takes it.

819
00:46:16.201 --> 00:46:19.170
Like the more you learn,
the more you realize you have to learn.

820
00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:24.590
So the thing that I'm committed to becoming extraordinary at is telling stories

821
00:46:27.450 --> 00:46:30.150
that change people at the belief system level.

822
00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:34.410
So that's my goal,
right?
Where I'm just entertaining them.

823
00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:36.600
They don't know that anything else is happening.

824
00:46:36.810 --> 00:46:39.390
But that a generation or two generations from now,

825
00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:44.220
nobody would think to tell their kids anything other than everything is your

826
00:46:44.221 --> 00:46:47.430
fault to me.
Come on like you know better.
Like at the end of the day,

827
00:46:47.431 --> 00:46:50.550
your life is a reflection of your choices and they won't even remember that.

828
00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:55.530
It was a Jimminy cricket style character that told Pinocchio that in a movie

829
00:46:55.531 --> 00:46:58.980
that I made,
they just have the words to repeat.
It's that belief system.

830
00:46:58.981 --> 00:47:02.190
It's baked in,
right?
It's part of the cultural subconscious.

831
00:47:02.310 --> 00:47:05.070
We're all talking about it.
We all respond to each other that way,

832
00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:08.910
so that when somebody is woe is meaning,
we don't feed into that.

833
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.450
When somebody is saying,
oh,
this system is broken,
we immediately go,
Rad.

834
00:47:12.451 --> 00:47:16.920
What do we do about it?
How do we fix it?
What skill do we need to go repair it?

835
00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:19.800
But that's not the public discourse right now,
right?

836
00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:22.980
The public discourse right now is your victim shaming.
No,
I'm not.

837
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:24.630
I don't want them to be a victim.

838
00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:27.840
You're going to be victimized in your life of this.
I promise you.

839
00:47:28.110 --> 00:47:32.980
But you decide whether or not you're a victim,
which is a state of being.

840
00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:37.180
So all of those things right now are hotly contested.

841
00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:42.720
What I want to do through entertainment is just make it patently obvious how we

842
00:47:43.271 --> 00:47:47.860
should all be thinking,
acting to make our dreams come true.
So that's the thing.

843
00:47:47.861 --> 00:47:48.694
I want to be extraordinary.

844
00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:51.220
And then I think there was one more part to that question.

845
00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:55.970
<v 5>So the question was loaded,
so it was a,
could you be,
oh well actually no,</v>

846
00:47:55.971 --> 00:47:58.100
you answered both because it,
it's two part question.

847
00:47:58.190 --> 00:48:00.460
What did you set out to be extraordinary at?

848
00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:02.060
What do you consider yourself extraordinary yet?

849
00:48:02.090 --> 00:48:05.210
And then what are your comments on just being extraordinary,

850
00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:07.550
seeking to be extraordinary in general.
Okay.

851
00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:10.650
<v 2>I,
when I think about like what is the meaning of life?</v>

852
00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:15.150
I really believe nature made a choice with every creature it creates and it

853
00:48:15.151 --> 00:48:16.920
essentially as a bifurcated path.

854
00:48:16.921 --> 00:48:19.710
Number one is I'm going to preload you with all the algorithms.

855
00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:22.800
We call them intuition or your instincts.

856
00:48:23.130 --> 00:48:27.060
And so you come with instincts and like a horse fall when it comes out,

857
00:48:27.061 --> 00:48:31.500
it can walk.
It can run,
it can jump,
it can feed a human baby.
On the other hand,

858
00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:35.190
when it's born is a lump of flesh.
It poos in its own diapers.

859
00:48:35.191 --> 00:48:37.920
You could lay it next to a bottle and it would still starve to death.

860
00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:42.120
Like we are completely dependent because what we want to do is actually finish

861
00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:47.300
the maturing of the brain on the outside in the stimulus to which we need to

862
00:48:47.551 --> 00:48:48.390
become adapted.

863
00:48:48.690 --> 00:48:53.250
So the reason that humans have become the ultimate apex Predator,

864
00:48:53.310 --> 00:48:56.730
unlike anything this world has ever seen before ever,

865
00:48:57.060 --> 00:48:59.220
is our ability to adapt.
Now,

866
00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:04.460
if you believe that adaptation is the absolute core of what makes us great is

867
00:49:04.531 --> 00:49:08.250
our defining characteristic,
then it becomes a question of,

868
00:49:08.251 --> 00:49:11.580
well how does nature make sure that we do what nature wants us to do?

869
00:49:11.581 --> 00:49:14.730
So if nature wants us to adapt,
it's going to make it pleasurable.

870
00:49:15.210 --> 00:49:17.730
So when you think about what a human is really want,

871
00:49:17.850 --> 00:49:21.450
I think it's a deep and lasting sense of fulfillment.
Okay?
It's the,

872
00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:23.820
it's the happiness that lasts.

873
00:49:23.821 --> 00:49:28.200
It's the non transient bowl of ice cream style happiness and it's the,

874
00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:31.860
I just saved somebody from a burning building.
It's the,

875
00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:35.700
I've helped these children's lives are going to go and be better.

876
00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:39.100
It's things like that to make you feel good about who you are as a human being

877
00:49:39.101 --> 00:49:41.940
and what your contributions are.
That actually comes from suffering.

878
00:49:41.941 --> 00:49:43.200
It comes from working hard.

879
00:49:43.201 --> 00:49:47.400
It comes from putting in that effort because that's what you have to do to
adapt.

880
00:49:47.610 --> 00:49:51.720
You adapt to a stressor.
You adapt to paying,
you adapt to difficulty.

881
00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:56.100
You get stronger under heavier and heavier weight,
right?
That's how it works.

882
00:49:56.250 --> 00:49:58.830
That's just the the call and answer of nature.

883
00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:04.160
So that process is intensely pleasurable in the sense of fulfillment.

884
00:50:05.610 --> 00:50:09.060
So going out and doing the hard things to see how much of your potential you can

885
00:50:09.061 --> 00:50:09.481
actuate.

886
00:50:09.481 --> 00:50:14.481
Pursuing greatness in a very specific direction is I believe the only thing that

887
00:50:15.271 --> 00:50:20.250
will make people happy.
So when I look at depression,
anxiety,
all on the rise,

888
00:50:20.251 --> 00:50:23.070
all rampant people feeling lost,
not knowing what they want to do,

889
00:50:23.071 --> 00:50:24.000
where they want to be.

890
00:50:24.210 --> 00:50:29.210
The answer is decide you're going to be extraordinary at something because it

891
00:50:29.271 --> 00:50:30.860
gives you more energy than it takes.

892
00:50:30.861 --> 00:50:32.690
And there's a whole process and not going to go into it now,

893
00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:37.790
but get that thing in your life and then go after it with everything you have

894
00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:42.740
with total disregard for balance that you pour yourself into it in a way you

895
00:50:42.741 --> 00:50:47.180
give yourself over to it.
And I think we have one more bifurcation.

896
00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:52.420
You've got the family which provides a similar sense of deep fulfillment and I

897
00:50:52.971 --> 00:50:54.740
think that's a perfectly valid choice.

898
00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:58.190
And if you don't hear the incongruent nature with what I'm saying,

899
00:50:58.310 --> 00:51:03.020
I'm not saying it very well,
but those are the two paths at IC.
Humans go on,

900
00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:06.050
people that are parents,
they really,
the kid was born,

901
00:51:06.051 --> 00:51:08.750
changed my life perspective.
Totally done,
right?
Like you know the,

902
00:51:08.751 --> 00:51:10.550
the talk and how it feels.

903
00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:13.760
And then on this side you've got an equal lack of balance.

904
00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:16.310
All in totally committed.
Do or die,

905
00:51:16.311 --> 00:51:19.100
I would give myself over to this thing that I'm building.
Right?

906
00:51:19.101 --> 00:51:22.310
And that's where I'm at.
I've chosen not to have kids,
not the path I'm on,

907
00:51:22.730 --> 00:51:26.690
but I've given myself over in a similar way and I get a similar sense of deep

908
00:51:26.691 --> 00:51:27.524
fulfillment.

909
00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:33.660
<v 4>Great.
Great.
Thank you.
For sure.
Um,</v>

910
00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:40.080
<v 6>in terms of adopting this growth mindset,</v>

911
00:51:40.110 --> 00:51:42.990
or like just developing yourself as an individual,

912
00:51:42.991 --> 00:51:45.480
how big of a role when you say is,
um,

913
00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:50.930
managing your relationships and how important is it that the people around you

914
00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:54.960
adopt more or less the same mindset or support this mindset you're adopting?

915
00:51:55.610 --> 00:51:58.130
<v 2>So you're now poking me and my soft underbelly,</v>

916
00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:03.020
which I appreciate you asking the hard questions.
Um,
as a CEO,

917
00:52:03.050 --> 00:52:08.050
it is ridiculously important to make sure that your team is on this page,

918
00:52:08.181 --> 00:52:09.650
that they're totally bought in,

919
00:52:09.651 --> 00:52:12.020
that they're thinking the same way and acting the same way.

920
00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:16.230
Otherwise your culture begins to fragment and get toxic.
Um,

921
00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:18.470
as a person just out in the world,

922
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:22.580
it's amazing to surround yourself with other people that think like that because

923
00:52:22.581 --> 00:52:24.110
you're going to reinforce it and you,

924
00:52:24.111 --> 00:52:26.960
and that's such a beautiful thing to have in your life and they're going to push

925
00:52:26.961 --> 00:52:30.650
you and escalate you to be better.
Um,
but also as an individual,

926
00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:33.020
no one should be able to stop you.
Right?

927
00:52:33.350 --> 00:52:37.490
And so whether you're working in a toxic environment or not,

928
00:52:37.491 --> 00:52:39.260
and everybody else acts like a dumb ass.

929
00:52:39.350 --> 00:52:42.230
Like when people come to me and they write in and say,
Hey,

930
00:52:42.231 --> 00:52:44.390
I'm working in an environment because I'm a huge believer.

931
00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:47.810
If you guys haven't read Ray Dalio is principles read.
It's incredible.

932
00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:50.660
But every time I recommend it to somebody that works in a company where I

933
00:52:50.661 --> 00:52:53.360
imagine the culture for one person to change to be so hard,

934
00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:55.910
I do have little pangs of guilt.
But here's the truth.

935
00:52:55.911 --> 00:53:00.290
You could put me in in any organization in the world and the strategy that I

936
00:53:00.291 --> 00:53:05.090
would adopt if I wanted to move up and I wanted to change the culture would be

937
00:53:05.091 --> 00:53:10.091
to become useful to other people with no need to get the credit because secretly

938
00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:13.880
I know deep down inside when people steal from you,

939
00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:16.520
they know they're stealing from you,
not that they're going to feel guilt.

940
00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:17.840
I don't need them to feel guilt.

941
00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:21.740
I want them to be terrified of losing proximity to me,

942
00:53:22.250 --> 00:53:25.010
which now all of a sudden means people begin to orbit around me because I'm

943
00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:27.540
helping their life.
Then all of a sudden it's just,

944
00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:30.480
oh why is everybody orbiting around him?

945
00:53:30.481 --> 00:53:35.040
Like they're always turning to him and you ever notice like everybody knows if I

946
00:53:35.041 --> 00:53:38.310
took whoever your is running a meeting and I took them out,

947
00:53:38.730 --> 00:53:43.350
suddenly there'll be a second person that all eyes will start going to and that

948
00:53:43.351 --> 00:53:46.110
person is the unofficial leader of the group.
Right.

949
00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:49.950
And I would immediately as fast as I could by giving value to other people by

950
00:53:49.951 --> 00:53:52.200
not caring about getting any credit for my own ideas.

951
00:53:52.350 --> 00:53:56.400
But pumping out ideas that are wrapped more rapid pace by being extraordinary,

952
00:53:56.580 --> 00:54:00.660
by making sure that I'm better than this at everyone else by being more
prepared,

953
00:54:00.661 --> 00:54:05.250
by putting in more work,
all of that,
that people would begin to rotate around me.

954
00:54:05.490 --> 00:54:07.350
It's a longer strategy,

955
00:54:07.770 --> 00:54:12.420
but in in that situation now you've got a lot of clout with people and so when

956
00:54:12.421 --> 00:54:14.820
you say,
I don't do that,
I don't steal ideas,

957
00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:17.880
all of a sudden then people would start to feel guilty about stealing ideas from

958
00:54:17.881 --> 00:54:20.040
you.
You start to see a shift slowly over time,

959
00:54:20.041 --> 00:54:21.810
so I won't over answer your question,

960
00:54:21.811 --> 00:54:25.380
which I've already gotten real dangerous to.
I'll stop there,
but I'm really,

961
00:54:25.381 --> 00:54:30.381
really fascinated about antagonistic group dynamics and how to change them by

962
00:54:30.391 --> 00:54:34.950
being the unchangeable of just like having a true north about what your ethics

963
00:54:34.951 --> 00:54:36.690
are and just always being true to it.

964
00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:48.430
<v 7>That's why I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about clarifying your</v>

965
00:54:48.610 --> 00:54:52.540
goals and what you're chasing and how much of that is just choosing something

966
00:54:52.541 --> 00:54:54.250
and committing to it and going after it.

967
00:54:54.251 --> 00:54:57.130
And how much of it is really a process of figuring out what you want and

968
00:54:57.131 --> 00:55:01.330
chipping away at that end and getting very clear on it through some internal

969
00:55:01.331 --> 00:55:02.164
process.

970
00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:05.680
<v 2>Here's the amazing part.
You've actually already answered the question.
So,</v>

971
00:55:05.681 --> 00:55:10.090
and most people only get one half.
So it really is both of what you just said.

972
00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:13.720
You need to do the work first of being like,

973
00:55:13.721 --> 00:55:15.940
what do I really want?
What?

974
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:19.180
And so now walk through the process that I alluded to a couple times.

975
00:55:19.181 --> 00:55:21.250
So passion is not a lightning rod moment.

976
00:55:21.251 --> 00:55:23.890
It is not something that's hiding inside of you.
It is a process.

977
00:55:24.070 --> 00:55:26.920
You're an architect,
not an archaeologist.
Okay?

978
00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:30.610
So what you're gonna do is you're going to go experience a whole lot of stuff.

979
00:55:30.790 --> 00:55:33.040
And Kevin Kelly,
the founder of wired magazine,

980
00:55:33.041 --> 00:55:36.730
talks about not prematurely optimizing.

981
00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:40.720
And I think that that's so important.
So in life,
if you don't have a passion,

982
00:55:40.750 --> 00:55:44.410
you want to go experience a lot of things with almost total disregard for what

983
00:55:44.411 --> 00:55:47.290
that might be.
When you encounter something that you find interesting,

984
00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:50.620
engage with it more as you engage with it.
See,

985
00:55:50.621 --> 00:55:53.860
is this turning into a real fascination?
If it's turning into a real fascination,

986
00:55:53.861 --> 00:55:55.480
then ask yourself a very simple question,

987
00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:59.230
do I want to become the greatest in the world at this?

988
00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:03.700
And if the answer is yes,
if the thought of that fills you with excitement,

989
00:56:03.701 --> 00:56:07.450
winning that gold medal or designing that thing or whatever,
you think,
oh my God,

990
00:56:07.590 --> 00:56:08.770
like that would be amazing.

991
00:56:08.771 --> 00:56:11.140
And the thought of actually putting in that works kind of cool.

992
00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:13.030
Like I want to develop that skill set.

993
00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:17.080
Now you're going to go down the path of gaining mastery.
And I'm stealing this,

994
00:56:18.550 --> 00:56:19.031
excuse me,

995
00:56:19.031 --> 00:56:22.420
from a guy named cal Newport and a book called so good they can't ignore you.

996
00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:26.500
And I think that passion is like love.

997
00:56:26.530 --> 00:56:29.710
I don't believe that there's one sided love.
I think that's infatuation.

998
00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:32.890
Love is where you're in a real relationship.
There's give and take.

999
00:56:32.891 --> 00:56:36.040
There's vulnerability.
There's all the things that make real love,

1000
00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:39.970
this beautiful interplay of two brains that are actually in sync.

1001
00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:44.860
Like as in you can see it in an FMRI scanner.
It's really crazy.
Okay,
that's love.

1002
00:56:45.130 --> 00:56:47.470
Infatuation is the stage before that.

1003
00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:51.940
So you don't know if you have a passion for something until you're gaining

1004
00:56:51.941 --> 00:56:55.390
mastery.
You were sincerely pursuing becoming the best in the world at that.

1005
00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:59.800
And those skills have utility and as you put that utility to the test in service

1006
00:56:59.801 --> 00:57:02.110
of something bigger than yourself helping other people,

1007
00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:03.700
you will get energy from that.

1008
00:57:03.701 --> 00:57:06.400
As a social creature knowing I've worked my ass off for this,

1009
00:57:06.550 --> 00:57:08.230
Greeks have a name for,
it's called Techny.

1010
00:57:08.350 --> 00:57:11.830
I've worked my ass off for this set of skills and it actually helps other people

1011
00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:13.870
and it makes me feel good and I'm contributing.

1012
00:57:14.110 --> 00:57:17.590
And so that thing where it's like I show up every day and technically I'm at

1013
00:57:17.591 --> 00:57:19.810
work,
but I'm actually building something that's helping people.

1014
00:57:19.811 --> 00:57:21.790
And that makes me feel really good.
One,

1015
00:57:21.791 --> 00:57:24.670
it's hard and I'm pushing myself and I love it and it's interesting.

1016
00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:28.930
And then on the other hand,
it actually helps like,
and it's that dope interplay.

1017
00:57:29.260 --> 00:57:31.150
Now where people get stuck is,

1018
00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:34.870
we were just talking about this before we started the,
um,
the talk,

1019
00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:37.510
most people are standing in that room,

1020
00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:39.910
they've got a thousand things are interested in.

1021
00:57:40.990 --> 00:57:43.750
They can't bring themselves to shut any one of those doors.

1022
00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:46.900
And because they don't shut any one of those doors and never walked through the

1023
00:57:46.901 --> 00:57:49.510
one remaining door.
And so I always tell people,

1024
00:57:49.511 --> 00:57:52.150
your job is to shut doors.

1025
00:57:52.330 --> 00:57:55.240
Literally the word decide means to close.

1026
00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:59.140
It's like the what of break it up in Latin or to cut,
excuse me,
it means to cut,

1027
00:57:59.141 --> 00:58:00.700
to cut something out,
right?

1028
00:58:00.701 --> 00:58:05.260
So you're cutting out the 999 other options and going with just the one.

1029
00:58:05.380 --> 00:58:10.240
And if you have to do it at random and just shut blindly,
999 doors,
fine,

1030
00:58:10.270 --> 00:58:14.230
go through that one c is it a fascination or not?
And if it's not,
come back,

1031
00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:15.670
open a new one and move.

1032
00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:21.460
The only thing that's really going to ruin you as a person is indecision.

1033
00:58:22.030 --> 00:58:25.780
It's the only thing you should fear.
Well guys,
thanks so much for joining,
Tom.

1034
00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:28.480
Thank you for coming by.
Thanks for having me.
It was a pleasure and privilege.

1035
00:58:28.481 --> 00:58:29.314
Yeah.

1036
00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:33.270
