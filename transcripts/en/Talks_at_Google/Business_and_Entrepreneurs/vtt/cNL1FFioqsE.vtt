1
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.830
Thank you so much for being here.
It's so awesome to have you back at Google.
Um,

2
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.710
and we're psyched to just hear what you have to say.
Thank you,
Jesse.

3
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.960
I'm thrilled to be back.
You guys hear me okay in the back there.
Um,

4
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.140
for anyone who's watching the video,
I'm told this room seats 900,

5
00:00:23.141 --> 00:00:26.740
it's almost full.
So this is really,
this is great.

6
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.800
Uh,
so quickly,
um,

7
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.800
I'm not licensed to do this.
So as first it's probably a disclaimer,

8
00:00:35.801 --> 00:00:39.880
but Kate and Jesse invited me to come speak at an offsite here four or five or

9
00:00:39.881 --> 00:00:41.180
six months ago now.

10
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.090
But I've heard from a number of folks since sue wanted to connect.
And so,

11
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.880
so we came back,
uh,
I'm excited to do it.
Um,

12
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:54.630
I'm gonna walk you through essentially today a roadmap for,

13
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.720
you know,
thinking about your life and making a plan for your life,

14
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.710
which I can't emphasize enough.
I'm completely unqualified to do,

15
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.180
but at the same time I have found it useful.
Um,

16
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.970
people who are important to me have found it useful and you might as well,

17
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.560
we've got 60 minutes.
I have more so as as folks,
if you have to leave,

18
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.080
leave anytime.
Of course.
And I'll stay after a little while.

19
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.490
I didn't invite questions throughout and we're going to save time for questions

20
00:01:21.491 --> 00:01:25.990
at the end.
Sound good?
Good plan for today.
All right.
First I need,
um,

21
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.700
I need two volunteers to help.
Just,
it's wonderful.

22
00:01:30.701 --> 00:01:33.640
You didn't even know what I was going to ask for.
It could be anything.

23
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.580
Just tell me why you came,
what you were hoping to get out of today.

24
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:37.500
<v 2>Uh,</v>

25
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.880
so I have Jesse and I like to listen to her advice.

26
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.220
It's always good to get it out.
Take your second part

27
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.560
<v 0>outside perspective and advice.
Anyone else?
Tell me just your goal for today.</v>

28
00:01:48.561 --> 00:01:51.410
I want to make sure we achieve it.
Anyone else?

29
00:01:51.411 --> 00:01:53.180
What would you like to get out of today

30
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.823
<v 2>again?</v>

31
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.163
<v 0>Okay,</v>

32
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.250
so talking about the cloud was not in the original scope of the presentation,

33
00:02:07.251 --> 00:02:10.430
but like,
I'm here for you guys.
So outside,

34
00:02:10.431 --> 00:02:14.600
outside advice and perspective and talk about cloud.
What?
Oh,
so all right.

35
00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.110
That's what we're gonna do.
Um,
thank you Kate.

36
00:02:18.111 --> 00:02:19.850
Thank you Jesse for the invitation.

37
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.400
Thank you Alan and Matthew for getting this all set up.

38
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.730
What I want to do first is a quick exercise.
I'm going to ask you,

39
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.740
close your eyes.
You got,
I'm going to ask you to admit something for Matthew.

40
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.730
I would like you to put your hand in front of the camera.

41
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.050
You get a cover the camera,

42
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.160
and I want you to raise your hand if you are living the life and career that you

43
00:02:37.161 --> 00:02:41.750
dreamed you'd be living.
If you are on your dream life's path,

44
00:02:41.751 --> 00:02:46.130
raise your hand.
Okay,
good.
Both of you.
Put your hands down.

45
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.330
I've been there.
I know exactly.

46
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.540
I know exactly how you feel are one more thing.

47
00:02:53.541 --> 00:02:58.541
Raise your hand if you are engaged or married and of bearing years.

48
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.470
Raise your hand.
All right.
Uh,

49
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.250
download the knot and the bumps.
That's what I do for it.

50
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.270
That's what I do for a living and I would appreciate that.
So here's how

51
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.900
there's a website that I want to tell you about.
And,
and,
and,
and I,
I'll,

52
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.060
I'll give a footnote this with a friend of mine calls this,

53
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.170
this discussion,
my,
my,
my self important obsession with my own mortality,

54
00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:30.730
but I want you to play along and there's a website called [inaudible] dot com if

55
00:03:30.731 --> 00:03:35.440
you put some information into death clock.com take care of yourself.

56
00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:39.520
Do you smoke when you born?
It'll tell you,
give or take when you're going to die.

57
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.910
Now it doesn't know,
but it's from an actuarial table.
It gives you a bit,

58
00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.860
it might be right,
it might be wrong.
Mine's May,

59
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.450
2068 all right,
so we've got a deadline and we've got,

60
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.820
now I work out,
I avoid third world airlines,

61
00:03:57.821 --> 00:04:00.430
but still like there's a limited amount of time.

62
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.410
You have a limited amount of time and you,
you and I,

63
00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:10.411
we sit in this incredibly privileged position in the context of the history of

64
00:04:10.601 --> 00:04:11.434
the world.

65
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.740
The vast majority of human beings who have ever lived have the very short

66
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.390
British lives and spent most of their energy trying to have food,
shelter,

67
00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:22.240
and to defend themselves.
Right?
Like that was most people's obsessions.

68
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.900
I have a friend who,
I mean even our,
most of us in this room,

69
00:04:25.901 --> 00:04:29.080
our grandparents worked to make sure no one starved.

70
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.400
That was the purpose of work and then I get to be in a room with,

71
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.090
with folks like this who all were the smartest kids in their classes,

72
00:04:37.091 --> 00:04:39.040
went to good colleges,
work at Google.

73
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.880
Someone made a movie about what it takes to try to get a job at Google and you

74
00:04:42.881 --> 00:04:45.640
have one.
We're so fortunate.

75
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.090
Our lives are such a gift

76
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.500
and yet many of us,

77
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.850
especially those who come to obscure tech talks about planning your life,

78
00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.730
feel this,
this dissatisfaction,

79
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.680
they we feel this thing,
something is not quite right.

80
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.190
We all have the sense that we have a limited amount of time and we have this

81
00:05:09.191 --> 00:05:14.191
sense that we're blessed with something really precious amount of time and a

82
00:05:16.121 --> 00:05:19.000
really precious opportunity and we're constantly wondering if we're doing the

83
00:05:19.001 --> 00:05:21.070
right thing with it.

84
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.430
Also,
people like us have so many options,
so many options.

85
00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:28.540
Headhunters call you guys,

86
00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:33.580
they'd probably call you a lot and being recruited by other companies.

87
00:05:33.581 --> 00:05:35.470
You can really do anything.
You work here,
you could do anything.

88
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.320
And there was a study done once.

89
00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.620
Some weird psychologists had people walk into a store and there were four

90
00:05:44.621 --> 00:05:47.890
jellies on the shelf and they calculated how many jellies they bought.

91
00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.250
And then people would walk into the store and they put like 70 jellies on the

92
00:05:51.251 --> 00:05:53.110
shelf and he calculated how many jellies people bought in.

93
00:05:53.111 --> 00:05:54.970
The more jelly on the shelf,
the fewer people bought.

94
00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.630
We're paralyzed by the array of choices that we have.

95
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.170
So I'm going to walk you through a little bit about how I think about I've,

96
00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.830
how I've thought about those choices and some other folks have found those

97
00:06:06.831 --> 00:06:10.130
choices in a way that other folks have found is useful.

98
00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:11.300
A useful way to think about this choice.

99
00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.570
So I'm going to skip some swag to go back to the beginning.
Uh,

100
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.620
any presentation that starts with a definition of a word is the worst

101
00:06:18.621 --> 00:06:22.220
presentation.
But I'm sorry I did this last night for you.
Um,

102
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.950
what's important now,
that word,
there are multiple definitions.
I picked one.

103
00:06:27.951 --> 00:06:29.780
One definition is of high status.

104
00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:34.061
I like this.

105
00:06:34.061 --> 00:06:39.061
One of great significance or value likely to have a profound effect on success,

106
00:06:39.581 --> 00:06:42.400
survival or wellbeing important.

107
00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.990
And we put that in context.
The,
I'd ask you a question,
how important are you?

108
00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.730
No,
you could say,
well,

109
00:06:50.731 --> 00:06:53.940
we're all unique and beautiful snowflake were all really important.
That's fair.

110
00:06:53.941 --> 00:06:55.680
But like Mark Zuckerberg is more important than me.

111
00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.680
I'm willing to admit that he's a very big on me.

112
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:03.570
How important are you?
There's an exercise that I've done,

113
00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:07.560
uh,
and then others have found helpful then I'm going to walk you through now,

114
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:11.220
but the answers in a way,
this question,

115
00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.610
so I'll start with you.
How important are you?
This is you,

116
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.850
I don't think about the impact that your life has.
Good,

117
00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.900
honest assessment of the impact that your life has.

118
00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:25.080
I,
um,
I first did this,

119
00:07:25.081 --> 00:07:28.950
I was like 26 years old and I had this very prestigious job at a big media

120
00:07:28.951 --> 00:07:29.890
company,
uh,

121
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.300
where I worked in corporate development and strategy and we met with important

122
00:07:33.301 --> 00:07:35.130
people.
And you will.
I really,

123
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.520
I've was very big in my britches and a friend of mine was a kindergarten teacher

124
00:07:38.521 --> 00:07:43.380
and she asked me to speak at the kindergarten for a employment day for jobs day.

125
00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.370
And a little girl,
she was a kindergartener or a first grader,

126
00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:48.630
came up and said to me,

127
00:07:48.631 --> 00:07:51.870
they had these prepared questions they had asked you in the first one.
She said,

128
00:07:51.871 --> 00:07:56.190
do you bring your lunch to work?
And I was like,

129
00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:59.520
no,
that's a good idea.
I spent a lot of money on lunch.

130
00:07:59.521 --> 00:08:02.400
I should bring my lunch to work.
Thank you.
And the second thing she said,

131
00:08:02.401 --> 00:08:06.570
she said,
um,
do you work in New York City?
I said,
I do.

132
00:08:06.571 --> 00:08:08.970
I work at Rockefeller Plaza.
It's really great.

133
00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:12.930
Thank you for your questions for of course.
She said,
is your job important?

134
00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:15.660
I said,
well,

135
00:08:15.661 --> 00:08:18.990
I'm a capital allocation is an important lever of the success of a corporate

136
00:08:18.991 --> 00:08:23.700
entity.
Um,
and you know,
I guess the strategy stuff is sometimes it's obvious,

137
00:08:23.701 --> 00:08:24.001
but you know,

138
00:08:24.001 --> 00:08:27.750
someone has to do these jobs and I am going to make a lot of charts.

139
00:08:27.751 --> 00:08:29.820
And this little girl's looking at me and then she said,

140
00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:31.770
I'm supposed to write yes or no,

141
00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:35.850
and I said no.

142
00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:42.980
And I had an existential crisis from a kindergarten and I went home and I did

143
00:08:44.731 --> 00:08:47.940
this thing.
So I was like,
what am I important?
What do I do?

144
00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:50.940
Well there's me and then what things do I touch on the world?

145
00:08:50.941 --> 00:08:54.060
I think it was my family and friends and those of you who know me know I have

146
00:08:54.061 --> 00:08:58.110
like six friends.
So there's that.
Um,
I called my parents but I've been,

147
00:08:58.111 --> 00:09:02.850
this is not,
okay,
fine.
That's,
that's nice.
My,
when I described my work,

148
00:09:02.851 --> 00:09:06.300
the sort of the word,
my value over replacement player just wasn't that high.

149
00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:10.680
And the impact that I felt that I was having on the world wasn't that inspiring.

150
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.590
I did a little bit of like community service stuff and nothing where we've,

151
00:09:14.591 --> 00:09:18.900
you took me out of the equation.
Something bad happens in the world.
Like I just,

152
00:09:18.901 --> 00:09:22.680
I did the math and I was like,
cheese,
no wonder a little kid made me feel so bad.

153
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.090
I'm not having a big enough impact on the,

154
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:30.390
on the world with what I would argue is a pretty precious opportunity.

155
00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.310
Sounds depressing.
And I said,
but,
and this is unfair.

156
00:09:35.311 --> 00:09:37.320
So that exercise is unfair because I was,
I'm like,

157
00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:41.160
I'm 26 you're 36 you get a lot of years to go and maybe you're on the right path

158
00:09:41.161 --> 00:09:44.100
and you're going to have a huge impact.
Just haven't yet.
So did the,

159
00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:48.300
did the exercise again and said,
oh,
when I called it,
this is the impact map.

160
00:09:48.301 --> 00:09:51.000
I named this for you.
Okay.
So the next thing it's like,
all right,

161
00:09:51.001 --> 00:09:55.500
imagine I become much more senior in my role.
I get my boss's boss's boss's job.

162
00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:57.120
Then how much impact can I have?

163
00:09:57.121 --> 00:10:02.040
And I sort of went through it and these are personal judgements.

164
00:10:02.041 --> 00:10:05.190
So there,
there is no right answer here.
It's what you think is impactful.

165
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:09.060
I worked at a company whose primary KPI was the number of hours people spend on

166
00:10:09.061 --> 00:10:11.430
their bud watching television.
So I was like,

167
00:10:11.431 --> 00:10:14.580
even if I get to be a lot more important to this company,

168
00:10:14.581 --> 00:10:17.070
I don't know that I'm necessarily having the impact that I want to have on the

169
00:10:17.071 --> 00:10:18.940
world.
So I do my map

170
00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:23.940
and I thought through things that I could be doing and if I'm more senior,

171
00:10:23.941 --> 00:10:25.590
if I had more money,
if I had more time,

172
00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:28.920
but it sort of scoped it out and I started coming to this conclusion.
I was like,

173
00:10:28.921 --> 00:10:33.090
I don't know that I like the next 15 years that are laid up for me.

174
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:37.770
All right,
well this sucks and did it again.

175
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:42.240
I did a total zero based my life.
It was like you're smart young guy,

176
00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.680
you got plenty of time ahead of you.

177
00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:47.010
If you can do anything and presume for the second you can do anything,

178
00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.730
how much impact did I have?
And in this was a hard exercise.

179
00:10:50.731 --> 00:10:52.980
I literally at one point,
this is a true story.

180
00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:56.190
I literally called NASA and asked what you have to do to be an astronaut?

181
00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:59.310
And I got the time.
I was thinking like spaces so important.

182
00:10:59.311 --> 00:11:02.210
But there's so there's nobody out in front like really pushing new frontiers.

183
00:11:02.211 --> 00:11:05.430
It's,
but you have to be a pilot.
FYI.
If any of you,

184
00:11:05.431 --> 00:11:09.240
if this is on your list and as you sort of run the math,
you're like,
all right,

185
00:11:09.241 --> 00:11:10.530
like I could do that.

186
00:11:10.531 --> 00:11:13.980
But that might not be the shortest point between shortest distance between two

187
00:11:13.981 --> 00:11:14.814
points.

188
00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:20.330
This part of the exercise of his will reveal to you.

189
00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:26.400
I think whether or not you're currently executing a plan that is going to get

190
00:11:26.401 --> 00:11:30.360
you to a place where you can have a big impact with your life.
So there was,

191
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:33.180
there's you and what you're achieving,

192
00:11:33.181 --> 00:11:35.790
but I was achieving then what you might consider your achieving today.

193
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:40.170
Cause you a little bit more senior 10 years from now running the same playbook

194
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.710
and then there's blank space,
whatever.
You could do anything.

195
00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:47.910
Now here I'll pause to say on this third exercise you have to suspend disbelief.

196
00:11:47.911 --> 00:11:51.900
There's this thing that nags at all of us were like,
well I know I'm smart.

197
00:11:51.901 --> 00:11:54.610
I hope I did well in school,
but I mean,

198
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:58.390
I don't know that I could fill in the blank down to company,

199
00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:03.220
run a big company,
run for office,
write a book,
whatever your thing is.

200
00:12:03.221 --> 00:12:07.520
I don't know.
There are people who do that.
I'm not that person.
And I've,
I,

201
00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:10.390
I've had the pleasure of meeting all those people on the other side of it.

202
00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:12.730
They're no smarter than you.
They don't know anything that you don't know.

203
00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.850
There are two categories of people who have a job that you can't have,

204
00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:21.370
like super superstar musicians and super superstar athletes.

205
00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:23.350
I mean,
it was just like,
I'm just,
I just am not,

206
00:12:23.351 --> 00:12:27.970
I'm not big enough to be a linebacker for the giants.
So that one's out.
Uh,

207
00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:33.130
but if my life's dream was to work in baseball operations for the Yankees at a

208
00:12:33.131 --> 00:12:35.920
very senior level,
of course I,
or you or any of us could have that job.

209
00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:40.450
My life's dream was to run a nonprofit that has an impact on the developing

210
00:12:40.451 --> 00:12:41.830
world.
Of course,
any of us could have that trouble.

211
00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:47.260
So you have to suspend your disbelief and think about what you could be doing.

212
00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:51.640
I need you to ask yourself which one you like best.

213
00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:55.630
This exercise doesn't presuppose that the purpose of your life is to maximize

214
00:12:55.631 --> 00:12:56.500
your impact purpose.

215
00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:58.810
It's exercise to think about what it could be and then ask yourself what you

216
00:12:58.811 --> 00:13:03.670
like.
Someone who worked for me many years ago said to me in a review,
you know,

217
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:07.240
Mike,
I just,
I don't live to work.
I work to live.

218
00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:11.260
I don't think that's fair.
You're allowed to say that you're allowed to,

219
00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:16.180
you're allowed to choose the first chart.
It's a,
there's no judgments here,

220
00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:20.500
but you should know which one you want.
Don't say,
well,

221
00:13:20.501 --> 00:13:23.040
I don't really want all that when you really do because you're afraid to try.

222
00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:27.130
Nice.
That's exercise number one.
Completely unhelpful.

223
00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.320
All this does is force an existential crisis,

224
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:31.480
so hopefully some people are nodding their heads.

225
00:13:31.481 --> 00:13:34.060
Hopefully I've caused a couple of few existential crises.

226
00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:39.550
Then the second part of the exercise is where you start to define,
well,

227
00:13:39.551 --> 00:13:41.980
so what should I do about that?
Mike,

228
00:13:41.981 --> 00:13:44.260
the last thing you said is I can be anything from an astronaut to an

229
00:13:44.261 --> 00:13:48.070
entrepreneur to a,
to a politician.
So which one?

230
00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:53.730
And we think about,
uh,

231
00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:58.600
designing a product and the way that you design a product as you have certain

232
00:13:58.601 --> 00:14:01.120
things that the product has to do and certain things that you would like it to

233
00:14:01.121 --> 00:14:04.720
do and you work really hard to maximize all the things you'd like it to do and

234
00:14:04.721 --> 00:14:07.660
not sacrifice any of the things that it has to do.
All right,

235
00:14:07.661 --> 00:14:10.660
if we were designing an Ipod,
it's too late.
But if you were designing an Ipod,

236
00:14:10.661 --> 00:14:12.400
you'd say it has to play at least a thousand songs.

237
00:14:12.401 --> 00:14:15.580
It has to last at least 12 hours.
It has to fit in your pocket.

238
00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:16.990
Everything else is a bonus.

239
00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:20.140
And then you'd start trying to make the best product within those constraints.

240
00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:24.310
So now sort of opened up the,

241
00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:26.280
we've opened up the landscape,

242
00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:28.450
we've zero based how we think about our life now we'd start saying,
okay,

243
00:14:28.451 --> 00:14:33.040
well what I can do anything and have a big impact.
What do I want to do

244
00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:36.730
here?
I did a,
it was a very simple exercise.

245
00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.820
Make a list of things that you love to do,

246
00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:43.990
things that you hate to do and things that you can not live without.

247
00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:46.450
So on the last chart,

248
00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:50.650
I very well may have concluded that the most impactful thing I could do,

249
00:14:50.651 --> 00:14:55.280
I once studied the impact that you can have through nonprofits and one of the

250
00:14:55.340 --> 00:15:00.080
highest Roi,
the highest Roi you can get.
Nonprofit work.

251
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:04.250
The time I did the research is distributing a mosquito nets in the developing

252
00:15:04.251 --> 00:15:08.940
world.
The impact that it can have on malaria,
um,
and human health and is,
is,

253
00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:10.010
is significant.

254
00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:14.450
It doesn't mean that I necessarily have to make that my job next because when

255
00:15:14.451 --> 00:15:18.080
you make this list,
like I really hate travel and hot places and mosquitoes,

256
00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.870
so that one's just like,
might not be the right one for me.

257
00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:25.550
There was other stuff on the list that can be really impactful that I can do

258
00:15:25.551 --> 00:15:27.850
that I also can really enjoy.

259
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.110
So what do you hate doing?
Like I,
you know,
in,
in this,

260
00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.130
these things change at different parts of your life.

261
00:15:34.131 --> 00:15:38.090
I have two young kids and there are jobs out there that are just 220 days a year

262
00:15:38.091 --> 00:15:39.860
on an airplane or a hotel like I won't do it.

263
00:15:39.861 --> 00:15:43.970
That's a design constraint on my life.
Travel some during the quarter,

264
00:15:43.971 --> 00:15:45.980
but it can't.
I can't live on the road.

265
00:15:45.981 --> 00:15:50.450
I'll miss what's going on at home.
It's a personal choice.

266
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:55.010
You fill this whole thing in and you have to do it.
Really honestly,

267
00:15:55.011 --> 00:15:57.290
you have to be honest with yourself,

268
00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:02.150
and I'll use one example where we never are,
and again,

269
00:16:02.151 --> 00:16:06.200
another really personal question,
but it's money.

270
00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:10.370
How much money do you need to be happy?
Well,

271
00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:12.890
we've all been trained to answer that question,
right?

272
00:16:12.891 --> 00:16:16.790
We've been trained by Shel Silverstein poems that what you're supposed to say is

273
00:16:16.791 --> 00:16:20.900
the money doesn't matter.
You've money cannot buy happiness.

274
00:16:20.901 --> 00:16:24.370
I don't care about money.
All right,

275
00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:29.900
you were living in sixth floor studio,
welcome,
but two kids.
It's hard.

276
00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:35.890
There are tradeoffs and there are considerations that we have to make an all of

277
00:16:35.901 --> 00:16:39.890
these things.
So take this one.
Let's use this example.

278
00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:44.660
How much money to someone new because he get tricked on both ends.

279
00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:48.500
What happens is there will be a day,

280
00:16:48.501 --> 00:16:50.900
a moment where you have an opportunity to choose among jobs.

281
00:16:50.901 --> 00:16:54.740
They may be within your company or they may be outside of your company and

282
00:16:54.741 --> 00:16:55.730
here's how they always look.

283
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:59.060
There's this thing that you know you want to be doing and it's really cool.

284
00:16:59.061 --> 00:17:01.010
It doesn't pay as much,
but you can live,
it's fine,

285
00:17:01.011 --> 00:17:04.250
you can live on it and there's this other thing and then they keep raising the

286
00:17:04.251 --> 00:17:07.130
temperature and offering you more and more and more money not to do the thing

287
00:17:07.131 --> 00:17:10.820
you really want to do.
It's a real choice.

288
00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.030
Everyone does the same thing.
Everyone takes the money,

289
00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:17.240
but we never ever say no one ever says,

290
00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:20.450
I'm going to sacrifice my dream to take the money.

291
00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:24.590
Our brains are too good at self justification.
We never ever do that.

292
00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.180
When we say is,

293
00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:31.480
I'll take the money now and then in two or three years I can do anything I want.

294
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:40.400
Here's what happens.
Whatever money you make you spend,
trust me.

295
00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:44.150
Whatever money you make you spend.
So if someone says to you,
Hey,

296
00:17:44.151 --> 00:17:46.820
come take a job that is inconsistent with the impact you want to have.

297
00:17:46.821 --> 00:17:49.260
It's inconsistent with the things you enjoy,
but we'll pay you a ton of money.

298
00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:54.120
What will happen is you will spend it and then you will not only be unhappy,

299
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:57.840
you'll have even less flexibility in your life because now you have a house in

300
00:17:57.841 --> 00:18:02.160
Montauk,
which is great.

301
00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:07.340
You used to have a job you liked and you read it a place in [inaudible].

302
00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:10.590
Now I have a job you hate and you own a house in Montauk and you have to keep

303
00:18:10.591 --> 00:18:11.424
the job.

304
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:17.130
These personal sort of design constraints and design considerations,

305
00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.610
you have to really like fight with yourself and wrestle with each and every one

306
00:18:20.611 --> 00:18:24.790
of them
and then you start to come to a picture.
You've,

307
00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.690
you started to outline some things that could be impactful that you'd really

308
00:18:27.691 --> 00:18:28.081
love to do.

309
00:18:28.081 --> 00:18:33.081
You start to outline things that you would enjoy and things that you would not

310
00:18:33.931 --> 00:18:38.280
enjoy and you start to get a sense for something like what you'd want to do at

311
00:18:38.281 --> 00:18:39.510
this stage of the exercise.

312
00:18:39.511 --> 00:18:43.860
I could probably say I love working with great people and leading great people.

313
00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:49.050
I love working in a technology related sector and I love that.

314
00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:52.830
I love to have work that impact lots and lots and lots of users and a positive

315
00:18:52.831 --> 00:18:55.530
way that's vague.
Like I you can't next,

316
00:18:55.531 --> 00:18:58.620
you can't add a objective to your resume based on that.
But I get closer.

317
00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:02.760
Next exercise.
Oh,

318
00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:06.450
and the last part of that is I take Steph Landon this point,

319
00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.140
look at the credit card statements,
look at how much money we spend every month,

320
00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:12.930
add up how much private schools cost and the mortgage it does at that.

321
00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.380
And it adds up to this much money.
And I'm like,
okay,
that's,
I need that.

322
00:19:15.381 --> 00:19:18.060
I got to make that much money at any amount of money over that.
Forget it.

323
00:19:18.061 --> 00:19:22.140
I won't,
I literally don't care.
I am not going to chase more.

324
00:19:22.141 --> 00:19:25.950
I just need to hit,
I need to hit a certain bid.
Cause if I donate this bid,

325
00:19:25.951 --> 00:19:29.040
the next best school in our district after the private school has a metal

326
00:19:29.041 --> 00:19:33.120
detector.
So I'm going to be right.
I'm going to Atlanta right there.
All right,

327
00:19:33.121 --> 00:19:35.970
so then we're narrowing the field.

328
00:19:35.971 --> 00:19:37.710
We're designing this product that is your life,

329
00:19:37.711 --> 00:19:42.510
so now I'm just going to filter the results.
Geography,
function,
industry,

330
00:19:42.511 --> 00:19:46.470
company size.
Where do I want to live?
There were essentially two choices,

331
00:19:46.471 --> 00:19:49.860
New York or someplace else.
For me,

332
00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:53.250
it depends on what is important for you,

333
00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:55.530
but there was a period of my life where I didn't,

334
00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.020
I didn't internalize this and some would call and say,

335
00:19:58.021 --> 00:20:02.190
we've got this awesome job for you running six countries in Europe

336
00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:07.980
and I am not a Europe guy.
You guys,
you know me,

337
00:20:07.981 --> 00:20:10.980
like I'm not supposed to be there.
But you go through this crazy like,
oh,

338
00:20:10.981 --> 00:20:14.430
maybe I should go to Europe and I can sell widgets to French people and things

339
00:20:14.431 --> 00:20:17.190
will be great.
And then thinking of the career I could have,

340
00:20:17.191 --> 00:20:21.090
because I can put global experience on my resume when I leave New York to go on

341
00:20:21.091 --> 00:20:23.670
vacation,
I'm sad I can't wait to get home.
I love New York.

342
00:20:23.671 --> 00:20:26.520
That's my design constraint.
I have friends.

343
00:20:26.521 --> 00:20:29.130
You feel that way about Chicago who feel the way about California?
Who,

344
00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:31.860
who will not mess with Texas.
That's up to you.

345
00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:34.710
Other people do not have this constraint.
I means you can do way more.

346
00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:38.490
I have friends who will pick up stakes and go anytime you have to know the

347
00:20:38.491 --> 00:20:42.780
answer for you and the job shouldn't decide that you should decide that and then

348
00:20:42.781 --> 00:20:45.450
filter the jobs before they interrupt your day.

349
00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:50.980
Next is function.
Should you do,
and this is,

350
00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.060
you know a lot of us,

351
00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:55.270
you sorta take a job coming out of business school or something and that's your

352
00:20:55.271 --> 00:20:57.910
function and in years at the,
it does in the function.

353
00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:01.780
You all work at a great company that it's this let you switch a lot of places

354
00:21:01.781 --> 00:21:05.200
it's harder.
There are basically three functions in any company.

355
00:21:05.201 --> 00:21:08.040
We make it so difficult like we we,
we make it sound difficult.

356
00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:11.620
You can either make this stuff or you can sell the stuff or you get support.

357
00:21:11.621 --> 00:21:13.000
The people who make the stuff or sell to stuff,

358
00:21:13.001 --> 00:21:15.550
those are basically the three jobs.
So which one are you going to do?

359
00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.640
You gonna make it,
are you going to sell it?
Are you going to support?

360
00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:21.160
And then is that marketing,
is that finance?
Is that legal?

361
00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:23.650
You don't have to stay in the function forever,

362
00:21:23.651 --> 00:21:27.790
but it's really healthy once you start to now the field and say I enjoy blank,

363
00:21:27.791 --> 00:21:28.624
I enjoy design,

364
00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:33.760
I enjoyed sales and if you have a hard time with it,
it's hard to say.

365
00:21:33.761 --> 00:21:36.670
It's especially hard to say when you're in the job cause whatever job you're in

366
00:21:36.671 --> 00:21:40.690
kind of sucks today and that's life because the job you're in today comes with

367
00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:45.220
email and meetings and a forum you have to fill out and an angry customer like

368
00:21:45.221 --> 00:21:49.120
it's just,
it always looks better to be in someone else's job.

369
00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:53.740
So you ask yourself what are the things that like stir my animal spirits

370
00:21:53.741 --> 00:21:57.310
wouldn't.
When am I,
what am I most psyched at work?

371
00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:00.190
Is it when you are organizing this stuff,

372
00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.670
there are people who get endorphins when they are in spreadsheets.

373
00:22:03.671 --> 00:22:06.100
Taking chaos and turning that chaos into order,

374
00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:09.130
giving that order back to the team and helping that team to run better.

375
00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:13.750
That feels good.
And have you ever seen the sweat away?

376
00:22:13.751 --> 00:22:17.320
The sweaters are lined up in my closet.
It is like is the closet of a psychopath.

377
00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:23.230
I love when the comp plan matches the behaviors you want for the team.

378
00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:26.470
That is fun for me.
That is a thing that like I get endorphins from that.

379
00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:27.641
Other people,

380
00:22:27.641 --> 00:22:31.220
they just see the like let a Google spreadsheet has been open on their computer

381
00:22:31.221 --> 00:22:34.990
and like Ah,
they,
they don't want to do it.
Some people,

382
00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:39.490
the thought of going on a sales call and convincing someone to take something

383
00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:42.340
that you want to give them makes them want to throw up.

384
00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:48.340
Some of us walk out of a meeting where we've influenced someone and we're

385
00:22:48.341 --> 00:22:52.750
completely energized by it.
So what are those things at work it's not,

386
00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:56.140
do I love the job that I currently have in finance and I love the job I

387
00:22:56.141 --> 00:23:00.490
currently have in sales,
but now like every day it sucks in one way or another.

388
00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:05.260
But what is the essence of the thing that I love doing?
Leading,

389
00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:09.730
influencing others,
organizing the world,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

390
00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:14.290
Then helps to narrow down the functions.
Then you can ask industry.

391
00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.510
Some people have a strong opinion on this.
You probably should pick.

392
00:23:16.511 --> 00:23:18.190
It gets harder and harder to switch over time.

393
00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:21.160
You guys all picked a pretty good one.
I mean it's skip this.

394
00:23:21.161 --> 00:23:24.070
You work in a good industry and you could switch to food services.

395
00:23:24.071 --> 00:23:26.450
We have a passion for it,
but this like,
I think you're right,

396
00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:31.210
like you're on the right path and then Lazarus sort of company size and company

397
00:23:31.211 --> 00:23:36.211
stage and a mistake that many people who work at big,

398
00:23:36.251 --> 00:23:40.000
successful companies make is that your lens for the world starts to become big

399
00:23:40.001 --> 00:23:44.170
successful companies.
When I worked at Google,
it was a while ago,

400
00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:46.640
there were only three jobs.
It was Google,

401
00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:49.430
Facebook and whatever was the other hot company people were talking about.

402
00:23:49.431 --> 00:23:52.220
That's going to become the next Google or Facebook.
That's all we talked about.

403
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:58.330
There is this enormous range of companies of different sizes and different

404
00:23:58.401 --> 00:24:00.290
stages at which one could work.

405
00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:03.710
Now the more enlightened among us thought that there was Google,
Facebook,

406
00:24:03.711 --> 00:24:03.981
the place,

407
00:24:03.981 --> 00:24:06.920
it could be the next Google or Facebook and some startup that called and said

408
00:24:06.921 --> 00:24:11.921
there was a fourth in between our companies with a market cap between $200

409
00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:16.370
million and $20 billion that need really good people.

410
00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:18.920
And you know,
I've had friends who were like,

411
00:24:18.921 --> 00:24:21.640
what I really want to do is just run a big function and I'm like,

412
00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:24.020
you work at a this one or another one,

413
00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:27.050
a really big company where someone might not give you a really big function,

414
00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:32.690
but there's another company with a thousand employees,
5,000 employees,

415
00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:35.990
but the sun would rise and set on someone with your talents.

416
00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:41.430
This is an important consideration and it's one that many of us miss because I

417
00:24:41.931 --> 00:24:46.931
don't know anyone here ever think about working in like open table or grub hub

418
00:24:47.571 --> 00:24:49.440
or TripAdvisor or homeaway.

419
00:24:49.441 --> 00:24:52.400
I mean these are companies with market caps of like a billion,
2 billion,

420
00:24:52.401 --> 00:24:57.140
$3 billion or so small like Google deltas,
$3 billion.

421
00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:01.820
Sort of a work at a company with a whole thing is worth that.
It's like,
Oh God,

422
00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:06.200
that's a really cool companies that deliver really cool services that could

423
00:25:06.201 --> 00:25:09.020
really use great people.
I'm not going to be clear,

424
00:25:09.021 --> 00:25:11.030
I'm not asking anybody here to go take a job like that,

425
00:25:11.031 --> 00:25:14.510
but I'm just saying that there's a range of company sizes and whatever company

426
00:25:14.511 --> 00:25:17.530
you work at,
you tend not to see the other ones you ever like.
Start up.

427
00:25:17.531 --> 00:25:19.910
People are their startup people.
Like all my startups getting too big.

428
00:25:19.911 --> 00:25:20.840
I need a new startup.
Okay,

429
00:25:20.841 --> 00:25:24.440
as long as that's not because you know where you sit is where you stand.

430
00:25:24.441 --> 00:25:27.740
You just have started to form this bias.
If you really love it,

431
00:25:27.741 --> 00:25:31.010
then that's the right thing for you and then their stage.

432
00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:36.140
Continuing excellence is the stage of many large companies that can be fun.

433
00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:38.270
Turnaround can be a lot of fun.

434
00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:41.660
It takes somebody who's broken company and fix it.
Startup can be a lot of fun.

435
00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:44.600
You change the paper in the copier.
It's up to you.

436
00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:49.100
You got to decide what you like doing.
I have friends in the harvest business.

437
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:53.030
Everyone is no fun.
They're like,
okay.
The investors think the business.

438
00:25:53.031 --> 00:25:55.700
The last five more years.
If we can make it last eight we'll make a lot of money.

439
00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:58.520
Well,
but that's a job.
It's an honorable job.

440
00:25:58.521 --> 00:26:01.250
It helps me to keep the economy moving.
You've got to make your own decisions.

441
00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:06.500
So do that exercise.
You start to narrow down,
right?

442
00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:09.410
What are the things that could have impact?
How can I be important to the world?

443
00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.000
How important do I want to be?

444
00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:16.040
What are the things that I enjoy or don't enjoy or things that I need to be

445
00:26:16.041 --> 00:26:20.330
happy.
And then as I'm picking among career choices,

446
00:26:20.331 --> 00:26:22.700
which are the ones that feel right to me and you start to narrow the field.

447
00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:28.070
So I overtime I was able to narrow the field down to I really like tech.

448
00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:30.500
I want a smaller company,
but one with,
uh,

449
00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:32.780
you know who that is an opportunity to have real impact.

450
00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:34.350
I want something to see that,
that,
that,

451
00:26:34.351 --> 00:26:38.300
that I think we can really grow and I want to be in a significant leadership

452
00:26:38.301 --> 00:26:42.860
position like my then,
then you can wait for your pitch and you know when to,

453
00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:46.320
because you've got a good sense for that thing that you're looking for.

454
00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:49.830
Um,
if you look at the,

455
00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:55.080
if you look at the careers of people who've been successful,

456
00:26:55.081 --> 00:26:57.620
when people who haven't,
generally speaking,

457
00:26:57.621 --> 00:26:59.780
the people who've been successful have known what they're looking for and they

458
00:26:59.781 --> 00:27:03.030
have a plan.
The people who haven't,

459
00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:08.040
people who've done okay tend to have a career path that has a lot of variety or

460
00:27:08.201 --> 00:27:09.430
no variety,
right?

461
00:27:09.431 --> 00:27:13.360
They like stay in one job in one function and just wait to be elevated.

462
00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:18.460
Or they keep changing to try new things,
but you don't see a plan.

463
00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:25.470
And so the next part I would suggest is once you've got a sense for what you

464
00:27:26.381 --> 00:27:27.214
want to do,

465
00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:34.290
you then come to grips with the brutal facts that you are unqualified for that

466
00:27:35.141 --> 00:27:40.141
thing that you want completely unqualified to do it today.

467
00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:46.710
But you have the ability and the right to expect to be in that position in some

468
00:27:48.611 --> 00:27:53.611
period of time and then from here to there you have to make a plan the way you

469
00:27:54.551 --> 00:27:58.540
make a plan.
Here's one way you can do it.
Think of the job that you really want.

470
00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:02.190
If mine,
if mine got really specific,
I say I want to be a,

471
00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:04.030
I want to be a senior executive,

472
00:28:04.031 --> 00:28:07.930
a c level executive in the tech space with consumer facing products.

473
00:28:07.931 --> 00:28:08.920
Let's say I pick that one.

474
00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:14.920
There are bio's of senior executives in the tech space available on every one of

475
00:28:14.921 --> 00:28:19.180
those companies' websites.
Read them what?
What experiences did they have?

476
00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:23.050
Meet with people who have these jobs.
Ask them,

477
00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:25.450
what do you have to be good at in your job?

478
00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:31.220
You'd be amazed at who is willing to talk to you.
Then you say,
okay,

479
00:28:31.221 --> 00:28:34.400
those are experiences I need.
Those are things I need to be good at.

480
00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:39.270
How do I get it?
Some of them are easy.
You need to know how to manage a PNL.

481
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:43.430
You need to know how to read the numbers for the job.
I just described.

482
00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:46.640
I got this,
my wife was a beggar.
She gave me a book.

483
00:28:46.641 --> 00:28:49.550
It was like this thick and it was on accounting and finance and I've read this

484
00:28:49.551 --> 00:28:52.220
horrible book.
I'd rather eat that book,
then read it again.

485
00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:56.660
But then I knew you know what to debit and what the credit and the difference

486
00:28:56.661 --> 00:28:59.750
between Ebit and Ebitda and all these things that are so confusing to someone

487
00:28:59.751 --> 00:29:02.180
who hasn't read the book.
I read the book,
you basically get it.

488
00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:06.350
There are other things that reading the book health,
so you really have to do it.

489
00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:10.430
Managing a large team.
Anyone who has the big a big job,

490
00:29:10.431 --> 00:29:14.330
like the one I described manages a large team at the time that I did this impact

491
00:29:14.331 --> 00:29:18.590
map exercise.
Uh,
I manage a team of one intern.
His name was Felix.

492
00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:23.750
I was not qualified to manage managers and a large team and organization.

493
00:29:23.751 --> 00:29:25.340
Tell me about your leadership experience like,
well,

494
00:29:25.341 --> 00:29:29.210
one time Felix wasn't doing what he should and I said,

495
00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:32.720
Felix,
I really need you to do something different,

496
00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:39.050
but what you can do with any of these capabilities as you can disambiguate you,

497
00:29:39.051 --> 00:29:41.740
break it down into its atomic parts,
right,
and okay,
what does,

498
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:46.630
what does leading a large team entail?
Being able to hire good people.

499
00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:49.570
Okay.
Break that down further because if you don't have a team,

500
00:29:49.571 --> 00:29:50.410
you're not allowed to hire.

501
00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:54.790
Knowing how to identify how to recruit and identify good,
good talent.
Okay?

502
00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:57.280
Anyone here can participate in that?

503
00:29:57.370 --> 00:30:01.900
If you are an individual contributor on a team that hires from time to time,

504
00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:05.530
ask your manager if you can help be a part of the interview process.

505
00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:08.800
Tell your manager,
I've just read two books on the topic.
Read the books.

506
00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:12.190
I think I've developed some expertise on interviewing.

507
00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:14.770
Can I please interview a candidate and give you my notes on the person and

508
00:30:14.771 --> 00:30:17.980
compare with you.
Don't take you very little bit of time.

509
00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:21.280
Now you're becoming someone who's developing expertise in interviewing.

510
00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:26.980
Next,
you get a Felix and you manage that.
Felix.

511
00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:27.993
Well,

512
00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:33.250
you make breakdown other elements of a leader's position being a good

513
00:30:33.251 --> 00:30:34.060
communicator.

514
00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:36.670
There are books on this and there are opportunities for you to demonstrate this

515
00:30:36.671 --> 00:30:38.350
at work.
You practice these things.

516
00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.320
The worst thing that could ever happen is you get the job of your dreams and

517
00:30:41.321 --> 00:30:45.670
you're just,
and you just never put in the effort to become good at those things.

518
00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:51.190
You swing and miss when you finally get the chance.
So that's career roadmap.

519
00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:57.430
You break the job that you'd like to have ultimately in your life down into the

520
00:30:57.431 --> 00:30:59.620
things that you have to be good at and the experiences you need.

521
00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:05.290
And you go and you get them,
you go develop those experiences.

522
00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:08.920
Sometimes the books you're mentoring,
your practice,
your side hustle.

523
00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:12.820
It's up to you.
Don't we on time?

524
00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:16.900
Do we have any time left?
I think we do,

525
00:31:16.901 --> 00:31:20.360
but what I want when I want to do is the next part is a little different.

526
00:31:20.361 --> 00:31:24.100
So I'm gonna pause there and take questions.
Was a question.

527
00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:29.560
Is this helpful,
useful?
There's a question.

528
00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:33.850
<v 2>How often do you find that people are just,
he please use the microphone?
No,</v>

529
00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:36.630
it's okay.
I'll just repeat the question.
If you say,
uh,

530
00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:39.810
how often do you find that people are just always striving for the grass,

531
00:31:39.811 --> 00:31:40.780
always being greener,

532
00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:45.060
seeing something better than what they currently have when it turns out they're

533
00:31:45.061 --> 00:31:49.200
just looking for something else different as opposed to this specific thing.

534
00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:52.640
<v 0>How often do you find that someone is just looking for the next thing and the</v>

535
00:31:52.641 --> 00:31:55.280
grass is always greener rather than looking for the right thing?
Always.

536
00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:56.810
All the time.
All the time.

537
00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:01.840
It's a great question and it's why having a purpose and a plan is so important

538
00:32:02.661 --> 00:32:06.060
to your success and I want to,
if I cannot wait,

539
00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:10.070
I want to sort of break that question down into two parts because one is just

540
00:32:10.071 --> 00:32:13.630
vague.
Dissatisfaction as a,
as a driver of a career,

541
00:32:13.631 --> 00:32:15.800
it is not necessarily going to get you to the right place.

542
00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:18.140
You don't know where you're at is obvious,
right?

543
00:32:18.141 --> 00:32:20.630
But he don't know where you're going.
The faster you run in that direction,

544
00:32:20.631 --> 00:32:21.464
the more likely you are to

545
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:23.543
<v 1>Mr.</v>

546
00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:29.510
<v 0>The second component of that question.
So have a plan.
So part of the answers,</v>

547
00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:32.260
if you have a plan and you're jamming to achieve that plan,

548
00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:35.500
you're on the right path.
Second part of the question is

549
00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:39.950
you might have acid or I might say,

550
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:43.100
<v 2>Hey,
I'm really ambitious so I'm always miserable because other people are more</v>

551
00:32:43.101 --> 00:32:44.570
senior than me or more successful.

552
00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:47.810
Have you ever feel that somebody's ever like leave your team or leave the

553
00:32:47.811 --> 00:32:50.020
company and go somewhere else and get a better job and better titling?

554
00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:54.200
You're like,
ah,
that person please.

555
00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:58.760
The guy is terrible.

556
00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:05.420
Like there's someplace you want to be and an other people seem to be someplace

557
00:33:05.421 --> 00:33:09.710
else and you're not and it makes you like,
ah,
crazy.

558
00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:14.060
So
that's not healthy either.
Right?

559
00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:16.790
Not being ambitious is not healthy.
Not having a plan is not healthy,

560
00:33:16.791 --> 00:33:19.310
but then always being miserable because you want to be somewhere else.

561
00:33:19.311 --> 00:33:24.080
It's not healthy to.
So
as you think about it,

562
00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:29.270
here's a good exercise to do.
Imagine the sum of all of your dreams,

563
00:33:29.271 --> 00:33:30.104
astronaut,

564
00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:35.260
like whatever it is you want to be CEO of.

565
00:33:35.361 --> 00:33:39.260
Pick a company or you want to run such and such.
Just pick it.

566
00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:42.380
And if you wanted a ton of money,
give yourself 100 million bucks,

567
00:33:42.381 --> 00:33:46.760
put it all in a pile,
put it on a pile on a plate and I will give it to you.

568
00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:49.400
It's a trade that you have to make.
I will trade you something.

569
00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:54.290
I will give you all the things you want and all you have to give me back is

570
00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:58.410
<v 0>the health of someone important to you.</v>

571
00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:00.220
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

572
00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:03.460
<v 0>Or your site or your limbs,</v>

573
00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:06.370
your relationship with your parents.

574
00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:13.150
Very few people would make that trade,
which means you currently have this,

575
00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:14.540
a mathematic,
mathematically true.

576
00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:18.860
You currently have more value than all the things to which you aspire.

577
00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:22.340
We have right now is worth more than all of the things that you want.

578
00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:24.500
So it would be criminal.

579
00:34:24.501 --> 00:34:29.030
It'd be horrible to have all of that and be miserable all the time because

580
00:34:29.031 --> 00:34:31.280
somebody else got a raise.
You didn't know a promotion,
you didn't.

581
00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:36.230
It'd be awful to go to set yourself off on this journey to have impact,

582
00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:39.860
but all along the way to be miserable because you haven't had the impact yet.

583
00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:43.820
So I don't know the balance.
The trick and it's hard to do.

584
00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:49.290
It's to enjoy today and be gentle and be driving for greater impact that you

585
00:34:49.431 --> 00:34:52.940
want to have in the future.
A great way to do that.

586
00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:56.900
One man's opinion,
take it for what it's worth,
is just don't multitask.

587
00:34:57.410 --> 00:35:00.830
If you're with your friends,
turn off your phone,
right?
Like yes,

588
00:35:00.831 --> 00:35:02.810
there's interesting stuff going on on your phone,
but there's more,

589
00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:04.310
there's interesting stuff going on with your friends too,

590
00:35:04.311 --> 00:35:08.760
and if you're half on the phone,
you missed the whole thing.
Yes,

591
00:35:08.761 --> 00:35:11.460
someone else got promoted or something's going on at work and stressing you out,

592
00:35:11.461 --> 00:35:12.840
but be in the moment that you're in now.

593
00:35:12.841 --> 00:35:15.260
Don't be stressing out about some stuff going on over there.
That's a,

594
00:35:15.261 --> 00:35:18.030
that's a balance and it's a balance.
It's a,
it's a great question though.

595
00:35:18.031 --> 00:35:20.010
Thank you.
Other questions in the back?

596
00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:23.190
<v 2>So as you're going through these exercises,</v>

597
00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:29.070
identifying what you need in order to set up the filters to build a plan,
what,

598
00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:32.640
how do you,
or what recommendations do you have for someone that says,

599
00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:35.270
I don't know.
I don't know what I would,

600
00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:38.220
<v 0>the question is if you're going through all this and don't know what should you</v>

601
00:35:38.221 --> 00:35:42.480
do,
this is the tyranny of choice,
right?

602
00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:46.310
This is what's so hard.
There was some experiment where they um,

603
00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:48.720
psychologist gave,

604
00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:52.620
they brought a group people instead they get to have a free pair of jeans and

605
00:35:52.621 --> 00:35:55.800
they said to the one group,
they're like,
just pick a pair of jeans.

606
00:35:55.801 --> 00:35:58.920
They had three genes.
It's like tidy genes and regular jeans and baggy jeans and

607
00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:02.340
everyone under 30 I guess took the tidy genius.

608
00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:04.920
They had another group come in and they were like,

609
00:36:04.921 --> 00:36:08.040
we have 60 different kinds of genes at every different kind of you want.

610
00:36:08.041 --> 00:36:10.260
And later they ask people how happy they were with them and the people who had

611
00:36:10.261 --> 00:36:13.810
fewer choices were happier.
People,
had more choices,

612
00:36:13.811 --> 00:36:16.440
had all this like regret over whether or not they took the right ones.

613
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:20.340
So if your question is do you go through this whole exercise and you're just

614
00:36:20.341 --> 00:36:22.680
paralyzed by the choice,
paralyzed,

615
00:36:24.690 --> 00:36:28.590
give yourself a deadline and give yourself a method.
All right.

616
00:36:28.591 --> 00:36:32.130
I did a thing where I woke up every morning at 5:00 AM and I would write,

617
00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:36.810
I would write and write and write.
I wrote a bucket list.
I wrote a eulogy.

618
00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:40.980
I wrote the book report that I would want my granddaughter to write about me

619
00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:44.040
some 50 years from now.
Right,
right,
right.

620
00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:47.210
All these things that I want to be true like style.
You know what?

621
00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:52.110
What do you want it to say in your eulogy?
Like Steve Leaves us at 125 years old.

622
00:36:52.111 --> 00:36:57.090
He still has all of his hair and he's 90 wonderful,
great,
great grandchildren.

623
00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:02.070
Whatever your thing is,
like what?
What are those things that are important?

624
00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:04.260
The more you go through that exercise,
the more clarity it gives you,

625
00:37:04.261 --> 00:37:09.000
and I can't emphasize this enough.
Writing is really powerful,
not typing,
writing.

626
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:14.270
It just seems to touch a different part of your brain and that exercise.

627
00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:17.670
Exercise starts to bring you clarity and then wander the earth.

628
00:37:17.671 --> 00:37:20.130
Tell you something.
I'm going to go talk to these 10 people who have careers,

629
00:37:20.131 --> 00:37:21.660
different kinds of careers that they seem to enjoy it.

630
00:37:21.661 --> 00:37:24.720
I'm just going to ask them,
how'd you do it?
What was interesting?

631
00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:28.470
What did you like do that exercise.

632
00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:34.350
If you still don't know what to do,
that means you're indifferent.

633
00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:39.030
Pick one,
pick one and stick with it and just go for pick one.

634
00:37:39.031 --> 00:37:40.470
That's like an honestly,

635
00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:45.500
there is no perfect answer for you unless you are Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,

636
00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:52.130
you are supposed to play piano like 99 point 900900900 9% of us are not supposed

637
00:37:52.351 --> 00:37:55.170
to do anything,
so pick one.

638
00:37:56.250 --> 00:37:59.310
I have a friend who's an author and I sent him,
I was like,
ah,

639
00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:01.110
this is a couple of years ago,
so it gets us so great.

640
00:38:01.111 --> 00:38:05.550
You wrote a book like you're a writer,
how did you know you are a writer?
And he,

641
00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:07.650
he was like,
this is stupidest question I've ever heard.

642
00:38:07.651 --> 00:38:10.660
You're a writer after you write a book so you don't know you're a writer and
see,

643
00:38:10.661 --> 00:38:14.160
write a book.
Then you were right or I'm like,
no,
but like a real writer.

644
00:38:14.161 --> 00:38:17.460
He's like,
they don't do that.
They don't split them into categories.

645
00:38:17.461 --> 00:38:19.320
There's just the writer.

646
00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:25.530
So if you can't pick,
I don't know,
even my,
I put my email before,
just email me.

647
00:38:25.531 --> 00:38:26.364
I'll,
I'll give you some.

648
00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:33.510
<v 2>So
never</v>

649
00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:36.670
things change,

650
00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:41.940
opportunities come up and are too busy planning or you're this what,

651
00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:43.960
what's your perspective?

652
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.140
<v 0>The question if you didn't hear it was um,</v>

653
00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:51.630
I think the opposite of everything you just said
that,

654
00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:54.420
what was your name?
Matt?
So Matt said,

655
00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:56.910
I've gotten advice that you shouldn't try to over engineer your career cause you

656
00:38:56.911 --> 00:39:00.680
could miss something.
It's very good advice,
but I would,
uh,

657
00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:02.100
but I might express it differently.

658
00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:06.270
You should be iterating this plan regularly.

659
00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:09.390
You should regularly be asking yourself what kind of impact do I want to have?

660
00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:13.740
What kind of a career road,
what career road mapped I want to execute.

661
00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:16.890
As you're in the field,
as you're doing and learning,

662
00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:21.030
you should be iterating that plan.
There's,
you know,

663
00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:24.780
there was some moment when a bunch of people who really wanted to work in media

664
00:39:25.890 --> 00:39:28.170
defined it as television and missed Internet,

665
00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:31.920
did not reboot their career plan for,

666
00:39:31.921 --> 00:39:34.410
maybe I'll do something in the internet much to the

667
00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:37.350
much to their dismay.

668
00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:41.520
So I would say you should have a plan and you should engineer it,

669
00:39:41.521 --> 00:39:44.580
but you should in the same way that we develop products and put them in front of

670
00:39:44.581 --> 00:39:45.414
our users,

671
00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:50.340
you should launch early and often I should learn from the experience,

672
00:39:50.341 --> 00:39:52.530
we should iterate to the next,
the next level of the product.

673
00:39:52.531 --> 00:39:54.750
And I think that gives you the best of both.
It gives you a plan.

674
00:39:54.751 --> 00:39:59.751
You're not just wandering in the wilderness and it allows you to take new data

675
00:40:00.271 --> 00:40:03.810
points and incorporate them into that plan.
That would be,
that'd be my advice.

676
00:40:03.811 --> 00:40:07.700
But every,
everybody's got a,
um,
everybody's gotta do their own thing.
The,

677
00:40:07.701 --> 00:40:12.210
the chairman of Linkedin wrote a book,
uh,
which is very good.
It's very popular.

678
00:40:12.211 --> 00:40:14.670
And it basically just says,
hang out with really smart,

679
00:40:14.671 --> 00:40:17.660
interesting people and some good shit will happen.
And that's a like,

680
00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:18.720
and he has a lot more money than me.

681
00:40:18.721 --> 00:40:21.990
So you gotta so you pick like there are there,
there,

682
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.430
there are different ways to execute it.

683
00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:28.320
My humble advice would be have a plan and consistently edit that plan and

684
00:40:28.321 --> 00:40:29.670
iterate that plan as you learn more.

685
00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:35.860
<v 2>Nick's,
so,
uh,
um,
some of this sometimes,</v>

686
00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:40.430
and I think you were alluding to,
it's in games,
big fish,
small pond,
small fish,

687
00:40:40.431 --> 00:40:42.690
big pond,
sort of,
uh,

688
00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:48.860
sort of general happiness too.
Is there,
is there a preference to you Peter,

689
00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:52.370
and then do you think there's a core small pilot environment?

690
00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:58.760
<v 0>Elliot asked what's better to be a big fish in a small pond or a small fish in a</v>

691
00:40:58.761 --> 00:41:03.761
big pond and it is completely dependent upon what you enjoy?

692
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.500
Um,
big fish,
small pond
as my job now,

693
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:14.790
my,
my,
my company has 800 employees.
Um,

694
00:41:15.110 --> 00:41:16.670
I make a decision and we do it.

695
00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:20.830
And actually I remember when I first took the job,
um,
I said to my CFO,

696
00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:23.600
there was a company we wanted to buy it.
I was like,
okay,
like,
you know,

697
00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:26.210
I was like,
what was winter?
Like?
Who,
who do we have to talk to now?

698
00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:29.390
And she was like,
nobody,
you're the CEO,
you just buy it.

699
00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:32.623
Whoa.

700
00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:37.500
I guess this is what I signed up for at the same time.
And the job,
you know,

701
00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:39.590
I had a job I had had previously.

702
00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:42.770
The only way to get anything done was to build coalitions and get everybody on

703
00:41:42.771 --> 00:41:44.330
the same page and manage stakeholders.

704
00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:46.790
Some people are really good at one of those.
Some people are good at the other,

705
00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:50.120
some enjoy one,
some enjoy the other.
That's for me,

706
00:41:50.121 --> 00:41:52.760
that's essentially what determines,
um,

707
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:57.140
bigger company versus a bigger company versus a smaller company.
I'd also,

708
00:41:57.141 --> 00:42:01.340
I would just call,
I'd also comment that it's a false choice because,
you know,

709
00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:03.470
there are people,
I mean this is a big company,
right?

710
00:42:03.471 --> 00:42:06.440
But there's a small group working on the Google space elevator or whatever you

711
00:42:06.441 --> 00:42:09.560
guys are up to that I'm sure it doesn't feel like a big company over there,

712
00:42:09.561 --> 00:42:09.720
right.

713
00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:13.610
Was probably like 10 engineers and a product guy and a marketer like just trying

714
00:42:13.611 --> 00:42:17.450
to launch it into space.
So it's not,
it's not only company,

715
00:42:17.451 --> 00:42:19.430
it's sort of its team and its,
um,

716
00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:23.360
remit and it's how much that thing is the same as everything else going on at

717
00:42:23.361 --> 00:42:25.850
the company or how much it's unique.
The more it's the same,

718
00:42:25.851 --> 00:42:29.900
the more your skill set has to be bureaucratic in nature and the more it's

719
00:42:29.901 --> 00:42:32.990
different,
the more your skill set has to be getting things done in nature,

720
00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:34.790
let's say.
Thank you.
Elliot.

721
00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:40.090
<v 2>Can you talk more about living below your means and how this plays into the</v>

722
00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:42.900
decisions you're talking about?
You mentioned renting and quality,

723
00:42:42.910 --> 00:42:46.150
now you own Montauk.
Can you explain a little bit more,
you know,

724
00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:49.270
live through Billy,
like how that impacts

725
00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:52.230
<v 0>the question was,
can you talk about,
it's a good question.</v>

726
00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:55.320
Living below your means and how that can create optionality,

727
00:42:55.350 --> 00:42:58.470
I think that creates optionality.
It gives you flexibility in your career.

728
00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:02.180
I have never successfully done it yet.

729
00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:07.740
And there are people who go on CNBC and they'll tell you like the way to become

730
00:43:07.741 --> 00:43:11.670
a millionaire is you just stop having a latte every day at Starbucks and then

731
00:43:11.671 --> 00:43:14.160
over time the interest compounds and you'll be a millionaire.

732
00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:19.110
I've met millionaires.
None.
No one has ever said to me,

733
00:43:19.350 --> 00:43:20.610
I just stopped drinking lattes

734
00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:27.540
and Al bloated.
It's um,

735
00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:31.530
it's good to be a saver.
It's good to live below your means.

736
00:43:31.531 --> 00:43:33.870
People who do that are better people than I am.

737
00:43:34.830 --> 00:43:38.670
What I have found instead is that whatever you make,
you spend.

738
00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:42.450
And I,
um,
and therefore to the earlier point,

739
00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:46.680
I figure out what we really need at this moment in time in our family to be

740
00:43:46.681 --> 00:43:49.530
happy and then how much we need to sort of save for retirement and the kids'

741
00:43:49.531 --> 00:43:50.280
school and all that stuff.

742
00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:53.940
You add it up and that's the amount of money I need to make and I'm painfully

743
00:43:53.941 --> 00:43:55.180
aware of if we make any more,

744
00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:57.930
you're just going to get an extra bedroom on the apartment or something.
Right?

745
00:43:57.931 --> 00:44:00.330
Like it's,
it's,
it's going to in my life.
Is this going to get spent?

746
00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:03.180
And I also know that that extra bedroom of the apartment is not happiness,

747
00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:08.040
not living the career and the life with a purpose that is meaningful to me is

748
00:44:08.041 --> 00:44:12.650
happiness.
And I also,
I have friends who have successfully gone this way too.

749
00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:14.970
They have just said,
look,
we spend too much money.
It's not worth it.

750
00:44:14.971 --> 00:44:15.511
Let's just like,

751
00:44:15.511 --> 00:44:20.250
let's get down to the basics of what we need so that we can be happier.

752
00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:24.390
And that's fair too.
I don't know that I could successfully pull that off either.

753
00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:25.433
Um,

754
00:44:25.890 --> 00:44:30.890
it just feels to me like the spending becomes somewhat permanent and so in a

755
00:44:31.501 --> 00:44:35.220
weird way,
my advices know what that number is.

756
00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:39.990
Make it disregard any more that you make and understand that if you do make it

757
00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:43.410
and you save it,
you're a really good person.
But it'd be spend it,
I feel you.

758
00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:44.423
I've been there.

759
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:46.343
<v 1>Okay.</v>

760
00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:53.880
<v 0>I'll come right back to you a little bit more about</v>

761
00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:56.890
<v 1>your roadmap as it related to,</v>

762
00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:04.410
<v 0>so my roadmap and the decisions I made after leaving Google ob,</v>

763
00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:07.820
I had a terrific job and worked with great people at Google.
My,
my,

764
00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:11.190
my job over time became more bureaucratic,
which wasn't for me.

765
00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:14.970
And also there is a point at which,
um,
you might feel in your career,

766
00:45:14.971 --> 00:45:18.090
this sort of flattening of either what you're learning or just this sort of,

767
00:45:18.091 --> 00:45:21.930
the trajectory of your career in the current path that you're on.

768
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:27.180
And someone called me with an opportunity to be the CEO of a,

769
00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:32.010
basically something that was being built from scratch and checked a bunch of

770
00:45:32.011 --> 00:45:33.030
boxes for me

771
00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:38.410
and it was the absolute wrong one.
It was,
uh,

772
00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:43.650
it was a catastrophe catastrophe.
But in doing it,

773
00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:48.750
I got to really for the first time in the wild be a CEO and I absolutely loved

774
00:45:48.751 --> 00:45:52.650
it and I learned a ton.
Um,
and it went well.

775
00:45:52.651 --> 00:45:56.670
Operationally was working or issue is sort of investor relations related,

776
00:45:56.671 --> 00:46:00.150
but it was operational,
it was working.
And I was like,
I think I can do this job.

777
00:46:01.650 --> 00:46:05.690
And the next thing that presented itself was even better.
Um,
it's where,
and it's,

778
00:46:05.691 --> 00:46:07.530
it's where I am now.
So in a way,
I mean,

779
00:46:07.531 --> 00:46:10.200
this is a personal anecdote and I don't know what it's worth,

780
00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:14.790
but I made a mistake when I made a change,

781
00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:19.650
but the bigger mistake would have been not making a change optimally,

782
00:46:19.651 --> 00:46:22.710
I would have left for something that was a success and a catastrophe right out

783
00:46:22.711 --> 00:46:25.050
of the gate and save two years of my life,
that would have been optimal.

784
00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:30.420
But the next best option was just forward progress.

785
00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:36.680
I can't emphasize how important doing is to success.

786
00:46:38.551 --> 00:46:41.540
And it sounds,
it sounds so obvious,
but I have a,

787
00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:45.510
but I have a story about a friend of some of ours at one point,

788
00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:48.720
remember when Yahoo Bought Tumblr?
I don't know why he was,

789
00:46:48.721 --> 00:46:49.880
he was possessed with the eye.

790
00:46:49.881 --> 00:46:54.180
The cute started blogging about that this was a bad deal.
I was like,
who cares?

791
00:46:54.181 --> 00:46:58.230
But this,
our friend really cared to blogging and blogging about how this was a,

792
00:46:58.330 --> 00:47:02.010
that this was a bad deal for Yahoo.
And then he paints some people on Twitter.

793
00:47:02.011 --> 00:47:03.690
He's like,
what do you think about all the things I've been writing about?

794
00:47:03.691 --> 00:47:05.880
What a bad deal this is?
And people tweeted about it and so on.

795
00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:09.090
And then Bloomberg television called him and asked if he'd come on as an expert

796
00:47:09.091 --> 00:47:10.170
to talk about this deal.

797
00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:13.650
Everyone is looking for someone who knows what they're talking about and knows

798
00:47:13.651 --> 00:47:16.710
what they're doing and no one does.
So if you just act like you do,

799
00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:19.920
you eventually get this shit you're after.

800
00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:24.080
So forward.
Motion is just really,
it's,

801
00:47:24.081 --> 00:47:27.000
it's really important and I don't know,
for whatever that's worth,
that was,

802
00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:29.530
that's my life.
I wouldn't do it.
There were some of those,
go ahead.

803
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:31.640
<v 1>Okay.
So my question was about</v>

804
00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:38.260
kind of what you do,
but sometimes you know,

805
00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:41.870
any filters,
maybe you say,
I don't want to live anywhere else,
but you aren't,

806
00:47:41.871 --> 00:47:45.190
but then I need a good opportunity because it's like,

807
00:47:45.191 --> 00:47:49.120
how do you think about [inaudible] to me

808
00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:54.540
<v 0>the question was how do you think about temporary sacrifices in your design</v>

809
00:47:54.541 --> 00:47:57.000
principles to move your career ahead more quickly?

810
00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:02.910
It's really important to know which of your design principles are constraints

811
00:48:03.210 --> 00:48:06.150
versus desires.
And if,
um,

812
00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:10.890
so for me a constraint is the time I needed to spend with my children.

813
00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:14.430
So I won't,
there are jobs that for two years I just want to see them,

814
00:48:14.431 --> 00:48:17.100
but it's only two years.
But they'll,
they'll,
they'll never be this age again.

815
00:48:17.610 --> 00:48:21.840
So for me,
I just,
that one I won't budge on.
I won't budge on it at all.

816
00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:23.700
There's other stuff that you know,

817
00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:27.120
most people are not as psycho as I am about wanting to live in New York,

818
00:48:27.121 --> 00:48:29.520
like they'll take it,
but they'd also moved to California for the right deal.

819
00:48:29.521 --> 00:48:34.050
She's up to know which ones for you are fixed constraints and which ones are are

820
00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:37.440
negotiable and the fixed constraints don't even think about it like you.

821
00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:42.000
You made a principal decision with clear eyes and then something came along and

822
00:48:42.001 --> 00:48:46.500
tried to get you to think differently.
At one point in my career,
I just said,

823
00:48:46.501 --> 00:48:47.334
you know what?

824
00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:52.110
I'm not going to play golf like I'm just not.

825
00:48:52.111 --> 00:48:53.970
Everyone gets tried to pressure me to play golf.
Oh,

826
00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:56.280
business gets done in the golf course.
You have to play golf.

827
00:48:56.281 --> 00:48:59.970
We're going on a golf trip.
No,
I hate golf.
I'm not doing it.
It's so liberating.

828
00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:02.070
It's liberating.
Now every time someone's like,
oh,
hey,

829
00:49:02.071 --> 00:49:06.690
we're putting this thing together.
There's golf.
I'm like,
nope,
not doing it.

830
00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:12.150
You've got to decide what those fixed constraints are for you.
The questions,

831
00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:13.920
<v 1>I love it.</v>

832
00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:18.920
This approach is very good questions to ask Adam mentors and advisors to get the

833
00:49:20.371 --> 00:49:23.550
best advice from that.
What are the

834
00:49:23.550 --> 00:49:27.030
<v 0>best questions to ask of mentors and advisors to get the best advice for them?</v>

835
00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:28.093
Um,

836
00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:33.360
there's a book called the finer points of leadership that's a good read and

837
00:49:33.361 --> 00:49:33.831
there's a code,

838
00:49:33.831 --> 00:49:37.380
there's a concept in there called the career covenant and the Covenant is you

839
00:49:37.381 --> 00:49:38.370
agree with your manager.

840
00:49:38.371 --> 00:49:41.040
Then I'm going to do really good work for you and help make you as my manager is

841
00:49:41.041 --> 00:49:41.790
successful.

842
00:49:41.790 --> 00:49:46.620
What I'd like from you is advice and I'm championing championing my career.

843
00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:51.270
Would you be willing to do that with me?
Any manager worth her salt will say yes.

844
00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:54.820
Then in a with a manager like that,
you've you,

845
00:49:54.821 --> 00:49:57.630
you've negotiated that we're going to be talking about my career from time to

846
00:49:57.631 --> 00:50:00.060
time and then you can just ask anything.
Yeah,
I asked for feedback.

847
00:50:00.061 --> 00:50:03.480
A great way to ask for feedback.
Everybody in this room like you go to,

848
00:50:03.930 --> 00:50:07.410
you go to the tech talks for like you're probably winning,

849
00:50:07.411 --> 00:50:08.670
you're probably getting good scores.

850
00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:10.500
Your feedback is usually you're doing a great job.

851
00:50:11.010 --> 00:50:13.350
So that was a managing director.

852
00:50:13.530 --> 00:50:16.410
What would I have done differently with this project?
Well,
I mean,

853
00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:18.510
you're not a managing director.

854
00:50:18.511 --> 00:50:19.890
I'm not asking you to make me a managing director.

855
00:50:19.891 --> 00:50:22.320
What's the difference between me and a managing director?
Well,

856
00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:26.010
you would have asked so many annoying questions.
That's fair.
That's helpful.

857
00:50:26.130 --> 00:50:27.060
Tell me what I could have done.

858
00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:29.090
Not Ask somebody annoying questions and on and on and on.

859
00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:33.320
So I think forcing feedback on yourself that is not just,
did I do a good job,

860
00:50:33.350 --> 00:50:36.440
help me make me feel good about the job.
It just did.
But okay,

861
00:50:36.441 --> 00:50:38.990
people are much better than me.
What would they have done different?

862
00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:42.320
Gets you that kind of feedback that can really fuel your career.

863
00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:44.870
And then I think with people who you don't know as well,

864
00:50:44.871 --> 00:50:47.870
people who were in other jobs,
other professions,

865
00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:50.390
when you meet people,

866
00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:56.170
just be so vulnerable and willing for them to know that you don't know what

867
00:50:56.450 --> 00:50:59.630
they're talking about and keep,
keep,
keep asking them questions.

868
00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:02.190
So you're at some like,
you know,
my wife and me.

869
00:51:02.191 --> 00:51:04.820
So you go to these fancy dinners and you'd have to meet random people.

870
00:51:04.821 --> 00:51:08.900
This is terrible is my life.
And so you're like,
Hey,

871
00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:11.180
what do you do Tom?
And Tom's like,
oh,

872
00:51:11.181 --> 00:51:14.780
I work in debt capital markets for Goldman Sachs.
And I'm like,
what?

873
00:51:14.781 --> 00:51:17.240
Everyone says,
they're like,
oh cool.
That capital markets,

874
00:51:19.610 --> 00:51:24.500
how's that capital market's going this year?
I say,
what's the capital markets?

875
00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:26.750
Which is,
it's embarrassing,
right?

876
00:51:26.751 --> 00:51:28.070
I live in and how long have I lived in New York?

877
00:51:28.071 --> 00:51:30.200
How could I not know what to capital market?
So,
so tell me what is,

878
00:51:30.201 --> 00:51:31.760
I don't work in finance.
What is that?
Capital Markets.

879
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:36.230
We create liquidity for investment grade companies.
What's liquidity?

880
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.970
For some reason people describe their jobs in a way that makes it sound so

881
00:51:40.971 --> 00:51:44.300
complicated.
And when you keep asking,
they finally give up and they say,

882
00:51:44.810 --> 00:51:48.860
we loan money to Ge.
When I say,

883
00:51:49.610 --> 00:51:52.040
I say,
oh,
that's brilliant.
I said,
Ge makes a lot of money.

884
00:51:52.041 --> 00:51:54.740
Why would they need to borrow money?
He says,
honestly,

885
00:51:54.741 --> 00:51:58.400
these days it's just to buy back their stock.
It's financial engineering.

886
00:51:58.820 --> 00:52:03.050
And then I go,
how does that work?

887
00:52:03.610 --> 00:52:05.450
And then they explain it to you and I'm like,

888
00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:08.810
what do you have to do to be good at that job?
Ge can borrow money from anyone.

889
00:52:08.811 --> 00:52:11.030
They have great credit.
Why would they borrow it from you?
He says,

890
00:52:11.031 --> 00:52:14.510
well that's all sales.
Tell me how you win in sales.

891
00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:17.200
For me it's a relationship game.
I take the guys out but blah,

892
00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:19.580
blah blah and I know more about the market.
How do you know more about the organ?

893
00:52:19.930 --> 00:52:23.240
It is like anybody else have a five year old.
I have a five year old,

894
00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:27.770
I am the five year old of asking you about your career.
Why?
Why?
Why did you that?

895
00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:28.610
What does that mean?

896
00:52:28.610 --> 00:52:31.460
What's the opposite of apple that that that that like on and on and on.

897
00:52:33.110 --> 00:52:37.550
I just keep going until I really know what this person does and I can really

898
00:52:37.551 --> 00:52:39.530
engage them in a discussion and I've taken something from it.

899
00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:44.850
Or until they just like they surrender and one way they surrenders,

900
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:48.170
they go,
what do you do to try to make you stop?

901
00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:50.810
The other is they drink their drink really fast and they're like,

902
00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:53.150
oh my drinks have to have to go to the bar.
That's all right.

903
00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:57.980
The people who stay with you,
these are people that you're now familiar with.

904
00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:00.710
Next time you see them,
like I'm not like,

905
00:53:00.711 --> 00:53:05.120
hey Tom from debt markets,
how are you?

906
00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:07.520
I'm like,
Tom,

907
00:53:07.610 --> 00:53:10.340
I just heard interest rates moved and I remember what you told me about what

908
00:53:10.341 --> 00:53:12.560
that means for liquidity.
Are People still buying back stock?
And he's like,

909
00:53:12.561 --> 00:53:13.111
you're not gonna believe it.

910
00:53:13.111 --> 00:53:15.680
Nobody's buying back stock where it's 10% to goal this year we're getting
killed.

911
00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:19.570
Like I'm having a conversation with Tom.
So you're talking to a mentor,

912
00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:23.570
someone in an industry that you like,
just ask questions like,
uh,
I don't know,

913
00:53:23.571 --> 00:53:25.410
like a five year old.
There's gotta be a better way to that,

914
00:53:25.411 --> 00:53:29.790
but ask questions like a five year old.
We had a couple of minutes left.

915
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:30.833
Anyone else?

916
00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:43.270
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

917
00:53:45.260 --> 00:53:47.750
<v 0>next question was time management,
but people have a meeting next.</v>

918
00:53:47.751 --> 00:53:49.520
I'll pause for a second.
Anybody needs to go,

919
00:53:49.521 --> 00:53:51.860
go and I'll stay and answer the time management question.

920
00:53:51.861 --> 00:53:54.950
Even if you don't stay and to,
so we'll give it a minute.

921
00:53:55.070 --> 00:53:56.380
Thank you guys for coming.
It was great.

922
00:53:56.570 --> 00:54:00.260
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

923
00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:05.190
<v 0>next page is time man.
How much time you got?
I'll give you,</v>

924
00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:08.250
I'll give you like the three minute version and then if you want to ask more,

925
00:54:08.251 --> 00:54:10.530
but you guys are welcome to leave as you want to leave.
So

926
00:54:15.350 --> 00:54:18.560
you're working hard and you have obligations.
You have family.

927
00:54:18.590 --> 00:54:22.940
Some of you are in an adult kickball league,
like there's just no timeline,
right?

928
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:27.800
So how do you also work a career plan and meet with mentors and read books on

929
00:54:27.801 --> 00:54:30.920
accounting and all that stuff if you,
um,

930
00:54:32.050 --> 00:54:33.620
so you have to be hyper productive.

931
00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:39.560
And if you calculate the number of hours that are already spoken for in your

932
00:54:39.561 --> 00:54:43.370
life,
you have sleep eight hours,
you have to sleep it.

933
00:54:43.371 --> 00:54:46.580
Ours don't believe anyone who tells you otherwise.
You must sleep eight hours.

934
00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:49.370
You have to exercise an hour a day.
You have to,
you really should.

935
00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:53.960
You have to bathe,
you have to eat.
And if you're ambitious,

936
00:54:53.961 --> 00:54:57.620
you work 60 hours a week,
which over seven days averages out to,
you know,

937
00:54:57.740 --> 00:55:00.890
call it eight hours,
eight and a half hours a day.
You add that all up.

938
00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:04.940
You have fun on an average day blending weekends and weekdays you have five

939
00:55:04.941 --> 00:55:09.410
hours of discretionary time every day you have five hours to live.

940
00:55:10.370 --> 00:55:15.370
That's your time to proactively decide how you are going to spend it and what

941
00:55:16.131 --> 00:55:17.180
you're going to achieve with your life.

942
00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:23.740
The average American spends five hours a day on social media and television and

943
00:55:24.231 --> 00:55:25.940
then they all say,
I have no time

944
00:55:28.260 --> 00:55:29.093
<v 1>if</v>

945
00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:36.750
<v 0>and the bell tolls for you for five hours.</v>

946
00:55:36.751 --> 00:55:41.700
You could be doing anything you want,
anything you want.

947
00:55:41.701 --> 00:55:44.340
You could put more hours into your work so you don't work 60 hours,

948
00:55:44.341 --> 00:55:49.290
you work 70 there have been points in my career while it's been 80 you decide

949
00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:52.740
when that's appropriate.
If you have kids,
you oh time to your kids.

950
00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:53.970
I love my children.

951
00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:58.350
Five hours every night is a lot a lot to gets you there.

952
00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:02.550
You have time with friends.
You spend a proactively,

953
00:56:02.610 --> 00:56:04.560
you decide how you're going to invest those five hours,

954
00:56:04.561 --> 00:56:08.130
a portion of those five hours.
I invest in personal development almost everyday,

955
00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:09.000
right?
Reading.

956
00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:11.580
There's a list of things that I know I want to read and I know I want to learn.

957
00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:13.073
Um,

958
00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:17.820
spending time with people in the space who can give you perspective,
et Cetera.

959
00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:19.980
A proactive investment of that time.

960
00:56:20.130 --> 00:56:24.970
If you believe the 10,000 hour rule with five every day and just a few years,

961
00:56:24.971 --> 00:56:27.130
you could also be a concert pianist.
This is up to you.

962
00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:32.350
Five hours is a ton of time,
but most of us don't invest it proactively.

963
00:56:32.650 --> 00:56:36.370
It gets invested for us.
We work,
get up.
You're like,
shit,
what am I doing today?

964
00:56:36.371 --> 00:56:39.190
All right.
He scrambled.
He like,
I'm not going to go to gym now.
Go after work.

965
00:56:39.191 --> 00:56:40.024
You work,

966
00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:43.180
somebody bothers you and then it's six and you've got to get home and then you

967
00:56:43.181 --> 00:56:45.010
didn't go to the gym and you're home and you scramble it.

968
00:56:45.011 --> 00:56:47.440
The kids and he would just beat and you're like,
all right,

969
00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:48.640
I know I have some work to do about it.

970
00:56:48.670 --> 00:56:53.200
Like all of this veg out for a minute and next thing you know Netflix is saying

971
00:56:53.201 --> 00:56:57.100
to you,
are you still there?
Does that ever happened to you get a life.

972
00:56:57.910 --> 00:57:02.350
Of course I'm still here.
I have found that when I proactively say,
Hey,

973
00:57:02.351 --> 00:57:07.340
I want to spend my time and then put it in my calendar that it works and you

974
00:57:07.341 --> 00:57:09.160
calendars is really powerful operating system.

975
00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:13.300
You never miss a one on one with your manager because it's in your calendar and

976
00:57:13.301 --> 00:57:16.630
you go and yet somehow like we keep not going to the gym.

977
00:57:17.110 --> 00:57:20.230
It's in my calendar when I read is in my calendar.

978
00:57:20.231 --> 00:57:23.860
When I get in bed it's in my calendar.
It's really weird

979
00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:27.970
but it is really effective.

980
00:57:28.210 --> 00:57:33.210
There's this block of time on Saturday that is my personal time now with my

981
00:57:33.731 --> 00:57:38.620
family and it's not work related.
It's investment in things I want to learn,

982
00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:41.710
explore or contribute like it's my time,

983
00:57:42.250 --> 00:57:44.860
5:00 AM to about 10:00 AM that's mine.

984
00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:48.460
Here's this block of time where going to be me with the kids and I will not

985
00:57:48.461 --> 00:57:52.570
check an email.
I cannot be bothered.
I'm going to be with my kids.

986
00:57:52.571 --> 00:57:56.530
It's dedicated time and it's so much more powerful and you wake up on Saturday

987
00:57:56.620 --> 00:58:00.880
and you're like,
all right,
what are we going to do?
So the most

988
00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:07.440
passionate advice I could give you on this topic is to proactively schedule your

989
00:58:07.570 --> 00:58:11.290
five hours.
I can also tell you,
um,

990
00:58:11.710 --> 00:58:13.810
and I said this in passing,
but like when you sleep,

991
00:58:13.811 --> 00:58:17.080
you really are much more productive.
They did a,
uh,
an experiment.

992
00:58:17.110 --> 00:58:21.490
People were asked to sleep six hours a night for two weeks and they performed

993
00:58:21.491 --> 00:58:25.180
cognitively and physically at the same level of people who had pulled back to

994
00:58:25.181 --> 00:58:28.390
back all nighters.
When you don't sleep,

995
00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:32.440
you suck at everything.
And we're all ambitious.

996
00:58:32.441 --> 00:58:35.620
And so we're looking for an extra hour in an extra hour and you take it out of

997
00:58:35.621 --> 00:58:36.970
sleep and it's a,

998
00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:41.890
it's massively destructive to your ability to be productive.

999
00:58:42.430 --> 00:58:43.780
So the way to do it,
I said before,

1000
00:58:43.781 --> 00:58:46.390
like I literally have an alarm that goes off that tells me it's time to get in

1001
00:58:46.391 --> 00:58:49.150
bed and I have to plug my phone and not by my bed.

1002
00:58:49.151 --> 00:58:50.680
Because if I bring my phone to the bed,

1003
00:58:50.681 --> 00:58:52.660
then I will lay in the bed with the phone for another hour.

1004
00:58:53.590 --> 00:58:56.740
The phone is actually over by the door next to my gym clothes.

1005
00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:59.200
And when the alarm goes off,
I get up,
I get out of bed,
I go,

1006
00:58:59.201 --> 00:59:01.210
I grabbed the phone and I'm right there with my gym clothes.

1007
00:59:01.211 --> 00:59:02.440
So I know I have to go to the gym now.

1008
00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:07.800
Like you can create these barriers or these guardrails in your life that force

1009
00:59:08.231 --> 00:59:11.770
you to proactively and intelligently invest your time and the things that

1010
00:59:11.771 --> 00:59:16.300
maximize your productivity.
Other questions?

1011
00:59:19.210 --> 00:59:24.080
Oh,
so this was if we had enough time,
essentially
quickly,

1012
00:59:24.290 --> 00:59:27.410
the way to manage your to do's is to figure out what's the goal you're trying to

1013
00:59:27.411 --> 00:59:29.630
achieve?
How much impact can this action item have?

1014
00:59:29.631 --> 00:59:33.290
How fast can you do it and by when is it due?
And we tend to,

1015
00:59:33.291 --> 00:59:36.050
we have a tendency to go to a meeting and some to do's come up and they go to

1016
00:59:36.051 --> 00:59:40.220
the top of the list.
And my advice is you will never do everything on your list.

1017
00:59:40.490 --> 00:59:45.490
So always assess every to do and only do the high leverage ones that you can

1018
00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:49.760
first,
the ones that you can do quickly that are due soon.

1019
00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:52.850
And then the high leverage ones that take a long time and match them to the

1020
00:59:52.851 --> 00:59:55.310
amount of time that you have.
So you know,

1021
00:59:55.311 --> 00:59:56.780
like you have 15 minutes between meetings,

1022
00:59:56.781 --> 00:59:59.570
so you come back to your desk and you open an email and it's like a 20 page

1023
00:59:59.571 --> 01:00:02.510
PowerPoint you're supposed to read and then you read like four pages of it.

1024
01:00:02.511 --> 01:00:03.980
But then yeah,
the 15 minutes are up.

1025
01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:06.380
So then you run to the meeting and then you come back and you're like,
okay,

1026
01:00:06.381 --> 01:00:08.540
let me go to my email.
And you're like,
oh,
this PowerPoint,
where was I?

1027
01:00:08.541 --> 01:00:11.360
And you start to basically start over,
not matching.

1028
01:00:11.690 --> 01:00:14.660
The important task to the amount of time with which you can use to get it done

1029
01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:17.540
is the way that most people make themselves unproductive.

1030
01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:20.353
<v 1>Nope,</v>

1031
01:00:21.890 --> 01:00:24.920

This is a lot of fun.
So I'll put my,</v>

1033
01:00:26.511 --> 01:00:28.580
I'm more than happy to help is great to see you.

1034
01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:30.470

1035

you guys.
