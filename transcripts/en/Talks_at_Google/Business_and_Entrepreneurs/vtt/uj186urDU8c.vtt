1
00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.180
Okay,
I'm going to do the official introduction.
I'm how very,

2
00:00:11.181 --> 00:00:13.760
I'm the chief economist here.
I think many of you know me,

3
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.210
Glenn Wiles of principal researcher at Microsoft is,
sorry,

4
00:00:17.211 --> 00:00:20.120
eight principal researcher at Microsoft Research New England.

5
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.680
And this year he's visiting Yale University as a senior research scholar and

6
00:00:24.681 --> 00:00:28.730
lecture in the Economics Department and the law school where he teaches a joint

7
00:00:28.731 --> 00:00:33.680
economics computer science course called designing the digital economy.

8
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.720
Glen is a townie.
He grew up in Palo Alto,

9
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.910
received his Ab and economics or Princeton,

10
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.270
followed by an MBA and a phd in 2008.

11
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.500
He then spent three years as a junior fellow at the Harvard Society of fellows

12
00:00:48.501 --> 00:00:52.550
in three years as an assistant professor at the University of Chicago before

13
00:00:52.551 --> 00:00:54.830
joining Microsoft.
And uh,

14
00:00:54.831 --> 00:00:58.490
over the period from 2014 to 2018,
he's a,

15
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.770
he's been a Sloan research fellow and today he's here to tell us about his book,

16
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.900
radical markets,
uprooting capitalism and democracy for a just society.

17
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.220
Take it away.
Thanks.
Hello.

18
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.250
<v 3>And thanks to everyone for coming.
So,
um,</v>

19
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.890
this work is the culmination of many years of sort of careful policy design

20
00:01:25.611 --> 00:01:29.960
research with Eric Posner.
Um,
but,
uh,

21
00:01:29.961 --> 00:01:32.000
in the 10 minutes I have to introduce it.

22
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.930
I think rather than going into the details of all of the proposals that we have,

23
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.080
it's best to just give you a flavor of the,

24
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.300
the sort of broad idea that we're trying to get across.

25
00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:46.010
And I think that that's best conveyed by a thought experiment.
So I want you to,

26
00:01:46.011 --> 00:01:46.844
for the moment,

27
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.900
suspend your practical considerations and come with me on a journey of

28
00:01:50.901 --> 00:01:55.130
imagination to a fictive city that I'm in a call market topia.

29
00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.210
So Market Topia is a bit like Zootopia,

30
00:01:59.211 --> 00:02:04.040
except rather than being defined by having a diverse group of mammals that

31
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.050
inhabited instead market topia is defined by the fact that all the major,

32
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.810
uh,

33
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.810
private property in a market Topia um,

34
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.750
let's put aside personal effects like,
you know,
uh,

35
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.150
heirlooms and pets and so forth.

36
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.480
But all the land and the houses and the airplanes and so forth is continually up

37
00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:34.001
for auction to the highest bidder in a manner somewhat similar to the way that

38
00:02:35.091 --> 00:02:39.230
search terms are for Google a advertisements.

39
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.580
So,
um,
basically,
uh,

40
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.970
whoever is currently the highest bidder on one of these,
uh,

41
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.440
pieces of private property controls it for the time being by making a rental

42
00:02:51.441 --> 00:02:56.441
payment continually into a central pot until someone else comes along and beats

43
00:02:56.901 --> 00:03:01.480
their price and takes over that payment for control of that asset.

44
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.830
And that's not just true of private property in a market.

45
00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:09.220
Topia in fact,

46
00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:13.630
many things that we would usually consider to be determined by collective

47
00:03:13.631 --> 00:03:17.650
decision making processes like the,
um,

48
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.900
the,
uh,
uh,
location of parks and,

49
00:03:23.901 --> 00:03:27.220
uh,
the politicians that govern market topia.
Uh,

50
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.090
what sort of schools they have and what they teach and so forth.

51
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.250
These are also determined by an auction process though rather than a auctioning

52
00:03:36.251 --> 00:03:37.480
them to the highest bidder.

53
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.590
We add up the total willingness of everyone to pay for different alternatives

54
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.640
and we implement the one that people are willing in total to pay the most for.

55
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.830
And all of the money that's raised by these auctions is continually return to

56
00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:55.831
all the citizens of market Topia in equal shares as a social dividend or you

57
00:03:56.861 --> 00:03:58.990
might call it a universal basic income.

58
00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.180
Much as in Norway and Alaska.
When they auction off oil rights,

59
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.390
they return the revenue that they raise to the citizens.
Okay.

60
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.590
Now when you hear this idea of market,
Toby,

61
00:04:11.591 --> 00:04:16.300
it might sound like sort of the most extreme version of a free market that you

62
00:04:16.301 --> 00:04:16.961
can imagine.

63
00:04:16.961 --> 00:04:21.961
It's sorta like much crazier than anything that say Adam Smith could have

64
00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:24.090
imagined.
Um,

65
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.160
because it makes you realize that even though we live in a market society,

66
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.270
most things are not available for liquid purchase at any given point in time.

67
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.400
You know,
most of the land on the Google campus,
uh,

68
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.360
most of the stock of Google,
in fact,
not just the,

69
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.150
the marginal units of stock that are currently on bid,

70
00:04:46.151 --> 00:04:47.800
but most of the stock that all of you hold,

71
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.160
these aren't things you could just go out and buy it some price at any point in

72
00:04:51.161 --> 00:04:52.420
time.
Um,

73
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.220
those are instead controlled by often wealthy concentrated interests.

74
00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.460
And if you wanted to grab control of those assets,

75
00:05:00.461 --> 00:05:05.170
you'd have to enter into a long and drawn out process of bargaining and probably

76
00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:09.460
pay many times what the person would be willing to accept as they get wind that

77
00:05:09.461 --> 00:05:11.170
you'd want to buy that thing.
Right?

78
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.340
And so market Topia is a far more extreme,

79
00:05:15.341 --> 00:05:19.870
complete free market than any,
uh,
society,
uh,
uh,

80
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.550
in history.
Um,
and that might lead you to think,

81
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.450
okay,
so in market Topia the wealthy are going to dominate everything,
right?

82
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.730
The wealthy are going to be able to outbid the prices that anyone else is going

83
00:05:31.731 --> 00:05:34.750
to pay.
They're going to take control of assets and they're going to use that to

84
00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:38.350
dominate everyone else in society.
But then you asked to ask yourself,

85
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.370
what do you mean by the wealthy?
Well,

86
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.580
a wealthy person is someone who has lots of assets like stocks and bonds and

87
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.880
houses and land and businesses,
right?

88
00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.750
But in market topia there is no private ownership of those things.

89
00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.810
All of those things are auctioned for the public benefit.

90
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.943
In fact,

91
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:06.010
market Topia is actually sort of the most extreme version of the sort of common

92
00:06:08.211 --> 00:06:12.020
ownership advocated by people like Karl Marx that you can imagine much more

93
00:06:12.021 --> 00:06:15.230
extreme than forms of socialism that actually existed,

94
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:20.410
which ended up in the control of those assets by a concentrated bureaucratic

95
00:06:21.411 --> 00:06:26.330
elite that often ended up tyrannizing over the rest of the population even more

96
00:06:26.331 --> 00:06:31.160
intensely than the capitalists that they claim to replace.
Um,

97
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.690
in market.
Toby,
on the other hand,

98
00:06:32.691 --> 00:06:36.650
there is true common ownership because by construction,

99
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.250
all the value of all assets flow equally to all citizens.

100
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:41.840
And by construction,

101
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:46.900
every citizen has an equal right to compete for control of assets.

102
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.660
So this might seem like a paradox,

103
00:06:50.661 --> 00:06:55.010
especially to those of us who grew up in the cold war and post Cold War periods.

104
00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:55.641
How can,

105
00:06:55.641 --> 00:07:00.410
like the most extreme form of common ownership of sort of communism go along

106
00:07:00.411 --> 00:07:03.470
with the most extreme form of a free market?
Well,

107
00:07:03.471 --> 00:07:07.460
while that might seem like a paradox,
it's actually,
uh,

108
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.520
a crucial part of what was the central tradition in a field called political

109
00:07:14.841 --> 00:07:18.740
economy that gave birth to economics,

110
00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:21.320
political science,
um,

111
00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.550
sociology in many other fields during the late 19th century.

112
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:27.470
And,
uh,

113
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:32.450
this idea called competitive common ownership was especially associated with the

114
00:07:32.451 --> 00:07:37.010
work of this guy here.
Um,
and I wonder if anyone recognizes him.

115
00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:39.590
Who is that?
Well,

116
00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:43.740
this is the first time anyone has actually managed to identify head.

117
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:48.890
Well,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm glad I came to the right place

118
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:55.460
so you could probably repeat the following things for me.
But Henry George was,

119
00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:57.170
um,
uh,

120
00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:01.580
the bestselling author in the English language other than the Bible for about 30

121
00:08:01.581 --> 00:08:02.390
years.

122
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:07.110
His book progress and poverty was the namesake of the progressive movement,
uh,

123
00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:08.390
in the United States.

124
00:08:08.391 --> 00:08:13.220
He helped inspire the Chinese nationalist revolution and many other things.

125
00:08:13.221 --> 00:08:15.770
So he's an enormously influential person.

126
00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:21.220
And yet his ideas are largely forgotten in the post Cold War era.

127
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:26.840
And the goal of this book is to revive the tradition,
uh,

128
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:30.260
that was represented by Henry George and others like Leon Vol,
Ross,

129
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:35.450
many of the founders of modern economics who believed that free market,

130
00:08:35.451 --> 00:08:39.230
true free markets and true socialism went hand in hand.

131
00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:44.690
And,
uh,
to argue that while these ideas were forgotten in mainstream culture,

132
00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:49.280
they continued to be developed in a field called mechanism design,
which a one,

133
00:08:49.281 --> 00:08:53.680
lots of Nobel prizes but was largely applied,
um,

134
00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:58.140
to things like auctioning off search words that,
uh,
you know,

135
00:08:58.141 --> 00:09:02.670
companies like Google and Facebook rather than to the big problems of social

136
00:09:02.671 --> 00:09:06.600
organization.
And to show that we can,
based on this tradition,

137
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:11.220
have a new way of organizing society to address our most pressing problems.

138
00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:12.240
Um,

139
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.890
and the way that we do that is by developing five detailed practical policy

140
00:09:16.891 --> 00:09:21.840
proposals,
building off of this spirit,
um,
that,
uh,

141
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:24.960
instantiate this idea and address,
um,

142
00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.720
we think some of the most pressing problems of inequality,

143
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.470
a slow growth and,
um,
uh,

144
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:36.090
social conflict over political issues.
So what are those ideas?

145
00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:39.290
Um,
the first,

146
00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.860
which is most closely associated with this auction I was describing is the

147
00:09:42.861 --> 00:09:47.861
common ownership self assess tax in which every owner of significant private

148
00:09:49.101 --> 00:09:54.101
property would self assess the value of that property at some value stand

149
00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.690
willing to sell the property at that value and then pay a tax on that self

150
00:09:59.691 --> 00:10:00.524
assessed value.

151
00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:05.330
So this would be a way of implementing the auction that I was describing without

152
00:10:05.331 --> 00:10:08.600
taking all ownership into the public so that people would still have some

153
00:10:08.601 --> 00:10:13.310
incentive to make investments.
Um,
do I turn off this?

154
00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:20.430
Um,
so people would still have an incentive to make investments,

155
00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:23.850
uh,
and uh,
at the same time,

156
00:10:23.851 --> 00:10:28.650
all assets would be liquidly available for turnover to a better potential use.

157
00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.100
The second idea is quadratic voting.

158
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:35.040
This is a system of sort of auctioning,

159
00:10:35.041 --> 00:10:39.570
but for collective decision making that would protect minorities by allowing

160
00:10:39.571 --> 00:10:44.370
them to express the greater strength of their interest in given issues,

161
00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.170
uh,
compared to majority's,

162
00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:49.680
the way that it would work is that every citizen would be endowed with a budget

163
00:10:49.681 --> 00:10:54.681
of voice credits that they could spend on different politicians or issues.

164
00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:58.750
Uh,
in a referenda that are important to them.
Um,

165
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.860
and they could put more votes on the issues that were more important to them,

166
00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:03.870
but according to a very particular rule,

167
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:08.430
which is that the cost invoice credits of influence on any given issue would be

168
00:11:08.431 --> 00:11:13.200
the square of the number of votes that you buy on that issue.
Um,

169
00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:14.670
third,

170
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:19.670
we propose a new system of migration in which immigration would benefit rather

171
00:11:20.401 --> 00:11:25.020
than just the immigrants and the capitalists in the wealthy countries.
Instead,

172
00:11:25.021 --> 00:11:28.170
it would immigrant,
uh,
it would,
uh,
uh,

173
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:32.820
benefit all citizens because rather than large corporations or governments

174
00:11:32.821 --> 00:11:36.240
determining who was admitted to the country,
instead,

175
00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:41.360
individual citizens would have the right to sponsor visas for migrants and to

176
00:11:42.001 --> 00:11:44.190
negotiate subject to some protections,

177
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:49.400
a share of the benefits that the migrants received from migrating to wealthy

178
00:11:50.041 --> 00:11:54.340
countries.
Um,
so that would allow for massively increased migration.

179
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:58.330
But with the broad support of the working classes of wealthy countries.

180
00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:00.370
Fourth,

181
00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:05.370
we argue that antitrust policy is an incredibly powerful tool for maintaining a

182
00:12:06.791 --> 00:12:08.440
competitive and dynamic economy.

183
00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:12.880
But that it has been almost completely unenforced in the two most important

184
00:12:12.881 --> 00:12:16.720
areas in which market power is accumulating in our economy.

185
00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.980
And therefore we've been ignoring about 80% of the or night,

186
00:12:20.981 --> 00:12:24.340
maybe even 90% of the potential benefits of antitrust.

187
00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:29.140
Those two areas are that first of all,
institutional investors like vanguard,

188
00:12:29.141 --> 00:12:31.000
state street,
blackrock,

189
00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:36.020
etc. Now control about a third of the total corporate economy and are the four

190
00:12:36.851 --> 00:12:41.740
or five largest shareholders of almost every major corporation,
uh,

191
00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:45.280
straight across industries,
Google and Microsoft,

192
00:12:45.281 --> 00:12:47.080
American Airlines and Delta.

193
00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:50.290
And therefore they have no interest in seeing these companies compete with each

194
00:12:50.291 --> 00:12:51.010
other.

195
00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:56.010
And we've seen rising prices in re in coral close correlation to the growing

196
00:12:57.101 --> 00:12:59.560
power of these companies.
Um,

197
00:12:59.561 --> 00:13:03.550
so that's sort of the most comprehensive market power that's ever existed

198
00:13:03.551 --> 00:13:08.210
because it's coordinated almost the entirety of the corporate economy.
Um,

199
00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:13.270
another area that's been almost completely neglected by antitrust policy has

200
00:13:13.271 --> 00:13:18.271
been the power that companies have over workers rather than over consumers.

201
00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:22.300
Because,
uh,
uh,
if you think about,
you know,

202
00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:26.500
a typical consumption decision you make,
like what type of water to drink?

203
00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:30.040
There's probably 10 or 15 reasonable alternatives you have.

204
00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:31.450
Whereas if you think about job,

205
00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:34.150
what's your next best job rather than working at Google,

206
00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:38.830
it's probably a way worse option.
And maybe you have one other option,

207
00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:42.300
but uh,
but it's,
you know,
much harder,

208
00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:46.570
much less competitive than is a typical a product market.

209
00:13:46.571 --> 00:13:51.430
And yet there's literally never been an antitrust merger case for that blocked

210
00:13:51.431 --> 00:13:55.990
the merger because of the way it reduced options for employment for workers.

211
00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:58.960
And finally,

212
00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:03.910
we argue that the individual contributions that people make to the digital

213
00:14:03.911 --> 00:14:08.680
economy should be treated as a label,
as essentially labor.

214
00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:12.400
And that there should be a labor movement that of people who are contributing

215
00:14:12.401 --> 00:14:14.470
that data to uh,

216
00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:19.500
organize to demand a fair share of the value created by their data from

217
00:14:19.871 --> 00:14:22.510
companies like Google,
Facebook and Microsoft.

218
00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:28.020
Because increasingly people are worried about artificial intelligence taking

219
00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:29.800
people's jobs.

220
00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:34.810
But as all of us here know that all that artificial intelligence is trained

221
00:14:34.811 --> 00:14:39.700
based on human data and it's in fact a lot more like a,

222
00:14:39.701 --> 00:14:44.140
some sort of broadcasting of our data than it is just brilliant engineers,

223
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:48.500
programming computers to go and take people's jobs.
And so,
uh,

224
00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:51.590
if people were more fairly compensated for their data,

225
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:56.090
the digital economy would be a source of economic opportunity for people rather

226
00:14:56.091 --> 00:14:59.630
than,
uh,
an economic threat.
Now,

227
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.580
all of these ideas are quite radical.

228
00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:05.120
All of them would require fundamental changes to our social institutions.

229
00:15:05.121 --> 00:15:07.250
And while for each of these chapters,

230
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:12.490
we have concrete near term noncontroversial steps we can make in that direction.

231
00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:17.150
Um,
we also know that as a broad social philosophy,

232
00:15:17.151 --> 00:15:21.020
no one would seriously consider this if we weren't in a moment of social crisis

233
00:15:21.021 --> 00:15:26.021
that really deeply required new out of the box thinking like this to avoid

234
00:15:26.391 --> 00:15:28.010
potentially catastrophic outcomes.

235
00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:32.120
But I truly do believe we are in a moment like that for three reasons.

236
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:36.170
One,
uh,
is growing inequality.

237
00:15:36.171 --> 00:15:41.171
So on the left here we see a graph of the share of national income,

238
00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:42.831
uh,
uh,

239
00:15:42.831 --> 00:15:47.150
accruing to the top 1% in top 0.1% of the income distribution,

240
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:51.710
which has doubled since the 1970s.

241
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:56.930
And at the same time we've seen a dramatic reduction in the share of income

242
00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:01.940
accruing not just to lower income workers but to all workers in total.

243
00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:06.410
So the share of income being paid out to labor as opposed to capital has fallen

244
00:16:06.411 --> 00:16:10.820
by 10% over this period.
Now you might think,
uh,

245
00:16:10.821 --> 00:16:15.020
as say Ronald Reagan or Margaret Thatcher would have argued that,

246
00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:18.920
well that might be worth it if that's the price of a more dynamic,

247
00:16:18.921 --> 00:16:21.440
more competitive,
more innovative economy.

248
00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:26.240
But at the same time that we've seen this declining share going to labor,

249
00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:31.420
we've seen an increasing power of corporations to exert monopoly power.

250
00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:35.930
Um,
so that is represented by this orange line here.

251
00:16:35.931 --> 00:16:38.270
I've taken the markup that firms charge.

252
00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:41.210
That is how much above their marginal costs they charge.

253
00:16:41.211 --> 00:16:45.710
And I've flipped it around so you can see how closely it parallels the decline

254
00:16:45.711 --> 00:16:46.610
in labor incomes.

255
00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:51.290
So that strongly suggests that far from US getting a more competitive economy by

256
00:16:51.291 --> 00:16:55.490
deregulating cutting taxes and,
you know,
relaxing antitrust policy,

257
00:16:55.550 --> 00:17:00.360
we've actually seen an increasing growth of market power,
um,

258
00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:03.200
that is actually reducing,
uh,

259
00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:08.000
growth rates in the economy as represented in this graph here.

260
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.830
So what this shows is a growth rates in different,
uh,

261
00:17:12.831 --> 00:17:15.860
wealthy countries in the immediate post war period,

262
00:17:15.861 --> 00:17:20.640
and then various periods thereafter.
And the period of the last,
uh,
you know,

263
00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:25.660
several decades has had growth rates that are in the United States about half

264
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:28.580
and in many other wealthy countries,

265
00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:33.080
about a 10th of what they were in the immediate post war period.

266
00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:38.540
Um,
so this combination of stagnation with growing inequality,

267
00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:43.690
I think has largely discredited existing economic ideologies as coming out of

268
00:17:44.421 --> 00:17:48.110
Reagan and Thatcher in the same way that the stag,

269
00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:52.530
the combination of stagnation and inflation during the 1970s discredited the

270
00:17:52.531 --> 00:17:55.050
previous Keynesian Orthodoxy.

271
00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:59.760
And this stagnant quality is,
we label it.

272
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000
And the discrediting of existing economic ideologies has also led to rising

273
00:18:07.351 --> 00:18:10.680
political discontent and conflict,
um,

274
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:15.540
together with the fact that I think,
uh,
political institutions,

275
00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:18.420
not just economic,
uh,
technocracy,

276
00:18:18.421 --> 00:18:22.740
but political technocracy is increasingly being viewed as illegitimate.

277
00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:26.280
There's a growing conflicts between minorities and majorities,

278
00:18:26.281 --> 00:18:29.460
whether over immigration,
uh,

279
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:34.520
ethno racial conflict or over a say things like gun ownership,

280
00:18:34.681 --> 00:18:35.820
religious minorities.

281
00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:40.500
And yet the way that a wealthy countries have increasingly resolve these issues

282
00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:45.180
has been through the judiciary,
uh,

283
00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:49.710
or through supernational institutions in the case of the European Union that

284
00:18:49.711 --> 00:18:54.711
lack the democratic legitimacy needed for countries to come to some reasonable

285
00:18:55.681 --> 00:18:56.820
way of resolving this.

286
00:18:57.030 --> 00:19:02.030
So there's an increasing feeling that the economic policies and the way that we

287
00:19:02.131 --> 00:19:04.260
resolve political disputes are illegitimate,

288
00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:08.460
and that's leading to the rise of populous leaders,

289
00:19:08.461 --> 00:19:11.650
whether on the right like Trump or Brexit,
mu,
uh,

290
00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:16.560
a movement or on the left like Jeremy Corbyn in the United Kingdom.

291
00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:18.930
So,
um,
given all this,

292
00:19:18.931 --> 00:19:23.931
I think we increasingly feel like the only path out is these sort of reactionary

293
00:19:25.561 --> 00:19:27.930
populous movements that don't really offer an answer.

294
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:32.280
And so we feel the responsibility at this moment to try to put forward an

295
00:19:32.281 --> 00:19:33.001
alternative,

296
00:19:33.001 --> 00:19:37.170
progressive path that can harness the powers of marketing and technology,

297
00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:39.930
but to try to make a more equal,

298
00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:44.940
a prosperous and politically a cooperative society.
And,

299
00:19:44.941 --> 00:19:45.450
uh,

300
00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:50.450
I hope that you'll open your minds to these radical possibilities,

301
00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:52.920
uh,
given what we're facing.

302
00:19:52.921 --> 00:19:55.860
And I'm looking forward to chatting with all of you and with Hal about it.

303
00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:58.460
<v 1>All right,
great.</v>

304
00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:03.970
Very interesting talk and let me raise a few objections here and there because I

305
00:20:04.371 --> 00:20:08.330
know that she's your favorite pastime is responding to these objections.

306
00:20:08.331 --> 00:20:12.260
You know,
they say a cynic believes that everything has a price,

307
00:20:12.261 --> 00:20:13.970
but an economist knows it's true.

308
00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:19.000
So one interesting angle there on that,

309
00:20:19.001 --> 00:20:23.150
a division dividing things up with them,
letting people trade.

310
00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.130
Um,
what do you do about the ability?

311
00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:30.620
The ability is very tricky because suppose you're a great singer.

312
00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:34.010
I love to hear you sing.
Yeah.
But it's very tiring for you.

313
00:20:34.011 --> 00:20:38.390
You don't want to do it.
Can I outbid you and say yes,

314
00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:43.010
I bid him.
He wants to have a quiet evening at home.
But I've got this money,

315
00:20:43.011 --> 00:20:45.110
I'm going to pay him to go out and say it.
So that that's a,

316
00:20:45.111 --> 00:20:48.040
that's a great question.
We tackle in the conclusion

317
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.830
<v 5>of the book for the main part of the book,</v>

318
00:20:50.831 --> 00:20:55.831
we only allow for capital to be allocated in this way and we think that at least

319
00:20:56.561 --> 00:20:59.650
in our present society that could address much,
uh,

320
00:20:59.651 --> 00:21:03.220
of the inequality though not all of the inequality that we face.

321
00:21:03.221 --> 00:21:05.770
So we calculate that with our reforms.

322
00:21:05.771 --> 00:21:10.510
You could get down below the levels of inequality in the 1970s and a

323
00:21:10.511 --> 00:21:12.640
significantly better than in Sweden that president,

324
00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:17.140
but obviously there would then be a shift towards inequalities that are driven

325
00:21:17.141 --> 00:21:21.580
more by ability and away from those driven by wealth.
And,
uh,

326
00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:24.370
those would have to be addressed by future reforms.

327
00:21:24.371 --> 00:21:29.170
And we speculate in the direction that you're describing how,
but we,
we,

328
00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:33.760
we,
we don't have a proposal that we're happy with,
uh,
actually putting forward,

329
00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:37.700
<v 1>I'm not sure,
let me suggest an article.
It was something I wrote.</v>

330
00:21:37.701 --> 00:21:41.810
It was my thesis actually,
which was odd fair division.
Oh,
I know that.
We're very,

331
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:42.663
well,

332
00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:47.030
there were a couple ideas there about how you might deal with this issue of

333
00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:51.800
either redefining what would it be fair when there's differences in ability or

334
00:21:51.801 --> 00:21:56.540
in fact going the very radical plan of actually I could outbid you to sing.

335
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.943
And uh,

336
00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.330
<v 5>yeah,
so I'm actually doing it sympathetic to that idea,</v>

337
00:22:00.331 --> 00:22:02.220
but for a bunch of practical reasons,

338
00:22:02.221 --> 00:22:05.040
we talked about in the conclusion we don't think we have a proposal that

339
00:22:05.041 --> 00:22:07.980
actually makes sense,
but as a philosophical level,

340
00:22:07.981 --> 00:22:12.750
you'll recognize your own writing in what we say about that issue.
So

341
00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:16.110
<v 1>it's also interesting because there is a practical example.</v>

342
00:22:16.111 --> 00:22:20.240
There were apprenticeships.
Yeah.
So what happened in America,

343
00:22:20.241 --> 00:22:23.430
I mean before there was the United States,
in fact,
back in,
uh,

344
00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:25.470
pre-revolution days,
uh,

345
00:22:25.471 --> 00:22:30.210
you could bring an immigrant in and the quid pro quo is it worked for you for

346
00:22:30.211 --> 00:22:32.280
seven years and you would teach them a trade.

347
00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:37.640
And so this was viewed as a very successful way to provide education and skills

348
00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:39.090
and so on.

349
00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:42.390
<v 5>I wouldn't say that too loudly because on the Internet when we certainly weren't</v>

350
00:22:42.391 --> 00:22:46.590
advocating indentured servitude,
but we just talked about our immigration system,

351
00:22:46.591 --> 00:22:51.400
which is not indentured servitude.
We got the most crazy reaction,
uh,

352
00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:55.770
from social media.
So it's a sensitive subject.
Yes,
yes,
I agree.

353
00:22:55.771 --> 00:22:57.070
And it's also illegal.
Yes.

354
00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:03.200
<v 1>They're self assess tax.
I was kind of fun.</v>

355
00:23:03.201 --> 00:23:07.790
I first heard this idea from Dixie cows or you know,
many years ago about,

356
00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:12.800
and he claims that the Greeks used as for assessing.
Yeah,

357
00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:15.520
we talked about in chapter one some detail.
Yeah.

358
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:19.520
And in fact we did something very much like it for the top level domain names

359
00:23:19.521 --> 00:23:22.520
when we had this top level domain name auction.

360
00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.610
So Microsoft and Google for example,

361
00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:30.170
both my one dot doc as a TLD.
And uh,

362
00:23:30.171 --> 00:23:33.230
the way it was resolved is you each write down your price.

363
00:23:33.231 --> 00:23:36.680
The high bidder gets it then pays the other bidder,
the,

364
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:41.810
the price that it,
that it bid.
So it's a,
it's a kind of interesting mechanism.

365
00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:45.590
It's not of course perfect the lea,
anybody,

366
00:23:45.591 --> 00:23:47.200
any economist that shoots a Molson it.

367
00:23:47.201 --> 00:23:50.060
But it seemed to work pretty well in practice.
Um,

368
00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:54.050
these's data as labor.

369
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:58.220
What we do that now we'd pay labelers of data.

370
00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:03.310
We have just donated 9 million images to the open image project that we paid

371
00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:09.710
lots of people around the world to label that data with the contents.

372
00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:13.640
Uh,
we did the same thing,
4.5 million youtube videos,

373
00:24:13.641 --> 00:24:18.641
which we had people label and that goes into the video project,

374
00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:23.330
uh,
consumer panels like Nielsen that's around all the time.

375
00:24:23.331 --> 00:24:28.331
So there is a market for getting people to provide data labeling or data of one

376
00:24:30.321 --> 00:24:33.950
sort or another.
I said it's not a reasonably,

377
00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:35.640
I mean it's a pretty big market reading.
Yeah.

378
00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:39.350
I think that the problem is that the vast majority of data we get,

379
00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:43.610
we collect from people who aren't aware of the productivity roles that it ends

380
00:24:43.611 --> 00:24:48.611
up playing that and trying to engage those people more and paying them a bit

381
00:24:49.611 --> 00:24:53.390
more for this people who are in context who can provide additional value.

382
00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:57.210
And in fact,
Google does a little bit of that with the local hosts,
uh,

383
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:59.030
and so forth.
But,
uh,

384
00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:03.200
but I think trying to make people more broadly aware of that and trying to

385
00:25:03.201 --> 00:25:08.120
create a structure where they would get direct compensation for improving the

386
00:25:08.121 --> 00:25:11.270
quality of the data they provide and be aware of the payments they were getting

387
00:25:11.271 --> 00:25:16.080
for all of their data.
Would in the medium term create,
uh,

388
00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:21.280
the opportunity for people to build greater,
uh,
uh,

389
00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:26.300
human capital really and,
uh,
contribute more online?
Well,

390
00:25:26.301 --> 00:25:30.740
there is this question of what the payment would look like if you take Facebook

391
00:25:30.741 --> 00:25:33.020
as an example,
cause I think you've mentioned this,

392
00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:38.530
a Facebook had net earnings of a 10 billion and they claim they're 2 billion

393
00:25:38.541 --> 00:25:42.590
users and that means $5 a year per user.

394
00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:45.470
So mean Google has similar numbers of course.

395
00:25:45.471 --> 00:25:50.240
So these work out to pennies per day in terms of the compensation for

396
00:25:50.241 --> 00:25:52.700
information that people are providing.
An,
and I would argue,

397
00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:58.040
I certainly believe for Facebook and I started to leave for Google and also

398
00:25:58.190 --> 00:26:03.070
Facebook.
Of course,
a lot of this data is used to improve the product,
right?

399
00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:06.380
So people are benefiting from it as benefiting as a public good,

400
00:26:06.381 --> 00:26:07.400
not as a private good,

401
00:26:07.401 --> 00:26:10.460
but they get their private benefit from using better products.
Absolutely.

402
00:26:10.461 --> 00:26:15.080
So I think that if we had more targeted direct compensation to people,

403
00:26:15.081 --> 00:26:19.010
we would get larger product improvements.
Um,

404
00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.440
I would dispute with you a little bit about some of the numbers.

405
00:26:21.441 --> 00:26:25.970
I've done different calculations then then,
then that exactly.
But,
but yes,
at the,

406
00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:29.840
at the moment things are relatively small I think by any calculation.

407
00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:35.080
But in a future where artificial intelligence really does come to take the role

408
00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:40.420
that investors are pricing into your company and into my company,
uh,

409
00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:41.330
it taking,

410
00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:46.570
I think that if we don't find a way to directly compensate people for the data

411
00:26:47.161 --> 00:26:50.610
contributions that they're making that are fueling those artificial
intelligence,

412
00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:53.940
we're going to end up with a lot of what I would call fake on employment where

413
00:26:53.941 --> 00:26:57.510
people are unemployed but not because they're not contributing value,

414
00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:01.200
just because the value that they are contributing isn't being counted

415
00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:06.270
appropriately.
So,
so if you look at the web writer's handbook,

416
00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:09.540
I was just looking at this a few days ago,
I know several people here,

417
00:27:09.541 --> 00:27:10.374
I've looked at this,

418
00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:15.560
we pay thousands of people around the world to answer questions about page

419
00:27:17.461 --> 00:27:18.294
quality.

420
00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:22.830
That is the labeling that then goes into determination of the algorithms and the

421
00:27:22.831 --> 00:27:27.150
uh,
and the machine learning that helps make the system work.
So,

422
00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:31.380
so there is a direct market and paying people to label and we could do much more

423
00:27:31.381 --> 00:27:33.480
of that for sure.
But the question is,

424
00:27:33.481 --> 00:27:37.290
should it be done through the product improvement side of things?

425
00:27:37.291 --> 00:27:39.840
It shouldn't be done just as a line item on the budget.

426
00:27:39.841 --> 00:27:44.841
We're paying people to rate or evaluate this or label this a material in a way

427
00:27:45.541 --> 00:27:47.960
that helps us design a superior product.
Yeah.

428
00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:51.570
And I think that if more people were aware of the contributions that they're

429
00:27:51.571 --> 00:27:56.110
making and we're getting compensation for it,
you would,
I mean the,
the,

430
00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:59.460
there are absolutely markets as you're describing for those labelers.

431
00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:01.410
They are a little bit sidelined.

432
00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:06.060
And the public image that is portrayed is one in which you don't know.

433
00:28:06.061 --> 00:28:07.170
You're sorry.
You're very right.

434
00:28:07.171 --> 00:28:10.770
I mean nobody knows about this even though it's a easy to check.
Yeah.

435
00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:13.350
I think I think center,
you know,

436
00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:16.380
putting that more center stage and making more people feel like they're

437
00:28:16.381 --> 00:28:21.060
participating in it I think would change the whole feeling of using the Internet

438
00:28:21.061 --> 00:28:24.720
in a way that I think would be productive for our social conversation around

439
00:28:24.721 --> 00:28:25.554
technology.

440
00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:30.770
Well it is interesting how many people write reviews for Amazon and for Google

441
00:28:31.351 --> 00:28:35.940
or for Yelp because people are volunteering this information in many cases.

442
00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:38.190
And I think you might want to argue that,

443
00:28:38.191 --> 00:28:43.191
well the incremental addition to that free service is worth paying for.

444
00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:45.860
And maybe it is,
maybe is,

445
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:49.860
it depends on how much you're getting people to contribute generously of their

446
00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:54.960
time in terms of doing these evaluations.
Yeah.
Well that's,
it might be,

447
00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:56.820
it's an empirical matter.
Ah,

448
00:28:56.930 --> 00:29:00.840
I'm going to ask one more question and I apologize is a slightly technical,

449
00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:05.160
but your,
your chart on the Labor inverse Labor share and the uh,

450
00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:08.640
and the markup.
I've actually been working on that problem.

451
00:29:08.641 --> 00:29:12.640
This is a paper by a gluten Daluca they are referring to.
Uh,

452
00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:17.660
and it's a little funny because remember markup is the uh,

453
00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:21.270
prize over marginal costs.
Yeah.

454
00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:26.220
So the markup can go up either by price going up or by marginal costs going
down.

455
00:29:26.221 --> 00:29:29.970
Right.
And of course we think costs going down.
Gee,
that's a good thing.

456
00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:34.070
Price going up.
That's a bad thing.
But of course,
by making,
you know,

457
00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:38.720
by moving around these two things,
you can change the level of the ratio of a,

458
00:29:38.721 --> 00:29:42.070
a price of marginal cost.
So in fact,
if you take the formula

459
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:44.680
<v 5>in that paper for the markup,</v>

460
00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:49.050
it's also a formula for marginal cost is rearrange the Algebra.

461
00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:51.090
<v 1>Yeah.
And if you go out and do the calculation,</v>

462
00:29:51.091 --> 00:29:54.300
look at the same data or the same source of data that they looked at,

463
00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:59.040
see costs going way,
way down.
You also see just one,
one last point.

464
00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:01.500
You also see prices going down.

465
00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:05.550
And the question is what's happening is the marginal cost is going down even

466
00:30:05.551 --> 00:30:07.430
faster than the prices are going down.
So

467
00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:08.930
<v 5>gap is going up.
Yeah.</v>

468
00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:13.640
So I mean marginal costs fell dramatically as well during the postwar period.

469
00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:18.080
Yeah.
Um,
and in fact even more dramatically just productivity,
uh,

470
00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:19.160
when I'm more quickly,

471
00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:22.850
my view is not everything has been terrible in the last few years.

472
00:30:22.851 --> 00:30:24.890
That's not the,
the,
the point,

473
00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:29.310
the point is that if we don't have social institutions that were unrestrained

474
00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:29.931
market power,

475
00:30:29.931 --> 00:30:34.580
that keep up with the progress of technology will fail to realize the potential

476
00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:35.481
that we can have,

477
00:30:35.481 --> 00:30:39.650
which requires constantly breaking up the sources of rigidity that enter the

478
00:30:39.651 --> 00:30:41.480
economy as technology advances.

479
00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:45.620
And I think we did that more effectively in the immediate post war period along

480
00:30:45.621 --> 00:30:49.670
certain dimensions though not all dimensions than we've managed to do it since

481
00:30:49.671 --> 00:30:54.020
then.
So my argument is not everything has just gotten worse.
Of course not.

482
00:30:54.021 --> 00:30:56.090
We wouldn't have had economic growth if that hadn't front of them,

483
00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:59.960
but that we haven't managed to keep up in the innovation of our social

484
00:30:59.961 --> 00:31:03.500
institutions with the innovation that we've had on the technological side.

485
00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:08.980
So let me make one other objection to the [inaudible] work because I don't do,

486
00:31:12.050 --> 00:31:14.900
<v 1>you just said,
but if you look at that,</v>

487
00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:19.790
the surprising thing from other contributors is the same thing has happened in

488
00:31:19.791 --> 00:31:24.440
pretty much every industry that is labor share has gone down and pretty much in

489
00:31:24.441 --> 00:31:28.310
every country.
Yeah.
So it seems very strange to say,
ah,

490
00:31:28.311 --> 00:31:31.160
somewhere around 1980,
uh,

491
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:34.460
all these different countries and all these different industries became less

492
00:31:34.461 --> 00:31:38.900
competitive.
It's much more natural to say,
well,
the 1980s,

493
00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:43.850
we had a technological shock that lowered costs pretty much across all countries

494
00:31:43.851 --> 00:31:47.510
and pretty much across all industries is called the computer.
Right?

495
00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:52.550
Microcomputer as we've done and we've seen this technology work its way through

496
00:31:52.551 --> 00:31:53.960
with some leaders,

497
00:31:53.961 --> 00:31:57.500
that is some companies that are doing very well because we've managed to reduce

498
00:31:57.501 --> 00:32:02.010
their costs and improve their quality by,
uh,

499
00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:03.290
using this technology.

500
00:32:03.291 --> 00:32:06.200
We see in other companies that haven't done so well because they haven't done

501
00:32:06.201 --> 00:32:08.600
this to the same extent.
So to me,

502
00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:13.660
the technological hit that reduces marginal costs as much more plausible than

503
00:32:14.151 --> 00:32:16.550
the concentration hit,
which increases prices.

504
00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:20.670
<v 5>And what I would say is that we had those marginal cost falling before for</v>

505
00:32:20.671 --> 00:32:24.570
reasons that were in fact more powerful than the computer air conditioning,

506
00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:25.980
refrigeration,

507
00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:30.940
lots of huge technological advances except at that time we had policymakers who

508
00:32:30.941 --> 00:32:31.711
were innovating,

509
00:32:31.711 --> 00:32:36.711
coming up with things like the welfare state and antitrust policies and um,

510
00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:41.780
uh,
labor unions that were keeping up with technology.

511
00:32:41.781 --> 00:32:43.130
And in the 1980s,

512
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:48.260
we stopped trying to keep up with the innovations in social policy that were

513
00:32:48.261 --> 00:32:52.400
necessary to restrain market power within the technology sector.

514
00:32:52.401 --> 00:32:57.401
And that's the reason why we suddenly saw those prices not track as far down

515
00:32:59.211 --> 00:33:03.230
with marginal costs as they should have done to maintain both maximum

516
00:33:03.231 --> 00:33:07.250
productivity growth and about,
so that,
that,
that's a,

517
00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:10.930
<v 1>but the real debate,
I mean,
there were a question I think is,</v>

518
00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:15.570
is this just difficult to learn how to use and adopt this technology?

519
00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:19.180
When electricity came in,
we saw the same thing happened when Steve came in.

520
00:33:19.181 --> 00:33:20.080
We saw the same thing.

521
00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:22.810
It just takes time for this to work its way through the system.

522
00:33:22.811 --> 00:33:26.890
So you would expect some companies are going to be more productive than others

523
00:33:26.891 --> 00:33:28.900
because they've learned to master the technology.

524
00:33:28.901 --> 00:33:33.100
And two of those companies are represented right here,
Microsoft and Google.

525
00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:38.160
<v 6>All right.
That's my,
uh,
debate and I'm sure you've got some more,
uh,</v>

526
00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:41.810
ready questions coming.
Why don't we start here.
All right.
Uh,

527
00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:46.880
thank you so much for coming to speak and thank you for hosting and providing a

528
00:33:47.161 --> 00:33:51.340
lively discussion.
Uh,
my name's Steven.
So I have,
um,

529
00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:54.840
one question for you on a subject that you actually haven't really touched on

530
00:33:54.841 --> 00:33:58.930
yet,
which is,
uh,
the quadratic voting piece.
Yeah.
Um,

531
00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:03.950
simply because I think politics is sort of the iceberg to all of this.

532
00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:08.500
It's the underlying set of problems to all of this.
Um,
and so I'm,

533
00:34:08.501 --> 00:34:09.960
I'm curious one,

534
00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:14.610
how does that actually work in terms of how does one define the value that each

535
00:34:14.611 --> 00:34:17.010
person is given?
Is it a static,

536
00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:20.940
equal value or can you buy more if you have more income?

537
00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:26.130
Um,
and,
and to,
um,
if,
if you're willing to extend the sort of conversation,

538
00:34:26.131 --> 00:34:31.131
just how do you think the globalization of finance has impacted sort of this

539
00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:36.840
decoupling of productivity in wages that has happened over the past 30 years,

540
00:34:36.841 --> 00:34:37.990
which is,
um,

541
00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:42.540
greatly contributed to the rise in inequality and many of the problems that

542
00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:45.460
you're sort of discussing and thinking about today?
Um,

543
00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:50.930
<v 5>uh,
on the first point,
uh,
it would be not static.</v>

544
00:34:50.931 --> 00:34:53.660
It would be dynamic over time.
People would get voice credits,

545
00:34:53.661 --> 00:34:57.320
they would get a flow of voice credits the same way that they get a flow of a

546
00:34:57.321 --> 00:35:00.230
social dividend,
but it would be equal across all people.

547
00:35:00.231 --> 00:35:03.860
There would be no opportunity you use outside financial resources to purchase

548
00:35:03.861 --> 00:35:08.390
more in less in some much more advanced society.

549
00:35:08.391 --> 00:35:10.790
When some of these other ideas have been implemented,

550
00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:12.560
we have much greater equality,

551
00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:16.550
in which case we might consider allowing people at least at some rate to

552
00:35:16.551 --> 00:35:21.470
purchase more,
uh,
credits.
In terms of the globalization of finance,
look,

553
00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:25.220
I'm not 100% critical of what happened with neo liberalism.

554
00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:28.700
I think that there's been a huge amount of growth in the developing world and to

555
00:35:28.701 --> 00:35:32.840
a large extent that is attributable to the opening up of the international

556
00:35:32.841 --> 00:35:37.190
system to allow opportunities to many more people.
Unfortunately,

557
00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:41.400
uh,
while we opened up to other parts of the world.

558
00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:45.650
I think our economy domestically within the United States and with another

559
00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:49.970
wealthy countries allowed in this greater market power and to,

560
00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:51.150
to some extent,

561
00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:56.070
the external mark three uses a wedge to consolidate the power of capital within

562
00:35:56.071 --> 00:35:57.270
national boundaries.

563
00:35:57.510 --> 00:36:02.250
And so I think we need to rectify that because otherwise we're going to get a

564
00:36:02.251 --> 00:36:06.630
populous backlash that reacts to the fact that things got better abroad and they

565
00:36:06.631 --> 00:36:08.610
didn't get so much better here.

566
00:36:08.611 --> 00:36:13.140
And that feels like something that can be cured by xenophobia,

567
00:36:13.141 --> 00:36:17.790
which you can't really,
but uh,
but you see how people get that logic.

568
00:36:17.791 --> 00:36:21.960
So we need to find a better way to unite the interest of people within the

569
00:36:21.961 --> 00:36:24.000
country and around the world.

570
00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:27.560
<v 6>Yeah.
So,
uh,
I have a question.</v>

571
00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:31.130
What do you think we can learn from the political failures of the followers of

572
00:36:31.131 --> 00:36:34.850
Henry George and so on and so far as the land value tax,

573
00:36:34.851 --> 00:36:39.130
the optimal policy they were proposing at the time largely,
you know,

574
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:41.990
ran aground in the Lloyd George Budget and UK,

575
00:36:41.991 --> 00:36:44.330
the House of Lords largely said this,

576
00:36:44.331 --> 00:36:48.020
this Ninjas our interest here in California.
So I'm like pop their teen,

577
00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:53.140
which is largely the exact opposite of an allocator of efficient policy is

578
00:36:53.361 --> 00:36:55.010
impossible to get rid of seemingly.

579
00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:58.370
What do you think we can learn from these failures for putting better policy in

580
00:36:58.371 --> 00:36:59.090
the future?

581
00:36:59.090 --> 00:36:59.541
<v 5>Well,
I mean,</v>

582
00:36:59.541 --> 00:37:04.541
I think a major problem for Georgia them fundamentally was the failure of the

583
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:09.350
Chinese revolution because it ended up meaning that.
So Sonia Watson,
who is the,

584
00:37:09.351 --> 00:37:12.770
you know,
founder of the Chinese revolution,
uh,

585
00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:17.800
was basically had the same relationship to George that Lenin had to marks.

586
00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:23.210
And the problem was that,
uh,
you know,
Lyndon was much more ruthless.

587
00:37:23.211 --> 00:37:25.670
He managed to the Bolshevik revolution,

588
00:37:25.671 --> 00:37:29.000
managed to survive and communism spreading everything that became the leading

589
00:37:29.001 --> 00:37:30.410
alternative to capitalism.

590
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:35.710
And so we got stock in a discourse where everything was about capitalism versus

591
00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:40.620
communism.
And so I think in ultimately,
uh,

592
00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:45.880
if you can have a comprehensive ideology that helps people rethink things like

593
00:37:46.221 --> 00:37:49.250
Milton Friedman did,
he really changed the whole discourse.

594
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:53.550
I think that we can have a path where,
uh,

595
00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:57.380
people understand and believe in that.
And I think it came close in England.

596
00:37:57.381 --> 00:38:01.150
I think you change a few things and George's,

597
00:38:01.151 --> 00:38:03.410
him would have been very successful in England.

598
00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:07.300
But I think that the communist revolution was a big part of,
of,

599
00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:08.210
of what stopped it.

600
00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:12.650
<v 7>Hi,
thanks for the talk.</v>

601
00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:15.470
A really interesting point about the concentration of assets and you know,

602
00:38:15.471 --> 00:38:19.030
a few very large asset managers,
money managers.
Um,

603
00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:22.880
my question is where does the political will come from?

604
00:38:22.881 --> 00:38:24.740
Just sort of go after these guys,
you know,

605
00:38:24.741 --> 00:38:27.990
they control a lot and I guess this is more broad Jews,

606
00:38:27.991 --> 00:38:31.600
like they probably have captured the um,
you know,

607
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.160
the congress and you know,

608
00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:37.450
they're lobbing dives are going to be incredibly versus the very diffused sense

609
00:38:37.451 --> 00:38:38.830
among the populous that like,
oh,

610
00:38:38.831 --> 00:38:41.000
it's probably bad to have four companies control it.

611
00:38:41.001 --> 00:38:42.910
The majority of stock in the United States.

612
00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:45.530
<v 5>Yeah.
So,
um,
first of all,</v>

613
00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:50.320
the most powerful basis of the protection of the,

614
00:38:50.321 --> 00:38:54.620
of Capitol rents is free market rhetoric.
I mean,

615
00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:59.680
it's not just or even mainly things done in the dark back rooms.

616
00:39:00.830 --> 00:39:04.620
Free market rhetoric is something that so many people in this country believe
in.

617
00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:09.970
And if we can deny to the capitalist monopolists the use of free market rhetoric

618
00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:17.240
by saying that true free markets require radical reforms,

619
00:39:17.241 --> 00:39:18.800
radical egalitarian reforms,

620
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:23.950
I think we can change the political dynamic around these things significantly.

621
00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:29.210
Um,
but,
uh,
second of all,
you know,
it comes from young people.

622
00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:31.730
It comes from students.
That's where,

623
00:39:31.731 --> 00:39:34.880
that's how Milton Friedman change things in the direction that they went in the

624
00:39:34.881 --> 00:39:39.200
1980s,
uh,
capitalism and freedom sold terribly,
uh,

625
00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:44.240
among,
uh,
academics initially and it,
and it was very unpopular in the press,

626
00:39:44.241 --> 00:39:49.241
but students loved it and he had a coherent view and it applied to many things

627
00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:52.940
and he really changed the whole political discourse in the country.

628
00:39:52.941 --> 00:39:57.170
So I do believe that the medium term ideas clearly expositive,

629
00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:58.040
uh,

630
00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:02.570
with that tried to directly connect to the public can have a huge effect on

631
00:40:02.571 --> 00:40:05.700
world history.
Yeah.

632
00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:07.610
<v 8>Oh,
I have a question.
Uh,</v>

633
00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:11.250
I'm a Newbie to economic health politics and uh,

634
00:40:11.370 --> 00:40:15.010
reasons I watched ray Daleo is how economic works in 30 minutes.
Yeah.

635
00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:17.850
So he talks about borrowing and lending and he'd say,

636
00:40:17.851 --> 00:40:21.660
because of that we have credit and these new human nature that we tend to borrow

637
00:40:21.810 --> 00:40:26.810
power off on the future and which lead to some economic crisis because it's a

638
00:40:27.231 --> 00:40:29.070
cycle.
So I'm just wondering,

639
00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:32.610
in your ideal market,

640
00:40:32.650 --> 00:40:35.640
will there'll be economic crisis and if there are,

641
00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:39.750
would there be different a difference in how we address the economic crisis?

642
00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:41.620
<v 5>So I think that that's a great question.</v>

643
00:40:41.621 --> 00:40:45.370
I can't say that I confidently predict that there wouldn't be crises in,

644
00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:46.840
in the world that I'm describing,

645
00:40:46.841 --> 00:40:48.880
but I think that they would probably be less severe.

646
00:40:48.881 --> 00:40:50.770
And the reason is precisely what you just said,

647
00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:56.070
which is the death and the rigidity is associated with private property as well

648
00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:02.760
are a leading cause of what happens during economic crises.

649
00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:05.020
And in this world that would be far,

650
00:41:05.021 --> 00:41:10.021
far less debt because it would be much less important to take on debt and assets

651
00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:13.390
because the value of all assets would be greatly reduced.

652
00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:18.490
People would be effectively closer to renting assets and therefore many of the

653
00:41:18.491 --> 00:41:23.110
sources of instability that comes from debt finance would be much less severe.

654
00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:25.120
Okay.
Hey,

655
00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:28.430
<v 7>um,
my question is,
uh,</v>

656
00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:32.970
it seems to me like perhaps some,
uh,

657
00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:34.070
products are not

658
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:39.070
<v 1>naturally amenable to a constant liquid exchange.</v>

659
00:41:39.681 --> 00:41:41.450
Like may like housing for example,

660
00:41:41.451 --> 00:41:44.800
I might want to live in a particular place for decades at a time.
Yeah.

661
00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:48.230
And if I'm out bid on it and I don't want to leave,

662
00:41:48.231 --> 00:41:52.490
then getting me to do so requires violence.
Um,

663
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:57.770
or for example,
a physical infrastructure like trains.
Um,

664
00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:01.860
it seems like there would be an enormous cost of the administration of,

665
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:06.410
of this infrastructure.
We're constantly changing hands,
so,
okay.

666
00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:10.160
I mean,
I think that gives you enough to reply.
So,
um,

667
00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:11.793
<v 5>uh,</v>

668
00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:17.600
obviously you could maintain stability in this world by charging a higher price

669
00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:20.630
so that it's harder for someone to take something from you.

670
00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:25.010
Now in our present world as well,
stability is costly.

671
00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:26.960
Wealthy people,

672
00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:31.040
they live in safe areas that aren't hit by natural disasters.

673
00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:34.970
They own their houses outright.
They usually don't rent,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

674
00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:37.460
So they in germ enjoy much greater stability.

675
00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:41.960
The poor they rent or they are underwater often with their homes,

676
00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:47.410
either figuratively or literally sometimes living in a very dangerous areas.

677
00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:53.750
And so in this society,
just like in her presence,
society stability is costly.

678
00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:58.790
But the difference in this society is that everyone would have an equal or a far

679
00:42:58.791 --> 00:43:03.260
closer to equal basis to pay for that stability as they desired it.

680
00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:07.790
Then in our present society because you would tax the wealthiest demand for

681
00:43:07.791 --> 00:43:12.330
stability at the cost of the opportunity of the less well off.
Whereas,
uh,

682
00:43:12.450 --> 00:43:14.080
in our presence society,
uh,

683
00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:18.830
they can enjoy that stability at no cost to themselves or much more limited

684
00:43:18.831 --> 00:43:19.940
costs and themselves.

685
00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:31.090
<v 6>Hi,
it's me again.
I have lots of questions.
Um,</v>

686
00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:36.950
so with regard to both the self assessed tax and the quadratic voting,

687
00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:41.940
I'm sure the answers would be slightly different,

688
00:43:41.941 --> 00:43:45.780
but the question and problem that I'm posing I think are quite the same,

689
00:43:46.350 --> 00:43:47.580
which is how would you,
uh,

690
00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:52.640
limit collusion and sort of gaming of such a system in which individuals could

691
00:43:53.311 --> 00:43:55.140
on the self assess tax side,

692
00:43:55.740 --> 00:44:00.740
more or less set a price that is above market that others get by but low enough

693
00:44:00.931 --> 00:44:04.350
to maintain a lower tax.
And then on the political side,

694
00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:05.970
this happens in our elections already.

695
00:44:05.971 --> 00:44:10.080
People running sort of spoiler candidates in primaries or having some sort of

696
00:44:10.081 --> 00:44:13.670
spoil a referendum to try and split a boat.
Yeah.
Um,

697
00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:15.660
how would you imagine that could be a protected against,

698
00:44:15.661 --> 00:44:19.110
particularly when if I were to put more of my energy in one issue,

699
00:44:19.111 --> 00:44:23.760
I would necessarily be putting less energy and voice into another.

700
00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:24.530
So,

701
00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:25.363
<v 5>uh,</v>

702
00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:30.580
it's more than I have time for it to go into detail about each one of points in

703
00:44:32.041 --> 00:44:34.620
terms of,
uh,
collusion and so forth.

704
00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:37.140
But that's absolutely central thing to the book.

705
00:44:37.141 --> 00:44:40.330
I definitely encourage you to read the book.
Um,

706
00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:45.510
but the short version is all those sorts of problems exist in our present

707
00:44:45.511 --> 00:44:49.740
system.
They are dramatically reduced if not eliminated.

708
00:44:49.741 --> 00:44:52.440
And the system that I'm describing,
so I'll just give you one example.

709
00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:57.360
So right now there's the problem when you have an election of a spoiler

710
00:44:57.361 --> 00:45:00.630
candidate running and possibly,
you know,

711
00:45:00.631 --> 00:45:03.600
messing up the main two candidates,
but maybe even worse.

712
00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:07.410
There's the fact that you can have with two candidates that everyone despises,

713
00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:11.910
but everyone votes for one candidate to block the other candidate.
That's,

714
00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:14.970
I think an even worse problem than the spoiler in this system.

715
00:45:14.971 --> 00:45:18.450
You can show that that's not mathematically possible is what happens is that

716
00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:23.100
because of the quadratic nature of the costs,
if you really hate Hillary Clinton,

717
00:45:23.101 --> 00:45:26.940
you'll vote at least as much against Hillary is you'll vote in favor of Trump

718
00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:28.710
and vice versa.

719
00:45:28.890 --> 00:45:32.700
And so that pushes to candidates that everyone hates down to zero votes.

720
00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:36.510
And so then that leads other candidates to rise up.

721
00:45:36.511 --> 00:45:41.511
So you don't end up with these perverse strategic things where the two leading

722
00:45:41.521 --> 00:45:44.790
candidates get reinforced just to beat the other one.
Wait,
sorry.

723
00:45:44.791 --> 00:45:47.520
Could you repeat the I?
So,

724
00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:52.470
so if you have two candidates,
both of whom are really hated by the other side,

725
00:45:52.471 --> 00:45:54.690
but no one really likes them,
um,

726
00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:58.320
then what happens is that those candidates get negative votes on them.

727
00:45:58.410 --> 00:46:00.870
So they go down to like zero net votes.

728
00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:05.610
And so anyone else who is like not despised ends up becoming a leading

729
00:46:05.611 --> 00:46:10.590
candidate.
And so you can prove that that will lead to it never being the case,

730
00:46:10.591 --> 00:46:14.430
that you just get a perverse thing of two people that are really disliked

731
00:46:14.431 --> 00:46:18.730
winning.
Uh,
just to beat the other one.
Uh,

732
00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:20.820
yeah.
Back here.
You were,
you were waiting.

733
00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:21.990
<v 9>Yeah.
Thank you so much.
Um,</v>

734
00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:27.380
how do you think block chain technology relates to the ideas in your book or the

735
00:46:28.210 --> 00:46:29.160
research you've done?

736
00:46:29.290 --> 00:46:30.670
<v 5>So that's a wonderful question.</v>

737
00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:36.160
Vitalik latera and who's the founder of ethereum just wrote a wonderful long

738
00:46:36.851 --> 00:46:39.790
post about that.
Uh,
which I would definitely recommend to you.

739
00:46:39.791 --> 00:46:43.020
And he and I are writing something together that should come out this week,
uh,

740
00:46:43.090 --> 00:46:46.180
about the relationship.
But a very briefly,

741
00:46:46.181 --> 00:46:50.770
what I would say is the exact technological relationship is complex and it will

742
00:46:50.771 --> 00:46:55.390
evolve.
But philosophically I think they're very closely connected in particular,

743
00:46:55.570 --> 00:47:00.400
both are trying to figure out,
um,
monetary market based,

744
00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:05.730
distributed decentralized systems for ensuring through rules of the game rather

745
00:47:07.361 --> 00:47:10.290
than through discretionary authority,
um,

746
00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:14.470
that we have a more egalitarian distribution of economic power.

747
00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:15.903
Um,

748
00:47:16.210 --> 00:47:21.210
I think a major weakness in blockchain thus far has been that it's been focused

749
00:47:21.221 --> 00:47:25.240
primarily on the cryptographic protocols rather than on the substantive rules

750
00:47:25.241 --> 00:47:28.210
implemented by this cryptographic protocols.
And as a result,

751
00:47:28.211 --> 00:47:30.970
some of the rules of up giving power,
in fact,

752
00:47:30.971 --> 00:47:34.750
she'll oligarchic groups say in China than ended up controlling them.

753
00:47:34.930 --> 00:47:36.940
So they don't really achieve the goals that they're aiming at.

754
00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:40.720
What they need is a substantive set of rules to be implemented by those

755
00:47:40.721 --> 00:47:44.410
cryptographic protocols so that they actually instantiate their goals.

756
00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:48.130
And that's precisely what did Butera and tries to argue in this piece and that

757
00:47:48.131 --> 00:47:49.270
we're arguing together.

758
00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:53.680
So I think that there's a tight unity of purpose between these though.

759
00:47:53.681 --> 00:47:58.360
The actual technological connection is something that's going to need to develop

760
00:47:58.690 --> 00:48:01.270
in the coming years or months even.

761
00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:02.930
So I'm actually speaking at the main of theory,

762
00:48:02.931 --> 00:48:07.750
IOM conference on Saturday about exactly this stuff.
So,
um,
yeah,

763
00:48:07.751 --> 00:48:08.260
go ahead.

764
00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:12.380
<v 7>Just going back to the previous question to be announced,</v>

765
00:48:12.381 --> 00:48:17.381
I think trying to apply any rigorous mathematical proof to the political system,

766
00:48:17.451 --> 00:48:21.580
especially the American political system is doomed to failure.
But,
um,
yeah,

767
00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:25.880
I think one,
one,
one question I would have in terms of,
uh,
implementation.

768
00:48:25.881 --> 00:48:30.230
You mentioned that like this quadratic voting system seems like extremely

769
00:48:30.231 --> 00:48:31.990
radical.
How,

770
00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:34.940
what are the sort of baby steps that you mentioned in terms of actually trying

771
00:48:34.941 --> 00:48:36.500
to implement this,
especially in the u s

772
00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:40.600
<v 5>totally.
So,
um,
let me see if we don't have the computer going,</v>

773
00:48:40.601 --> 00:48:41.950
but I can show you afterwards.

774
00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:47.130
We have a nice user interface that even for people who haven't completed high

775
00:48:47.561 --> 00:48:50.590
school,
it makes it very intuitive to do quadratic voting.

776
00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:53.170
And we've been using that to do polling.
Um,

777
00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:54.970
and we've gotten some very interesting results.

778
00:48:54.971 --> 00:48:58.300
We were able to elicit intensity of preference much more reliably than you can

779
00:48:58.301 --> 00:49:02.110
get from existing methods.
Uh,
that's a good place to start.

780
00:49:02.111 --> 00:49:06.900
But the next place that we really want to go is ratings a say of,

781
00:49:06.910 --> 00:49:08.310
you know,
uh,

782
00:49:08.650 --> 00:49:13.480
ride sharing drivers or products online where you have this problem that people

783
00:49:13.481 --> 00:49:15.780
often go into extremes,
uh,

784
00:49:15.850 --> 00:49:19.990
and a lot of sort of troll trolling type a behavior.

785
00:49:20.110 --> 00:49:22.630
And if you made something costly and made,

786
00:49:22.631 --> 00:49:26.140
there'd be real trade offs for people to budget,
to up vote or down vote things,

787
00:49:26.290 --> 00:49:31.000
I think you could get much more reliable and useful feedback in a variety of

788
00:49:31.001 --> 00:49:31.834
circumstances.

789
00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:36.770
<v 7>But in terms of actually putting into place in,
in American elections,</v>

790
00:49:37.210 --> 00:49:39.910
<v 5>my view is that once you start using it in some of these commercial domains,</v>

791
00:49:39.911 --> 00:49:43.180
you gradually expand them outwards as people get more used to it in different

792
00:49:43.181 --> 00:49:47.680
domains.
So we greater willingness to experiment in other domains.
Uh,
you know,

793
00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:50.740
blockchain is another place where I think that it's quite likely that this will

794
00:49:50.741 --> 00:49:54.100
be used in some reasonably near term.
Um,

795
00:49:54.101 --> 00:49:57.670
and I think people will get used to the technology.
Like it's sorta like,

796
00:49:57.671 --> 00:49:58.580
you know,
um,

797
00:49:58.690 --> 00:50:03.690
he government happened to a large extent because of all the advances that were

798
00:50:04.391 --> 00:50:07.810
made in the private sector and then those were important into the public sector.

799
00:50:07.811 --> 00:50:09.970
So I expect something similar would happen with this.

800
00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:15.520
We'll take one more question.
Do you have the mic?
Go ahead.

801
00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:20.320
Yeah.
Okay.
Thank you for sharing your ideas.
Again,
I'm there.

802
00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:22.900
I'm looking forward to reading the book.
Um,

803
00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:28.160
you said that the primary of

804
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:33.160
<v 6>what you propose is because there is an impending doom almost if we don't do</v>

805
00:50:34.671 --> 00:50:37.010
something about the current status quo.
Yeah.

806
00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:42.160
But do you see this market topia being implemented without massive upheaval?

807
00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:47.450
Because I think what you're trying to suggest is that we need to save our

808
00:50:47.451 --> 00:50:52.070
society almost.
Yeah.
But from the way I see it,

809
00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:57.280
it seems like we almost need to almost throw away society in order to implement

810
00:50:57.411 --> 00:51:02.411
this without like the oligarchies without the current special interests

811
00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:08.500
basically taking control of this or skewing it in a way that basically either

812
00:51:10.881 --> 00:51:15.830
ruins it or prevents it from ever seeing the light of day.

813
00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:20.980
<v 5>I believe in,
I believe that revolutions are not always,</v>

814
00:51:20.981 --> 00:51:24.580
but almost always more destructive than they are productive.

815
00:51:24.581 --> 00:51:25.630
And on the other hand,

816
00:51:25.631 --> 00:51:30.490
I do believe in the power of democracy and ideas if widely disseminated,

817
00:51:30.491 --> 00:51:34.180
thoughtfully engaged with and uh,

818
00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:35.620
widely understood.

819
00:51:36.070 --> 00:51:39.840
I think public understanding is the greatest accountability against,
uh,

820
00:51:39.870 --> 00:51:42.940
it's special interest capture.
So,
um,

821
00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:48.160
I put my faith in that ultimately,
and I hope that young people,

822
00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:53.460
including some people in this room will build on the transmission of different

823
00:51:53.951 --> 00:51:58.951
aspects of these ideas so that we can keep the broad public engaged and,

824
00:51:59.610 --> 00:52:04.300
uh,
uh,
and keep the political process accountable to that.

825
00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:09.130
I think,
you know,
you saw with what happened in the last year or two,

826
00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:11.470
how much desire there is for change,

827
00:52:11.471 --> 00:52:13.990
and if that is channeled in the direction that's productive rather than

828
00:52:13.991 --> 00:52:18.190
destructive,
I think that we have an opportunity to build a much better society.

829
00:52:18.490 --> 00:52:22.680
Uh,
like Franklin Delano Roosevelt,
you know,
I believe did a,

830
00:52:22.690 --> 00:52:27.310
rather than just,
um,
uh,
having a upheaval of island people.

831
00:52:28.690 --> 00:52:30.220
<v 6>Okay.
Thank you very much,
Glenn.</v>

832
00:52:30.330 --> 00:52:30.510
<v 2>Yeah.</v>
