1
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.720
I'm very pleased to welcome you all and to welcome a very esteemed author,

2
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.490
not just an author,
but someone I consider a genuine friend here,

3
00:00:15.491 --> 00:00:16.570
Ryan Williams.

4
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.000
He and I went to university together and he has a very esteemed background,
uh,

5
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.970
that I think a lot of you are familiar with and uh,

6
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.360
and have seen and I'd appreciate it if you all give him a round of applause to

7
00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:29.510
welcome Ryan to the state.

8
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.190
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

9
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.070
<v 0>thank you everyone here.
It's a pleasure to be up in mountain view at Google.</v>

10
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.610
So I'd like to start off by giving y'all self a round of applause for coming out

11
00:00:42.611 --> 00:00:47.290
today and spending some time to talk about influencers.
So get up for yourself.

12
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.890
So this book is called the influencer economy.

13
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.760
It's about how to launch your idea,
share it with the world,

14
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.100
and thrive in the digital age.

15
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.580
So today we'll be thinking about how we can influence others to collaborate,

16
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:09.420
to share ideas,
to help build products people love.

17
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.080
Because ultimately when you collaborate with your community,

18
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.920
your customers and influential leaders in your field,

19
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.650
you become an influencer yourself.

20
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.480
So this all started for me 20 when I was 22 years old.

21
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.890
I'm a former,
uh,
depressed,
uh,

22
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.000
clinically depressed person and I say this because I was 22 living in Washington

23
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.210
DC and you can only imagine what my apartment looked like.

24
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.750
I had beer bottles and soda cans strewn across the floor.

25
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.270
My bed was never made for weeks at a time.

26
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.680
I had dishes all over the kitchen that were stacked up like you couldn't
believe.

27
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.040
I struggled to breathe and I went to my day job is my main outlet in order to

28
00:01:55.231 --> 00:01:57.960
get over the hump of being depressed.

29
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.720
I did what any rational person would do.

30
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.470
I became a standup comedian because why wouldn't you want to be the clinically

31
00:02:06.961 --> 00:02:11.961
depressed standup comedian where your main goal is to make strangers laugh at

32
00:02:13.021 --> 00:02:15.960
comedy clubs with their arms folded,

33
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.400
drunk off flat beer eating greasy chicken wings.

34
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.260
Imagine this scenario with smokey bars in Baltimore,
Washington,

35
00:02:25.261 --> 00:02:27.810
D c where your main goal is to make them laugh.

36
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.490
How do you think of what if you find out a way for it to go,
well,

37
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.420
please let me know.

38
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.770
My parents and my therapist and my now wife who was then my girlfriend at the

39
00:02:37.771 --> 00:02:39.780
time,
they were curious themselves,

40
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.890
but I learned a lot about through standup was putting yourself out there and

41
00:02:43.891 --> 00:02:47.400
dealing with rejection is what makes the experience unique.

42
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.440
And I ultimately pivoted my career.
I listened to the market that told me,
again,

43
00:02:52.441 --> 00:02:54.780
I'll let you be the decider if I was funny or not,

44
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.920
but I ultimately listened to the market and I was a marketing pro.

45
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.050
It's stand up and I can feel amphitheaters and comedy venues and dive bars all

46
00:03:04.361 --> 00:03:09.280
over DC and I'd comedy central Comedians call me up,
texting me saying,

47
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.060
I headline at my show and five people come,

48
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.740
but you can get 250 what's your secrets?
And that's what I realized.

49
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.790
I could pivot my career into marketing and my aspirations of being an artist.

50
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.010
We're going to be put on hold temporarily.

51
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.260
So I left the comedy world and I moved to Los Angeles and I worked at a couple

52
00:03:29.261 --> 00:03:29.891
of companies.

53
00:03:29.891 --> 00:03:34.891
I help raise venture capital and run marketing and as Googlers who here is

54
00:03:34.991 --> 00:03:39.991
familiar with machinima.com we are a multichannel network for those that don't

55
00:03:41.171 --> 00:03:43.330
know we saw,
I see a lot of people are familiar.

56
00:03:43.331 --> 00:03:45.520
We're a gaming network on Youtube,

57
00:03:45.521 --> 00:03:50.521
so think about ESPN for gamers where the sports instead of being football or

58
00:03:50.771 --> 00:03:53.350
soccer,
their call of duty there,

59
00:03:53.351 --> 00:03:57.760
Minecraft and who here has played the game?
Minecraft?
Who,

60
00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.290
here's a better question.
Who's kids are cousins have played Minecraft.
Okay.

61
00:04:02.291 --> 00:04:06.520
More hands have showed up because ultimately Minecraft was a game that we helped

62
00:04:06.521 --> 00:04:11.521
launch at Machinima with no budget and I realized that our sales team was

63
00:04:11.591 --> 00:04:16.210
functioning really well,
but we had no marketing.
So we're young,
we're energetic,

64
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.530
we needed marketing collateral.

65
00:04:17.531 --> 00:04:22.030
We launched our social media and our branding and we hungry team and we were

66
00:04:22.031 --> 00:04:23.800
building this amazing product.
You all,

67
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.540
the majority of the room are technologists here.

68
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.750
So you know the power of building a tech solution of how exciting it is.

69
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.790
So we were acquired by Warner brothers a couple of months ago for $100 million.

70
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.930
And ultimately Machinima was one of the pioneering groups I've ever seen to

71
00:04:37.931 --> 00:04:42.130
galvanize a community because we built our products with the community,

72
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.660
our alpha or Beta,
our launch and our customers like with Minecraft,

73
00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:50.770
which sold for two point $5 billion to Microsoft.

74
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.850
They built it and we help them because we let everyone into the creative
process.

75
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.550
So I was fascinated by influence,
right?

76
00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.550
And the word influencer has been hijacked.

77
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.880
It's been hijacked by a bunch of no talent.
Zeros,

78
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.560
just because you get a bunch of likes on Instagram because you're sexy or these

79
00:05:08.561 --> 00:05:11.920
jeans make you look sexy,
it doesn't matter,
right?

80
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.410
Influencers does not equals followers.

81
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.200
Influencers do not equal impressions.

82
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.500
Influence is something where you want to make a dent in life.

83
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.950
You want to be known.
And if we look back in 20 years,

84
00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.480
Google will exist.
I mean it's up to you all to to keep it in business,

85
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.290
but Google will exist in 20 years and we will Google people's names for

86
00:05:32.291 --> 00:05:35.530
influence and we're not going to find some Instagram celebrity.

87
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.270
We're not going to find someone who looks hot in jeans and was paid $25,000 to

88
00:05:40.271 --> 00:05:43.510
tweet about a product that is not what an influencer is.

89
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.090
So an influencer to me is someone who can create a movement around their idea

90
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.660
through collaboration,
community passion and a shared vision.

91
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.960
It's something connective because ultimately collaboration is where influences

92
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.930
derived and influencers can change a small idea into a world changing one

93
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.600
seemingly overnight because something small become big because influencers can

94
00:06:08.601 --> 00:06:12.590
endorse these ideas and also influences game through collaboration.

95
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:17.570
Often in a niche community like we did at Machinima or we had micro Minecraft

96
00:06:17.571 --> 00:06:20.480
gamers and a very specific game.
We made videos around it,

97
00:06:20.481 --> 00:06:24.800
we built that community and the finally influence has nothing to do with

98
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.910
impressions,

99
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.740
has nothing to do with followers and has nothing to do with any vanity metric.

100
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.410
Then any metrics are not real word metrics.

101
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:38.530
And how I know this is because I did some research because I live in La and

102
00:06:38.991 --> 00:06:43.991
everyone there is obsessed with celebrity and Kim Kardashians and Ryan

103
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.160
Seacrest's are your textbook celebrities.

104
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:51.460
So I went in to their data and what I found was our Machinima influencers could

105
00:06:51.531 --> 00:06:52.364
move the needle.

106
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.270
We had hundreds of thousands of youtube subscribers on these channels and so

107
00:06:56.271 --> 00:06:58.760
people would put,
anyone here,
watch the machine.
I'm a video.

108
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:03.110
It's a bunch of game play.
Oftentimes people narrating over Minecraft.

109
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:04.940
And so imagine like,
you know,

110
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:07.940
instead of watching a football game with the announcers that someone's playing

111
00:07:07.941 --> 00:07:11.660
Minecraft and telling funny stories about their life,
they're called Vlogs,
right?

112
00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.340
Video logs,
they're really big and youtube.

113
00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.750
So these gamers that had hundreds of thousands of subscribers would make videos

114
00:07:17.751 --> 00:07:18.860
playing Minecraft.

115
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:23.960
Just educating people about the world that was in Minecraft and in aggregate

116
00:07:23.961 --> 00:07:28.580
these influencers with less celebrity followers like these mascots up here,

117
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:33.680
they were influencers because in their communities in clusters of five to 10

118
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.740
these influencers move the needle.
And I think,
you know,

119
00:07:36.741 --> 00:07:40.130
people like sea crest people that Kim Kardashian and they add value,

120
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:43.790
they drive traffic.
You know,
they,
people watch their TV shows,

121
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.680
they're cultural taste makers,

122
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:49.910
but they are not true social media influencers because again,

123
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:53.240
the word has been hijacked and they aren't no talent zeros,

124
00:07:53.241 --> 00:07:56.240
like a lot of these influencers on Instagram because they do add value.

125
00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:59.930
But ultimately I want to show you the data around why they're not influential

126
00:07:59.931 --> 00:08:00.764
online.

127
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:06.100
So this is a slide literally I made years ago when I was working doing research

128
00:08:06.261 --> 00:08:09.830
on celebrity investments and startups and how they move the needle.

129
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:10.663
Because again,

130
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:14.250
every silicon valley product they want to connect with a celebrity and a,

131
00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.600
they say,
I want to get someone to tweet about my product.

132
00:08:16.601 --> 00:08:19.280
There'll be an overnight success and that is wrong.

133
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:23.420
Celebrities don't move the needle as much as very targeted specific niche

134
00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:27.410
influencers.
So this is Kim when she had a tweet,
again,

135
00:08:27.411 --> 00:08:31.820
I ripped this directly from a deck I made years ago.
So this is uh,
you know,

136
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:35.030
I mean we're here familiar with bitly,
the data tracking software.

137
00:08:35.031 --> 00:08:36.200
You can use the share links.

138
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:40.520
So she shared an episode of keeping up with the Kardashians to preview an

139
00:08:40.521 --> 00:08:45.521
episode and she got around 83,000 clicks on Twitter,

140
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.140
right?
She has 18 million followers.

141
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:51.770
So that conversion is less than a banner ad would be.

142
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:55.650
Banner ads are terrible.
Like who hear clicks on banner ads on purpose.

143
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.850
Oftentimes I get mad,
right?
Cause I actually click on it and I go back,
go back,

144
00:08:59.851 --> 00:09:00.684
go back.

145
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:05.780
So ultimately the influencers are very niche and targeted and Kim is super

146
00:09:06.031 --> 00:09:10.740
broad.
So here you can see that she's around 0.4,

147
00:09:10.741 --> 00:09:14.430
six of a percent banner ads on average,
around half of a percent.

148
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.660
So you may as well go spend a bunch of money on banner ads if you can spend a

149
00:09:18.661 --> 00:09:21.750
bunch of cash to get Kim Kardashian to tweet about your product,
your,

150
00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:26.140
your club opening in Vegas or anything relevant to her community because she's

151
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.530
abroad celebrity,
she's a mascot.

152
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:32.760
And what's equally fascinating about this data is you notice the decay up here

153
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:36.780
in the first 48 hours is where the bulk of her traffic comes.

154
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:39.030
So nothing is being recycled,

155
00:09:39.031 --> 00:09:43.050
nothing's being circulated amongst other influencer communities to keep this

156
00:09:43.051 --> 00:09:47.130
thriving.
Unlike the Minecraft videos,
which are more timeless,
more evergreen,

157
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:52.080
and more personality driven.
So all this fascinations,

158
00:09:52.081 --> 00:09:55.440
after I left Machinima and I love what we were doing,
those big ideas,

159
00:09:55.441 --> 00:09:56.670
we built the marketing team.

160
00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:00.540
I went on to some other startups and helping them raise capital and do
marketing.

161
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:01.950
But ultimately,

162
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:07.730
I believe that the world is so fascinating right now because you can make a dent

163
00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:12.900
and doing something that you can leave influence around and that ultimately

164
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:17.160
there's a bartering and there was an exchange of ideas and we truly have

165
00:10:17.161 --> 00:10:18.600
navigated a new economy.

166
00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:24.020
So I wrote this book to help us learn how to operate in this new economy and

167
00:10:24.151 --> 00:10:28.230
helping to teach others because learning is really the fundamental of how we

168
00:10:28.231 --> 00:10:32.520
exchange ideas.
And oftentimes giving value is what matters.

169
00:10:32.521 --> 00:10:36.270
And that's how we navigate this new world.
So Seth Godin,

170
00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.630
he's a fellow speaker,
uh,
at Google,

171
00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:42.540
I interviewed over a hundred influencers for my podcast,

172
00:10:42.541 --> 00:10:46.950
which is called stories from the influencer economy because I wanted to build an

173
00:10:46.951 --> 00:10:49.710
idea and a platform ahead of my book launch.

174
00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:53.490
So I talked to Adam Grant who anyone seen his talk here.
It's a really good talk.

175
00:10:53.491 --> 00:10:56.370
Dorie Clark and many other influential business writers.

176
00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:01.470
And I took their application and I applied there old knowledge with new

177
00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.590
influencers in the social media space.
So Seth,

178
00:11:04.591 --> 00:11:08.760
why we'll be talking about him is because he's an influencer.

179
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:12.150
He'll be around in 20 years when you Google his name.

180
00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:16.950
So he talks about a tribe and how a tribe is a group of people connected to one

181
00:11:16.951 --> 00:11:21.480
another,
connected to a leader,
connected to an idea.
For millions of years,

182
00:11:21.481 --> 00:11:24.240
human beings have been part of one tribe or another.
Uh,

183
00:11:24.241 --> 00:11:25.980
group needs only two things to be a tribe,

184
00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.740
a shared interest in a way to communicate.

185
00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.980
Your company at Google is led by tribes.

186
00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.650
Everyone has different teams from research to tech.

187
00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:38.490
You have a tribe leader and you are interested in connecting.

188
00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:42.570
And that's ultimately what happens with storytelling and sharing of ideas and

189
00:11:42.571 --> 00:11:45.060
why someone like Seth is an influencer.

190
00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:51.000
So these are the chapters of the book,
which you all got a in Emoji.

191
00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:53.530
I researched his book ago.

192
00:11:53.531 --> 00:11:56.410
I did this slide to connect with millennials because my,

193
00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:59.890
my parents didn't use Emoji,
but now my parents use Emoji.

194
00:11:59.891 --> 00:12:01.800
So this slide is really for everyone.
Um,

195
00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:06.840
but ultimately the Emoji chapters of the book are how you craft your big vision.

196
00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:10.570
Every influencer I talked to has a big vision,

197
00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.870
a big idea to sell you on something like Sergei and Larry,

198
00:12:13.871 --> 00:12:17.920
years ago they had this big vision to solve a problem because you need buyin

199
00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:22.810
from people to believe in what you're doing.
Secondly is you pick a platform.
You,

200
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.840
I picked a suitcase Emoji here because you've got to pick somewhere you're going

201
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:28.330
and you need to channel so it's no longer,
oh,

202
00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:31.810
I want to go to coffee and pick your brain.
Right?
Those people drive me nuts.

203
00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:35.920
I don't know if you,
sorry if anyone in here does that.
I'm sorry.
Not Sorry.

204
00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:36.980
Actually.
Um,

205
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:40.750
because ultimately you want to collaborate with someone and you pick a channel.

206
00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.880
It could be building an Alpha version of your product.

207
00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:44.530
It could be you make youtube content.

208
00:12:44.531 --> 00:12:48.820
For me it was podcasting and ultimately we are building these relationships

209
00:12:48.821 --> 00:12:51.790
because that's what is currency in the influencer economy.

210
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:56.650
The next thing is a book,
your own gigs.
You have to deal with rejection.

211
00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:00.000
Like Jay Z,
I actually,
this is the only Emoji that I invented.
I thought Jay Z,

212
00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:03.580
you would need an an Emoji.
I mean,
who doesn't,
if anyone earned an Emoji,

213
00:13:03.581 --> 00:13:06.730
it's Jay Z.
Um,
so you got gotta deal with rejection.

214
00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.880
You have to build relationships and you have to accept failure and that you have

215
00:13:09.881 --> 00:13:12.820
to do every job.
And I grew up in des Moines,
Iowa,

216
00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:17.140
and it's known for corn farming.
And I'd like to say never build in a silo,

217
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:19.700
never billed by herself.
The area that,

218
00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:24.160
I mean this company was founded in a garage in,
in Silicon Valley and Stanford.

219
00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:27.760
But that stereotype is over.
People need to build with others.

220
00:13:27.761 --> 00:13:31.240
You have to share because you need psychological and behavioral buyin from

221
00:13:31.241 --> 00:13:34.750
people to help make your idea better and then moreover help spreading it.

222
00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:40.360
The next is a adopt technology early and often influencers are always curious

223
00:13:40.361 --> 00:13:41.230
around technology.

224
00:13:41.231 --> 00:13:44.440
They needed to find tech as a solution and they can't be tech phobics.

225
00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:48.940
The next one is a striving for authenticity and authenticity is a word that's

226
00:13:48.941 --> 00:13:53.470
overused.
I love the word and I hate the word.
Who here likes the word authentic?

227
00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:59.530
We hear it doesn't like the word right?
It's,
it's a very branded word.
It's very,

228
00:13:59.531 --> 00:14:02.920
it's like influencer,
right?
It's been hijacked by a bunch of no talent.
Zeros,

229
00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:07.150
so we're taking it back right now cause authenticity really means having a

230
00:14:07.151 --> 00:14:11.620
strong message and being comfortable in your own skin and being affable,

231
00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:16.690
being likable because you are who you are and ultimately we have flaws and we

232
00:14:16.691 --> 00:14:19.000
have characteristics that we can't always execute on.

233
00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:22.930
I wish I could say that every word coming out today,
we'll be perfect,

234
00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:26.260
but the more likely I am to admit that I'm not perfect,

235
00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:28.660
the more likely I'll be authentic.

236
00:14:28.661 --> 00:14:33.040
And you only know authenticity when you see it.
And then we have collaboration,

237
00:14:33.041 --> 00:14:34.390
which we'll talk about a lot today,

238
00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:38.560
the fist bump capturing lightning in a bottle.
That's something that you know,

239
00:14:38.561 --> 00:14:41.830
like when you double down or you need to pivot with your idea because you have

240
00:14:41.831 --> 00:14:45.070
that moment where you know what your customers are telling you that they either

241
00:14:45.071 --> 00:14:47.380
love it or they want you to go back to the drawing board.

242
00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.170
And then ultimately you got to meet people in real life.

243
00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:53.120
You can't rely on the you people live streaming at home.

244
00:14:53.121 --> 00:14:54.650
Hopefully I'll get to meet you in person,

245
00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:58.580
but ultimately you can't sit back and passively watch things on a laptop.

246
00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:02.210
Influencers and influential people go out and meet people in real life.

247
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:03.830
If I only have to be a giver,

248
00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:06.830
you have to open doors for other people and then you have to give people

249
00:15:06.831 --> 00:15:11.180
ownership of your idea.
You have to let them buy in and celebrate with you,

250
00:15:11.181 --> 00:15:12.470
your wins and your losses.

251
00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:16.820
Because I have a metaphor with Benihana who here has been to a Benihana.

252
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:20.510
You know how they cook the food in front of you and you know they let you into

253
00:15:20.511 --> 00:15:24.560
the creative process and you get to see the chef and they do tricks and you see

254
00:15:24.561 --> 00:15:27.680
what you're about to eat and there's something psychologically fun about that.

255
00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.350
You get to meet people at a table that you don't ordinarily,
no.

256
00:15:30.351 --> 00:15:34.070
I used to celebrate my birthdays there when I was younger growing up in De

257
00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:37.010
Moines,
Iowa and we loved it cause you celebrate with others.

258
00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:41.120
So you have to figure out a way to cook with the community and your customers to

259
00:15:41.121 --> 00:15:41.954
get them to buy in.

260
00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:47.120
So these are the three types of collaboration styles and there's the

261
00:15:47.121 --> 00:15:51.170
collaborators,
this is roughly 10% of your customer and community base.

262
00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.560
These folks are the techies,
what I call the regulars.

263
00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:57.860
They're the ones who build the Alpha and they're going to show up like they

264
00:15:57.861 --> 00:16:01.640
would at a bar drinking with their friends every Friday at happy hour there.

265
00:16:01.641 --> 00:16:04.160
The happy hour crew,
right?
The regulars there,

266
00:16:04.161 --> 00:16:07.310
the one that they're going to buy it when you pilot your program and give it out

267
00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:08.173
at a discount.

268
00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:12.320
Because you need to build these people as your proof of concept and ultimately

269
00:16:12.321 --> 00:16:16.210
they become early adopters.
They become your brand ambassadors.
And for,

270
00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:19.360
for me with my book,
you know,
getting it out to my friends,
my family,

271
00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.290
my email list,
psychologically,

272
00:16:21.291 --> 00:16:24.290
a lot of people wanted to help me because they were part of the process early.

273
00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:25.910
And so these are your collaborators.

274
00:16:25.911 --> 00:16:29.120
They validated because people make mistakes and they want to go to influencers

275
00:16:29.121 --> 00:16:33.830
early and they pitch influencers and they fall on their face because influencers

276
00:16:33.831 --> 00:16:34.664
are the next group.

277
00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:37.840
But you have to build a proof of concept out before you get the key stakeholders

278
00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:41.570
involved.
I use the word key stakeholder because we were at a corporate company,

279
00:16:41.571 --> 00:16:45.280
right.
Can you still isn't key stakeholder like the most corporate word ever.

280
00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:48.620
Like I talk in front of tech entrepreneurs and it never mentioned that word.

281
00:16:48.621 --> 00:16:52.070
So you had home,
just to let you know,
I'm giving it to you as a,

282
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:56.660
as a very a corporate branding here because ultimately I think that the

283
00:16:56.661 --> 00:17:00.080
influencers are the one percenters that you have to have something to offer

284
00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:02.450
before they want to work with you.

285
00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.900
And you don't want to burn that bridge because ultimately they are the industry

286
00:17:05.901 --> 00:17:08.320
leaders.
They're the authorities there,

287
00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:11.450
the one that gives you social proof and they're your lead generators.

288
00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.300
If you find the right influencer to collaborate with.
And again,

289
00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:15.650
don't ask them just for coffee,

290
00:17:15.651 --> 00:17:19.610
ask them to review your Alpha to get feedback to make your product better.

291
00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:22.910
You don't want to ask them to tweet about it,
right?
Cause that's unbecoming.

292
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:24.890
And you also don't ask them for a favor.

293
00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:27.290
You don't want to have someone feel like they owe you something.

294
00:17:27.291 --> 00:17:31.460
Like psychologically influence comes from a win win from the mutual.

295
00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:34.700
You help me,
I help you and we'll talk more about this later,

296
00:17:34.701 --> 00:17:37.570
about giving as a big philosophy for influence.
Um,

297
00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:41.750
and the final step here is the mass marketers.
You know,

298
00:17:41.751 --> 00:17:45.380
people don't care often.
Like if influencers endorse your product,

299
00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:48.260
when someone buys a nest product,
they just care that it works.

300
00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:50.370
They don't care that you had an ambassador program,
that you would,

301
00:17:50.371 --> 00:17:51.300
early adopters,

302
00:17:51.301 --> 00:17:54.570
that you had a bunch of people that give you feedback and you got it in a best

303
00:17:54.571 --> 00:17:58.620
buy.
They just want it at best buy.
And so ultimately the consumers,
the buyers,

304
00:17:58.621 --> 00:18:01.980
the mass market,
they were about 90% of the groups,
right?

305
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:05.270
So you want to build something for them and it's fully baked and they're going

306
00:18:05.271 --> 00:18:06.870
to buy it because it's already established.

307
00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:12.820
So getting into a couple of key principles here of the book,
uh,
this is,
uh,

308
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:15.720
the plot,
the platform or that my father in law's named Joe Moore,

309
00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:20.230
who here is married
of,
of you,
you,

310
00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.930
you know what father in laws are all about.

311
00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:27.030
Sometimes you'll love him sometimes,
whatever the opposite of love is,

312
00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:31.230
that's how you feel.
So my father in law,
he has no idea what I do in California.

313
00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:34.500
He says,
how are these startups valued at a hundreds of millions of dollars?

314
00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:39.480
What do you do to add that value to the company?
Um,
where is that?
Where's the,

315
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:42.750
where's the money coming in?
Because he runs a boy,
the repair company in Raleigh,

316
00:18:42.751 --> 00:18:43.584
North Carolina.

317
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:47.820
So I talked to them about influence and he was really curious about my book and

318
00:18:47.821 --> 00:18:51.660
what I'm working on.
And I said,
you know,
how do you define the word influence?

319
00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:52.830
And he said,
look,

320
00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:56.820
you have to give people something they can't get anywhere else in quite the same

321
00:18:56.821 --> 00:19:01.140
way and you have to solve the pain point.
And he gave me an example of sales.

322
00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:05.460
So he has people calling him up through the southeast for boiler problems.

323
00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.590
He gets some free advice for a half hour,

324
00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:11.610
gives them just enough information that they're dangerous and then not enough

325
00:19:11.611 --> 00:19:14.490
information that they can execute on it because they don't have the resources.

326
00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:17.730
So he says the problem with so many people is they don't know how to solve

327
00:19:17.731 --> 00:19:18.564
problems.

328
00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:22.380
And ultimately that's what happens when you want to gain influence and you're

329
00:19:22.381 --> 00:19:25.080
not helping people,
you're not serving a market demand.

330
00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:28.680
Ultimately you have to develop a knowledge or skill that most people don't have.

331
00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:30.090
And then you share it with them.

332
00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.820
And you build that proof of concept out with your collaborators.

333
00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:36.690
And then ultimately customers come because you've built something that you know,

334
00:19:36.691 --> 00:19:40.440
there's a massive demand for anyone that works in Youtube.

335
00:19:40.441 --> 00:19:44.850
Know who Hannah Hart is.
She's a wonderful human being.

336
00:19:44.851 --> 00:19:49.680
She has a a series called my drunk kitchen and it's,
guess what?

337
00:19:49.681 --> 00:19:54.060
It's about her drinking wine and getting tipsy and making food with her friends.

338
00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:57.450
She's a massive success.
She turned it into a TV show.

339
00:19:57.451 --> 00:20:01.100
She's a best selling book called my drunk kitchen and she's done an amazing job

340
00:20:01.101 --> 00:20:05.280
raising her idea,
but she is an endearing person and she did a hello Hardo tour,

341
00:20:05.281 --> 00:20:08.880
which was a crowdfunding campaign and ultimately with Hershey shared with me

342
00:20:08.881 --> 00:20:13.680
that you give now and people will pay later and you have to hear their problems.

343
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:17.880
So she went out and she galvanized her base because she knew they wanted a tour.

344
00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.460
She went around the country in a,

345
00:20:20.461 --> 00:20:25.350
in a RV and people who crowdfunded her project at a certain threshold where

346
00:20:25.351 --> 00:20:30.150
entered into a lottery and she wants your house and drunk cooked and then made

347
00:20:30.151 --> 00:20:33.950
content around it.
So you were collaborating in her videos.
Um,

348
00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:37.560
who here knows what the term collab means in the youtube ecosystem?

349
00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:40.620
It's not that technical.
It means what you think,

350
00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:45.740
but collabing and youtube is when someone has a video series and let's say,

351
00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:51.280
let's say Payton has a video series about,
um,
building home security systems.

352
00:20:51.281 --> 00:20:53.320
He works at nest,
he's super into this category.

353
00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:57.010
And let's say he has 100000 youtube subscribers.
Really compelling,

354
00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:00.970
Super Compelling Guy,
right?
100,000 subscribers is no small feat.

355
00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:03.310
Let's say the gentleman right here in the green shirt.

356
00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:06.070
Let's say you have a business vlog,

357
00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:10.750
a video log where you talk about ces,
mainstream products,

358
00:21:10.751 --> 00:21:13.990
and let's say a,
what's the name for your channel?
If you had one,

359
00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:19.690
what's an interest of yours?
Food.
What food?

360
00:21:19.691 --> 00:21:24.460
So let's call it a nerd food tech zone.
And you have a million subscribers,

361
00:21:24.461 --> 00:21:28.480
right?
And Peyton with his channel is 100,000.
So you do a Collab,

362
00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:31.990
you appear in his niche channel,
do a video together.

363
00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:36.700
You appear in nerd food,
blog tech,

364
00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:40.000
is that what we call it?
Yeah.
And,
and,

365
00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:43.780
and so you have a massive channel so you collaborate.
There's no money exchanged.

366
00:21:43.781 --> 00:21:45.100
Again,
it's a bartering system.

367
00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:48.850
You want to help make his channel better and get him new subscribers.

368
00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:54.090
But then equally you know that he's very niche and you can appear in his videos

369
00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:58.330
and being a super target segment so you share audience and that bartering,

370
00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:01.750
that collab is really where influence thrives.

371
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:03.760
I get back to the wind when of it all,

372
00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:06.640
you have to find a mutually beneficial way to collaborate with people.

373
00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:07.540
It could be through money,

374
00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:10.390
it could be through equity or it could be through goodwill,

375
00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:14.260
but that's what I learned from all these youtubers and a Brad Feld.

376
00:22:14.261 --> 00:22:16.360
Anyone familiar with Brad?
He started at Tech Stars.

377
00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:19.120
It's a big startup accelerator in Boulder,

378
00:22:19.121 --> 00:22:24.121
Colorado and they essentially give $25,000 to $50,000 to early stage companies

379
00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:27.670
to help them accelerate their ideas.
And Brad,

380
00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:31.630
he talks about how you need to pilot your ideas and piloting or idea.

381
00:22:31.631 --> 00:22:36.100
It comes down to testing something when the barrier to entry is low.

382
00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:41.830
So Brad started blogging at [inaudible] dot com I would say back in oh five

383
00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:42.670
right.

384
00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:46.840
So now he's one of the early adopter tech bloggers and his advice to me was

385
00:22:46.841 --> 00:22:51.100
don't always have a defined goal,
sometimes start something for curiosity's sake.

386
00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:54.310
So he started tech starters,
which is massive incubator and accelerator.

387
00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:59.200
He started it because he could make new friends or he could turn it into $1

388
00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.870
billion business,
but most likely it was going to be somewhere in between.

389
00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:06.370
So he's made new friends and they've invested in thousands of startups and he's

390
00:23:06.371 --> 00:23:08.020
been there for the early stage growth.

391
00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:10.540
He's become a mentor in the startup community.

392
00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:14.560
Even talks about topics like depression,
like he came on my podcast recently,

393
00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:18.640
talked about OCD and depression because he wants to help build communities.

394
00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:22.630
And ultimately piloting or ideas is something where you can workshop when the

395
00:23:22.631 --> 00:23:25.660
stakes are low because of nests breaks down.

396
00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:28.750
People get mad because they paid a lot of money for the product.

397
00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:32.740
But if you're piloting something with the barrier of entry low and you have no

398
00:23:32.741 --> 00:23:35.830
customers,
no one's using it,
you can make those mistakes.

399
00:23:35.831 --> 00:23:40.730
When no one's looking and the bright lights aren't on you.
So these guys are the,

400
00:23:40.731 --> 00:23:41.680
the,
the vlog brothers.

401
00:23:41.681 --> 00:23:45.500
Has anyone seen their work before the vlog brothers or the,

402
00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:49.760
these these guys,
they're a,
essentially they started a conference called Vidcon,

403
00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:52.160
which is a big youtube conference down in Anaheim.

404
00:23:52.161 --> 00:23:55.550
And they started very small and their channel called the vlog brothers.

405
00:23:55.551 --> 00:24:00.551
They do science fiction or science videos and they did one video blog a day to

406
00:24:00.951 --> 00:24:02.900
each other for an entire year.

407
00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:06.710
So they had 365 videos and that's how they got started,
right?
They started small.

408
00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:08.180
So with influence,

409
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:12.780
it's like naming your community is a massive opportunity because they called

410
00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:17.210
their community Nerdfighters and you notice they have the Spock fingers up here

411
00:24:17.211 --> 00:24:21.110
on their,
on their,
uh,
thumbnail because naming and identifying your community,

412
00:24:21.111 --> 00:24:23.990
like your Googlers,
right?
That's a community identifier.

413
00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:28.940
Having a community of people that recognize themselves can help you galvanize

414
00:24:28.941 --> 00:24:33.200
that base and you think about,
you know,
you tubers like youtubers,

415
00:24:33.201 --> 00:24:35.690
that's the people that make the youtube videos and have subscribers.

416
00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:38.330
Like there's a connotation there.
So identifying your customers,

417
00:24:38.331 --> 00:24:42.200
naming them even just internally helps you galvanize that base.

418
00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:45.770
And when you have an idea with the customer in mind,

419
00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.870
oftentimes there's two ways to go about it.

420
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:51.920
One is you find that big vision and then you pick a platform.
So for me,

421
00:24:51.921 --> 00:24:54.410
my big vision,
I'm going to write this influencer economy book.

422
00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:58.040
And I started my podcast to connect with influencers,

423
00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:01.790
to connect with audiences because I'm a former standup and I love doing that and

424
00:25:01.791 --> 00:25:03.980
to help tell stories so people can learn.

425
00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:07.610
But sometimes influencers and people that are influential,

426
00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:11.570
they start small with a Vlog and that turns into vidcon years later.

427
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:13.700
And these guys are brilliant.
Branders.

428
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.480
One of their catchphrases is don't forget to be awesome.

429
00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:21.980
Like that's assuming you're already awesome and they're reminding you not to

430
00:25:21.981 --> 00:25:22.814
forget it.

431
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.450
So I think that's a wonderful way to think about how to build that relationship

432
00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.640
is you got to brand your ideas creatively.

433
00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:32.750
And that's really where the authenticity comes into play.
So,
uh,

434
00:25:32.751 --> 00:25:36.140
another Youtuber I love is this guy named Freddie Wong.

435
00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:40.280
And it's funny cause a lot of people,
they don't know who he is,

436
00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:44.120
but if I ever have like anyone under the age of 16 in the crowd,

437
00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:48.020
they love this guy.
He did a series called video game high school,

438
00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:52.340
which is like a Harry Potter for Video Games where in the future you all have

439
00:25:52.341 --> 00:25:53.000
seen it.

440
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.230
Like in the future there's a gaming academies and these professional gaming

441
00:25:57.231 --> 00:25:59.960
academies are going to help save the world.
It's amazing.

442
00:25:59.961 --> 00:26:04.961
It's been viewed a billion times online and he's crowdfunded three campaigns for

443
00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:10.400
$2 million.
He was crowdfunding before spike Lee did it,
you know,

444
00:26:10.401 --> 00:26:14.750
before Veronica Mars and before all these mainstream Zach Braff projects were on

445
00:26:14.751 --> 00:26:18.590
Kickstarter and I loved how he used technology to his advantage.

446
00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:22.640
He figured out a way to leverage tech and be an early adopter,

447
00:26:22.641 --> 00:26:25.920
a mass youtube subscribers back when youtube wasn't even monetize bubble.

448
00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:30.510
And He makes Scifi videos that people love and his crowd funding campaign

449
00:26:30.511 --> 00:26:34.700
shattered records because ultimately Freddie had these amazing perks.

450
00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:35.901
So I would take it,

451
00:26:35.901 --> 00:26:40.650
most people at Google have supported a crowdfunding campaign and I love crowd

452
00:26:40.651 --> 00:26:43.650
funding campaigns,
right?
Because they give you updates continually.

453
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:48.360
And so Freddy's perks define the accessibility of people with influence for

454
00:26:48.361 --> 00:26:49.410
$5,000.

455
00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:53.220
He had a perk where you could go with the cast and crew of video game high

456
00:26:53.221 --> 00:26:56.790
school to Disney for the day.
All you had to do was get to Anaheim.

457
00:26:57.150 --> 00:27:00.210
And then he would spend the whole day on rollercoaster rides and space mountain

458
00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:03.360
with Freddie and his buddies that are in your favorite web series.

459
00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:05.850
He had another one for 3,500,
I believe,

460
00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:09.990
where he would deliver fried dough out to your front door,

461
00:27:09.991 --> 00:27:14.430
anywhere in the country
or the local equivalent if you didn't have fried dough.

462
00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:15.450
So glazed donuts.

463
00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:20.430
And so luckily he said that it was a person in New Jersey who started that,

464
00:27:20.431 --> 00:27:24.570
uh,
that bought that perk.
So he's in New York and he shifted over for work.

465
00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:28.740
But ultimately that kind of cleverness,
right?
Leveraging the technology.

466
00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:29.850
Can you imagine,

467
00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:33.810
what would Steven Spielberg even say to you if he was on your door?
Like,

468
00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:35.190
sorry Steven if you're watching,

469
00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:40.470
but I mean I asked the broader question is the celebrity is a broad person with

470
00:27:40.471 --> 00:27:44.700
influence but Freddy is on your mobile device,
he's on your laptop,

471
00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:46.200
he's on your iPad,

472
00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:50.820
he's someone that you have a connected relationship with because he's truly

473
00:27:50.821 --> 00:27:54.720
influential and you're collaborating with them.
I think everyone needs to just,

474
00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.210
if you haven't done a crowdfunding campaign and you're watching this,

475
00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:01.350
just support one cause those emails you get even when they are late and the

476
00:28:01.351 --> 00:28:03.920
project's overdue there with love and the,

477
00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:07.800
and you buy something and you preorder it because you buy in and back it.

478
00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:11.760
I think the backing of mentality is how marketers win in the new economy.

479
00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:16.380
You have to think of your customers as backers and let them drive to a larger

480
00:28:16.381 --> 00:28:20.310
goal or you give them a vision and say,
I'm going to execute on this.

481
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:22.920
I'll let you in on something.
When I launched my book,

482
00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:27.390
I had a an email list and some friends that I sent the book out to for free.

483
00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:30.120
And it's relevant because I used a Google doc,

484
00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:35.160
so I know my audience and I love Google docs,
right?
So I sent it out and I said,

485
00:28:35.161 --> 00:28:37.290
if you give me an edit for the book,

486
00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:40.680
and this is like months before I was going to launch it,

487
00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:44.190
if you give me any feedback if I use it or not,

488
00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:46.530
I'll give you an editor title in my book.

489
00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:50.520
And I learned that from crowdfunding campaigns because I saw people that were,

490
00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:54.000
you could become an executive producer for video series and movies if you

491
00:28:54.001 --> 00:28:58.140
donated a certain amount of money.
And my wife said,
that's a terrible idea,

492
00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:00.180
why would you give your book out for free?

493
00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:05.550
And what I learned was it was the best idea could have patched because the

494
00:29:05.551 --> 00:29:09.060
people that left me the comments made my book better and I pivoted part of it

495
00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:13.500
and it actually had more actions and lessons for people to learn from.
Moreover,

496
00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:18.620
the first people to buy my book at launch and leave reviews on books sites were

497
00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:24.300
my first creditors and they all got in the book.

498
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:27.570
So psychologically they built it with me.
I mean I have a Gmail account,

499
00:29:27.571 --> 00:29:30.510
which is pretty much my name.
I'm not going to give it out to everyone,

500
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:32.460
but because I was an early adopter,
right?

501
00:29:32.461 --> 00:29:36.090
And people love getting access early and if you could figure out a way to

502
00:29:36.091 --> 00:29:38.160
psychologically make people feel part of the process,

503
00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:43.240
then you're going to be a winner.
So how's everyone doing?
We go with everyone.

504
00:29:43.241 --> 00:29:47.170
Did,
we're up some questions afterwards.
So do you have questions?
Even now,

505
00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:51.250
as long as you ask them politely.
Um,
you know,
please.
I used to stand up comedy,

506
00:29:51.251 --> 00:29:54.400
so this was a warmer crowd than dive bars in Baltimore.

507
00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:58.770
There's a smoky haze because it's non smoking in this room.
Um,

508
00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:03.700
it's a couple more examples as the giver mentality.
Uh,
Adam Grant,

509
00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:07.270
has he spoken to Google?
Have you seen his work?
Give and take?

510
00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:08.950
It's a phenomenal book.

511
00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:12.040
Give and take you out as a Wharton professor and a business consultant.

512
00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:17.340
He talks about how give her succeed more in life and takers.
Uh,

513
00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:19.510
you obviously know who they are,
right?

514
00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:22.990
They take the most in life and most of us are matchers,

515
00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:25.300
givers,
takers and matchers.

516
00:30:25.301 --> 00:30:29.110
And matchers are people that you helped me quid pro quo.
You scratch my back,

517
00:30:29.111 --> 00:30:31.570
I scratch your back.
You want to collaborate with those people,
right?

518
00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:37.050
But givers succeed the most and they failed the most because you need to give

519
00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:42.240
with your own self interest aligned and you want to give with your own interest

520
00:30:42.241 --> 00:30:46.360
because why give for the sake of giving because you get taken advantage of.

521
00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:50.770
And that's truly remarkable.
I wrote an article,
um,
about why,
you know,

522
00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:53.770
giving and helping others without expecting anything in return is the best

523
00:30:53.771 --> 00:30:56.950
business model for life.
And I threw it up on the website.
Um,

524
00:30:56.980 --> 00:31:01.980
medium.com it's a blog engine and it's already getting surfaced and it made its

525
00:31:02.621 --> 00:31:03.454
way to Adam.

526
00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:08.260
And I ended up getting an email introduction to him because I wrote this
article.

527
00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:11.860
And oftentimes putting yourself out there,
taking a chance,

528
00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:14.200
even if it's a blog post that no one's going to read,

529
00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:19.060
like I registered influencer economy.com years ago and multiple companies ago.

530
00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:22.690
I knew I was never gonna be able to write the book when I had a crazy intense

531
00:31:22.691 --> 00:31:26.090
job.
But I bookmarked it.
I wrote a blog post why I wanted to,

532
00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:29.650
I wanted Google Seo as well because I don't want people searching influencer

533
00:31:29.651 --> 00:31:31.870
economy and having a Gawker media post.

534
00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:37.000
But I ultimately did it because it was a reminder to keep this project going

535
00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:40.420
because life gets in the way and at Google maybe some of your products get

536
00:31:40.421 --> 00:31:42.520
sidled or put on the back burner.

537
00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:45.760
But ultimately that blog post really helps you identify where you stand.

538
00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:50.440
And a,
this is a guy named Troy Carter who I talked to.

539
00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:54.760
He's a Easter managed lady.
Gaga is a wonderful guy.

540
00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:59.260
He managed Lady Gaga and Eve the Rapper,
Biggie smalls,

541
00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:02.800
Aka notorious pig for those playing at home.

542
00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:07.420
And he was a club promoter back in the day and now he's gone on to invest in

543
00:32:07.421 --> 00:32:11.260
companies like Uber and Lyft and Dropbox as an angel investor.

544
00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:15.070
And we talked about pivoting with him cause he wanted to be a hip hop artist.

545
00:32:15.071 --> 00:32:18.160
His goal,
he grew up in west Philadelphia,
born and raised.

546
00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:22.150
So of course his idols were the fresh prince and Jazzy Jeff.

547
00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:26.230
So we pitched them in their studio after stocking them for a couple days,

548
00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:27.573
maybe weeks.

549
00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:31.480
And he realized his passion was in behind the scenes producing and managing

550
00:32:31.481 --> 00:32:32.314
talent.

551
00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:36.850
So he told me that you need to have that personal internal gauge to tell you

552
00:32:36.851 --> 00:32:37.870
when it's time to pivot.

553
00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:42.890
And people may not know that Twitter was originally a podcast network.

554
00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:45.020
Twitter was a podcast that we're called Odeo,

555
00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:48.950
but they realize at the time that apple was going to dominate the podcasting

556
00:32:48.951 --> 00:32:52.310
landscape.
Uh,
Instagram was originally a,

557
00:32:52.311 --> 00:32:55.370
a checking device like foursquare where you could tell people your location,

558
00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:59.120
but they got the market feedback and they pivoted to make the idea better.

559
00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:02.810
And ultimately pivoting comes down to moments in your career or with your

560
00:33:02.811 --> 00:33:06.510
products.
But with Troy,
I asked him,
you know,

561
00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:10.580
how do you go from being a talent manager and the music industry to being a

562
00:33:10.581 --> 00:33:14.870
prolific angel investor in tech companies?
And he told me it was really funny.

563
00:33:14.871 --> 00:33:18.920
He said,
well,
there's curiosity because I thought,

564
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:23.090
I want to know if there was life on Mars in Silicon Valley as a music executive.

565
00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:27.410
And they want to know if there was life on Mars is a music industry veteran.

566
00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:29.330
And there was a mutual curiosity.

567
00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:33.050
And he waited a year before he even did an investment because he wanted to

568
00:33:33.051 --> 00:33:35.540
survey the landscape.
So pivoting doesn't mean just,
Hey,

569
00:33:35.541 --> 00:33:39.110
I'm going to stop what I'm doing and actually changed my tracks.

570
00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:43.670
It means I'm going to enhance what I'm doing and leverage my opportunities and

571
00:33:43.671 --> 00:33:47.510
build on my network because I have established myself in one field and I can

572
00:33:47.511 --> 00:33:49.860
transition that into another.
Um,

573
00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:55.090
so that is what we're sharing today and the influencer economy with a how to

574
00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:59.200
launch and collaborate and thrive.
And a,

575
00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:04.260
this is the part where I talk about some pun related to stand up comedy because

576
00:34:04.431 --> 00:34:07.960
people always say you need to tie it back to comedy.
So,
um,

577
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.000
I'll just give you one example of what I learned through to stand up was that

578
00:34:13.401 --> 00:34:14.990
you always got to finish your set.

579
00:34:15.890 --> 00:34:20.210
That was the hardest part was when I was doing sets at open mics or at the,

580
00:34:20.211 --> 00:34:24.320
at the improv where I reached my peak was you always have your uh,

581
00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:25.760
your setlist on a cocktail Napkin,

582
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.180
whether you're drinking a beer or water and you have your jokes,
you know,

583
00:34:29.181 --> 00:34:32.930
bands have it as well on stage and they have their set down.

584
00:34:33.290 --> 00:34:35.000
And I got heckled so hard,

585
00:34:35.001 --> 00:34:37.790
this dive bar in Baltimore that people were calling it like,

586
00:34:37.791 --> 00:34:42.260
look at me and think of any like insult that stereotypically you could like make

587
00:34:42.261 --> 00:34:45.890
for me.
And that's what they gave me and I gave up on my set.

588
00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:50.150
And that's what the advice I'd give to anyone with stand up comedy or writing a

589
00:34:50.151 --> 00:34:55.151
book or launching a product is never get deterred and always follow your methods

590
00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:58.220
and your philosophy and finish your set.

591
00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:00.140
Cause even if you get through it and you bomb,

592
00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:02.240
there's always the next gig that you can go to.

593
00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:06.620
The thank you very much for checking this out today.

594
00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:13.043
<v 1>I'd love to hear,</v>

595
00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:17.880
so you just a little bit about how you've maybe shared some of those same

596
00:35:17.881 --> 00:35:21.900
principles,
uh,
that you walked us through,
but in your life,

597
00:35:21.901 --> 00:35:23.760
like how have you applied some of this Ryan?

598
00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:27.370
<v 0>Yeah,
so for starters,
you know,
I mentioned I have a podcast.</v>

599
00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:29.860
If you thought if it was present day,

600
00:35:29.861 --> 00:35:34.330
I would not start a podcast right now because it's so competitive and noisy.

601
00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:38.370
But when I started it three years ago,
I was an early adopter and I was,

602
00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:42.330
it was unique so I could lay in a lot of a plus interviews with people like Seth

603
00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:46.200
Godin or Brad Feld.
Then I couldn't get unless I had been an early adopter.

604
00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:50.550
And so that was a characteristic that I realized that I was fortunate to have

605
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.140
and that all these influential people I interviewed always thought about tech to

606
00:35:55.141 --> 00:35:55.974
enable them.

607
00:35:56.250 --> 00:36:00.780
And then equally having that platform of a podcast could get me in the door with

608
00:36:00.781 --> 00:36:03.870
people that ordinarily may not be interested in what I'm working on.

609
00:36:03.871 --> 00:36:04.920
Because as you,
as you know,

610
00:36:04.921 --> 00:36:09.330
I worked at Machinima and these big startups and all these companies maybe

611
00:36:09.331 --> 00:36:13.200
you've never even heard of.
And so why would these influential people talk to me?

612
00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:17.250
But I pitched him on this big vision with the book and who doesn't want to be on

613
00:36:17.251 --> 00:36:18.810
a book in a book,
right?

614
00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:22.980
And then also I had a podcast I'm going to edit meticulously and it's on Itunes,

615
00:36:22.981 --> 00:36:25.620
they can share it with their friends and who doesn't want to talk about

616
00:36:25.621 --> 00:36:26.880
themselves for 45 minutes.

617
00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:30.990
So those two elements really are got reinforced as I kept,
you know,

618
00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:32.520
doing the research for the book.

619
00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:38.550
So how did you make people come to the basketball games?
Um,

620
00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:43.520
so the,
so what this group was an insurgent group.
For those of you that's,

621
00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:47.580
you know,
study marketing.
It's always good to have an enemy,
right?

622
00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:50.100
Google started off with an enemy.

623
00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:55.470
My enemy in this PowerPoint is celebrities like Kim Kardashian and sea crest.

624
00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:59.340
And so our enemy is actually where the memorial maniacs,
they were.

625
00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:03.060
They were this group,
uh,
they did things by the book,
let's just say that.

626
00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:08.600
And so the Psychos is the group I started and I stole the movie font from the

627
00:37:08.671 --> 00:37:11.460
movie and it's put it on a tee shirt.
And then Hitchcock,

628
00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:15.420
he's known for his outline,
has a soliloquy outline.

629
00:37:15.421 --> 00:37:19.620
So I took an Cornelius Vanderbilt silhouette and I put on the back of the t

630
00:37:19.621 --> 00:37:23.100
shirt and I was the anti memorial mania back.
We're going to have fun.

631
00:37:23.101 --> 00:37:27.420
We're in a parties before and after and I made it more of an experience.

632
00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:30.090
So win or lose,
you had that connected community.

633
00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:34.470
And also we went to school with a lot of fragmented fraternities and sororities

634
00:37:34.471 --> 00:37:35.730
and different organizations.

635
00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:39.540
So this was like a neutral party and location where we could all get together

636
00:37:39.541 --> 00:37:40.800
and rally and yell.

637
00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:43.860
And our team ultimately didn't even make the NCA tournament when I started it.

638
00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:47.580
But I think having that community and that connectivity with others,
maybe,

639
00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:51.190
I think a lot of people want to meet folks outside of their network.
That's why,

640
00:37:51.191 --> 00:37:51.340
you know,

641
00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:54.930
Twitter and Facebook and all these communities exist in some ways because you

642
00:37:54.931 --> 00:37:56.070
want to go out of network.

643
00:37:56.370 --> 00:37:59.370
It's like helping people meet other folks that they wouldn't have met in college

644
00:37:59.371 --> 00:38:02.550
was actually a big part of it.
And the basketball was secondary.

645
00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:07.560
It was really the community part of it.
Nice recall.
I like the,
uh,
that question.

646
00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:11.880
So do you tend to have one project you focus on at a time or do you tend to have

647
00:38:11.881 --> 00:38:16.770
several projects going at once?
I have lots of products going at once.

648
00:38:16.771 --> 00:38:21.120
I think,
like I learned from Brad Feld about piloting your ideas,
you know,

649
00:38:21.121 --> 00:38:23.880
I'll get on as long as it doesn't take up too much time.

650
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:27.940
Like I prioritize my podcasts,
my book,
my consulting business.
Um,

651
00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:31.890
I've a online course that I turned the book.
I'm inspired by the book,

652
00:38:31.891 --> 00:38:35.710
actually someone from the crowd when I,
one of my book tour the summer,
he said,

653
00:38:35.711 --> 00:38:37.870
hey,
you should put this into an online course.

654
00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:41.710
And so I just transferred all the data into a video series.

655
00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:46.750
And ultimately I feel like the strength I've found is to be influential as if

656
00:38:46.751 --> 00:38:48.670
you can repurpose your message.

657
00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:53.140
There's a book called making ideas happen by guy named Scott Belsky.

658
00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:55.360
He started up a hance that was acquired by Adobe.

659
00:38:56.050 --> 00:38:58.640
He talks about how you need to have,
um,

660
00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:02.320
be agnostic to the platform but be mission centric.

661
00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:05.710
So your mission should always be true to anything you do,

662
00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:08.770
whether it's writing a book,
a podcast,
your consulting business,

663
00:39:08.771 --> 00:39:10.960
a course or any products you make.

664
00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:14.470
And that's a great way to help you prioritize what to focus on.

665
00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:17.980
Because if you start going outside of your lane,
then you can realize that,
hey,

666
00:39:17.981 --> 00:39:21.910
maybe I'm veering off too much,
but I believe strongly about piloting new ideas.

667
00:39:21.911 --> 00:39:24.430
Even if you write a blog post that no one reads,

668
00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:27.880
but it got something off your chest and makes you feel better and you can share

669
00:39:27.881 --> 00:39:30.670
it to five people in your network,
then there's value in that.

670
00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:35.620
<v 1>Um,
this is a topic that a lot of people talk about and I just think that,</v>

671
00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:38.710
you know,
there's a lot of like real content.
They're very,
very interesting.

672
00:39:38.711 --> 00:39:42.730
Thank you for that.
Um,
on your point about metrics.

673
00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:45.100
So,
um,
you know,

674
00:39:45.101 --> 00:39:48.670
reality is a lot of those social networks and the places in which people

675
00:39:48.671 --> 00:39:52.630
congregate on the Internet are all about subscribers,
likes and things like that.

676
00:39:52.631 --> 00:39:56.910
Right?
Then you said that this doesn't necessarily mean whether or not you are a,

677
00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:57.940
an important influencer,

678
00:39:58.390 --> 00:40:02.200
but I guess for people who are arriving at any piece of content from the
outside,

679
00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:05.170
that's the only thing they have on moment zero.
Right,
right.
So guys,

680
00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:09.440
it becomes the Ito's a little bit,
uh,
in a certain way.
So how do,

681
00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:12.160
how do break desires when you're starting out and you know you're,

682
00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:15.820
you have something good to offer but we're going to have to be faced with this

683
00:40:15.821 --> 00:40:18.790
rejection at first we,
with our low numbers.

684
00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:23.200
<v 0>Oh yeah.
You're going to be re wholeheartedly rejected at first.
Yeah.
I,</v>

685
00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:27.630
I've seen a lot of people through the course of my career that they build this

686
00:40:27.631 --> 00:40:32.190
amazing thing and it's like a empty house when they launch it and they're like,

687
00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:33.360
say,
where are the customers?

688
00:40:33.361 --> 00:40:37.020
I thought people would buy my book or download my product and they don't realize

689
00:40:37.021 --> 00:40:41.040
that you consistently have to be in a phase of relaunching and that you pivot

690
00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:41.970
and he listened to the market.

691
00:40:41.971 --> 00:40:45.330
You get the feedback and then you relaunch the Internet has an incredibly short

692
00:40:45.331 --> 00:40:49.530
memory.
Write things,
mistakes we made at Machinima on Youtube.

693
00:40:49.590 --> 00:40:52.290
We could just take the video down.
People forget,

694
00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:56.070
imagine the inundation of information we get through social media every day.

695
00:40:56.490 --> 00:41:00.900
People make mistakes,
you own it and you move on.
And I think ultimately,
you know,

696
00:41:00.901 --> 00:41:05.220
perseverance is really like you have to have a bigger vision because you can get

697
00:41:05.221 --> 00:41:08.490
lost in the weeds.
Like if you start a pilot,
a project,

698
00:41:08.491 --> 00:41:11.460
let's say you're writing a blog and there's no bigger purpose,

699
00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:13.320
then you're going to lose focus.

700
00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:16.920
So if you can tie it into a longer term opportunity for yourself and say,

701
00:41:16.921 --> 00:41:19.170
this is a channel,
this is a platform.

702
00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:23.550
I'm building an Alpha prototype for a product and I want to get to Beta because

703
00:41:23.551 --> 00:41:26.640
that's going to get me to launch and doing smaller milestones for a bigger

704
00:41:26.641 --> 00:41:27.090
vision.

705
00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:31.200
I feel like wrapping those two up together is a recipe for success because

706
00:41:31.201 --> 00:41:34.400
ultimately it's so easy to lose focus because we're incredibly busy.

707
00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:36.530
And so if you don't have a bigger mission or purpose,

708
00:41:36.531 --> 00:41:38.180
and sometimes that takes time to discover,

709
00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:41.930
and if you don't just put yourself out there,
then you'll never know.

710
00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:43.550
And so if you start something now,
you know,

711
00:41:43.551 --> 00:41:46.730
getting back to your part of your question about making it pop or making it

712
00:41:46.731 --> 00:41:51.050
successful,
it's really fighting that validation.
Like with my podcast,
you know,

713
00:41:51.051 --> 00:41:55.300
I've had some fairly well known people that I didn't invite on the show,

714
00:41:55.610 --> 00:41:59.390
episode number three's guest.
And I built up 25 episodes.

715
00:41:59.391 --> 00:42:01.160
And then I knew,
you know,

716
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:05.500
Willie geist who's host of the today show from college and I reached out to him

717
00:42:05.501 --> 00:42:08.670
at episode 25 and I said,
I have this ballad,
you know,

718
00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:12.440
audience I have actually,
right?
I started writing the book.

719
00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:15.020
And so don't go after influencers too early.

720
00:42:15.350 --> 00:42:20.350
It's like they can really help like jet fuel to get your product to market in an

721
00:42:20.721 --> 00:42:23.960
accelerated way.
And then equally once they're there,
like,

722
00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:26.570
make sure your website doesn't crash,
make sure your product doesn't break.

723
00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:30.470
Like I was on the front page of Reddit with one of my podcasts and I have,
uh,

724
00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:34.730
have,
uh,
uh,
children and I was like walking my kid down the street and I see her,

725
00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:37.490
this woman's tweet and she's part of a community called rooster teeth,

726
00:42:37.491 --> 00:42:38.600
which is a youtube network.

727
00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:43.250
She tweets out my link and I'm like freaking out on my kid and you know,

728
00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:46.370
pushing her down the street.
And I like ran home and was just like,

729
00:42:46.371 --> 00:42:50.120
what's going on here?
Like my website stable because I got that search.

730
00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:53.750
And so really having the technology proved out and if your website breaks,

731
00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:54.740
that's a great problem to have.

732
00:42:55.720 --> 00:43:00.010
<v 3>So your presentation is focused on like consumer goods and performances and</v>

733
00:43:00.011 --> 00:43:02.760
things that mostly or uh,

734
00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:03.893
<v 0>you know,</v>

735
00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:06.060
<v 3>products being marketed out there to people.</v>

736
00:43:06.210 --> 00:43:08.370
What about for things like political mindshare?

737
00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:11.850
Could the same general ideas and concepts be,
uh,

738
00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:13.950
applied to something like a political campaign?

739
00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:15.163
<v 0>Absolutely.</v>

740
00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:19.910
I think getting into the heart of the matter with a finding problems and

741
00:43:19.911 --> 00:43:22.760
people's needs.
So politics is interesting in two ways.

742
00:43:22.761 --> 00:43:27.761
One is how you reach people during the campaign season to find their problems,

743
00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:32.150
to then make them feel heard.
And Sam working on this,

744
00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:33.470
I'm solving this problem with you.

745
00:43:33.471 --> 00:43:37.400
I think that the most phenomenal tech campaign or a political campaigns are run

746
00:43:37.401 --> 00:43:39.410
like a tech product,
right?

747
00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:42.830
Where you do gathering and surveys and you build the Alpha,

748
00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:44.720
you build that core community of people.

749
00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:47.630
They're going to help you reach a critical mass and then you,

750
00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:50.630
you'll reach out to swing states if you're running the presidents and you have

751
00:43:50.631 --> 00:43:53.570
to make a message that goes a little bit more mainstream in most cases.

752
00:43:54.110 --> 00:43:58.100
But ultimately that core community of people whose problems you're solving is

753
00:43:58.101 --> 00:44:01.250
what's gonna get you there.
Like can you like student debt,
right?

754
00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:04.010
For college graduates,
that's a huge problem.

755
00:44:04.011 --> 00:44:07.490
60 million people are affected by it.
So if you run for president,

756
00:44:07.491 --> 00:44:11.330
that's a great market to address and figure out a way to solve that problem with

757
00:44:11.331 --> 00:44:12.170
that community.

758
00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:17.090
Like you would building a product at Google and then secondarily how bills get

759
00:44:17.091 --> 00:44:21.320
passed and how the back and forth having open forums,

760
00:44:21.321 --> 00:44:26.210
town halls to get feedback on bills that you want to pass and have ideas.

761
00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:29.840
And I look at it like if you have a hundred people that give you advice from a

762
00:44:29.841 --> 00:44:33.630
random sample set,
if you get one big idea from that group,

763
00:44:33.631 --> 00:44:35.280
it's entirely worth it,
right?

764
00:44:35.281 --> 00:44:39.480
And it gets people involved so they can help you transcend the message to other

765
00:44:39.481 --> 00:44:44.010
folks to get them on board.
And I look at actually passing bills as it,
you know,

766
00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:45.240
with a tech angle as well.

767
00:44:45.241 --> 00:44:50.100
And that we'd be better served with Congress in passing trans with transparency,

768
00:44:50.101 --> 00:44:54.510
listening to people's needs,
truly collaborating with the community.
And ideally,

769
00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:58.470
you know,
both sides of the aisle.
I was just wondering,
your Bogan,

770
00:44:58.530 --> 00:45:02.700
Amazon has a 200 reviews and all of them five stars.
How did you do that?

771
00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:07.920
Um,
so,
uh,
thank you for checking out the reviews.

772
00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:14.010
They're not vanity metrics,
they're real world metrics,
right?
So I uh,

773
00:45:14.011 --> 00:45:15.990
I'll tell you,
I'll tell you,
uh,
just the truth,

774
00:45:15.991 --> 00:45:20.640
like I was approached by a friend who was an author and a,

775
00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:24.330
I don't know if I should be admitting this,
but he said,
if you,
I self published,

776
00:45:24.610 --> 00:45:25.740
he said,
if you want a publisher,

777
00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:31.070
then you need a hundred Amazon reviews because that's the 1% or of books on

778
00:45:31.201 --> 00:45:34.260
Amazon.
So 1% of all books have a hundred reviews.

779
00:45:34.530 --> 00:45:38.490
So you said you'll have that social proof if you actually,
uh,

780
00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:41.100
get a hundred reviews and then I'll introduce you to my agent.
And you know,

781
00:45:41.101 --> 00:45:44.220
the rest is history.
So the book's gonna come out next year,

782
00:45:44.221 --> 00:45:48.810
we're translating it into Korea.
Uh,
I went to Korean like simultaneously.

783
00:45:48.811 --> 00:45:52.770
And so a hundred reviews is a huge stress hold.
So I would barter with people.

784
00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:55.500
And if you came to my book event this summer and Raleigh,

785
00:45:55.501 --> 00:45:59.430
North Carolina and I'm signing books and you have a long line of people that are

786
00:45:59.431 --> 00:46:02.280
asking in depth questions,
I would say,
look,

787
00:46:02.281 --> 00:46:06.240
if you leave me an Amazon review,
if you honestly,
you know,
read the book,

788
00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:10.470
I will give you a free Skype consultation when I got back to La.
Right?

789
00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:13.140
So I would barter with people and they would give me amazing feedback on the

790
00:46:13.141 --> 00:46:13.974
book too.

791
00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:18.300
I look up a book like software and I'll publish 2.0 next year and you know,

792
00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:22.020
I'll use that feedback as part of the experience because people have told me how

793
00:46:22.021 --> 00:46:25.530
I could make it better.
And so I found hooks like that where you know,

794
00:46:25.531 --> 00:46:28.950
people like I'm on the board of my kid's preschool and a bunch of people bought

795
00:46:28.951 --> 00:46:30.960
the book and there's that phrase,

796
00:46:30.961 --> 00:46:34.530
just ask like no one knows the Amazon reviews or currency.

797
00:46:34.830 --> 00:46:38.100
They don't know that it's a bartering economy and that that matters to people

798
00:46:38.101 --> 00:46:40.290
like me that are really getting the word out there.

799
00:46:40.291 --> 00:46:43.250
And the fact that it was noticeable,
you know,
a Korean publisher,

800
00:46:43.251 --> 00:46:46.680
I had four people from Korea reached out to me in three weeks and I imagine

801
00:46:46.681 --> 00:46:49.590
those reviews really mattered cause cause you can get social proof from the

802
00:46:49.591 --> 00:46:51.720
community,
right?
Not just influencers.

803
00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:55.860
If you have 1 million youtube subscribers and a bunch of Amazon reviews.

804
00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:59.790
So I really bartered with people because no one understood really from my

805
00:46:59.791 --> 00:47:02.820
friends,
the people that would see it.
So anyone listening now,
please.

806
00:47:02.821 --> 00:47:04.680
If you leave an Amazon review,
honestly,

807
00:47:04.681 --> 00:47:07.950
there'll be a amazing and email me and tell me what you think about the book,

808
00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:13.230
because you have to open yourself up to criticism and the reviews actually are

809
00:47:13.290 --> 00:47:16.260
solid because it was the right focus group,
you know,

810
00:47:16.261 --> 00:47:21.060
with the core community of people who want to read this type of content.
Cool.

811
00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:22.110
Thank you very much.

812
00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:24.530
<v 2>Yeah,
thank you.
Thank you.
