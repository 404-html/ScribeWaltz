1
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.970
And it gives me great pleasure to introduce our speaker and I'm mcanulty

2
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.590
hands up if you're incredibly excited about this session over the next 50

3
00:00:22.591 --> 00:00:27.570
minutes or so.
No vrs,
stay less.
Mom was here 15 minutes early.

4
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.140
Hands up.
Who doesn't really know what to experience?
You're going,

5
00:00:31.141 --> 00:00:32.720
what the hell is this all about?

6
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.480
So how many of you would say you just don't really know what to expect?

7
00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:40.020
Hands up nice and hey,
please expect fun.

8
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.600
Please expect a lot of energy.

9
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.520
Please expect a lot of interaction and please expect to be inspired about your

10
00:00:47.521 --> 00:00:49.110
potential.
Is that fair enough?

11
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.180
I'm going to give you a little snapshot just for up by 10 seconds and they're

12
00:00:54.181 --> 00:00:58.740
going to get everybody in this room rocking.
The Snapshot Is,

13
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.750
I'm trying to fit into about 40 minutes now.
What I've learned in 25 years,

14
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.980
I find that a massive challenge.
So what?
I'm incredibly excited,

15
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.560
but yet I feel hugely challenging.

16
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.120
Can I ask you to put your books or your laptops on the neath your church please.

17
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.710
Your mobile phones,

18
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.490
your handbags or your mind bikes,

19
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.770
and you're going to do the following for me.

20
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.820
Can I ask you in the next 60 seconds to meet all the Googlers,

21
00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.790
shake their hand and tell them what's your Niamh on?

22
00:01:29.791 --> 00:01:33.810
What do you currently do for Google that is including everybody,

23
00:01:33.811 --> 00:01:38.100
even the guys and girls and Aav on even the guys and girls in McNulty

24
00:01:38.101 --> 00:01:40.800
performance.
You've got 60 seconds to do it,

25
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.270
which means you must do but high energy and a lot of fun.
Let's roll

26
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.980
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

27
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.590
<v 0>love the energy up Saturday.
Love that energy.</v>

28
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.750
The person's sitting on you.

29
00:02:09.751 --> 00:02:12.300
Give them a little bit of a nudge with your elbow for me.

30
00:02:12.301 --> 00:02:13.860
Please give them in a bit of a nudge.

31
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.060
Can we have about 40 minutes with no ego?
Was that okay?

32
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.520
I don't really care if you've got a degree.

33
00:02:20.521 --> 00:02:22.950
I don't care if you've got a phd at own cure.

34
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.070
If you've got a masters or two masters.
I don't really care.

35
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.430
I know nothing about Google.
It's I'm not going to came.

36
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.710
That'll anything with Google,
like a Kim to say or no,
a or B or c.

37
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.050
I know zero about Google.
Is that okay?

38
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.930
So I'm not going to tell you how to do your jobs.

39
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.980
I'm not going to tell you how to do anything better because I don't know

40
00:02:37.981 --> 00:02:41.490
anything.
So I don't have the Arctic as Italia Hodes do anything better.

41
00:02:41.491 --> 00:02:45.360
Is that fair enough?
And just for a bit of fun,
it's a pretty big rugby weekend,

42
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.840
just for a bit of form.
You're going to less than a few little exercises at that.

43
00:02:48.841 --> 00:02:50.970
So Kevin,
everybody,
if I said Taco,

44
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.930
I need y'all up on your feet and it wrote B and a rugby tackle position.

45
00:02:54.931 --> 00:02:57.540
Is that okay?
That's going to look a little bit like this.

46
00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.990
You're going to stand up quickly with your up in the already

47
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.630
<v 2>to tackle.
Is that for,
let's try that out.
I want a side effect to that.</v>

48
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.200
I'm going to call you South Africa.
I'm going to call you Ireland.
Is that okay?

49
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.300
Let's start off with South Africa.
Taco average.

50
00:03:13.301 --> 00:03:16.740
Take a seat.
Okay.
I'm going to call you.
You guys aren't in the water.

51
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.110
We had good passion.
I want really good at Gresham and what we had.

52
00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:22.740
Good sound effects.
Okay,
Taco,

53
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.830

Kim.
Okay.
Ready to go.
So give me a bit more sign please.

54
00:03:28.831 --> 00:03:32.140
And this megaphone to the factor of gentlemen,

please.
Device shared on need.

56
00:03:34.511 --> 00:03:39.250
You would you bringing your best energy?
Tyco,
you're in a week.

57
00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:41.650
Okay.
All right.
And do not give in to these guys.

58
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.710
Please do not given Taco no brainer if I see ruin.

59
00:03:47.011 --> 00:03:47.471
And by the way,

60
00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:50.170
that's gonna include all the girls in case on the right hand side as well.

61
00:03:50.171 --> 00:03:55.060
And they said,
Ron,
I need you to run faster than your competitor on your left,

62
00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.420
your right hand side with your feet on the floor.
Next soap.
Okay,
cool.

63
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.260
<v 1>Foster opus.
Stop.</v>

64
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:06.010
<v 2>If I say engage,</v>

65
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.550
I need you to put your arms Vernie quickly around the gay or the girl on your

66
00:04:09.551 --> 00:04:11.920
left or your right hand side and rich

67
00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:15.373
<v 1>Taco.</v>

68
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.030
<v 2>Pretty great at any stage during this session.
If I use any of those,
that'll cous</v>

69
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.980
<v 0>get a move pretty quickly.
Is that okay?
On a serious note.</v>

70
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.690
How many of you think that seminars are the way we educate people is actually

71
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.110
dead that we know need to stimulate in a different way?

72
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.900
We need to engage in a different way and we need to make it fun.

73
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.610
We need to make it entertaining and we need to make it incredibly stimulating.

74
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.080
If you strongly agree with that,
please scream yes in your native language.

75
00:04:49.081 --> 00:04:51.060
That is of your Irish said an Irish.

76
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.140
If you're a French said in French of your Spanish set,
in Spanish and so on.

77
00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.610
If you strongly agree with that comment,
please scream yes and your language go.

78
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.270
I love to hear of Tosh added very loud.

79
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.690
For those who are not Irish tie is yes in Irish.

80
00:05:06.691 --> 00:05:10.200
I know you're all incredibly fluent ours speakers.
I know.

81
00:05:10.201 --> 00:05:13.260
They're actually say some people in the audience.
Your third RSP Taco.

82
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.730
<v 2>Okay.
This session is not focused on Google,
I hope.</v>

83
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.200
<v 0>Did you take it as a little gift to you?</v>

84
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.220
Maybe it's a good time of the year to start to reflect on your potential and the

85
00:05:26.221 --> 00:05:30.390
session is 100% oriented towards your potential.

86
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.140
We're going to cover about three or four key things.
One,
your mindset,

87
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.780
I 100% believe.
If you have the right mindset,
then you can unlock your potential,

88
00:05:39.781 --> 00:05:43.950
whether it's in your sporting life,
your business life,
your personal life too.

89
00:05:43.951 --> 00:05:45.090
We're going to talk about your energy.

90
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.870
We believe firmly that whether you're in these sort of scenarios or whether

91
00:05:48.871 --> 00:05:53.280
you're in Google,
you're energy is absolutely everything.
And lastly,

92
00:05:53.281 --> 00:05:55.680
we're going to talk a little bit about your mission and your goals.

93
00:05:55.681 --> 00:06:00.681
We refer to mission like goals on steroids as if you're injecting steroids into

94
00:06:00.831 --> 00:06:04.970
your arms and you're going to chess hard off of your goals as a mom,
as a dad,

95
00:06:04.971 --> 00:06:08.720
as a husband,
as a wife,
or maybe as an employee.
Tackle

96
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.290
the session.
I guess you're,
you are in the right paths.

97
00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:20.010
That's okay.
You are in the right place.
I hope it's okay with you guys.

98
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.570
I would say a lot of you and your Google life,

99
00:06:23.571 --> 00:06:25.690
maybe in your business life or maybe even your family,

100
00:06:25.691 --> 00:06:29.960
feel a little bit like this.
You're going,
whoa.
I may go on to possibly parlance.

101
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.360
I've just bought a house or an apartment in Dublin.

102
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:37.670
I've just got a team of 25 people and managing 200 people in total across

103
00:06:37.671 --> 00:06:39.860
Europe.
I'm under major pressure.

104
00:06:39.861 --> 00:06:44.010
I'm expected to hit these sales numbers continually and the more seals I had

105
00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.840
more what happens ladies and gentlemen and a CEO's role.

106
00:06:47.841 --> 00:06:51.740
The more see we had what happens higher targets and then what happens higher

107
00:06:51.741 --> 00:06:55.040
targets on the higher the targets and where we feel like,
Holy Shit,

108
00:06:55.041 --> 00:06:58.520
how am I going to stay on this?
And then you're thinking,
what about my family?

109
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.820
I'm one of them are friends that I haven't had a glass of wine with for the last

110
00:07:01.821 --> 00:07:04.520
six months and one of them I really,

111
00:07:04.521 --> 00:07:07.430
really best friend that I haven't even met for the last 12 months.

112
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.660
So very often the busier we get,
the more successful they get.

113
00:07:11.661 --> 00:07:12.860
The more we kind that ladder,

114
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.700
the more it starts to feel more like a tight rope rather than a ladder.

115
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:21.080
If you can relate to that please.
Can I ask you to scream?
Yes and your language?

116
00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:24.190
No,
we've got a bit of a lower tone now.

117
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.830
You realize that session would be a lot of fun,
but also a bit of a serious side.

118
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.030
If I say a change seats,
by the way,
I'm very weary of the people in May.

119
00:07:31.031 --> 00:07:33.890
Right hand side.
I want you to change seats very quickly.

120
00:07:33.891 --> 00:07:38.690
The person who's a slowest to change seats would have a per shops penalty.

121
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:41.180
Okay.

122
00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:45.650
Please be CFNI conscious per shelf penalty means you're going to be up here

123
00:07:45.651 --> 00:07:49.190
doing at least 10 per shops change.

124
00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.133
<v 1>Okay,</v>

125
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:04.490
<v 0>so one of the things in talking to Carlene advanced this session,
Carney,</v>

126
00:08:04.491 --> 00:08:07.820
thank you very much for the work you're doing and Tony Mccartney and she talked

127
00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:12.200
about one of the big things should like those to refer to is confidence.

128
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:14.570
I last,
I laughed,

129
00:08:14.571 --> 00:08:19.571
Irish rugby camp last night at 1230 and Kardon house after spending a bit four

130
00:08:20.871 --> 00:08:24.200
and a half hours and back to back one on ones with some of the Irish

131
00:08:24.201 --> 00:08:27.770
international gay players.
Then we had a manager meeting talking about the game,

132
00:08:27.771 --> 00:08:28.670
obviously the weekend.

133
00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:33.020
Would you believe a lot of the international stars would come to me in a regular

134
00:08:33.021 --> 00:08:35.630
basis and say,
Andy,
I'm not confident.

135
00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.470
Please can you help me in my confidence.
But yet in the corporate world,

136
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:44.500
we verde very Seldomly get men to come to us to say the need to work on their

137
00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:45.470
confidence.

138
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:49.160
Women will come to us a lot more regularly and knock on the door and say,
listen,

139
00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.820
I don't have enough confidence as a manager.

140
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.640
I actually am not confident enough night and make current role.

141
00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:00.660
I don't know if I'm confident I can continue to grow in this organization and so

142
00:09:00.661 --> 00:09:02.010
on.
So in this session,

143
00:09:02.011 --> 00:09:06.330
hopefully we'll give you a snapshot into how you can improve your confidence.

144
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.180
But what I get to think of Beta,

145
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:12.510
imagine that everybody in this room for the next 12 months fully committed to

146
00:09:12.511 --> 00:09:15.660
your potential.
What were the impact personally?

147
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.320
What would be the impact in terms of your professional life?

148
00:09:19.321 --> 00:09:20.940
What would the impact in terms of your friends,

149
00:09:20.941 --> 00:09:23.940
what would be the impact in terms of getting the most out of your life,

150
00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:25.530
even getting the most out of your weekends?

151
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:29.130
What do you agree with me that if you did that you'd have dramatic impact on all

152
00:09:29.131 --> 00:09:30.870
aspects of your life?
We just totally agree with that.

153
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:34.990
Just raise your hands and clap your hands vigorously if you agree with that.
Go

154
00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:41.340
<v 1>faster,
faster,
faster,
faster,
faster,
faster,
faster,</v>

155
00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:42.403
faster.

156
00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.740
<v 0>So that's what we're abide.
What a bike hep on your own,
lock your potential.</v>

157
00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:49.440
And again,
I don't know about you ladies and gentlemen,

158
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:54.090
what I would guess that if you're here by this time next year,

159
00:09:54.091 --> 00:09:55.140
you're going to have to go to here.

160
00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:59.250
If you're a bit more than experience and you'll feel like you're here by this

161
00:09:59.250 --> 00:09:59.251
time next year,

162
00:09:59.251 --> 00:10:02.280
you're going to have to go to there and maybe if you're here and you think

163
00:10:02.281 --> 00:10:04.830
you've arrived or you're starting to derive a bad year,

164
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:07.530
you're probably have to go back to that.

165
00:10:07.531 --> 00:10:09.630
Whether it's you're just to have your fourth child,

166
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:13.530
whether it's you're just about to change role,
whether it's you're going to say,

167
00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:17.160
I really didn't look after my body.
I really need looking after my body.

168
00:10:17.161 --> 00:10:19.830
Now I'm up here in terms of where I am and my professional life.

169
00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:23.250
But I'm dying here in terms of my physical fitness and wellbeing.

170
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:24.540
If you're going really after that,

171
00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:27.540
can I ask you to jump up and cop at the seam time?
Go.

172
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.560
<v 1>That's a take a sick quickly</v>

173
00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.040
<v 0>terms of mindset.</v>

174
00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:40.820
We're going to give you a quick masterclass and mindset and rather than me

175
00:10:40.821 --> 00:10:43.040
talking igm page Nadya let's do the opposite.

176
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:46.610
I'm going to ask you in groups of twos with the gay or the girls sitting

177
00:10:46.611 --> 00:10:51.080
alongside.
Yeah,
just discuss three things for me please.
Number one,

178
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:54.830
how would you rate your main set of 10 10 out of 10 is the best and possibly

179
00:10:54.831 --> 00:10:55.664
could be.

180
00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:59.780
Nine out of 10 is your main set actually is holding you back significantly.

181
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:04.760
We actually call that main set sabotage.
Okay.
Number two,

182
00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:08.630
please target with somebody who inspires you in life in terms of mindset,

183
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:12.170
whether that's an amazing female actress,
whether that's your mother,

184
00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.720
whether that is perhaps your girlfriend or whatever.

185
00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:18.110
Please talk with someone who inspires you have and main set.
Number two,

186
00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:22.790
and the last thing I want you to speak about very quickly is what's the single

187
00:11:22.791 --> 00:11:25.460
biggest thing holding your main set back?

188
00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:29.650
You must discuss all that and I'm at 60 seconds,
so please go to work.
Cool.

189
00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:36.893
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

190
00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:41.680
<v 0>I really,
really love,
love your energy,
guys.</v>

191
00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:43.451
Love your energy.

192
00:11:43.451 --> 00:11:47.890
I love your enthusiasm where any of you ever had something in the last five or

193
00:11:47.891 --> 00:11:52.150
10 or 15 years and you've gotta remember almost every word that was Santa for

194
00:11:52.151 --> 00:11:55.540
some reason.
That impact or that session of that experience,

195
00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:58.310
how to very inspirational impact in your life,
hands up.

196
00:11:58.311 --> 00:12:02.740
If you can relate to that over the last five or 10 or 15 years,
please.
Well,

197
00:12:02.741 --> 00:12:06.040
let's imagine that if this session was they've got for you and your personal

198
00:12:06.041 --> 00:12:08.410
life or your professional life in the next five or 10 or 15 years,

199
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:12.610
that'll mean everybody will need to be incredibly tuned and incredibly,

200
00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:15.670
let's say engage from an energy point of view.
Is that all kid ask?

201
00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:17.770
So we're going to run pretty fast,

202
00:12:17.771 --> 00:12:21.070
but then we've got a sword right down and hopefully make an impact on you in

203
00:12:21.071 --> 00:12:22.810
terms of your potential.

204
00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.320
I wonder if you were to think about main set,

205
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:31.430
what do you think about something challenging in your personal life?

206
00:12:31.431 --> 00:12:34.280
Would you say it's something challenging at work or where would you start?

207
00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:35.990
I'm going to start with telling you a story.

208
00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:38.040
<v 1>Okay.</v>

209
00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.380
<v 0>I'm from Northern Ireland,
just across the border.</v>

210
00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:45.810
I'm about probably five males across the border into northern art and brought up

211
00:12:45.811 --> 00:12:49.440
there obviously and my whole life and then eventually moved on the Dobbin here.

212
00:12:49.441 --> 00:12:51.930
But 10 years ago,
um,
when I was a child,

213
00:12:51.931 --> 00:12:56.930
for some reason I was stunned brushing my teeth at the,
uh,

214
00:12:57.150 --> 00:13:01.020
bathroom window,
looking into them or abortion,
my teeth nice and calm.
Nice.

215
00:13:01.021 --> 00:13:02.130
And what acts as a little boy.

216
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:05.850
And for some reason I get the sense Emma stomach shit.

217
00:13:05.851 --> 00:13:08.970
There's something not right here.
Can I don't know why,

218
00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:13.590
but almost this second sense or this sixth sense,
something's not right.

219
00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.020
And others,
Bushman teeth,
next thing.

220
00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:16.923
<v 1>Okay.</v>

221
00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:22.730
<v 0>The window that I was brushing my teeth into and the murderer smashed all over</v>

222
00:13:22.731 --> 00:13:27.230
my face.
And again,
remember having glass and when my and going,

223
00:13:27.231 --> 00:13:30.320
what the has after happening,
it was a bomb attack.

224
00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:35.660
The Irish Republican Army had planted a bomb beside my host at home and blue

225
00:13:35.661 --> 00:13:39.070
that the windows into smithereens and the glass literally was in my mouth and it

226
00:13:39.071 --> 00:13:41.210
was taking it to toothbrush.
Shadow.

227
00:13:41.211 --> 00:13:44.200
Am I spitting into the sink with bloating?

228
00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:47.960
The single what has after happening cause it's actually the image of what

229
00:13:47.961 --> 00:13:52.670
happened that particular day they ash Republican Army had killed better
soldiers.

230
00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:54.530
We won't get into politics,
don't worry.

231
00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:58.370
But that particular day or that killed Peter soldiers just very close to my

232
00:13:58.371 --> 00:14:01.850
house at home and a really,
really bad bomb attack.

233
00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:04.010
But that's not the important part.

234
00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.160
The important part is I walked into the charter of the home,

235
00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:10.430
but we have a big long card or a bit like the card or through the middle of

236
00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:15.460
where you guys are setting and I walked in and next thing I can hear my little

237
00:14:15.681 --> 00:14:18.740
sister eem or screaming Sarah.

238
00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.760
My older sister had already left for school and having outside the House

239
00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:26.600
screaming,
Sarah Screaming.
She was inconsolable.

240
00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:31.160
Screaming and shouting and ranting and raving and next thing Sarah ran back

241
00:14:31.161 --> 00:14:34.310
towards the house.
Thankfully Sarah was okay,
ran back towards the highs,

242
00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:39.470
but all I remember was her lower legs,
blood running down her lower legs.

243
00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:40.580
For whatever reason,

244
00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:44.420
the shop node from the bomb had hit are lower legs and she had a little bit of

245
00:14:44.421 --> 00:14:48.110
blood on her lower legs.
I remember my mother,

246
00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:53.510
my mother was in the house and she remained ice cone,

247
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:58.220
completely calm,
completely resilient,

248
00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:01.950
completely compassionate,
completely Corinne.

249
00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:05.480
Everybody in the house and the host was going crazy.
Frantic.
What's going on?

250
00:15:05.481 --> 00:15:08.090
What's happening?
The windows were shattered in around the house.

251
00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:12.070
Everybody in the house.
My father,
my sisters,
my brothers all go on frantic,

252
00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:15.950
screaming,
roaring.
She literally never linked.

253
00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:21.200
All right.
Ice,
Kuhn,
resilient,
Caring and compassionate.

254
00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.360
She says,
get a seat in the living room.
The living room.

255
00:15:23.361 --> 00:15:27.170
Is it a small room in the middle of the host?
The window wasn't broken.
Get it.

256
00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:30.080
Sit down there on the couch.
She went off on me a tea.

257
00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:32.450
She bought the tee in as if it was any other Sunday.

258
00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:35.000
She bought the D in is any Irish mommy will do,

259
00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:39.200
but the tea and sat us all around tonight.
Calm down.
It's okay.
Calm down.

260
00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:42.500
Put the TV on the background and Sega was there and he's starting to come

261
00:15:42.501 --> 00:15:43.820
through and and use flash or whatever it was.

262
00:15:43.821 --> 00:15:47.690
I was aware before CNN and sky sports sat us all down.

263
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:51.210
15 minutes later she says to me,
and I'll never forget it,

264
00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:56.210
and have you got football training today?
Yeah,
Mama.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Going,

265
00:15:56.211 --> 00:15:59.990
get your bike.
What do you mean going to bag?
I'm not going to,

266
00:15:59.991 --> 00:16:03.170
you're going to school.
Get your bag.
So she says,

267
00:16:03.171 --> 00:16:05.270
and they're going get your football by going to the screw bag.

268
00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.640
Your father is going to take her to school.
So my father,

269
00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:11.040
Joe was the schools and that day at about three 30 words,

270
00:16:11.041 --> 00:16:15.350
seeing them for football like any other day,
my mother and not little instance,

271
00:16:15.351 --> 00:16:17.510
if there's only probably three to four minutes,

272
00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:22.640
give us a life long lesson and how resilient we can train ourselves to become an

273
00:16:22.641 --> 00:16:27.641
adversity and how the impact of your mindset can impact everything in your life.

274
00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:33.410
Even in a very difficult,
challenging adverse environment.

275
00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:38.680
The vast majority of people aren't even top it into a 10th of a resilience and a

276
00:16:39.741 --> 00:16:44.540
10th of a kid belly from a mindset point of view.
So that little story,

277
00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:47.480
even though it was a very short little occurrence,

278
00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.320
inspired me for the rest of my life.
My mother is still very healthy.

279
00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:55.340
She's still an incredible woman and she still inspires me in the local community

280
00:16:55.341 --> 00:16:58.280
in terms of their potential.
She was a teacher.

281
00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:02.540
She spent 35 years or relay for teaching young kids,

282
00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.080
whether it was an English language,
English literature.
But most importantly,

283
00:17:06.081 --> 00:17:09.470
I think she was a teacher of how you unlock your potential.

284
00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:12.350
So I'm going to devote and dedicate this session to my mother.

285
00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:14.720
Please stay attuned.
Tackle

286
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.240
Ireland are more sharper than South Africa,
very clearly and gage.

287
00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:30.990
Okay,
so you might slip it under that.
So really grinding story.

288
00:17:30.991 --> 00:17:34.140
I wanted the grind yet in that.
Let's make it a bit more positive.

289
00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:38.220
This is a picture of my friend Desi ran who features very firmly in the book

290
00:17:38.221 --> 00:17:42.870
commit.
He spent 25 years and New York City as a fireman.

291
00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:46.320
I know a lot of you are in leadership and management roles and I've been

292
00:17:46.321 --> 00:17:50.220
inspired by a lot of leaders or managers in business,
but to be honest with you,

293
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.240
ladies and gentlemen,

294
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:56.160
I have never met anybody who's even close to this gentleman in terms of leading

295
00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:58.770
and inspiring,
never even close.

296
00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:01.740
He learned his trade in the Bronx in New York City.

297
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:07.400
If you're in the Bronx on your head and dine time and an unbelievable cohesive

298
00:18:07.711 --> 00:18:12.690
unit and a fire engine and you hadn't died time expecting to come across really

299
00:18:12.691 --> 00:18:14.130
big challenges,

300
00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:19.080
you're going to learn leadership on pretty quickly and my Gaelic football career

301
00:18:19.081 --> 00:18:21.530
and lucky to have had been coached by on Bay,

302
00:18:21.531 --> 00:18:24.210
but five years he treated everybody equally.

303
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.330
He challenged us every day to be at our best,

304
00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:30.930
each challenges every day to bring our bass energy and bring our egg IOM.

305
00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:33.870
He challenged us to be better leaders and better footballers.

306
00:18:33.871 --> 00:18:37.530
You Pat our man as well as better technically and tactically.

307
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.350
How many of you think that if you had somebody that in your life,

308
00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:43.470
it was significantly allow you to unlock your potential?

309
00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.810
Pretty important.
If you're in a leadership role,
that's your role.

310
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:52.770
Your role is to help other people.
I'm knocked their potential.

311
00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:55.280
Your role is to help inspire other people.

312
00:18:55.281 --> 00:18:58.140
I don't mean at an offsite once a year and an old Google two off sites better

313
00:18:58.141 --> 00:19:02.550
than anybody,
and I don't mean at a Google talk.
I mean on an ongoing basis.

314
00:19:02.551 --> 00:19:07.110
Your role is to inspire people to as he is now,
he's 76 years of age.

315
00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:12.270
He still winning medals.
Belief from kindy.
Kearney is 84 years of age.

316
00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:17.070
He still winning medals.
These guys mindset is incredible.

317
00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:21.960
Always growing,
always learning all with stretching.

318
00:19:21.961 --> 00:19:25.500
The binary's all was thinking,
can they get fitter?
Can they improve?

319
00:19:25.501 --> 00:19:27.780
Can they improve their brand?
Can they improve their body?

320
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:31.380
What about you guys in the audience?
Do you think you can improve?

321
00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:35.670
Because I would bet you everybody in this audience and the next 12 months,

322
00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:40.590
whether you're a 30 whether you're 25 whether you're 40 whether you're 45 we're

323
00:19:40.591 --> 00:19:44.250
going to have a lot of mountains ahead.
Whether it's mountains in our jobs,

324
00:19:44.251 --> 00:19:46.050
whether it's mountains and our personal lives,

325
00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.600
whether it's mountains in terms of financial scenarios,

326
00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:50.160
whether it's mountains physically,

327
00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:54.960
we're going to be encountering those in the next 1224 months and beyond.

328
00:19:54.961 --> 00:19:58.710
The research says we're going to meet adversely about every seven weeks.

329
00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:01.980
We normally say you're going to be diversity,
but every seven days,

330
00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:04.980
that's give you the skills to know how to deal with that adversity.

331
00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:10.020
So if you think about what is the definition of mindset in 30 seconds with the

332
00:20:10.021 --> 00:20:14.550
guy or the girl and your left ear,
right?
Define what mindset means.
Go.

333
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:26.850
So no,
that hasn't come up for whatever reason,

334
00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:30.150
the screen and what you all do the same time as me to scream nest site and

335
00:20:30.151 --> 00:20:34.590
unison.
Is that okay?
Mindset is,
let me start.
Here we go.

336
00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:44.220
That's a pretty profound definition of mindset,
isn't it?

337
00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:49.330
Think about the significance of that in your life over 2030 40 50 60 years.

338
00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:53.440
If you get your mindset right,
imagine therefore you get your beliefs right.

339
00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:56.740
Therefore you get your thinking right.
Therefore you get your behavior right,

340
00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:00.580
your art look great on your med latitude rate,
but let's flip that on its head.

341
00:21:00.581 --> 00:21:03.600
What have you got it wrong?
I don't want to talk about it.

342
00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:05.110
Let's keep this session really,
really positive.

343
00:21:05.111 --> 00:21:07.330
Let's keep it on getting it [inaudible] very much,
right?

344
00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:12.310
And please imagine this says that classroom that my mother taught in a Northern

345
00:21:12.311 --> 00:21:17.260
Ireland.
If you get your mindset right,
we get our get her attitude right.

346
00:21:17.261 --> 00:21:20.660
We get her.
Get your behavior right please.
All in unison.
We,

347
00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:22.240
we've got her actions,
right,

348
00:21:22.241 --> 00:21:26.290
but get her so most companies focus on results.

349
00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:30.310
Most of the time care,
Pas,
results see results.
I'm bored.

350
00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:35.230
What am I talking about?
Main set?
What a bit.
I'm conference.

351
00:21:35.231 --> 00:21:38.050
Somebody whose main set what a bit on luck in their mindset and therefore

352
00:21:38.051 --> 00:21:40.990
imagine the results the team can achieve on those.

353
00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.870
We move towards higher and better.
I'm more consistent.

354
00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:47.200
I'm more enduring performance,
but what about you?

355
00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:50.950
Have you got a growth mindset or you got a fixed mindset?
Growth Mindset?

356
00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:54.970
They're always curious to go meet different people at Google every day to learn

357
00:21:54.971 --> 00:21:55.600
from them.

358
00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:58.380
They actually go out of the way to meeting people that are completely different

359
00:21:58.381 --> 00:21:58.990
on them,

360
00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:02.920
not the same person with the Sim background and the cm language and the cm

361
00:22:02.921 --> 00:22:07.120
preferences on fixed mindset.
I don't like feedback.

362
00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:11.910
Fixed mindset.
I don't get coaching fixed mindset.

363
00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:15.190
I don't get mentoring fixed mindset.
I don't go on those programs.

364
00:22:15.191 --> 00:22:17.200
The HR team are running fixed mindset.

365
00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:19.820
I don't use the gym here and I don't really like it.
Yeah,

366
00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:21.390
it's the best gym and done,
but I don't really like it.

367
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.170
I don't use the swimming pool.
It's actually a smell of Corrine.
[inaudible].

368
00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:28.660
Okay.
I don't want to,
don't go to the person and change here then.

369
00:22:28.661 --> 00:22:31.540
I'm pretty good.
I know them.
They're exceptional.
No,

370
00:22:31.541 --> 00:22:35.740
I don't need to get fed and fed enough fixed mindset.

371
00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:40.330
I want you to just for a minute,
I'm going to put on music.
I'm not going to talk.

372
00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:44.380
I want you to read through these and I want you to Terranea to which one of

373
00:22:44.381 --> 00:22:48.220
those is connected to you and where are you currently are in terms of your

374
00:22:48.221 --> 00:22:49.054
mindset,

375
00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.860
growth mindset.
When getting feedback,
a recognize me weaknesses.

376
00:23:10.861 --> 00:23:15.420
They know what the fix fixed mindset.
This worker's boring.
No one likes to do it.

377
00:23:15.421 --> 00:23:16.590
Why are you giving me feedback?

378
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.740
Growth Mindset town did peers,
I wonder,
uh,

379
00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.950
I wonder how the data,
let me figure it out.
Can I go and meet them?

380
00:23:25.951 --> 00:23:28.590
A nerve from them.
I have a bottle of beer with them.
Growth Mindset,

381
00:23:28.591 --> 00:23:32.830
fixed mindset that batch ho how's she doing that?
Okay.

382
00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:35.070
Growth mindset desires.

383
00:23:35.071 --> 00:23:38.430
I want to learn new things in Google and I'd say to Google and my sport and my

384
00:23:38.431 --> 00:23:42.750
personal life and my professional life on here affects mindset.

385
00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:45.060
I stick to what I know.
I'm good at sales,

386
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.880
good at management and not a good communicator.

387
00:23:46.881 --> 00:23:50.180
My emotional intelligence and good and never whether good fixed mindset.

388
00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:54.500
I bet you everybody in the audience can relate to either here or here and the

389
00:23:54.501 --> 00:23:56.090
good news is everyone in the audience.
Actually.

390
00:23:56.091 --> 00:23:58.130
Sometimes it's fixed on sometimes where growth.

391
00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:00.200
The key is when we find ourselves here,

392
00:24:00.201 --> 00:24:03.770
it's a drag ourselves very quickly towards a growth mindset.

393
00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:09.350
This is the most par full piece of technology anybody has currently got in this

394
00:24:09.351 --> 00:24:12.920
audience.
That makes sense.
I know you're a Google.
Phones are cool as hell.

395
00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:17.840
I know your technologies could as hell,
but this is far more powerful.

396
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:20.410
[inaudible] past Master Rana Plaza.
Such ma'am,

397
00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:21.423
<v 1>please.</v>

398
00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:27.390
<v 0>One of the things we're doing in the art,
and we'll be set up at the moment that,</v>

399
00:24:27.391 --> 00:24:31.530
but a lot of business teams around the word on people who are elite performers,

400
00:24:31.531 --> 00:24:33.900
one of those as a young lady from spin,

401
00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:38.670
who's an elite surgeon on baby's eyes,
that's a pretty significant role,
isn't it?

402
00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:42.990
I just spent a huge amount of time at the moment develop and her Brian Parr

403
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:45.090
develop on her mindset development,

404
00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:48.900
her brain's muscle so she can perform much better operations,

405
00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:51.360
much more consistently and much more accurately.

406
00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:54.680
So I wonder how many of you in the last 12 months would say you've spent any

407
00:24:54.681 --> 00:24:58.440
time training your brain?
That's a pretty important most of doesn't it?

408
00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:01.710
So everybody goes,
I'm going to yoga,
I'm going to zoom bar,

409
00:25:01.711 --> 00:25:04.680
I'm going to [inaudible] spinning,
or I'm going to,

410
00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:09.870
what else you use case doing triathlon.
I'm doing that five care at the weekend.

411
00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:12.150
But how many of you are actually training your brain?
In other words,

412
00:25:12.151 --> 00:25:16.140
training your brands a better lead to deal with adversity and to allow you to

413
00:25:16.141 --> 00:25:18.150
unlock your potential hands up nice and a hey,

414
00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:23.390
who's doing any brand training whatsoever up solutely amazing master Ren.

415
00:25:23.441 --> 00:25:24.780
Applause for those guys and girls,

416
00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:28.230
<v 1>your guys and girls.</v>

417
00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:31.110
<v 0>No more than five seconds to get the front of the room.</v>

418
00:25:31.111 --> 00:25:33.600
You're going to tell everybody what you're doing quickly run to the front of the

419
00:25:33.601 --> 00:25:34.434
room.
Yes ma'am.

420
00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:48.720
So these guys and girls of all got growth mind set,
get a mint and credit,
right?

421
00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:51.153
<v 1>Pause.</v>

422
00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:57.060
<v 0>You guys are going to get these guys to do it but take an activity but you're</v>

423
00:25:57.061 --> 00:25:59.430
going to be South Africa and you are going to be the Dublin team.

424
00:25:59.431 --> 00:26:01.950
Is that fair enough?
So can I have a little bit of space in the middle?

425
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:05.550
You're South Africa and you guys are going to get them doing almost like that

426
00:26:05.551 --> 00:26:07.440
Icelandic clap like that.

427
00:26:07.441 --> 00:26:09.280
You're going to do it in unison and you you're going to do it and you just send

428
00:26:09.281 --> 00:26:12.800
off to them and you guys are going to be boxing and you guys are going to be

429
00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:16.620
boxing and unison after them.
Does that make sense?
Okay,
ready?

430
00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:18.750
You're in copying where you go.

431
00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:22.540
<v 1>You're a boxing.
Where do you go</v>

432
00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:30.600
faster on the voice on the wife as well.

433
00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:36.580
<v 0>Stip and Ryan.</v>

434
00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:39.020
You guys are going to box and you guys are going to do Icelandic cup.
Stop.

435
00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:40.770
<v 1>Go Fuck.</v>

436
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:46.343
Stop.

437
00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:49.540
<v 2>You guys are going to do I sound a cup.
When you guys want the boxing quickly go</v>

438
00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:57.913
<v 1>stop</v>

439
00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:01.320
<v 2>everybody in the room.
Icelandic club one gay.
There is a bit too cleaver.</v>

440
00:27:01.321 --> 00:27:04.650
A screen can help you to set up.
What's your first name?
Yeah.
Yeah.

441
00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:06.920
I'll be a calm gridlock.
Mom,
you're to,
Craig was going.

442
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:12.080
You're actually going to lead the whole group.
Is that okay?

443
00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:15.200
We're going to need the whole dream.
Okay.

444
00:27:15.201 --> 00:27:18.320
You're going to do the Icelandic Cup from here.
Everybody in the whole room.

445
00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:20.360
<v 0>How did it go?</v>

446
00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:34.550
<v 1>That's
fine.</v>

447
00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:37.910
<v 2>Take a big quick play.
You've got three seconds to get a seat.</v>

448
00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:39.680
Otherwise you're going to be on par shops.

449
00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:48.080
<v 0>So in terms of your mindset,
guys,
I'm going to give you a,</v>

450
00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:52.720
what we called sesame street.
Simple feedback on main set.

451
00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:56.910
Number one,
be open to learn in the moment.
We always use the phrase,

452
00:27:56.911 --> 00:27:59.760
if there's somebody crazy and your work peers,
go and meet them.

453
00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:01.640
Go and spend time with them.

454
00:28:01.641 --> 00:28:04.800
Meet them for a bottle of beer and there's so many crazy in your community and

455
00:28:04.801 --> 00:28:09.180
be crazy.
I mean,
good,
crazy.
They're thinking and your local community,

456
00:28:09.181 --> 00:28:14.181
if I create an a global business in the same way as the founders of Google were

457
00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:17.880
crazy,
if they weren't crazy,
Google would not exist.

458
00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:23.000
All the major corporations in the world exists because somebody inevitably hard

459
00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:26.910
I growth mindset number one,
be open to learn in the moment.
Number two,

460
00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:31.320
we use the word haunt for feedback.
Does that make sense?

461
00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:33.990
The best people in old performance.

462
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:38.070
Crucibles are seeking feedback constantly after every performance,

463
00:28:38.071 --> 00:28:40.380
after every meeting,
after every sales call,

464
00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:42.870
after every one on one with their manager,

465
00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.180
maybe after cooking dinner for their children.

466
00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:48.840
Constantly seeking feedback and I'm using that one as a funny one,

467
00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:51.150
but maybe that's a more important way.
I'll find that out.

468
00:28:51.151 --> 00:28:53.310
How you're doing at home,
nevermind how you're doing at work.

469
00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:57.510
How many of you can relate to that one?
Please?
Sick and hunt for feedback,

470
00:28:57.511 --> 00:28:59.400
coaching and mentoring.
Hands up.

471
00:28:59.401 --> 00:29:04.080
How many in the audience have a coach that's not even a third of the audience.

472
00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:07.670
The rest of your bestie telling me you don't really value your improvement and

473
00:29:07.671 --> 00:29:10.170
your development.
How many of the Irish she'll get players.

474
00:29:10.171 --> 00:29:14.010
Would it be acceptable to say that don't have a coach are Novak,
Jack,

475
00:29:14.011 --> 00:29:19.011
of which not the habit coach are [inaudible] not to have a coach or maybe even

476
00:29:19.111 --> 00:29:21.300
somebody like Oprah,
not to have a coach.

477
00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:25.620
What do you think or Madonna not to have a voice coach.
What do you think?

478
00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:31.060
It's pretty important,
isn't it?
Because you're,
you know,

479
00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:33.930
you have so many coaches.
At the university or is in corporate environment,

480
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:37.500
you have to seek out someone.
Then it's harder to seek out different north.

481
00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:40.840
You go outside professionally and you have to pay a lapse personal one.

482
00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:46.360
Ashlyn is probably one of the best Kamogi players in Ireland to give her a big

483
00:29:46.361 --> 00:29:47.194
round.
Oh fuck.

484
00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:49.403
<v 1>So</v>

485
00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:54.040
<v 0>actually he's right.
It is easier in sport,
but case that's exactly the point.</v>

486
00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:57.560
Differentiate your sets.
Go and get a coach.
I don't mean to get a coach in here,

487
00:29:57.770 --> 00:30:00.740
but get a coach out of here,
but find a coach who's going to help your weight.

488
00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:01.603
You don't have to pay.

489
00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:04.670
Find somebody in your team who could coach you and you could coach them.

490
00:30:04.671 --> 00:30:07.100
Develop your coaching skills,
upgrade your thinking,

491
00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:09.740
take risks and see failure as necessary.

492
00:30:09.741 --> 00:30:12.080
I guess that's one of the big things about your culture in general.

493
00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:14.960
Do something once a week that scares the life out of you.

494
00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.120
We've actually been testing you in this session.

495
00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:18.860
Are you willing to do little things?

496
00:30:18.861 --> 00:30:23.450
It's scurry and challenge and help you grow your conference zones and then

497
00:30:23.451 --> 00:30:26.720
obviously moved towards growth mindset,
continuous reading.

498
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:30.380
Even Warren Buffet talks about five hours a day and all you guys were doing

499
00:30:30.381 --> 00:30:31.430
favors a day of reading.

500
00:30:31.431 --> 00:30:36.200
I know you are absolutely development and obviously learning Taco.

501
00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:40.313
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

502
00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:44.360
<v 0>So what I want to challenge you on is I'm going to challenge you that in the</v>

503
00:30:44.361 --> 00:30:47.810
next seven days everybody put in the audience going to have an experiment,

504
00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:50.400
one ass better.
Your experiment has got to be a growth mindset.

505
00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:53.770
So of your friend says,
yeah,
that's called a salsa dancing and you don't go,
no,

506
00:30:53.771 --> 00:30:55.280
no,
no.
Having a team goal.

507
00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:58.940
One of your friends says that starred the gym next week and that's do a really

508
00:30:58.941 --> 00:31:03.680
good six weeks between now and Christmas.
Yeah,
I'm on board.
I will actually,

509
00:31:03.681 --> 00:31:04.790
I'm working,
I'm working to get the season.

510
00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:07.550
That's another one of your friends says,

511
00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:11.390
let's make sure we do the mark Pollock five care on in the dark.

512
00:31:11.391 --> 00:31:13.940
That's all I'm gonna buy two or three weeks time.
Let's do it for charity.

513
00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:17.120
Let's do what a friends and let's do it with some family members.
Right?

514
00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:20.720
So I'm on furred growth mindset.
I'm going to challenge in the next week as well.

515
00:31:20.721 --> 00:31:25.130
And every interaction you have with your manager or your boss or maybe with your

516
00:31:25.131 --> 00:31:28.280
team say,
can you give me feedback?
How did I do today?

517
00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:30.140
Really important question.

518
00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:33.740
I wouldn't talk about the people who are very fortunate to work with over the

519
00:31:33.741 --> 00:31:37.100
last 20 years,
but it would say there's one big thing to have in common.

520
00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:41.300
They're constantly looking for feedback.
The best of the best of them,

521
00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:42.680
whether it's to a surgeon,

522
00:31:42.681 --> 00:31:45.530
whether it's the elite superstars soccer player with this,

523
00:31:45.531 --> 00:31:47.150
the world class Golfer,

524
00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:52.450
or maybe it's a young superstar female teacher who's incredible and getting

525
00:31:52.611 --> 00:31:55.700
opportunities all over the world to go and teach other teachers.

526
00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:59.420
They're constantly seeking feedback,
so please can we ask you to start?

527
00:31:59.421 --> 00:32:03.290
I'm not journey in the next week.
Moving swiftly forward.

528
00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:07.880
If this lands on Green,
you guys want to jump tracks.
If it lands on red,

529
00:32:07.881 --> 00:32:10.220
you guys want to do boxing.
If Alonza and yellow,

530
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:15.230
you're going to be doing eh squat jumps and lands on blue,

531
00:32:15.981 --> 00:32:17.970
you're going to do what they called a stork stance.

532
00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:20.940
I wanted to ask you a balance.
Is that clear enough?
Yes,
Mr. Waters,

533
00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:23.900
just get to the music on,
ready to go.
So whenever the color is,

534
00:32:23.901 --> 00:32:25.520
I'm going to give you an exercise.
We already

535
00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:31.200
orange everybody on your feet running on the spot.
Go quick.

536
00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:35.683
<v 1>Faster</v>

537
00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:41.113
<v 0>foster.</v>

538
00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:43.123
<v 1>Okay,</v>

539
00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:47.380
<v 0>take a seat quickly.
Good.
That's when I hear,</v>

540
00:32:47.381 --> 00:32:51.580
I know what's going to be blue shadow boxing with a partner.

541
00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.560
Shadowboxing ghost.

542
00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:01.700
<v 1>Okay.</v>

543
00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:04.250
<v 0>We're very fortunate that in the last couple of months,</v>

544
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:07.490
one of the companies brought us to Costa Rica to work with our global leadership

545
00:33:07.491 --> 00:33:11.030
team for a full week.
They said the global,
each team was actually born,
died.

546
00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:13.480
And the one who spent a full week rejuvenate.
No,

547
00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:16.490
I bet you there's people in this audience who in the last year or two offenders

548
00:33:16.491 --> 00:33:20.840
have your born died.
I bet some of you,
an old people in your teams that are born,

549
00:33:20.841 --> 00:33:23.210
died.
I bet you somebody know people in your families who'd been born died.

550
00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:27.740
And in Costa Rica we got the most incredible inspiration about energy and

551
00:33:27.741 --> 00:33:31.280
wellness.
I'm going to try and get that across the year and about three minutes.

552
00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:35.630
It's sesame street simple.
And Costa Rica at the time.

553
00:33:35.631 --> 00:33:38.840
We're moving naturally.
Going to the gym once a day isn't good enough.

554
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:42.800
We need to build the movement into our days are everyday is we need to be up

555
00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:46.370
moving constantly if we want to live long,
healthy lives.

556
00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:48.650
That is scientifically proven case.

557
00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:52.280
Whether you absolutely believed that science or you don't,

558
00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:55.100
that's a different story that's related to your main set.

559
00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:57.530
We need to exercise every single day,

560
00:33:57.531 --> 00:33:59.390
whether it's in the gym or whether it's a run,

561
00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:03.230
but we also need to move every single day constantly.
Number one.

562
00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:06.830
Number two on your food at Google is incredible,

563
00:34:06.831 --> 00:34:11.540
but the only problem I've been incredibly as he,
a lot of it eat incredibly well,

564
00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:16.250
but eat less.
Don't fill your stomach's up constantly.
Number two,
number three,

565
00:34:16.251 --> 00:34:20.510
sleep is the number one silver bought it and your health and your wellness.

566
00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:21.373
Number one,

567
00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:24.650
how many of you need to improve the quality and the quantity of your sleep?

568
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.070
Hands up nice and high.
It's a corporate epidemic.

569
00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:31.730
People not sleeping well enough is a major,
major issue.

570
00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:35.330
By the way of your sleep is related to how much you move and of course high

571
00:34:35.331 --> 00:34:39.830
where you eat.
Stress is a secret killer.

572
00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:45.620
One of our colleagues is a cardiac surgeon who says the single biggest issue he

573
00:34:45.621 --> 00:34:49.400
has every single day and performing surgery isn't food.

574
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.550
It isn't a lack of exercise or smoking or alcohol.

575
00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:56.450
It's people in the corporate world who are not dealing with stress.

576
00:34:56.810 --> 00:35:00.380
If you can relate to that,
please can I ask you to have a big deep say for me

577
00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:05.900
it's a big issue and it's not Google's responsibility.

578
00:35:05.901 --> 00:35:07.760
It's your responsibility to manage stress.

579
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.670
So not a young guys and girls in the audience and the guys and girls.
The on,

580
00:35:10.671 --> 00:35:14.300
he's not so young.
A bit like me.
We need to manage our own stress,

581
00:35:14.301 --> 00:35:18.290
take a hundred percent responsibility and then alcohol and I know you guys don't

582
00:35:18.291 --> 00:35:20.200
drink a Google.
I don't need to talk about that one obviously,

583
00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:24.350
so I'm going to try and actually give you a quick master class end to that.

584
00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:25.183
Is that fair enough?

585
00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:28.370
I had you doing the boxing earlier on in your wall is sort of going through the

586
00:35:28.371 --> 00:35:29.710
motions.
What's all this about?

587
00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:34.040
I'm going to show you what happens if you actually get yourself fully engaged in

588
00:35:34.041 --> 00:35:36.620
your life.
If you do all these things incredibly well,

589
00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:40.080
can I ask you to do a little gentle stretches?
Roll your shoulders forwards.

590
00:35:40.081 --> 00:35:41.340
We're going to go to rocky now.

591
00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:44.640
Roll your shoulders forwards nice and gently and roll your shoulders back.

592
00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:48.180
Head to the left and head to the right,
up towards the ceiling,

593
00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:49.500
down towards your navel.

594
00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:52.080
Can I ask you a jog and Mason gently with your feet on the floor

595
00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:58.260
<v 2>faster but faster.</v>

596
00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:02.340
So what are your set and can I ask you to be boxing as you're sitting down rob?

597
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:05.580
De Faster,

598
00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:10.500
faster does ease off for a second.
When you get on your feet,
I want,

599
00:36:10.501 --> 00:36:12.510
you're bringing your past energy,
even smiling.

600
00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:15.410
You're boxing with your partners when you have a bit more fun.
So for example,

601
00:36:15.411 --> 00:36:19.290
what's your first name?
Hit it.
I'll be good.
Good man.
Headaches.

602
00:36:19.350 --> 00:36:23.450
Is that what you call it?
No,
it's hidden.
Okay.
Boxing.

603
00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:27.530
Don't you worry.
You shouldn't be slagging me to start slagging me at the end.

604
00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:30.710
Okay.
We're doing boxing.
You should be figuring that out.

605
00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:33.650
You should be using your intelligence to figure that out.
Okay.
Hands up.
Okay.

606
00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:36.500
If I say one hit number one.
Yeah.
What does that tell you?
That number two,

607
00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:41.480
how's he ever box before you can figure that out yourself.
Okay.
One,
two,
one,

608
00:36:41.481 --> 00:36:45.980
two,
one,
two,
one,
two.
Oh,

609
00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:49.010
oh,
oh,
okay.
I'm,
he's going to do it,

610
00:36:49.011 --> 00:36:51.800
but you're going to do it about five times faster than that.
I said,
okay,

611
00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:55.610
so get a partner quickly.
You're in the shadow boxing and too quickly.

612
00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:05.970
Well,
I know what you're saying.
You're too busy.
Look after energy.
See,

613
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:09.560
<v 0>I never forget.
25 years ago,</v>

614
00:37:09.561 --> 00:37:12.110
almost to the day a teacher,

615
00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:16.040
Northern Ireland again stood up and said something in an old basketball gym to

616
00:37:16.041 --> 00:37:17.140
all the boys.
It was a boy.

617
00:37:17.141 --> 00:37:21.170
Boys screw in the audience and he said of that had a profound impact on me for

618
00:37:21.171 --> 00:37:23.090
life and literally feel was 25 years.

619
00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:24.650
There's not a week's gone by you that I have one,

620
00:37:24.651 --> 00:37:28.790
three and five or six or seven or eight or sometimes I'm lucky 12 times a week

621
00:37:28.791 --> 00:37:32.700
when we were planning on a very high level.
Okay.
Not a single week on the,

622
00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:36.470
a very significant injury,
desiccated shoulder,
whatever injury or hot.
Okay.

623
00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:39.170
But he said something that had a profound impact on me for the rest of my life.

624
00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:43.450
He said,
how's is the crime on?
Well,

625
00:37:43.451 --> 00:37:47.370
the people's head,
the nobody sees other than the sec.

626
00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:50.060
That's a pretty big statement,
isn't it?

627
00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:56.320
How is the crime on weld people's head that nobody sees other than the second

628
00:37:57.860 --> 00:38:02.050
other words?
We don't really appreciate it.
On tennis,
gone on to that.

629
00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:04.400
Cardiac surgeon says,
if you don't make big changes,

630
00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:08.090
I ain't going to have to operate until somebody says,
actually,

631
00:38:08.091 --> 00:38:12.950
you're moving towards type two diabetes or until the personal trainer says your

632
00:38:12.951 --> 00:38:15.890
body fat is on the,
on CF territory.

633
00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:19.700
You're not creeping into 15 1617 18% and beyond.

634
00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:24.170
It's easier today.
It'd be healthy than at any stage in history.

635
00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:27.590
Unfortunately in Ireland and you guys are based in Ireland,

636
00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:31.400
we're really losing the obesity epidemic.
We're losing it badly.

637
00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:36.430
We don't need very advanced technology.
All we need is simple,
a skipping rope,

638
00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:41.350
a Kettlebell at home,
a bicycle to work in the morning,
a set of land skills,

639
00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:45.880
good food.
We don't need a lot of really cool,
sexy equipment set of dumbbells.

640
00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:47.950
Look at your diary,
plan out your month,

641
00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:50.320
get your hardware checked on a regular basis,

642
00:38:50.321 --> 00:38:54.370
use your smart technology even for motivation,
eat good food,

643
00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:57.970
measure stuff regularly and obviously use wearable technology.

644
00:38:58.390 --> 00:39:01.840
All of that equipment you could buy for about 150 bucks Max.

645
00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:06.010
How many of you need to get much more focused on that before we move towards

646
00:39:06.011 --> 00:39:09.340
year end and not even waiting until we start on January one or two.

647
00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:11.110
Hands up nice and high please.

648
00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:15.040
So I'm going to give you a bit five top tips in this capacity.

649
00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:19.720
And the five top tips are grounded in the best practice in the world in terms of

650
00:39:19.721 --> 00:39:24.340
longevity,
but also in terms of wellness.
Top tip one,
you need to eat well.

651
00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:25.750
90% of the time.

652
00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:31.110
Top tip to you need to be exercising five times a week for a minimum of 35

653
00:39:31.151 --> 00:39:33.040
minutes and you need to move constantly.

654
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:38.380
Top tip number three is you're asleep.
As we say in high performance sport,

655
00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:42.790
you're asleep is this secret silver bullet.
If you're not getting your sleep,

656
00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:45.940
it's going to impact all other aspects of performance and your health.

657
00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:49.960
Top tip number four is very much manage your stress.

658
00:39:49.961 --> 00:39:53.050
I don't even need to look at this anymore.
Manage your stress.
Shattered me.

659
00:39:53.051 --> 00:39:55.630
Scream at me.
Please are whisper at me.

660
00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:59.110
How can you manage stress better?
Cool.

661
00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:06.500
Meditation.
Who said meditation?
First of all,
this lady hit my phone.

662
00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:10.970
Who is it for you?
Then
I'm going to give you the credit anyway.

663
00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:16.500
Somebody else over here said meditation.
Who was that?
Good man.
Yeah,

664
00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:18.800
you give it to somebody at home and Masa.
Rhino clause.

665
00:40:22.610 --> 00:40:23.443
<v 1>Okay,
nice.</v>

666
00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:24.271
<v 0>Meditation.</v>

667
00:40:24.271 --> 00:40:29.271
If there's one tech at our ancient old ritual that I could stand over with 100%

668
00:40:29.461 --> 00:40:34.230
certainty that it works with 98% of people meditation.

669
00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:38.370
How many of you do meditation please?
Brilliant.
Please keep doing it.

670
00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:40.650
Please bed into your everyday rituals for everybody else.

671
00:40:40.890 --> 00:40:44.950
Please get curious about if there's a piece in the book about meditation on.

672
00:40:44.951 --> 00:40:49.440
Finally,
I know it's for all you,
Gen x and Gen y.

673
00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:53.040
It isn't so sexy and cool to talk about it,
but to watch your alcoholic,

674
00:40:53.041 --> 00:40:55.920
don't we throw on those shots and the all the time a few glasses of wine are

675
00:40:55.921 --> 00:40:59.040
very good,
your health,
but don't overdo it for obvious reasons.

676
00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:04.280
So as we draw to a close that say in 2017 and November,

677
00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:08.640
you're standing here on your thinking about what does the future hold for you?

678
00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:11.280
Are you going to get mine?
You're not going to get mine.

679
00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:13.170
You're going to have children or you're not gonna have children.

680
00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:15.240
Are you going to stay on Google for next 10 years?

681
00:41:15.241 --> 00:41:16.800
Are you going to go and start your own company?

682
00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:19.920
Are you going to be really healthy,
are perhaps,

683
00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:21.600
or you're not so sure about your future?

684
00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:25.410
Three of the big lessons they would be given the o and m principals would be

685
00:41:25.411 --> 00:41:29.220
number one,
your main set is going to be critical as you go on this journey,

686
00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:31.260
make sure you've got the right mindset.

687
00:41:31.261 --> 00:41:34.730
It's a bit like having the right equipment with you as you go in your journey.

688
00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:37.580
Number two,
if you don't have the energy,

689
00:41:37.581 --> 00:41:41.480
you're not going to be of the came nice and simple and you only have energy by

690
00:41:41.481 --> 00:41:44.480
doing the physical exercise,
but eating well by sleeping well,
by hydrate,

691
00:41:44.490 --> 00:41:46.970
unwell and so on.
If you don't have the energy,

692
00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:49.670
you don't have the capacity as we say it to to work,

693
00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:52.580
whether that's work time and through the mountains or whether that's work on

694
00:41:52.581 --> 00:41:53.360
relationships,

695
00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:56.780
whether that's work in sales or whether that's working in your technology.

696
00:41:57.050 --> 00:42:00.200
Let's say challenges.
You need energy to do work.

697
00:42:00.201 --> 00:42:04.520
The more energy have the more capacity.
How to do work,
that ass energy.

698
00:42:04.521 --> 00:42:08.080
You have less capacity.

699
00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:12.170
You have to do work.
I end of you to girl recently and she says,

700
00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:15.660
I've got loads of energy.
I've got an unbelievable passion for what to do.
I says,

701
00:42:15.661 --> 00:42:16.870
you must be fucking joke and I just,

702
00:42:20.290 --> 00:42:24.310
low energy,
low capacity to do work.

703
00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:27.730
There was nobody in the word who is not motivated.

704
00:42:27.731 --> 00:42:30.130
They just have a friend that purpose yet.
Does that make sense to you?

705
00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:33.530
If you're not motivated,
it's nothing wrong with you.
He was having fun.

706
00:42:33.531 --> 00:42:34.930
In your purpose of defining your purpose,

707
00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:38.170
you'll find passion and you find energy,
so your mission,

708
00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:42.040
please get your mission sort of between nine year and don't wear it to new years

709
00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:45.190
resolutions.
I'm pleased.
Have your small,

710
00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:49.010
your medium and your big goals and I don't just mean your Google,

711
00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:52.420
your Google goals.
What about your personal goals?

712
00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:57.520
Maybe an unbelievable weekend again to where with your friends and the Alps and

713
00:42:57.521 --> 00:42:59.380
March a once in a lifetime.

714
00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:02.740

00:47:04.930 --> 00:47:06.640
<v 0>So guys,
what?
What Juan said,
he is.</v>

761
00:47:07.010 --> 00:47:12.010
Imagine that for the next week everybody in this room made a commitment to

762
00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:15.820
challenge yourself and main set continually.
Whether it's getting feedback,

763
00:47:15.821 --> 00:47:17.530
whether it's when you're walking to meet and go.

764
00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:19.570
I'm going to try and be at my best in this meeting,

765
00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:22.320
whether it's when you're in the gym this evening,
your trend,

766
00:47:22.570 --> 00:47:25.600
bring your best energy into the gym rather than just in another gym session.

767
00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:30.760
Imagine the next week you're only sick to eat good quality and you're only sick

768
00:47:30.761 --> 00:47:34.030
to make sure you're having lots of water on board.
Obviously,

769
00:47:34.031 --> 00:47:35.440
even if your social items that make sense.

770
00:47:35.441 --> 00:47:37.990
So how have your few drinks but drink lots of water as well.

771
00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:42.790
Imagine the next week that you make sure that you start to think about your

772
00:47:42.791 --> 00:47:46.900
longterm goals for 2018 2019 and beyond,
right?

773
00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:48.280
I'm watching in the next week.

774
00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:50.830
You challenge yourself vigorously to go and get a coach.

775
00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:54.490
I don't care why they get an internally or externally on.
Finally,

776
00:47:54.491 --> 00:47:56.590
in the next week,
you create what I call a map,

777
00:47:56.591 --> 00:48:00.040
a massive action plan about how to unlock your potential.

778
00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:04.210
That's what commits abide,
a massive action plan of how you're gonna own luck.

779
00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:07.540
The most potential you can possibly get out of yourselves.

780
00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:11.260
Hands up on many things that would make a big impact in your life in a week and

781
00:48:11.261 --> 00:48:14.500
never main and on the main in a year,
and I've made in 10 2030 years,

782
00:48:14.770 --> 00:48:17.230
it'd be shown the agree.
Please scream yes and your language.

783
00:48:18.730 --> 00:48:21.460
So my call to action is those seals.

784
00:48:21.461 --> 00:48:25.840
People in the audience would know there must be a strong call to action at the

785
00:48:25.841 --> 00:48:28.000
end of every session in the next week.

786
00:48:28.001 --> 00:48:32.200
Can I ask you to take a massive action in terms of your main set massive action

787
00:48:32.201 --> 00:48:33.310
in terms of your energy and your fitness,

788
00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:37.290
your wellbeing and massive action in terms of actually having a big long term

789
00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:41.560
goal on there for a mission that you're chasing hard after because it's much

790
00:48:41.561 --> 00:48:43.720
easier to motivate yourself when you know what that is.

791
00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:48.100
That is my simple call to action.
We're going to finish with 60 seconds.

792
00:48:48.101 --> 00:48:52.690
We're going to blow this bloody roof off and 60 seconds in the islands there,

793
00:48:52.691 --> 00:48:56.950
a purse,
the chairs,
and nice and tight,
please.
Okay?

794
00:48:57.250 --> 00:48:59.080
You're going to get in your feet and you're going to shake.

795
00:48:59.081 --> 00:49:01.240
Every single person has rooms hand,

796
00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:05.000
but you're going do it in a very creative way.
It could be a high favor.

797
00:49:05.001 --> 00:49:08.200
It could be a low five,
it could be jumping up and double high five.

798
00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:10.690
But you must do with every single person,
the room.

799
00:49:10.930 --> 00:49:14.470
Bring your best energy and bring a little bit of form,
a little bit of Flair,

800
00:49:14.471 --> 00:49:15.580
and a little bit of creativity.

801
00:49:15.790 --> 00:49:19.160
You've got 60 seconds to raise the roof off this building.
Go.

802
00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:26.573
<v 1>So</v>

we're going to ask you to do it,
but five different poses.</v>

804
00:49:30.831 --> 00:49:35.210
Is that fair enough?
Okay,

Thank you very much guys for coming along today.
