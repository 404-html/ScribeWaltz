1
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.720
Hi everybody.
I'm Rachel Amera.
I'm based here in San Francisco.

2
00:00:11.721 --> 00:00:16.010
I'm really excited to be hosting our speaker today.

3
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.180
Carter cast a little bit about Carter.
He's here to talk about his book,

4
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.250
the right and wrong stuff.
And Carter just came in from Chicago.

5
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.290
I,
he is a professor at Northwestern university in the Kellogg School of

6
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.560
Management.

7
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.560
He is a active teacher in the entrepreneurship and business school courses

8
00:00:36.861 --> 00:00:38.630
there,
which is great.

9
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.400
He's also an established business veteran and venture capitalists.

10
00:00:43.401 --> 00:00:44.310
So,
uh,

11
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.330
Carter started his career at Pepsico and derailed,

12
00:00:49.521 --> 00:00:51.530
so we're going to hear more about that.
I think today.

13
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.030
I love that word derailed and landed on his feet obviously.

14
00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.030
He also,
uh,
was the chief marketing officer,

15
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.780
founder of uh,
Blue Nile.

16
00:01:02.781 --> 00:01:07.160
So if you actually remember that company from the days of the heyday,

17
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.570
uh,
I do.

18
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.410
Then he was one of those integrity people from there and work with Doubleclick

19
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:13.960
as they were,
uh,

20
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
active with Blue Nile and also worked as the CEO,

21
00:01:19.431 --> 00:01:22.760
well@theceoofwalmart.com.
So a lot of experience.

22
00:01:22.761 --> 00:01:27.290
We're super excited to hear about what he's going to share today about careers

23
00:01:27.291 --> 00:01:31.280
and derailing and getting back on track.
So please welcome Carter cast.

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.140
<v 0>Thank you.</v>

25
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.320
<v 2>One of the questions I get is why would you write a book about failure?</v>

26
00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.940
Uh,

27
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.940
so let me tell you what peaked my interest in this topic was I had a,

28
00:01:48.491 --> 00:01:52.180
uh,
I lost touch with an old boss and he was super fancy,
you know,

29
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.950
the right schools and super smart and I lost touch with them.

30
00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.820
And about 10 years after,
uh,
the last time we met,

31
00:02:00.821 --> 00:02:04.060
I called him up and I asked him,
you know,
how's,
how's your wife?
How's your kids?

32
00:02:04.061 --> 00:02:06.850
And then I said,
how's your career?
You know,
what are you doing?

33
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.570
And there was this disappointment in his voice when he talked about his career

34
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.090
and he hadn't reached the expected level of achievement that I thought he would

35
00:02:16.091 --> 00:02:18.550
and that probably other people thought too.

36
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.180
So we hung up the phone and I literally wrote on a sticky note,

37
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.790
what impedes the progress of talented people?

38
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.840
And I stuck it on my wall at Northwestern and then I decided it was such a,

39
00:02:31.511 --> 00:02:35.830
it's sort of a provocative question for me that I asked the dean of the business

40
00:02:35.831 --> 00:02:40.030
school if I could take a quarter off from teaching and just research and see are

41
00:02:40.031 --> 00:02:44.440
there certain behavioral traits or skill gaps,

42
00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.240
certain themes that account for people that are good,

43
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.180
not achieving their expected level of development.

44
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.870
And so what I found is there are,

45
00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.470
and then I flipped the topic on its head and I looked at what do high performers

46
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.370
that don't derail,
what do they've got,
what's the right stuff?

47
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.190
And so one of the major ways I did this,

48
00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:11.650
but I interviewed a hundred people that got fired or demoted.

49
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.760
I talked to a lot of coaches,
HR,
vps,

50
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.370
executive recruiters,
Ceos.

51
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.240
But I also mind three 60 a research databases.

52
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.070
So I looked at three like thousands and thousands of three sixties and teased

53
00:03:27.071 --> 00:03:30.670
out the difference between people in the top 10% you know,

54
00:03:30.671 --> 00:03:34.420
like people that were at the top 10% and managerial effectiveness.

55
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.760
What was their competency profile set versus people that were rated in the top

56
00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:41.020
and the bottom core tile.

57
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.800
And I found that there's these very specific competencies they have.

58
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.800
What's Kinda cool is it's not like a good at everything.

59
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.160
There's only a couple of things that these people are good at,

60
00:03:51.161 --> 00:03:53.830
but they're good at these things.
Consistency consistently.

61
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.660
I don't get into those.
Okay,

62
00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.960
so what I thought we do here is I will go on and talk for about 30 minutes and

63
00:04:02.291 --> 00:04:04.030
I'm going to go over these five reasons.

64
00:04:04.031 --> 00:04:09.031
I found that people run into trouble and then we'll take a break and have

65
00:04:09.491 --> 00:04:13.780
questions and then I'll far last 10 or 15 minutes,
I'll talk about the wrong,

66
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.850
the right stuff.
What people that do well,
what these competencies are.
Okay.

67
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.390
So we'll get to look at both sides of the question.

68
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.250
We're going to look at why do talented people derail,

69
00:04:24.251 --> 00:04:27.820
but also what do high performers do?
Very specifically,
that's different.

70
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.600
So first of all,
this is not a niche topic.

71
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.130
Half to two thirds of us will have a derailment event.

72
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.630
Either we'll get demoted or fired.
I did.
So I'll talk about that very honestly.

73
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.740
Um,
let me talk about definitions.

74
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:46.660
When I talk about derailment,

75
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.650
I'm talking about people who didn't reach the expected level of achievement by

76
00:04:50.651 --> 00:04:55.030
the HR Department or by their boss.
So they're not people.
By the way,

77
00:04:55.031 --> 00:04:57.130
this is not a personal derailment.

78
00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.140
I did not look in this Dataset at people that derailed because they loved living

79
00:05:02.141 --> 00:05:06.520
in boulder and they wanted to stay in boulder so they didn't take a move or they

80
00:05:06.521 --> 00:05:09.460
are triathletes and they wanted to work out and they'll know wanting to work 20

81
00:05:09.461 --> 00:05:13.390
hours a week or they had to take care of their kids and they worked three days a

82
00:05:13.391 --> 00:05:14.620
week.
If they,

83
00:05:14.621 --> 00:05:18.250
if they made personal decisions that accounted for a quote unquote derailment,

84
00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:19.660
that was their decision.

85
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.500
I'm looking here at people that wanted the brass ring and we're working their

86
00:05:23.501 --> 00:05:26.650
tail off and didn't get it.
What happens?
Okay.

87
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.750
The second caveat to this is I found in looking at all this research for three

88
00:05:31.751 --> 00:05:36.250
years,
that organizations are complicit.
They move people too quickly,

89
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.670
they ignore bad behavior.

90
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:45.150
If the person's hitting their numbers and they don't require superiors to

91
00:05:46.511 --> 00:05:49.720
develop subordinates like they used to,
you know,

92
00:05:49.721 --> 00:05:52.870
you could say maybe part of that's the GIG economy.

93
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.920
But the problem is as a result employees,

94
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.300
us,
we aren't getting the feedback we need in most organizations.

95
00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:06.560
So I think it's wonderful that you do events like this so you can get,

96
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.780
you can hear from a wide variety of people.

97
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.740
So here are the five reasons I found over and over and over in the research to

98
00:06:15.051 --> 00:06:18.730
make this more palatable and a little less sort of like jarring.
Like you,

99
00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.180
you know,
instead of saying,
oh I suffer from it,
or personal,
you know,
issues,

100
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.120
you could say,
I have a little bit of captain fantastic in me.

101
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.350
So I created these archetypes to make the topic less,
you know,

102
00:06:30.351 --> 00:06:33.800
kind of less difficult.
So here's the first reason.

103
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:36.170
This is captain fantastic.

104
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.060
This is the fellow who bruises you on his quest for the holy grail of the corner

105
00:06:41.061 --> 00:06:44.720
office.
He's ego driven,
he's dismissive,

106
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.300
he's got poor listening skills.
I me,

107
00:06:48.301 --> 00:06:53.301
mine is his mantra and we've all experienced him and he usually does well

108
00:06:53.361 --> 00:06:57.010
because he's a self promoter that then he hits a wall at a certain point and

109
00:06:57.011 --> 00:07:01.370
because he gets in a complex assignment where he needs the enlistment of other

110
00:07:01.371 --> 00:07:03.170
people and they don't want to work with them.

111
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.070
And eventually you'll see that he was moved to special projects.

112
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.950
And then from there,
six weeks later,
he's no longer in the building.

113
00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:14.600
We know this guy.
So he has a relational issues,

114
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:19.220
overly ambitious,
driven by ego.
Now let's say you're not this person,

115
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:23.900
there's another aspect of this interpersonal issues I want want you to,

116
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.400
maybe you should pay attention to.

117
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.180
So this woman named Karen Horne,

118
00:07:29.181 --> 00:07:34.181
I was a clinical psychiatrist in the forties and fifties and she did a lot of

119
00:07:35.001 --> 00:07:37.400
work with people that have everyday neuroses.

120
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.600
She found that we have three tendencies under pressure.

121
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.590
We do three things that self sabotage.
She said,

122
00:07:45.591 --> 00:07:50.540
we either move away from people when times are difficult.
We,
um,

123
00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:54.080
we distance ourselves were skeptics were cautious,

124
00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:56.150
we move against,

125
00:07:56.151 --> 00:08:01.151
people were combative or we moved towards people by being ingratiating.

126
00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:05.060
So that's Karen Horne.
I,

127
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:10.330
so Robert and Joyce Hogan took her work and develop the Hogan Development

128
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:11.450
System,

129
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:16.450
which is a very powerful tool that looks at a whole variety of things from goals

130
00:08:16.731 --> 00:08:19.610
to potential to derailment propensities.

131
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:25.150
And they took her work and they found these 11 specific behavioral traits that

132
00:08:28.041 --> 00:08:31.730
happen to all of us under pressure.

133
00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:36.200
We do one of 11 things.
We will you see that first block,

134
00:08:36.201 --> 00:08:37.820
excitable skeptic cautious.

135
00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:42.940
That is the moving away from that Karen Horne I found then that next block is

136
00:08:44.181 --> 00:08:48.320
the moving against by being mischievous or arrogant or melodramatic.

137
00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:51.980
And then the last block is moving towards by being ingratiating.

138
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:58.020
All of us do at least one of these things.
I've taken this test,

139
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.860
I had to,
my sister's taking it,
she had a couple,

140
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:07.080
we created this Zell fellows,
um,
Sam Zell.

141
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:12.390
We created a program at Kellogg and we take high potential entrepreneurs and we

142
00:09:12.391 --> 00:09:15.060
put them in this bootcamp program called Zelle scholars.

143
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:20.010
And we make all of the Zell scholars take this and all of them have some of

144
00:09:20.011 --> 00:09:22.640
these tendencies cause you know we're human.
We're going to have some,

145
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:27.330
the question is do you understand your own so that they don't hurt you?

146
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:34.100
So there is a recent Harvard business review article two weeks ago,

147
00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.960
um,
e.
E.
U.
R.
I.
C.
H.

148
00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:43.410
She did this Meta analysis on self awareness.
You ought to get,

149
00:09:43.411 --> 00:09:47.040
it's a great article.
And,
and she said there's two types of self awareness,

150
00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:48.240
internal self awareness.

151
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:52.020
Do we understand ourselves to understand our motives and our weaknesses and our

152
00:09:52.021 --> 00:09:55.490
strengths,
our vulnerabilities and there's external self awareness.

153
00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:57.870
Do we understand how we're viewed by other people?

154
00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:02.700
And she said that 10 to 15% of us have self awareness,

155
00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:05.520
10 to 15% of us,

156
00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:09.030
85 to 90% of US lack self awareness.

157
00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:13.770
So the Hogan is a great way to understand where you might have some of these

158
00:10:13.771 --> 00:10:16.410
interpersonal areas that are holding you back.

159
00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:20.430
Here's a guy right about this time.

160
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.640
This guy derailed.
This is me,

161
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:29.750
right about 29 or 30 and I was called into my bosses office during my annual

162
00:10:31.201 --> 00:10:35.460
performance review.
He told me I was insubordinate,
I was at Frito Lay,

163
00:10:35.461 --> 00:10:38.520
I was a senior marketing manager.
He said,
you're insubordinate,

164
00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:42.370
you don't take my direction.
Well you're a calcitrant.
I had to look that up.

165
00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:46.200
I know wasn't quite sure what that meant and I want you off my team.

166
00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:51.360
And I said,
Mike,
I'll call him Mike because that was his name.
Mike,

167
00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:56.280
Mike,
are you firing me?
And he said,
not technically,

168
00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:58.710
but good luck finding somebody who wants you in their group.

169
00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:05.240
And so I took two weeks off and I talked to my dad.

170
00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:10.080
I said,
Dad,
what do I do?
You know,
can you believe this guy?
And he said,

171
00:11:10.081 --> 00:11:13.170
well your mother and I are amaze,
you've made it seven years in a corporation.

172
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.330
So he wasn't much help.

173
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:19.560
So I decided to go back to Frito lay cause I didn't want to end on that kind of

174
00:11:19.561 --> 00:11:20.394
a note.

175
00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:26.090
And I came back and found that I had this reputation for being difficult to

176
00:11:26.401 --> 00:11:30.570
manage.
And I finally found this guy that would take me in his group.

177
00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:33.240
He's a Canadian,
he just moved from Canada.

178
00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:38.330
So he didn't know my reputation and he took me in and he helped me.

179
00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:44.630
But what happened was I took this Hogan and I had these two traits that if I

180
00:11:45.061 --> 00:11:48.360
would've known about and would have been able to manage more effectively,

181
00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:51.270
I probably wouldn't have run into this trouble with my boss.

182
00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:55.000
This trade of leisurely is,
it's a weird word,
leisurely.

183
00:11:55.001 --> 00:11:58.990
It's basically when the heavy hand of authority pushes on you,

184
00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:01.720
you tend to sort of blow that,
blow it off.
You know,

185
00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:06.070
I may or I may not follow the direction that my bosses suggesting

186
00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.450
and mischievous and my case,
which is,
you know,

187
00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:13.990
let's throw a grenade in this meeting just to liven it up,
you know?

188
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:19.630
And so these traits,
I had served me poorly with a,

189
00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:24.020
uh,
a bureaucratic system and a heavy handed boss.
And I derailed and,

190
00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:27.130
and my point in sharing this story with you is,

191
00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:29.200
if I would have understood this about myself,

192
00:12:29.201 --> 00:12:33.310
I think I could have rained this in once I understood this about myself,

193
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:36.970
that trait,
those traits,
I still have them.

194
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:40.840
I still have the tendency but they don't come out to play as much because I'm

195
00:12:40.841 --> 00:12:44.380
aware of them and I'm aware of certain situations that stoke them,

196
00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:49.330
so that is the first one,
captain.
Fantastic.

197
00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:53.920
Even if you aren't that cat that's this arrogant and ego driven,

198
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:58.990
you still probably have one of those 11 Hogan traits that you've got to watch

199
00:12:58.991 --> 00:12:59.824
out for,

200
00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:05.250
so there's a good book called why CEOs fail

201
00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:09.310
by dot.
Lich and Kero,
c a I,

202
00:13:09.311 --> 00:13:14.311
r o and in that they take the 11 Hogan traits and they list specific questions

203
00:13:15.101 --> 00:13:18.700
you can ask yourself to see if you have any of them and you will,

204
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:21.010
so it's the devil you know here.

205
00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:25.360
Second reason people fail that first one by the way,

206
00:13:25.361 --> 00:13:29.920
is more in men and it's often as you get to be higher and higher level,

207
00:13:29.921 --> 00:13:34.180
you stop listening to people because you think you have the answers and you

208
00:13:34.181 --> 00:13:35.080
start thinking,

209
00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:39.000
you start thinking that you know it and you don't seek feedback from the front

210
00:13:39.001 --> 00:13:41.800
line who always have the answers because they're closest to the customer.

211
00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:47.410
The second one is the Solo Flyer.
This happens usually pretty early in careers.

212
00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:50.590
What happens is you get a strong individual contributor,

213
00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:54.070
they get promoted and they still try to do all the work themselves,

214
00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:57.910
so they micromanage.

215
00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:02.500
They usually fail to develop their team.

216
00:14:02.501 --> 00:14:06.400
They tat they hand out tasks but they don't develop the people.

217
00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:10.480
Lominger limited is a company that does talent management Lominger.

218
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:13.450
They were just bought by Korn ferry recently.

219
00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:18.520
Lameer looks at 67 managerial competencies.
It's a lot.

220
00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:21.400
You know most companies looking at about 10 they have 10 I don't know how many

221
00:14:21.401 --> 00:14:22.234
Google has,

222
00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:27.660
but 67 of 67 in terms of managerial effectiveness developing others.

223
00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:32.980
It's the lowest rated trait by managers.

224
00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:38.530
So the chances are pretty good that you know you aren't going to get ma,

225
00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:42.190
you aren't going to be developed well and so you have to do it yourself.

226
00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:46.090
The other thing that was interesting and looking at this cause you get the micro

227
00:14:46.091 --> 00:14:49.630
managing,
you have to learn to let go.
Actually Linda Hill,

228
00:14:49.631 --> 00:14:51.100
this professor at Harvard said,

229
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:54.320
getting promoted into management from being an individual contributor is

230
00:14:54.321 --> 00:14:56.660
literally a transformation of identity.

231
00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:02.030
We have to learn from to go from doing to enabling and it's hard when you're

232
00:15:02.031 --> 00:15:04.610
good at doing,
it's hard to let go of the doing.

233
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.210
So this third one though was interesting to me.

234
00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:13.730
Linda Hill also found,
she wrote this book called becoming a manager.

235
00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:18.830
She followed 20 managers around who just got promoted and she saw like

236
00:15:18.831 --> 00:15:22.040
ethnographic research kind of followed him around,
took notes like Jane Goodall,

237
00:15:22.041 --> 00:15:24.530
dead in gorillas and the mess,
you know,
watching.

238
00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:30.100
And she said that one of the things managers did poorly was they didn't realize

239
00:15:30.921 --> 00:15:34.730
that it's one thing for me to manage you and it's one thing for me,

240
00:15:34.731 --> 00:15:36.950
another thing for me to manage our,
this team here,

241
00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:41.660
but at least half my time as a manager should be enabling this team to be

242
00:15:41.661 --> 00:15:46.430
effective by building bridges to other functions where we have dependencies and

243
00:15:46.431 --> 00:15:48.770
so that she caused that managing context.

244
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:54.170
Are you managing the context surrounding your team?
Are you building bridges?

245
00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:59.180
So I asked people if you list your key initiatives that you're working on and

246
00:15:59.181 --> 00:16:02.540
you knew listed next to them where you have the people that you have

247
00:16:02.541 --> 00:16:05.450
dependencies on and then you list next to them,

248
00:16:05.451 --> 00:16:09.140
what's your contact strategy with those people?
Are you taking them to lunch?

249
00:16:09.141 --> 00:16:12.620
Are you taking them to coffee?
When's the last time you interacted with them?

250
00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:17.390
You've got to be managing the context because obviously you know business is a

251
00:16:17.391 --> 00:16:21.920
team sport,
so we have all these dependencies crossfunctionally that we rely on.

252
00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:24.500
Solo Flyer doesn't understand that yet.

253
00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:31.900
So the third reason for derailment is version 1.0 and this one sort of

254
00:16:34.611 --> 00:16:39.470
terrifying.
This happens a lot mid career.
You get these,

255
00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:41.060
you get complacent in your job,

256
00:16:41.061 --> 00:16:46.061
you're good at your job and you kind of dial down your curiosity and you don't

257
00:16:47.181 --> 00:16:52.181
stay up to speed on cryptocurrency and you aren't quite sure how AI might apply

258
00:16:52.821 --> 00:16:54.530
to your customer service business.

259
00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:58.550
You don't understand what audible is doing to disrupt the subscription model.

260
00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:00.260
You know,
to disrupt the publishing model,

261
00:17:00.261 --> 00:17:05.261
you just don't stay current and you become this fossilized dinosaur guy that's

262
00:17:06.231 --> 00:17:11.000
version 1.0 so he suffers from changing circumstances,

263
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:14.660
lack of adaptability a lot of times to technological change,

264
00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:16.670
but sometimes it's another kind of change.

265
00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:20.360
He's not adaptable to getting a new boss.
When I derailed,

266
00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:25.460
I was doing really well with my old boss and he was a very empowering boss.

267
00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:27.920
When I got the new boss who was more participative,

268
00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:32.930
I had organ rejection and I lost.
He didn't lose.

269
00:17:32.931 --> 00:17:35.420
I lost.
So that's the first one.

270
00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:38.270
Then the other one is just making sure you stay curious.

271
00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:42.440
So I ask people that might suffer from this.

272
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:46.310
How well are you honing your discovery skills?

273
00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:51.780
Are you this based on work from Clayton Christianson of Harvard,

274
00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:56.520
he looked at executives that have either delivery skills.

275
00:17:56.550 --> 00:18:00.300
He found the kind of neatly breakout into delivery skills and discovery skills.

276
00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:04.830
Delivery skills are like analyzing,
um,

277
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:07.710
executing,
communicating,

278
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.770
aligning and discovery skills or these five.

279
00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:16.610
So how well are he also found that people that are innovative have a ratio of

280
00:18:17.671 --> 00:18:21.240
six to one on questions asked to statements made,

281
00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:26.700
so they ask a lot of questions,
a lot of what if and how might we questions.

282
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.880
They also observe customers.
They go out in the field,

283
00:18:29.881 --> 00:18:34.050
they go out in the market and they watch customers interact with the product to

284
00:18:34.051 --> 00:18:36.510
understand what problems are they facing,

285
00:18:36.511 --> 00:18:39.780
what kind of work arounds are they doing,
how can they improve the product?

286
00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:42.270
One time I spent some time,
I take,

287
00:18:42.271 --> 00:18:45.240
I teach this class that's all about this stuff called new venture discovery at

288
00:18:45.241 --> 00:18:49.800
Kellogg.
You might know the shoe.
All birds that came out of my class,

289
00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:54.630
that was a student in my class that invented this shoe.
In our class,

290
00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:58.500
we build prototypes.
We go out in the market.
We test these rough prototypes,

291
00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:03.090
digital prototypes.
Then we build,
you know,
physical prototypes,
kind of Ido,

292
00:19:03.091 --> 00:19:04.020
ask research.

293
00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:08.250
Tim Brown developed all birds doing a lot of this observational research.

294
00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:12.720
One time I was with this guy who was the product manager on an adult diaper

295
00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:17.580
brand.
We are spending doing some research with with him.
And I said,
well,

296
00:19:17.581 --> 00:19:20.310
what's it like to,
how long have you been on the business?
He said,
for years.

297
00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:24.990
I said,
what's it like to wear the diapers?
And he said,
well,
I'm not incontinent.

298
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:28.640
And I said,
I know,
but like if you to put on the diapers and the UPN them,

299
00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:31.530
what's it like when you walk around with that on?
And he said,

300
00:19:31.531 --> 00:19:33.450
well I've never done that.
And I said,

301
00:19:33.451 --> 00:19:35.670
how do you understand what your customer is going through if you're not wearing

302
00:19:35.671 --> 00:19:39.150
the product?
So you know,
be the discovery.

303
00:19:39.151 --> 00:19:42.030
Research is being out in the shoes of the customer and seeing what they

304
00:19:42.031 --> 00:19:44.730
experience.
It's also experimenting.

305
00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:48.480
I know Google is very good at this and Amazon is very good at this.

306
00:19:48.481 --> 00:19:50.670
Bayzos once said,
I haven't failed.

307
00:19:50.671 --> 00:19:54.750
I've just found a thousand things that don't work.
You know,
this is ab testing.

308
00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:58.650
This is building rough prototypes and getting him out in the hands of customers

309
00:19:58.651 --> 00:20:00.000
and watching them interact with them.

310
00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:04.110
Experimenting also another aspect of discovery skills.

311
00:20:04.111 --> 00:20:06.750
That version 1.0 could use is networking.

312
00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:12.440
Really establishing a strong set of relationships with people that have a

313
00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:16.920
diverse backgrounds that can help you problem solve.

314
00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:20.460
So really working on your networking skills is very important.

315
00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:25.800
And then the big kind of the Mac daddy of them all is associational thinking.

316
00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:30.270
Your ability to synthesize diverse inputs.
So this is,

317
00:20:30.271 --> 00:20:35.271
you know the example people give is like a George Ms Straw walking his sheep dog

318
00:20:35.371 --> 00:20:39.330
in the Alps and then he comes home and he picks the burrs out of the dog and he

319
00:20:39.331 --> 00:20:44.010
comes up with
velcro.
Yeah,
associational thinking.

320
00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:48.940
Uh,
Einstein said creativity is nothing more than common.
A tutorial play.

321
00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:55.350
So version 1.0 lacks this discovery orientation and it's hurting his

322
00:20:55.691 --> 00:21:00.250
effectiveness.
The fourth reason I found that people derail is,

323
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:02.500
is this archetype is the one trick pony.

324
00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:07.060
This is someone who's very competent at one thing,
but they haven't broadened.

325
00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:11.530
So maybe it's a controller who would love to be the CFO,

326
00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:16.120
but she knows accounting.
She's,
she got us off quickbooks and our startup,

327
00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:20.620
she's great with the audits,
but she doesn't understand.

328
00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:25.480
She doesn't have any exposure to forecasting or to capital asset management to

329
00:21:25.481 --> 00:21:27.280
long range strategic planning.

330
00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:30.880
And she's not going to get the CFO job that she'd like because she hasn't

331
00:21:30.881 --> 00:21:31.840
broadened enough.

332
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:35.830
So this is a derailer that hits us a lot of times mid career too.

333
00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:40.420
We've gone narrowly up a path,
which is smart because we've become an expert,

334
00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:44.980
but at some point we have to start broadening our skillset and our experience

335
00:21:44.981 --> 00:21:49.120
that if we want to be able to keep rising up through the organization,

336
00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:53.320
this person suffers from over dependence on one skill.

337
00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:57.460
So there's sort of lopsided and they haven't broadened their skillset.

338
00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:01.750
They also may have a key skill deficiency in an area that's really important to

339
00:22:01.751 --> 00:22:04.870
the business.
So for example,
if you're at

340
00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:12.750
electronic arts,
it's a local business.
If you're an ea like I was,
what do,
yeah.

341
00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:17.170
Where,
where,
what do you have to know?
Even no matter what department you're in,

342
00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:22.440
you have to know what something about what you have to understand game play.

343
00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:27.310
You have to understand,
um,
how a great game is made,

344
00:22:27.311 --> 00:22:30.850
how you can make a game addictive.
And 50 strokes is what they say at ea.

345
00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.250
If you're at Frito lay,

346
00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:38.970
you have to understand sales and distribution because that company is built on

347
00:22:39.491 --> 00:22:44.491
25,000 route salespeople putting the product everywhere you've got,

348
00:22:44.621 --> 00:22:46.170
understand that she has,

349
00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:50.530
could have a key skill deficiency in an area that's important to business and

350
00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:51.640
she doesn't have,

351
00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:56.760
she hasn't had enough experiences that give her the ability to see the big

352
00:22:57.461 --> 00:23:01.540
picture and solve complex problems by understanding the role of different

353
00:23:01.541 --> 00:23:03.100
functions play in an organization.

354
00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:06.910
So let's say I had this one trick pony in my group and I'm at Walmart

355
00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:11.650
and this is the feedback she's gotten and she's,
I'm mentoring her.

356
00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:16.840
I might do something like this now,
this is my only wonky slide,
so forgive me.

357
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:21.460
It's my one business wonky slide.
So let's look at this.
I might say Gail,

358
00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:26.230
let's say her name is Gail Gail.
Let's lay out the critical path of Walmart.

359
00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:27.730
What's the critical path?

360
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000
The critical path are the key activities in any company that add value to the

361
00:23:33.011 --> 00:23:37.000
customer.
Okay.
What are the key activities at Walmart?

362
00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:41.050
We would write down sourcing,
merchandising,

363
00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:43.690
ops and store operations.

364
00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:47.600
Then we would say within those areas,

365
00:23:47.601 --> 00:23:51.950
what are the critical things we do that we gotta be good at to win?

366
00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:57.140
And we would write down supplier negotiation cause you got under negotiate for

367
00:23:57.141 --> 00:24:00.980
Edlp,
every day,
low price assortment planning.
Good,
better,

368
00:24:00.981 --> 00:24:03.290
best for the assortment,
right?

369
00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:09.170
Making sure you're in stock on the products under logistics,

370
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:12.050
inbound and outbound warehouse management.

371
00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:14.550
What's the inventory software that allows the product to,

372
00:24:14.551 --> 00:24:18.260
can flow in and out of these big warehouses and inside the store,

373
00:24:18.261 --> 00:24:22.310
two critical areas are planograms,
merchandising,
Action Alley,

374
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:27.710
and managing the 700 people that are inside of a supercenter.

375
00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:32.300
So those might be six of the things we write down that are critical path

376
00:24:32.301 --> 00:24:37.160
activities at Walmart.
And I said,
Gail,
do you understand these activities?

377
00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:42.170
No.
You know,
let's say I'm,
she's a controller who wants to become the CFO.

378
00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:46.010
I'd say,
well,
how about we set up time

379
00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:52.100
a day a day with somebody who's an expert in each one of these places in the

380
00:24:52.101 --> 00:24:56.090
company.
They'd love to have you tag along and watched them for a day.

381
00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:58.340
So in the next two months,

382
00:24:58.370 --> 00:25:03.370
we're going to take six days in the next two months for you to get exposure with

383
00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:07.460
a store manager on how they manage the Labor,

384
00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:12.710
understanding the planigram philosophy around how we merchandise inside of a

385
00:25:12.711 --> 00:25:16.640
store,
get inside of a warehouse and understand inventory,

386
00:25:16.641 --> 00:25:17.870
controls and management.

387
00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:22.580
I guarantee you after she has those experiences,

388
00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:25.160
there's nobody that's going to say she's,

389
00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:29.690
she's non strategic because she's going to understand the company and the

390
00:25:29.691 --> 00:25:34.070
critical path of activities that create value to the customer.
So I would,

391
00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:37.160
I would ask you guys,
you know,
the rhetorical question,

392
00:25:37.161 --> 00:25:41.510
what are the critical path activities at Google and do you understand them

393
00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:45.170
regardless of what function you're in,
whether you're an engineer,

394
00:25:45.171 --> 00:25:47.030
you're in sales,
sales and marketing,

395
00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:51.770
do you understand the key activities that Google does to create differentiation

396
00:25:51.771 --> 00:25:56.590
in the market?
And if you don't talk to people who have a nice purview,

397
00:25:57.090 --> 00:26:01.670
relist those key activities down and just start familiarizing yourself with

398
00:26:01.671 --> 00:26:05.420
those areas that are outside of your function so you broaden your view on the

399
00:26:05.421 --> 00:26:07.700
business.
This is a very,

400
00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:12.920
very solvable derailment area.
Captain.

401
00:26:12.921 --> 00:26:16.220
Fantastic is tougher because that's a behavioral issue,
right?

402
00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:20.390
That person is going to probably have to have a two by four upside the head

403
00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:24.620
before he realizes that his ego run a mock is not going to serve them well.

404
00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:26.720
This one you can fix,

405
00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:31.940
so the last one and then we'll take a little break and we'll talk about some of

406
00:26:31.941 --> 00:26:34.460
these.
This is the whirling dervish.

407
00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:38.840
This person doesn't deliver on promises.

408
00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:43.890
Usually it's a very creatively minded person whose are bigger than their

409
00:26:43.891 --> 00:26:47.040
stomach.
They take on too much.

410
00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:51.330
They usually have poor organizational skills.

411
00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:53.730
They don't have a system.

412
00:26:53.731 --> 00:26:56.970
They should probably re David Allen's book getting things done.

413
00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:01.830
They have trouble prioritizing what are the key activities that I should really

414
00:27:01.831 --> 00:27:03.330
focus on that move the needle,

415
00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:06.900
the high leverage activities and which are the ones I can blow off because we

416
00:27:06.901 --> 00:27:08.430
can never get all our stuff done,

417
00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:12.060
so they need to prioritize their a bs and cs and hit the A's hard.

418
00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:16.620
Probably ignore the seas.
They probably don't understand process management.

419
00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:20.010
If you ask them to look at their projects and do a Gantt chart on them,

420
00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:24.750
they probably wouldn't be able to go cradle the grave what the key activities

421
00:27:24.751 --> 00:27:28.320
are and how long they take.
So they might say to the boss,
yeah,

422
00:27:28.321 --> 00:27:30.660
I can get that done by June.
No,
no,
no.

423
00:27:30.661 --> 00:27:33.570
F we're not going to get FDA approval on the product til May.

424
00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:35.670
Then we've got an order packaging film.

425
00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:39.630
We've got to move the product and the supply chain.
By the time it goes on shelf,

426
00:27:39.631 --> 00:27:43.200
it's going to be December,
not June.
They don't understand the critical path

427
00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:48.890
and often they're pleasers who can't say no,
and this is one of my behavior.

428
00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:53.930
This is another one of my derailment areas is I overextend by saying yes to too

429
00:27:54.361 --> 00:27:58.860
many things.
So a good trick there is,
first of all,

430
00:27:58.861 --> 00:28:02.340
I love the book the power of a positive no,

431
00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:06.510
that's by a guy named William Ury who wrote getting to yes,

432
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:09.210
the book on negotiations.
He's a Harvard professor.

433
00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:12.540
He says in the power of a positive note.

434
00:28:12.541 --> 00:28:15.930
Remember when you say no to something you're saying yes to something else that's

435
00:28:15.931 --> 00:28:16.764
important to you.

436
00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:21.030
So I might be saying yes to my kids dinner with my kids and my wife.

437
00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:23.700
I might be saying yes to a workout for my stiff neck.

438
00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:28.890
So that's one thing I always remember as a reformed pleaser.

439
00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:33.510
Another one is Adam Grant talks about this in his book,
give and take.

440
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:38.340
He talks about the five minute favor.
Maybe you say no,

441
00:28:38.341 --> 00:28:42.570
but you spiff them,
you help somebody out.
So it's not a cold,
harsh,
no.

442
00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:43.950
I'll give an example of this.

443
00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:48.980
I was just asked to go to Seattle to give a presentation to high potential

444
00:28:50.941 --> 00:28:52.200
Kellogg prospects.

445
00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:56.940
And I'm in the middle of this book tour and I'm teaching two classes and I'm a

446
00:28:56.941 --> 00:28:59.340
venture capitalist.
I don't have time.
I didn't have time,

447
00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:02.280
but I told the director of admissions,
I can't go to,

448
00:29:02.281 --> 00:29:04.380
I can't fly out to Seattle from Chicago,

449
00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:09.270
but if you tell me the three or four or five people that you meet there that are

450
00:29:09.271 --> 00:29:13.080
entrepreneurial,
I'll call them and I'll try to convince them to come to Kellogg.

451
00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:15.240
So instead of a two day commitment,

452
00:29:15.241 --> 00:29:17.250
I turned it into a three or four hour commitment.

453
00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:21.210
So that's like a five minute favor.
So

454
00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:27.450
these are
the five captain.

455
00:29:27.451 --> 00:29:31.590
Fantastic,
ego-driven doesn't listen.

456
00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:34.440
You know what Saint Francis of Assisi said,

457
00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:36.750
seek to understand before being understood.

458
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:39.900
It doesn't get that interpersonal issues.

459
00:29:39.901 --> 00:29:42.070
But remember you might not be a captain.
Fantastic.

460
00:29:42.071 --> 00:29:47.071
And you might still have one of those derailment traits that Hogan has in those

461
00:29:47.351 --> 00:29:51.520
11 descriptors.
Does it build and lead teams?

462
00:29:51.521 --> 00:29:53.440
That's often earlier in a career,

463
00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:57.760
super good individual contributor that gets a team and still tries to do the

464
00:29:57.761 --> 00:29:58.660
work themselves.

465
00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:04.480
Version 1.0 which is that a problem with adaptability and often a problem with

466
00:30:04.481 --> 00:30:05.920
learning stick.
Got It.

467
00:30:05.921 --> 00:30:08.830
I doubt that's going to affect you guys cause you're probably very curious.

468
00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:12.730
But staying curious and not getting set in your ways is a,

469
00:30:12.731 --> 00:30:16.960
is a definitely a derail a Drell for most people being narrow.

470
00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:20.890
That one trick pony going up in a vertical in a vertical way instead of taking

471
00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:25.030
lateral moves to get more experienced or raising your hand to be on a task force

472
00:30:25.031 --> 00:30:27.070
to gain your exposure to other areas.

473
00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:31.840
And then the whirling dervish which has trouble delivering on promises because

474
00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:35.800
they overextend.
So maybe we stop there.

475
00:30:35.801 --> 00:30:40.801
These are the five things I found in three years of research that cause talented

476
00:30:41.441 --> 00:30:42.790
people to derail.

477
00:30:44.050 --> 00:30:48.170
<v 1>Great.
So we're going to pause here for questions.
I know,
uh,</v>

478
00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:51.670
we'll take some questions and I'll let you speak in the mic.

479
00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:53.650
Anyone have a question?
Top of mind.

480
00:30:56.140 --> 00:31:01.060
Hi and thanks for being here.
Of the five common reasons for derailment.

481
00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:02.350
What's the distribution like?

482
00:31:02.351 --> 00:31:05.050
Which ones are more common than others in the research that you see?

483
00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:05.983
<v 2>Very good.</v>

484
00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:11.830
Two of them affect more people then the other three and they are version 1.0 I

485
00:31:15.621 --> 00:31:19.190
think that with the rate of change that we live in,
if you don't,
if you know,

486
00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:23.270
you shut your eyes,
you know,
things change.
It's staying curious.

487
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:28.640
Um,
learning agility,
learning agility is,
you know,
are you open minded,

488
00:31:28.670 --> 00:31:31.970
are you reflective after you do something to reflect on how it went?

489
00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:35.990
Do you seek feedback constantly on a regular basis?

490
00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:40.430
Do you have those discovery skills to go out in the market and watch your

491
00:31:40.431 --> 00:31:45.050
customer and,
and,
and talk to your suppliers?
Look at the competition.

492
00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:46.520
So that is the,

493
00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:51.820
that is the probably the single biggest along with interpersonal issues that are

494
00:31:52.791 --> 00:31:57.620
usually driven by lack of empathy and lack of understanding the other person's

495
00:31:57.621 --> 00:32:01.640
perspective.
Now here's a caveat on my website.

496
00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.970
I built this website and I put my derailment assessment on it.

497
00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:08.690
So if you go on Carter,
cast.com I think it's back slash resources.

498
00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:12.740
You'll see this assessment you can take to see which of these five you might

499
00:32:12.741 --> 00:32:17.210
suffer from.
The number one self reported reason.

500
00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:19.550
Everyone is saying they feel like a wheel.
Not everyone.

501
00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:22.550
There's a lot of people saying they feel like a whirling dervish.

502
00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:26.420
So my theory on that is
with,

503
00:32:26.421 --> 00:32:31.421
so we're being delusional with tweets and texts and emails and social media

504
00:32:33.861 --> 00:32:37.730
messages.
I think everyone just feels like a whirling dervish right now period.

505
00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:43.150
So that is the self reported but the research and it was a really rigorous,

506
00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:48.410
it's those two I mentioned.
Oh hold on one.
Let me get,

507
00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.380
let me get you the mic.
Okay.

508
00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:50.703
<v 0>Okay,</v>

509
00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:53.590
<v 2>thanks.
Adequate followup on that,</v>

510
00:32:53.591 --> 00:32:58.591
which is how much of them are unique to a particular archetype versus a mix of a

511
00:32:59.141 --> 00:33:02.260
few?
Cause I see bits of myself and a few of them.
Yes.

512
00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:03.370
That's a really good question.

513
00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:07.450
A lot of times different stages of your career,

514
00:33:07.451 --> 00:33:09.340
your flirt with different ones of these.

515
00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:15.150
So I was told I was a one trick pony when I didn't understand pepsico very well

516
00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:20.440
and they said,
you know,
you're,
you're not strategic,

517
00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:21.910
you're good at getting things done,

518
00:33:21.911 --> 00:33:24.670
but you don't really have a good sense of strategy.

519
00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:28.990
Well I was 30 you know,
I was going to learn that over time.

520
00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:33.670
So I that the captain fantastic is a tendency I have with,

521
00:33:33.671 --> 00:33:35.290
with bosses that are micromanage me.

522
00:33:35.291 --> 00:33:38.770
That's very bad that I learned about mid career.

523
00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:44.280
I'm worried now about version 1.0 because of the rate of change in technology

524
00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:47.920
and I worry about whirling dervish now because I'm overextended.

525
00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:53.350
So I think it's natural to feel like there's bits and pieces of these in the

526
00:33:53.351 --> 00:33:57.700
book I actually have,
I spend probably this is more like a field guide.

527
00:33:57.730 --> 00:34:01.510
I lay out the derailer and then I spend a lot of time on remedies.

528
00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:06.610
So you'll find different pieces of derailleurs that affect you and you'll find

529
00:34:06.611 --> 00:34:08.380
certain remedies that might help you.

530
00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:12.460
But I think it's natural to feel like you have pieces of different ones of them.

531
00:34:13.210 --> 00:34:15.640
Especially if you look over time,

532
00:34:15.641 --> 00:34:18.820
you might've felt like earlier on you you're a solo flyer,

533
00:34:18.821 --> 00:34:22.590
but then you became a good manager and then another one old kind of bother you.

534
00:34:22.890 --> 00:34:24.460
It will at a later time in your career.

535
00:34:28.830 --> 00:34:29.663
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

536
00:34:30.910 --> 00:34:32.410
<v 2>This might be jumping ahead a little bit,</v>

537
00:34:32.411 --> 00:34:36.310
but I'm wondering if how many of the successful people that you talked to had

538
00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:40.320
derailed?
Like is that a common thing that people end up being successful?

539
00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:43.900
I'm glad you asked that.
How many of these successful people derail?

540
00:34:43.901 --> 00:34:45.010
So here's what's interesting.

541
00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:47.980
We get all the speakers coming to Kellogg and I'm sure you get all these

542
00:34:47.981 --> 00:34:51.610
speakers and they tell these up into the right stories,
you know,

543
00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:52.960
and it's just horse shit.

544
00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:57.820
Like people run into career trouble all the time.

545
00:34:58.750 --> 00:35:03.610
And so my whole intent of writing this book,
I mean I'm a VC and a teacher,
this,

546
00:35:03.730 --> 00:35:07.230
this is just the labor of love is I just feel like these conversations aren't

547
00:35:07.231 --> 00:35:09.160
being had enough inside of companies.

548
00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:12.880
The boss should be sitting down with a subordinate and they should be working

549
00:35:12.881 --> 00:35:17.881
together on a development plan that pinpoint some of these areas and unlock

550
00:35:18.071 --> 00:35:21.340
someone's potential by addressing them.
Just doesn't.

551
00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:23.260
It just isn't happening enough.

552
00:35:23.890 --> 00:35:27.760
Talented people run into this stuff all the time.
This is,

553
00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:31.090
this is nothing to be ashamed of.
Having one of these,
you know,

554
00:35:31.091 --> 00:35:32.410
it's like we're human.

555
00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:36.790
We're going to have some weaknesses and some vulnerabilities.
The point is,

556
00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.880
and I'll point out this in the next section,

557
00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:43.950
people that do well are on top of their own shit.

558
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:46.470
They see their own derailment areas.

559
00:35:46.471 --> 00:35:50.910
They see their own vulnerabilities and they either work around them or they find

560
00:35:50.911 --> 00:35:54.000
someone who complements them,
who can help them in area that they're weak.

561
00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:55.440
So don't,
you know,

562
00:35:55.441 --> 00:35:59.610
don't take away by any stretch of the imagination that people that are really

563
00:35:59.611 --> 00:36:03.930
talented don't go through this.
Here's what happened.
I talked to all the people.

564
00:36:03.931 --> 00:36:06.660
I talked to a hundred people who got fired or derailed.

565
00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:11.710
80% of them recovered and those who recovered,

566
00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:13.110
not surprisingly,

567
00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:18.120
we're the ones that accepted the feedback that incorporated that this eye.

568
00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:21.630
This was on me to fix so sad.

569
00:36:21.631 --> 00:36:25.680
Some of the people that I talked to that had gone on and derailed mult like one

570
00:36:25.681 --> 00:36:28.650
guy I talked to three times in a row for the same thing

571
00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:31.163
he kept,

572
00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:36.210
he kept taking the feedback and blaming it on the organization was like this.

573
00:36:36.211 --> 00:36:40.110
My boss was like this and I just was,
my heart went out to him,

574
00:36:40.830 --> 00:36:43.680
but I was a researcher so my job wasn't to play coach.

575
00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:47.610
It was to continue asking me some questions to see what he was doing about this.

576
00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:50.580
And you know,
I don't know if he's going to have an event.

577
00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:52.020
This one particular fellow,

578
00:36:52.021 --> 00:36:56.910
at some point he was going to realize this is on me to fix versus,
you know,

579
00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:58.590
projecting it on somebody else.

580
00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:02.990
You want me to go into the next section?
The next,

581
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.940
I think you're gonna like this next section because it's the,

582
00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:09.550
it's the happy stuff.
Okay.

583
00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:11.530
So this will be a shorter section.

584
00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:16.480
So flipping it on its head and saying people that are considered to be

585
00:37:16.481 --> 00:37:21.250
superstars in their organization,
what do they look like?

586
00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:26.260
Are there any specific behavioral traits or competencies they have that make

587
00:37:26.261 --> 00:37:29.680
them do so well?
So I found out that there's a couple things.

588
00:37:29.681 --> 00:37:34.681
One is they are self aware be they understand their motive structure and then

589
00:37:37.721 --> 00:37:41.590
two they have two specific competencies that matter a lot.
Okay,

590
00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:45.340
so self aware.
What do I mean by that?

591
00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:51.370
They are closer to those who rate them in three sixties if they say on a scale

592
00:37:51.371 --> 00:37:53.770
of one to five there are four in analytical thinking,

593
00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:55.930
the chances are that people reading them say there are four.

594
00:37:55.931 --> 00:37:58.810
Two they don't say there are four nobody else's.
There are two.

595
00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:01.600
They have an accurate self conception.

596
00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:05.770
People with inaccurate self-conception I looked at hundreds of thousands of

597
00:38:05.771 --> 00:38:10.771
three sixties people with inaccurate self conceptions derailed six times more

598
00:38:11.441 --> 00:38:16.441
frequently than those who are accurate in their rating in three sixties wow.

599
00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:25.150
That is based on Korn ferry three 60 research.
Secondly,

600
00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:30.870
they put themselves in the right context because they understand their motives.

601
00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:35.890
So if I asked you what's going in this picture,

602
00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:42.300
what might you say?
Anybody,

603
00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:43.860
what's going on in this picture?

604
00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:46.813
<v 0>Research.</v>

605
00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.400
<v 2>So let's say you say,
well,</v>

606
00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:57.710
Beth and Joe are working together in a lab and they've worked together five

607
00:38:57.931 --> 00:38:59.610
years.
They have a great working relationship.

608
00:38:59.611 --> 00:39:04.020
They really enjoy working with each other.
You would show an affiliation motive.

609
00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:08.280
That's the lens you're looking at through,
let's say you looked at this picture,

610
00:39:08.281 --> 00:39:11.820
you said App Joe's mansplaning yet again,
there he goes.

611
00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:15.510
That's a power motive.
You're interpreting it in terms of the power dynamic.

612
00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:19.060
Let's say you look at it and said they're this close to solving the Zeke,

613
00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:22.770
the finding the formula for the Zika virus.
That's the achievement motive.

614
00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:28.170
So this guy named David Mcclellan from Harvard said motives or bear because

615
00:39:28.171 --> 00:39:31.230
values are,
values are easier,
values are what's important to you.

616
00:39:31.231 --> 00:39:35.040
So if I asked you what do you value,
you'd probably,
you'd be able to answer it,

617
00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:39.750
maybe give you a minute or two,
but you could probably say,
I value,
uh,

618
00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:44.210
intellectual learning.
I value my family.
Oh yeah.
But if I said,
what,

619
00:39:44.211 --> 00:39:47.940
what drives you?
What are your motives?
It's like,
Ooh,
that's subconscious.

620
00:39:47.941 --> 00:39:50.940
It's trickier.
So to try to get at motives.

621
00:39:50.941 --> 00:39:53.340
Mcclellan did this picture story exercise,

622
00:39:53.341 --> 00:39:58.341
which the hay group has created into a assessment tool where you have to

623
00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:00.870
interpret a bunch of stories,

624
00:40:01.710 --> 00:40:06.120
write down what you see and then a psychologist marks it up and tells you what

625
00:40:06.121 --> 00:40:07.650
your motive profile looks like.

626
00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:12.300
So McClellan says motives are critical because they drive us.

627
00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:17.130
So we want to be in a position that maps to our motive structure and he said

628
00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:20.340
there's an achievement drive.
We have to beat a standard.

629
00:40:20.341 --> 00:40:22.470
I bet a lot of you guys have a high achievement drive.

630
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:27.480
There is an affiliation motive to be,
have close relationships and love teamwork.

631
00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:31.830
And then there's a power motive to wield influence and enjoy status.

632
00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:36.570
So then I asked the people from the Hay group that worked with Mcclellan,

633
00:40:37.410 --> 00:40:41.160
do different positions,
have different motives,
structures,
and she said,
oh yeah.

634
00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:46.110
I said,
what does a,
what does a corporate CEO look like?
What do you guys think?

635
00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:48.810
What are they gonna look back at our achievement?
Pretty high.

636
00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:51.570
What about affiliation?

637
00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:59.770
<v 0>Power?
There you go.</v>

638
00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:02.870
<v 2>What do you think?
I said,</v>

639
00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:05.920
does an entrepreneurial CEO look the same as a corporate CEO?

640
00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:08.590
You're shaking your head.
What do you think?
An entrepreneurial,

641
00:41:08.591 --> 00:41:09.450
see it looks like on

642
00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:12.940
<v 0>hi,
good job.
Hmm.</v>

643
00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:17.460
<v 2>Absolutely right.
I said,
what does a good pm look like?
And she's just a hoe.</v>

644
00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:21.680
They're the decathletes pms.
They gotta be good at a lot of stuff.

645
00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:25.520
They've got a big achievement to land the plane.

646
00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:29.000
They've gotta be affiliation to get people that don't report to them to work

647
00:41:29.001 --> 00:41:29.834
well with them.

648
00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:33.350
They've got to be good on power because people that don't report to them got to

649
00:41:33.351 --> 00:41:35.660
cajole them into getting their jobs done too.

650
00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:39.290
They get paid a lot because they're really talented across all three of these

651
00:41:39.291 --> 00:41:42.920
motives.
So I took the test here was a little Carter

652
00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:48.110
super high in achievement drive.

653
00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:52.430
Every picture I interpreted was there accomplishing something high in

654
00:41:52.431 --> 00:41:55.400
affiliation.
So I used,
we allot,
we're doing this,

655
00:41:55.401 --> 00:41:59.240
they're doing this and very,
very low and power.

656
00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:03.530
And so the woman that that,
the psychologist that did my assessment said,

657
00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:07.430
what was it like to be a CEO of a multibillion dollar company?

658
00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:11.510
When you have such low power drive compared to typical CEOs.

659
00:42:11.511 --> 00:42:13.820
And you know what I said,
I didn't like the job.

660
00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:18.380
I was in the wrong job when I was president.

661
00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:23.780
I was back at uh,
in Brisbane,
California,

662
00:42:23.781 --> 00:42:28.040
just down the road here and working with the software developers and working

663
00:42:28.041 --> 00:42:30.530
with the,
or we're developing the product and I loved it.

664
00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:34.610
Then I got promoted to be the CEO and my job was to work with analysts.

665
00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:39.770
It was to deal with klaxons class action lawsuits,
legal issues,

666
00:42:41.330 --> 00:42:45.950
all of a sudden to influence groups of people.

667
00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:50.210
And I would have rather been back working on the product with a team.

668
00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:54.860
So people in there with the right stuff,

669
00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:57.620
they put themselves in the right work context.

670
00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:02.360
They understand their motivators and they under,

671
00:43:02.361 --> 00:43:05.570
and they're self aware about their strengths and weaknesses and vulnerabilities.

672
00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:08.390
So they put themselves in jobs that give them energy.

673
00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:14.260
And I can tell you firsthand that what I do now as a venture capitalist and a

674
00:43:15.111 --> 00:43:19.490
teacher fits my motive structure a lot better than,
see I don't get paid as much,

675
00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:21.860
but it fits my motive.
I'm much happier.

676
00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:27.370
So in the book I list these motives and I added two more after talking to Dan

677
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:32.060
Pink and doing some more research.
Dan Pink wrote drive.
He says,
Carter,

678
00:43:32.061 --> 00:43:34.400
you got to add autonomy because you know,

679
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:39.530
wanting to have discretion over your work and you gotta add purpose,
right?

680
00:43:39.531 --> 00:43:41.780
Mission driven.
Some people are just very mission driven.

681
00:43:41.781 --> 00:43:45.410
They want to work in clean tech or they want to work in education or health care

682
00:43:45.411 --> 00:43:46.244
reform.

683
00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:51.080
So in the book I take each of these five motives and here I just gave you a

684
00:43:51.081 --> 00:43:54.590
sample of two but I asked eight questions around each of these areas.

685
00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:58.010
So for example,
I'm very driven by autonomy.

686
00:43:59.270 --> 00:44:02.150
I do my best work when I have freedom to run with my ideas.

687
00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:07.880
I would rather struggle with the answer then be told it,
right?

688
00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:13.210
So if you think that you might question your motives structure in the book,

689
00:44:14.001 --> 00:44:18.830
I have eight questions and each of these five areas to really think about that

690
00:44:18.831 --> 00:44:23.750
might help you understand what's what drives you and is the position you're in

691
00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:27.830
appealing to your motive profile.
Because people with the right stuff,

692
00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:32.760
they put themselves in the right positions to succeed because they naturally

693
00:44:32.761 --> 00:44:36.690
work with,
they have energy because I'm similar to you.

694
00:44:36.691 --> 00:44:39.360
It's like achievement is important to me.
Power risen.

695
00:44:39.570 --> 00:44:42.870
But normally when you see a lot of these things,
they're just together as like,

696
00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:45.090
you know,
getting to the top and be the best.

697
00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:50.160
So achievement is you want your war,

698
00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:52.050
you want to be scored on your work,

699
00:44:52.350 --> 00:44:57.300
you want to be able to see the results in your contribution.

700
00:44:58.230 --> 00:45:02.820
Power is you want to wield influence over others and you enjoy the status.

701
00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:06.600
So if I look at power up here,
I enjoy running clubs in row.

702
00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:09.750
I've never run a damn thing in my life until I was a CEO.

703
00:45:09.751 --> 00:45:14.520
But I mean like in growing up I was never a leader like that.

704
00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:16.440
You know,
it just wasn't something I did.

705
00:45:16.441 --> 00:45:21.280
I was always like swimming or you know,
in club,
you know,

706
00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:24.360
clubs that were about sort of better self betterment.

707
00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:27.060
So they're very different.

708
00:45:27.061 --> 00:45:29.610
They feel like one might lead to the other achievement.

709
00:45:29.611 --> 00:45:30.870
A lot might lead to power,

710
00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:35.610
but the mode of itself is pure in that if you like achievement,

711
00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:39.060
it's really about you wanting to measure yourself against the standard and beat

712
00:45:39.061 --> 00:45:39.894
it.

713
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:44.640
So here's the last big thought I told you.

714
00:45:44.641 --> 00:45:49.110
There are two competencies that matter a lot.
Okay,

715
00:45:49.111 --> 00:45:53.430
look at this.
So most organizations have what?
10 competencies?
Some of AIDS,

716
00:45:53.431 --> 00:45:55.110
I'm at 12 but the average is 10

717
00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:58.830
if you're only good,

718
00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:02.310
if you're only rated in the top core tile

719
00:46:04.050 --> 00:46:08.430
and managerial effectiveness and build strong relationships,
one competency,

720
00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:13.700
the chances are 12% you're in the 90th percentile of your company and managerial

721
00:46:15.181 --> 00:46:19.200
effectiveness.
If you only have one and it's drive for results.

722
00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:22.530
If that's the only competency you have out of 10

723
00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:26.720
and that's the one you're in the top core tile,

724
00:46:26.721 --> 00:46:31.490
the chances are 14% you're in the 90th percentile in your company and managerial

725
00:46:31.491 --> 00:46:34.670
effectiveness.
But look what happens when you have the two of them.

726
00:46:36.590 --> 00:46:39.950
Build strong relationships and drives for results.

727
00:46:39.951 --> 00:46:44.390
The chances are 72 you don't have to have any of the other eight on average.

728
00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:47.780
If you have those two,
the chances are 72% that you're in the top,

729
00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:51.620
you're the 90th percentile and managerial effectiveness makes sense,
doesn't it?

730
00:46:52.850 --> 00:46:56.120
You build strong relationships.
You build bridges with other departments.

731
00:46:56.270 --> 00:47:00.470
You seek to understand before being understood,
you're empathetic,

732
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:04.890
you understand the other department's objectives and then they end up

733
00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:07.340
reciprocity.
They end up wanting to help you.

734
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:12.200
You build bridges and you drive for completion.

735
00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:14.810
If you add to those two,

736
00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:19.340
being self aware so you put yourselves in the right positions,
given your gifts,

737
00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:23.000
that's the right stuff.
That's the formula,
right?

738
00:47:23.001 --> 00:47:25.730
They're so capable.

739
00:47:25.731 --> 00:47:30.731
People derail because they don't have a good of their blind spots and skill gaps

740
00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:38.130
and people with the right stuff seek constant feedback so they can improve and

741
00:47:40.691 --> 00:47:43.620
they're more self aware so they can manage around their inner,

742
00:47:43.690 --> 00:47:47.290
their volt vulnerabilities and put themselves in the right positions given their

743
00:47:47.291 --> 00:47:48.124
strengths.

744
00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:50.890
<v 0>That's it.
That's it.</v>

745
00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:55.960
With that we can talk.
Yeah,
so all of them have to question.

746
00:47:56.060 --> 00:47:56.893
Thank you.

747
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:02.290
All right.
Questions.

748
00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:07.630
<v 2>Does that surprise you guys to see that you know,</v>

749
00:48:07.631 --> 00:48:11.140
you have all these competencies and that there's only a couple that really,

750
00:48:11.141 --> 00:48:15.160
really matter.
It made me feel better.
Like wow,

751
00:48:15.161 --> 00:48:17.230
really focused on these two areas.

752
00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:18.883
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

753
00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:27.410
<v 2>What do you think having gone through this process and written this book,</v>

754
00:48:27.411 --> 00:48:29.780
looking back at your previous career,

755
00:48:29.781 --> 00:48:33.810
you really wish you would've known and your third is in your twenties guy?

756
00:48:33.811 --> 00:48:38.750
That's a good question.
So I will,
can I write on a whiteboard?

757
00:48:38.890 --> 00:48:41.230
<v 0>Yeah,
go for it.
I can bring it over.</v>

758
00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:45.540
There we go.
Okay.

759
00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:47.470
<v 2>So this is the back of the brontosaurus.</v>

760
00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:56.360
Let's say you're at a company that's mature.
This is,

761
00:48:58.070 --> 00:49:01.720
this is size of company and this is time.
Okay?

762
00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:06.620
This is the growth stage.
This is the scale stage.

763
00:49:10.170 --> 00:49:11.790
This is a startup phase

764
00:49:13.410 --> 00:49:17.250
and this is the incubate stage.
Okay?

765
00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:21.600
This is probably like where you're getting funding.
You're starting the idea.

766
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:24.930
So you need to have a certain skill set here,
right?

767
00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:29.540
You've got to have that associational thinking.
You've gotta be,
um,

768
00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:33.600
out in the market and finding the need,
finding the job to be done,

769
00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:38.190
creating the idea.
You have to be optimistic,
you have to be resilient as hell.

770
00:49:38.191 --> 00:49:39.810
Cause everyone says no.
Do you all the time.

771
00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:43.920
You have to be a good salesperson to get people to work with you and to convince

772
00:49:43.921 --> 00:49:44.970
people to loan you money.

773
00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:48.420
Then you start up and all of a sudden you start needing to have some good

774
00:49:48.421 --> 00:49:50.970
selling skills,
some good marketing skills.

775
00:49:50.971 --> 00:49:53.730
You got to raise capital scale.

776
00:49:53.731 --> 00:49:57.030
You got to get processes and procedures in place to be able to scale.

777
00:49:57.031 --> 00:49:59.820
And you have to understand organizational design.

778
00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:05.070
You have to figure out product iteration and product extension here you get to

779
00:50:05.071 --> 00:50:07.680
understand partnerships,
business development,

780
00:50:07.770 --> 00:50:11.460
you're going into international markets.
What's the next version of the product?

781
00:50:11.461 --> 00:50:13.860
How do you keep it alive?
And then boom,

782
00:50:14.010 --> 00:50:16.710
you're talking about complex or you know,

783
00:50:16.711 --> 00:50:21.270
being effective in a complex organization.
Um,
cost management,
how to,

784
00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:23.280
how to re,
uh,

785
00:50:23.790 --> 00:50:28.220
re integrate or reinvigorate a brand.
Like I'm on board of Kellogg Company,

786
00:50:28.221 --> 00:50:31.070
the cereal company.
How do you reinvigorate that brand?

787
00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:34.850
So these stages,
here's what I wish I woulda known.

788
00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:40.340
I played here 11 years at Pepsico,

789
00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:42.980
$50 billion company and I was always butting,

790
00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:45.680
butting up against my own derailment tendencies.

791
00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:51.640
Then I went here to electronic arts when it was 600 million and now it's what,

792
00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:53.690
you know,
it's mark caps like 30 billion.

793
00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:58.820
And I felt much more natural because it was chaotic and it appealed more to my

794
00:50:58.821 --> 00:51:02.390
sort of enjoyment of life,
that speed.
Then I went down here with,

795
00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:06.650
with two guys and start a Blue Nile before it got series a funding.

796
00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:11.090
And I realized that I love this state,
the right in here.

797
00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:17.530
So one thing I wish I would've known is I should've slid down that brontosaurus

798
00:51:17.811 --> 00:51:22.811
sooner and gotten into these environments that are more for me,

799
00:51:24.350 --> 00:51:28.910
better fit my own personality profile.
This was fun.

800
00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:33.620
This was really fun.
This was torturous for me with my personality,

801
00:51:34.850 --> 00:51:39.500
just with my natural mode of structure.
So understanding not only the tech,

802
00:51:39.501 --> 00:51:43.910
not only the industry you want to play in and not only the function you want to

803
00:51:43.911 --> 00:51:48.230
play in,
but where in this,
where in the um,

804
00:51:49.790 --> 00:51:51.890
in the stage of the company do you want to play?

805
00:51:52.810 --> 00:51:55.630
<v 1>Yeah.
Well I had a question about,
uh,</v>

806
00:51:55.631 --> 00:51:59.410
so knowing that you were the CEO of Walmart and immature part and like thinking

807
00:51:59.411 --> 00:52:02.410
it wasn't for you,
when did you know that and,

808
00:52:02.411 --> 00:52:05.440
and like what was your strategy there specifically?

809
00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:09.490
<v 2>Something happened.
So I went to Walmart,
so I went to blue,
we did Blue Nile,</v>

810
00:52:09.491 --> 00:52:10.840
then I went to Walmart when it was here.

811
00:52:10.841 --> 00:52:14.800
We were 30 of US starting it and it was crazy and we made a bunch of mistakes

812
00:52:14.801 --> 00:52:16.120
and it was chaotic and it's fun.

813
00:52:16.510 --> 00:52:21.510
And then we got up into here and I was a CEO and then they wanted to move me to

814
00:52:23.801 --> 00:52:26.470
be this,
to,
to get trained under someone,

815
00:52:26.471 --> 00:52:29.320
to be the CEO for a Sam's Club.

816
00:52:30.250 --> 00:52:33.310
That was my next move and I had a good review

817
00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:36.190
and I drove home.

818
00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:40.360
I had a condo in Bentonville and lived out here and I drove back and I realized

819
00:52:40.361 --> 00:52:42.970
I don't have any energy right now.
What's going on?

820
00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:48.520
Why am I not thrilled with this big opportunity?

821
00:52:49.210 --> 00:52:51.940
And I realized that I didn't have,

822
00:52:51.941 --> 00:52:55.810
I didn't think of it in terms of motive structure like I just talked about
today.

823
00:52:56.210 --> 00:52:58.420
It something was not right for me.

824
00:52:58.570 --> 00:53:03.550
And it was because I would have been playing up in here again at Sam's club and

825
00:53:03.551 --> 00:53:04.600
I liked playing in here.

826
00:53:04.990 --> 00:53:09.160
So what I did naturally was I left the company and I went back to another early

827
00:53:09.161 --> 00:53:12.760
stage,
start up again.
So you know,
the,
and I'm not,

828
00:53:12.761 --> 00:53:16.060
I'm not saying anything about evaluative,

829
00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:17.770
about being in a mature company.

830
00:53:18.790 --> 00:53:22.090
It wasn't right for me given my personality.
That's what I'm saying.

831
00:53:22.091 --> 00:53:26.460
Not that this is,
there's many wonderful jobs up here.
I just wasn't for me.

832
00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:29.430
I think we have time for one more question

833
00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:32.583
<v 0>now.
One more.</v>

834
00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:39.690
<v 1>Um,
you talk a lot about just like personal skills and things like that,
but then,</v>

835
00:53:39.691 --> 00:53:42.440
then you talked about how your reactions were with different managers.

836
00:53:42.441 --> 00:53:46.970
So how important do you think having an effective and strong manager is in kind

837
00:53:46.971 --> 00:53:50.600
of career growth and being able to,
you know,
correct yourself as well?

838
00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:54.650
<v 2>Yeah,
I was,
I think I can tell you the guy's name was Steven Quinn,</v>

839
00:53:54.651 --> 00:53:56.360
the Canadian that say,
I mean I,

840
00:53:56.930 --> 00:54:00.410
I brought him to Walmart once I got to Walmart he became the chief marketing

841
00:54:00.411 --> 00:54:04.130
officer of Walmart cause he saw what it was such a wonderful manager.

842
00:54:04.131 --> 00:54:06.590
He saved my career so I,

843
00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:10.550
it's so important I can hardly express it.
Let's say you have a bad one though.

844
00:54:10.551 --> 00:54:13.250
Let's say you're under somebody who's ineffective.
Are there a captain,

845
00:54:13.251 --> 00:54:17.060
fantastic and they don't give,
it's really important,
you know,
people say,

846
00:54:17.061 --> 00:54:19.220
well it's important to have a mentor.
It's important to have,

847
00:54:19.250 --> 00:54:20.750
I don't think of it as one mentor.

848
00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:24.350
I think of it as you want to plug into smart people,

849
00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:27.980
different places of your organization to learn from them,

850
00:54:27.981 --> 00:54:32.900
but also to have safe haven if you need it.
I was out in a job out here.
I drove,

851
00:54:32.930 --> 00:54:37.930
I had to drive to Pleasanton every day before the bark came through and I was

852
00:54:38.481 --> 00:54:43.481
under a boss that was ineffective and I ended up finding safe haven for,

853
00:54:46.100 --> 00:54:49.520
uh,
somebody who had been,
uh,
informal mentor.
I said,

854
00:54:49.521 --> 00:54:51.590
this isn't working out and he goes,
come join my group.

855
00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:56.810
So I think what you want to do is you want to have multiple people you can count

856
00:54:56.811 --> 00:54:59.600
on,
not like one Obi wan Kenobi mentor,

857
00:55:00.260 --> 00:55:04.700
but like a bunch of people in different departments that you can say,
Hey,

858
00:55:04.701 --> 00:55:08.630
can I buy a cup of coffee and can you help me reason through this problem I'm

859
00:55:08.631 --> 00:55:11.630
facing?
And because the chances are pretty good,

860
00:55:11.810 --> 00:55:14.750
you'll find safe haven with somebody when there's a,

861
00:55:14.751 --> 00:55:18.390
or a reorg or something and you'll be able to take advantage of that,

862
00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:22.110
that relationship.
And it's actually fulfilling for them too.
It's tough,

863
00:55:22.111 --> 00:55:25.230
smart person.
Like you would want me,
you know,

864
00:55:25.550 --> 00:55:29.040
you'd seek me out for my advice.
So I don't,
I wouldn't hesitate.

865
00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:33.440
I think when people put this moniker of mentor,
it sounds so heavy.

866
00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:36.500
Like there's this obligation.
I don't think of it that way.

867
00:55:36.501 --> 00:55:41.450
I think of having like five or six different counselors that you can just go to

868
00:55:41.451 --> 00:55:42.960
now and again.
Yeah.

869
00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:46.770
<v 1>Great.
So I think we're out of time.
Thank you so much.
Thank you guys.</v>
