1
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.470
Great.
So we'll get started.
Um,

2
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.260
any Duke has devoted her life to the study of decision making under pressure

3
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.420
during your careers.
Professional Poker player.

4
00:00:17.421 --> 00:00:21.380
She won over $4 million in tournaments around the world series of poker bracelet

5
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.520
as the only woman to have won the world series of Poker Tournament of champions

6
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.610
and the BC national heads up poker championship,

7
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.860
retired from poker since 2012.

8
00:00:30.861 --> 00:00:35.480
She is now a corporate speaker and a consultant on decision strategy merging her

9
00:00:35.481 --> 00:00:39.380
poker expertise and her graduate level research in psychology at the University

10
00:00:39.381 --> 00:00:44.340
of Pennsylvania.
She has authored five books,
is a cofounder of how I decide.

11
00:00:44.341 --> 00:00:44.990
Dot Org.

12
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.950
Serves on the board of afterschool all stars and is a trustee of the Franklin

13
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.940
Institute.
She's also wanted,
uh,
televised championship in rock,
paper,
scissors.

14
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.520
Is that a high stake game of rock,
paper,
scissors?
Yeah,

15
00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.590
I think I won like $10,000.
I'd say high stakes.
Yeah,

16
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.350
Mama for and she lives outside Philadelphia.
So let's welcome her to Google.

17
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.410
Um,
so,
and you want to start with,
um,

18
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.940
what inspired you to write this book?

19
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.260
<v 2>Oh Wow.
That's a very broad question.
So I,
you know,</v>

20
00:01:19.261 --> 00:01:22.050
I used to joke,
the joke that I used to make was I,

21
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.060
for most of my professional career,

22
00:01:24.061 --> 00:01:28.230
I spent my life taking advantage of people who made decisions that weren't so

23
00:01:28.231 --> 00:01:32.280
good.
So maybe I should spend some of my life trying to help people make better

24
00:01:32.281 --> 00:01:35.610
decisions.
Um,
so that's kind of the cheeky answer,

25
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.640
but I think that what actually really inspired me to write the book was that I

26
00:01:40.861 --> 00:01:44.670
started off my life in academics.
I was,
I was at the University of Pennsylvania.

27
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.770
I was studying cognitive science,

28
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.090
which is really of course a study of the way that our brains interact with the

29
00:01:51.091 --> 00:01:55.920
environment.
How do we process information as it comes in?
Um,

30
00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.720
I was getting my phd in that,
you know,

31
00:01:57.721 --> 00:02:00.600
had a national science foundation fellowship and I was on my way to become a

32
00:02:00.601 --> 00:02:05.400
professor.
Um,
and right at the end of that journey,
I actually got sick.

33
00:02:05.401 --> 00:02:08.940
I ended up with a stomach problem that landed me in the hospital for a couple of

34
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.410
weeks and I ended up missing the job market for that year because it's seasonal.

35
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.860
So I had to take time off just to recuperate and I was going to go back out on

36
00:02:19.081 --> 00:02:22.650
the market the next year.
And I,
I ended up in that year.
That's when I took this,

37
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.070
what felt like this very big left turn into poker.
Um,

38
00:02:26.071 --> 00:02:30.930
so I started playing poker and uh,
about eight years into it,
um,

39
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.180
I got asked by a actually a retreat of options traders if I could come speak to

40
00:02:36.181 --> 00:02:40.950
them about the way that poker might inform their decision making and how they

41
00:02:40.951 --> 00:02:45.690
handle risk.
Um,
and it was this moment where I realized,
you know,
Oh gosh,

42
00:02:45.691 --> 00:02:49.770
I thought I took this really huge left turn out of academics,
but I didn't,

43
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.990
I landed in just a really amazing natural laboratory to study.

44
00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.340
How do we make decisions under conditions of uncertainty when the outcomes of

45
00:03:00.341 --> 00:03:04.900
those decisions are not very well connected to the quality of the decision

46
00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:08.380
making itself.
It's just a very noisy environment.

47
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.740
And how are you pulling the signal out and how are you learning under those

48
00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:16.480
circumstances?
And the answer is not so well really.
Um,

49
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.900
and it was this moment of kind of revelation for me as I was,

50
00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.240
as I was thinking like,
what am I going to say to this group of people?
Because I,

51
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.760
it was this kind of moment where it all came together for me where I said,

52
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:31.121
you know,

53
00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:35.200
it's really interesting because I was taught in graduate school that learning

54
00:03:35.201 --> 00:03:39.460
occurs under conditions where you have lots and lots of feedback tied closely in

55
00:03:39.461 --> 00:03:43.600
time to decisions and actions.
And as I'm going to go talk to these people,

56
00:03:43.601 --> 00:03:46.300
what I realize is poker is the ultimate.

57
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.060
Lots and lots of feedback tied closely in time.

58
00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:53.080
I mean like within 30 seconds of time to decisions and actions.

59
00:03:53.081 --> 00:03:55.870
And yet what I saw was that learning was not occurring very well.

60
00:03:55.871 --> 00:03:59.230
And so it was that moment of wanting to square those two things together.

61
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.010
And after that first talk,
I just went along,
you know,
I was like,
oh.

62
00:04:03.011 --> 00:04:05.370
And I started building this second career and,

63
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.400
and speaking to audiences about how poker is a kind of a really great platform

64
00:04:11.081 --> 00:04:14.890
and framework for kind of understanding not only what are the problems in

65
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.030
decision making,
but how can we kind of solve for them.
Um,

66
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.060
and I sort of feel like from 2002 I was just workshopping this material and that

67
00:04:24.491 --> 00:04:28.660
I was finding this incredible joy and sharing these ideas,
um,

68
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.040
with people in a way that was felt really different to me than poker.
In poker.

69
00:04:33.041 --> 00:04:36.760
I'm thinking about these ideas in a way that's very zero sum,
right?

70
00:04:36.761 --> 00:04:40.490
I'm going to win.
You're going to lose,
you're going to win.
I'm going to lose.
Um,

71
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.060
and you know,
when I started doing this in 2002,

72
00:04:43.061 --> 00:04:46.000
I started growing that business and it started to become a much bigger part of

73
00:04:46.001 --> 00:04:50.230
my life actually than the poker was in it.
It just felt in this really nice way,

74
00:04:50.231 --> 00:04:54.700
like I was adding water sort of back into the ocean.
Um,
and you know,
that's,

75
00:04:54.701 --> 00:04:56.480
this book sort of,
you know,

76
00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.100
came out of that whole journey that I took.

77
00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.210
So can we talk about what prevents people from making good decisions?
Oh,

78
00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.440
that's cause that's that.
Do we want to narrow that down?

79
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.620
What prevents people from making good decisions?

80
00:05:11.621 --> 00:05:16.240
I think it's a collision of a couple of problems.
I think that,
um,

81
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.950
the,

82
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.950
the first pieces is uncertainty and uncertainty comes from two places.

83
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.790
Uh,
it comes from hidden information.

84
00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:29.200
So this is where we can see how poker might be a really good way to look at

85
00:05:29.201 --> 00:05:33.250
decision making.
The first place it comes from is hidden information.
So in poker,

86
00:05:33.251 --> 00:05:36.370
the cards are face down.
Guess what?
In life as well,

87
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.140
there's very often a lot of information asymmetry,
right?
Um,
and,

88
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.120
and there's lots of stuff that we can't know and there's lots of things that we

89
00:05:43.121 --> 00:05:47.410
don't know.
So that's the first place that uncertainty comes from.

90
00:05:47.411 --> 00:05:51.190
But even if we did have perfect information,
say for example,
about a coin,

91
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.120
and we know that heads or tails,
it's gonna flip 50% of the time.

92
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.840
We also have the intervention of luck,
which is the other form of uncertainty.
Um,

93
00:05:59.841 --> 00:06:03.110
so even if I know everything I need to know about the coin,

94
00:06:03.111 --> 00:06:05.150
so there's no hidden information about the coin,

95
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.390
that doesn't mean I can predict whether it will flip heads or tails on the next

96
00:06:08.391 --> 00:06:11.240
try.
I can say something over 10,000 tries.

97
00:06:11.241 --> 00:06:13.460
I can tell you how it's gonna work out over time.

98
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:18.060
But most of what we're doing is actually sort of these one trial,
um,

99
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:19.281
scenarios,

100
00:06:19.281 --> 00:06:22.610
and particularly as we're trying to make decisions and learn from the outcomes

101
00:06:22.611 --> 00:06:26.840
of our decisions were not very good.
Aggravators so we're not sitting back,
well,

102
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.590
first of all,
most of the decisions we make,
we couldn't get 10,000 trials even.

103
00:06:30.591 --> 00:06:33.140
So,
um,
but even if we could,

104
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:37.010
the data's kind of coming in one at a time as we're out sort of in the field

105
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.230
making her own decisions.
And so we're at,

106
00:06:39.231 --> 00:06:41.480
we're sort of encoding everything one at a time.

107
00:06:41.481 --> 00:06:45.030
We're not sitting back and saying,
let me not making any decisions,
um,

108
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.000
until I have lots and lots of data.
And in fact,

109
00:06:47.001 --> 00:06:49.760
that would be impractical because like for example,

110
00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.960
you would never say get married to somebody.
Then,
right,

111
00:06:53.961 --> 00:06:57.830
because you'd have to get so many trials in order to know that you were sure.

112
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.950
So it's that it's not practical to do anyways.
So the first piece,

113
00:07:00.951 --> 00:07:03.170
the first problem is that there's all this uncertainty.

114
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.300
And then the second problem is that nature,

115
00:07:05.301 --> 00:07:10.301
the way that our brains are built has given us a lot of rope to hang ourselves

116
00:07:11.151 --> 00:07:15.680
with the uncertainty.
Um,
and we can sort of go back to sort of the beginning,

117
00:07:15.681 --> 00:07:19.550
which is what are the types of errors that evolution built us to make?

118
00:07:19.551 --> 00:07:22.730
Because there are a type one errors and type two errors,
a type one.

119
00:07:22.731 --> 00:07:25.970
Errors are false positives and type two errors are false negatives.
Um,

120
00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.640
and we're really,
really built for hotspot,
false positives.

121
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.640
We connect things together.
We think they're causal.

122
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:35.540
We think they go together much more often than they,
than they actually do.
Um,

123
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:40.270
so we're big at patterns.
We love things to be connected together.
Um,

124
00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:43.760
so,
and that causes a problem.
So that's sort of problem number one.

125
00:07:43.761 --> 00:07:47.300
And we can think about that in the sense of which is worth,

126
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:52.190
if you're on the Savannah and you hear wrestling,
you know,
among the reeds,

127
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.460
are you,
is it,
are you going to wait and say,
oh,

128
00:07:55.461 --> 00:07:58.610
let me try to figure out if there's actually a lion here or are you going to run

129
00:07:58.611 --> 00:08:03.380
away?
Right?
So obviously we're going to run away.
Um,
so that's number one.

130
00:08:03.381 --> 00:08:05.390
Number two is we're built for tribes.

131
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:10.040
So there was a lot of advantage for us surviving if we came together in groups

132
00:08:10.041 --> 00:08:10.910
and we had tribes.

133
00:08:10.911 --> 00:08:14.690
And so that causes a problem as well for decision making because it causes these

134
00:08:14.691 --> 00:08:18.290
problems and the way that we process information from things that are outside of

135
00:08:18.291 --> 00:08:22.730
our tribe.
So that's kind of the number two problem.
Um,

136
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:25.420
and then the number three problem is,
is really,
I,

137
00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:30.590
I talk about this a lot in the book is that we aren't really built to disconfirm

138
00:08:30.831 --> 00:08:33.500
the things that we already believe.
Um,

139
00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:37.790
we're very much built to affirm our priors.
Um,

140
00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.640
and so when you think about the uncertainty and the way that we sort of

141
00:08:40.641 --> 00:08:44.760
interpret information as it comes in,
there's so much uncertainty in,

142
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.910
in the data that we're getting,

143
00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:52.210
that it gives us the room to just process the world in a way to make us feel

144
00:08:52.281 --> 00:08:55.130
right,
um,
about the things that we already believe.

145
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.150
And when you have that collision between that,

146
00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.690
the false positive problem and then the tribal problem on top of that,

147
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:04.020
like things really fall apart.
Now your book,

148
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:06.750
you were talking about this beliefs people have about showing the right

149
00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:10.140
information to people and somehow it will get them to see things correctly.

150
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:12.410
Can you talk more about that too?
Sorry.
I,

151
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:15.000
so I think that this is part of the problem is that,
um,

152
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:20.100
we have these ways that we process information.
Um,
so,
uh,

153
00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.160
an example that I talk about it and my book is something called motivated

154
00:09:23.161 --> 00:09:27.330
reasoning.
So I think you've all probably heard about confirmation bias.

155
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:31.590
So motivated reasoning is a larger problem than confirmation bias.

156
00:09:31.591 --> 00:09:35.220
So in confirmation bias,
we have some sort of prior belief,
um,

157
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:40.140
and we'll notice stuff that confirms the belief and we just kind of won't notice

158
00:09:40.141 --> 00:09:43.920
things that disconfirm the belief motivated reasoning is let's think about this

159
00:09:43.921 --> 00:09:47.070
as an umbrella problem of which confirmation bias as part,

160
00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:51.690
which is that we actually are motivated to confirm the beliefs we have and that

161
00:09:51.691 --> 00:09:56.370
drives our information processing.
So that means that not only will we,

162
00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:58.300
um,
process him from,
well,

163
00:09:58.301 --> 00:10:01.950
we sort of noticed stuff that confirms us and not notice things that disconfirm

164
00:10:01.951 --> 00:10:06.480
us,
but also when confronted with information that disconfirms us,

165
00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:08.580
we work very,
very hard to discredit it.

166
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:11.430
And when confronted with information that confirms us,

167
00:10:11.431 --> 00:10:13.950
we actually don't put any effort into the [inaudible] at all.

168
00:10:13.951 --> 00:10:17.340
So we don't really vet it very hard.
So I,

169
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:19.170
and you guys can probably feel that way,
right?

170
00:10:19.171 --> 00:10:23.520
When I read a article that say politically agrees with me,
I'm like,
wow,

171
00:10:23.521 --> 00:10:25.750
that's a really smart article.
Um,

172
00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:30.690
and when it disagrees with me political,
I am like that,
you know,

173
00:10:30.691 --> 00:10:33.410
they're looking at this study and the n is too small and the,

174
00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.420
they weren't looking at this data and they were asking the wrong questions and

175
00:10:36.421 --> 00:10:40.110
the person isn't reliable anyway and they forgot all this other stuff and

176
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.420
they're totally biased.
Um,
and you know,

177
00:10:42.421 --> 00:10:44.910
it's weird cause I just don't go through that process with the things that agree

178
00:10:44.911 --> 00:10:49.140
with me.
Strange.
Um,
okay.
So,
so not only that,

179
00:10:49.141 --> 00:10:52.320
then we have this other issue,
which is that when we're in a tribe,

180
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:57.210
part of the part of what a tribe gives you is,
um,
kind of fourth.

181
00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:59.970
It gives you a sense of belongingness,
a sense of distinctiveness,
right?

182
00:10:59.971 --> 00:11:01.200
So you belong to a tribe,

183
00:11:01.201 --> 00:11:04.650
you're distinct from other tribes in some way where you process that as being

184
00:11:04.651 --> 00:11:08.650
superior.
It,
um,
gives you,
uh,
uh,

185
00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:11.850
the idea of sort of what's moral and what's not is also including the tribe.

186
00:11:11.851 --> 00:11:14.370
But then it also gives you something really important for this talk today,

187
00:11:14.371 --> 00:11:16.410
which is called epistemic closure.

188
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:21.710
Meaning that the tribe is telling you what knowledge is true and trustworthy and

189
00:11:21.991 --> 00:11:26.760
what is not.
So I think that a lot of times what we sort of think,

190
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:28.350
and this is where we understand this,

191
00:11:28.351 --> 00:11:31.440
the motivated reasoning with the collision of the tribal problem,

192
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:35.400
well we sort of think is,
oh,
if other people just had the information,

193
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.480
we'd all be fine.
Cause then we'd all sort of believe the same things,
right?

194
00:11:39.481 --> 00:11:42.990
So if we were all working with the exact same information,
we'd all be good.

195
00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:48.420
But that's assuming that we live in something that we're all living in epistemic

196
00:11:48.421 --> 00:11:53.160
bubbles versus echo chambers.
So let me just explain what the differences.
Um,

197
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:55.750
an epistemic bubble is.
You have,

198
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.680
you have information and you don't have other information period.

199
00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:03.670
So if you're in an epistemic bubble where you just haven't been,

200
00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.380
you just haven't gotten the information,

201
00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:07.060
then if you get exposed to the information,

202
00:12:07.061 --> 00:12:10.630
you incorporate it and you're all good.
But epistemic bubbles are pretty rare.

203
00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:14.140
What we mostly live in this echo chamber.
So echo chambers are,

204
00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:17.140
it doesn't matter whether we have the information or not people outside the

205
00:12:17.141 --> 00:12:20.920
group or not trusted sources.
So if you get information that disagrees with you,

206
00:12:20.921 --> 00:12:24.690
that's coming from someone outside the group,
it's not trusted anyway.

207
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:28.080
And you can see how you can use that in order to accomplish the goals of

208
00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:29.170
motivated reasoning.

209
00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:33.580
So when you're now confronted with information that disagrees with you,
um,

210
00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:34.810
the way that you actually,

211
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:38.920
one of the ways you discredit it is to talk about the trustworthiness of the

212
00:12:38.921 --> 00:12:43.740
source.
So,
you know,
what we want to be really careful about is,
um,

213
00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:48.730
we want to try to apply as we're trying to imagine,

214
00:12:48.731 --> 00:12:50.080
and I talk about this in the book,

215
00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:52.750
is we're trying to sort of vet information that comes in.

216
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:56.110
We want to apply a particular norm called universalism,

217
00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:59.770
which is separating the person who's delivering the news from whether the news

218
00:12:59.771 --> 00:13:01.990
itself is correct or not.

219
00:13:01.991 --> 00:13:06.400
So the way I put it in the book is it doesn't really matter whether it's,
um,

220
00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:07.001
you know,

221
00:13:07.001 --> 00:13:12.001
Copernicus or Mussolini or your mom who tells you that the earth is round.

222
00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:19.150
The,
the fact of the roundness of the earth is independent of those sources.

223
00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:21.250
So I,
you know,

224
00:13:21.251 --> 00:13:25.210
in order to actually be good universalists it's usually pretty good as you're

225
00:13:25.211 --> 00:13:29.590
sort of having these reactions to information to try to imagine it absence of

226
00:13:29.591 --> 00:13:33.310
the source or to try to imagine it being delivered from a source that you

227
00:13:33.311 --> 00:13:34.420
actually trust.
And,

228
00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:37.330
and that actually helps you to vet the information independently of the source,

229
00:13:37.331 --> 00:13:39.100
which we're really,
really,
really bad at.

230
00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:43.110
And it's part of this problem of echo chambers.
So,
um,

231
00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.750
you were talking about systems of how we can overcome that and looking at

232
00:13:46.751 --> 00:13:51.580
decisions in terms of bets.
Can you talk?
Sure.
Yeah.
So,

233
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:54.750
you know,
the premise of the book is called thinking in bets and,

234
00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:59.800
and the premise is that if we were more explicit in imagining,
uh,

235
00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:04.330
or in,
in actually just making clear that every decision that we make as a bet,

236
00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:08.230
um,
that we would actually better or be better off and it would create a lot more

237
00:14:08.231 --> 00:14:11.440
open mindedness.
Um,
and why is it,
well,
first of all,

238
00:14:11.441 --> 00:14:14.660
let me try to convince you guys that every decision is a bet.

239
00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:19.970
So that's the first step.
So I actually,
I'll tell a story that I tell in here,
um,

240
00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:24.160
which is kind of a fun story I think.
So there was a guy named,
uh,
John Hennigan,

241
00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:29.410
uh,
really,
really,
really great poker player,
known to have a lot of gamble.

242
00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:33.880
And in the 90s when he was in his twenties,
he was really,

243
00:14:33.881 --> 00:14:36.290
if you were to think about sort of what is a,

244
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.810
if you imagine the stereotype of a poker player in,

245
00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:45.250
in 1995,
like John Hennigan would be the guy like he was,
you know,

246
00:14:45.251 --> 00:14:47.950
he never saw the sun.
He was only playing at night.

247
00:14:47.951 --> 00:14:50.160
He was like a total accident junkie.
Like when,

248
00:14:50.161 --> 00:14:53.570
when he was finished at the poker table,
he doesn't want it to gamble more.

249
00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:57.740
Like he was really,
um,
he was very good,
but he really liked a lot of action.

250
00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:01.610
So he was sitting at a poker table one day and,
um,
uh,

251
00:15:01.611 --> 00:15:04.790
discussion broke out out about state capitals and people were like quizzing each

252
00:15:04.791 --> 00:15:08.210
other on state capitals.
So demoine Moines comes up,
um,

253
00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.420
and John Hennigan actually announces at the table is they're discussing demoine

254
00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:14.810
oh,
I could totally live in Des Moines.
And,
you know,
De Moines,

255
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:17.570
obviously reputation is kind of sleepy.

256
00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:21.800
Maybe if you were to think about sort of,
what's the antithesis of Las Vegas,

257
00:15:21.801 --> 00:15:25.240
maybe you would think of de Moines as an example.
Um,
so the,

258
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:28.040
the players at the table were like,
oh,
come on.

259
00:15:28.041 --> 00:15:30.650
Like there's no way you could live in de Moines.
Um,

260
00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:34.850
but Hennigan actually at that time in his life,
we sort of thinking like,
ah,

261
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:36.560
you know,
I never see the sun.

262
00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:40.250
And so maybe it will be really nice to go and sort of like detox from Vegas a

263
00:15:40.251 --> 00:15:42.980
little bit.
Um,
and then he also had another thing in mind,

264
00:15:42.981 --> 00:15:45.500
which is that poker players gamble on golf a lot and he thought,
well,

265
00:15:45.501 --> 00:15:47.890
then I could actually really spend some time on golf,
uh,

266
00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:51.770
without the distraction of the actual poker.
So they negotiate a bat.

267
00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:54.570
So at the table they negotiate a bet that,
um,

268
00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:57.200
John Hennigan's going to move to Las Vegas for 30 days.

269
00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:00.700
I mean to des Moines rather for 30 days.
Um,

270
00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:03.170
they add a little bit of a diabolical condition,

271
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:06.950
which is the hotel that is on is only one street and there's only one restaurant

272
00:16:06.951 --> 00:16:09.490
on the street and there's like no bars,
there's no nightlife,

273
00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:10.340
there's nothing he can,

274
00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:13.370
he's confined to the one street when he moves there for the 30 days,

275
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:16.130
except there's a specific golf course,

276
00:16:16.131 --> 00:16:19.300
he's allowed to go to the practice golf during the day.
Um,

277
00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:23.630
so they settle on 30 days and the bet is set for $30,000.

278
00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:28.040
So if he can stay in Las Vegas for 30 days,
he wins $30,000.

279
00:16:28.041 --> 00:16:31.900
If he can't stay there and he,
and he has to come back from des Moines,
um,

280
00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.860
then he's going to lose $30,000.

281
00:16:33.861 --> 00:16:38.110
So literally the next day he moves to des Moines.
So I,

282
00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.900
two days later he calls up the group and he says,
Hey,

283
00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:46.490
I'm in demoine.
I've obviously like I've completely up and move to des Moines.

284
00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:50.660
Clearly I'm good to go.
I'm going to stay here.
So if you'd like to settle,

285
00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:52.653
um,

286
00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:56.270
you guys can pay me $15,000 and I'll come home and I'll save you the misery of

287
00:16:56.271 --> 00:16:59.670
losing the whole 30.
Yeah.

288
00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:03.860
That was the group's reaction.
So they were like,
no,
we're good.
John.

289
00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.420
Why don't you,
why don't you stay there?
So a week later,

290
00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:11.300
John Hennigan had moved back from des Moines.
He was,

291
00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:15.170
he was living in Las Vegas and he had paid the group $15,000 for the privilege.

292
00:17:15.171 --> 00:17:18.620
So,
um,
so I tell this story because it sounds like,
oh my gosh,

293
00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:22.670
these crazy poker players making this bet on where John was gonna move.

294
00:17:22.671 --> 00:17:24.380
But if you think about it,

295
00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:28.400
it's really no different than any decision that you've ever made.
I mean,

296
00:17:28.401 --> 00:17:31.610
your decision to come and work at Google,
right?
You have other opportunities.

297
00:17:31.611 --> 00:17:35.210
You're thinking about what John has to think about.
Am I gonna like Des Moines?

298
00:17:35.211 --> 00:17:38.270
He doesn't know because he hasn't lived there before.
Right?

299
00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:40.970
The money that I'm going to make,
if I win this bet,

300
00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.750
is it going to be better than the money that I'm going to make if I stay in Las

301
00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:46.160
Vegas and if I'm actually taking less money?

302
00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.800
Is that okay because I'm creating different types of opportunities for myself,

303
00:17:49.801 --> 00:17:53.580
like I'm going to feel like I live a healthier life for that month and that

304
00:17:53.581 --> 00:17:57.450
that's worth making less money or I'm going to work on my golf game and that's

305
00:17:57.451 --> 00:17:58.320
going to have payoffs.

306
00:17:58.321 --> 00:18:02.040
Which would be sort of the same as I'm thinking about taking a job in des Moines

307
00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:05.820
and I have to think about how is the morning going to compare to the place that

308
00:18:05.821 --> 00:18:07.980
I live now?
I don't know.
I've never lived there.

309
00:18:07.981 --> 00:18:11.580
Am I going to like it versus any other place that I might possibly move?

310
00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:15.990
Is the salary good enough for me to feel like I'm willing to take that risk in

311
00:18:15.991 --> 00:18:19.020
terms of going and moving there?
What are the opportunities for advancement?

312
00:18:19.021 --> 00:18:22.860
What other kinds of money that you know,
could I make in the future?
Um,

313
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:27.630
and when you choose to move to des Moines or relocate or take the job at Google,

314
00:18:27.631 --> 00:18:31.380
you're obviously foregoing all other possibilities available to you can only

315
00:18:31.381 --> 00:18:35.450
make the one decision,
which was true for John Hennigan as well.
Um,

316
00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:40.490
so basically Hennigan had a certain set of belief about whether or not he would

317
00:18:40.681 --> 00:18:43.170
like to Moines whether or not it would be worth it to him.

318
00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:46.620
And when he made the choice,
he was foregoing all of their choices,

319
00:18:46.621 --> 00:18:49.290
including staying in Las Vegas and staying with the status quo.

320
00:18:49.291 --> 00:18:53.630
We're moving any other place where he might maybe detox or,
or go,
you know,

321
00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:57.240
detox from the nightlife for go and,
um,
you know,
uh,

322
00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.400
practices golf or whatever it might be.

323
00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:03.210
And there was a whole set of possible futures that could occur from that.

324
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:07.250
One where he stayed in Des Moines for 30 days and left it one where he loved

325
00:19:07.251 --> 00:19:08.970
annoying so much.
He never moved back.

326
00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.760
One where he met the love of his life in Des Moines.
You know,

327
00:19:11.761 --> 00:19:16.050
one where he calls up after two days and says,
Hey,
I want to settle.

328
00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.450
And the thing is that you don't know,
you're making,

329
00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:22.140
you're making an estimation of what the probability of each of those futures

330
00:19:22.141 --> 00:19:24.660
might be.
And you're deciding that whatever you have to invest in,

331
00:19:24.661 --> 00:19:28.230
it doesn't have to be money.
It can be your health,
your happiness,
your time,

332
00:19:28.231 --> 00:19:32.040
whatever it might be.
Usually it's all of the above.
Whatever you're investing in,

333
00:19:32.041 --> 00:19:34.530
the decision that you,
you actually go with that,

334
00:19:34.531 --> 00:19:37.830
that's gonna hurdle you to the best set of possible futures is compared to any

335
00:19:37.831 --> 00:19:39.750
other decision that you might make.

336
00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:42.600
So the poker players really just make that explicit.

337
00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:45.030
And that's really what you're doing when,

338
00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:49.620
when you're betting is you're making it explicit that a decision is a bet

339
00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:54.710
informed by your beliefs on a set of possible futures that you might be hurdling

340
00:19:55.861 --> 00:19:59.340
yourself too.
So once we kind of understand that frame,

341
00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:03.480
I think that it actually can help us overcome some of these problems that we

342
00:20:03.481 --> 00:20:07.380
have with decision making.
And I'll,
I'll show you a really simple example.

343
00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:12.630
So here's something that's been in the news a lot lately because I hear it every

344
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:17.220
single day on the news,
the Democrats are going to take the house in the fall.
So,

345
00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:21.780
okay,
so let's say that you said to me,
I,

346
00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:23.820
the Democrats are going to win the house in the fall.

347
00:20:23.821 --> 00:20:25.950
And let's say that my response was,
do you want to bet on that?

348
00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:29.580
So think for yourselves,
what does that do to you?

349
00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:35.460
It causes you to retreat from a place of certainty into a place of probabilistic

350
00:20:35.461 --> 00:20:38.880
thinking,
right?
Because now what you start to think is,
okay,
well wait,

351
00:20:38.881 --> 00:20:42.300
why do I think that?
Oh,
there's a lot of time between now and November.

352
00:20:42.301 --> 00:20:44.220
There's a lot of things that could happen,
right?

353
00:20:44.221 --> 00:20:48.790
Like Trump could solve North Korea.
I don't know.
That might change things,
right?

354
00:20:48.791 --> 00:20:51.130
We don't know.
Um,
you know,

355
00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.500
there's all sorts of other things that might happen with Trump.

356
00:20:53.501 --> 00:20:56.080
Trump is somewhat unpredictable.
Um,

357
00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:58.460
there are things that could happen with the Democrats.
There's,
you know,

358
00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:03.400
I mean the number of things that can intervene on the luck side between now and

359
00:21:03.401 --> 00:21:06.640
six months from now is pretty large.
Right?
And so,

360
00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:10.240
so you'll start to think about that it brings is bubbles that uncertainty up to

361
00:21:10.241 --> 00:21:12.610
the four and then you also start to think like,
what,
well,

362
00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:15.300
have I been reading opinions that disagree with that?
Like what,

363
00:21:15.301 --> 00:21:19.930
what is the person who's challenging me to the bet know or think that I haven't

364
00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:21.640
thought of or that I don't know?

365
00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:25.930
I have to start thinking about why might I be wrong here before I'm willing to

366
00:21:25.931 --> 00:21:28.570
actually put that kind of skin into the game.
Right?

367
00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:31.600
And so essentially what this element of,

368
00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:35.500
let me think about my decisions explicitly is as bets does,

369
00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:40.530
is it forces you into more probabilistic thinking into more the recognize the

370
00:21:40.541 --> 00:21:45.541
recognizing of these two forms of uncertainty that I don't ever have perfect

371
00:21:45.761 --> 00:21:47.980
information for pretty much anything,
right?

372
00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:52.240
We just don't and that the future is always uncertain that no matter how well I

373
00:21:52.241 --> 00:21:54.670
think about the future,
how much I predict the future,

374
00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:59.820
even if the only bad outcome can occur 1% of the time it can still happen.

375
00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:04.090
So I need to think about that as a sort of announcing these things with

376
00:22:04.091 --> 00:22:04.870
certainty.

377
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:08.960
Once you start to bubble up the uncertainty in any decision that you make a

378
00:22:08.961 --> 00:22:13.961
causes you to be much more open minded because now what happens is that you're

379
00:22:14.771 --> 00:22:15.880
thinking about,
well,

380
00:22:15.881 --> 00:22:20.881
if I can only think about if my beliefs are probabilistic and my predictions

381
00:22:21.041 --> 00:22:25.630
about the future of probabilistic than I need to be information hungry because

382
00:22:25.631 --> 00:22:29.770
what I need to do is start refining my beliefs and refining my predictions

383
00:22:29.771 --> 00:22:32.230
because I actually have to bet on these things.

384
00:22:32.231 --> 00:22:36.050
But things like my time and things like my money and things like my health and,

385
00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:38.410
and these limited resources that I have.

386
00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:41.710
And if I can only make one decision at a time,
I better.

387
00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.900
And I'm thinking about this probabilistically,

388
00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:47.290
I better start really working to try to refine all of this stuff.

389
00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:49.120
And how am I going to do that?
Well,

390
00:22:49.121 --> 00:22:53.170
it's going to cause me to be open minded in particular to why I'm wrong.

391
00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:58.120
Openminded to opinions and beliefs that disagree with me because I already know

392
00:22:58.121 --> 00:23:01.060
why I'm right.
That's how I got to a place of certainty in the first place.

393
00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:04.800
So once I start backing off of that,
I've got to start thinking about,
you know,

394
00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:07.870
again,
what does the other person know that I don't know.
Um,

395
00:23:07.871 --> 00:23:11.560
and I think that that's why it's such a good frame for trying to solve for some

396
00:23:11.561 --> 00:23:14.770
of these problems.
So you make the bed and it doesn't work out for you.

397
00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:18.880
Like what should your next steps be on hell?
They analyze what happened.

398
00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:21.970
So you make the vet and it doesn't work out for you.
Right.

399
00:23:21.971 --> 00:23:26.110
And so what should your next steps be?
So that's a very good question.
Um,

400
00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:29.260
so it's actually,
it's actually,
uh,

401
00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:34.180
one of the big problems is that once you have a result,

402
00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:39.340
it really distorts your ability to go back in and analyze the decision process.

403
00:23:39.341 --> 00:23:40.870
It's a problem called resulting.

404
00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:44.890
So another story from the book that I'll give to sort of illustrate this problem

405
00:23:44.891 --> 00:23:48.470
and we can talk about solutions for this is,
so do you guys remember,

406
00:23:48.471 --> 00:23:52.790
I'm the 2015 Superbowl sea hawks versus patriots?

407
00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:58.550
Yeah.
So you're in the right area to remember that,
right?
So I mean,
so,
okay,

408
00:23:58.551 --> 00:24:02.630
so it's the last play of the Superbowl.
Uh,
the Seahawks around the one yard line,

409
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:06.140
26 seconds left.
Uh,
it's second down.

410
00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:09.590
They have one time out in there,
down by four.

411
00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:15.320
So this is obviously a really important decision that's going on here because if

412
00:24:15.321 --> 00:24:16.154
they score,

413
00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:19.160
the Patriots are unlikely to have enough time to be able to march back down the

414
00:24:19.161 --> 00:24:23.540
field and score again.
So,
uh,
if they can get a touchdown here,

415
00:24:23.541 --> 00:24:25.630
this probably even be the game winner.
Um,

416
00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:28.490
which would be a really big deal because the patriots like never lose a

417
00:24:28.491 --> 00:24:32.750
Superbowl until this year.
And I'm from Philly,
but we'll just say,

418
00:24:32.751 --> 00:24:36.260
and I was pretty excited about that.
So,
um,
okay.

419
00:24:36.261 --> 00:24:38.400
So what does Pete Carroll do here?
Um,

420
00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:42.440
he's got a running back on his team named Marshawn Lynch.
Amazing.

421
00:24:42.441 --> 00:24:43.430
Short yardage 20 back.

422
00:24:43.431 --> 00:24:46.490
Everybody's expecting him to hand it off to Marshawn Lynch and instead he calls

423
00:24:46.491 --> 00:24:51.491
past play a Russell Wilson passes the ball and the ball is intercepted pretty

424
00:24:51.681 --> 00:24:56.570
famously and boom,
done.
Malcolm Butler intercepts the ball.
The game is over.

425
00:24:56.930 --> 00:25:01.700
Um,
the in game calling from Chris Collingsworth is,
is pretty brutal,

426
00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:06.750
um,
on this decision.
Uh,
you know,
Pete Carroll Day,
I can't even believe this call,

427
00:25:06.751 --> 00:25:08.480
this such a horrible call.
Um,

428
00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:12.140
and the next day I have to say that most of the pundits did not disagree.
Um,

429
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:15.290
there seem to be an argument among the major outlets,
um,

430
00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:18.360
about whether it was the worst call in Superbowl history,
uh,

431
00:25:18.361 --> 00:25:19.191
which was most of them.

432
00:25:19.191 --> 00:25:22.560
But USA Today actually said it was the worst call and football history period.

433
00:25:22.561 --> 00:25:25.310
So that seems to be where the disagreement way.
Um,

434
00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:30.650
so this is a really good example of resulting,
so we know what the result was.

435
00:25:30.651 --> 00:25:31.850
Horrible,
right?
I mean,

436
00:25:31.851 --> 00:25:34.190
the result was one of the worst results in Superbowl history.

437
00:25:34.191 --> 00:25:35.390
We can agree with on that,

438
00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:39.470
but that does not mean that it was one of the worst decisions in Superbowl

439
00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:41.960
history.
And I think to just declare that that,
uh,

440
00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.840
Pete Carol hadn't put any thought into it.
I mean,
this is Pete Carroll.

441
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:48.500
He's in the Superbowl for a reason.
Um,
you know,

442
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:50.180
I thought it was pretty spectacular.

443
00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:53.960
So like I'll just ask you guys to do the thought experiment so we can see what

444
00:25:53.961 --> 00:25:57.080
the problem is.
What do you do once you have the result?
Um,

445
00:25:57.110 --> 00:26:02.110
imagine the Pete Carroll passes that ball and the ball is caught for a touchdown

446
00:26:02.211 --> 00:26:06.170
in the end zone.
Just take a moment to think about that.
Now.

447
00:26:06.171 --> 00:26:09.080
How does that decision feel now?
Brilliant.

448
00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:14.780
But how it turns out on that one outcome shouldn't actually affect the way that

449
00:26:14.781 --> 00:26:18.470
we think about the decision,
right?
I mean,
that's like saying,

450
00:26:18.471 --> 00:26:22.250
if I flip a coin and you call heads and it lands heads that that was a brilliant

451
00:26:22.251 --> 00:26:25.700
decision,
but if it lands tails,
that was a really dumb decision.

452
00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:30.950
One outcome tells us nothing.
So,
so I,
but you can feel it.

453
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:32.120
You can feel that like the,

454
00:26:32.121 --> 00:26:36.890
the result acts like a gravity well and you can't climb out of it to look at

455
00:26:36.891 --> 00:26:38.930
whether the decision process was good or not.

456
00:26:38.931 --> 00:26:43.931
It's really hard now just I just to not leave you with a cliffhanger.

457
00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:44.971
This is,
you know,

458
00:26:44.971 --> 00:26:49.971
the probability of an interception and that spot depends on how many seasons you

459
00:26:50.011 --> 00:26:54.240
aggregate across,
but it's probably somewhere hovering around one or 2%,

460
00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:56.603
right?

461
00:26:56.730 --> 00:27:01.440
So here they declared this like the worst decision ever and like of 1% or hit

462
00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:02.303
basically.

463
00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:06.750
So I don't think that should really say very much about whether the quality of

464
00:27:06.751 --> 00:27:08.910
that decision was any good.
Also,
by the way,

465
00:27:08.911 --> 00:27:11.430
for anybody under who understands the options theory,

466
00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:14.850
remember they only had one time out.
So,
uh,

467
00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:17.010
if a very usual event,

468
00:27:17.011 --> 00:27:20.340
I think it's about 40% of the time that the ball just get isn't complete there.

469
00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:24.960
What happens?
The ball stops and guess what?
They have time for two running place.

470
00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.990
So if they hand the ball off to Marshawn Lynch,

471
00:27:27.991 --> 00:27:30.480
they're going to run so much time out that they're only gonna be able to get two

472
00:27:30.481 --> 00:27:33.560
plays off even with being able to call the timeout.
Um,

473
00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:35.790
so they're only going to get to two plays.

474
00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:38.940
If they pass the ball and it's dropped,
they actually get three plays,

475
00:27:38.941 --> 00:27:41.820
including those two running plays that everybody wanted them to run in the first

476
00:27:41.821 --> 00:27:44.670
place.
So it's a somewhat free option.
It costs you about,
you know,

477
00:27:44.671 --> 00:27:48.420
this intersection rate of about 1% for a more detailed analysis.

478
00:27:48.421 --> 00:27:52.800
Benjamin Morris on five 38 has a great one,
highly recommend you go read it.

479
00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:56.910
Um,
but so this is where we can see like once we know the outcome,

480
00:27:56.911 --> 00:27:58.650
once we know whether it's good or bad,

481
00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:04.160
it's incredibly hard for us not to then retrofit the decision quality to the

482
00:28:05.221 --> 00:28:09.030
outcomes.
So the answer is,
unless you've got,
unless you're running a Monte Carlo,

483
00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:11.730
which we can't for most things,
um,

484
00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:16.470
what do we do once an outcome as occurred in terms of how do we move forward?

485
00:28:16.471 --> 00:28:18.660
It's like ignore the outcome as much as possible.

486
00:28:18.661 --> 00:28:20.940
It's actually the weird answer to that.
Um,

487
00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:22.440
and I understand it's counterintuitive,

488
00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:25.950
but it's kind of the only way to move forward is like,
okay,
it was one outcome.

489
00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:29.460
I got to think about the decision in absence of that.
And we can,
if you want,

490
00:28:29.461 --> 00:28:31.920
we can talk about strategies for doing that,
but that'd be great.

491
00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:34.200
Cause you mentioned Phil Ivey

492
00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:39.630
every situation,
look at the skill aspect of it.
What can I control,

493
00:28:39.631 --> 00:28:43.760
what can I improve?
And then you have helped me with who,
I guess his quote is,

494
00:28:43.761 --> 00:28:48.660
I'm would be the best poker player of all time if it wasn't for look.
Yes,
yes.

495
00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:50.750
Talk about that spectrum.
Sure.
Yeah.

496
00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:54.720
So there's only two things that determine the way our lives turn out,
uh,

497
00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:56.760
luck and the quality of our decisions.

498
00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.590
So we can't really control the luck element.

499
00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:03.720
So we should try to get down and focus on the quality of the decision.
Um,
so,

500
00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:06.570
uh,
you mentioned Phil Ivey I think is a really good example,

501
00:29:06.571 --> 00:29:08.820
part of the way to do this.
So he,

502
00:29:08.821 --> 00:29:11.700
I tell a story about he wanted a really huge tournament against the really an

503
00:29:11.701 --> 00:29:15.990
all star final table.
Phil Ivy is one of the best poker players in history.
Um,

504
00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.810
and he actually went to dinner with my brother and he spent the whole time

505
00:29:18.811 --> 00:29:20.400
talking about all the mistakes that you've made.

506
00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:26.140
So obviously he's got an interest in cognitive style.
Um,

507
00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:30.850
probably one that's partly responsible for,
for how good he is,
but he,

508
00:29:30.851 --> 00:29:35.670
he gives us actually a clue of how to,
how to handle these kinds of situations.

509
00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:37.740
So there's a variety of different,
um,

510
00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:40.980
what we're trying to do is get to a point where we can all be Phil Ivey.

511
00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:41.920
It's very hard to do.

512
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:45.850
It's very hard to sort of take our great outcomes and look for mistakes.

513
00:29:45.851 --> 00:29:49.420
It's very hard to take our bad outcomes actually and look for it mistakes as

514
00:29:49.421 --> 00:29:51.460
well.
We kind of want to pawn that off on to La.

515
00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:57.060
So what I really talk about in the book is that the way into this is actually to

516
00:29:57.101 --> 00:30:00.700
try to separate outcomes from decision quality as much as possible.
So,

517
00:30:00.701 --> 00:30:01.600
how can we do that?

518
00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:05.530
There's a variety of ways we can do that with tablet sort of strategy number
one,

519
00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:09.230
all of this has done much better in a group by the way.
So,
uh,

520
00:30:09.231 --> 00:30:12.220
and part of that reason is because of this kind of gravity well that we end up

521
00:30:12.221 --> 00:30:14.530
down in,
um,
this is the way our brains work.

522
00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:16.210
It's very hard for us to parse this apart,

523
00:30:16.211 --> 00:30:19.960
but other people can see our bias much better than we can see it in ourselves.

524
00:30:19.961 --> 00:30:22.990
I mean,
you,
you can spot bias thinking a mile away,
right?
So like,

525
00:30:22.991 --> 00:30:26.200
get some people in a group with you who will spot your bias and you'll spot

526
00:30:26.201 --> 00:30:28.780
their bias.
And then here are some things that you can do with that group.

527
00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:32.950
Thing number one is when possible deconstruct decisions before outcomes have

528
00:30:32.951 --> 00:30:37.480
occurred.
So that's really,
really good to do and memorialize it.

529
00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:41.650
So now as you're thinking about the decision,
um,

530
00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:43.660
and what the outcomes might be,

531
00:30:43.661 --> 00:30:45.910
you can write down what you think all the possible outcomes are.

532
00:30:45.911 --> 00:30:48.700
So we can think about this in terms of the Pete Carroll example and there's
like,

533
00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:52.510
okay,
maybe the ball will be caught,
maybe the ball will be draft,

534
00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:53.740
maybe we'll be intercepted.

535
00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:57.550
You try to assign some sort of probability to each of those possible scenarios.

536
00:30:57.850 --> 00:31:00.670
Uh,
you think about what the extra things you're getting out of it or so what are

537
00:31:00.671 --> 00:31:03.460
the payoff in that case,
I'm getting to running plays anyway.

538
00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:08.230
So now what happens is that when the ball gets intercepted,
they're people,

539
00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:08.531
you know,

540
00:31:08.531 --> 00:31:11.950
you're not overreacting to it because you've actually thought about this in

541
00:31:11.951 --> 00:31:14.350
advance and you can actually point and say,
well,

542
00:31:14.351 --> 00:31:15.910
there's the interception scenario.

543
00:31:15.911 --> 00:31:19.630
We thought about that when we thought about the decision and it's happens 1% of

544
00:31:19.631 --> 00:31:24.100
the time.
So let's not overreact to that and like go now change our,

545
00:31:24.101 --> 00:31:25.060
our decision,

546
00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:29.830
the way that we decide in the future to not call that play again because it's

547
00:31:29.831 --> 00:31:30.664
already up there.

548
00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:35.730
So like a trial lawyer can deconstruct their trial strategy before they get,
uh,

549
00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:39.520
you know,
a verdict.
So this,
so that's like one thing you can do when possible,

550
00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:42.910
do as much of the work before you get the outcome.
That's really good.
Uh,

551
00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:46.330
now in poker,
that's actually like literally impossible,
uh,

552
00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:48.800
cause you get the outcome in like 30 seconds.
So,
uh,

553
00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:51.700
there's not a lot of work you can do in that 30 seconds and you can't certainly

554
00:31:51.701 --> 00:31:53.140
can't go off to a group and say,

555
00:31:53.141 --> 00:31:56.650
can we work out the decision tree and then I'll come back to the table and

556
00:31:56.651 --> 00:31:59.740
actually make my decision.
So you can't do that.
So in that case,

557
00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:03.460
what you can do is when you go and you work with whatever your true seeking

558
00:32:03.461 --> 00:32:06.670
group is that you've sort of form to gather the people that you deconstruct

559
00:32:06.671 --> 00:32:07.510
decisions with,

560
00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:13.420
only describe the hand or the question or the decision up to the point that you

561
00:32:13.421 --> 00:32:16.480
need help.
And No,
no further.

562
00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:21.280
So like an example I could give from poker would be,
okay,
I've got a hand.

563
00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:23.440
Uh,
you know,
let's say I had like,
you know,

564
00:32:23.441 --> 00:32:28.441
I have King Queen and I opened the pot for a raise and this other guy ray raises

565
00:32:28.871 --> 00:32:31.630
and he's very aggressive and he actually raises a lot.

566
00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:35.110
And so I was trying to decide,
you know,

567
00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:38.710
should I fold or maybe I should reraise him.

568
00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:44.030
What do you think?
So notice I don't,
I know how the hand turned out.

569
00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:46.280
I know how the person responded.

570
00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:49.010
I know I would give a lot more detailed than that leading up to that.

571
00:32:49.011 --> 00:32:51.650
But I know exactly what happened.
But if I'm asking you,

572
00:32:51.651 --> 00:32:55.370
I'm not telling you because our,
our own bias,

573
00:32:55.371 --> 00:32:59.270
these problems are infectious.
So once I tell you the way it turned out,

574
00:32:59.271 --> 00:33:03.980
like let's say that I told you so I decided to reraise and you then moved all in

575
00:33:03.981 --> 00:33:06.770
on me.
You're going to now make a story,

576
00:33:06.771 --> 00:33:11.240
make sense and you're going to now tell me about the decision in a way that's

577
00:33:11.241 --> 00:33:14.780
going to make the fact that that particular result happened.
Makes Sense.

578
00:33:14.781 --> 00:33:16.670
Because that's just the way our minds like to work.

579
00:33:16.671 --> 00:33:19.310
So I'm just going to leave it out and I'm going only get to tell you to the

580
00:33:19.311 --> 00:33:21.680
point that I have a decision.
So that's one thing I can do.

581
00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:26.270
Another thing I can do is to one person I can tell you what worked out well and

582
00:33:26.271 --> 00:33:29.900
to another person I can tell them it worked out poorly so I can change the

583
00:33:29.901 --> 00:33:30.920
stories end.

584
00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:36.130
I think that's a really interesting exercise to do because you will be amazed at

585
00:33:36.351 --> 00:33:40.040
how different the analysis you get,
what the,

586
00:33:40.041 --> 00:33:44.990
what the advice looks like from the person you tell that it ended well versus

587
00:33:44.991 --> 00:33:46.880
the person that you tell it ended poorly.

588
00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:50.420
And I think that then you can sort of look at those two things and kind of work

589
00:33:50.421 --> 00:33:52.410
to merge them together.
Um,

590
00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:56.510
in order to get some fidelity and your ability to actually understand what the

591
00:33:56.511 --> 00:33:57.470
decision quality is.

592
00:33:57.471 --> 00:34:00.830
So that's like another way that you can sort of not infect people.

593
00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.750
And you can do this in a variety of ways,

594
00:34:02.751 --> 00:34:06.470
not just with outcomes but with your own beliefs.
So like here's a really simple,

595
00:34:06.471 --> 00:34:10.040
so there's a simple problem which is like if you allow people to talk to each

596
00:34:10.041 --> 00:34:12.950
other,
they sort of try to come to consensus and make beliefs.
Makes Sense.

597
00:34:12.951 --> 00:34:15.950
And you're infecting everybody with your beliefs.
So like here's an example.

598
00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:20.100
Let's say that you have for people who have interviewed somebody that you're

599
00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:21.320
thinking about hiring,

600
00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:24.590
don't let them talk to each other and make them give you their opinions right

601
00:34:24.591 --> 00:34:27.770
down their opinion separately.
Because once they talk to each other,
they've,

602
00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:30.680
there's all this that you've literally infected.
It's like a virus.

603
00:34:30.890 --> 00:34:31.671
Another thing is like,

604
00:34:31.671 --> 00:34:35.000
let's say that you're now in front of everybody and you've gotten the advice

605
00:34:35.001 --> 00:34:38.690
from people and now you want to start talking in the room about the advice.

606
00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:43.340
Do not say who you think should be hired because that'll ruin the whole thing.

607
00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:44.391
Right?
So like keep,

608
00:34:44.391 --> 00:34:48.080
keep your own beliefs to yourself when you're trying to get advice from other

609
00:34:48.081 --> 00:34:50.990
people.
Eat.
And this is a simple like in everyday life.

610
00:34:50.991 --> 00:34:53.840
If I read an article on politics when,

611
00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:56.720
if I'm asking you what your opinion of the article is,

612
00:34:56.750 --> 00:35:00.500
I should not say what my belief about that is because then I've ruined the whole

613
00:35:00.501 --> 00:35:04.670
thing.
Right.
So I think that that's really what you should do with it.

614
00:35:04.671 --> 00:35:08.990
It's kind of like unless you've got a large enough end,
which is rare,

615
00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:14.560
you should kind of leave it out where to where to outcomes help you.

616
00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:17.660
Well you know obviously throughout your life as you kind of get them in,

617
00:35:17.661 --> 00:35:20.150
they might be prompts for you to go in and say,

618
00:35:20.151 --> 00:35:23.600
well maybe I should look at the decision quality,
but it should be both.

619
00:35:23.601 --> 00:35:25.200
In the case of whether you won or loss,

620
00:35:25.201 --> 00:35:28.580
it should be a prompt to go in and look at the decision quality and when you go

621
00:35:28.581 --> 00:35:31.190
in and look at the decision quality and you go want to talk to other people

622
00:35:31.191 --> 00:35:32.000
about it,

623
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.270
you're going to do better because you've been prompted by the outcome to leave

624
00:35:35.271 --> 00:35:38.910
the outcome out as you're going to actually improve the decision quality.

625
00:35:38.911 --> 00:35:40.920
It's a little counter intuitive,
but no,
there isn't.

626
00:35:40.930 --> 00:35:44.190
There's some situations where just sitting out and not making a decision.

627
00:35:44.191 --> 00:35:47.970
Make Sense.
Cause you mentioned that most poker players,
like 80% of the hands,

628
00:35:47.971 --> 00:35:52.770
they don't make any actions on his like 20th they play.
Yeah.
So,

629
00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:56.100
um,
it's,
so in poker,

630
00:35:56.940 --> 00:36:00.360
one of the biggest mistakes that people make is actually playing way too many

631
00:36:00.361 --> 00:36:01.540
hands.
Um,

632
00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:04.350
and you always need to think about when you're actually going to enter into

633
00:36:04.351 --> 00:36:06.120
something you need to be selective.

634
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:09.740
So I want to talk about sort of both sides of this puzzle.
Um,

635
00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:12.030
one is that just doing stuff isn't enough.

636
00:36:12.031 --> 00:36:13.530
Like I may think a lot of times people are like,

637
00:36:13.531 --> 00:36:15.120
just throw a lot of spaghetti against the wall,

638
00:36:15.121 --> 00:36:17.640
but you should actually think about each strand and make sure you're getting a

639
00:36:17.641 --> 00:36:21.450
payoff for the strand.
So,
uh,
the fact is yes,

640
00:36:21.451 --> 00:36:23.490
if you throw a bunch of Spaghetti against the wall,

641
00:36:23.491 --> 00:36:26.520
some of that will pay off in some of it won't.
But like,

642
00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:29.310
and I think that people look at that and they look at like for example,

643
00:36:29.311 --> 00:36:31.620
vcs and they think what,
that's what their strategy is,

644
00:36:31.621 --> 00:36:34.680
that they're just sort of like playing every hand and then some of them pay off

645
00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:37.530
and you know when they pay off,
they're really happy.
But that's not true.

646
00:36:37.531 --> 00:36:40.410
They're there.
They are spreading their bets across a large basket,

647
00:36:40.411 --> 00:36:44.700
but they're actually vetting each of the bets that they're making to make sure

648
00:36:44.701 --> 00:36:46.050
that they,
given what they know,

649
00:36:46.051 --> 00:36:47.760
they think that the payoff is going to be big enough.

650
00:36:47.761 --> 00:36:51.210
So that's similar to what a poker player does.
So that's number one.

651
00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:55.500
But then number two that I think is really important to think about is that

652
00:36:55.501 --> 00:37:00.501
don't take that to the point of thinking that somehow making a decision is

653
00:37:00.751 --> 00:37:04.320
substantively different from not making a decision because they're both

654
00:37:04.321 --> 00:37:05.154
decisions.

655
00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:10.250
So you have whatever the status quo is and when you're going along and just kind

656
00:37:10.501 --> 00:37:12.300
of going with the status quo,
trust me,

657
00:37:12.301 --> 00:37:14.400
you're making a decision every single time you do that.

658
00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:18.570
So I think that when we're trying to sort of think about doing these scenario

659
00:37:18.571 --> 00:37:20.820
plans and imagining what the future might look like,

660
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.970
we only think about it in terms of decisions that we think are new.

661
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:29.340
We're somehow,
we're changing course but not changing courses,

662
00:37:29.341 --> 00:37:30.780
a decision in and of itself.

663
00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:35.640
So you should be taking time frequently to look at what the status quo is,

664
00:37:35.641 --> 00:37:36.720
to look at what you're doing,

665
00:37:36.721 --> 00:37:40.740
the strategies that you've always just kind of been applying and do the exact

666
00:37:40.741 --> 00:37:44.040
same kind of analysis on that as if it were a new decision.

667
00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:46.710
So let me give you like a super simple example.

668
00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:51.660
So like the simplest example ever,
you're in a grocery store and there's like,

669
00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:55.920
you know,
six lanes open and you're Einstein at this moment.

670
00:37:55.921 --> 00:37:59.460
Like you're literally doing some kind of quantum physics analysis about which

671
00:37:59.461 --> 00:38:02.190
line you're supposed to get into.
You're laughing because you know it's true.

672
00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:06.860
So it's like,
you know,
you're looking for the lady with the coupons and you know,

673
00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:11.200
the cashier that looks maybe like,
you know,
oh he's,
he seems a little slow,

674
00:38:11.201 --> 00:38:13.950
or he's newer,
he's a trainee.
Or,
you know,

675
00:38:13.951 --> 00:38:17.640
the person who has 17,000 things in their cart versus,
you know,
whatever.

676
00:38:17.641 --> 00:38:18.080
I mean you're,

677
00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:23.080
it's like literally like you are completely calculating this stuff out.

678
00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:26.520
Okay,
so now,
so because that's a new decision,
right?

679
00:38:26.521 --> 00:38:28.620
So you're like calculating out all the scenarios,

680
00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:31.890
trying to figure out like which is going to give me the best future because

681
00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:34.140
you're now investing your time,
right?
So this is like,

682
00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:39.680
this is very clearly a bet you're betting on a line and you think that the you,

683
00:38:39.791 --> 00:38:42.820
that results from choosing whatever line it is that you go to,

684
00:38:42.821 --> 00:38:47.140
it's going to save time over the you that results from whatever other line you

685
00:38:47.141 --> 00:38:50.110
might choose.
So that's like your,
and that's what most bets are.

686
00:38:50.111 --> 00:38:51.370
You're not betting against other people,

687
00:38:51.371 --> 00:38:54.250
you're betting against other versions of yourself,
right?

688
00:38:54.251 --> 00:38:58.540
Like Annie that chooses lie a versus anti that chooses line be or like I'm in

689
00:38:58.541 --> 00:39:01.900
the restaurant Andy that chooses the chicken or anti that chooses the fish or

690
00:39:01.901 --> 00:39:06.550
whatever.
So anti that chooses demoine Moines versus anti that chooses Las Vegas.

691
00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:07.061
Okay.

692
00:39:07.061 --> 00:39:11.290
So now you choose a line and you get in the line and the line turns out to be

693
00:39:11.291 --> 00:39:15.730
slow.
What do you do?
Not you stay in the line,
right?
You don't move.

694
00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:17.530
But it's a new decision.

695
00:39:17.531 --> 00:39:21.850
Like once you figure out the line is slow switch,

696
00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:25.300
but you don't because you know why?
Because you're worried about like,

697
00:39:25.301 --> 00:39:28.630
now if I switch,
what if that line,
my line starts moving faster,

698
00:39:28.631 --> 00:39:32.110
I'll feel like I made a mistake.
But at any moment it's the same decision.

699
00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:35.530
So if you treat the status quo as if like,

700
00:39:35.531 --> 00:39:37.690
that's not a decision in and of itself,

701
00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:41.140
what happens is you actually end up not changing course enough.

702
00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:43.420
So I this actually,

703
00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:47.370
we can go back to the Pete Carroll example to think about this.
Um,

704
00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:51.280
let's do the other thought experiment where Pete Carroll just doesn't change as

705
00:39:51.281 --> 00:39:53.830
grocery line,
right?
So he hands it off to Marshawn Lynch,
right?

706
00:39:53.831 --> 00:39:56.260
That was the expected play.
That's the status quo play.

707
00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:58.210
And let's say he doesn't score.

708
00:39:58.211 --> 00:40:02.380
What do you think the headlines look like the next day?
A New England's good.

709
00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:05.020
Like,
literally,
nobody's like,

710
00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:08.380
oh he's the worst coach in Superbowl history cause he handed up to Marshawn

711
00:40:08.381 --> 00:40:12.340
lynch and he didn't score.
Why?
Because people aren't viewing that as a decision,

712
00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:16.030
right?
Like that's just the status quo.
We already have consensus around that.

713
00:40:16.031 --> 00:40:19.780
Clearly if he doesn't win,
then it's not the decision quality.

714
00:40:19.781 --> 00:40:23.740
Now we can firmly stick it in the luck bucket because nobody's questioning the

715
00:40:23.741 --> 00:40:27.280
status quo.
So now I must be something that's outside of his control.

716
00:40:27.281 --> 00:40:29.110
So included in luck would be some,
for example,

717
00:40:29.111 --> 00:40:32.470
the quality of the defensive line of New England would be included in luck.

718
00:40:32.471 --> 00:40:35.800
Luck is anything you don't that you yourself don't control.
Okay.

719
00:40:35.801 --> 00:40:38.860
So and that's because like all right,
he chose his grocery line,

720
00:40:38.890 --> 00:40:43.440
like he's not switching.
So the reason why Pete Carroll got so,
um,

721
00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:47.230
demolished in that decision is because he switched grocery lines.

722
00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:50.050
But he was right to do that.
Like that's how progress gets made.

723
00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:55.560
<v 0>I find her daily life too.
Sometimes as a result happens,</v>

724
00:40:55.890 --> 00:40:59.790
we'll look at the person who made a decision and then we'll say to herself,
well,

725
00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:04.230
if they went their way,
then odds are it's luck.
But if it would have failed,

726
00:41:04.231 --> 00:41:08.460
it's like,
you know,
it's mostly due to their like incompetencies or whatnot.

727
00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:09.783
Um,
do we,

728
00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:14.370
is there mechanisms where we can be more like cognizant of that when we fall in

729
00:41:14.371 --> 00:41:15.204
to that mode?

730
00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:19.090
<v 2>Yeah.
So I,
so I,
I've talked about this particular thing resulting,</v>

731
00:41:19.091 --> 00:41:23.200
which is where we like really tightly connect outcomes and decisions.
So,

732
00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:25.180
but there's two ways that we do this.

733
00:41:25.181 --> 00:41:28.540
One is like we're looking at someone from afar,
like Pete Carroll.
Okay.

734
00:41:28.541 --> 00:41:32.410
So he's not in our reference group,
right?
Like we don't compare ourselves to him.

735
00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:36.020
And so that case we just looked like bad outcome means bad decision.

736
00:41:36.021 --> 00:41:38.000
Good outcome means a good decision.

737
00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:40.850
So it's interesting cause we do a pattern for ourselves.

738
00:41:40.851 --> 00:41:41.900
It's a little bit different.

739
00:41:41.901 --> 00:41:45.080
So if anybody's read thinking fast and slow from Daniel Conoman,

740
00:41:45.081 --> 00:41:46.340
you'll remember from this,
from this,

741
00:41:46.341 --> 00:41:49.670
that we're really trying to drive a positive narrative or of our lives,
right?

742
00:41:49.671 --> 00:41:52.760
We want to think that we're good actors and we're smart and so on,
so forth.

743
00:41:52.761 --> 00:41:56.420
So obviously,
um,
this goes in the motivated reasoning category.

744
00:41:56.421 --> 00:41:58.490
Like if we have a bad outcome for ourselves,

745
00:41:58.491 --> 00:42:02.150
if I lose a hand at poker that doesn't really jive with this positive self

746
00:42:02.151 --> 00:42:05.870
narrative,
at least not in the moment.
Okay.
So then what do we do?

747
00:42:05.871 --> 00:42:08.990
Now remember we've got this noise in the system,
right?

748
00:42:08.991 --> 00:42:11.900
We got the hidden information and luck when I have a bad,

749
00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:13.880
when I lose a hand at poker,
it's because of luck.

750
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:17.780
When I went ahead and had pokers cause I'm a genius.
Um,

751
00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:19.520
that's called self serving bias.

752
00:42:19.521 --> 00:42:22.760
I feel it feel like it's pretty self explanatory name for that particular bias.

753
00:42:23.130 --> 00:42:27.710
Um,
and we do this in all areas of our lives.
When someone gets a promotion,

754
00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:31.220
um,
you know,
it's not,
it's bad luck for us.

755
00:42:31.221 --> 00:42:33.920
Like it's not like we didn't do the work or we didn't,
you know,

756
00:42:33.921 --> 00:42:37.220
obviously we deserved it.
It was just like bad luck.
It wasn't in our control.

757
00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:40.550
Actually car car accidents are an interesting place to look.
Over.

758
00:42:40.551 --> 00:42:45.020
90% of a two car accidents are reported as the other person's fault.

759
00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:48.470
Um,
this is a pretty good one.
I think it's 37%.

760
00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:52.520
I think of single car accidents as reported as not the person's fault.

761
00:42:53.090 --> 00:42:54.380
I don't know.
You go figure that one out.

762
00:42:54.830 --> 00:42:59.560
So that's how strong this biases right now.
What's interesting is it,

763
00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:03.950
but the number of decisions that we make in our lives is obviously much less

764
00:43:03.951 --> 00:43:06.530
than the number of decisions we're able to observe and other people.

765
00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:10.250
So let's assume that we were okay were crappy for ourselves,

766
00:43:10.251 --> 00:43:13.160
but it doesn't matter cause then we get to feel good about ourselves.

767
00:43:13.161 --> 00:43:16.100
But we're really good at analyzing everybody else's decisions.

768
00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:19.200
But the problem is as soon as someone's in our reference group,
as soon as some,

769
00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:22.790
it's someone that we feel like we're comparing ourselves to sort of figure out

770
00:43:22.791 --> 00:43:24.740
what our self worth is because we don't do that.

771
00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:28.280
Our happiness doesn't derive an absence of the way that we compare to other

772
00:43:28.281 --> 00:43:33.230
people.
Now what we do is the reverse pattern,
right?

773
00:43:33.231 --> 00:43:35.720
When they do something good,
it's because they got lucky.

774
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:38.630
And when they do something bad,
it's because they're a really bad decision maker.

775
00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:42.500
So when they,
uh,
you know,
when a hand of poker,

776
00:43:42.501 --> 00:43:45.590
it's because they got lucky and when they lose a hand of poker it's because

777
00:43:45.591 --> 00:43:46.610
they're a bad decision maker.

778
00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:50.390
Now you can kind of see actually if you think about poker,
which is zero sum,

779
00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:54.470
how these two problems might have emerged,
right?

780
00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:57.290
Because looking at a zero sum game like poker,

781
00:43:57.291 --> 00:43:58.940
you can see how that pattern happens.

782
00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:04.210
So if I'm trying to offload my bad results to luck and I lose a hand

783
00:44:04.341 --> 00:44:05.570
specifically to you,

784
00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:09.560
I can't say that you won the hand because of skill that doesn't work.

785
00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:12.140
So I have to say that you lost the hand because of luck.

786
00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:14.050
Cause cause I'm trying to put my bat,
you know,

787
00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:16.250
I'm trying to say it's bad luck for me.
So therefore it must be good.

788
00:44:16.251 --> 00:44:19.700
Look for you.
And if I win a hand because of lot of skill rather,

789
00:44:19.701 --> 00:44:22.760
I can't say that you lost because of luck.
It doesn't jive.
It's just that,

790
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:25.070
you know,
so we sort of treat everything like it's zero Sam,

791
00:44:25.071 --> 00:44:25.940
like when we shouldn't,

792
00:44:25.941 --> 00:44:29.240
but you can see how that happens when I specifically think I'm referring to you

793
00:44:29.241 --> 00:44:33.330
when you're in my reference group.
So again,
like how do we,

794
00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:34.410
how do we solve for this?

795
00:44:34.411 --> 00:44:38.070
Well I'm going to go back to that group idea form a really,

796
00:44:38.071 --> 00:44:41.010
really good decision group that has different values.

797
00:44:41.011 --> 00:44:44.430
So there's different ways that we can derive good feelings from ourselves,
right?

798
00:44:44.431 --> 00:44:48.900
So our natural tendency is to try to offload it in the moment so that we don't

799
00:44:48.901 --> 00:44:52.080
have to have a negative update to our self image and we don't ever miss out on a

800
00:44:52.081 --> 00:44:53.850
positive update to our self image.
Right?

801
00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:56.460
Because if I say that I won because I got lucky,

802
00:44:56.461 --> 00:44:57.960
I don't get that positive update.

803
00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:01.740
And if I say that I lost because of something I did,

804
00:45:01.741 --> 00:45:03.060
I don't get that positive update.

805
00:45:03.061 --> 00:45:06.630
And that sort of the natural way that were like getting our pellets,

806
00:45:06.631 --> 00:45:10.050
like we're pressing a lever in a Skinner box is that that's where appellate's

807
00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:13.170
are coming from.
But very early in my poker career,

808
00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:17.200
I went up to somebody named Erik Seidel,
has an amazing poker player,

809
00:45:17.201 --> 00:45:20.910
is one over $38 million in his career.
So he's really,
really good.

810
00:45:21.390 --> 00:45:23.310
I had met him when I was actually 16,

811
00:45:23.311 --> 00:45:26.040
and I didn't start playing poker professionally until I was 26,

812
00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:29.190
so he was just like a buddy of mine.
Um,

813
00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:32.190
and then all of a sudden I'm 26 and now he's a professional peer.

814
00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:36.900
So I remember I was in a tournament,
I got knocked out,
you know,

815
00:45:36.901 --> 00:45:41.400
and obviously something unlucky happened to me clearly.
Um,

816
00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:45.660
and I went up to Eric Sydell and I went to go what's called moaning.

817
00:45:45.661 --> 00:45:49.320
I went to go complain to him about,
I can't believe this.
I had such bad luck.

818
00:45:49.321 --> 00:45:52.170
I had this hand and hey man,
uh,
the normal,

819
00:45:52.830 --> 00:45:56.640
and he actually laid this out for me.
How do we solve for this?

820
00:45:56.641 --> 00:45:58.950
And like the most beautiful way,
it's going to sound kind of brutal,

821
00:45:58.951 --> 00:46:01.470
but I'm so thankful for it.
So why are you telling me this?
Like,

822
00:46:01.471 --> 00:46:03.120
you think I'm not losing myself?
Like,

823
00:46:03.121 --> 00:46:06.570
why are you offloading your negative emotions onto me?
I don't need that.

824
00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:10.680
If you really lost because of bad luck,
there's nothing to be learned from it.

825
00:46:10.681 --> 00:46:14.300
So I would like you to not offload your emotional distress onto me.

826
00:46:14.310 --> 00:46:18.240
Thank you very much.
However,
if you have a question,

827
00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:22.620
if there's something that you're trying to ask me about strategy,
I'm all ears.

828
00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:26.310
So let's think about what he did there.
He said,

829
00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:30.630
if you're not focusing on accuracy,
I don't care.
What does that mean?

830
00:46:30.631 --> 00:46:33.690
This focus on accuracy.
Let's think about the division division,

831
00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:36.390
division between the distinction between,
uh,

832
00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:38.580
reasoning to be accurate and reasoning to be right.

833
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.360
Reasoning to be right is I just want my priors to be right.

834
00:46:42.810 --> 00:46:44.970
So I'm just going to reason to prove that I'm right all the time,

835
00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:49.470
right reasoning to be accurate.
That's funny that I said right,
right after that,

836
00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:50.520
um,

837
00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:54.480
reasoning to be accurate is I'm trying to construct the most accurate model of

838
00:46:54.481 --> 00:46:58.080
the objective truth.
And if you think about who's going to win in a bat,

839
00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:01.110
the person who's reasoning to be right versus the person who's reason it'd be

840
00:47:01.111 --> 00:47:04.860
accurate.
That's why when I say do you do want to bet,

841
00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:06.600
it takes you out of the right mode,

842
00:47:06.601 --> 00:47:09.090
right into the accurate mode because everybody understands,

843
00:47:09.091 --> 00:47:11.610
like if I'm going to bet on it,
I better be reasoning to be accurate.

844
00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:13.530
So he told me,
you have to be reasoning to be accurate.

845
00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:16.920
What you're doing right now is reasoning.
If we write you're sad,
you lost,

846
00:47:16.921 --> 00:47:20.490
it's not your fault,
blah,
blah,
blah.
That doesn't,
that doesn't help anybody.

847
00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:21.540
But if you have a question,

848
00:47:21.541 --> 00:47:24.600
if you want to know whether you accurately played the hand,
let's talk about it.

849
00:47:24.601 --> 00:47:25.830
So he told me that the,

850
00:47:25.831 --> 00:47:28.200
that I have to think about accuracy if I'm talking to him,

851
00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:31.570
he told me he was to be,
hold me accountable to that because he did.

852
00:47:31.571 --> 00:47:34.180
In that moment he was holding me accountable to the way I was thinking.

853
00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:34.661
And he said,

854
00:47:34.661 --> 00:47:38.380
you're going to have to be open to maybe things aren't the way that you want

855
00:47:38.381 --> 00:47:39.214
them to be.

856
00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:42.310
So I was going to have to be open to diverse opinions and other people's

857
00:47:42.311 --> 00:47:46.570
perspectives.
So let's take those three things.
There's a great group charter,

858
00:47:47.170 --> 00:47:50.320
right?
You have to have a focus on accuracy of commitment to accuracy.

859
00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:53.650
You have to hold each other accountable to these things and you have to be open

860
00:47:53.651 --> 00:47:57.220
to diverse viewpoints.
That seems like a pretty good charter.

861
00:47:57.610 --> 00:48:00.760
And what's really wonderful about what Eric did for me in that moment,

862
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:04.160
we remained friends cause I was thankful for this.
Um,

863
00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:07.450
I was a little upset in the moment,
but I got over it.
I,
I saw it,

864
00:48:07.470 --> 00:48:12.040
I saw the value eventually.
Um,
but what he did for me was two things.

865
00:48:12.041 --> 00:48:15.550
One is now I understood that when I went and talked to him,

866
00:48:15.551 --> 00:48:17.890
he was going to mentor me,
he was going to teach me how to play.

867
00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:21.970
So when I had hand questions I could actually deconstruct them with him and that

868
00:48:21.971 --> 00:48:25.210
was going to be super helpful for me.
So that was a little bit of the help.

869
00:48:25.211 --> 00:48:28.360
But the big help he gave me was when I went back and played on my own.

870
00:48:28.361 --> 00:48:30.220
So when you're playing poker,
it's all on your own.

871
00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:33.670
I was processing what was happening at the table differently,

872
00:48:34.570 --> 00:48:38.560
so I'm not processing.
Oh,
I got unlucky.
Oh,
I'm so smart.
Oh,
I got unlucky.
Oh,

873
00:48:38.561 --> 00:48:42.280
I'm so smart because that's not good material for me to go back to Eric with.

874
00:48:42.281 --> 00:48:42.581
Right.

875
00:48:42.581 --> 00:48:45.580
And I know later on he's going to hold me accountable and if I want to have a

876
00:48:45.581 --> 00:48:48.670
really good discussion with him,
I have to come to them with good material.

877
00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:52.060
So now it changes the way that I'm viewing what's happening at the table in the

878
00:48:52.061 --> 00:48:55.960
moment so that I'm looking for mistakes.
I'm looking for questions,

879
00:48:55.961 --> 00:48:59.170
I'm looking for other people where other people might be out playing me,

880
00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:02.500
where they might be winning because they're better than I am and I'm going to go

881
00:49:02.501 --> 00:49:05.410
tell him and now this is what happens.
This is so great.

882
00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:09.610
Two great things happen from that thing.
Number one,
I go back to them and I say,

883
00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:11.080
you know what?
I think I really butchered a hand.

884
00:49:11.081 --> 00:49:14.350
I think I really made a mistake and he gives me a pellet,
right?

885
00:49:14.351 --> 00:49:18.310
So he wasn't giving me pellets for pressing the luck.
You know,

886
00:49:18.311 --> 00:49:21.620
I just got unlucky lever,
right?
He's giving me pellets for the,

887
00:49:21.621 --> 00:49:24.730
I think I made a mistake lever.
So that's really great.
So that,

888
00:49:24.731 --> 00:49:29.020
now that becomes part of myself narrative,
right?
Eric Sydell wants to talk to me.

889
00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:32.260
He thinks I'm smart,
right?
So I'm getting those.
I'm getting,
I wouldn't,

890
00:49:32.290 --> 00:49:35.410
I'm not like I practice mindfulness,

891
00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:39.820
but I don't think I'm ever achieving like the,
you know,
on the mountain in Tibet,

892
00:49:40.090 --> 00:49:43.420
not worried about what the world thinks of me.
I'm trying,

893
00:49:43.421 --> 00:49:47.400
but I'm not going to get there.
So Eric Sydell is giving me that,
right?
He's,

894
00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:51.970
he's helping me to think better by giving me the right kind of pellet.
Right?

895
00:49:51.971 --> 00:49:54.520
That's number one.
And then number two,
again,
back to the,

896
00:49:54.521 --> 00:49:57.400
I'm trying to be a monk on top of a mountain in Tibet.

897
00:49:57.401 --> 00:50:00.360
I'm really trying hard for that mindfulness,
that,

898
00:50:00.370 --> 00:50:03.800
that ultimate mindfulness practice.
But,
um,
I'm kind of failing at and I'm just,

899
00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:07.480
but I'm working on it.
I'm trying,
I'm practicing it.
But in the meantime,

900
00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:12.160
if we go back to that tribalism and how does our tribe feel distinct from
others?

901
00:50:12.730 --> 00:50:16.420
Think about what it did for me when I walked up to Eric and my group and I was

902
00:50:16.421 --> 00:50:18.430
saying,
I really think I made a mistake,

903
00:50:18.730 --> 00:50:22.330
but when I'm walking down the hall of the Poker Room,

904
00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:25.240
I'm hearing all these people go,
can you believe how unlucky I got ya?

905
00:50:25.241 --> 00:50:28.520
I got so unlucky to,
yeah,
oh,
that an idiot,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah.

906
00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:31.850
And that's what those tribes are,
how they are talking to each other.

907
00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:34.700
So I got my distinctiveness in the mix too.

908
00:50:34.701 --> 00:50:37.940
So it was like I got my cake and I got to eat it too,
which was kind of good.

909
00:50:37.941 --> 00:50:39.110
And then in the meantime,

910
00:50:39.111 --> 00:50:42.140
I'm doing a mindfulness practice and trying not to worry about any of that,

911
00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:44.810
but until I can't,
you know,
until I get there,

912
00:50:45.590 --> 00:50:47.750
I get to reinforce all of these good,
you know,

913
00:50:47.810 --> 00:50:51.380
changes and cognitive style through what the group is giving me.

914
00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:55.490
<v 0>So I want to ask you one more question before I go to the audience.
Um,</v>

915
00:50:55.730 --> 00:50:57.450
it seems like what you're,
you're talking about,

916
00:50:57.451 --> 00:51:00.830
it's not just applicable to the poker world.
No,
it's for sure not.

917
00:51:01.110 --> 00:51:04.310
I see the investment world.
I see family,
things like that.

918
00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:07.520
Where have you seen these skills kind of like spill over for you and your life?

919
00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:12.690
<v 2>Oh my gosh.
Uh,
everywhere.
Um,
so I want to say two things.</v>

920
00:51:12.691 --> 00:51:13.471
One is this,

921
00:51:13.471 --> 00:51:16.680
these skills have definitely spilled over in all areas of my life and I'm

922
00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:20.770
terrible at them.
Um,
so the,

923
00:51:21.090 --> 00:51:23.490
the thing is like these,
the,
this,

924
00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:28.670
the way that we process information is so built in that our goal is really to be

925
00:51:29.131 --> 00:51:32.580
a little bit better at it.
Um,
and if you're a little bit better at it,

926
00:51:32.581 --> 00:51:33.750
it's going to compound over time.

927
00:51:33.751 --> 00:51:36.450
It's going to really make a difference in your overall decision quality and the

928
00:51:36.451 --> 00:51:38.520
quality of the outcomes that you eventually have.

929
00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:42.210
So I still mess up all the time.
Trust me.
Bad things have to me.
I go,

930
00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:43.710
I can blue that.
Oh,
so unlucky.

931
00:51:44.010 --> 00:51:47.880
It's just that I catch myself hopefully more often and hopefully a little bit

932
00:51:47.881 --> 00:51:51.720
faster than I otherwise would.
But I know I'm still missing a lot of those.

933
00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:55.860
I mean,
I'm still biased,
so that's number one.
But number two,

934
00:51:55.861 --> 00:51:57.750
in terms of areas of my life,
like everywhere,

935
00:51:58.290 --> 00:52:01.110
so like in the way that I parent my children and the way that I talked to my

936
00:52:01.111 --> 00:52:04.860
partner and the way that I,
the process of writing this book,
you know,

937
00:52:04.861 --> 00:52:09.861
where you have to be like you're working with an editor and you have to not sort

938
00:52:10.051 --> 00:52:14.370
of like push off what they're saying because you feel so much ownership over the

939
00:52:14.371 --> 00:52:16.440
word words and you know better than they do.

940
00:52:16.441 --> 00:52:19.980
It's like trying to have open mindedness and really use the editor and your

941
00:52:19.981 --> 00:52:21.210
agent and so and so forth.

942
00:52:21.211 --> 00:52:24.450
It's like that kind of truth seeking group that you're trying to come up with

943
00:52:24.451 --> 00:52:26.130
the best representation of your ideas.

944
00:52:26.131 --> 00:52:30.990
And that's not necessarily all the ideas of how you think it should be
presented,

945
00:52:30.991 --> 00:52:35.100
that you have to be open minded to that.
Um,
you know,

946
00:52:35.101 --> 00:52:36.540
just like I say,

947
00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:39.930
like in terms of the way that I talk to my kids and I guide my kids,
like I,

948
00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:44.700
you know,
every teenager that has,
I've raised is,
comes back from school.

949
00:52:44.701 --> 00:52:47.700
I can't believe I did so bad on the test is because the teacher was mean.

950
00:52:47.701 --> 00:52:51.150
And they gave me things that they didn't even teach in class and it was really

951
00:52:51.151 --> 00:52:53.370
hard.
And you can ask anybody,
right?

952
00:52:53.371 --> 00:52:56.970
So like how are you talking to somebody about that?
And um,
you know,
saying,

953
00:52:57.060 --> 00:52:59.040
saying,
well with kids it's,
it's,

954
00:52:59.130 --> 00:53:01.950
you don't want to be challenging them in the same way,
but you say,
okay,
that's,

955
00:53:01.951 --> 00:53:05.220
I'm sorry about that.
So what are you going to do about that?
Like in the future,

956
00:53:05.221 --> 00:53:06.720
how do you think you're going to solve for that?

957
00:53:06.930 --> 00:53:09.570
So really trying to get them to understand like what are the things that are

958
00:53:09.571 --> 00:53:12.540
under your control and what aren't.
So not in an Eric Sydell way,

959
00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:15.270
but trying to say like,
okay,
how can you do better?
Like,

960
00:53:15.271 --> 00:53:18.480
how can you make it so that maybe you should go talk to the teacher,
you know,

961
00:53:18.481 --> 00:53:20.040
before the next test,
if,
you know,

962
00:53:20.041 --> 00:53:23.190
they might put things on the test that they didn't teach.
So like that,
you know,

963
00:53:23.191 --> 00:53:26.940
not so much disagreeing with them because I'm not,
you know,
they're not adults.

964
00:53:27.210 --> 00:53:27.990
Um,

965
00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:31.530
but trying to get them to focus more on those things that are in their control.

966
00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:34.710
But also just in terms of like when I was writing the book,
I was thinking like,

967
00:53:34.711 --> 00:53:35.071
okay,

968
00:53:35.071 --> 00:53:38.940
it's going to be a certain amount of time that I'm going to have to invest what,

969
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.670
you know,
am I going to get,
what am I going to get in return?

970
00:53:41.671 --> 00:53:42.870
What does the future look like?

971
00:53:42.871 --> 00:53:45.450
Like I thought about the book could be a total flop.

972
00:53:45.450 --> 00:53:48.480
I have to think about that in advance.
And is that going to feel okay for me?

973
00:53:48.481 --> 00:53:51.390
Is it going to be worthwhile to have written the book even if nobody ever reads

974
00:53:51.391 --> 00:53:56.250
it?
Um,
so it's like really kind of everywhere.
Um,
and then,

975
00:53:56.310 --> 00:53:57.900
you know,
really recognizing.

976
00:53:58.110 --> 00:54:01.980
The other thing is I'm a big believer in Ulysses contracts because I really

977
00:54:01.981 --> 00:54:06.540
understand that as much as you.
Yeah,
sorry.
Yeah,
you're right.

978
00:54:06.541 --> 00:54:10.980
I'm assuming.
Um,
so Ulysses contract is thinking in advance about places where,

979
00:54:10.981 --> 00:54:11.221
you know,

980
00:54:11.221 --> 00:54:15.170
you're going to be really biased and it's going to be hard to overcome this,
um,

981
00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:18.360
in order to kind of prevent yourself from acting irrationally.

982
00:54:18.361 --> 00:54:22.560
So we don't always have a group of other people around us to help us,

983
00:54:22.561 --> 00:54:24.810
but you can actually form a different kind of group,
which is a,

984
00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:28.200
a group of the past versions of you in the future versions of you to all kind of

985
00:54:28.201 --> 00:54:30.750
come to help gather and help the present version of you.

986
00:54:31.110 --> 00:54:35.640
So the classic example is from Greek literature.
Odysseus was,
you know,

987
00:54:35.730 --> 00:54:38.910
sailing along and he knew he was going to come to the island of the sirens.

988
00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:42.840
And the sirens were these beautiful Nims that sang on the shore.

989
00:54:42.841 --> 00:54:47.790
And the song was so irresistible to the ears of any man that they would steer

990
00:54:47.791 --> 00:54:49.260
their ship toward the shore.

991
00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:54.840
The shore was a rocky shoals that would break the ship apart,
sudden death.
So,

992
00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:57.870
uh,
Ulysses,
which is the Roman name for Odysseus,

993
00:54:57.871 --> 00:55:02.310
knew this and asked his crew to tie his hands to the mast of the ship.

994
00:55:02.670 --> 00:55:06.360
So this is a really good example of forming a group that's different versions of

995
00:55:06.361 --> 00:55:08.130
you.
So,
uh,

996
00:55:08.131 --> 00:55:11.520
Odysseus said future Odysseus is really going to have a problem cause future

997
00:55:11.521 --> 00:55:14.160
Odysseus is going to steer toward the shore.

998
00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:19.430
So I'm going to tie future Odysseus's hands to stop him from doing that.

999
00:55:20.580 --> 00:55:23.980
So I think there's all sorts of places where you can recognize,
um,

1000
00:55:24.330 --> 00:55:25.920
that you might need help in the future.

1001
00:55:25.921 --> 00:55:29.910
Like a simple example would be take a ride sharing service to a bar.
Um,

1002
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:34.350
that's a way to tie your hands.
I,
you know,
for me with exercising,

1003
00:55:34.351 --> 00:55:37.800
I sign up for classes in advance so that I've got my schedule worked out and I

1004
00:55:37.801 --> 00:55:40.990
feel that some,
you know,
that I have a commitment to that.
Um,

1005
00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:44.490
I only have certain kinds of foods in the house.
Um,
you know,

1006
00:55:44.491 --> 00:55:45.840
these are all examples of,

1007
00:55:45.930 --> 00:55:49.470
of Ulysses contracts and I'm a huge fan of those and I apply those across my

1008
00:55:49.471 --> 00:55:53.320
whole life,
including actually in writing the book,
which was instead of,
uh,

1009
00:55:53.350 --> 00:55:57.270
instead of ever letting my editor set the deadline for me,
um,

1010
00:55:57.480 --> 00:55:59.790
because that is more like someone telling me what to do,

1011
00:55:59.791 --> 00:56:03.390
which doesn't feel this as like a contract.
I said all my own deadlines.
So I,

1012
00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:05.960
I would tell her what day,
um,

1013
00:56:06.030 --> 00:56:08.760
I actually would usually give her three days in a confidence interval around

1014
00:56:08.761 --> 00:56:13.680
each one
because,
you know,
well obviously cause I wrote this book,

1015
00:56:13.830 --> 00:56:15.420
So,
uh,
so it would be with it,

1016
00:56:15.421 --> 00:56:18.030
but there would be a week that I would know that I had to turn it in.

1017
00:56:18.031 --> 00:56:19.770
And I would say,
you know,
Monday,

1018
00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:24.800
it's 60% on Monday and 80% Tuesday and I'm 98% on Friday.

1019
00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:31.300
So,
um,
so by setting that myself,
I was creating a contract.
Um,
and then,
you know,

1020
00:56:31.301 --> 00:56:34.690
I held to the deadline and actually got the book in early because I was,
uh,

1021
00:56:34.750 --> 00:56:36.430
because I was applying Ulysses contracts.

1022
00:56:36.431 --> 00:56:38.380
So I really do practice what I preached in the book.

1023
00:56:38.450 --> 00:56:40.870
It's an excellent concept and I'm just realizing,
oh my God,

1024
00:56:40.871 --> 00:56:43.810
I didn't see that because I was writing a letter to someone and I was making a

1025
00:56:43.811 --> 00:56:47.170
reference to the sirens in their songs.
So that's excellent.

1026
00:56:47.530 --> 00:56:52.500
Do we have any audience questions?
Let's start here.
Cause I,

1027
00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:55.870
I you were my poker opponent and then I'll move across the line.

1028
00:56:55.970 --> 00:57:00.550
<v 3>Oh,
I need a gray zone.
Have you here?
My wife is a big a fan.
Oh,
thank you.</v>

1029
00:57:00.570 --> 00:57:02.830
So I'll come in from China.
I just nod his,

1030
00:57:02.831 --> 00:57:06.730
your career path is a very kind of a interest to team from academia,

1031
00:57:06.731 --> 00:57:10.180
the important player.
Now you change out other causes.

1032
00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:15.280
So what kind of,
uh,
you,
you talk about decision making,
right?
Just for your life,

1033
00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:18.780
based on your life with your parents were kind of bad or big.

1034
00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:21.940
So it was kind of a,
when you make those the season,

1035
00:57:22.570 --> 00:57:26.350
you know what you did,
you know it's a naturally come to that,

1036
00:57:26.380 --> 00:57:31.230
the season or it's a,
sometime you really think about that urinates you know,

1037
00:57:31.390 --> 00:57:35.680
blog sometime and the okay,
I need to change.
So yeah,
that's basically

1038
00:57:36.130 --> 00:57:39.850
<v 2>hi.
So that,
that's an interesting question.
So yeah,</v>

1039
00:57:39.851 --> 00:57:44.851
I mean I have taken a lot of turns and I actually think that my life is a good

1040
00:57:45.370 --> 00:57:49.600
example of I really understanding kind of,
you know,

1041
00:57:49.601 --> 00:57:51.520
this luck versus decision quality.

1042
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:56.910
So I would say that the two big career careers that I've had have come out of

1043
00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:02.640
some,
something happens.

1044
00:58:02.641 --> 00:58:05.350
It's either sort of on the face of it looks lucky or unlucky,

1045
00:58:05.351 --> 00:58:08.230
but it's definitely an intervention of love.
And then I just say,
okay,

1046
00:58:08.231 --> 00:58:13.000
here I am now let me think about what,
what,
where I'm going to go from here.

1047
00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:16.000
So it's not sort of sitting and wallowing in the,
in the,

1048
00:58:16.001 --> 00:58:19.840
in the sort of luck element of it,
but just thinking,
okay,
I'm here now,
so now,

1049
00:58:20.010 --> 00:58:23.410
all right,
that's done.
I've got to sort of figure out where to go from here.

1050
00:58:23.410 --> 00:58:27.220
So the first one would be this illness Atlanta,
me in the hospital for two weeks.

1051
00:58:27.660 --> 00:58:31.190
I still sometimes struggle with it,
but you know,
I've got,
it's an,

1052
00:58:31.340 --> 00:58:34.420
it was very out of control at that time and now I've got it under control so it

1053
00:58:34.421 --> 00:58:36.460
doesn't intervene in my life in the same way anymore.

1054
00:58:36.850 --> 00:58:39.610
But this was when I was really struggling with the stomach issue.

1055
00:58:39.790 --> 00:58:41.650
I land in the hospital for two weeks.

1056
00:58:41.830 --> 00:58:45.550
This seems like an incredibly unlucky thing that's happened to me.
And I say,

1057
00:58:45.551 --> 00:58:49.900
okay,
I need money.
What am I going to do?
I don't have my fellowship anymore.

1058
00:58:49.930 --> 00:58:53.590
It turns out that when you leave graduate school and take time off the NSF,

1059
00:58:54.190 --> 00:58:58.000
the National Science Foundation doesn't still give you money.
So all right,

1060
00:58:58.270 --> 00:58:59.560
I got to figure out what I'm going to do.

1061
00:58:59.561 --> 00:59:01.120
And that's when I started playing poker.

1062
00:59:01.420 --> 00:59:03.550
And then when I was playing poker I discovered okay,

1063
00:59:03.551 --> 00:59:05.500
like I'm pretty good at it and I really enjoy it.

1064
00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:10.500
And it seemed like this really cool like collision of what I was studying.

1065
00:59:12.341 --> 00:59:17.170
And academics and sort of real life.
Right?
And so,
and,
and at that point I said,

1066
00:59:17.171 --> 00:59:20.110
okay,
I'm just going to delay graduate school and this is what I did.

1067
00:59:20.380 --> 00:59:21.500
Once I started poker,

1068
00:59:21.501 --> 00:59:23.900
I didn't necessarily think there was something else I was going to do.

1069
00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:29.240
Then I got asked to give this talk in 2002 it was great and I still didn't
think,

1070
00:59:29.241 --> 00:59:31.960
and that was a matter of luck because Eric Sydell actually ask God,

1071
00:59:31.970 --> 00:59:35.420
ask the good the give the talk,
not me.
And he hates public speaking.

1072
00:59:35.421 --> 00:59:39.080
So he referred me.
This had nothing to do with me.
I wasn't seeking it out.
Right?

1073
00:59:39.081 --> 00:59:43.940
This was not a decision I made.
I get offered the talk.
I say yes,
I give it.

1074
00:59:43.941 --> 00:59:46.610
And I'm still thinking,
oh,
that was fun.
Except that the person,

1075
00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:48.860
the people that I give the talk to started referring me out.

1076
00:59:48.860 --> 00:59:51.890
At which point I said,
okay,
now I've got a choice.
Like I've got a choice.
I could,

1077
00:59:51.891 --> 00:59:56.600
maybe I could do this as well,
which I did.
So,
and there's been all sorts of,

1078
00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:57.890
there's other points in my life.

1079
00:59:57.891 --> 01:00:00.950
I almost became an options trader a little while after that.

1080
01:00:00.951 --> 01:00:03.920
But then poker got on TV and I thought that's kind of interesting.

1081
01:00:03.921 --> 01:00:04.760
Maybe I'll try that.

1082
01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:10.120
And I think that because I think probabilistically I end up,

1083
01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:14.330
I'm just less likely to stick with the status quo.
I'm more likely to say,
okay,

1084
01:00:14.331 --> 01:00:18.020
it's a new decision.
Do I want to switch grocery lines?
Um,

1085
01:00:18.170 --> 01:00:22.910
and so I think that's sort of how I end up looking like I'm kind of here or here

1086
01:00:22.911 --> 01:00:24.710
or here.
It's just okay,

1087
01:00:24.711 --> 01:00:28.850
luck brings you to certain places and I'm perfectly fine saying here's the

1088
01:00:28.851 --> 01:00:31.670
status quo and here's this new thing that I can do.
What can I do?

1089
01:00:31.671 --> 01:00:33.260
Or maybe I can do them both at the same time.

1090
01:00:33.261 --> 01:00:37.250
I think I tend to be more open minded maybe to that because that's the thing

1091
01:00:37.251 --> 01:00:40.700
that poker really teaches you.
It's like the best laid plans,
right?

1092
01:00:40.701 --> 01:00:45.650
You still lose the hand and so it forces you to think probabilistically you have

1093
01:00:45.651 --> 01:00:48.050
to be thinking this way or you will not succeed.

1094
01:00:48.290 --> 01:00:50.570
And I think naturally it spreads out here.

1095
01:00:50.571 --> 01:00:53.780
Here is the actual funniest example that I can give you of how poker players

1096
01:00:53.781 --> 01:00:58.030
just really think this way.
Um,
so,
uh,

1097
01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:04.730
when I went to go on my first date with the absolute love of my life,
uh,

1098
01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:07.850
my brother and brother in law who both knew the person that was going on the

1099
01:01:07.851 --> 01:01:11.270
first date with immediately set a market.
So,

1100
01:01:12.430 --> 01:01:14.540
so they started bidding.
We'd never been on a date.

1101
01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:18.350
We had been friends for a long time,
but we've never been on a date.
So they,

1102
01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:22.130
they start bidding.
And my brother in law ended up buying 23,

1103
01:01:22.730 --> 01:01:26.720
so somebody said to me,
aren't you offended that they started making a market?

1104
01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:31.580
And I was like,
no,
I just,
I just can't believe my brother in law bought 23,

1105
01:01:31.581 --> 01:01:35.150
like we'd never been on a date.
So I think that that shows you,

1106
01:01:35.151 --> 01:01:38.210
it's like just this way of thinking about the world,
just sort of a,
you know,

1107
01:01:38.211 --> 01:01:42.650
attaching numbers to it.
And,
um,
and that's why I think that I sort of,

1108
01:01:42.770 --> 01:01:46.780
<v 0>you know,
I hope that answers your question.
Our next question is online.
Okay.
Um,</v>

1109
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.170
you've talked about the feeling like an imposter or outsider,
some poker tables.

1110
01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:55.070
What are some of the ways the ideas in your book can help address the imposture

1111
01:01:55.071 --> 01:01:58.880
syndrome sensation or counteract overconfidence?
Yeah,

1112
01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:01.430
<v 2>yeah,
that's,
that's actually really good.</v>

1113
01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:05.930
So I think the overconfidence piece is a little bit easier to deal with because

1114
01:02:05.931 --> 01:02:07.610
I think that if you have a really good decision group,

1115
01:02:07.611 --> 01:02:10.280
they're going to check your overconfidence.
Um,

1116
01:02:10.550 --> 01:02:14.210
so that's going to be part of the conversation all the time.
Is,
is,

1117
01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:18.770
are you feeling overconfident?
Um,
imposter syndrome,
you know,
it's,

1118
01:02:18.771 --> 01:02:22.740
it's a hard one.
I mean,
I feel it all the time.
I,
I feel it about this book.

1119
01:02:22.741 --> 01:02:26.040
I feel it when I get up and give talks.
It's like,
oh,
well,
you know,

1120
01:02:26.070 --> 01:02:29.730
why am I even opening my mouth?
Um,
and I,

1121
01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:34.470
I think that again,
it's like get other people to talk to you,

1122
01:02:34.770 --> 01:02:38.850
you know,
because what they can do is they can often see things more clearly.

1123
01:02:38.851 --> 01:02:42.780
So I've actually had conversations where I said,
you know,
oh,

1124
01:02:42.781 --> 01:02:45.690
I just feel like I can't believe it.
I'm such an imposter.

1125
01:02:45.691 --> 01:02:48.540
I don't know what I'm talking about.
Data.
And people will say like,

1126
01:02:48.810 --> 01:02:52.080
people keep hiring you for speeches.
They'll actually go through it like,

1127
01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:55.320
you know,
they refer you out,
people are buying your book.
They're obviously,

1128
01:02:55.321 --> 01:02:55.950
you know,

1129
01:02:55.950 --> 01:02:59.940
and having other people to kind of look at you in a more objective way to get

1130
01:02:59.941 --> 01:03:03.360
you out of your own head.
I think I really feel like that's the way to do it.

1131
01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:05.400
And then what happens is it's like,

1132
01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:09.060
I highly recommend everybody read the power of habit because it really shows you

1133
01:03:09.061 --> 01:03:10.860
how to change your habits,
but not just,

1134
01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:12.810
not just the habits of like going to the gym,

1135
01:03:12.811 --> 01:03:16.860
like your habits of mind and the way you think.
And what ends up is,
you know,

1136
01:03:16.861 --> 01:03:19.770
remember I said when I had that conversation with Eric Sydell,

1137
01:03:19.950 --> 01:03:21.570
now when I went to the table,

1138
01:03:21.810 --> 01:03:24.210
I was thinking about what Eric Sydell might say later.

1139
01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:28.440
And so when you have a really good decision group that's checking your bias,

1140
01:03:28.441 --> 01:03:31.980
whether it's over confidence or under confidence or imposter syndrome,

1141
01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:34.080
the group gets in your head and a really good way.

1142
01:03:34.081 --> 01:03:36.990
So that then when I'm sort of on my own and I'm like,
trust me,

1143
01:03:36.991 --> 01:03:38.760
when I leave this room and I'm in the car,

1144
01:03:38.790 --> 01:03:43.590
I'm going to think about what a bad talk I gave.
So maybe I did,
I don't know.

1145
01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:49.770
I just,
so now I'm in my head.
Um,
okay.
So anyway,
uh,

1146
01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:51.510
when I do that,

1147
01:03:51.630 --> 01:03:56.130
hopefully I have a group of people that I can sort of offload that to and they

1148
01:03:56.131 --> 01:03:58.980
can offload things like that to me.
And hopefully they're talking to me.

1149
01:03:59.130 --> 01:04:03.930
I mean not physically,
but the,
I'm sort of running that conversation,
you know,

1150
01:04:03.931 --> 01:04:06.510
cause that's really what happened at the poker table was if I,

1151
01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:09.990
if I was processing the world and like a way that was irrational,

1152
01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:14.230
I would run the conversation with Eric or my brother or John Hennigan or whoever

1153
01:04:14.231 --> 01:04:17.760
it might be later where they were telling me like,
oh,
come on.
Um,

1154
01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:20.490
and that would help me when I was kind of on my own.

1155
01:04:20.790 --> 01:04:22.540
So I think it's about how are you,
how,

1156
01:04:23.010 --> 01:04:26.160
what are the rewards are getting and how are people around you helping to sort

1157
01:04:26.161 --> 01:04:29.640
of shape,
you know,
those,
those habits of mind.

1158
01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:31.080
And I think that's really the best way.

1159
01:04:31.081 --> 01:04:34.080
Cause I think it's just the thing is I think it's so hard to do on your own.

1160
01:04:34.081 --> 01:04:36.960
I just think,
I think we all really need help with this.
You know,

1161
01:04:36.961 --> 01:04:40.260
and I think another,
another mistake we make is we think,
well,
if I know about it,

1162
01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:43.770
like if I know about imposter syndrome or I know about overconfidence and I'm

1163
01:04:43.771 --> 01:04:48.250
really smart,
problem solved
in the book.

1164
01:04:48.251 --> 01:04:50.670
Didn't you mentioned that the people who have the highest Iq scores are the ones

1165
01:04:50.671 --> 01:04:54.570
you're most susceptible to.
Yeah.
So,
uh,
being uh,

1166
01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:59.540
actually being high Iq correlates positively with motivated reasoning.
So,
uh,

1167
01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:02.940
it,
right.
And you can think why that is,
right?

1168
01:05:02.941 --> 01:05:07.050
It's like how do you slice and dice the info?
Like if you're cognitively agile,

1169
01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:09.030
you're going to be able to slice and dice the story.

1170
01:05:09.031 --> 01:05:14.031
That sounds a lot more convincing to yourself and to others about why everything

1171
01:05:14.341 --> 01:05:19.180
you believe is true and why every prediction you'll have is 100%.
Um,

1172
01:05:19.270 --> 01:05:20.081
so yeah,

1173
01:05:20.081 --> 01:05:25.081
so I'm smart and I know about this now is not necessarily a solution.

1174
01:05:25.511 --> 01:05:28.360
And like I say,
like I,
I'm telling you,
I'm going to walk away from this.

1175
01:05:28.361 --> 01:05:30.250
I'm going to think about what a bad job I did.
I'm not,

1176
01:05:30.430 --> 01:05:33.190
I don't want you guys to think that like you,
you,

1177
01:05:33.370 --> 01:05:37.570
you practice these things and somehow it's ever solved.
It's not,

1178
01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:42.130
it's just do I catch myself doing it more often?
Do I do it less?

1179
01:05:42.670 --> 01:05:46.520
And those,
just doing it less and catching it more often is,

1180
01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:47.950
it's huge.

1181
01:05:48.550 --> 01:05:52.240
So instead of like berating yourself for all the times that you screw up,

1182
01:05:52.270 --> 01:05:56.410
it's like you get to celebrate that I did at one fewer times.
You know,
like it's,

1183
01:05:56.411 --> 01:05:59.680
it's such a more self compassionate way to live.
Like,
and I'm really like,

1184
01:05:59.681 --> 01:06:03.460
I'm trying to get there,
but you know.
Yeah.
So I think you had a question.
Yeah.

1185
01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:09.630
Oh,
sorry.
What are we supposed to end up?
Sorry,
I didn't want to keep going.

1186
01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:14.140
We're okay.
Yeah.
Okay,
sure.
Question.
What's your strategy for Rock,
paper scissors?

1187
01:06:14.350 --> 01:06:19.320
Oh,
Short,
short answer is throw scissors.
Um,

1188
01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:23.230
so just kind of understand.
So most people throw rock first.
Um,

1189
01:06:23.231 --> 01:06:27.900
and then most people kind of know you throw a rock.
So,
um,
so,
uh,

1190
01:06:28.090 --> 01:06:28.930
what happens is,
well,

1191
01:06:28.931 --> 01:06:32.560
it depends if you're against somebody who is a total newbie,

1192
01:06:32.890 --> 01:06:36.850
so you know they're gonna Throw Rock,
um,
uh,
then you should,
you know,

1193
01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:38.680
just throw paper.
But,

1194
01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:41.560
but if you're against somebody who you think is a little bit smarter than that,

1195
01:06:41.561 --> 01:06:42.640
they're going to throw a paper on you.

1196
01:06:42.641 --> 01:06:46.480
So you do a pretty good job throwing scissors.
And if they're really good,

1197
01:06:46.481 --> 01:06:48.760
they throw scissors,
a new tie.
So it's not a big deal.

1198
01:06:49.850 --> 01:06:51.950
<v 4>Oh,
one of the things that you said at the beginning of the talk,</v>

1199
01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:53.800
like really stuck with me about like,
uh,

1200
01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:58.820
talking about your opinions and in terms of bets and challenging that,

1201
01:06:59.090 --> 01:07:02.330
how'd you do that when something isn't quite as quantifiable as like the number

1202
01:07:02.331 --> 01:07:04.010
of representatives in the house in November?

1203
01:07:04.350 --> 01:07:08.780
<v 2>Sure.
So everything can be quantified.
The chances that you,</v>

1204
01:07:09.070 --> 01:07:10.700
because every,
everything is probabilistic.

1205
01:07:10.701 --> 01:07:14.150
Like the chances that you meet the love of your life tomorrow or that the person

1206
01:07:14.151 --> 01:07:16.100
that you stay with,
you'll still be within 10 years.

1207
01:07:16.130 --> 01:07:19.610
Or whether you're going to like the dish that you order at a restaurant or

1208
01:07:19.850 --> 01:07:23.510
literally,
you know,
literally everything is quantifiable.
Now,

1209
01:07:23.990 --> 01:07:28.990
do we have enough data to get to a flipping heads or tails where we know,

1210
01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:34.100
we know 50% of the time that you're gonna flip heads?
No,

1211
01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:39.530
I,
is there some objective probability for anything?
Sure.
Do we have access to it?

1212
01:07:39.531 --> 01:07:43.550
Absolutely not.
But we can sort of come up with a range now.

1213
01:07:43.580 --> 01:07:46.940
So what people will say to me is often,
well,
it's not really quantifiable.
Well,

1214
01:07:46.941 --> 01:07:50.780
of course it is.
It's just that it's harder.
There's more unknown information.

1215
01:07:50.781 --> 01:07:55.310
It's harder to get to.
We don't have as much data.
So what I tell them is,
look,

1216
01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:59.030
let's say that I were to ask you some question about,
well,

1217
01:07:59.031 --> 01:08:03.760
what do you think the chances are that this belief that you have is true?
Um,

1218
01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:07.700
and the best you could do is somewhere between 20 and 80%.
Right?

1219
01:08:07.701 --> 01:08:10.010
That's a really wide market.
But you know what?

1220
01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:13.700
It's not as wide as zero to a hundred.
Like at least you're trying.

1221
01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:16.700
That's the thing.
Even if you say,
I don't know,

1222
01:08:16.701 --> 01:08:20.660
I can narrow it down to between 20 and 80%,
that's not a failure.

1223
01:08:20.661 --> 01:08:23.090
That's a success because you're trying,

1224
01:08:23.091 --> 01:08:28.010
and then what that does is because you've,
you,
you say,
well,
okay,
it's 28,

1225
01:08:28.011 --> 01:08:30.440
80%,
man,
I'd really like to try to refine that.

1226
01:08:30.990 --> 01:08:33.830
You'll now start to go ask people like,

1227
01:08:33.831 --> 01:08:36.090
you're going to go start asking for information.
You're,

1228
01:08:36.230 --> 01:08:38.180
whereas if you just sort of leave it as like whatever,

1229
01:08:38.181 --> 01:08:40.160
you don't actually ever tried to get better at it.

1230
01:08:40.370 --> 01:08:43.910
So now maybe you go and you start researching and you w,
you know what,

1231
01:08:43.911 --> 01:08:46.850
I make a joke and it literally every single talk that I give,
I say,

1232
01:08:46.851 --> 01:08:49.460
what this does for you that makes you take out and look at Google,

1233
01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:50.990
you guys will be very having to it.

1234
01:08:50.991 --> 01:08:53.570
But literally it's a joke in every time in every talk that I give,

1235
01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:57.440
it makes me want to Google things.
Um,
so,
but it makes me want to Google things.

1236
01:08:57.650 --> 01:09:01.760
So,
so now you start googling and maybe you,
you say,
okay,
now I'm there down,

1237
01:09:01.761 --> 01:09:04.460
it's between 72% and,
right.

1238
01:09:04.461 --> 01:09:09.170
So like that's what happens.
You know,
now it's 70 to 28.
Um,

1239
01:09:09.350 --> 01:09:12.410
so,
and now you're a little bit narrower than,
than 80,
20,

1240
01:09:12.411 --> 01:09:14.330
and that's all we're trying to do.

1241
01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:16.940
But if we don't think about things probabilistically,

1242
01:09:16.941 --> 01:09:21.170
if we don't recognize that what's going to happen in the future is

1243
01:09:21.171 --> 01:09:24.890
probabilistic,
that we can't guarantee it.
We are not playing chess.

1244
01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:29.570
If I play better than you,
it does not mean I win.
Not In life,
only in chess,

1245
01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:31.970
right?
That if we don't do that,

1246
01:09:31.971 --> 01:09:34.430
then we're going to be really surprised when a bad outcome happens.

1247
01:09:34.431 --> 01:09:36.470
We're going to overreact to it.
We're,

1248
01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:38.930
we're going to start changing strategy when we shouldn't.

1249
01:09:39.170 --> 01:09:41.780
We're going to reinforce strategies that we shouldn't.

1250
01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:46.190
We're going to always be reacting instead of planning ahead instead of being

1251
01:09:46.191 --> 01:09:49.460
proactive because we're not understanding that well,

1252
01:09:49.461 --> 01:09:53.120
other things would happen then the thing that we think,
you know,

1253
01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:56.350
so I think just try,
just try like,
cause every,

1254
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:59.040
literally everything is quantifiable.
Um,

1255
01:10:00.110 --> 01:10:03.860
where were you at on Black Friday in 2011.

1256
01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:08.570
And what are your thoughts on regulating online poker?
Oh,
okay.

1257
01:10:08.571 --> 01:10:11.360
That's an interesting question.
So where I was at,
I remember this,

1258
01:10:11.361 --> 01:10:14.030
I was in my bedroom,
uh,
and I got a call.

1259
01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:17.870
You should open up the internet and you should look.
Um,

1260
01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:21.620
so black Friday is the DOJ came in down and shut down all of online poker.

1261
01:10:21.621 --> 01:10:24.990
It was a very bad day for poker.
Everybody was really mad.
It was,

1262
01:10:25.060 --> 01:10:27.560
it was really hard.
Like in a lot of ways,

1263
01:10:27.561 --> 01:10:29.720
the poker community hasn't recovered from it.

1264
01:10:30.050 --> 01:10:34.610
So it was kind of interesting because,
uh,
I played in the 90s when,
uh,
in poker,

1265
01:10:34.611 --> 01:10:39.080
money was not raining down from the sky.
Um,
uh,
you know,

1266
01:10:39.081 --> 01:10:42.420
there was a very small group of people who were playing and they need sometimes

1267
01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:46.430
have,
you know,
someone who came in and would play and you know,
you were,

1268
01:10:46.431 --> 01:10:47.750
it was really like you were,

1269
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:52.070
it was called grinding and then online poker happened with the collision of

1270
01:10:52.071 --> 01:10:56.000
poker on TV and the poker economy just boomed.
I mean,

1271
01:10:56.060 --> 01:10:57.280
I mean boomed.

1272
01:10:57.890 --> 01:11:02.210
It was really like just money raining down from the sky and then the DOJ on

1273
01:11:02.211 --> 01:11:06.800
black Friday,
now it all contracts and that was really hard.

1274
01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:10.490
I think it was less hard for the people who had been playing in the 90s,

1275
01:11:10.491 --> 01:11:14.670
because I think we sort of saw the luck in what had happened during the two

1276
01:11:14.671 --> 01:11:16.710
thousands a little bit more.
Um,

1277
01:11:16.890 --> 01:11:20.970
but it's like whenever anything goes through like a big recession and I would

1278
01:11:20.971 --> 01:11:25.590
call it a depression.
It's painful,
right?
Like it's super,
super,
super,

1279
01:11:25.591 --> 01:11:28.380
super painful.
Um,
you know,
in,

1280
01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:32.850
in terms of whether there should be regulation,
um,
you know,

1281
01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:35.550
I'm somewhat small government,
but I'm also,
you know,

1282
01:11:35.551 --> 01:11:37.140
I like people to have protections.

1283
01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:42.450
So I did testify in front of Congress twice about regulation and um,
um,

1284
01:11:42.510 --> 01:11:47.510
I tend to be more on the sort of free for your side of that discussion.

1285
01:11:48.150 --> 01:11:52.080
Um,
you know that you should let adults choose what they want to do and then

1286
01:11:52.081 --> 01:11:54.700
obviously make sure that there isn't fraud occurring.
Right.
So you,

1287
01:11:54.701 --> 01:11:58.830
so you should always have protections against fraud.
Excellent.

1288
01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:04.240
<v 5>What resonated with me?
You Christina,
status quo.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think it's uh,</v>

1289
01:12:04.490 --> 01:12:07.430
it's great because it gives you a lot of opportunity to see your options in life

1290
01:12:07.431 --> 01:12:10.670
all the time instead of just going with what you have.
But also I have,

1291
01:12:10.671 --> 01:12:12.770
the feeling is a,
it's a risky business.
You know,

1292
01:12:12.771 --> 01:12:17.771
you can like invest a lot of time and always questioning your set of school and

1293
01:12:18.231 --> 01:12:21.080
instead of focusing on what you're doing and like trusting your decisions you

1294
01:12:21.081 --> 01:12:24.770
made in the past and like,
how do you find the balance,
you know,

1295
01:12:24.790 --> 01:12:28.640
and you seem to have been going good places of it.
So do you set your set of,

1296
01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:29.690
you know,
mine stores,
Oh,

1297
01:12:29.691 --> 01:12:32.510
I'm questioning where I'm at in life next month from now?

1298
01:12:32.511 --> 01:12:35.930
Or do you like two minutes later when you're on the wrong line?
I mean,
you know,

1299
01:12:35.931 --> 01:12:38.290
how much time do you invest in that bed too?

1300
01:12:38.580 --> 01:12:41.940
<v 2>I think there's a couple of things.
I think certainly from a business standpoint,</v>

1301
01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:43.280
we always go,
you know,

1302
01:12:43.290 --> 01:12:46.950
there's always strategic planning sessions and I think that when we do that,

1303
01:12:47.010 --> 01:12:48.120
it's always around like,

1304
01:12:48.121 --> 01:12:50.850
what's the new decision and what doesn't get included in there as well?

1305
01:12:50.851 --> 01:12:54.950
What about sticking with what we're doing?
Um,
so I think that we tend to,
uh,

1306
01:12:55.140 --> 01:12:58.140
get involved in strategic planning decisions generally when there's something

1307
01:12:58.141 --> 01:13:01.560
wrong and you should actually set a calendar for,
all right,
let's,

1308
01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:05.910
let's start thinking about what are our goals regardless of whether we think

1309
01:13:05.911 --> 01:13:10.360
something is wrong,
because maybe there's a better way to do it.
Um,
uh,
and,

1310
01:13:10.530 --> 01:13:11.890
and actually working backwards is,

1311
01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:15.030
so something called backcasting and premortems is the best way to do that.

1312
01:13:15.031 --> 01:13:18.990
So imagine what your goal is.
Think about that.
You've actually reached it.

1313
01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:21.510
This is a backcast.
And then think about how you got to the,

1314
01:13:21.690 --> 01:13:24.490
how you actually did it.
So it's three years from now and you know,

1315
01:13:24.510 --> 01:13:26.700
we accomplished x,
how did we do that?

1316
01:13:26.701 --> 01:13:31.110
But then also a premortem is it's three years from now and we failed.
You know,

1317
01:13:31.111 --> 01:13:32.730
how did that happen?
Um,

1318
01:13:32.731 --> 01:13:36.270
and I think that allows you to see the landscape a little bit better.
Um,

1319
01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:38.610
what I would say in terms of,
you know,

1320
01:13:38.611 --> 01:13:41.760
are you doing it too much or are you doing it too little?
Um,

1321
01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:45.960
there,
there's two things that I want to say about that.

1322
01:13:45.961 --> 01:13:48.690
One is that I certainly don't think that every decision that you're ever

1323
01:13:48.691 --> 01:13:50.070
supposed to be make is,
Eh,

1324
01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:53.250
is supposed to be done as a deliberative process if you did that,

1325
01:13:53.251 --> 01:13:56.150
I wouldn't be able to get from here to there.
Right?
So,
uh,

1326
01:13:56.310 --> 01:13:59.160
a lot of stuff that's happening is certainly more gut and it's more in the

1327
01:13:59.161 --> 01:14:03.180
moment.
And I think that that's totally fine as long as you hold your intuition

1328
01:14:03.181 --> 01:14:05.280
accountable to a deliberative process at some point.

1329
01:14:05.670 --> 01:14:10.500
So when somebody says to you,
well why did you do what you did?
Uh,

1330
01:14:10.501 --> 01:14:15.100
your answer never be because my gut told me to.
And then when they say,
okay,

1331
01:14:15.101 --> 01:14:16.270
that's great,
but why?

1332
01:14:16.330 --> 01:14:19.090
It shouldn't be because I told you because my gut told me to.

1333
01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:22.120
If you can't teach it to another PR person,
there was a problem.

1334
01:14:22.121 --> 01:14:23.560
So that being said,

1335
01:14:23.561 --> 01:14:27.070
I think intuition can be very good as long as you're checking it occasionally.

1336
01:14:27.370 --> 01:14:31.090
Um,
but in terms of whether you should have a schedule,

1337
01:14:31.270 --> 01:14:35.260
I think once you start thinking about the world more probabilistic,
Lee,

1338
01:14:35.470 --> 01:14:39.700
you're naturally examining those things and it's happening relatively

1339
01:14:39.701 --> 01:14:43.000
automatically and you do end up sticking with the status quo a lot.

1340
01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:46.840
It's just that you're sort of seeing these opportunities over on the side more.

1341
01:14:47.230 --> 01:14:49.180
Now,
what's interesting is that when you do that,

1342
01:14:49.181 --> 01:14:52.030
you don't just overreact and like just because things aren't going well right

1343
01:14:52.031 --> 01:14:52.850
now,

1344
01:14:52.850 --> 01:14:57.850
you're actually less likely I think to change course because I think that a lot

1345
01:14:58.151 --> 01:15:02.380
of our changing courses,
a reaction to the way that the status quo is,

1346
01:15:02.410 --> 01:15:07.410
is now it's a reaction to having a bad outcome and a lot of not changing courses

1347
01:15:07.511 --> 01:15:09.040
that we just happened to have good outcomes.

1348
01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:12.400
So I think that what happens is that when you start thinking in this way more

1349
01:15:12.401 --> 01:15:15.670
probabilistically,
even if you have good outcomes,
you are,

1350
01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:18.580
you're always sort of working with your decision group of like,
well,

1351
01:15:18.581 --> 01:15:20.920
is there a better way?
That doesn't necessarily mean you do it,

1352
01:15:20.921 --> 01:15:23.740
it just means it's,
it's in your head so that you're,

1353
01:15:23.770 --> 01:15:26.650
you're more likely to sort of see the opportunity when it comes your way.

1354
01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:31.240
But what's more important is you're less likely to overreact to a bad outcome

1355
01:15:31.241 --> 01:15:33.760
happening where you actually change course too much.

1356
01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:36.910
And I would actually say that interestingly enough that that second problem is

1357
01:15:36.911 --> 01:15:39.430
what the big problem,
the bigger problem is.

1358
01:15:40.210 --> 01:15:43.270
It's not so much that if you think this way,
you're,

1359
01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:45.610
you're going to be going left,
right,
left,
right,
left,
right.

1360
01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.960
It's that you're not going to be just going left because bad things are

1361
01:15:49.961 --> 01:15:50.860
happening all the time.

1362
01:15:50.861 --> 01:15:53.950
You're going to be setting back into a more deliberative place on those things.

1363
01:15:53.951 --> 01:15:57.640
It's actually going to either cause you to make sort of incremental changes that

1364
01:15:57.641 --> 01:15:58.510
are going to be really good.

1365
01:15:58.511 --> 01:16:02.170
It's going to cause you to be able to anticipate or think about paradigm shifts

1366
01:16:02.171 --> 01:16:05.290
for yourself a little bit better and I think it's going to actually give you a

1367
01:16:05.291 --> 01:16:06.940
smoother ride,
much,

1368
01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:11.050
much more so than a less smooth ride and I don't know.
Not See now.

1369
01:16:11.051 --> 01:16:12.250
Now you might go and say,
no,

1370
01:16:12.251 --> 01:16:16.110
she should actually get into that limo and how to do that.

1371
01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:17.440
Does that answer your question

1372
01:16:19.180 --> 01:16:21.340
<v 6>on the other
side?</v>

1373
01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:26.900
<v 2>Yeah.
No,
I'm for,
I'm all for status quo.
Yeah.</v>

1374
01:16:27.070 --> 01:16:28.860
<v 6>Do you see the,
you see the success and you wanted,</v>

1375
01:16:28.861 --> 01:16:30.660
they always question it was just as you've met yesterday.

1376
01:16:31.390 --> 01:16:34.210
<v 2>Well,
yeah,
so I think it's like again,
it has to do,
right?</v>

1377
01:16:34.211 --> 01:16:36.970
It has to do with separating those,
those that don't Pat Yourself.

1378
01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:40.990
I sort of say don't get so down on yourself for your bad outcomes and don't pat

1379
01:16:40.991 --> 01:16:42.880
yourself on the back so hard for your good ones.

1380
01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:48.070
So like here's a really great way actually the to implement within your own
life.

1381
01:16:48.071 --> 01:16:51.160
It's like once a week have a team,
your team get together.

1382
01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:54.760
Think of each person presents like the best success that they had that week.

1383
01:16:54.761 --> 01:16:58.000
And everybody talks about like they have to offer up the five things that they

1384
01:16:58.001 --> 01:17:02.920
did wrong along the way to that success.
So it's not about changing course,

1385
01:17:02.921 --> 01:17:05.410
right?
It's about,
it's more about refining,

1386
01:17:05.411 --> 01:17:07.870
about always trying to do a little bit better.

1387
01:17:08.230 --> 01:17:10.280
And I think that when you have that goal in mind,

1388
01:17:10.281 --> 01:17:14.150
I think you do a lot better cause otherwise it's what makes us make these big

1389
01:17:14.151 --> 01:17:18.380
left turns.
I mean,
I mean I've got a couple in my life,
but um,
you know,

1390
01:17:18.590 --> 01:17:20.210
what makes us make these big left turns,

1391
01:17:20.211 --> 01:17:23.300
I think is when we're reacting to the way that things are,
we're just reacting.

1392
01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:28.760
So when you're trying to separate these two things at and always be trying to

1393
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:30.170
focus on process,

1394
01:17:31.370 --> 01:17:35.810
now what happens is you're less likely to be making these like 90 degree
changes,

1395
01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:36.673
I think.

1396
01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:38.840
<v 0>Oh,
I have an online question.
Okay.</v>

1397
01:17:39.050 --> 01:17:42.590
What is your approach to the mental game of poker when running bad,

1398
01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:46.160
when our emotions can potentially influence our thought process?

1399
01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:50.330
Can you compare that to the advice offered by Jared Tinder and his popular

1400
01:17:50.331 --> 01:17:53.220
mental games?
Mental game of poker books?
Yeah.

1401
01:17:53.530 --> 01:17:56.590
<v 2>Okay.
So I haven't read those books,
so I can't make the comparison,</v>

1402
01:17:56.950 --> 01:18:00.880
but I can answer the first part of the question.
Um,
okay.

1403
01:18:00.881 --> 01:18:05.710
So there's something in poker called tilt.
Tilt is when our emotions,

1404
01:18:05.770 --> 01:18:07.330
um,
get lit up.

1405
01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:12.200
That shuts our frontal cortex prefrontal cortex down.
And,
uh,

1406
01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:15.860
we start making really bad decisions.
Um,
so I,

1407
01:18:15.930 --> 01:18:19.620
I say about poker has this really interesting quality of,
uh,

1408
01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:23.680
you're exchanging chips.
Oh,
you know,
every single hand.

1409
01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:28.740
And so it's letting you see that there's a risk in every single decision.

1410
01:18:28.931 --> 01:18:29.800
So that's the good thing.

1411
01:18:30.460 --> 01:18:35.380
The bad thing is it's allowing you to get caught in the path.
Right?
So,

1412
01:18:35.410 --> 01:18:36.490
um,
if you think about it,

1413
01:18:36.491 --> 01:18:39.550
I mean obviously what we'd really like is to think of ourselves as like the burr

1414
01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:41.290
a Berkshire Hathaway stock,
right?
We want,

1415
01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:46.360
we want a general upward trend to our happiness stock over our lifetime.

1416
01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:50.800
Um,
and if you look at birth or hack Berkshire Hathaway from the moment of its

1417
01:18:50.801 --> 01:18:51.341
inception,

1418
01:18:51.341 --> 01:18:54.490
it has that general leopard twin and it looks like a pretty nice little ride.

1419
01:18:54.940 --> 01:18:57.940
But if you look at it on a given day,
it might have a sharp downturn.

1420
01:18:58.110 --> 01:19:01.780
And in poker,
because you've got this exchange happening all the time,

1421
01:19:01.781 --> 01:19:05.380
you end up doing what's called ticker watching and you can really see those down

1422
01:19:05.381 --> 01:19:07.720
swings and you can really feel those upswings.

1423
01:19:07.721 --> 01:19:12.460
And so you start getting yanked around in this kind of like path dependent.
Um,

1424
01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:16.990
uh,
you know,
you're very path dependent in terms of where your emotions are.
So,

1425
01:19:16.991 --> 01:19:20.740
and this is generally a problem in life,
right?
So as an example,

1426
01:19:20.741 --> 01:19:25.090
like let's say that you're on the side of the road and you have a flat tire and

1427
01:19:25.091 --> 01:19:27.970
it's raining and it's really cold and you don't have a jack.

1428
01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:31.570
And you called Aaa and you know,
they take forever.
Um,

1429
01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:34.930
and so you're just cursing your life,
right?
Like you're just thinking like,

1430
01:19:35.380 --> 01:19:38.470
I have the unhappiest life.
I can't even imagine it.

1431
01:19:38.630 --> 01:19:41.170
Why do these things always happen to me?
Oh,

1432
01:19:41.530 --> 01:19:44.860
do you think it matters if you got a promotion three days before?
Are you like,

1433
01:19:44.861 --> 01:19:45.641
no,
hold on a second.

1434
01:19:45.641 --> 01:19:50.590
Let me actually take the average of my happiness over the last three days.

1435
01:19:51.190 --> 01:19:54.730
No.
Yeah.
It's like literally what happened three days ago doesn't matter.

1436
01:19:54.731 --> 01:19:57.160
You're only,
you're really deep down in that moment.

1437
01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:01.330
So this actually gives us a clue to how we deal with this and it's part of how

1438
01:20:01.331 --> 01:20:04.270
poker players deal with it.
So if I were to say to you,
okay,

1439
01:20:04.271 --> 01:20:06.220
let's say that you had that flat terror a year ago,

1440
01:20:07.230 --> 01:20:11.040
do you think that that would have affected your happiness one bit over the

1441
01:20:11.041 --> 01:20:15.990
course of the last year?
That one incident?
I actually,
to tell you the truth,

1442
01:20:15.991 --> 01:20:17.730
I actually think it would,
I think it would,
uptick.

1443
01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:20.640
I think it would cause enough ticking your happiness because it's a really good

1444
01:20:20.700 --> 01:20:22.890
cocktail party story.
Um,
uh,

1445
01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:26.820
interesting articles that I've seen a lot of kind of current events and thinking

1446
01:20:26.821 --> 01:20:29.130
about it in terms of um,

1447
01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:33.480
resulting or the hindsight bias or self serving bias or motivated reasoning or

1448
01:20:33.481 --> 01:20:36.090
whatever it might be,
to really kind of look at how,

1449
01:20:36.150 --> 01:20:38.670
what are things that are happening out in the world that can help us to try to

1450
01:20:38.671 --> 01:20:42.180
figure out how to be better decision makers.
So,
um,

1451
01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:44.010
like this week for example,

1452
01:20:44.011 --> 01:20:47.700
I talked a little bit about the NFL draft and decision making around the NFL

1453
01:20:47.701 --> 01:20:49.110
draft.
Um,

1454
01:20:49.170 --> 01:20:53.790
I also talked about a really interesting study that was done on a inducing

1455
01:20:53.791 --> 01:20:56.660
intellectual humility melody in,
uh,

1456
01:20:56.820 --> 01:21:01.590
high school students and how that actually increases their ability to learn,

1457
01:21:01.780 --> 01:21:05.970
um,
to really get that into that sort of mode of,
I'm not sure.
Um,

1458
01:21:05.971 --> 01:21:09.750
so that was in there I talked about as something from near I all on the peak end

1459
01:21:09.751 --> 01:21:13.440
rule and how you can hack that in order to make your memory's better and your

1460
01:21:13.441 --> 01:21:17.520
experiences better or at least your memory of your experiences better.
Um,
uh,

1461
01:21:17.521 --> 01:21:21.210
so that,
you know,
and then I'll also talk about things in that,
you know,

1462
01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:22.470
I not in this particular one,

1463
01:21:22.471 --> 01:21:24.330
but like last week I think I talked about current events,

1464
01:21:24.331 --> 01:21:27.660
things that are happening in politics,
um,
and that kind of thing.

1465
01:21:27.661 --> 01:21:29.940
So hopefully people will subscribe to the newsletter.

1466
01:21:29.941 --> 01:21:33.840
You can actually find archives of the newsletter on Annie duke.com so you don't

1467
01:21:33.841 --> 01:21:36.900
have to buy it until you actually test the product.
So you can,

1468
01:21:37.110 --> 01:21:39.090
you can go see what your podcast,

1469
01:21:41.490 --> 01:21:45.660
you do a great job doing that.
Well,
I appreciate that.
Um,
so I'm not,

1470
01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:47.750
so I've had that suggestion.
I,

1471
01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:50.730
I'm thinking about it right now because of the launch of the book.

1472
01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:53.460
I'm doing a lot of podcasts.
Um,

1473
01:21:53.550 --> 01:21:57.540
and so I'm kind of enjoying that at the moment.
Um,
I've done some really,

1474
01:21:57.541 --> 01:21:59.880
really fun ones.
Um,
and one,

1475
01:21:59.881 --> 01:22:03.120
and actually it's exposed me to a bunch of podcasts that I didn't know about.

1476
01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:05.430
So that's been actually Super Fun,
is that I'm,

1477
01:22:05.431 --> 01:22:08.730
I'm getting to find out about some podcasts that I wasn't personally aware of.

1478
01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:13.140
I love podcasts because I think,
I mean some of them are obviously like,
you know,

1479
01:22:13.141 --> 01:22:17.090
your 15 minute deals,
but,
but the ones that are more like this,
um,

1480
01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:19.410
where you get to go,
you get to do a deep dive.

1481
01:22:19.411 --> 01:22:23.220
And then what I find that's so amazing about them is that I rarely come from

1482
01:22:23.490 --> 01:22:26.820
away from a podcast where I haven't learned something.
I mean,

1483
01:22:26.821 --> 01:22:28.740
I'm always not just one thing either,

1484
01:22:28.741 --> 01:22:33.741
like so much where you get to sit and talk to somebody who's obviously really

1485
01:22:34.621 --> 01:22:39.621
smart and really engaged and see what their perspective on your product is,

1486
01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:41.730
is so cool.

1487
01:22:42.210 --> 01:22:46.920
And it's just like such gratitude for how it,

1488
01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:50.100
it changed.
Like you,
you come in and you're like,
well this is my,

1489
01:22:50.370 --> 01:22:54.690
this is my work product.
And then you come away going,
oh my gosh,
what a cool,

1490
01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:58.700
like I didn't think of that and I was so challenged in that makes me think about

1491
01:22:58.701 --> 01:23:00.090
it in a different way.
And Oh,

1492
01:23:00.091 --> 01:23:02.700
this relates to this in a way that I hadn't thought before.

1493
01:23:02.970 --> 01:23:05.980
So I'm just enjoying that process right now.
And then we'll,
we'll see.
I don't

1494
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:09.040
<v 0>know.
We'll see what the future holds in terms of anything else.
Excellent.
Well,</v>

1495
01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:12.310
if you haven't already,
grab her book.
It's called thinking in bets,

1496
01:23:12.311 --> 01:23:15.070
making smarter decisions when you don't have all the facts.

1497
01:23:15.250 --> 01:23:17.280
If we can give her a please shoot Reynolds

1498
01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:22.760
<v 7>[inaudible].</v>
