1
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,320
Fantastic. Well, um, thank
you Alex for over promising,

2
00:00:10,321 --> 00:00:14,940
I hope to under deliver. Um, and thank
you everybody for being here today.

3
00:00:14,941 --> 00:00:18,390
I'm really excited to be talking to
Google. Um, before I get started,

4
00:00:18,391 --> 00:00:21,850
I just want to gauge where
the audience is. So, um,

5
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,470
if you have a background in physics,

6
00:00:25,471 --> 00:00:28,650
like you've ever taken a course in quantum
mechanics, can you raise your hand?

7
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,140
Okay. So that's like maybe two
thirds, one half to two thirds.

8
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:38,610
It's good if you have no formal training
in physics and you just think that

9
00:00:38,611 --> 00:00:43,140
quantum mechanics is cool or that physics
is interesting. Raise your hand. Okay,

10
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,003
good,
good.

11
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:49,190
So this talk is going to be aimed
primarily or at the level of people who

12
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,600
haven't taken any courses in quantum
mechanics, but at the end, in the Q and a,

13
00:00:54,601 --> 00:00:56,040
we can get as technical as we want.

14
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,040
There's all sorts of stuff that
I'm not mentioning in his talk,

15
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:02,170
which we can get into in the Q and a.

16
00:01:02,171 --> 00:01:05,730
So like if you are annoyed that I
don't mention decoherence for example,

17
00:01:05,731 --> 00:01:09,780
we can talk about it in the Q and. A.
I can explain why I didn't mention it.

18
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,260
So let's talk about quantum physics.
Quantum physics is fantastic,

19
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,380
but there was a problem with it.
There's a hole at the heart of the theory.

20
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,970
And just to be clear, uh,
quantum physics works.

21
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:25,350
It works tremendously well. Uh,
it is by almost any measure,

22
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:29,160
the most successful scientific theory
that humanity has ever devised.

23
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,910
I had explains an enormous
variety of phenomena.

24
00:01:32,911 --> 00:01:36,720
It's the physics of the ultra tiny,
but it goes well beyond that.

25
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:38,720
It explains why the Sunshine's,

26
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,340
it explains why we can
see that the sun shines a,

27
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,770
it is what almost every single piece of
technology in this room or in the world

28
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:48,240
runs on a,

29
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,420
it even explains why you're not sinking
through the chairs that you're sitting

30
00:01:51,421 --> 00:01:55,500
in right now because quantum mechanics
explains why anything is ever solid.

31
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,970
Uh, so it's, it's just a phenomenally
successful theory. And, uh,

32
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:04,350
anybody who says otherwise is, you know,
has no idea what they're talking about.

33
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,420
It is a good theory,

34
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,900
but there is a problem.

35
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:15,110
The problem is that it is just not
clear what quantum physics is telling us

36
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:17,640
about the world around us.

37
00:02:17,641 --> 00:02:21,930
The connection between the theory though
it's phenomenally successful and the

38
00:02:21,931 --> 00:02:25,890
world that we're in is just not obvious.

39
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,690
And to explain what I mean by that,

40
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,370
say that I want to figure out
where this marker is. Right?

41
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,620
So right now if I want to use
Newton's physics, you know the,

42
00:02:36,621 --> 00:02:40,830
the pre quantum classical physics
to figure out where this marker is,

43
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,280
I need three numbers to describe
where it is. I need to say, okay,

44
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:45,720
it's a certain height above the ground,

45
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,800
it's a certain distance in front of me
and it's a certain distance off to my

46
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:50,634
left.

47
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,920
But if I want to say where this
thing is in quantum mechanics,

48
00:02:55,921 --> 00:02:58,860
if I want to describe its position,
I need more than three numbers.

49
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,610
I need an infinity of numbers
scattered across all of space.

50
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,140
And this is known as a wave
function. And this is, you know,

51
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:12,190
somewhat odd that we need an
infinity of numbers. But you know,

52
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,780
oddness is fine. The trouble with quantum
mechanics isn't that it's strange.

53
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:20,980
Strangeness Is Okay, the
World is a strange place. If
our theories weren't weird,

54
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,750
they wouldn't be able to
account for what we see. Uh,

55
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:29,440
the trouble is more complex than that.
See,

56
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:31,030
wave functions obey this very,

57
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:33,430
very nice equation called
the Schrodinger equation.

58
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:36,310
It's a really beautiful
differential equation.

59
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:41,230
It sort of smells like a law
of physics, right? It, uh,

60
00:03:41,231 --> 00:03:46,120
it's, it's the quantum
mechanics equivalent of Newton's
second law. F equals m.

61
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,140
A. It's a good equation.
We like it. It's pretty,

62
00:03:50,141 --> 00:03:52,820
it says that wave functions wave,

63
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,980
it says that the unusual late smoothly
and they don't make sudden changes.

64
00:03:56,981 --> 00:04:00,160
They don't do anything. Well,
they do some surprising things,

65
00:04:00,161 --> 00:04:04,820
but they don't make any
sudden moves. Um, but,

66
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:09,370
but the strange thing is
that wave functions don't
always obey the Schrodinger

67
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:13,390
equation.
Sometimes when we go and look for a thing,

68
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,860
the wave function of that thing suddenly
doesn't obey the Schrodinger equation

69
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,590
anymore. The Schrodinger equation
is temporarily suspended.

70
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:25,450
When we make a measurement and
instead the wave function collapses.

71
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,850
All those numbers scattered
across all of space.

72
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:32,410
They go to zero everywhere except in
the place where we found the object.

73
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,740
Now that's somewhat
strange, right? Like I said,

74
00:04:35,741 --> 00:04:38,320
the Schrodinger equation
smells like a law of physics.

75
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,280
We don't expect the laws of physics to
get temporarily suspended when we make a

76
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:47,050
measurement. Uh, that's, that's just
odd. What's even otter is, it's,

77
00:04:47,051 --> 00:04:51,190
it's kind of hard to define
what we mean by measurement.

78
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:53,230
What's a measurement?
It's a measurement.

79
00:04:53,231 --> 00:04:56,200
When I measure the measurements
only when I measure,

80
00:04:56,201 --> 00:05:00,130
why am I giving you a talk about quantum
mechanics where not only applies to me

81
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,360
a solid system isn't really a good look
on anybody and it's not a good look for

82
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:08,650
physics. Um, is it only when
humans measure? Now Einstein asked,

83
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:12,340
can a mouse collapse the wave function?
Uh,

84
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:15,800
that doesn't seem quite right either.
It seems like it shouldn't really have to,

85
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,620
anything to do with life or consciousness.
That's, that's not where we want to go.

86
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:25,000
And, and that doesn't really make the
idea of measurement less weird anyway.

87
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:29,410
Maybe it's when a big thing interacts
with this world of the ultra tiny,

88
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:30,370
the world of the quantum,

89
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,850
but there's no experimental evidence
that that's correct. And in fact,

90
00:05:33,851 --> 00:05:37,000
there is a great deal of evidence that
suggests that quantum mechanics doesn't

91
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:38,920
have that kind of size limit.

92
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,470
So there's just a host of thorny
problems here about what we mean by

93
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:48,220
measurement. When wave functions
collapse, what prompts them to collapse?

94
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,910
What's going on here?
And this is given a special name,

95
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,320
it's called the measurement problem.

96
00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:00,180
Now it's tempting to say that what's
really going on here is that the wave

97
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,590
function isn't a thing in the world.

98
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,080
It's just a measure of
probability in some way.

99
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,800
And that is the standard way of thinking
about wave functions is that they just

100
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:12,380
tell us the probability of finding
a thing in a particular spot.

101
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,380
And then you know, the idea of
collapse somewhat, you know,

102
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:19,580
it looks somewhat less strange
it because then you know, okay,

103
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,660
we don't know where it is.

104
00:06:20,661 --> 00:06:22,880
And then we look and we find
it and now we know where it is.

105
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,790
And so the probability of it
being elsewhere has gone to zero.

106
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,040
And that's why wave functions collapse.

107
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:33,410
But it can't be quite that straightforward
because wave functions do some things

108
00:06:33,411 --> 00:06:37,760
that we associate with physical waves
like water waves or sound waves or light

109
00:06:37,761 --> 00:06:41,540
waves. Wave functions can actually
cause interference patterns to appear.

110
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:45,800
That's not something that we think of
mere probabilities as being able to do

111
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,520
that doesn't mean that it's not
probability. It just means that if it is,

112
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,170
it's not straight forward.

113
00:06:51,171 --> 00:06:56,171
There has to be a more complicated story
here to explain what's going on and

114
00:06:56,211 --> 00:06:57,620
there's also the question of,
okay,

115
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:02,690
so before we measure where is the object
that's described by this sort of spread

116
00:07:02,691 --> 00:07:05,930
out wave function, where is the
marker before we look forward?

117
00:07:05,931 --> 00:07:08,600
If it's way function is
scattered across all of space.

118
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,380
Now the standard answer here is to say
that it's not really in one place or

119
00:07:12,381 --> 00:07:13,910
another.
It's,

120
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,450
it's in multiple places
at once and you know,

121
00:07:17,451 --> 00:07:20,000
we don't see markers in more than
one place at once, but you know,

122
00:07:20,001 --> 00:07:21,950
maybe subatomic particles,

123
00:07:21,951 --> 00:07:24,620
maybe atoms and molecules can
perform that kind of trick.

124
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:29,390
But if we concede that, if we say,
yeah, that's definitely what's going on,

125
00:07:29,391 --> 00:07:34,160
then we run into the most famous
version of the measurement pub problem,

126
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,160
which is Schrodinger's cat.
And you knew that this was coming.

127
00:07:37,161 --> 00:07:40,220
It's a talk on quantum physics. So, uh,

128
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:44,120
Schrodinger put this together
in 1935 he said, okay,

129
00:07:44,121 --> 00:07:47,630
say that you take a cat and a bunch of
equipment, you seal it inside of a box.

130
00:07:47,631 --> 00:07:48,920
You can't see what's going on in there.

131
00:07:48,921 --> 00:07:53,921
But what you've put in there with the
cat is a very weak radioactive source.

132
00:07:54,571 --> 00:07:56,750
So lump of slightly radioactive metals,

133
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,620
and you've hooked it up to
a Geiger counter and the
Geiger counter detects that

134
00:08:00,621 --> 00:08:04,100
radiation. And if it detects
radiation, it releases the hammer,

135
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:07,670
which smashes the vial of cyanide,
which kills the cat.

136
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:12,230
So of measurement is really
what collapses way functions.

137
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:18,070
Then the wave function of this whole
system shouldn't collapse until you open

138
00:08:19,731 --> 00:08:20,780
the box.
In other words,

139
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:24,320
this piece of radiation that comes
out from the radioactive metal,

140
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:28,250
that's definitely a quantum
object. It's a small thing, right?

141
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:32,150
So it definitely obeys the laws of
quantum physics, which means that it's,

142
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:32,601
you know,

143
00:08:32,601 --> 00:08:35,750
in this traditional way of thinking
about wave functions is probability.

144
00:08:35,751 --> 00:08:39,740
It means that it's both been
released and remains in the metal,

145
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,220
which means that the Geiger counter
both goes off and doesn't go off,

146
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,710
which means that the hammer
falls and doesn't fall.

147
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:50,120
The cyanide is smashed and doesn't smash
and the cat is dead and alive until we

148
00:08:50,121 --> 00:08:53,960
opened the box and
Schrodinger Yuri is said,

149
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,350
this is ridiculous.
You know,

150
00:08:55,351 --> 00:08:58,170
maybe subatomic particles can be
in more than one place at once,

151
00:08:58,171 --> 00:09:02,010
but cats are definitely not both
dead and alive until we open the box.

152
00:09:02,011 --> 00:09:05,370
That just can't be right.
That doesn't make any sense.

153
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:09,330
And the fact that this is what the
theory seems to imply with the equation,

154
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:13,230
that by the way, guys, I
wrote down, that seems wrong,

155
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:18,120
right? That doesn't seem to be
the way that the world works.

156
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,770
And that doesn't mean that quantum physics
is wrong. It's definitely not wrong.

157
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:27,150
It's just not done yet. It's not complete.
Or there's something else beyond it.

158
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:28,980
And this shouldn't be controversial,
right?

159
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:33,150
The idea that our scientific theories
aren't the whole story. Yeah, sure.

160
00:09:33,151 --> 00:09:34,680
There's going to be another theory.
You know,

161
00:09:34,681 --> 00:09:38,370
nobody thinks that our scientific theories
that we have right now are the end of

162
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:40,950
the story. And that's all the
Schrodinger was trying to say.

163
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,860
He was saying there's something incomplete
here in our understanding of what's

164
00:09:43,861 --> 00:09:45,300
going on in quantum physics,

165
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,880
but despite the fact that this seems
reasonable and straightforward,

166
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:54,960
most of Schrodinger's contemporaries
profoundly disagreed with him.

167
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:59,640
So people like Niels Bohr, uh,
or Verner, Heisenberg, Boris,

168
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:04,260
the guy on the left of that
picture from my perspective.

169
00:10:04,261 --> 00:10:06,090
So I guess right from your perspective,

170
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,100
Heisenberg is the younger one on the
other side. So, um, Bohr and Heisenberg,

171
00:10:11,101 --> 00:10:14,190
two of the other sort of
founders of quantum physics,

172
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:19,110
they profoundly disagree with
Schrodinger as did many of Schrodinger's

173
00:10:19,111 --> 00:10:23,220
contemporaries. And many of the other
people who put together quantum physics,

174
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,240
they said, no, this is wrong.
This whole thing with the cat,

175
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,840
it's a misunderstanding. Some
of them said, yeah, you know,

176
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:35,490
it's just wrong to talk about what's
going on in the box before we open it.

177
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:40,520
Because what's going on in the box before
we look is in principle on observable.

178
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,150
And it's on the scientific to talk
about on observable things. In fact,

179
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,510
it's meaningless to talk about
unobservable things. This is,

180
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,620
this is the lesson of the philosophy
of language that comes out of quantum

181
00:10:52,621 --> 00:10:55,950
physics. Others said, no, no, no, no,
no. It's not that. It's meaningless.

182
00:10:55,951 --> 00:10:59,820
It's that opening the box really does
force the cat to be dead or alive.

183
00:10:59,821 --> 00:11:04,290
And until we look, it really isn't either
one. Others said, no, no, no, no, no.

184
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,340
Quantum physics you've completely missed
supplied to this theory that you helped

185
00:11:08,341 --> 00:11:08,970
develop.

186
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:13,970
Quantum physics has by necessity a split
between the measurer and the measured.

187
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:18,660
And the problem with the cat experiment
that you've set up is you're trying to

188
00:11:18,661 --> 00:11:23,190
get rid of that division. And that's
what's leading to the confusion. Uh,

189
00:11:23,191 --> 00:11:25,080
and others said, no. You know, you're,

190
00:11:25,081 --> 00:11:28,050
you're trying to say that quantum
physics tells us how the world is.

191
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:31,380
Quantum physics isn't
about how the world is.

192
00:11:31,381 --> 00:11:35,310
Quantum physics is just a tool that
we use to predict the outcomes of

193
00:11:35,311 --> 00:11:37,860
measurements. That's all
it is. It's an instrument.

194
00:11:37,861 --> 00:11:40,140
It's not a theory about
the state of the world.

195
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:46,250
And this collection of
vague related questionably,

196
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,800
coherent contradictory claims.

197
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,170
This is known as the
Copenhagen interpretation.

198
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:57,340
This named after the home of Neil
Spores Institute in Copenhagen,

199
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:02,341
which was the center of the physics world
for much of the first half of the 20th

200
00:12:02,741 --> 00:12:03,574
century.

201
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:08,420
And the Copenhagen interpretation,
like I said,

202
00:12:08,421 --> 00:12:12,310
this seems somewhat country contradictory.
It seems somewhat vague.

203
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,610
Uh, what does it have to say
about the measurement problem?

204
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:18,360
What does it say leaves to
wave function collapses?

205
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:22,990
What does it say is going on there?
How do we define what measurement is?

206
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,180
How do we say when wave
functions collapsed,

207
00:12:25,181 --> 00:12:28,840
when does the Schrodinger equation
apply and when is it suspended?

208
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:35,260
The standard answer that the Copenhagen
interpretation gives to all of these

209
00:12:35,261 --> 00:12:40,120
thorny questions at the heart of
the theory is somewhat unsatisfying.

210
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:45,730
Um, basically it says,
shut up and calculate. Um,

211
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:49,210
and, and this is not quite as foolish
as it first appears because again,

212
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,160
quantum physics works remarkably well.
It is incredibly good.

213
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:59,250
I can't stress this enough. I
mean quantum physics, uh, is,

214
00:12:59,251 --> 00:13:04,251
is really responsible for most of the
technological breakthroughs of the last 90

215
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:05,650
years.

216
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:10,030
It is an incredibly good theory and
these questions at the heart of it really

217
00:13:10,031 --> 00:13:11,230
seemed very thorny.

218
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,350
And so you have a choice of either
trying to bang your head against these

219
00:13:14,351 --> 00:13:15,670
questions or you know,

220
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:18,640
contribute to one of the greatest
revolutions in the history of science

221
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:23,020
revolution that gave rise not only too
much of modern technology but much of

222
00:13:23,021 --> 00:13:24,070
modern science.

223
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:28,930
I mean the whole field of genetics was
based on imaging breakthroughs that came

224
00:13:28,931 --> 00:13:32,410
from quantum physics for example.
Um,

225
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,680
but shutting up in calculating,

226
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:39,370
saying all of these
things that the Copenhagen
interpretation wants to tell us,

227
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:45,460
it is unsatisfying. And I'll take
questions at the end. I really will.

228
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:50,340
This talk is not going to take the
whole time nowhere near. Um, uh,

229
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:54,820
but I, I'm excited to hear
your question. So, um, there,

230
00:13:54,821 --> 00:13:57,640
there is a problem with shutting up and
calculate and there are several problems.

231
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:01,990
One problem is that, you know, we,

232
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:09,180
we want to understand what
is going on in the world.

233
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,950
Quantum physics tells
us why the sun shines.

234
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:15,400
But if quantum physics really is just
an instrument for predicting outcomes,

235
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:18,010
quantum physics doesn't
tell us why the sun shines.

236
00:14:18,011 --> 00:14:21,400
It has no explanatory power at all.
It only has predictive power.

237
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,820
So it doesn't explain why I'm
not passing through the floor.

238
00:14:24,821 --> 00:14:29,260
It doesn't explain why I can see. It
just says I won't pass through the floor.

239
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,930
It doesn't tell us where
those things come from.

240
00:14:31,931 --> 00:14:34,990
It doesn't give us a picture of the world.
Uh,

241
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:38,680
and if that sounds a little bit wishy
washy, let me make it more clear.

242
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,050
Quantum physics, if the Copenhagen
interpretation is correct,

243
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:49,300
there's no reason why it's true.
There's no reason why it works. In fact,

244
00:14:49,301 --> 00:14:52,910
its success is just a coincidence
because quantum physics,

245
00:14:52,911 --> 00:14:54,860
according to the
Copenhagen interpretation,

246
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,280
isn't about anything in the world.

247
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:02,870
There's nothing in the world that is
even approximately described by the

248
00:15:02,871 --> 00:15:06,860
equations of quantum physics. And if
that's true, why does the theory work?

249
00:15:06,861 --> 00:15:10,430
What makes it true?
The fact that it works at all,

250
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:13,670
even though it has no connection
to anything in reality,

251
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,370
would be nothing short of a miracle,

252
00:15:16,371 --> 00:15:20,870
a phenomenal coincidence if it's just
a trick for calculating that has no

253
00:15:20,871 --> 00:15:25,010
relationship to the things in the
world around us. On top of that,

254
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,380
uh, there are some scientific projects
that we want to do as physicists,

255
00:15:30,381 --> 00:15:35,060
which the Copenhagen interpretation
explicitly or implicitly makes very

256
00:15:35,061 --> 00:15:36,190
difficult to impossible.

257
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:41,180
We want to think that measurement is a
physical process and physical processes

258
00:15:41,181 --> 00:15:43,460
should be amenable to analysis.

259
00:15:43,461 --> 00:15:46,970
We should be able to come up with a
physical theory of how measurement works,

260
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,690
but the Copenhagen interpretation
says, no, you can't do that.

261
00:15:50,691 --> 00:15:55,691
There is no need or way to come up
with a quantum theory of measurement.

262
00:15:56,181 --> 00:15:56,511
In fact,

263
00:15:56,511 --> 00:16:01,040
Niels Bohr himself said that coming up
with the quantum theory of measurement

264
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:05,210
was fundamentally misguided as
a scientific project. We also,

265
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,730
and I mean this is near and
dear to my heart, this next one,

266
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,740
we want to be able to do cosmology.

267
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:14,050
We want to be able to study the
entire universe at once. Um,

268
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,530
but if we have to split the universe
into the measured and the measurer,

269
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:19,910
we can't do that.

270
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:24,380
And if we have to split the universe
into the measured and the measure,

271
00:16:24,381 --> 00:16:28,400
we have an even bigger problem.
We want to account for classical physics,

272
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:31,430
the physics of Isaac Newton
using quantum physics.

273
00:16:31,431 --> 00:16:32,750
That's why the theory was developed.

274
00:16:32,751 --> 00:16:37,751
It was developed to explain situations
that we couldn't explain using classical

275
00:16:37,971 --> 00:16:41,170
physics.
And yet if measurements are,

276
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:45,170
are a necessary part of the theory on
those measurements cannot be described

277
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:49,220
using quantum physics. They can only be
described using classical physics. Again,

278
00:16:49,221 --> 00:16:51,410
as Niels Bohr and company said,

279
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:56,060
then we can't ground classical physics
in quantum physics. If anything,

280
00:16:56,061 --> 00:16:56,990
it's the other way around.

281
00:16:56,991 --> 00:17:00,950
The logical foundations of quantum
physics require classical physics.

282
00:17:00,951 --> 00:17:02,360
And that seems really strange,

283
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:06,740
especially because there's
nothing particularly special
about classical physics.

284
00:17:06,741 --> 00:17:10,100
You know, uh, Bohr and Heisenberg,
they said things like, oh,

285
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:14,900
the idea of measurement has to be grounded
in classical physics because that's

286
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:18,880
the way our intuitions work.
They read a lot of cons. Um,

287
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:23,920
and that's not true because classical
physics is profoundly counter intuitive.

288
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:28,670
Our intuitions are no more classical
than they are grounded in witchcraft or

289
00:17:28,671 --> 00:17:33,230
astrology or classical physics
has many surprising results.

290
00:17:33,231 --> 00:17:36,920
If you've ever done that thing where
you sit in a spinning chair and you hold

291
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:40,770
the bicycle wheel, I didn't see that
coming the first time they did that.

292
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:45,350
I don't think any of us do. So yeah,
that, that can't be right either.

293
00:17:45,351 --> 00:17:50,351
So the Copenhagen interpretation
is profoundly unsatisfying
both scientifically

294
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:55,740
and philosophically.
Now it's time for a couple of disclaimers.

295
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:59,190
So here's the thing,

296
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,330
despite the fact that the Copenhagen
interpretation is unsatisfactory,

297
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:06,840
it is still the default interpretation.

298
00:18:06,841 --> 00:18:11,010
It is the standard interpretation
of quantum physics today.

299
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,540
It is what is used in most popular
science books on the subject.

300
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:20,800
It is what is presented in basically
every single widely used quantum physics

301
00:18:22,081 --> 00:18:24,450
textbook in undergraduate
and graduate courses.

302
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:27,900
I was exposed to it in that way as well.
Um,

303
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:31,410
it's what you learned in school.
It is what many,

304
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:36,411
if not most physicists believe to be
true and they believe this to hold the

305
00:18:36,451 --> 00:18:38,040
answer to the measurement problem,

306
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:43,460
especially older physicist as
the Copenhagen interpretation
was once massively

307
00:18:44,281 --> 00:18:48,270
overwhelmingly dominant. It's dominance
has declined over the last few decades.

308
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:53,940
So the first disclaimer is what I
just told you is a minority view.

309
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:57,600
I am in the minority. What I
just told you is not, you know,

310
00:18:57,601 --> 00:19:00,300
the standard story that you
get in a quantum physics class.

311
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:05,640
So given that this is a minority view,
why am I so sure that I'm right?

312
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:09,720
Why am I so willing to
come up here to Google?

313
00:19:09,721 --> 00:19:12,990
And other places have been giving
this talk and say, yeah, no,

314
00:19:12,991 --> 00:19:16,650
the Copenhagen interpretation
doesn't work. Well,

315
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:21,240
there is definitely some controversy
over the foundations of quantum physics

316
00:19:21,241 --> 00:19:22,110
among physicists,

317
00:19:22,111 --> 00:19:26,790
but the history and
philosophy of quantum physics,

318
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,580
that's a different story.
In broad strokes,

319
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,590
there is an understanding of what
happened over the last 90 years and the

320
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:39,210
development of quantum physics and the
philosophy underpinning the stories that

321
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:44,211
we tell about quantum physics and that
history and philosophy is wildly unknown

322
00:19:46,621 --> 00:19:47,880
to most physicists.

323
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:52,910
Physicists have a set of historical
and philosophical myths that they tell

324
00:19:52,981 --> 00:19:53,880
amongst themselves,

325
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:57,900
kind of folk history that's passed
down from generation to generation of

326
00:19:57,901 --> 00:20:02,670
physicists, either explicitly
or implicitly about the
history of quantum physics.

327
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,820
And why we believe the things that
we're told to believe about it,

328
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,730
that folk history is very wrong.

329
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:12,900
It is just as a matter of
historical fact incorrect.

330
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:18,510
And I'm going to explain to you what that
folk history is and then tell you what

331
00:20:18,511 --> 00:20:21,030
actually happened.
Which leads me to my second disclaimer,

332
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:25,740
which is that the best psych research
suggests that if you're trying to debunk a

333
00:20:25,741 --> 00:20:29,250
myth, you shouldn't
repeat the myth first. Um,

334
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,840
I'm gonna throw caution to
the wind and tell you this.

335
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:38,130
Folk history, this completely mythical
account of the history of quantum physics.

336
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,740
And then I'm going to
tell you why it's wrong.

337
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,340
So with all the stuff that
I'm about to tell you,

338
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,770
take it with a grain of salt.
So here we go.

339
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,260
Once upon a time,

340
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:55,480
there was a group of phenomenally
talented physicists, uh,

341
00:20:55,570 --> 00:21:00,310
working in a loose team in the first
quarter of the 20th century to try to

342
00:21:00,311 --> 00:21:04,420
understand what was going on
in the world of the ultra tiny,

343
00:21:04,421 --> 00:21:07,360
the world of atoms and
subatomic particles. Now,

344
00:21:07,361 --> 00:21:10,210
this team didn't have a leader per se,

345
00:21:10,211 --> 00:21:14,470
but they had a kind of spiritual guide in
their request. And that was Niels Bohr,

346
00:21:14,471 --> 00:21:19,090
who again, is, he's the older guy in
the picture over off on the side. Um,

347
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:24,930
and this team also included phenomenally
talented physicists like Verner

348
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:29,170
Heisenberg in the Middle Paoli
sitting across from Bor. Um,

349
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:33,740
and many other physicists be besides,
you know, Erwin Schrodinger, her, uh,

350
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:38,140
Louis boy, uh, a wide
collection of physicists.

351
00:21:38,141 --> 00:21:40,540
And over the course of the first
quarter of the 20th century,

352
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:43,990
they developed the first real
theories of quantum mechanics.

353
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:49,680
And with these theories came a single
unified picture of how to think about

354
00:21:49,871 --> 00:21:52,810
quantum mechanics called the
Copenhagen interpretation.

355
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:57,310
And the Copenhagen interpretation said
questions about what's happening before

356
00:21:57,311 --> 00:22:00,790
you look at quantum
objects are meaningless.

357
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:04,930
It's not sensical to
even ask those questions.

358
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:10,110
The world is fundamentally random and
quantum mechanics is the best theory that

359
00:22:10,691 --> 00:22:14,920
we can come up with to understand
what's going on in the quantum world.

360
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:19,660
And this really bothered Albert Einstein.

361
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:23,320
Most physicists were very happy
to accept this, but Einstein,

362
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:27,340
Einstein had once been a bomb throwing
revolutionary in his youth. He had,

363
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:31,780
he had blown up the physics world with
special relativity and then 10 years

364
00:22:31,781 --> 00:22:35,220
later, general relativity.
But that was long ago. Uh,

365
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:40,240
now he was old. He was stuck in
his ways. He was conservative,

366
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,720
and he couldn't accept that quantum
physics could be fundamentally random.

367
00:22:46,001 --> 00:22:49,210
He couldn't accept that the
world wasn't deterministic.

368
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:54,570
He was sure that the theory had
to be self contradictory or if not

369
00:22:55,091 --> 00:22:58,990
contradictory, incomplete or
wrong in some fundamental way,

370
00:22:58,991 --> 00:23:02,560
because determinism had to be
true according to Einstein.

371
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:07,360
So he developed a set of
thought experiments intended
to show that the theory

372
00:23:07,361 --> 00:23:08,320
was contradictory.

373
00:23:08,321 --> 00:23:12,160
And in particular he went after this
thing called the Heisenberg uncertainty

374
00:23:12,161 --> 00:23:12,994
principle.

375
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:16,000
And the Heisenberg uncertainty principle
says that you can't know both the

376
00:23:16,001 --> 00:23:19,420
position and the velocity,
the moment really the momentum,

377
00:23:19,421 --> 00:23:24,421
but whatever the position and the
momentum of an object at the same time too

378
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:25,720
arbitrary precision.

379
00:23:25,721 --> 00:23:28,900
He came up with a bunch of
thought experiments to try
to show that this wasn't

380
00:23:28,901 --> 00:23:29,111
true,

381
00:23:29,111 --> 00:23:34,111
but bore and bores team of researchers
showed at every turn that Einstein was

382
00:23:34,211 --> 00:23:34,901
incorrect,

383
00:23:34,901 --> 00:23:39,040
that he had misunderstood things and
this culminated in a thought experiment

384
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:44,160
where Einstein devised a box filled
with light that was hanging on a scale

385
00:23:45,921 --> 00:23:49,550
spring with a clock attached to it and
a little door in the side and he showed

386
00:23:49,551 --> 00:23:52,970
that you could use this to get around a
different uncertainty relationship and

387
00:23:52,971 --> 00:23:55,430
quantum physics, the energy
time, uncertainty relation,

388
00:23:56,090 --> 00:24:00,770
but bore took a look at this thing and
prove that Einstein was wrong for an

389
00:24:00,771 --> 00:24:03,230
incredibly embarrassing
reason. He said, Einstein,

390
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:06,530
you forgotten your own
theory of general relativity,

391
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,990
which shows that this cannot work.

392
00:24:08,991 --> 00:24:12,380
You cannot use this device to
get around the energy time,

393
00:24:12,381 --> 00:24:14,960
uncertainty relationship.
Einstein, of course,

394
00:24:14,961 --> 00:24:19,580
was incredibly embarrassed and he laid
low for a while and then he came up with

395
00:24:19,581 --> 00:24:23,540
a new thought experiment that was going
to show the world that quantum physics

396
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:24,710
couldn't be correct.

397
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,850
And so he came up with something called
the EPR thought experiment named after

398
00:24:28,851 --> 00:24:33,851
Einstein and his two coauthors on the
paper Podolsky and Rosen and the EPR paper

399
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,880
showed that you had to be able to
get around the uncertainty principle.

400
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,170
And if you couldn't,

401
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:44,320
that would mean that either quantum
physics was incomplete or that there was

402
00:24:44,661 --> 00:24:46,580
something going faster than light.

403
00:24:46,581 --> 00:24:50,990
Somehow Bor responded to this.
You know,

404
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:53,810
Einstein said nothing could
possibly be going faster than light.

405
00:24:53,811 --> 00:24:58,160
That would be spooky. Action at a
distance board gave a response, you know,

406
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:02,430
brilliantly dismissing Einstein's
concerns. Most physicists thought, okay,

407
00:25:02,431 --> 00:25:03,410
you know,
that's the end of it.

408
00:25:03,411 --> 00:25:06,290
We still don't quite know which
one could be right, but you know,

409
00:25:06,291 --> 00:25:08,690
it's a matter of philosophy.
We don't need to think about that.

410
00:25:08,691 --> 00:25:12,890
And then 30 years later,
after both Bohr and Einstein were dead,

411
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:17,570
a physicist named John Bell came along
and he proved that Bora was right.

412
00:25:17,571 --> 00:25:19,340
And Einstein was wrong,

413
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:24,940
and that you could not have some more
complete theory of how quantum physics

414
00:25:25,701 --> 00:25:28,910
works without violating the
predictions of quantum physics.

415
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:34,840
And thus the world was made
safe for quantum physics
and everybody lived happily

416
00:25:36,621 --> 00:25:41,420
ever after. So how much of
what I just told you is true?

417
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,760
Not a whole lot.
Most of that is just wrong.

418
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:51,170
As a matter of historical fact,
if you look at contemporary evidence,

419
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:54,770
you know letters that people sent to
each other lecture notes rather than

420
00:25:54,771 --> 00:25:55,960
looking at,
you know,

421
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:58,940
people's recollections of what
happened years after the fact.

422
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,310
Here's what actually happened.

423
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:06,260
It is true that Bohr and Heisenberg
and Paoli and a group of brilliant

424
00:26:06,261 --> 00:26:09,590
physicists did put together the first
true theories of quantum physics.

425
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:14,270
It is true that Einstein was among them
and that Einstein didn't like the theory.

426
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,590
Einstein though,

427
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:20,000
when these debates between him and
board started in the mid to late 1920s,

428
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,210
he, um, he was in his forties.

429
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:28,130
He wasn't exactly old and senile.
He was in perfectly good shape.

430
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:33,080
And his main concern actually had
nothing to do with the fact that quantum

431
00:26:33,081 --> 00:26:37,130
physics presented a world that was,
you know,

432
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,390
fundamentally random.

433
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,230
He had two major concerns aside from
that one that was like a secondary or

434
00:26:43,231 --> 00:26:44,370
tertiary concern.

435
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:49,970
He was concerned that quantum physics
didn't give us a real picture of the world

436
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:52,380
independent of observation.

437
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,930
So he's concerned about realism and he
was also concerned and he felt that these

438
00:26:57,931 --> 00:27:01,950
were two sides of the same coin, that
because quantum physics was not relist,

439
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:07,250
it was also doomed to have nonlocality
spooky action at a distance.

440
00:27:08,071 --> 00:27:09,180
Things influencing,

441
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:13,950
influencing each other at a distance
faster than the speed of light.

442
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:18,000
Instantaneously. Even nine sign
felt that that couldn't be right.

443
00:27:18,001 --> 00:27:19,740
Not only because it
would violate relativity,

444
00:27:19,741 --> 00:27:22,770
but because he felt it would make
it near impossible to do science.

445
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:29,920
And he thought the Copenhagen
interpretation was not only not realist,

446
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:32,260
but in so far as it was relist,

447
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:35,410
it was nonlocal and
that he could not abide.

448
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:40,360
And so he came up with a series of
thought experiments not to get around the

449
00:27:40,361 --> 00:27:43,330
uncertainty principles.
Mostly he had one or two like that.

450
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:48,630
Mostly his thought experiments
were intended to show
that quantum physics was a

451
00:27:48,781 --> 00:27:49,614
local.

452
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,710
This one was meant to show that
quantum physics was nonlocal.

453
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:56,950
It had nothing to do with the energy,

454
00:27:56,951 --> 00:28:00,820
time on certainty relationship aside
from the fact that it did enter into the

455
00:28:00,821 --> 00:28:04,660
setup in a way, but Einstein wasn't
trying to get around it any way.

456
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,200
Bor completely misunderstood what Einstein
was trying to get at with this setup.

457
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,330
He thought Einstein was trying
to get around the energy,

458
00:28:13,331 --> 00:28:14,710
time on certainty relationship,

459
00:28:14,711 --> 00:28:19,711
and thus show that quantum physics was
inconsistent internally and then in order

460
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,570
to answer this supposedly
argument from Einstein.

461
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:26,290
Bohr brought in a totally separate theory
that we still don't know how to make

462
00:28:26,291 --> 00:28:30,370
consistent with quantum physics in order
to defend the internal consistency of

463
00:28:30,371 --> 00:28:32,440
quantum physics.
In other words,

464
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:37,530
he gave a profoundly inadequate
argument in response to an argument that

465
00:28:37,601 --> 00:28:39,700
Einstein wasn't even making.

466
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:43,720
This should have been a massive
embarrassment for Neil Spore

467
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,200
and the standard story around this.

468
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:50,620
This thought experiment is
just completely confused.

469
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,510
Einstein, meanwhile went home
and thought, you know, Shit,

470
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,030
boar still doesn't understand
what I'm getting at.

471
00:28:58,090 --> 00:28:59,650
Let me make it simpler for him.

472
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:03,100
Thus was born the EPR thought experiment.

473
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:07,150
And so after more debates
between Einstein and Bohr,

474
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:10,930
Einstein put together
this thought experiment,

475
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:15,370
the EPR thought experiment. He published
it with his friends, collaborators,

476
00:29:15,371 --> 00:29:19,270
Podolsky and Rosen.
And after it came out,

477
00:29:19,271 --> 00:29:21,760
he actually wasn't that happy with the
way that the paper was put together,

478
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:26,410
but he then wrote about it more in both
letters and essays through the rest of

479
00:29:26,411 --> 00:29:28,510
his life.
Um,

480
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:32,200
and he made it very clear that the
point of this thing was that there was a

481
00:29:32,201 --> 00:29:35,950
forced choice.
There was a choice for quantum physics.

482
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:41,100
It could either be incomplete and
local or complete and nonlocal.

483
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:48,130
So he was saying if the
Copenhagen interpretation is
really the end of the story

484
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,530
than something has to be
going faster than light

485
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:55,330
or gave a response to the APR paper.

486
00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:01,000
It was really, really hard to understand
what bores response was saying.

487
00:30:01,001 --> 00:30:04,990
And I'm not just saying that because I've
read it and it makes no frigging sense.

488
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:08,650
I'm saying that because Boris said it did.
It was hard to understand.

489
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:11,080
[inaudible] actually wrote
about this about 15 years later,

490
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,720
he wrote about these debates that
he had with Einstein completely

491
00:30:13,721 --> 00:30:16,330
mischaracterized them, and then
when he got to that part, he said,

492
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:21,520
I responded to the EPR paper. I apologize
for being so difficult to understand,

493
00:30:21,521 --> 00:30:24,910
and then he moved on. He didn't actually
explain what he meant. He just said,

494
00:30:24,911 --> 00:30:27,760
I know it was hard to understand,
and then he moved on. Nonetheless,

495
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:32,790
despite the fact that bore his writing
was sort of convoluted in obscure people

496
00:30:33,311 --> 00:30:36,340
felt that these deep philosophical
puzzles at the heard of the theory,

497
00:30:36,341 --> 00:30:39,670
we're actually better addressed
by convoluted, obscure writing.

498
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:44,671
That may be answers unclear rather than
Einstein's very clear direct writing.

499
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,470
That made it obvious that
there was a problem here.

500
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:52,420
Part of that was because you know
this confusion between obscurity and

501
00:30:52,421 --> 00:30:53,051
profundity,

502
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:58,051
part of it was that bore worked
collaboratively with a group of people

503
00:30:58,061 --> 00:31:01,360
throughout his entire life and so
he had more people just on his side

504
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:05,500
politically. Whereas Einstein, with
someone who usually worked alone,

505
00:31:05,501 --> 00:31:09,220
Einstein described himself as going
through life like a one horse cart.

506
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:11,440
He did not really work with people.

507
00:31:11,441 --> 00:31:13,780
He didn't build a school
of thought around himself,

508
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:18,190
and part of it was just an Einstein
was making very uncomfortable argument.

509
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:22,690
Einstein was saying, no, we're not
done. There's more work to be done here.

510
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,670
Whereas board was saying, no, it's cool.

511
00:31:24,671 --> 00:31:27,040
Let's go off and keep doing
what we've been doing.

512
00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:31,750
You don't have to worry about this. You
can just shut up and calculate. Now,

513
00:31:31,751 --> 00:31:35,980
part of the reason that board won the
day was also that there was a proof by

514
00:31:35,981 --> 00:31:40,981
John von Neumann that had been published
in 1932 saying that there was no way to

515
00:31:42,431 --> 00:31:47,431
come up with a more complete theory
of quantum physics that you couldn't,

516
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:51,880
you know, add something to the theory
and thus get, you know, something,

517
00:31:51,881 --> 00:31:52,840
not statistical,

518
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:57,280
something that that gives
you more complete picture
of reality without actually

519
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,570
changing the predictions of the
theory and nobody, not even Einstein,

520
00:32:01,571 --> 00:32:04,060
wanted to change the predictions
of the theory because the theory is

521
00:32:04,061 --> 00:32:05,590
phenomenally successful.

522
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:11,110
So von Neumann's proof and bores writings
sort of helped quantum physics carry

523
00:32:11,111 --> 00:32:14,390
along. Now, there was
just one problem. Von Noi,

524
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:17,530
I'm in one of the greatest mathematicians
to have ever lived. Made a mistake,

525
00:32:17,531 --> 00:32:20,530
has proof was wrong. This was actually
pointed out by the mathematician,

526
00:32:20,531 --> 00:32:22,990
Gretta Herman only a few years later.

527
00:32:22,991 --> 00:32:27,970
But people didn't listen to her probably
in part because she was a woman. Uh,

528
00:32:27,971 --> 00:32:31,860
and in the 1930s women we're usually not
even allowed to teach at universities,

529
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:35,530
much less proof John von Neumann wrong.
Um,

530
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:40,880
so quantum physics just sort
carrying on with a whole lot.

531
00:32:40,881 --> 00:32:45,881
It's hard piling success upon success
over the course of the Manhattan project

532
00:32:46,281 --> 00:32:47,390
and World War Two,

533
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:51,710
which incidentally after the Manhattan
project and all that money poured into

534
00:32:51,711 --> 00:32:55,670
physics classroom sizes ballooned
and the historian of physics,

535
00:32:55,671 --> 00:33:00,230
David Kaiser at Mit has done a fascinating
study showing that the amount of time

536
00:33:00,231 --> 00:33:04,070
devoted to foundational questions
in quantum physics in you know,

537
00:33:04,071 --> 00:33:09,071
course syllabi after World War II is
inversely proportional to classroom size.

538
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:11,930
So the larger the classroom,

539
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:15,530
the less time they spend talking about
these questions at the heart of quantum

540
00:33:15,531 --> 00:33:19,010
physics, which makes some sense,
it's hard to address them properly.

541
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:22,520
So after the war,

542
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:27,260
young physicist named David Boehme came
up with a different way of thinking

543
00:33:27,261 --> 00:33:28,490
about quantum physics.

544
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:33,670
He discovered that you could just take
the equations as they were and develop an

545
00:33:34,911 --> 00:33:37,880
entirely different picture of
nature to go along with it.

546
00:33:37,881 --> 00:33:42,881
One that involved waves and particles
and was entirely deterministic in

547
00:33:43,371 --> 00:33:45,950
particular.
It involves particles,

548
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:50,540
sort of surfing on waves and those
waves would guide the particles,

549
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:54,380
the waves could interfere with themselves
and with other waves and they would

550
00:33:54,381 --> 00:33:58,310
guide the, you know, motion
of the particles to, you know,

551
00:33:58,311 --> 00:34:02,120
appear in the correct locations as to
make the predictions of quantum physics

552
00:34:02,121 --> 00:34:04,820
true. And this became
known as pilot wave theory.

553
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:09,890
But this was largely dismissed at the
time in part because of annoyance proof in

554
00:34:09,891 --> 00:34:13,880
part because boars ideas had already
become entrenched over the quarter century

555
00:34:13,881 --> 00:34:18,080
before that and part because
David Boehme had, um,

556
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:21,590
I'm going to go ahead and
call it shit luck. Uh,

557
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:26,620
David Boehme got really interested in
communism in the 1940s and then he got

558
00:34:27,051 --> 00:34:30,740
called up before the House on
American Activities Committee, uh,

559
00:34:30,741 --> 00:34:33,300
in the late 1940s chaired by,
um,

560
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:37,460
someone who probably haven't heard
of named Richard Nixon. And, um,

561
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:43,340
and then he got arrested on contempt of
Congress because he wouldn't name names

562
00:34:43,341 --> 00:34:47,480
because he had, you
know, integrity. And, um,

563
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:51,020
and then he was cleared because it turns
out there is in fact a fifth amendment

564
00:34:51,021 --> 00:34:55,850
of the United States constitution. Um,
but it didn't matter. He was blacklisted.

565
00:34:55,851 --> 00:34:58,280
He was fired from his job at Princeton.
And in fact,

566
00:34:58,281 --> 00:35:02,270
it was while he was waiting for his day
in court that he developed pilot wave

567
00:35:02,271 --> 00:35:04,700
theory, um, which had, by the way,

568
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:09,170
part of it had been previously discovered
25 years earlier by Louis deploy. But,

569
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,063
um,

570
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,940
but Boehm sort of independently
rediscovered it and then
completed the theory.

571
00:35:13,941 --> 00:35:17,630
But bomb was cleared on all charges.
But he was blacklisted at this,

572
00:35:17,631 --> 00:35:22,460
happened right after he
submitted his papers, even
before they were published. Um,

573
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:25,880
couldn't find a job to work in physics
anywhere in the u s despite having

574
00:35:25,881 --> 00:35:30,830
recommendation letters from Robert
Oppenheimer and Albert Einstein, um,

575
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,110
and ended up having to go to Brazil,

576
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:38,190
at which point his passport
was confiscated illegally
by the American Consulate.

577
00:35:38,191 --> 00:35:41,130
And he was trapped in Brazil
for almost five years.

578
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:46,650
During which time his papers
were published, discussed
without him being around,

579
00:35:46,651 --> 00:35:48,450
he could only corresponded a distance.

580
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:53,780
Many famous physicist's published papers
or gave talks explaining my bone was

581
00:35:54,031 --> 00:35:56,610
wrong without bone being
there to defend himself.

582
00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:01,350
And ultimately his ideas were
forgotten by most physicists,

583
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:02,640
but not all.

584
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:08,030
John Bell Read David Boams papers in 1952
when they were first published and he

585
00:36:09,181 --> 00:36:13,200
immediately knew that something was wrong,
not with belts,

586
00:36:13,201 --> 00:36:14,580
but not with bones papers.

587
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:19,610
He had been told of John von Neumann is
proof not have Gretta Hermanns, you know,

588
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:22,980
disproof of fond Nyman's proof
because nobody knew about that.

589
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:25,110
But he'd been told avant diamonds proof,

590
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:29,370
even though he had always
found the Copenhagen
interpretation hopelessly vague.

591
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,080
He said he knew it was a rotten,
um,

592
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:35,040
he figured there had
to be something better.

593
00:36:35,041 --> 00:36:38,370
But then he was told about von diamonds
proof and figured, okay, you know,

594
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:40,410
I must just not be
understanding something.

595
00:36:40,411 --> 00:36:43,920
And then he saw boams papers work
through them and realize, no,

596
00:36:43,921 --> 00:36:48,090
there's nothing wrong with this. There
must be a flaw on this proof problem.

597
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:51,060
Bell didn't speak German.
The proof was only published in German.

598
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:54,510
He couldn't go in and figure out what
was wrong with it until it was published

599
00:36:54,511 --> 00:36:58,590
in English a few years later, and by
then bell was busy with other things.

600
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:03,240
But in 1963,
bell came out to the South Bay,

601
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:03,751
actually.

602
00:37:03,751 --> 00:37:08,040
He got invited to be a visitor for a year
while he was on sabbatical from cern.

603
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:11,310
He was a visitor at
slack just down the road.

604
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:14,730
And while he was at slack,
he figured, you know,

605
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:18,990
I really hate the Copenhagen
interpretation. It just can't be right.

606
00:37:18,991 --> 00:37:22,440
And yet there's this proof from von
Neumann and these other proofs along the

607
00:37:22,441 --> 00:37:23,274
same lines,

608
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:26,670
I know that they're wrong because there's
nothing wrong with bones version of

609
00:37:26,671 --> 00:37:29,010
quantum physics.
And these proofs would rule it out.

610
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:32,450
Let me figure out what's wrong
with those proofs. So he sits down,

611
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,470
plays with them for awhile,

612
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:37,620
and he finds that von Neumann's
proof is not only broken.

613
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:39,810
He later characterized it as silly.

614
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,190
So he publishes a paper showing
that von Neumann is wrong,

615
00:37:44,191 --> 00:37:47,900
which gets lost in an editor's
desk for a couple of years.

616
00:37:47,901 --> 00:37:50,310
It was really unfortunate.
But then he says, okay,

617
00:37:50,311 --> 00:37:54,390
but there's something else funny about
bones version of quantum physics.

618
00:37:54,391 --> 00:37:56,610
It has this spooky action at a distance.

619
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:01,650
The position of a particle way over here
can instantaneously affect the behavior

620
00:38:01,651 --> 00:38:06,000
of a pilot wave way over here
that that seems strange. You know,

621
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,650
is there a way not doing that?

622
00:38:07,651 --> 00:38:11,400
Can I come up with something like bones
version of quantum physics without

623
00:38:11,401 --> 00:38:13,920
having this instantaneous
action at a distance?

624
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:17,970
So he starts working on it and
he realizes he can't do it.

625
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,510
And then he writes up a proof and that
proof has become known as bell's Theorem.

626
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:25,680
Bell's Theorem is one of the single most
profound and important results in all

627
00:38:25,681 --> 00:38:30,180
of quantum physics. It led to what's been
called the second quantum revolution,

628
00:38:30,181 --> 00:38:33,690
which among other things led to the
entire field of quantum information

629
00:38:33,691 --> 00:38:37,600
processing, quantum cryptography,
quantum computing, you name it. Um,

630
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:42,070
it's also profoundly misunderstood.
People often characterize bell's theorem.

631
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,600
Not only is proving that board was right,

632
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:47,560
but that proving that you can't have
anything like bones version of quantum

633
00:38:47,561 --> 00:38:49,180
physics or they'll say,
oh,

634
00:38:49,181 --> 00:38:54,070
it proves that either something is going
faster than light or you have hidden

635
00:38:54,071 --> 00:38:57,430
variables completing the Theorem, you
know, completing quantum physics saying,

636
00:38:57,431 --> 00:39:01,870
okay, you know, this is what's going on
before you look. That's not true. Uh,

637
00:39:01,871 --> 00:39:04,990
in fact, uh, bell himself
said that that wasn't true.

638
00:39:04,991 --> 00:39:06,640
That wasn't what the
proof was about at all.

639
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:11,200
It is pretty much just a proof
that nature is not local.

640
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:13,720
If it conforms with the
predictions of quantum physics.

641
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:18,730
There were only a couple of ways
out of that. One of them was, oh,

642
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,070
sorry, hold on. If you want to
learn more about bell's Theorem,

643
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:24,460
it is a whole subject
for a talk by itself.

644
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:29,700
I have an interactive essay explaining
it in more detail on my website. Um,

645
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:31,030
I'll leave that up there for a moment,

646
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:33,970
but there are only a few ways out of
belts near and people will sometimes say

647
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:36,280
that realism is a way
out of bell's Theorem.

648
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:40,540
That's actually not true either because
in order for realism to be a way out,

649
00:39:40,541 --> 00:39:45,220
you would need to deny the existence of
an external reality to such an extent

650
00:39:45,221 --> 00:39:49,930
that the idea of locality itself would
dissolve. So that's kind of nuts.

651
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:52,730
But another way out of Dallas
Theorem was developed, uh,

652
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:57,220
before bill did his work by a guy named
Hugh Everett who came up with what is

653
00:39:57,221 --> 00:40:01,600
now known as the many worlds
interpretation of quantum physics. Uh,

654
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:05,920
which says that no, you know, wait,
functions don't collapse. Instead,

655
00:40:05,921 --> 00:40:07,510
when you do Schrodinger's cat,

656
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:12,610
what happens is the radioactive metal
wave function gets mixed up with the wave

657
00:40:12,611 --> 00:40:15,160
function of the Geiger counter
in the cyanide in the cat.

658
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:19,600
And so now instead of a piece of radiation
that's both in the metal and not in

659
00:40:19,601 --> 00:40:23,110
the metal, you have a cat
that is both dead and alive.

660
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,850
And then when you opened the box,

661
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:28,450
you are wave function gets mixed up
with these other way functions as well.

662
00:40:28,451 --> 00:40:33,430
And now there is a copy of you looking at
a dead cat in a box and sad and a copy.

663
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:36,130
If you're looking at a living
cat in a box and happy,

664
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:40,540
I guess that you didn't kill
a cat. Um, in any event,

665
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:42,370
this is another way out of bell's Theorem.

666
00:40:42,371 --> 00:40:45,580
You can come up with a version of many
worlds that is local because bell's

667
00:40:45,581 --> 00:40:47,800
theorem assumes that you
only have one universe,

668
00:40:47,801 --> 00:40:50,620
but these are not the only
two options on the table.

669
00:40:50,621 --> 00:40:54,610
There are many other interpretations
of quantum physics available.

670
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:57,490
It's just that the Copenhagen
interpretation isn't one of them.

671
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:01,600
There are other ways of doing this
and given that there are ways of

672
00:41:01,601 --> 00:41:04,540
understanding what's
actually going on in nature,

673
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:07,750
just throwing up your hands and
saying, I give up, we can't do it.

674
00:41:07,751 --> 00:41:08,890
There's no way to understand.

675
00:41:08,891 --> 00:41:12,730
It seems both profoundly inadequate
and frankly unscientific.

676
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:15,850
But you may be left with another question,
a much,

677
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,890
much deeper and more profound question.

678
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:23,820
Who Cares if quantum physics works and
why does any of this matter and it does

679
00:41:24,821 --> 00:41:28,630
work. As I've said over and over again,
quantum physics definitely works,

680
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:31,900
so why does it matter what it's
telling us about the world?

681
00:41:31,901 --> 00:41:33,950
If we can use it to do whatever we want,

682
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:38,090
I'm going to need to appeal to
a higher authority on this one.

683
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:43,261
Now,

684
00:41:43,261 --> 00:41:48,261
another thing that people often say is
that for getting two identical theories,

685
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:55,260
theory, theory, which
look completely different,

686
00:41:55,261 --> 00:41:57,420
psychological,
different ideas in them and so on,

687
00:41:57,870 --> 00:42:00,060
but then all the
consequences that a computer,

688
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,660
all the consequence of the
computer are exactly the same.

689
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,200
Maybe replay they even agree
with it's from the head.

690
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:08,790
The point is though that the two theories,

691
00:42:08,791 --> 00:42:10,290
although they sound
different at the beginning,

692
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:12,060
have all kinds of quenches the same.

693
00:42:12,061 --> 00:42:15,780
It's easier usually to
prove that mathematically by
doing a little mathematics

694
00:42:15,781 --> 00:42:19,200
ahead of time to show that the logic from
this one and this one will always give

695
00:42:19,201 --> 00:42:22,440
corresponding consequence.
Suppose we have two such theories.

696
00:42:22,441 --> 00:42:25,710
How are we going to decide
which one is right? No Way.

697
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,550
Not by science because they both agree
with experiments. At the same extent.

698
00:42:29,551 --> 00:42:31,110
There's no way to distinguish one from me.

699
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,310
So on two theories all alone and they
have dick deeply different ideas by them,

700
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:41,540
maybe mathematically identical and they
usually people say then in science when

701
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:45,810
should pay. One doesn't know how to
distinguish him and that's right. However,

702
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:50,220
for psychological reasons,
in order to get new theories,

703
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:55,020
these two things are very far from the
film because one gives a man different

704
00:42:55,021 --> 00:42:58,980
ideas than the other. By putting the
theory in a certain kind of framework,

705
00:42:58,981 --> 00:43:00,360
you get an idea of what the chain,

706
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:04,530
which would be something printed in
theory that talks about something.

707
00:43:04,531 --> 00:43:06,300
But you say,
I'll change that idea here,

708
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:09,760
but to find out what the car is funding
thing is you're going to change in here.

709
00:43:09,761 --> 00:43:13,360
Amazing, very complicated. It may
not be a simple idea. In other words,

710
00:43:13,361 --> 00:43:17,280
just simple change here makes maybe a
very different theories and a simple

711
00:43:17,281 --> 00:43:20,820
change there. In other words, all
they are identical before that change.

712
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:24,000
There are certain ways of
changing one which looked natural,

713
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:25,710
which not look natural,
and then the other.

714
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,200
Therefore psychologically we
must keep all the theories.

715
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,850
And I had and every theoretical
physicists, it's any good. No.

716
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:35,760
It was six or seven different theoretical
representations for exactly the same

717
00:43:35,761 --> 00:43:40,761
physics and our knows that the tooth that
they're all equivalent and that nobody

718
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,370
is ever going to be able to decide
which one is right at that level,

719
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:47,100
but he keeps him in his head hoping that
they'll give them different ideas for

720
00:43:47,101 --> 00:43:52,020
guests. It's a valley. That reminds
me of another thing that is,

721
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:55,500
that's the philosophy or
the ideas around the theory.

722
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,820
A lot of ideas you say,
I believe there are,

723
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:03,420
there is a space of time or something
like that in order to discuss your

724
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:08,510
analysis at these ideas change enormously
when they were very tiny changes in

725
00:44:09,211 --> 00:44:10,810
the theory. In other words, sprinters,

726
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:15,830
Newton's ideas about space and time
agreeing with experiment very well,

727
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:20,190
but in order to get the correct
motion of the orbit of mercury,

728
00:44:20,191 --> 00:44:21,930
which was a tiny,
tiny difference.

729
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:25,800
There's a difference in the character
of the theory with which you started was

730
00:44:25,801 --> 00:44:26,311
enormous.

731
00:44:26,311 --> 00:44:30,960
Reason is these are so simple and so
perfect that produce definite results in.

732
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:33,570
If they get something that produced
a little different results could be

733
00:44:33,571 --> 00:44:36,580
completely different. You can't make
imperfections on appropriate thing.

734
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:41,670
I have another sort of philosophical
ideas between Newton's theory of

735
00:44:41,701 --> 00:44:44,490
gravitation and Einstein's theory
of gravitation are enormous.

736
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:49,710
Differences rather are enormous. What are
these philosophies? These philosophies,

737
00:44:49,711 --> 00:44:53,610
I really freaky why? He used to compute
consequences quickly. Our philosophy,

738
00:44:53,611 --> 00:44:56,430
which is sometimes called
an understanding of the law,

739
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:01,080
is simply a way that a person holds the
laws in his mind was the guest quickly a

740
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:04,740
consequences. Some people have
said, and it's true, for instance,

741
00:45:04,741 --> 00:45:08,820
in the case of Maxwell's equations and
other equations, nevermind the philosophy,

742
00:45:08,821 --> 00:45:11,400
nevermind anything of this
kind just guessed the crate.

743
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:16,350
The problem is only to compute the answer
so that I agree with experiment and

744
00:45:16,351 --> 00:45:20,010
there's not necessarily to have a
philosophy or argue or worries about the

745
00:45:20,011 --> 00:45:24,210
equation. That's true
in a sense. Yes, I know.

746
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:27,480
It's good in the sense that you may be,
if you only get the equation,

747
00:45:27,481 --> 00:45:30,840
you're not prejudice in yourself and your
guests better and the other hand maybe

748
00:45:30,841 --> 00:45:33,000
the philosophy helps you to get.
It's very hard to say

749
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,180
for those people who insist,
however,

750
00:45:36,181 --> 00:45:39,600
that the only thing that's important is
that the theory agrees with experiment.

751
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:44,840
I would like to make an imaginary
discussion between a Mayan astronomer as

752
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:49,770
students. The Mayans were
able to calculate with great
precision, great precision.

753
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,450
The predictions,
for example,

754
00:45:51,451 --> 00:45:53,790
three eclipses and the position
of the moon in the sky,

755
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:56,220
a position of Venus and side.
However,

756
00:45:56,221 --> 00:46:00,420
it was all done by a the counter certain
numbers or subtract some numbers and

757
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:03,600
song. There was no discussion
of what the moon was.

758
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,320
There wasn't even a discussion
of the idea that it went around.

759
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:10,620
There was only calculate the time when
there would be an eclipse or the time

760
00:46:10,621 --> 00:46:13,620
when it would rise.
They're full moon and when it would rise,

761
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:18,630
have one saw and just calculated only
supposedly the young man going to the

762
00:46:18,631 --> 00:46:23,220
astronomy and said, I have an idea.
Maybe those things are going around,

763
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:26,580
and then a balls of locks
was like rocks out there.

764
00:46:26,581 --> 00:46:29,400
We could calculate how they move and
a completely different way and just

765
00:46:29,401 --> 00:46:32,790
calculate what time they appeared,
the scarring.

766
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,630
So the of course the Miami
[inaudible] would say yes.

767
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:40,680
How accurate could you predict eclipses?
You said,

768
00:46:40,681 --> 00:46:42,850
I haven't developed a thing very far.
This is,

769
00:46:42,851 --> 00:46:46,290
but we can calculate equipped is more
likely than you can with your model.

770
00:46:46,291 --> 00:46:49,140
And so you must not pay any attention
to there's the mathematical scheme is

771
00:46:49,141 --> 00:46:49,740
better.

772
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:54,420
And it was very strong tendency of people
to say against some idea if someone

773
00:46:54,421 --> 00:46:55,350
comes up with an idea,

774
00:46:55,351 --> 00:46:58,320
so let's suppose the world was
this way and you say to them,

775
00:46:58,380 --> 00:46:59,280
well how would you get,

776
00:46:59,281 --> 00:47:02,760
what would you get for the answer for
such and such a problem? And he says,

777
00:47:02,761 --> 00:47:05,550
I haven't developed it far
enough. And you say, wow,

778
00:47:05,551 --> 00:47:07,170
we have already developed
that much further.

779
00:47:07,171 --> 00:47:08,910
We can get the answers very accurately.

780
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:14,820
So it is a problem as to whether or
not to worry about philosophies behind

781
00:47:14,821 --> 00:47:15,654
ideas.

782
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:20,540
So it's certainly true that you can
use whatever interpretation of quantum

783
00:47:20,541 --> 00:47:22,760
physics you like and come up
with the same predictions.

784
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:27,290
And given that there is no test
that you can perform to show which

785
00:47:27,291 --> 00:47:30,010
interpretation of quantum
physics is correct,

786
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:35,970
but the story of the world that goes
along with the theories that we have in

787
00:47:38,381 --> 00:47:42,400
science plays a big role in
the actual practice of science.

788
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:49,200
It actually influences the way that we
come up with new theories to go beyond

789
00:47:49,601 --> 00:47:53,090
the current theory. It influences, um,

790
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:58,350
what experiments we conduct and it
influences how we interpret the results of

791
00:47:58,871 --> 00:48:02,980
those experiments.
Fiman gives an example of a,

792
00:48:02,981 --> 00:48:05,920
and this is in by the way, his
book, the character of physical law,

793
00:48:05,921 --> 00:48:10,250
which is a compilation of the lectures
that I was going to play a clip from. Um,

794
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,790
Fineman,
uh,

795
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:17,020
gives the example of someone going
to a Mayan astronomer, you know,

796
00:48:17,021 --> 00:48:20,980
back when the Mayan civilization was at
its peak. Uh, and saying, look, you know,

797
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:25,090
I know we have this theory that says that,
um,

798
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,740
that that allows us to
predict when it clips,

799
00:48:26,741 --> 00:48:29,980
this will happen and when
Venus will transmit the sun
and all these other things

800
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:31,330
to phenomenal precision.

801
00:48:31,331 --> 00:48:34,630
But the theory doesn't tell us
what Venus is or what the moon is.

802
00:48:34,631 --> 00:48:38,860
I have a theory that tells us all
those things and it, and it, uh, and,

803
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:40,630
and then the Mayan astronomer says,
okay,

804
00:48:40,631 --> 00:48:44,410
but can you do the same things we can
do? And the other guy says, well, no,

805
00:48:44,411 --> 00:48:46,000
I haven't developed it fully yet.

806
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:49,000
It doesn't mean that we shouldn't
listen to the other guy. Right.

807
00:48:49,001 --> 00:48:53,050
And it doesn't mean that even if he could
get it to work just as well as my in

808
00:48:53,051 --> 00:48:55,150
astronomy, that doesn't
mean that, you know,

809
00:48:55,151 --> 00:48:58,360
there's no difference between the
choices we make in our theories.

810
00:48:58,690 --> 00:49:02,710
It matters for the progress of science
and it matters beyond just the realm of

811
00:49:02,711 --> 00:49:06,910
science as well. It matters
for the entire world. Remember,

812
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:11,470
throughout the history of humanity,
this was at least in Europe,

813
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:16,710
the dominant way of thinking about what
the universe looked like throughout most

814
00:49:16,841 --> 00:49:21,580
of human history, the earth is at the
center and everything moves around us.

815
00:49:21,581 --> 00:49:26,581
And it wasn't until Copernicus in the 15
hundreds that people started seriously

816
00:49:27,761 --> 00:49:32,020
considering the possibility that the
earth is not at the center of everything.

817
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:35,770
And without that move, without
Copernicus on the centering the earth,

818
00:49:35,771 --> 00:49:39,850
it seems unlikely that Darwin would
have had the audacity to say, yeah,

819
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:41,800
humans are not at the
center of creation either.

820
00:49:41,801 --> 00:49:45,250
We're just another part
of a giant tree of life.

821
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:50,110
And without those two insights, our entire
modern world, not just science, book,

822
00:49:50,111 --> 00:49:54,430
culture, art, movies, would
look entirely different.

823
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,880
Kubrick would never have been able to
film in 2001 not that that's, you know,

824
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:01,810
the pinnacle achievement of
humanity and the 20th century.

825
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:06,730
But I really like that movie. Uh, and, and
I think it's an important piece of art.

826
00:50:06,731 --> 00:50:10,960
And there were other very important
pieces of art, science, religion,

827
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:12,760
politics,
economics,

828
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:17,940
all of the realms of human experience
and endeavor are effected by the stories

829
00:50:18,941 --> 00:50:22,660
that we get from our science.
And in fact,

830
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:27,350
this is how we do every other piece
of science. You know, nobody says, oh,

831
00:50:27,351 --> 00:50:28,280
genes aren't

832
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:32,630
real. They're just a way of explaining
the outcomes of electron microscope

833
00:50:32,631 --> 00:50:35,930
observations and genetics experiments.
Nobody says,

834
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:39,650
or at least physicists usually
don't say spacetime isn't real.

835
00:50:39,651 --> 00:50:42,650
It's just something that helps us
understand the outcomes at Lego.

836
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:45,320
We don't say electromagnetic
fields aren't real.

837
00:50:45,321 --> 00:50:49,490
We're very willing to grant reality to
things except when it comes to quantum

838
00:50:49,491 --> 00:50:52,760
physics and the reasons for
that are largely historical.

839
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:58,640
Um, I've written a book that
is about all of this. Uh,

840
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:01,730
there were copies of the back, but it
looks like everyone's snapped them up.

841
00:51:01,731 --> 00:51:05,480
That's great. Uh, you
can buy it online. Um,

842
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:09,110
you can go find it anywhere.
Books are sold. Um,

843
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,330
and if you do that will make me
happy. I hope you enjoy it. Um,

844
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:16,310
you can get ahold of me relatively easily
if you want to ask me questions about

845
00:51:16,311 --> 00:51:17,144
anything in there.

846
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:22,360
I discuss all of this in much greater
detail in the book and the book is like

847
00:51:22,581 --> 00:51:23,570
this talk,
I hope,

848
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,560
understandable for people who
have no physics background at all.

849
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:31,260
The intended audience is just
the interested public. So, uh,

850
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:34,130
with that, thank you for
your time. Any questions?

851
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:39,553
Thanks.

852
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:44,160
I guess putting the historical, putting
things historically correct, uh,

853
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:48,630
Einstein has also attributed to this
quote of God doesn't play, you know,

854
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:53,490
it doesn't roll the die and, um, play
with the ice. And, uh, so you probably,

855
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:56,280
that might have also been taken
out of context, you know, if he,

856
00:51:56,430 --> 00:51:58,740
if he actually didn't,
his biggest problems weren't with,

857
00:51:59,070 --> 00:52:00,690
as you said that the randomness,
but yeah.

858
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:03,090
But more with this action at a distance.

859
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,480
It sounds like that quote was
also kind of out of context.

860
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:08,190
I think that's correct,

861
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,970
given that Einstein famously said that
God doesn't play dice with the universe.

862
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:13,740
Um,
you know,

863
00:52:13,741 --> 00:52:16,860
it sounds like that was taken
out of context given that
his primary problem with

864
00:52:16,861 --> 00:52:21,090
quantum physics was not
randomness. Um, I'm sorry, Alex,

865
00:52:21,091 --> 00:52:24,850
can you take the computer and do
that? Sure. Yeah. Thank you. Um,

866
00:52:25,690 --> 00:52:30,500
I can't actually go. Okay. That's fine.
Um, so yeah, I think that's right. It was,

867
00:52:30,501 --> 00:52:34,890
it's not so much that it was taken
out of context as it is that it's not,

868
00:52:34,891 --> 00:52:36,660
it was a real problem that he had.

869
00:52:36,661 --> 00:52:40,860
He did not like the randomness
of quantum physics. Um,

870
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:46,190
he just also didn't like other things
about quantum physics even more.

871
00:52:47,161 --> 00:52:48,860
I mean, he also said, you know,

872
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:52,980
I can't abide spooky action at a
distance that that got closer to his real

873
00:52:52,981 --> 00:52:53,814
problem.

874
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:58,660
And he also said some very quotable things
about his problems with the, you know,

875
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:01,960
non realism of the Copenhagen
interpretation. Um,

876
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:06,570
they're just not as well
known. And I think that that's
largely because, you know,

877
00:53:06,571 --> 00:53:10,710
the idea of God playing dice is, is
this very sort of sexy image. Um,

878
00:53:10,711 --> 00:53:12,050
and also because, you know, it,

879
00:53:12,051 --> 00:53:16,230
it conforms with this standard incorrect
narrative among physicists about the

880
00:53:16,231 --> 00:53:20,610
history of physics. I'm like, you
know, Einstein also said, uh, and I,

881
00:53:20,611 --> 00:53:23,100
I love this quote so
much. He said that, um,

882
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:28,020
regarding the Copenhagen interpretation
that it was a soft pillow, uh,

883
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:31,500
that, um, that, uh, the,

884
00:53:31,501 --> 00:53:33,660
the true believer can rest his head on,

885
00:53:33,661 --> 00:53:38,130
but it provides very little
comfort to him. Or he also
said that, you know, again,

886
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:41,280
regarding the Copenhagen interpretation
and its denial of reality,

887
00:53:41,281 --> 00:53:45,840
he said that this epistemology
fueled orgy must come to an end.

888
00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:48,990
Um, and I went and looked that
up thinking, you know, okay,

889
00:53:48,991 --> 00:53:52,560
maybe the translation from the German
took a few liberties. It's right in there.

890
00:53:52,561 --> 00:53:57,180
It's something like
epistemology or g. Uh, so yeah,

891
00:53:57,181 --> 00:54:00,780
know Einstein was, was pretty
clear about what his problem was.

892
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:02,730
It's just not been represented properly.

893
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:06,130
Yeah.
Yeah.

894
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:11,220
Let's do, uh, um, on the online question
for okay. And then we can alternate. Yep.

895
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:13,360
Okay. Sounds good. So
what's the online question?

896
00:54:13,870 --> 00:54:17,950
What are your thoughts on the
Conway Colin a freewill serum,

897
00:54:18,910 --> 00:54:22,780
which basically says that there's a finite
set of experiments such that there is

898
00:54:22,781 --> 00:54:25,750
no consistent set of possible
outcomes for all the experiments.

899
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:30,050
This is a question about my thoughts on
the Conway Coken freewill experiment.

900
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:31,670
It's a good question.
Uh,

901
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:34,760
I'm going to say something that will
probably piss off people in response.

902
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:38,990
The Conway cocaine freewill Theorem
is just an attempt to repackage bell's

903
00:54:38,991 --> 00:54:42,590
theorem along with a different
result and known as contextuality,

904
00:54:42,591 --> 00:54:45,140
which is actually also due to bell.
Uh,

905
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:49,640
it was bells demolition of von Nivens
proof that I talked about earlier. Um,

906
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:54,380
I don't think that there's anything in
there that is Indian, those two proofs.

907
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:59,740
And I think that mostly what it means
is that the area's nonlocality in nature

908
00:55:01,371 --> 00:55:05,900
or something else. One of the other
ways out of bell's theorem must be true,

909
00:55:05,901 --> 00:55:09,200
like multiple universes. Um, so yeah,

910
00:55:09,230 --> 00:55:11,090
maybe not the most
interesting response to that,

911
00:55:11,091 --> 00:55:13,700
but I actually don't find the
result terribly interesting either.

912
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:17,080
Okay.

913
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:20,790
So I find it very surprising this,

914
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:25,900
that are prominent physicists who don't
think that's what the mechanics is a

915
00:55:27,191 --> 00:55:31,870
unitary or violate something,
uh, need mathematical properties.

916
00:55:31,871 --> 00:55:35,450
It's an unlikeable. Uh,
so what words mean you,

917
00:55:35,451 --> 00:55:40,020
you've had some interesting
discussions with Peter White's, uh,

918
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:45,220
I mean it's Sabine Hudson Felder's a
prominent blogger who doesn't believe in

919
00:55:45,221 --> 00:55:47,720
the multiverse. Uh, uh,

920
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:52,040
so what did the shut up and
calculate people say happens, uh,

921
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:55,860
in the show there in gears,
cats scenario for some,

922
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,550
for a sufficiently small cat?

923
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:03,570
That's a good question.
Um, so first of all,

924
00:56:03,571 --> 00:56:07,710
let me make it clear. I am not saying,
Oh, the multiverse is definitely true.

925
00:56:07,711 --> 00:56:11,740
I am saying, I am saying, okay, good.
Yeah, no, it's a viable option, but, well,

926
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:16,170
some people don't seem to understand
that. That's what I'm saying. Um, I dunno.

927
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:21,180
I thought I'd made it pretty clear
in my book and in the dog, but um,

928
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:23,250
yeah,
I,

929
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:29,500
so you're asking what the Copenhagen
interpretation people say happens to the

930
00:56:29,501 --> 00:56:33,220
cat? Schrodinger's cat for a
sufficiently small cat. Um,

931
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,770
that's an excellent question.

932
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:40,260
I am strongly tempted to give
a very glib answer and save.

933
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:42,250
They don't say what happens to the cat.

934
00:56:42,290 --> 00:56:45,610
They don't say what happens to anything
because their interpretation is

935
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:50,200
profoundly anti realist. Um, if
I wanted to be more charitable,

936
00:56:50,201 --> 00:56:54,490
I would say you have to pick a version
of the Copenhagen interpretation.

937
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:57,880
There is no single Copenhagen
interpretation and arguably it's not an

938
00:56:57,881 --> 00:56:59,440
interpretation at all.
So it's,

939
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:03,730
the phrase of the Copenhagen
interpretation is a little
bit like the holy Roman

940
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:06,070
Empire. You know, there's, there's no the,

941
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:09,400
and there's no interpretation and
the affiliation with Copenhagen is

942
00:57:09,401 --> 00:57:14,290
questionable. But, um, but if you, if you
pick a version of Copenhagen, if you say,

943
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:17,620
okay, let's pick the version that says
quantum mechanics stops applying at a

944
00:57:17,621 --> 00:57:19,960
particular, you know, size scale,

945
00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:22,600
then the answer of what happens
to the cat is reasonably clear.

946
00:57:22,601 --> 00:57:26,110
If it's larger than that size scale
than the cat is either dead or alive.

947
00:57:26,111 --> 00:57:28,660
And if it's smaller than the
cat is both dead and alive.

948
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:31,510
If you pick a version of
Copenhagen that says no,

949
00:57:31,511 --> 00:57:34,600
it's meaningless to ask about what
happens to the cap before you look,

950
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:38,470
then the answer is we can't say what
happens to the cabinet until you look

951
00:57:38,471 --> 00:57:42,430
because it's meaningless because that's
what we said because we don't understand

952
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:46,540
philosophy of language or metaphysics
because we didn't pay attention when the

953
00:57:46,541 --> 00:57:50,620
logical positivists were taken down in the
mid 20th century. Um, but I definitely,

954
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:54,460
but then you can get an interference
pattern of cats. I agree. Yeah. No,

955
00:57:54,461 --> 00:57:56,590
you can get an interference.
The interference pattern is real.

956
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:00,340
I can't defend it because they
think it's not just wrong,

957
00:58:00,341 --> 00:58:04,720
but logically incoherent.
Um, which makes it very,

958
00:58:04,721 --> 00:58:09,370
very difficult to be, you
know, sympathetic. I have
to pick a version of it.

959
00:58:09,371 --> 00:58:13,690
And as far as I can tell,
the most reasonable version of Copenhagen,

960
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:18,340
which some people at least did believe
that some points is that there was some

961
00:58:18,341 --> 00:58:21,220
sort of split between the
classical and the quantum.

962
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:25,210
It happens either at some scale or when
it hits the brain because the brain is

963
00:58:25,211 --> 00:58:28,780
somehow exempt from the laws
of physics anyway. Yeah.

964
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:35,690
Like second under Tory
question first. Yeah. Oh, okay.

965
00:58:35,810 --> 00:58:40,490
Um, freewill is bogus and the
world is entirely deterministic.

966
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:43,070
Does,
does contradict quantum physics.

967
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:45,860
What does it mean for
there to be no causation?

968
00:58:46,730 --> 00:58:51,450
Um, okay. So the question is about whether
quantum physics is deterministic, uh,

969
00:58:51,590 --> 00:58:54,790
and,
and what it or whether you know it,

970
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:59,100
what it would mean for there to be no
causation, whether quantum physics,

971
00:58:59,101 --> 00:59:03,120
it's deterministic, depends on your
interpretation. Um, for example,

972
00:59:03,121 --> 00:59:05,790
the pilot wave interpretation
is entirely deterministic.

973
00:59:06,090 --> 00:59:08,790
The many worlds interpretation
is entirely deterministic,

974
00:59:08,791 --> 00:59:12,000
which is actually kind of a problem for
it because you need to figure out where

975
00:59:12,001 --> 00:59:14,640
the probabilities come from in
the pilot wave interpretation.

976
00:59:14,641 --> 00:59:17,370
They come from ignorance and
the many worlds interpretation,

977
00:59:17,371 --> 00:59:21,800
you need to figure out why we don't know
things because everything obeys this

978
00:59:21,801 --> 00:59:25,420
totally deterministic
Schrodinger equation. Um,

979
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:29,120
but there are people who work on that
who thinks they found solutions to it.

980
00:59:29,330 --> 00:59:32,960
It's an active area of
research. Um, nonetheless,

981
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:35,240
that's totally deterministic.
Um,

982
00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:39,110
there are proposed modifications
to quantum mechanics
that would also solve the

983
00:59:39,111 --> 00:59:41,810
measurement problem called
spontaneous collapse theories.

984
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:46,910
Those are fundamentally non-deterministic.
So it depends on what you pick.

985
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:50,840
Um, as for what it means for
things to not be deterministic,

986
00:59:50,841 --> 00:59:55,430
it means that sometimes the future of
the world is not fully specified by the

987
00:59:55,431 --> 00:59:56,390
past state of the world.

988
00:59:57,270 --> 01:00:01,730
Uh, an effort to figure out the nature of
the universe and how the universe works

989
01:00:01,970 --> 01:00:06,970
until or unless it can come up with
some kind of device that can measure or

990
01:00:07,521 --> 01:00:12,521
detect that which energy
and mass actually is.

991
01:00:12,890 --> 01:00:14,720
Because when you tear
apart both mass and energy,

992
01:00:14,721 --> 01:00:16,220
eventually you're left with nothing.

993
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:20,030
But obviously mass and energy
must be coming from something.

994
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,850
Do you think we'll ever
come up with some means

995
01:00:24,350 --> 01:00:29,350
made up of mass or energy that can detect
that which underlies mass and energy?

996
01:00:29,991 --> 01:00:31,610
Do you think that's ever possible?

997
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:36,890
Um, I think that math is
just one form of energy.

998
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:39,470
I wouldn't say that mass and energy
are two sides of the same coin.

999
01:00:39,471 --> 01:00:42,350
I would say maths is just one kind of
energy. And what's fundamental is energy.

1000
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:45,080
And that is the standard
view among most physicists.

1001
01:00:45,081 --> 01:00:48,290
And I think it's probably right,
mass as it kind of energy the same way.

1002
01:00:48,291 --> 01:00:51,110
Kinetic energy. Is it kind of energy
the same way he does it kind of? Well,

1003
01:00:51,170 --> 01:00:53,330
he doesn't kind of kinetic energy.
Um,

1004
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:58,340
the same with the potential energy is a
kind of energy. Um, I, I think that, um,

1005
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:02,900
what equals MC squared really says
is that mass is form of energy. Um,

1006
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:07,980
so yeah, I, I, I don't see a problem
there the way that you do. Okay.

1007
01:01:08,590 --> 01:01:12,110
Yup. You, uh,

1008
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:17,180
let's go back to the story.
What is consciousness?
According to quantum physics,

1009
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:22,400
I don't see a relationship. I, okay,

1010
01:01:22,401 --> 01:01:24,470
let me be less flip.
Um,

1011
01:01:24,770 --> 01:01:29,770
so I think that a lot of people like
to say that consciousness has some

1012
01:01:29,901 --> 01:01:33,890
relationship to quantum physics
because we don't fully understand what

1013
01:01:33,891 --> 01:01:37,190
consciousness is and because there's
controversy over the solution to the

1014
01:01:37,191 --> 01:01:38,030
measurement problem.

1015
01:01:38,210 --> 01:01:40,340
So if we put together the two
things that we don't understand,

1016
01:01:40,341 --> 01:01:44,300
maybe we'll get just one thing
we don't understand. Um, and,

1017
01:01:44,301 --> 01:01:48,680
and some serious physicists have at
various points proposed that consciousness

1018
01:01:48,681 --> 01:01:50,240
is the solution to the
measurement problem.

1019
01:01:50,241 --> 01:01:52,760
That it's consciousness that
collapses wave functions. Uh,

1020
01:01:52,761 --> 01:01:57,240
Eugene Vegner believe this at one
point until he was set straight. Um, I,

1021
01:01:57,241 --> 01:02:00,410
I don't think that that's correct.
I think that if that is correct,

1022
01:02:00,411 --> 01:02:04,190
we need to do a lot more work to prove
that it's correct because there are

1023
01:02:04,191 --> 01:02:08,420
definitely viable alternatives
to that on the table. Um,

1024
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:12,590
I think that if consciousness causes
collapse, we have questions like, okay,

1025
01:02:12,591 --> 01:02:16,670
what is consciousness, uh, by what
virtue is, does it cause collapse?

1026
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:19,620
What property does it have that
allows it to collapse wave functions?

1027
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:23,520
What else can collapse wave functions?
It's, it's a whole host of other problems.

1028
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:27,180
Uh, and I don't think quantum physics
itself says anything about the nature of

1029
01:02:27,181 --> 01:02:31,290
consciousness. I think that
that's, uh, what consciousness is,

1030
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:35,860
is a good question for a different field.
So,

1031
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:40,320
so I remember reading like 30 years ago
these books, uh, following up to that,

1032
01:02:40,321 --> 01:02:42,780
the dancing really masters
and the Dell of consciousness.

1033
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:47,540
And I think the whole premise of those
books was what can cause a collapse in,

1034
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:51,690
in the, in these functions. Is
that, is that basically the whole,

1035
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:54,810
that was the whole misconception of
those books that they based their entire

1036
01:02:55,810 --> 01:02:59,980
farm worker owned. The question was,
um, and, and can I ask you a followup?

1037
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,930
Which is it, while you're, what,
what does cause a collapse?

1038
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:05,340
What can cause a collapse
in, in this funk? Sure. Okay.

1039
01:03:05,341 --> 01:03:08,370
So first I realized I'd never actually
repeated the original question I just

1040
01:03:08,430 --> 01:03:11,280
answered, which was what is consciousness
according to quantum physics?

1041
01:03:11,281 --> 01:03:14,100
That's the answer you just gave.
Your question was these books,

1042
01:03:14,101 --> 01:03:16,380
the dancing really masters,
the Tao of physics,

1043
01:03:17,070 --> 01:03:19,950
was this about a misunderstanding of
what causes the collapse of the wave

1044
01:03:19,951 --> 01:03:22,470
function and then what does cause
the collapse of the wave function?

1045
01:03:23,010 --> 01:03:27,600
I think that those books were,
and did full disclaimer,

1046
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:31,410
I have not actually read both of
those books from cover to cover.

1047
01:03:31,411 --> 01:03:32,880
I flipped through them. But, um,

1048
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:37,980
I think that part of the deal with those
books is that they are interested in

1049
01:03:39,601 --> 01:03:43,110
going after these questions that were
seen as verboten for physicists by the

1050
01:03:43,111 --> 01:03:45,240
Copenhagen interpretation,
which, you know,

1051
01:03:45,241 --> 01:03:49,140
the shut up part of shut up and calculate
has this sort of moralistic sense to

1052
01:03:49,141 --> 01:03:51,220
it.
Like not only should you not ask that,

1053
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:53,190
not only don't you need
to ask these questions,

1054
01:03:53,310 --> 01:03:58,050
you shouldn't ask these questions. Good
physicists, don't ask these questions.

1055
01:03:58,051 --> 01:04:01,290
There's something wrong with you
if you ask these questions. Um,

1056
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:02,660
which is bullshit.
Um,

1057
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:06,900
but I think that these books were
motivated in part by a desire to ask those

1058
01:04:06,901 --> 01:04:08,370
questions and then they said,
okay,

1059
01:04:08,371 --> 01:04:11,430
and let's ask other questions that are
verboten to physicists. Like, you know,

1060
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:14,730
is their ESP. What about, you
know, telekinesis, you know,

1061
01:04:14,731 --> 01:04:18,750
what about the relationship between
religion and quantum physics consciousness

1062
01:04:18,751 --> 01:04:20,370
and quantum physics.
And I think, you know,

1063
01:04:20,371 --> 01:04:23,340
throwing and all that stuff
really confuses things. Um,

1064
01:04:23,910 --> 01:04:27,180
but I think that they were right to ask
the question of what's going on wave

1065
01:04:27,181 --> 01:04:29,070
function, collapse. Um,

1066
01:04:29,850 --> 01:04:34,230
I also think that they were motivated by
this sort of desire to see similarities

1067
01:04:34,231 --> 01:04:38,970
between certain religions and,
you know, quantum physics.

1068
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:41,180
Uh,
and just to,

1069
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:45,180
to talk about that for a second before
I get to your last part of the question.

1070
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:46,190
Um,

1071
01:04:46,190 --> 01:04:49,770
I think it's generally a bad idea to try
to find parallels between religion and

1072
01:04:49,830 --> 01:04:53,520
science because science has
this nasty habit of, you know,

1073
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:56,910
being refined and corrected and improve,
you know,

1074
01:04:56,911 --> 01:04:59,430
wrong or scientific
theories get overturned.

1075
01:04:59,431 --> 01:05:04,431
So if you try to latch your religious
philosophy onto a particular scientific

1076
01:05:04,441 --> 01:05:04,711
truth,

1077
01:05:04,711 --> 01:05:07,170
there's a good chance that your religious
philosophy is going to go down the

1078
01:05:07,171 --> 01:05:12,090
toilet when that truth is found to be
not quite true or completely wrong. Um,

1079
01:05:12,091 --> 01:05:12,621
so I,

1080
01:05:12,621 --> 01:05:16,140
I'm not very sympathetic to that project
and I don't think that people who like

1081
01:05:16,141 --> 01:05:21,100
religion should be either, um, anyway. Um,

1082
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:25,840
as for what actually causes the
collapse of the wave function, I dunno,

1083
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:28,570
I don't even know if wave functions
do collapse if they don't collapse.

1084
01:05:28,571 --> 01:05:32,620
We live in many worlds or we have
something like pilot wave theory where

1085
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:36,070
collapses
not it's,

1086
01:05:36,071 --> 01:05:39,150
it's something that's sort of
relative to other stuff. It's,

1087
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:40,660
it's more complicated than that.

1088
01:05:40,690 --> 01:05:44,140
Or we have something like a spontaneous
collapse theory where collapse is a real

1089
01:05:44,141 --> 01:05:47,130
objective thing that happens at random.
Um,

1090
01:05:47,170 --> 01:05:49,900
we're one of the other options
so I don't know what causes it,

1091
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:54,550
but either wave function
collapses happening or
something is causing it to look

1092
01:05:54,551 --> 01:05:58,240
like wave function collapses happening
and figuring out what's going on.

1093
01:05:58,241 --> 01:06:01,960
There is a legitimate area
of scientific inquiry, uh,

1094
01:06:02,110 --> 01:06:04,550
called foundations of quantum physics.
Um,

1095
01:06:04,930 --> 01:06:08,350
that still has a bad reputation among
physicists. Even to this day though,

1096
01:06:08,351 --> 01:06:09,610
it's less bad than it used to be.

1097
01:06:10,070 --> 01:06:14,250
You mentioned, um, I, I've heard
you mentioned many times that um,

1098
01:06:14,490 --> 01:06:17,530
there's sort of this big split between,
um,

1099
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:23,120
physicists and philosophers of physics
because physicists don't know any

1100
01:06:24,061 --> 01:06:28,670
philosophy yup. While philosophers of
physics, no, a lot of physics. Yes.

1101
01:06:28,770 --> 01:06:33,180
Uh, I'm, I'm also thinking of, I think I'm
probably going to misquote it, quote by,

1102
01:06:33,181 --> 01:06:37,590
uh, I think it might be some modern
philosopher, might be Dan Dennett.

1103
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:41,940
I Dunno who said something like, you know,
there's no science without philosophy.

1104
01:06:41,941 --> 01:06:45,900
There's only science wit unexamined
philosophy or something like that,

1105
01:06:46,230 --> 01:06:48,850
which I'll play something
then it would say. And so I,

1106
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,320
I thought maybe you might
want to comment on like,

1107
01:06:52,650 --> 01:06:57,270
why is it that physicist during the,
when he philosophy anymore, at least

1108
01:06:57,370 --> 01:06:58,510
there's a very good question.

1109
01:06:58,511 --> 01:07:02,920
So the question is about why physicists
mostly don't seem to know philosophy,

1110
01:07:02,921 --> 01:07:04,420
but philosophers of physics,
you know,

1111
01:07:04,421 --> 01:07:07,270
the serious ones tend to be
very well schooled in physics.

1112
01:07:07,271 --> 01:07:12,271
Many of them have undergraduate or even
PhDs in philosophy or in physics as well

1113
01:07:12,671 --> 01:07:15,370
as philosophy. Um, yeah,

1114
01:07:15,371 --> 01:07:18,280
there's definitely an asymmetry there
where the philosophers know much more

1115
01:07:18,281 --> 01:07:22,210
physics than the physicists know
philosophy. Um, as a physicist,

1116
01:07:22,211 --> 01:07:26,560
I'm interested in asymmetries.
Um, so yeah, I think,

1117
01:07:27,190 --> 01:07:29,610
uh, I think that, um,

1118
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:34,240
basically this is,

1119
01:07:34,270 --> 01:07:38,770
this is due to a variety of
historical and cultural factors.

1120
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:43,420
Um, I think that, I think that that quote,

1121
01:07:43,421 --> 01:07:45,840
whether it's Dan Dennett or
whoever who said that, uh,

1122
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:49,960
it's definitely true that physicists
engage in philosophy all the time while

1123
01:07:49,961 --> 01:07:53,770
doing philosophy or while doing
physics. It's just part of it. Um,

1124
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:58,360
and, and then the question is, okay,
you know, why don't they admit that?

1125
01:07:58,360 --> 01:07:59,560
Why don't they look at this?
Well,

1126
01:07:59,561 --> 01:08:02,530
philosophy has a bit of a bad
reputation among physicists,

1127
01:08:02,531 --> 01:08:06,700
so why does it have a bad reputation?
That's a hard question to answer.

1128
01:08:06,701 --> 01:08:11,080
I think part of it has to do with those
same factors at work after World War II

1129
01:08:11,081 --> 01:08:16,081
where academia and just got flooded with
more people and this led to a sort of

1130
01:08:16,610 --> 01:08:20,840
balkanization of academia and the walls
kind of went up between departments.

1131
01:08:20,841 --> 01:08:24,170
It used to be that physicists generally
had some schooling in philosophy.

1132
01:08:24,171 --> 01:08:27,860
Now that's not necessary. I'm
not saying that, you know,

1133
01:08:27,890 --> 01:08:30,230
we should go back to the good
old days are plenty of problems,

1134
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:34,180
but I do think that a liberal arts
education is quite valuable, uh,

1135
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:36,440
for doing almost anything.
Um,

1136
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:41,450
but I think that due to that,
you know,

1137
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:45,800
that sort of set of boundaries between
academic disciplines that has made it

1138
01:08:45,801 --> 01:08:48,170
easy for physicists to be
ignorant of philosophy.

1139
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:50,840
And then it's easy for
misconceptions about philosophy.

1140
01:08:50,841 --> 01:08:52,160
Like it doesn't make progress.

1141
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:54,170
They just asked the same
questions over and over again.

1142
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:58,310
They're not like us physicists, you know,
uh, that, that kind of thing to show up.

1143
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:01,880
Um, philosophers also have a habit
of asking very annoying questions.

1144
01:09:01,881 --> 01:09:05,250
This is a long and proud tradition
going back to Socrates. Um,

1145
01:09:05,330 --> 01:09:10,100
though most of us don't have to, you know,
drink hemlock as a result. Um, but, uh,

1146
01:09:10,130 --> 01:09:10,431
you know,

1147
01:09:10,431 --> 01:09:14,210
one way of dismissing annoying questions
is to say that the people who ask the

1148
01:09:14,211 --> 01:09:18,560
knowing questions are stupid and don't
need to be listened to, you know,

1149
01:09:18,830 --> 01:09:22,760
or you make them drink hemlock.
So, um, but that's, that's,

1150
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:27,830
that's another thing. Um, I think that
there are some philosophers who are,

1151
01:09:28,310 --> 01:09:32,710
let's say, skeptical of
scientific progress. Um,

1152
01:09:32,930 --> 01:09:37,930
this has to do with a split
within philosophy between
analytic and continental

1153
01:09:38,931 --> 01:09:41,930
philosophy,
which is a whole other thing.

1154
01:09:42,230 --> 01:09:47,060
And those names are incidentally
not relevant at all to
what those fields study.

1155
01:09:47,061 --> 01:09:51,830
They're just historical artifacts. Um,
but continental philosophy tends to,

1156
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:57,640
you know, um, be a little bit more
skeptical of authority in any form and,

1157
01:09:57,710 --> 01:10:00,110
and in many ways, rightly so. Uh,

1158
01:10:00,111 --> 01:10:03,020
and it tends to ask questions
about scientific authority,

1159
01:10:03,021 --> 01:10:08,021
which if you interpret them naively or
figure a bad continental philosopher can

1160
01:10:08,151 --> 01:10:09,770
lead to people saying things like,
Oh,

1161
01:10:09,771 --> 01:10:12,890
science is just as good as any other way
of, you know, trying to solve problems.

1162
01:10:12,891 --> 01:10:16,640
And that's some bullshit and scientist
who'd be rightly dismissive of that.

1163
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:19,250
And then they might lump all
other philosophers and with that.

1164
01:10:19,251 --> 01:10:21,410
But that's just a guess on my part.
Um,

1165
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:26,450
so I think that basically philosophy has
a very bad reputation for a variety of

1166
01:10:26,451 --> 01:10:31,370
reasons. Um, it used to not, um,

1167
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:35,660
you know, uh, boarded, read
too much content, but it's
better than reading nothing.

1168
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:40,850
Um, Einstein read a lot of
Ma and Leiden. It's and, uh,

1169
01:10:40,851 --> 01:10:44,720
and uh,
Espinosa and other great philosophers.

1170
01:10:45,650 --> 01:10:50,420
Hume in particular.
Um, yeah, I think that,

1171
01:10:50,421 --> 01:10:53,420
um, I think we have, it's a real
shame that that asymmetry is there.

1172
01:10:53,421 --> 01:10:57,030
I think that philosophers of physics
have a lot to teach physicists and,

1173
01:10:57,031 --> 01:10:59,810
and have a lot of value to offer.
Um,

1174
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:04,260
and I think it's really awful
when prominent scientists, um,

1175
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:08,270
say stupid things about philosophy,
which happens more often than it should.

1176
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:10,100
So the next question is,

1177
01:11:10,101 --> 01:11:14,000
what about the success of Quantum
electrodynamics and predicting? Um,

1178
01:11:14,910 --> 01:11:19,080
I mean, it seems like your answer
is the past hour long talk, roughly.

1179
01:11:20,130 --> 01:11:23,970
Yeah. So, so the, the, the success of
quantum electrodynamics yeah, absolutely.

1180
01:11:23,971 --> 01:11:27,120
Quantum electrodynamics and quantum
field theories in general are extremely

1181
01:11:27,121 --> 01:11:31,950
successful on not debating the success
of quantum physics. It absolutely works.

1182
01:11:32,190 --> 01:11:36,000
It's just an incomplete picture of what's
going on in the world and throwing in

1183
01:11:36,001 --> 01:11:37,680
quantum field theory as opposed to just,
you know,

1184
01:11:37,681 --> 01:11:41,190
Vanilla quantum mechanics doesn't fix the
problem. If anything, it makes it worse.

1185
01:11:41,191 --> 01:11:43,080
You know, uh, some people will say, Oh,

1186
01:11:43,081 --> 01:11:46,500
quantum field theory definitely gets you
around bell's Theorem because quantum

1187
01:11:46,501 --> 01:11:50,550
field theories designed to be
compatible with special relativity. Uh,

1188
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:52,940
there are these things called
the Comutation relations that,

1189
01:11:52,941 --> 01:11:57,600
that sort of ensure this,
um, relationship. Uh, no,

1190
01:11:57,690 --> 01:12:01,410
that doesn't solve the problem at all
because you still have the problem of wave

1191
01:12:01,411 --> 01:12:05,520
function collapse in quantum field theory
and that is subject to bell's Theorem

1192
01:12:05,521 --> 01:12:08,580
and that does not get solved
by the Comutation relations.

1193
01:12:08,581 --> 01:12:12,390
And this is a massive misunderstanding
that still persist among physicists.

1194
01:12:12,690 --> 01:12:15,510
And that's just a mathematical mistake.
That's just an error.

1195
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,910
Quantum field theory
doesn't solve this problem.

1196
01:12:18,330 --> 01:12:21,900
A quantum field theory also has other
problems. It works incredibly well,

1197
01:12:21,901 --> 01:12:24,570
but it also has its own
unique issues, you know, that,

1198
01:12:24,571 --> 01:12:28,530
that mathematicians worry about like
renormalization or something called hugs

1199
01:12:28,531 --> 01:12:33,240
theory in which don't get me
started. Um, yeah. Uh, anyway,

1200
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:36,880
so yeah, I mean quantum field
theory is great. I love it. Uh,

1201
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:40,080
it is a wonderful theory. It
doesn't solve these problems. Okay.

1202
01:12:40,110 --> 01:12:43,770
We have time for one more question.
So I think since you haven't had time,

1203
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,670
just follow up to your previous answer,
um,

1204
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:51,820
s without speculating about why this
is to have a bad image of philosophy.

1205
01:12:52,231 --> 01:12:55,800
Can you, from your research
pinpoint when this attitude,

1206
01:12:55,850 --> 01:13:00,480
like when did [inaudible] start to have
a bad image of philosophy and since

1207
01:13:00,481 --> 01:13:02,140
you're a physicist and philosopher,
yeah.

1208
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:04,500
Can you give us your
attitude towards philosophy,

1209
01:13:04,710 --> 01:13:06,570
noting that your answer
doesn't need to be monolithic.

1210
01:13:06,890 --> 01:13:09,550
Is there some part of philosophy that
you think is, was worth worthwhile?

1211
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:11,950
I don't know exactly
when the split happened.

1212
01:13:11,951 --> 01:13:14,020
I don't think it's something
that happened all at once.

1213
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:17,860
I think that World War II has a lot
to do with it, which is, you know,

1214
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:20,130
in a way kind of boring answer,
you know,

1215
01:13:20,131 --> 01:13:23,860
and like one of the central events of
the 20th century had a lot of effects.

1216
01:13:23,861 --> 01:13:28,250
You know, that's, that's a somewhat boring
answer, but, um, but yeah, I mean we're,

1217
01:13:28,251 --> 01:13:30,320
we're two really changed
the way that academia works.

1218
01:13:30,340 --> 01:13:34,450
It really moved the center of
physics from Germany to the US,

1219
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:39,850
the US already habit tradition of much
more pragmatic approaches to the sciences,

1220
01:13:40,390 --> 01:13:45,310
um, which, you know, uh, that's going to
make philosophy look yes, less useful.

1221
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:50,170
Um, there was also this school of
thought called logical positivism,

1222
01:13:50,171 --> 01:13:54,130
which was very influential in the
first half of the 20th century.

1223
01:13:54,550 --> 01:13:58,540
And then, uh, and it was
also a school of thought,

1224
01:13:58,541 --> 01:14:01,240
which was dismissive of
certain kinds of philosophy.

1225
01:14:01,630 --> 01:14:06,630
And then around the time that physics
and philosophy kind of decoupled around

1226
01:14:07,961 --> 01:14:09,340
the end of World War Two,

1227
01:14:09,610 --> 01:14:13,060
that was also the beginning of
the decline of logical positivism,

1228
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:17,560
even among philosophers
who were sympathetic to the
aims of the positivists.

1229
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:22,570
And so by the time positivism was
sort of fully discredited, um,

1230
01:14:22,690 --> 01:14:27,600
this asis couldn't really get the memo
and still use a lot of positivist aish

1231
01:14:27,610 --> 01:14:30,820
arguments, really knockoff
positivist arguments like, oh,

1232
01:14:30,821 --> 01:14:34,240
it's meaningless to talk about
things that you can't see. The,

1233
01:14:34,290 --> 01:14:38,140
would use those arguments to dismiss most
of philosophy when in fact philosophy

1234
01:14:38,141 --> 01:14:42,940
is it, you know, decades old
counter arguments explaining
why that doesn't work.

1235
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:44,800
And when you present those to physicists,

1236
01:14:44,801 --> 01:14:49,400
they will sort of the sort of stare at
you slack jawed like, wow, how did you,

1237
01:14:49,430 --> 01:14:52,130
you know, did you come up
with that yourself? That
seems very profound and think,

1238
01:14:52,150 --> 01:14:56,410
know that argument is older than
both of us combined. Um, so,

1239
01:14:56,920 --> 01:15:00,880
um, so yeah, as for my take on philosophy,

1240
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:05,940
I think that in general it is usually a
bad idea to dismiss almost any area of

1241
01:15:08,501 --> 01:15:13,270
serious academic inquiry. There
are exceptions, um, such as,

1242
01:15:13,271 --> 01:15:16,360
you know, evolutionary
psychology. But, um,

1243
01:15:17,830 --> 01:15:22,630
uh, but, but, uh, um, I like
psychology, evolutionary psychology.

1244
01:15:22,690 --> 01:15:26,290
Um, um, but, uh,

1245
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:30,370
but I think that most of philosophy
has something worthwhile.

1246
01:15:30,371 --> 01:15:32,350
I think philosophy of physics in,

1247
01:15:32,351 --> 01:15:37,090
in the analytic tradition has done a
lot of really great work in particular

1248
01:15:37,091 --> 01:15:41,140
because it's gone after these questions
that physicists have largely ignored. Um,

1249
01:15:41,141 --> 01:15:42,440
but I also think that,
you know,

1250
01:15:42,460 --> 01:15:46,060
philosophy of science really helps to
clear up a lot of misunderstandings that

1251
01:15:46,061 --> 01:15:49,990
are prom, like prevalent among scientists
of all stripes about how science works.

1252
01:15:49,991 --> 01:15:54,991
There are some naive ideas there that
philosophers have helped to sort of kick

1253
01:15:55,401 --> 01:15:59,590
to the curb. Um, I think that,

1254
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:06,790
I think that if you think that you
have a simple answer to a deep question

1255
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:09,250
talking to a philosopher
for a few minutes,

1256
01:16:09,251 --> 01:16:12,190
it will usually tell you that
you're wrong. And I think that,

1257
01:16:12,191 --> 01:16:15,340
that it's good to experience being wrong.

1258
01:16:15,670 --> 01:16:18,400
I think depends on an important
part of the human experience.

1259
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:22,990
And I think that it's good to think
deeply about strange questions.

1260
01:16:23,410 --> 01:16:26,830
Um, and I think that the questions
philosophers tend to ask,

1261
01:16:26,831 --> 01:16:29,440
and this might be another sore
like source of the problem,

1262
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:33,130
philosophers will ask questions that
sound like they have obvious answers to

1263
01:16:33,131 --> 01:16:38,080
scientists. Like, okay, you
know, um, what is a physical law?

1264
01:16:39,310 --> 01:16:43,180
Okay. You know that that
doesn't seem interesting and
it seems obvious. And then,

1265
01:16:43,181 --> 01:16:46,240
you know, they go on about it for five
minutes and I go, okay, you know, yeah,

1266
01:16:46,241 --> 01:16:48,430
I see what they're asking,
but I think there's an easy answer.

1267
01:16:48,431 --> 01:16:51,160
And then they go on about it for 10 more
minutes and you realize you don't even

1268
01:16:51,161 --> 01:16:54,150
know where the hell you are
anymore. Um, and I mean,

1269
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:56,770
I think that that's a really
good experience to have.

1270
01:16:56,770 --> 01:16:58,450
I think it's good to understand,
wait,

1271
01:16:58,451 --> 01:17:01,180
these things that we take for granted
might be way more complicated than we

1272
01:17:01,181 --> 01:17:01,960
think.

1273
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:06,960
And there is also a long and proud
tradition in science of doing science and

1274
01:17:07,601 --> 01:17:10,340
damn the torpedoes, you
know, forget, you know,

1275
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:12,710
the philosophical or
mathematical foundations.

1276
01:17:12,711 --> 01:17:16,910
I'm not even saying that shut up and
calculate was always the wrong approach.

1277
01:17:17,060 --> 01:17:20,480
It's certainly not the case that every
single physicist should be thinking about

1278
01:17:20,481 --> 01:17:24,530
quantum foundations all the time. It's
just that moralistic thing of, no,

1279
01:17:24,531 --> 01:17:28,760
you should shut up and calculate.
A good physicist shuts up and calculates.

1280
01:17:29,630 --> 01:17:31,220
That's some bullshit. You know, the,

1281
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:33,620
these questions are
legitimate parts of science,

1282
01:17:34,010 --> 01:17:37,730
and the boundary between
science and philosophy is,

1283
01:17:37,731 --> 01:17:42,620
and always has been permeable, um, just
as it is between any two disciplines.

1284
01:17:43,490 --> 01:17:47,150
And, um, yeah, it's been a
pleasure and thank you, all
of you for coming. Thank you.

1285
01:17:49,350 --> 01:17:50,450
[inaudible].
