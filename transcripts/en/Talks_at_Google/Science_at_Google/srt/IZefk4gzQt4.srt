1
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,300
Please put your hands
together for Daniel Dennett

2
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:19,200
can, can I ask how slice to
be put up a, I'm not an actor.

3
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:24,120
I'm a professor. I liked it. I
liked to see the students' eyes.

4
00:00:24,121 --> 00:00:26,520
I like to see the audience reactions.

5
00:00:26,521 --> 00:00:29,880
I feel very uncomfortable
if I can't do that. Okay.

6
00:00:29,881 --> 00:00:34,620
So my new book is called from
bacteria to Bach and back. And

7
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,830
let's see, oh yeah, turn
it on. All his helps.

8
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,430
That's a bacterium and that's buck.

9
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,520
And I'm going to say a
little bit about them,

10
00:00:47,521 --> 00:00:51,910
but mainly today I'm going to talk about
back cause that's what you folks come

11
00:00:51,911 --> 00:00:56,220
in. Yes, Google actually is uh,

12
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,430
not just mentioned in the book but uh,

13
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,610
discussed a little bit in the last
chapter. So we'll get to that.

14
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,050
But first I have to give a sort of
swift review of how I got there.

15
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,590
So here's the great tree of life.

16
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,030
This is my favorite diagram.
I just realized there's all these screens.

17
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:19,130
I can't use my, my laser pointer.
So I have to use the, um,

18
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,620
cursor here. Aha. Here we are. So if you,

19
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,250
this is the present out here at the
outer edge and this is the origin of life

20
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,560
here.
So time goes this way.

21
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,750
Everything that's alive
on the planet today,

22
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,960
there's somewhere out there on that
fringe and you can see how it started with

23
00:01:43,171 --> 00:01:47,130
the archaea and the bacteria.
And then you had this amazing event.

24
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,170
This was the, you carry Arctic
Revolution, the endosymbiosis,

25
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,540
the creative that you carry.
Odic sell

26
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:01,430
the first great technology transfer
to independent simple cells,

27
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,070
bumped into each other and
instead of one eating the other,

28
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,330
they joined forces and
it just happened to work.

29
00:02:09,331 --> 00:02:13,770
And thus was the eukaryotic cell born
and everything that's alive that's big

30
00:02:13,771 --> 00:02:17,220
enough to see with the naked eye is a,
you carry out where are you carry outs.

31
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:22,590
So were pine trees and whales
and birds and everything else.

32
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:27,980
Everything else except for
bacteria and some other protests.

33
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,340
So this huge colorful fan out all the
sequel to chance event that happened,

34
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,460
uh,
several billion years ago.

35
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,540
And then here is another familiar feature.

36
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:49,620
You may have heard of the
Cambrian explosion over a
relatively short period of

37
00:02:49,621 --> 00:02:51,780
time,
a few million years,

38
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:57,270
relatively short by evolutionary biology,
biology standards.

39
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:02,140
You had a tremendous creative
burst of new designs,

40
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:06,280
novelty, and of course along with the
creativity when a lot of destruction,

41
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,290
mass extinctions along with the,
it wasn't a tremendous arms race.

42
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,940
I'll have more to say about that later.

43
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:18,930
And so then over way over here somewhere
we have the mammals and let's just a

44
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,050
look a little bit larger at the mammals
and let's look at even a little bit

45
00:03:23,051 --> 00:03:26,530
larger.
And if we look,

46
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,710
see that little y there right there,

47
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,280
that's about 6 million years each leg.

48
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,600
So that could be the chimps and Bonobos
on one leg, enough on the other.

49
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:43,110
That's how recent hominids are us
and and modern homosapiens of course,

50
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:47,680
it's much more recent still.
So there we are,

51
00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:51,940
just that just a tiny little
twig on the tree of life.

52
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:53,200
So there's the tree of life.

53
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,520
And I like that particular diagram because
it helps us to visualize the history

54
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:07,510
of life on the planet as a history of
r and d of a research and development.

55
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,153
Um,

56
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:15,700
it's a design process that exploits
information in the environment to create,

57
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,580
maintain,
and improve the design of things.

58
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:23,870
I do not shrink from talking
about design by evolution.

59
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,680
I think it's a mistake of evolutionary
biologist say we're not going to talk

60
00:04:27,681 --> 00:04:32,120
about design because that gives aid and
comfort to the ID intelligent design

61
00:04:32,121 --> 00:04:35,300
crowd. No, the, the,

62
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,560
the brilliant designs of evolution,

63
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,160
if that isn't designed nothing is because
it outstrips human design often by,

64
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:49,640
by many degrees. Uh, let's agree.

65
00:04:49,641 --> 00:04:53,990
It's designed without an intelligent
designer. That's Darwin's idea.

66
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:01,210
I have more to say about that. Well, R
and d takes time and energy as you know.

67
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,900
And there were two main varieties.

68
00:05:04,901 --> 00:05:09,901
There's evolution by natural selection
and then there's human intelligent

69
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:15,550
design, low lower case. I lower case d.

70
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,290
Ours are intelligence designers.
The rum is full of them.

71
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:25,000
You were intelligent designers
and you're not alone.

72
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,280
And there had been intelligent
designers for quite a while,

73
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,790
but not for millions of views there.

74
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:35,791
I've only been intelligent designers
for a hundred thousand years,

75
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:41,590
which is just barely visible
on the map of the tree of life.

76
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,450
We're a very,
very,

77
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:48,510
very recent development and if we read
back features of our own intelligent

78
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:53,710
design into nature at our peril,

79
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:58,890
there are very important lessons to learn
about that effort to reverse engineer

80
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:02,180
nature. And I, I indulge
in it throughout the book,

81
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:05,920
but there are things you have to be
careful about because the process is

82
00:06:05,921 --> 00:06:10,310
different. Fundamental ways.
Evolution of course is purposeless.

83
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:13,670
Foresight lists extremely costly,

84
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:19,420
trillions and trillions and quadrillions
of poor organisms die childless.

85
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:24,990
Okay.

86
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:28,680
Oh, 99% of everything that's
ever lived, died, childless,

87
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:35,710
an awful lot of waste.
And of course it's slow.

88
00:06:35,711 --> 00:06:40,420
It takes billions of years.
Contrast that with intelligent design,

89
00:06:40,421 --> 00:06:43,480
which is purposeful goal directed.

90
00:06:43,481 --> 00:06:46,030
It's somewhat four sided.

91
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:51,990
Why does foresighted is it often thinks
it is and of course it's governed by

92
00:06:52,061 --> 00:06:54,640
cost considerations as you all know.
Well,

93
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:56,870
okay.

94
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:59,780
And it's usually relatively fast.

95
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,740
Even though,
as you also know,

96
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,920
particularly in the world of software,

97
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,040
projects always take
longer than you expect,

98
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:13,010
even when you expect them to
take longer than you expect.

99
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:21,540
So evolution may be slow and costly,
but it is brilliant.

100
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:24,983
Uh,

101
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:29,400
the late great Sir Francis
Crick once made a joke about it,

102
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:34,440
a teasing in a way his colleague Leslie
or goal by calling it [inaudible] second

103
00:07:34,441 --> 00:07:37,050
rule evolution. That's
clever. And you are,

104
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,100
and what he meant is not he,

105
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:45,300
nobody on earth would ever be less
likely to be a supporter of ID,

106
00:07:45,301 --> 00:07:50,040
intelligent design. Then Francis
Crick, that was not his point.

107
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:55,020
His point is that the process of
natural selection though mindless,

108
00:07:55,021 --> 00:07:58,890
purposeless without imagination.
Nevertheless,

109
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:03,480
it produces designs that are more cunning,

110
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,430
more devious,

111
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:09,420
and more efficient than most
human beings can imagine.

112
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,580
That's what he meant.

113
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,890
So intelligent design now exists,
as I say,

114
00:08:16,891 --> 00:08:21,450
the room is this where
we are sitting in a,

115
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:25,440
in a veritable castle
of intelligent design

116
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,160
and it's becoming ever more intelligent.

117
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,640
And a lot of you can take
some credit for that too.

118
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,630
And this has some surprising implications.

119
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,210
Okay.

120
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:40,710
Here's an interesting comparison.

121
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,953
Yeah.

122
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:43,960
On the left,

123
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:49,710
you see an Australian termite
castle on the right you see Goudis,

124
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,430
famous Barcelona church Sagrada Familia.

125
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,440
They're remarkably similar in overall
shape and structure and material.

126
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,750
And even the interior design.

127
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:07,320
There are many features and com it
says sort of breathtakingly interesting

128
00:09:07,321 --> 00:09:11,100
comparison.
So the end product is dry.

129
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,420
They're strikingly similar.

130
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:17,660
But the processes by which these products
have been made are hugely different.

131
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,050
These are my exemplars of a point.
I want a contrast.

132
00:09:22,051 --> 00:09:27,051
I want to stress the termite
castle is made by termites,

133
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,340
millions of them.

134
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:33,510
And in a word they're clueless.

135
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,770
They don't know what they're doing,
they don't know why they're doing it.

136
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,110
There's no boss termites, there's no
architect, termites, there's no, uh,

137
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,640
subcontractors and contractors.

138
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,810
They all just doing their
little local mindless jobs.

139
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:54,960
And amazingly the termite castle with
many outstanding design features like air

140
00:09:58,111 --> 00:10:02,640
conditioning, uh, emerges from,

141
00:10:02,641 --> 00:10:07,641
they're very competent but
clueless behavior Goudy.

142
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:09,000
On the other hand,

143
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,720
it was just perfect for my purposes
cause he's the archetypal charismatic,

144
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,760
mad genius Eero,

145
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:23,540
the top down king of design who had
blueprints and manifestos and proof of

146
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:30,891
concept and and it was all planned
out in advance and he lord it over his

147
00:10:32,311 --> 00:10:36,510
assistance who Lord it over
their assistance, who lorded
over their assistance,

148
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:40,380
who lorded it over the brick layers
and stone cutters and others who built.

149
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:45,620
So we have Goudy as an exemplar of
cop down design and the termites as an

150
00:10:49,201 --> 00:10:51,680
exemplar of bottom up design.

151
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:57,060
I think that's pretty clear.
Now here's a puzzle.

152
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,800
We have bottom up design
and we have top down design.

153
00:11:01,801 --> 00:11:03,210
I'm just giving you some examples.

154
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:08,780
Now a termite colony might be as many
as say 70 million clueless termites,

155
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,880
a brain latest count,
86 billion,

156
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,100
even more clueless neurons.

157
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,440
Your brain is much more like a termite
colony. The new might like to think

158
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:31,530
there's no boss, there's no boss
Neuron, there's no head architect,

159
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:36,660
there's no lieutenants
and captains and generals.

160
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,190
Just 86 billion,

161
00:11:39,191 --> 00:11:44,191
a little mindless neurons and doing their
thing and having even less knowhow and

162
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,620
versatility in many ways.
Then then the termites.

163
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,400
Okay,

164
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,780
so now here's the question.

165
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,800
How do you get a gouty type mind
out of a termite colony? Brands?

166
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:02,690
I think it's obvious to
everybody that a termite colony,

167
00:12:02,691 --> 00:12:06,200
wonderful though they are.
They're never going to write any poems.

168
00:12:06,201 --> 00:12:08,840
They're not going to have
a new form of government.

169
00:12:08,841 --> 00:12:10,100
They're not going to build ships.

170
00:12:10,101 --> 00:12:13,910
They're not going to do any of a
kazillion things that we've done,

171
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,930
and yet the whole column me,
how's it structure,

172
00:12:18,931 --> 00:12:23,130
which is not all that different
from the structure of our brains.

173
00:12:23,131 --> 00:12:27,300
The neurons are semi autonomous,
quite independent.

174
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:32,900
They live their own little lives and they
grow up around in their local spaces,

175
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,700
not unlike termites. So there's
the puzzle. Now, what's the answer?

176
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,700
Well,
the short answer,

177
00:12:41,701 --> 00:12:45,660
which is nicely been put by a former
student of mine, bulldog album,

178
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:50,850
you can't do much carpentry with your
bare hands and you can't do much thinking

179
00:12:50,851 --> 00:12:51,780
with your bare brain.

180
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:58,220
You're bear brand is like a termite
colony. It can't too much thinking.

181
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,100
It's very competent at some things,

182
00:13:01,101 --> 00:13:05,390
but it can't do much thinking and it
can't because it doesn't have the thinking

183
00:13:05,391 --> 00:13:09,020
tools.
A termite colony is a bear brain.

184
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,920
Intelligent designers have well equipped
brains equipped with thinking tools.

185
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:21,790
Where did they get their tools?
Well,

186
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,050
the wrong answer,

187
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:29,730
this from Freeman Dyson technology is
a gift of God after the gift of life.

188
00:13:31,151 --> 00:13:33,340
It is perhaps the greatest of God's gifts.

189
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:37,030
Who is the mother of civilizations
of Arts and sciences?

190
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:41,890
The Freeman is a sweet man.
The passengers I'm quoting,

191
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,980
the first sentence is false and the
rest of that, I think that's true.

192
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:51,920
So we have to replace that first
sentence with something more plausible,

193
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:57,150
something more naturalistic.
So if that's the wrong answer,

194
00:13:57,151 --> 00:14:02,020
here's the long answer.
Cultural Evolution,

195
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,260
cultural evolution,

196
00:14:06,261 --> 00:14:11,261
the process of natural
selection of cultural items,

197
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:16,550
design thinking tools that imposing
novel structures on our brains.

198
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,280
What happened over not billions of years,

199
00:14:22,281 --> 00:14:26,870
but only over thousands of years.
It was cultural evolution is very fast,

200
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:33,190
is that virtual machines we're evolved
that could travel and spread and be

201
00:14:34,461 --> 00:14:39,461
installed on different brains giving
those brands powers they otherwise didn't

202
00:14:40,161 --> 00:14:44,750
have.
Or as I like to put it,

203
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:48,140
there are apps that we
download into our neck tops

204
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:54,200
and I mean that almost literally

205
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,680
our basic mammalian brains

206
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:05,360
or like a computer without
even an operating system
or with only a rudimentary

207
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:10,620
operating system.
And then we pile in the apps

208
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:15,250
and many apps depending on other apps,
which depending on other apps,

209
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:19,180
and in the end you have a multi competent

210
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:25,890
entity that can do things that
the bear brain can't do by itself.

211
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,223
Okay.

212
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,730
And that's the power,
the source of our power and versatility.

213
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,660
Well that's the long answer,
but very shortly put,

214
00:15:35,661 --> 00:15:40,310
I want to know spell it out in a little
more detail because I want to highlight

215
00:15:40,311 --> 00:15:43,130
a few of the important
features of this idea,

216
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:47,660
which many people find
shocking and repugnant.

217
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,400
And I want to acknowledge that and
expose it so we can move on from that.

218
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:58,150
So we have to go back to my favorite
passage from a critic of Darwin's who

219
00:15:58,551 --> 00:16:01,430
talked about Darwin.
Strange inversion of reasoning.

220
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:05,390
I read this over the years.
Many times.

221
00:16:05,391 --> 00:16:10,370
I still love to read it because it
expresses the outrage so perfectly.

222
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:15,610
And I'm going to attempt to do it in a
sort of Oxbridge accent accent because

223
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:19,610
the author who was originally a anonymous,

224
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:25,310
uh, in the book in which he said
this, he's listed, uh, in the,

225
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:30,260
uh, on the title page is simply a
graduate of Cambridge University.

226
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:37,930
So here is what you've said in the theory
with which we'd have to do absolute

227
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,720
ignorance,
AI

228
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:49,150
absolute ignorance is the art Visser
so that we may not see it as the

229
00:16:49,191 --> 00:16:51,230
fundamental principle of the whole system,

230
00:16:51,231 --> 00:16:54,890
that in order to make a
perfect and beautiful machine,

231
00:16:54,891 --> 00:16:59,490
it is not requisite to know how
to make it. The caps are in,

232
00:16:59,491 --> 00:17:00,324
the original

233
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:07,040
proposition will be filed on Koval
examination to express and condensed form,

234
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,160
you know,

235
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,160
central poor port of the theory and to
express in a few words all Mr Darwin's

236
00:17:13,591 --> 00:17:18,591
meaning who by a strange inversion of
reasoning seems like absolute ignorance,

237
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:26,660
fully qualified to take the place of
absolute wisdom in all the two points of

238
00:17:26,701 --> 00:17:29,550
creatives skill.
Exactly.

239
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,210
He's nailed it.
That's what Darwin did.

240
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:38,620
And it was a strange
inversion of reasoning.

241
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:44,170
Why do we send our children to university?

242
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:51,150
So did they get the wisdom so that they
can then do achievements of creative

243
00:17:51,151 --> 00:17:54,870
skill? Here's Darwin saying it's
the other way around. Now we can,

244
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,470
we can get brilliant design
out of absolute ignorance.

245
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,900
Well,
the idea was appealing to many people,

246
00:18:03,901 --> 00:18:08,040
but it really needed
another great Brit too.

247
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,810
Oh, show in detail how this might work.
And that's my second hero, Alan Turing.

248
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:20,180
And here's Turing strange and version
of reasoning. First of all, remember,

249
00:18:20,181 --> 00:18:23,900
here's Darwin's strange version in
order to make it perfect and beautiful

250
00:18:23,901 --> 00:18:26,060
machine that's not requisite
for know how to make it.

251
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:31,730
Here's touring's in order to be a
perfect and beautiful computing machine,

252
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,570
it is not requisite to
know what arithmetic is.

253
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:43,180
What Turing had figured out was
that the computers of his day,

254
00:18:43,191 --> 00:18:46,490
who were people,
many of them wearing dresses,

255
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,600
women who would read
mathematics in university,

256
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:56,460
that their jobs could be replaced by a
machine from which all the comprehension

257
00:18:58,371 --> 00:18:59,630
we're sort of laundered out.

258
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,820
And that was the dawn of the computer age.

259
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:10,160
So Darwin and touring together
have a common theme, which, uh,

260
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,480
is expressed in my, I suppose this
is my bumper sticker. Now these days,

261
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,730
competence without comprehension,

262
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:21,020
competence without comprehension.

263
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:27,120
The upshot of this is very
alarming to many people.

264
00:19:27,121 --> 00:19:30,890
That means that mind consciousness,
understanding, intentionality,

265
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,290
it's the effects,
not the cause.

266
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:40,510
The traditional view with God,

267
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:45,010
the intelligent designer providing all
the meaning and purpose and it sort of

268
00:19:45,011 --> 00:19:49,630
trickling down to the creations.
Throw that away.

269
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:54,160
It's not a mind first universe.
It's a matter first universe.

270
00:19:54,161 --> 00:19:58,870
Mine is a very recent
development on this planet.

271
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,630
Termites are not intelligent designers.

272
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,350
Beavers are not very
intelligent designers.

273
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:13,630
We are the first intelligent
designers and the tree of life.

274
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,900
And we come along very recently,

275
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,080
but what a difference we've made.

276
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:25,690
I want to talk about the
McCready explosion. I mentioned
the Cambrian explosion.

277
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:28,480
I want to talk about an even
more dramatic explosion,

278
00:20:28,481 --> 00:20:30,460
which I call the McCreaty explosion.

279
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,930
Paul MacCready,
how many of you know who he is?

280
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,100
He's a late great green engineer.

281
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,140
The gossamer Albatross,

282
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:45,340
the pedal power of the human powered plane
that flew across the English Channel.

283
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:49,550
That's one of Paul is brilliant creations,
uh,

284
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,870
of a real visionary man,
a wonderful stuff.

285
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:58,530
And he wrote a paper not so many years
ago where he calculated that 10,000 years

286
00:21:00,311 --> 00:21:01,144
ago,

287
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,310
a twinkling in evolutionary time,

288
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,400
the human population plus their livestock.

289
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:13,540
This is as agriculture was just
getting going 10,000 years ago.

290
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:18,930
If you took the human population at the
time plus all their livestock and pets,

291
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:25,260
it was probably in the order of a 10th
of a percent by weight of the terrestrial

292
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:28,120
vertebrate biomass of the animals.

293
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:31,960
We're leaving out all the insects in
the worms and the fish in the sea,

294
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:37,290
terrestrial vertebrate biomass a
fraction of 1% 10,000 years ago.

295
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:44,560
The percent today is rather hire.
Would anybody hazard a guess?

296
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:51,120
95% no, that's low. It's 98.

297
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,313
Yeah,

298
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,840
we have in golf the planet,
most of that is cattle.

299
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:05,100
But this is
probably the biggest,

300
00:22:05,101 --> 00:22:09,630
fastest
biological change on the planet ever.

301
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,440
And this happened in 10,000 years.

302
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:17,610
And genes don't explain it.

303
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,330
Technology explains it.

304
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:25,650
And Technology is not
transmitted through the genes

305
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:32,190
did, it was in fact the result of
another great technology transfer.

306
00:22:32,191 --> 00:22:37,191
I already described the eukaryotic
revolution where to to produce cells to

307
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:40,860
prokaryotic cells,

308
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:46,070
each with a billion year lineage of r
and d to give them the talents that they

309
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:49,920
had joined forces.

310
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:54,990
And suddenly you had this multitalented
new things that you carry odic cell

311
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,880
that was a fee can happy
event if ever there was one.

312
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,370
The next one

313
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:12,140
is the invasion of human brains
by symbiotic thinking tools means

314
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,960
a term of course is from
Richard Dawkins the selfish,

315
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:22,680
I don't know if you've read the
selfish gene, how have you haven't,

316
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,900
we'll put it on your list.
It is.

317
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:28,470
It is one of the great science
books of the 20th century.

318
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,140
And uh,
uh,

319
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:36,170
it is often denigrated and dissed
by people who's scared of it.

320
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,200
It is still to this day was published
in [inaudible] 76 probably the single

321
00:23:42,601 --> 00:23:43,080
best,

322
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:48,080
clearest and most exciting a survey of
what we know about evolution but it's

323
00:23:48,591 --> 00:23:53,300
been written.
And in that book,

324
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:55,520
the selfish gene,

325
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:01,730
he also wrote about a new kind of
replicator, which you call it a meme,

326
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:05,330
a selfish meme,
which are like jeans are like viruses,

327
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:10,400
they are cultural
replicators and like viruses.

328
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:15,410
A virus travels like it doesn't carry
its own replication machinery with it.

329
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:20,740
It has to invade a cell and commandeer
the copy machine in that cell to make

330
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:24,800
copies of it rather than the, the, the uh,

331
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,990
DNA that the cell was supposed to copy.

332
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:33,820
And he suggested that culture was
composed of entities that were similarly

333
00:24:33,981 --> 00:24:38,981
capable of provoking their own
replication by invading brains

334
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:45,950
we don't inherit means via our genes.

335
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:51,410
We learn them from our parents,
from our peers, from our friends,

336
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,090
from television.

337
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,530
We are constantly bombarded with ideas.

338
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,760
Some of them stick, some of them
go in one ear out. The other,

339
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:07,390
the ones that stick take up residence in
our brain and then they have to compete

340
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:13,670
for life support with all the others
that are trying to get in there.

341
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:20,120
And every time you think it,
you make an offspring.

342
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:26,660
Every time you say a word, you make
another copy. Every time you think a word,

343
00:25:26,661 --> 00:25:27,740
you make another copy

344
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,870
and words of the best examples of mutes.
I'll get to that.

345
00:25:32,871 --> 00:25:34,730
I'm getting a little bit of edit myself.

346
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:39,380
The main point though for our purposes
here is that we don't have to design them

347
00:25:39,381 --> 00:25:40,214
ourselves.

348
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:46,750
We are the beneficiaries of thousands
of years of cultural evolution.

349
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,253
We don't,

350
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:53,500
we don't have to design alphabetizing
lists are long division or,

351
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,020
or,
uh,

352
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:59,900
plain geometry or calculus or,
uh,

353
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:05,060
uh, how to write music or the, uh, uh,

354
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:09,770
well tempered scale or a

355
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:14,990
perspective or I could go on forever.
Of course,

356
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,580
these are all highly
developed ways of doing things

357
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:22,063
that

358
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:23,520
or not instincts,

359
00:26:23,521 --> 00:26:26,370
instincts are ways of doing things
that are passed through the germline,

360
00:26:26,371 --> 00:26:28,110
through the,
through the DNA.

361
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:34,350
Memes are just like instincts,
their ways of doing things,

362
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:37,560
but they're not passed through
the germline. They are,

363
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:42,360
they are picked up perceptually,
uh,

364
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,790
socially.
Many in most cases,

365
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,260
we don't have to design them ourselves.
In fact, nobody has to design them.

366
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,453
Okay.

367
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:57,820
So the McCready explosion isn't an
explosive amplification of competence,

368
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:03,670
which eventually it started off being
competence without comprehension.

369
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:08,380
I think it's very important to
realize that our early ancestors,

370
00:27:08,381 --> 00:27:13,381
the first at the first hominids infected
with memes were still pretty clueless.

371
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,970
They didn't know what they were doing.
They didn't think of it as cultural.

372
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:19,360
They didn't think of it as anything.

373
00:27:19,361 --> 00:27:22,300
They just had all these new
habits that were infectious,

374
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:24,940
that got them doing things
that they hadn't done before.

375
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,060
And it turned out that these built
and built and built and built,

376
00:27:28,061 --> 00:27:32,560
and pretty soon they had language and
then they had epic poetry and then they

377
00:27:32,561 --> 00:27:37,240
had, uh, architecture and boat
building off to the races.

378
00:27:37,241 --> 00:27:38,074
We go

379
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:42,370
and be evolved into
competence with comprehension.

380
00:27:42,371 --> 00:27:44,700
So finally we get to
comprehension the dark.

381
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:49,890
So it's the Darwinian strange
inversion reinvented. We get a move,

382
00:27:49,891 --> 00:27:54,891
a trend away from bottom up competence
without comprehension to the evolution of

383
00:27:58,741 --> 00:28:01,290
a different kind of

384
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:06,150
designing,
which is competence with comprehension.

385
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:11,100
To understand this, we have to
understand free floating rationales.

386
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,020
Trees do things.
I know some people don't like that term.

387
00:28:16,021 --> 00:28:19,850
I'm sort of sorry I coined it when I did,
but it's sticking and,

388
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:23,430
and I can't go back and change it now
and in a way it's sort of evocative

389
00:28:23,431 --> 00:28:27,810
because what I mean by a free
floating rationale is a reason,

390
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,600
a real objective reason why
something is the way it is.

391
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:35,780
That was never anybody's reason until
some clever person analyze the thing and

392
00:28:36,991 --> 00:28:41,070
figure it out retrospectively
what it was good for trees to do,

393
00:28:41,071 --> 00:28:43,800
things for reasons that
trees don't know them,

394
00:28:43,801 --> 00:28:47,520
that they aren't reasons that
the trees have and consider,

395
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:51,930
but they do lots of things for
reasons fun. G Do things for reason.

396
00:28:51,931 --> 00:28:53,670
Bacteria do things for reasons.

397
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:59,010
The biotic world is saturated with
reasons from the molecular scale on it.

398
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:04,490
There are reasons why the parts inside
the bacterium have the shapes they do and

399
00:29:07,201 --> 00:29:10,260
have the powers they do and
fit together the way they do.

400
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,420
And we can reverse engineer these.

401
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:17,010
Don't think that those reasons were the
reasons represented in the head of any

402
00:29:17,011 --> 00:29:18,510
intelligent designer ever.

403
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:25,040
They just were uncovered and
exploited by natural selection.

404
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:30,530
And now we clever reasoners that we
are can sometimes go back and reverse

405
00:29:30,721 --> 00:29:35,310
engineer them and uncover the reasons
that then become represented for the very

406
00:29:35,311 --> 00:29:37,890
first time. When we write
about it, talk about it,

407
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,950
argue about whether this is the
reason for that is a reason,

408
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:45,670
something is the way it is. And we
do things for a reason. We shiver,

409
00:29:45,671 --> 00:29:50,320
we vomit, we blink and we don't
have to know why we do it,

410
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,080
but there are reasons and
there are good reasons.

411
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:58,000
And then there's the things that we do
where we choose and decide and we act for

412
00:29:58,001 --> 00:29:58,834
reasons.

413
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:03,430
Sometimes we do that without even
appreciating that we're doing that

414
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,110
retrospectively, we may figure out,
oh, it was a good reason for that.

415
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:13,520
And of course sometimes we
confabulating sometimes on purpose.

416
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:17,540
How many of you have ever
made a move in a chess game,

417
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:20,750
which only later you realized
it was a brilliant move.

418
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:26,990
And did you admit it?
I,

419
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:29,990
there was a very good reason for them.
I didn't think about it at the time,

420
00:30:29,991 --> 00:30:31,940
but it slowly dawned on me

421
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,770
that phenomenon I am arguing is much,

422
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:41,800
much more frequent than we
think because we tend to uh,

423
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:48,190
advertise all of our successes
with retrospective accounts
of the reasoning that

424
00:30:51,021 --> 00:30:54,980
led up to them.
And it may be in some sense be accurate.

425
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,820
We're actually reverse
engineering how we got there.

426
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:00,860
But that doesn't mean we
thought of it at the time.

427
00:31:00,861 --> 00:31:05,861
It doesn't mean we had the reasons in
mind cause you don't need a mind to act

428
00:31:07,371 --> 00:31:09,110
for reasons.
That's one of the lessons.

429
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:14,450
So the problem that culture
solves is it is the question,

430
00:31:14,451 --> 00:31:17,990
how do you get a buck tight mine
out of a termite colony brain?

431
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:24,310
How do we get intelligent design with
representation of reasons out of 86

432
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:25,460
billion mindless neurons?

433
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:27,390
Yeah.

434
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:30,690
And that was the second great
endosymbiotic revolution,

435
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,353
Huh?

436
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:34,910
We are apes with infected brains.

437
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:41,840
Our brains have been colonized by
all of these viral like things.

438
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:46,260
A virus has an alive,
but it evolves.

439
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,800
Some people think viruses are alive.
You can argue about that,

440
00:31:52,801 --> 00:31:55,530
but viroids at least.
All right, what are they?

441
00:31:56,910 --> 00:32:00,510
A virus is a string of nuclear
cas who'd with attitude.

442
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:07,450
It just happens to have a shape that
gives it the competence to provoke its own

443
00:32:07,621 --> 00:32:11,400
replication. Uh, under many circumstances.

444
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:16,380
Meme similarly are things made
out of information with attitude.

445
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,320
They provoke their own replication

446
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:22,790
and they don't have to understand this.

447
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:26,150
This is just the secret of their success.

448
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:32,890
We're now ready to look
at cultural evolution and,

449
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:37,610
uh, nobody in this room I think will be
intimidated by such a simple diagram,

450
00:32:37,611 --> 00:32:41,060
but I find that for many audiences
have to sort of lead them through this.

451
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:46,190
This is one of Peter Godfrey
Smith's Darwinian spaces. Uh, uh,

452
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:50,660
we can't easily imagine four
dimensions or more. So w we,

453
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:54,110
well if we want to imagine
changes in evolution,

454
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:59,990
not only in things evolving but in
the very process of evolution itself,

455
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:05,770
we can take various features
of the evolutionary phenomena
and map them on three

456
00:33:10,491 --> 00:33:14,960
dimensions in a, in a three
space and then put things on the,

457
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,150
on the,
on the Cuban various places.

458
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:21,770
So in this case we're going to
put a down at zero zero zero.

459
00:33:21,771 --> 00:33:24,170
We're going to put very
Darwinian evolution.

460
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:27,920
That is to say this is um,
uh,

461
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:33,230
no competent, no comprehension
at all. Mindless trial and error,

462
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:38,090
a random search, uh, bottom up.

463
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:42,500
So if you like it sort of
Termite Castle type R and d.

464
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:48,050
Okay. Up in the upper right hand
corner, your far right hand corner.

465
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,000
I put intelligent design,

466
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:56,290
which is high and comprehension involves
top down methods and involve directed

467
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:04,970
search,
purposefully directed search.

468
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:10,420
So now the question is how do we get
from the lower left hand corner to the

469
00:34:11,211 --> 00:34:14,810
upper right hand corner in
a hundred thousand years?

470
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:22,590
And what I want to argue is that evolution
itself evolved as cultural evolution

471
00:34:24,821 --> 00:34:29,821
got under way the products of cultural
evolution change the very terms of of

472
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:37,190
selection so that the process of evolution
was sped up and sped up and made more

473
00:34:38,561 --> 00:34:39,394
efficient.

474
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:45,360
The searches became less
blind and trial and error.

475
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:50,440
The organization of the
searches became more top down,

476
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:56,130
who comprehension level gradually goes
up and we ended up not at the pinnacle

477
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,680
but close to it.

478
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:03,953
Okay.

479
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,340
I put Picasso,

480
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:11,680
I put the termite castle down in the
lower left and I'm putting Picasso up in

481
00:35:11,681 --> 00:35:13,000
the upper right hand corner.

482
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:18,490
Not because he was the most
intelligent designer ever

483
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:25,180
will because he said he was.
He once said,

484
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:27,400
[inaudible] the truth,

485
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:33,180
I don't search,
I find

486
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,870
I just get it without any
grubby trial and error.

487
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:42,480
No way ratios,
no false starts.

488
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:47,370
I just leap with my God like genius to
the Mount Everest peak in the fitness

489
00:35:47,371 --> 00:35:50,550
landscape and Bingo,
I created another masterpiece.

490
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:56,870
Well,
[inaudible] partial truth.

491
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,880
My answer is married,

492
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:03,913
not true.

493
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,380
It's an ideal of creative intelligence
that even Picasso could not meet.

494
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,910
And in fact, if you look at his work, you
see that he made, sometimes it doesn't,

495
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:17,560
sometimes even hundreds of variations
on a drawing or a painting. Uh, uh,

496
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:19,540
before he stopped working on that,

497
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:23,680
his part of his genius layer and the
fact that unlike a lot of other artists,

498
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:25,600
he signed those and sold them.

499
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:33,220
Imagine if you could
do that with software.

500
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,833
Okay.

501
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:39,900
So I'm going to replace
Picasso with Barak,

502
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:44,790
who really is an exemplary in was
an exemplary intelligent designer.

503
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:47,100
Deep comprehension of what he was doing.

504
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:50,160
It was highly constrained
trial and error methods.

505
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:52,860
He was a very fast composer,

506
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:58,530
cantata a week for years.
Amazing.

507
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:03,660
And it was constrained by knowledge,
by comprehension, by foresight.

508
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,830
He really knew what he was doing
and he had purpose and foresight.

509
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:11,220
He was magnificently
equipped with thinking tools.

510
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,340
He couldn't have existed before the,

511
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:19,350
the system for writing music out
and instruments like the Oregon.

512
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:23,250
And in fact,
he wasn't just an organist.

513
00:37:23,251 --> 00:37:26,700
He was more famous in his day as
an organist and as a composer.

514
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,980
He was in Oregon repair man.

515
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:34,920
He understood Oregon's from
an engineering perspective.

516
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:40,240
So he really does make an
exemplary intelligent designer.

517
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,610
He had music theory,
he had the history of music,

518
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:50,080
vast knowledge, this, these
are the thinking tools he used.

519
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:55,720
Now we're ready to look at a comparison.

520
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:58,443
Okay,

521
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:03,750
I thank Matt Ridley for this slide.
Wonderful writer about evolution.

522
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:06,480
On the left you see an
national and hand axe.

523
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:12,300
They were made by our ancestors for
about a million years without any change.

524
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:15,930
It's one of the strangest artifacts ever.

525
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,810
A million years without any change

526
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:23,280
on the right you'd see a mouse,

527
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:27,550
nobody invented the Ashmolean hand axe.

528
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,860
Douglas Engelbart invented the mouse.

529
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,490
The was invented

530
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:41,550
when back in the 70s maybe
late sixties so almost extinct.

531
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,850
It may soon be extinct.

532
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:52,900
That's the difference in speed of cultural
evolution measured on the big scale

533
00:38:53,841 --> 00:38:54,800
of the tree of life.

534
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,870
So here's our diagram again.

535
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:03,070
First thing I want to acknowledge us
that we're not the only species that has

536
00:39:03,071 --> 00:39:04,990
some cultural evolution.

537
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:10,300
Chimpanzees have a several traditions of,

538
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:15,480
of not cracking and have a termite
fishing or aunt fishing that are passed on

539
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:19,870
non genetically. And there's
different traditions in different,

540
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:25,270
in different troops. And that's where
it stops. It never goes cumulative.

541
00:39:25,271 --> 00:39:29,870
It never goes recursive had never piles up
there.

542
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:33,670
They're not a one trick pony,
but there are about a three trick pony.

543
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:41,240
But now I want to talk about our cultural
evolution and all the things that are

544
00:39:41,241 --> 00:39:44,720
made of information. These are some of
the most important things in our lives.

545
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:46,160
You are very familiar.

546
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:49,130
You are living in this world
of things made of information.

547
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:54,500
They have to have a physical embodiment.
This is dualism.

548
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:58,990
But what matters
in every case,

549
00:39:58,991 --> 00:40:03,010
there's something that you can send from
a to B in a bit string if you want to.

550
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,310
You can't send a bowl of soup

551
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:08,623
that way.

552
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:13,700
So now let's look at the key

553
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:19,880
elements of cultural influence, uh,
cultural evolution in our species.

554
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:22,310
And I think words are the key elements.

555
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:27,260
And I want to suggest that the first
words that existed were what we might call

556
00:40:27,261 --> 00:40:30,140
sin anthropic words.
Now ascending,

557
00:40:30,141 --> 00:40:34,460
sending thropic species is a
species which is not domesticated,

558
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:39,530
but has evolved by natural selection
to thrive and human company.

559
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,090
Mice, rats, squirrels,

560
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,660
barn swallows,
bedbugs,

561
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,630
cockroaches, and many, many more.

562
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:57,970
Those are sending thropic species.

563
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:05,230
The first words were like that.
Nobody owned them. Nobody.

564
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,140
People didn't even hardly notice
that they were using them. They use,

565
00:41:09,141 --> 00:41:10,840
we're just habits that they developed.

566
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,850
I go into this from a lot
more detail in the book.

567
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:20,330
Next we get domesticated words and as
Darwin tells us that the key feature of

568
00:41:20,921 --> 00:41:23,010
domestication is you
control the reproduction of

569
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:26,360
yeah, animal. So

570
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:31,970
do you have a vocabulary? Those are
your words. You have your vocabulary,

571
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:35,180
50 60 70 80,000 words,

572
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:40,630
and if you ever catch yourself about to
say one word and then replacing it with

573
00:41:41,661 --> 00:41:44,540
another word, reframing what
you say before you blurt it out.

574
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:49,550
Most are domesticated words.
You're controlling their replication,

575
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:51,410
not perfectly,

576
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:56,590
but you're playing a strong role
in which words get replicated when,

577
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:02,600
and a lot of this is beneath notice,
but nevertheless,

578
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:06,020
this leads to differential replication.

579
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,910
And the words are not all was wonderful.

580
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:16,020
I like to tell my students that there are,
um,

581
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:19,470
it's quite possible for there to be a,

582
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:24,260
a word or an expression
which is of no utility,

583
00:42:24,261 --> 00:42:25,094
whatever,

584
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,480
but which catches on and which has
because it has its own fitness.

585
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:33,380
It doesn't have to boost your fitness.
It just has to be able to survive.

586
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:38,990
And one day a student said,
uh, can you give me an example?

587
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:44,240
I said, well, it's like if you are,

588
00:42:44,241 --> 00:42:48,050
I'm like talking about some subject like,
and uh,

589
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:53,080
like it occurs to you that like maybe
there would be a word in the sentence that

590
00:42:54,621 --> 00:42:58,990
like he didn't have to use all.
And he said,

591
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:01,420
I get the point.
I want an example.

592
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:12,500
It's very important that memes
can evolve without human notice.

593
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:18,840
Even though they involve the
utilization of human perception,

594
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:23,520
the pronunciation of a trim
or the meaning of a term,

595
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:28,530
who gradually shift over your lifetime
or over a couple of generations or over a

596
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:33,090
few years. And suddenly
you may notice, oh my gosh,

597
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:36,630
this used to mean something else.
Now it means something different.

598
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:38,130
Happens all the time.

599
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:43,530
That's mimetic evolution after
domesticated words. We get coined words.

600
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:46,080
The word meme is a good example,

601
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:50,220
deliberately coined sort of like GM food,

602
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,480
intelligently designed terms,
you can design them all day,

603
00:43:54,481 --> 00:43:59,220
but whether they catch on depends
whether they replicate is that's the hard

604
00:43:59,221 --> 00:44:04,020
part. So even though they are given
a boost by human intelligence,

605
00:44:04,021 --> 00:44:07,830
they still have to survive by
differential replication in the society.

606
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:12,450
Most coined words don't.
Then we get to technical terms,

607
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:17,550
which are
very deliberately created,

608
00:44:17,551 --> 00:44:18,690
designed and,

609
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:23,990
and their reproduction is fostered by
careful training and and examination and

610
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:33,300
sort of group pressure. You to get
everybody on the same page here.

611
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,780
Now phenotype genotype,

612
00:44:36,781 --> 00:44:39,840
if you don't understand
that you fail a class.

613
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:41,903
So we,

614
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,710
those are sort of hyper
domesticated words where we're very,

615
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:51,570
we expand a lot of energy and time to
make sure they replicate and that they

616
00:44:51,571 --> 00:44:56,130
record replicate accurately.
And then we get to internet means,

617
00:44:57,390 --> 00:45:00,900
and a lot of people would say the
Internet means or sort of a reductio ad

618
00:45:00,901 --> 00:45:03,030
absurdum of Dawkins' concept of memes.

619
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:08,280
And I used to think that myself about,
I think that's too bad.

620
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:12,660
This wonderful term is being
hijacked and used in this dumb way.

621
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:13,980
And then I realized,

622
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:19,920
and the reason I thought it was too bad
because an intelligently designed meme

623
00:45:19,921 --> 00:45:21,450
is a contradiction in terms.

624
00:45:21,451 --> 00:45:25,830
You might think it's supposed to
be an evolutionarily designed,

625
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:30,270
bottom up designed cultural item.
But my gosh,

626
00:45:30,271 --> 00:45:35,220
they have contests to see who can
design the most viral Internet meme.

627
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:39,840
That's manifestly, these are, this
is an attempted intelligent design.

628
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:44,940
But is this a reductio ad? Absurdum
no. Is this a contradiction in terms?

629
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:46,111
Well, in a way, yes.

630
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:51,111
But so what a splittable ass who Adam
is also a contradiction in terms,

631
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:57,470
but nobody goes around saying
there's no such thing as an atom.

632
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,840
So what we have to recognize,

633
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:08,370
and one of the main points of my book
is to show that darkens concept of memes

634
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:12,750
does just fine as long as we allow for
the fact that the evolutionary process

635
00:46:12,751 --> 00:46:15,690
that enables cultural evolution changes,

636
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:20,010
that evolution itself
evolves into a process,

637
00:46:20,011 --> 00:46:24,720
which is evermore like what tradition
tells us cultural evolution is namely

638
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:28,770
intelligently designed
treasures that are understood,

639
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:32,850
bequeath to the young,
uh, et Cetera, et cetera.

640
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:38,100
So that traditional views of culture
are sort of limiting cases of cultural

641
00:46:38,101 --> 00:46:38,934
evolution.

642
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:44,310
And in between we have every combination
and degree of 70 insightful tinkering.

643
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:49,410
One of my favorite examples is the
Polynesian canoe. I'm not going.

644
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:54,390
Uh, and this is where I got the
quote that I'm going to read,

645
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:59,070
but it turns out that the philosopher
who who was writing it was not writing

646
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:02,130
about Polynesian canoes,
but about French fishing boats.

647
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:05,340
Every boat is copied from another boat.

648
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:07,770
Let's reason was follows
in the manner of Darwin,

649
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:12,600
it's clear that a very badly made boat
will end up on the bottom after one or

650
00:47:12,601 --> 00:47:14,580
two voyages and us never be copied.

651
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:20,960
One could say then with complete rigor
that it is to see herself who fashions

652
00:47:21,181 --> 00:47:25,260
the boats, choosing those which
function and destroying the others.

653
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:30,070
That's natural selection.
If comes back, copy it.

654
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:35,590
If it floats, copy it and notice it. This,

655
00:47:35,591 --> 00:47:37,510
that's the tradition that
you're working under.

656
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:39,790
You don't have to know
why it's a good boat.

657
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:44,290
You might be all wrong about why it's a
good boat if you're just conservative.

658
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:47,860
I don't know why they do it this way,
but grandpa did it this way.

659
00:47:47,861 --> 00:47:52,570
I'm going to do it this way. And by and
large, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

660
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:56,360
And gradually the design
will stabilize and uneven,

661
00:47:56,380 --> 00:48:00,700
improve all without any
comprehension required. In fact,

662
00:48:00,701 --> 00:48:04,570
comprehension can stand in the way.
You can have a brilliant idea,

663
00:48:04,571 --> 00:48:08,590
which turns out to be just wrong.
Mother Nature punishes you for that.

664
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:14,150
So in this diagram,
the traditional model of culture as well,

665
00:48:14,151 --> 00:48:17,260
and the upper upper reaches
up near the ceiling.

666
00:48:17,261 --> 00:48:21,700
It's the economic model of culture
where we think of culture as treasures,

667
00:48:21,701 --> 00:48:24,970
you know, high culture, opera, museums,

668
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:27,490
technology science,

669
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:30,880
the declaration of independence,

670
00:48:30,881 --> 00:48:34,180
all that wonderful stuff
which we appreciate,

671
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:36,820
preserve honor,

672
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:42,820
make sure that our children
and grandchildren, uh,

673
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,450
take control of them and
appreciate the value of,

674
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:49,570
of keeping them alive and sober.
The preservation of our culture.

675
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:52,420
And that's a very real phenomenon.

676
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:56,590
But what we have to realize is
that that's the icing on the cake.

677
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,480
In addition to all the treasures of
culture. There's all the trash of culture,

678
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:03,490
all the junk,
all the graffiti,

679
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:08,170
all this stuff that's just fad and
fancy aid comes along for the ride.

680
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:09,640
Okay?

681
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:12,890
Because it can,
that's it.

682
00:49:12,891 --> 00:49:16,310
It has its own fitness independently
of what we think of it.

683
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:20,180
Some of it we'd love to eradicate
and if only we could, but we can't.

684
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:24,230
So now we're living in the
age of intelligent design

685
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:29,000
and cultural evolution is to
become every more top down,

686
00:49:29,001 --> 00:49:31,280
evermore comprehending
and self comprehending,

687
00:49:31,281 --> 00:49:33,380
evermore refined in its search methods.

688
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:37,790
And of course the same thing has been
true genetic evolution because we now have

689
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:41,000
GM food and we have Craig vendor,
et Cetera, et Cetera, et cetera.

690
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:43,940
So we seem to be entering a new,

691
00:49:43,941 --> 00:49:47,090
wonderful world with
Google leading the way.

692
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,610
But I want to suggest that what we're
doing is we're entering the age of post

693
00:49:52,611 --> 00:49:53,810
intelligent design.

694
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:55,880
Okay?

695
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,070
Why?
Because in many fields,

696
00:49:58,071 --> 00:50:01,580
intelligent designers are
exploiting the truth of Oracle.

697
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:04,400
Second rule that evolution
is cleverer than you are.

698
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:09,940
Genetic Algorithms, deep learning,
evolutionary architecture,

699
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,460
nanotechnology,
uh,

700
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:17,980
breeding nanotechnology by
making a novel proteins in a,

701
00:50:19,821 --> 00:50:23,420
in a evolutionary setting,
machine learning.

702
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:25,560
Okay.

703
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,090
These are technologies which

704
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:33,300
wonderful epistomological
competences without comprehension.

705
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,273
Okay.

706
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:39,840
Watson Beats Ken Jennings in jeopardy.

707
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:41,760
Google translate,

708
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:47,630
lovely example of competence
without comprehension and many,

709
00:50:48,031 --> 00:50:50,730
many others. And in
fact, in science itself,

710
00:50:50,731 --> 00:50:55,731
we're now getting black box science
where you got a box designed by some

711
00:50:56,131 --> 00:51:01,050
wonderful technocrats. You'd put
the data in, you push the button,

712
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:06,030
you get an answer,
which you can prove is highly reliable,

713
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:09,300
better than you could do using
the old fashioned methods.

714
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:13,260
Do you understand how it does
it? No. Do you have to know?

715
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:19,590
So we're moving away from
the ideal of comprehension

716
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:21,873
that

717
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:25,220
created intelligent
design in the first place.

718
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:30,260
One little bit. And then
I'll close on this. Uh,

719
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:36,640
Noam Chomsky is famous for distinguishing
between what do he cause problems

720
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,490
versus mysteries.
I'm 90 call some puzzles,

721
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:45,760
problems we can solve like evolution and
quantum mechanics and plate tectonics

722
00:51:49,191 --> 00:51:53,150
and meteorology and the big bang.

723
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,780
And then there's mysteries which are
beyond human. Ken Now and forever.

724
00:51:58,960 --> 00:51:59,793
I find that,
uh,

725
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:04,240
I really dislike that idea
because it's so defeatist.

726
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:06,970
Basically says, give up. Don't even try.

727
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:10,000
But he's inspired some people,

728
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:15,001
some philosophers in particular to become
what has become known as Mysterians

729
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:17,670
who make a point.
I,

730
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:21,490
I think they should wear bags over
their head for saying things like this.

731
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:27,430
Make a point of declaring.
We will never understand it.

732
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:29,290
Well,
speak for yourself.

733
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:32,770
The rest of us are going to go
on and try it if you don't mind.

734
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:39,190
So I used to have a very, very dim view
of this whole approach and I still do,

735
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:43,390
but Tom's, he's recently changed his tune.
I want to draw your attention to this.

736
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:48,670
In 2014 he said the following things, you
know, I think this was on the podcast,

737
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:53,560
while there's a conceptual distinction
between problems and Mr EDC says,

738
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:56,350
we accept the best explanation
as science can give us,

739
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:58,390
even when we can't imagine how they work.

740
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:01,900
It doesn't matter what
we can conceive anymore.

741
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:03,940
We've given up on that.

742
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,780
Well,
there's comprehension matter.

743
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:13,160
Do we want post comprehension science?

744
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:15,520
Okay,

745
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,850
do we want to technological
competence without comprehension.

746
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:26,460
Darpa has gotten into the act with a
new initiative for so explainable AI,

747
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,850
which seems to be directed
precisely this issue.

748
00:53:29,851 --> 00:53:34,530
It's going to make ais that can
explain their results to us.

749
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:39,090
Poor adults who are using the systems.
Is that a good idea?

750
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,370
I think it depends on how it's done.

751
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:47,160
Should we try to make persons out
of these explaining ais? I think no.

752
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:50,370
On the pro pro side it seems,
well that's great.

753
00:53:50,371 --> 00:53:55,371
They can explain their reasoning to
us so then they can develop their own

754
00:53:55,591 --> 00:54:00,300
imaginative curiosity and epistemic goals.
We sure we want to do that.

755
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:07,620
I think we shouldn't because it's going
to blur the lines of moral responsibility

756
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:14,460
because they don't have skin in the
game and we want the people who make the

757
00:54:14,461 --> 00:54:19,230
decisions that really matter to
take moral responsibility for them.

758
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:22,950
And we can do this with
some legal innovations.

759
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:27,540
We could license users of these new,

760
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:32,640
the epistemological black boxes and
they would have to prove that they

761
00:54:32,641 --> 00:54:37,641
understood the limitations and the
boundaries of any system that they used.

762
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:41,490
And as it were made money using,

763
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:47,150
they would be morally responsible for
any misuse of anything that came out of

764
00:54:48,301 --> 00:54:49,350
the box that they use.

765
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:54,450
And they would not be able to declare
whether who didn't understand,

766
00:54:54,451 --> 00:54:57,570
because you'd have a strict liability
law was it doesn't matter whether you

767
00:54:57,571 --> 00:55:01,770
understand you want to use this
tool you have to take as it were,

768
00:55:01,771 --> 00:55:05,640
the risk of being held liable
for something if it goes wrong.

769
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:11,620
That's a bracing test,
but it's a good one.

770
00:55:11,650 --> 00:55:15,820
It keeps people very honest, keeps,

771
00:55:15,821 --> 00:55:20,821
gives them a real sense of due diligence
and keeps them from just taking the

772
00:55:22,091 --> 00:55:25,750
manufacturer's word for it and
running off into the sunset.

773
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:31,870
Makers should have the responsibility and
we have the incentive to advertise all

774
00:55:31,871 --> 00:55:34,210
the flaws,
gaps and weaknesses of their systems.

775
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:38,770
Advertising even you might even have,
I think it would be a good thing,

776
00:55:38,890 --> 00:55:41,170
have sort of tutorial
programs built into them.

777
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:44,950
You can't use this system
until you can spot the flaws.

778
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:51,310
Now this is going to take you 10 or 20
hours depending on how clever you are to

779
00:55:51,311 --> 00:55:56,311
really get to understand what's real
and what's facade in this system.

780
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:02,170
I think that would be a very good idea.
Many years ago we at Tufts,

781
00:56:02,171 --> 00:56:05,350
my colleague Jordan Smith and
I created the software studio,

782
00:56:05,351 --> 00:56:07,000
the curricular software studio,

783
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:10,880
and the idea was to use computers to,

784
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:13,840
to enhance human imagination.

785
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:19,170
We called them imagination prostheses
and what one of our metaphors was,

786
00:56:19,391 --> 00:56:20,980
there's two kinds of empowerment.

787
00:56:21,970 --> 00:56:25,090
There's the bulldozer and
the Nautilus machine way,

788
00:56:25,870 --> 00:56:27,820
the bulldozer where you
can move a mountain,

789
00:56:27,821 --> 00:56:29,650
but you're still a 98 pound weakling.

790
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:35,680
The Nautilus machine is a technology that
which actually enhances your strength,

791
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:39,280
your personal strength. And we want
to do the same thing for imagination.

792
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:41,860
We want to make imagination enhancers,

793
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:47,100
systems that help people become better
thinkers independently of the system

794
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:49,743
they're using.

795
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:55,440
I think we want to make AI's that
are nautilus machines for the mind,

796
00:56:55,471 --> 00:57:00,190
not bulldozers, tools, not colleagues.

797
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:02,230
Thank you for your attention.

798
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:08,070
[inaudible] there's microphones.

799
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:13,750
Anybody that has up questions
should step up to the microphone.

800
00:57:16,010 --> 00:57:17,680
All right, your friends
for coming. Thank you.

801
00:57:17,690 --> 00:57:21,590
I'm very interested to read your book and
I was just going through the index and

802
00:57:21,591 --> 00:57:24,090
I see you mentioned,
um,

803
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:29,200
Kaufman and Deacon Terrence Deacon
Deacon a few times and I was wondering,

804
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:34,110
trying to get the scaffolding right in
my mind when you refer to Deakin and, uh,

805
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:35,413
the book,

806
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:38,930
can you kind of put that in perspective
against what you're saying that there's

807
00:57:39,110 --> 00:57:44,110
purposelessness in the lower forms of
life because it Kinda more my reading of

808
00:57:44,931 --> 00:57:46,610
him would be the,

809
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:51,620
I can incomplete nature like heirs to
Tilian final cause starts to emerge

810
00:57:51,951 --> 00:57:55,190
spontaneously.
It rather lower levels of order.

811
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:58,640
Well, in fact, I think
Terry and I agree, uh,

812
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:01,970
although we'll put it in slightly
different ways. Um, Louisa,

813
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:06,530
I did a long and really favorable
review of, of, of deacons book.

814
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:11,330
It's on my website. Um, and uh,

815
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:18,800
deacon changed my mind about something
that I think is really important and

816
00:58:18,801 --> 00:58:20,240
that's what I discuss in this book.

817
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:22,610
Okay.

818
00:58:22,610 --> 00:58:27,230
He argues that
brilliant though

819
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:33,890
touring and Newell Newell,
Simon Mccarthy,

820
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:39,320
Minsky and, uh, Shannon, let's say,

821
00:58:39,321 --> 00:58:42,680
are the brilliant as the
simplifications that they

822
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:46,610
created,
which made the computer age possible.

823
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:51,500
There's an important regard in which
they've let us into the wrong set of

824
00:58:51,501 --> 00:58:52,334
architectures

825
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:57,550
because all the architectures
that are made possible

826
00:58:59,050 --> 00:59:00,490
by their simplifications

827
00:59:02,050 --> 00:59:04,900
involve a separation of
energy and information.

828
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:11,840
You don't have to worry. A computer
doesn't have to worry about words,

829
00:59:11,930 --> 00:59:13,580
where it's going to get, it's, it's,

830
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:18,640
it's voltage from it's computers,

831
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,070
parasitic

832
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:26,480
on us. And he says, life isn't like that.

833
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:30,800
The thing that is most
important about say,

834
00:59:30,801 --> 00:59:35,801
a brain who is that those individual
neurons are semi autonomous.

835
00:59:36,970 --> 00:59:39,850
And you have to remember they are,
the way I put it in the book,

836
00:59:39,851 --> 00:59:44,851
there are the direct descendants of free
floating you carry out that fended for

837
00:59:45,771 --> 00:59:50,771
themselves in a difficult
ocean environment for
millions of years before they

838
00:59:51,771 --> 00:59:54,500
ever became parts of
multicellular organisms.

839
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,980
What are they doing in there?

840
00:59:59,510 --> 01:00:03,950
They're trying to stay alive.
This is deacons point.

841
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:09,220
You make me an architecture of basic
parts which are trying to stay alive.

842
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:17,420
What you're looking for work that's
going to be a really different computer

843
01:00:17,421 --> 01:00:21,650
architecture room. Anything that we
see coming out of the sort of fun,

844
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:22,520
Wyman tradition,

845
01:00:23,090 --> 01:00:26,900
even programs which
have some of the flavor.

846
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:30,310
Um,
well

847
01:00:30,990 --> 01:00:33,340
production systems and,
and uh,

848
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:38,780
many architectures of good old fashioned
AI had this nice sort of competitive

849
01:00:39,390 --> 01:00:43,080
feelings, but they, they're not, it's
not fundamental enough. So I think,

850
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:47,690
I think Deakin's book hard as it is a
very good read for the reasons that I

851
01:00:47,730 --> 01:00:51,930
described in the book. Uh, but
I don't think that he says,

852
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:57,110
and if he does, this will be a
point of disagreement with him that

853
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:06,000
teleology in any sort of very
strong sense comes in. Well,

854
01:01:06,001 --> 01:01:08,910
I agree that it comes in with the,
with the, with the origin of life.

855
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:12,210
I've got a whole section of
what happened before bacteria.

856
01:01:12,690 --> 01:01:15,240
That's to me one of my
favorite sections in the book,

857
01:01:15,241 --> 01:01:17,130
talking about how life
could ever get started.

858
01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:23,450
And what I argued there is the
teleology comes in gradually as we move,

859
01:01:24,990 --> 01:01:28,020
as I put it from how come to what?

860
01:01:28,021 --> 01:01:30,330
For two different why questions

861
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:37,880
I to teach my students this.
I have a pair of examples.

862
01:01:40,450 --> 01:01:41,283
MMM.

863
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:43,170
Why are planets spiritual?

864
01:01:45,690 --> 01:01:47,550
Why are ball bearings spherical?

865
01:01:50,490 --> 01:01:53,840
There's a reason. There's a what
for, for the ball bearings, whatnot.

866
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:54,750
For the planets.

867
01:01:57,790 --> 01:02:00,610
Why aren't asteroids spherical?

868
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:05,370
Why aren't dice satirical?

869
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:12,300
It was a how come for the asteroids
and what for, for the dice.

870
01:02:13,770 --> 01:02:18,770
What Darwin's brilliant permitted was
to how we move from a universe of planet

871
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:23,851
where there's only,

872
01:02:23,851 --> 01:02:27,990
how come there's no teleology to
a world in which there's what,

873
01:02:27,991 --> 01:02:32,991
four where things have purposes and
functions and that is itself a gradual

874
01:02:34,231 --> 01:02:35,064
process.

875
01:02:36,550 --> 01:02:37,100
Okay.

876
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:38,510
And I think he agrees with that.

877
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:43,030
Oh,
um,

878
01:02:43,270 --> 01:02:45,970
hi. Uh, I'm a, I'm a fan of yours.

879
01:02:45,971 --> 01:02:50,110
I'm also a fan of David Chalmers and I,

880
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:55,330
I sort of have a question for you. Maybe
you've kind of answered this already. Um,

881
01:02:55,960 --> 01:03:00,640
which like I, I'm curious
as to like when, uh,

882
01:03:00,970 --> 01:03:04,420
when something sort of becomes
like a moral agent, we're like,

883
01:03:04,421 --> 01:03:08,050
when you're not an agent but
rather like a patient, like when,

884
01:03:08,670 --> 01:03:12,000
when does something,
when does it have interests that matter?

885
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:14,723
Well,
that do

886
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:16,710
well, right. So,

887
01:03:17,370 --> 01:03:22,370
but I wonder though that like if I'm a
moral patient and I have like a nerve

888
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:28,210
which causes pain and I'm
trying to avoid that, uh,

889
01:03:28,330 --> 01:03:31,680
how's that different from like
a computer that I'm programming,

890
01:03:31,681 --> 01:03:36,600
which has like a cable on which,
you know, a signal is transmitted,

891
01:03:36,601 --> 01:03:41,520
which might be the pain signal of some
sort of mind that we don't comprehend

892
01:03:41,521 --> 01:03:42,354
yet.

893
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:48,470
Well, you know, um, we
addressed that very issue.

894
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:52,620
Um, in Rod Brooks lab when
we were building cog, what,

895
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:57,260
15 years ago, the humanoid robot, um,

896
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:03,520
and Carl had these motors that stuck
out of its elbows and they were a little

897
01:04:06,381 --> 01:04:11,330
bit fragile and we didn't want cognitive
be able to move at times so that it

898
01:04:11,331 --> 01:04:16,280
would, uh, uh, damaged them.
So we sort of gave it a,

899
01:04:16,370 --> 01:04:17,570
I gave her the funny bone

900
01:04:19,130 --> 01:04:23,870
so that if it ever did anything bumped,
it's these murders,

901
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:28,220
it sent an effect of pain signal.
It was an awesome, do that again.

902
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:32,480
So yeah,
we can have a functional,

903
01:04:33,050 --> 01:04:38,050
this was of course a top down designed
the system to give Kog the humanoid

904
01:04:40,070 --> 01:04:43,740
robot, a quiz.

905
01:04:43,790 --> 01:04:48,790
I equate I pain system because it had
some of the functions of a paint system.

906
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:56,530
And if we'd continued with that and
expanded it by many orders of magnitude,

907
01:04:57,650 --> 01:05:01,280
the project
made some wonderful progress,

908
01:05:01,281 --> 01:05:05,960
but you know,
not 1% of what you'd have to do.

909
01:05:06,330 --> 01:05:07,070
Um,

910
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:12,070
then eventually we would have had a robot
that would have interests and where it

911
01:05:12,740 --> 01:05:16,720
would be wrong to thwart,

912
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:21,070
thwart those interests. It would be
capable of something like suffering.

913
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:23,410
But we never got that far.

914
01:05:25,310 --> 01:05:26,400
Okay.
Thanks.

915
01:05:26,930 --> 01:05:29,360
But I don't think there's,
you mentioned traumas.

916
01:05:29,361 --> 01:05:34,361
I don't think there's a sort of extra
Zoe ingredient quality or something which

917
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:40,310
the living things have and the
things made of silicon don't have,

918
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:44,680
I think that's, uh, just
a bad idea. Well, I,

919
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:47,970
I think Tom,
I'm not saying Chalmers is right,

920
01:05:47,971 --> 01:05:49,920
but I think he would go
towards the direction of,

921
01:05:49,921 --> 01:05:54,000
even silicon has that like your pen
psychos him or something like that.

922
01:05:54,110 --> 01:05:55,560
But next, next, yeah.

923
01:05:56,760 --> 01:06:01,110
Panpsychism is the view that everything
is everything. Everything is conscious.

924
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:04,313
And I think,

925
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:09,640
I almost agree with it, but I, I just
got to change the view a little bit.

926
01:06:09,850 --> 01:06:12,610
I call my view Pan Nifty Islam,

927
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:18,670
everything is nifty. Have we, Adam
is nifty. Every electrons nifty.

928
01:06:19,450 --> 01:06:24,160
Now the question is, is
there any difference between
Panpsychism Pan, nifty Islam?

929
01:06:25,060 --> 01:06:27,370
They both explained the same things,
namely nothing.

930
01:06:27,930 --> 01:06:28,763
Okay.

931
01:06:30,670 --> 01:06:35,350
If you can tell me how panpsychism is
an improvement over Penn nifty ism,

932
01:06:36,010 --> 01:06:40,040
I'd be very interested to learn.
Well,

933
01:06:40,041 --> 01:06:42,860
it's because conscious things
are made out of conscious things.

934
01:06:45,110 --> 01:06:46,250
Oh really?
That's it.

935
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:50,360
Colored things aren't made
out of colored things.

936
01:06:52,580 --> 01:06:53,413
No.

937
01:06:55,050 --> 01:06:59,590
Yeah. Thanks for coming. Uh, honored that.
Sure. A year. I'm also a big fan. Uh,

938
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,880
you mentioned skin in the game and uh,

939
01:07:03,270 --> 01:07:06,470
the idea of building into, into, I dunno,

940
01:07:06,530 --> 01:07:08,950
into economics or into legal systems,
uh,

941
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:14,070
the incentives for makers
and users of tools to,

942
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:19,140
to have, to deal with the implications
of the tools of using those tools.

943
01:07:19,470 --> 01:07:23,430
But I was wondering, and I guess that's
more a question of politics or economics,

944
01:07:23,670 --> 01:07:28,590
how realistic that is. I am thinking
particularly of, uh, of, uh,

945
01:07:28,620 --> 01:07:32,910
I don't know, fake news,
alternative facts. The use
of media and social media to,

946
01:07:33,210 --> 01:07:36,120
to spread viral means intentionally to,

947
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:39,540
to provoke a human action.

948
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:44,180
To one direction or the
other. And uh, that is, I,

949
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:47,280
I feel that that is its own incentive.

950
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:51,630
The possibility of doing that is so
powerful that it's very hard at this stage

951
01:07:51,631 --> 01:07:55,640
to build limitations to do
that for simple things like,

952
01:07:55,740 --> 01:08:00,250
like Internet means misuse,
Internet meme, slat alone, uh, uh,

953
01:08:00,270 --> 01:08:02,000
AI tools or whatever like that. So, well,

954
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:05,520
I hear you.
I think this is,

955
01:08:06,090 --> 01:08:10,740
I think we underestimate how
serious these problems are.

956
01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:14,790
I don't share your pessimism,

957
01:08:15,950 --> 01:08:20,950
but I agree it's almost too late and we
ought to be thinking a lot harder and a

958
01:08:22,041 --> 01:08:27,041
lot faster and we ought to be acting more
to try to fend off the trends that we

959
01:08:28,101 --> 01:08:32,560
can see happening. I think that
really it is the response and boy,

960
01:08:33,090 --> 01:08:34,730
if there's any audience in the world,

961
01:08:34,731 --> 01:08:36,650
I want to spread this
message to a Psu folks

962
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:43,240
think very hard about what the
unintended consequences of some of the

963
01:08:43,461 --> 01:08:48,461
innovations are and whether there are
ways of steering them down more socially

964
01:08:49,911 --> 01:08:52,250
benign directions.
I think there are,

965
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:55,400
and I think the time is short,

966
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:01,220
but I think we should
get cracking on it now.

967
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:05,530
Okay. So there's, uh, just to
follow up shortly on that, uh,

968
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:09,250
it's there,
there's a,

969
01:09:09,251 --> 01:09:13,030
there's such a thing as a
personal interest in such a
thing as group interest in

970
01:09:13,031 --> 01:09:17,800
such a thing as like [inaudible]
interests, however defined society.

971
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:21,310
So is there's a bit of, uh, uh,

972
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,960
is there a bit of a conflict there
and how so you say we should do this,

973
01:09:25,961 --> 01:09:29,920
but of course for all of these situations
there's this personal interest by a

974
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:32,900
certain group. So I, I, I,

975
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:36,850
you're doing your part by spreading
the right meme site, I think. And, uh,

976
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:42,860
well thank you. Um, uh, I'm
certainly trying. Um, I think that

977
01:09:44,810 --> 01:09:46,760
actually one of the,

978
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:51,430
one of the most heartening
changes that I see on the, uh,

979
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:56,500
in the recent development is that now
that silicon valley is reducing all these,

980
01:09:59,860 --> 01:10:00,650
um,

981
01:10:00,650 --> 01:10:05,650
young plutocrats young billionaires
and a lot of them are really taking

982
01:10:07,491 --> 01:10:11,090
seriously the idea of putting,

983
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:15,890
putting that vast economic power
they have to socially benign,

984
01:10:16,710 --> 01:10:21,290
uh, projects and they're taking
seriously good intentions aren't enough.

985
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:26,920
They've got to figure out what you can
really mess things up by squandering a

986
01:10:27,441 --> 01:10:30,320
fortune with good
intentions on a bad idea.

987
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:33,800
And I think that this ideal

988
01:10:35,330 --> 01:10:36,890
of having,

989
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:42,160
taking it as a personal responsibility
to use this incredible economic power for

990
01:10:43,341 --> 01:10:47,660
good and the fact you,
you help each other do it better.

991
01:10:48,290 --> 01:10:52,010
This is one of the best
developments I've seen and

992
01:10:53,510 --> 01:10:58,510
we're not quite at the point where we
can start seriously shaming those who

993
01:10:59,691 --> 01:11:02,420
don't treat their wealth that way.

994
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:06,710
And I don't think we're going to have to,
it shaming doesn't usually work anyway,

995
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:09,110
but if we can

996
01:11:10,730 --> 01:11:13,130
make them feel like they're
sort of second class,

997
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:18,570
then this would be a stepped forward.
Thank you.

998
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:21,480
Yeah.

999
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:25,020
Hi. I want to ask you about, uh,
I guess language and kind of the,

1000
01:11:25,021 --> 01:11:28,380
the limits there of it and try to get
a little bit at a tension that I think

1001
01:11:29,190 --> 01:11:31,980
came up in your talk. So this
is a little bit about, uh,

1002
01:11:31,981 --> 01:11:35,190
the Chomsky criticism that you give
and a little bit about sort of the,

1003
01:11:35,191 --> 01:11:39,450
the tension between Anglo American
analytic philosophy and the European

1004
01:11:39,550 --> 01:11:43,860
continental tradition. So it
sounds like on the one hand, um,

1005
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:49,410
your, your um, your challenging
Chomsky and saying that, uh,

1006
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:49,831
that you know,

1007
01:11:49,831 --> 01:11:54,330
reason in language kind of has a mapping
to the real world that we can explain

1008
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:59,270
and that there's, there isn't, there
isn't really a limit to language, right?

1009
01:11:59,310 --> 01:12:01,570
These mysteries don't exist.
They're not beyond human thought.

1010
01:12:01,590 --> 01:12:04,320
They're not beyond perception
or methods of expressing them.

1011
01:12:04,710 --> 01:12:08,100
But then at the end of your talk when you
started talking about, uh, the dangers,

1012
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:11,760
at least what I perceive as you've
mentioned and the dangers of AI about

1013
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,880
competence without comprehension,
it sounds to me like the,

1014
01:12:14,890 --> 01:12:19,470
the fear there actually is very much
that it's encroaching on the head Germany

1015
01:12:19,471 --> 01:12:20,670
of language, right? That we,

1016
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:25,710
what we don't want to happen is to have
meaning or something extra, you know,

1017
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:28,470
act like outside of the scope of meaning.
Um,

1018
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:30,660
that that kind of messes up
our whole calculus, right?

1019
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:35,060
Morality stops making sense. Epistemology
stops making sense. Ontology like the,

1020
01:12:35,070 --> 01:12:39,180
that these concepts and things that we
say are so had demonic and really do have

1021
01:12:39,181 --> 01:12:42,690
this very concrete mapping to
physical things starts to go away.

1022
01:12:43,050 --> 01:12:44,520
And so I'm curious,
you know,

1023
01:12:44,550 --> 01:12:48,750
kind of sounds like you're saying both
things that on the one hand there's a

1024
01:12:48,751 --> 01:12:52,230
danger to like meaning escaping us.
And then on the other hand,

1025
01:12:52,590 --> 01:12:54,210
we actually have had Germany over this.

1026
01:12:54,820 --> 01:12:55,653
That's good.

1027
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:03,750
I hadn't thought of tying it to the
different between no continental and the

1028
01:13:04,931 --> 01:13:08,820
Anglo phone analytic philosophy,
uh,

1029
01:13:12,370 --> 01:13:16,780
aside from thinking that
with a few exceptions,

1030
01:13:17,910 --> 01:13:22,910
the anglophone philosophers are
not postmodernists and don't,

1031
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:28,520
and it's still have a proper
respect for truth facts.

1032
01:13:31,410 --> 01:13:36,410
And I think that the damage done by
postmodernist to the very ideal of

1033
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:43,180
objectivity and truth is that's vandalism.

1034
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:46,090
And one thing I said,
which I maybe didn't stress enough

1035
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:53,280
at this time,
let's look at science.

1036
01:13:56,770 --> 01:14:00,400
Do you have competition out
who can make the cheapest,

1037
01:14:00,401 --> 01:14:02,200
fastest gene sequencer?

1038
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:09,000
And it's getting really cheap and fast
and you just push the buttons and it's

1039
01:14:09,581 --> 01:14:12,250
like, it's like a TV. You just, you know,

1040
01:14:12,251 --> 01:14:16,380
put it in the microwave and push
the button and out it comes. Uh,

1041
01:14:16,390 --> 01:14:20,620
it's amazing how much of that process,
which,

1042
01:14:21,430 --> 01:14:23,740
which took genius.

1043
01:14:25,430 --> 01:14:26,020
Okay.

1044
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:29,110
Which took brilliant drudgery by,

1045
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:34,260
by Nobel laureate scientist to
do within my adult lifetime.

1046
01:14:36,850 --> 01:14:40,950
And now you just push a
button and you get it. Uh,

1047
01:14:41,290 --> 01:14:42,123
but look at,

1048
01:14:42,250 --> 01:14:47,250
so there's competition among different
makers of gene sequencing machinery and w

1049
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:51,940
w what's the benchmark?

1050
01:14:52,390 --> 01:14:55,660
Why do you buy unit a rather than unity?
Cause you know,

1051
01:14:56,740 --> 01:15:00,160
well maybe cause it's cheaper,
but not if it's not as accurate.

1052
01:15:01,570 --> 01:15:01,850
Okay.

1053
01:15:01,850 --> 01:15:05,580
Truth really matters.
It's,

1054
01:15:05,690 --> 01:15:07,430
it is a,

1055
01:15:07,610 --> 01:15:10,790
it is a design in the same way that,

1056
01:15:11,060 --> 01:15:12,830
hmm.
Uh,

1057
01:15:14,130 --> 01:15:19,020
fuel efficiency or safety or
design requirements for cars.

1058
01:15:19,530 --> 01:15:24,530
So getting it right is
taken for granted as a,

1059
01:15:25,230 --> 01:15:30,230
as a requirement for the
scientific black boxes or,

1060
01:15:31,681 --> 01:15:33,020
you know,
getting it right with a high,

1061
01:15:33,030 --> 01:15:37,020
a high degree of reliability
of the probability now.

1062
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:38,373
Mm.

1063
01:15:38,490 --> 01:15:40,710
I can't yet.

1064
01:15:42,410 --> 01:15:45,570
I don't know of any black boxes

1065
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:48,400
that are

1066
01:15:49,470 --> 01:15:54,470
trying to avoid that and are
just trying to make memes.

1067
01:15:58,420 --> 01:16:01,260
It'll spread truth be damned,

1068
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:07,460
a utility be down. But maybe there are,
in which case that's a very ominous

1069
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:11,120
development.
Well,

1070
01:16:13,690 --> 01:16:15,100
on that apolitical,
no

1071
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:20,360
thank you.

1072
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:24,600
[inaudible].
