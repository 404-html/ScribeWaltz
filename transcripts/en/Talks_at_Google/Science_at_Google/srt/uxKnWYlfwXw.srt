1
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:11,110
Jim costa traveled to us from western
North Carolina and despite the impacts of

2
00:00:11,121 --> 00:00:14,270
Hurricane Irma and many delays,
he made it in late last night.

3
00:00:14,271 --> 00:00:15,620
So we're glad to have him here.

4
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:20,450
James t Costa is a professor of biology
at Western Carolina University and

5
00:00:20,451 --> 00:00:25,451
Executive Director of the highlands
biological station and a trustee of the

6
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:28,940
Charles Darwin Trust. He lives in the
Blue Ridge mountains of North Carolina.

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,040
In his book, Darwin's backyard, how
small experiments led to a big theory.

8
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:38,540
He goes beyond the portrait of Charles
Darwin as a brilliant thinker to

9
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:43,130
concentrate on him as a
nimble experimenter delving
into some of evolutions.

10
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:46,550
Greatest mysteries. Please join
me in welcoming professor Costa.

11
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:55,430
Thank you all for being here. It's really
a special pleasure. Um, I have, you know,

12
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,740
a deep connection with Cambridge,

13
00:00:57,741 --> 00:01:01,100
but I've never had the pleasure
of visiting your office is here,

14
00:01:01,101 --> 00:01:04,610
so this has been great
seeing the place with you. So
thanks. Thanks so much. And a,

15
00:01:04,611 --> 00:01:07,130
I do appreciate your being
here and, um, you know,

16
00:01:07,131 --> 00:01:11,000
allowing me to share one of my passions.
You know, my background is entomology,

17
00:01:11,001 --> 00:01:14,990
but some years ago it became pretty
interested in the history of evolutionary

18
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:18,440
thinking. And a lot of my work in
recent years has been on Darwin.

19
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,590
Alfred Russell Wallace has fellow
naturalist of the 19th century. And, um,

20
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:25,670
I became intrigued by, you
know, what we, what, what,

21
00:01:25,671 --> 00:01:29,030
what lessons Darwin might still
hold for us today. You know,

22
00:01:29,031 --> 00:01:33,740
kind of understanding how he came
to his yeah. His ideas. And, um,

23
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,960
some years ago I worked on an annotated
version of on the origin of species and,

24
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:42,500
and working on that project, I,
I came to realize that, you know,

25
00:01:42,501 --> 00:01:45,750
a whole lot of the arguments
and the origin are,

26
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,610
are based on these often
really quirky experiments,

27
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:51,470
like literally backyard experiments.

28
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,380
And I became fascinated
by that side of Darwin,

29
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:57,590
especially because the Darwin that I saw,
you know,

30
00:01:57,591 --> 00:01:59,150
as you get to know this individual,

31
00:01:59,151 --> 00:02:03,920
the flesh and blood person a really
seemed at odds with the, you know,

32
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:07,910
Darwin, the icon Darwin
that, um, you know, the,

33
00:02:07,911 --> 00:02:10,210
this is the kind of Darwin
that most people think of you,

34
00:02:10,211 --> 00:02:13,140
do you think you think of these portraits.
And he said,

35
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:17,450
this is the melancholy Darwin, this is the
sad Darwin, maybe the tormented Darwin.

36
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,560
Um, the, you know, uh, I believe
that what we're seeing here,

37
00:02:21,561 --> 00:02:23,840
this kind of cardboard cutout,
you know,

38
00:02:23,841 --> 00:02:27,580
icon that seems rather rather melancholy,
um,

39
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,420
is really more,
you know,

40
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:34,070
w w w more insightful may be a Victorian
portraiture conventions or limitations

41
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:37,460
of the photographic technology of the day
where you're not going to hold a smile

42
00:02:37,461 --> 00:02:40,210
for many long minutes. Um, really, I,

43
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,630
I came to appreciate this impish
side of Darwin. I saw this Darwin as,

44
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,950
um, as a dad, as a husband, as a friend,

45
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:54,110
as a jokester, a practical joker, you
know, so about sort of twinkle in his eye.

46
00:02:54,111 --> 00:02:57,530
And I want to, you know,
um, share with you, um,

47
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:02,500
this idea of what Darwin did literally
in his backyard. Um, and how, you know,

48
00:03:02,501 --> 00:03:07,240
the, the, how those activities kind
of give us a, uh, what I think is a,

49
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:12,100
is a much more, um, accurate portrait
of the human being. You know, Darwin,

50
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:13,450
the person,
and as you'll see,

51
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,990
my secondary interest in this project
wasn't just a humanized Darwin,

52
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:20,470
but also as an educator,
as a scientist myself. Um,

53
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,740
I became interested in the
ways in which Darwin, uh,

54
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:28,360
and his method could be harnessed
pedagogically. We can use that,

55
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:29,140
um,

56
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,010
at really any level from kindergarteners
up to college students and really use

57
00:03:33,011 --> 00:03:37,300
the way he approached understanding
the natural world. Um, as a,

58
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:40,420
as an interesting novel way
to approach science education.

59
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:45,280
I'm teaching about ecology, evolution,
scientific inquiry, those sorts of things.

60
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,470
So,
so this is a portrait,

61
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:50,860
really have a rather different kinds of
Darwin than I think most of you would be

62
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:55,640
familiar with. In all likelihood.
This is one, a quote from Darwin. Um,

63
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,290
in his self deprecating way. He would
talk about his fullest experiments.

64
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,730
He loves fools experiments.

65
00:04:00,731 --> 00:04:04,900
He's always making them and that kind of
gives them insight into what he's up to,

66
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:10,060
the backstory to Darwin's books
as experiment after experiment.

67
00:04:10,061 --> 00:04:13,030
Some of them very quirky, um, on the fly,

68
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,690
literally done at home because famously
he became something of a home body and

69
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:21,490
did not travel much after his,
around the world voyage on HMS Beagle.

70
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,530
And I want to give you sort of have
some insight into Darwin again, uh,

71
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,720
as a family man. Uh, and
the way that his family,

72
00:04:28,721 --> 00:04:32,950
his kids played a role in many
of these quirky experiments.

73
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:36,280
Some Darwin, um, had 10 children,

74
00:04:36,281 --> 00:04:41,100
seven of whom survived to
adulthood and throughout their, um,

75
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,070
their upbringing,

76
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,280
they're constantly involved in dad's
activities and a as well as his wife,

77
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:53,110
Emma, as well as nieces and nephews.
Um, you know, the extended family.

78
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:57,490
And so, you know, there are
some interesting, um, you know,

79
00:04:57,491 --> 00:05:00,100
little snippets of,
you know,

80
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:03,280
getting some sense of how the kids
were involved at different times.

81
00:05:03,281 --> 00:05:07,410
So one anecdote for example that's
pretty well substantiated, you know, uh,

82
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,410
comes from one of the kids who, you know,
for about an eight year period, Darwin,

83
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,760
um, famously, you know, immersed himself
in the study of Barnacles of all things.

84
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,600
And so for at least one of the kids
their whole life as they were growing up,

85
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,320
they knew nothing.

86
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,190
My Dad working on barnacles and the story
goes that visiting some friends, um,

87
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,730
the, you know, they kind of looked,
looked around and wondering, well,

88
00:05:27,731 --> 00:05:30,520
where does your dad do? Is
Barnacles, you know, um, like every,

89
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:35,020
every kid's dad must work on Barnacles,
you know, is the idea. And, um, you know,

90
00:05:35,021 --> 00:05:39,820
some of their studies, some of their
investigations were just, you know, fun,

91
00:05:39,821 --> 00:05:44,410
but always an interesting scientific point
behind them. So one episode involved,

92
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:48,400
I'm chasing around Bumblebees,
which we now understand male bees,

93
00:05:48,401 --> 00:05:52,150
trap lining pheromonal the leading
trails kind of through an area.

94
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:55,660
They had no idea. Pheromones had not
been discovered yet at this time.

95
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,420
And they're running around and marketing
bs with flour to make them more visible.

96
00:05:59,421 --> 00:06:00,110
And,
um,

97
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,500
it was just really quite a
family adventure to try to
understand what are these

98
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:06,740
bees doing?
It was the mystery of the buzzing places.

99
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,790
One of the kids later reminisced
that at that time, you know,

100
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:14,470
that his father was like a boy
amongst other boys. Um, and,

101
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,610
and I think that that says a lot.
This is,

102
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,430
and I think all of you can
perhaps appreciate this.

103
00:06:19,431 --> 00:06:22,250
There's a certain childish enthusiasm,

104
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:27,200
a sense of wonder and enthusiasm about
something interesting in the natural

105
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:30,050
world.
And then trying to under understand it.

106
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,310
Here's just one other little example
of involving the kids. Um, this,

107
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,163
this is from a,

108
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:41,000
you can imagine maybe little
red periodical called the
entomologists to weekly

109
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:44,320
Intelligencer. You know, you can
imagine, you know, that every house,

110
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:47,000
all it must be reading this
magazine. So, you know,

111
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:51,200
here you've got a little note about
the f the capture of some rare beetles.

112
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:56,240
And this is obviously dad
writing the note, but signing it,

113
00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:01,190
three of the kids, right? Frances
Lennard and Horace Darwin, ages 11,

114
00:07:01,191 --> 00:07:05,180
nine and eight. And so that you can
sort of envision, that's the proud dad.

115
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:09,680
He loved Beatles himself on these quite
a beetle collector. And just very proud,

116
00:07:09,681 --> 00:07:13,400
I think that his kids were,
you know, really into Beatles
too and collecting them.

117
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:15,980
And, um, so he fires off
this little note, you know,

118
00:07:15,981 --> 00:07:19,730
to the weekly and entomologists weekly
intelligence are pretty interesting.

119
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:25,770
So those are little, little snippets, you
know, Darwin, uh, at his home, um, in,

120
00:07:25,771 --> 00:07:30,320
in Kent Down House had a thinking path.
This is his thinking path.

121
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:34,970
And um, he would famously, you
know, put a few stones at one,

122
00:07:34,971 --> 00:07:39,170
at one end of the thinking path and kick
them away as he made his rounds and the

123
00:07:39,171 --> 00:07:41,120
kids would go and replace them.

124
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:44,210
Really wanting to keep them going longer
because there was always something

125
00:07:44,211 --> 00:07:46,250
interesting to be found.
Um,

126
00:07:46,251 --> 00:07:49,740
so I think that the thinking path
is a good place to start, you know,

127
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:53,390
in talking about Darwin's
experiments and they are fun.

128
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:57,860
A lot of his experiments are really
just genuinely fun, you know,

129
00:07:57,861 --> 00:07:59,990
rather quirky,
rather odd always.

130
00:07:59,991 --> 00:08:04,310
There's an interesting scientific
question behind them as well. We'll,

131
00:08:04,311 --> 00:08:08,720
we'll discuss. Um, they are accessible,
you know, and this is interesting too.

132
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:12,950
I mean, Darwin working in the Victorian
period, literally at his home,

133
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:13,970
he's,

134
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:18,170
he's not working with sophisticated
scientific instrumentation maybe beyond a

135
00:08:18,171 --> 00:08:21,680
microscope on really,
his experiments are done on the fly.

136
00:08:21,681 --> 00:08:26,390
He's just pulling together,
you know, whatever materials
are at hand at the house,

137
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:31,400
and then devising a way to test some
scientific question that actually makes us

138
00:08:31,401 --> 00:08:35,050
experiments eminently accessible today,
right?

139
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:38,420
We don't need sophisticated
scientific instruments, for example,

140
00:08:38,421 --> 00:08:42,890
precision instruments in order to
actually engage in meaningful scientific

141
00:08:42,891 --> 00:08:44,120
inquiry necessarily.

142
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:48,710
And there's interesting implications for
teaching scientific inquiry, I think. Um,

143
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,090
and of course adaptable.

144
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,470
I think that any of these experiments
and the questions behind them are adapted

145
00:08:54,471 --> 00:08:59,100
to virtually any age group. They, some of
them are adaptable to kindergarten age.

146
00:08:59,101 --> 00:09:00,120
Some of them,
you know,

147
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:04,050
there were layers of sophistication
where you can get into more sophisticated

148
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,540
considerations like replication
or concepts like, um,

149
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:11,760
statistical significance at the college
level perhaps or high school level. Um,

150
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,680
so scalable and adaptable,

151
00:09:13,681 --> 00:09:18,240
which I think also makes them
eminently interesting. Um, from a,

152
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:21,090
from an educational point
of view today. Right. So,

153
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:24,600
so what was the experiment sizing,
you know, really all about? Well,

154
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,330
first and foremost about curiosity,
right?

155
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:31,830
It all starts with curiosity about the
natural world, natural phenomena, pattern,

156
00:09:31,831 --> 00:09:34,770
process. Um, but ultimately
as I'll show you,

157
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,280
Darwin became very keen on really,
um,

158
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:43,320
not just demonstrating the voracity of
his ideas about evolutionary change and

159
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:47,910
the mechanism of natural selection,
but ultimately extending that paradigm.

160
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:52,980
And so many of his research programs
are really intended to flesh out,

161
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:54,030
um,

162
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:58,380
reconfirm and extend his
evolutionary insights as we'll see.

163
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,890
So editors is what he's looking for.
Um,

164
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,430
if any of you have read on the
origin of species, you may,

165
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,190
you may recall that near
the end of the book,

166
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:13,191
Darwin refers to the book as one long
argument and it hangs together in an

167
00:10:14,491 --> 00:10:16,410
interesting way,
many different subjects.

168
00:10:16,411 --> 00:10:19,470
And I became fascinated by the fact that,
you know,

169
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,400
there's another book behind the book
behind the one long argument and that book

170
00:10:23,401 --> 00:10:26,880
is this one, right? His experiment
book is experiment notebook.

171
00:10:26,881 --> 00:10:30,900
This is the book that he committed,
um, many, many observations,

172
00:10:30,901 --> 00:10:35,460
experimental results, musings and so
on. And I'll give me just, you know,

173
00:10:35,461 --> 00:10:37,410
there's so much that could be discussed.

174
00:10:37,411 --> 00:10:40,770
I'm just going to give you
one example of an Eh, uh,

175
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,990
a research area that had,

176
00:10:42,991 --> 00:10:47,980
that really shows off the different
facets of Darwin's, um, method and,

177
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:52,470
and his interests. So, so, and that, that
is that, that example will be dispersal,

178
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,010
take dispersal. That is the question
of geographical distribution.

179
00:10:56,011 --> 00:10:59,460
How do species become distributed
on the earth as we see them?

180
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,770
And he undertook,
you know,

181
00:11:01,771 --> 00:11:06,771
just a diversity of weird and wonderful
experiments to gather data to answer

182
00:11:07,321 --> 00:11:11,460
questions that often we would just say,
well, of course, or that must be obvious,

183
00:11:11,461 --> 00:11:16,410
but if there were no data, nobody really
knew. So he, you have to start somewhere.

184
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,760
So he,
so for example,

185
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:22,170
this is just a list of some of the
quirky experiments that he undertook,

186
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:25,980
you know, bomb seeds and
salt water seed, buoyancy,

187
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:30,840
hitchhiker experiments with duck's feet,
you know, Dunkin ducks and, and you know,

188
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:35,790
Aquaria with duckweed and,
and so on. So, so for example,

189
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:40,800
um, Galapagos Islands, right? Remote
Oceanic Islands loom large, uh, in,

190
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:45,040
in, in talking about Darwin and the
history of evolution. Um, so, but,

191
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:49,610
but it begs a question, any remote island
system begs the question, you know, what,

192
00:11:49,611 --> 00:11:54,130
how new species get there. Exactly. It's
easy enough to see that might be blown,

193
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:58,120
you know, far off course or you
know, other winged animals. Um,

194
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:01,210
but really there's a lot of other
organisms besides things that can fly.

195
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,280
How do they get there? Well, you know,

196
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:06,850
maybe they raft or they float or
they can be carried in some way,

197
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:11,660
but how exactly. Darwin was convinced
that an whole lot of these organisms,

198
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,700
seeds and such actually floated
some of them just in salt water,

199
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:18,670
some of them rafting. Um,
but his, his colleagues,

200
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:21,940
his friends and colleagues who are
generally supportive of him, um,

201
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,200
really were dubious of this.

202
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:27,400
They didn't think that seeds could
possibly survive exposure to salt water,

203
00:12:27,401 --> 00:12:31,150
you know, so what to do, but you
know, tests to demonstrate this.

204
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:33,520
And Darwin never did anything by halves.

205
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:38,200
So he embarked upon a two
year investigation, floating
seeds and salt water.

206
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:41,110
And not just an end of,
you know, two or three,

207
00:12:41,111 --> 00:12:44,680
but really just taking over the house,
you know, just said, you know, you know,

208
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:49,330
jar after jar of saltwater with seeds
of, you know, Marian species, you know,

209
00:12:49,331 --> 00:12:52,690
he fills up the cellar, you know,
he fills up his study. Um, the,

210
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:57,540
the object was to see, we'll, how long can
see survive exposure to salt water. Um,

211
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,520
so you would take samples periodically.
Can they survive a week?

212
00:13:00,521 --> 00:13:04,840
Can they survive two weeks, a month,
two months, five months. And you know,

213
00:13:04,841 --> 00:13:08,050
the kids were very excited because
his good friend Joseph Hooker,

214
00:13:08,051 --> 00:13:10,210
the botanist was very dubious of this.

215
00:13:10,211 --> 00:13:14,230
He didn't think that anything would
come of it. Um, so the kids got in on,

216
00:13:14,231 --> 00:13:17,890
you know, they saw it as a contest
and in one letter to hooker,

217
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:21,730
he reported that the children were very
eager and asked Tim often whether he

218
00:13:21,731 --> 00:13:25,570
would beat Dr Hooker and show him yet,
yes, they can survive in saltwater,

219
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:26,650
you know, yes, that can't happen.

220
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,760
Then there's the inconvenience of
hooker kind of pointing out that, well,

221
00:13:30,761 --> 00:13:34,450
they might be able to survive in
saltwater, but oftentimes they sink.

222
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,270
And so it's a moot point whether
they can survive in saltwater,

223
00:13:37,271 --> 00:13:39,340
they're never gonna make it to
an island if they're sinking.

224
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:43,270
And I'm in another letter, you know,
he writes to hooker, his, you know,

225
00:13:43,271 --> 00:13:47,110
you see his exasperations, you know, the
gift, the con founded seeds will sink.

226
00:13:47,111 --> 00:13:51,070
I've been taking all this
trouble, insulting the
ungrateful rascals for nothing,

227
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:55,690
right? The letters, you know,
his, his diary, the letters,

228
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,670
um,
his notebooks,

229
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:01,480
they really are this
phenomenal window into Darwin,

230
00:14:01,481 --> 00:14:05,620
the person and the working method. And
so here you see, you know, um, you know,

231
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,770
you can try on and then set backs.
You know,

232
00:14:08,771 --> 00:14:13,520
what does he do in the face
of sinking seeds? Well, you
know, let's try dry seeds.

233
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:17,350
Let's try flow. I'm drying
vegetation, let's try fruits.

234
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:21,580
And so these are just pages
from the experiment book
where species after species,

235
00:14:21,581 --> 00:14:24,780
after species, he's testing them
and trying to see, you know,

236
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,610
how long will they float? A,
how long will seed survive.

237
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:30,880
Ultimately this all makes it into,
on the origin of species.

238
00:14:30,881 --> 00:14:34,720
He is able to show that they could survive
some many of these species months at

239
00:14:34,721 --> 00:14:39,130
a time. Ocean currents can carry them
thousands of miles. He's, you know,

240
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:44,140
triumphantly saying this is a viable means
for getting species to remote oceanic

241
00:14:44,711 --> 00:14:49,060
islands. As unlikely as it may
be, it clearly must happen, right?

242
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,320
Um, in the book, you know,

243
00:14:51,321 --> 00:14:55,280
each chapter ends with a kind of do it
yourself section where you can sort of

244
00:14:55,281 --> 00:14:58,610
experiment ties all La
Darwin. You can, for example,

245
00:14:58,611 --> 00:15:02,660
replicates some of his seed salting
experiments. And, um, do you know,

246
00:15:02,661 --> 00:15:05,660
is it's great fun. I've done this with
science educators. I've done it with,

247
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:10,610
with my kids and other kids. Um, I've done
it with my students and, uh, you know,

248
00:15:10,611 --> 00:15:11,720
again,
it's not just fun,

249
00:15:11,721 --> 00:15:15,020
but actually there is this interesting
point about better understanding,

250
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,030
you know, geographical distribution,
dispersal of species on the planet,

251
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:23,390
and you think about it, lakes and
ponds are like islands on the land.

252
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,800
How do aquatic organisms get around
from lake to lake pond to pond? Well,

253
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:30,200
logically you might think, well
they're, maybe they're carry,

254
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:35,230
cause clearly little aquatic snails are
not leaving a pond to go miles and miles

255
00:15:35,451 --> 00:15:39,170
to another pond. Right? Probably
they're carried. Well, once again,

256
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,390
it's our been thought of that,
but there were no data,

257
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:45,530
there was just no information one way or
another. So, so, so what does he do? Well,

258
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:49,760
well, he devises a test that
uses actual duck's feet, right?

259
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,440
Presumably they're eating these ducts,

260
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:56,470
he's saving the legs and then dangling
the legs in Aquaria full of snails to see

261
00:15:56,991 --> 00:15:58,880
if the snails will hop aboard the feet.

262
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:03,380
He's imagining that sleeping ducks in
lakes, uh, as the feet are dangling down,

263
00:16:03,381 --> 00:16:07,370
snails will become hitchhikers in the
morning. They're duck wakes up off.

264
00:16:07,371 --> 00:16:12,200
It flies maybe hundreds of miles carrying
the snail with it, you know. So, um,

265
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,910
I devise, of course we, you know,

266
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:17,780
in my version we're not going to
use real duck feet. Um, but we have,

267
00:16:17,781 --> 00:16:20,390
there's a way to make a model
duck foot out of a dowel in a,

268
00:16:20,391 --> 00:16:24,050
in a bobber or some kind of a float
and you know, a fabric duck foot.

269
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,360
And actually this is one of my kids here.

270
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:29,650
We're actually sort of casting
for hitchhikers, you know, in,

271
00:16:29,651 --> 00:16:34,100
in ponds and it's amazing actually what
you will catch kind of casting duck's

272
00:16:34,101 --> 00:16:36,840
feet in ponds, all odd Darwin. So it's a,

273
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:41,060
it's really a great way to get young
people engaged with these scientific

274
00:16:41,061 --> 00:16:45,230
questions. Now this is a general subject
that also says something about Darwin,

275
00:16:45,231 --> 00:16:49,280
the crowdsource or I think he's maybe
the original crowd sourcer, you know,

276
00:16:49,281 --> 00:16:51,710
these are just four letters to the editor,

277
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:56,360
open letters that he published in
1855 as one example, where again,

278
00:16:56,361 --> 00:17:00,590
he's wondering about seeds surviving
and salt water. He's wondering,

279
00:17:00,591 --> 00:17:04,340
has anyone ever looked at this? Are
there any data? Is there any information?

280
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,140
So publishing open letters,

281
00:17:06,141 --> 00:17:09,770
will any of your readers a be so kind
as to inform me whether it's such

282
00:17:09,771 --> 00:17:13,880
experiments? I've already been tried,
he's exhorting readers of this magazine,

283
00:17:13,881 --> 00:17:18,070
the Gardener's chronicle, try this
experiment, send me your results. Um,

284
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:22,430
ultimately several people took him up on
this and they're cited in the origin of

285
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:25,580
species actually. So it's pretty,
pretty interesting. Um, so he's,

286
00:17:25,581 --> 00:17:29,180
he's crowdsourcing here and he does this
to good effect with quite a few other

287
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,890
other subjects as well.

288
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:35,810
He's also open to the two rather
unorthodox approaches to the question.

289
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:39,150
And here's yet another facet.
Here's one of the kids, um,

290
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,710
little Francis or he as he was
called when he was eight years old,

291
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:46,820
came up with an experiment and
it seems a little crazy. So,

292
00:17:46,821 --> 00:17:51,480
but here's Darwin reporting this to
his buddy Joseph Hooker. He says, look,

293
00:17:51,481 --> 00:17:54,540
I must tell you another of my
profound experiments. You know,

294
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:57,930
he's sort of very tongue in cheek
about how profound it is. He says,

295
00:17:57,931 --> 00:17:58,890
Frankie says to me,

296
00:17:58,891 --> 00:18:03,840
why shouldn't a bird imagine a Burg
with seeds in its crop killed by hail or

297
00:18:03,841 --> 00:18:08,730
lightening or something over the open
ocean and then the carcasses floating and

298
00:18:08,731 --> 00:18:13,530
eventually is kind of washed up on a
distant shore and has fertilizer built in,

299
00:18:13,531 --> 00:18:17,040
right with the rotting carcass. And
wouldn't that be a dispersal mechanism?

300
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:22,110
So where does Darwin say no sooner
said than done? He takes a poor pigeon,

301
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,153
right?
Um,

302
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:27,210
we've got seeds in the crop and this poor
pigeon is killed and is floating in a

303
00:18:27,211 --> 00:18:29,040
salt water tank for 30 days.

304
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:33,460
And then Darwin is able to report once
the plants it, ah, the seeds, they,

305
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:37,680
they germinated splendidly
right data, right. Um,

306
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,140
very interesting.
Well,

307
00:18:40,141 --> 00:18:44,010
a whole different area of interest
to him had to do with field botany.

308
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,670
And um, here's this was from
another letter. You know,

309
00:18:47,671 --> 00:18:50,760
if you ever catch quite a beginner,
I want to give them a taste for botany.

310
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,060
Haven't make a perfect list
of some little field or wood.

311
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,950
And he speaks from experience here.

312
00:18:55,951 --> 00:19:00,330
He really was passionate about botany
and he had listed the help of Catherine

313
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,970
Thorley, who is the governess
of the kids, call him,

314
00:19:02,971 --> 00:19:06,960
had a talent for botany and very
keen on helping with experiments.

315
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,310
So they would botanize and try to
characterize the diversity in sent areas,

316
00:19:11,311 --> 00:19:15,480
really a forerunner runner of the modern
quadrant approach to doing botanical

317
00:19:15,481 --> 00:19:20,280
surveys. Um, here you see glimpses
in the letter of his sense of humor.

318
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:24,450
Um, like for example, when he identified
his first grass, which botanically can be,

319
00:19:24,451 --> 00:19:28,050
they can be very difficult to identify
and he says, Hurrah, Hurrah. You know,

320
00:19:28,051 --> 00:19:31,230
I never expected to make out of
grass in my life, you know. Well,

321
00:19:31,231 --> 00:19:35,670
what's interesting about these experiments
with Miss Thorley is that they are

322
00:19:35,671 --> 00:19:40,671
the forerunners of experiments that are
now considered to be foundational in

323
00:19:42,031 --> 00:19:43,890
modern ecology and evolution.

324
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:49,130
So modern ecological concepts that you'll
find in any introductory bio textbook,

325
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,970
any introductory ecology course. And the
students learn about niche partitioning,

326
00:19:53,971 --> 00:19:57,030
competitive exclusion, um,
they learned about, um,

327
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,530
on demographic analysis and
Population and population pressure.

328
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,450
Though those insights came
from these simple experiments.

329
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:10,500
And as you can see in the upper right
here, literally in Darwin's backyard,

330
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:14,220
this is down house and he's
has a three by four plot, uh,

331
00:20:14,221 --> 00:20:16,810
where he is conducting experiments.
Um,

332
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:20,220
the so called lawn plot
where he mo's all around,

333
00:20:20,221 --> 00:20:24,810
but he leaves the unknown plot just
to watch the dynamics of the different

334
00:20:24,811 --> 00:20:26,460
species that come and go.

335
00:20:26,461 --> 00:20:29,490
He sort of chronicling that
and he wants to document the,

336
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:34,140
he has a hypothesis about the relationship
of the different species that end up

337
00:20:34,141 --> 00:20:34,861
coexisting.

338
00:20:34,861 --> 00:20:39,750
The phyletic diversity packed into a
very small geographical area or the weed

339
00:20:39,751 --> 00:20:44,100
garden where he clears the plot completely
and marks every seedling as it comes

340
00:20:44,101 --> 00:20:45,720
up.
Essentially it is,

341
00:20:45,721 --> 00:20:50,470
it is a modern demographic
study he's looking at, um,

342
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,350
at the mortality rate of these plants.

343
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:58,270
And he documents the on the extreme
what he calls of course the struggle for

344
00:20:58,271 --> 00:21:00,620
existence, the mortality rate, um,

345
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:04,690
that ends up reinforcing his arguments
about how natural selection works.

346
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:09,900
So I find it fascinating that
those cornerstone ecological
principles today have

347
00:21:10,091 --> 00:21:13,580
their origin in these simple backyard
experiments. And again, you know,

348
00:21:13,581 --> 00:21:18,230
anybody can duplicate these experiments
that I think it's actually great fun, um,

349
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:22,540
to take Darwin's original data and then
compare that with with one's own data.

350
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:27,160
I'm doing these, these different law
and plots or, or we'd gardens. Well,

351
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,860
if the origin is one long argument,

352
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,550
consider that the origin was far
from Darwin's last book, right?

353
00:21:33,551 --> 00:21:37,900
There's another dozen or so books,
uh, after on the origin of species.

354
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,870
About half a dozen of them
on botanical subjects.

355
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:44,380
Every one of these books
has interesting experiments.

356
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:49,390
Some of them pioneering where Darwin
made fundamental discoveries, um, in,

357
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:54,130
um, in different aspects of ecology,
evolution, botany, behavior. These are,

358
00:21:54,131 --> 00:21:58,330
this is just a sampler of, of topics, you
know, orchids, Barnacles, inheritance,

359
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:01,870
you know, the construction of B
cells, expression of emotions,

360
00:22:01,871 --> 00:22:03,250
pollination mechanisms.

361
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:07,540
He's often juggling multiple
experimental areas at the same time,

362
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:12,220
which is interesting in its own right.
Planting experimental gardens in his yard.

363
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,870
Eventually building a greenhouse.

364
00:22:13,871 --> 00:22:17,590
This is Darwin's greenhouse where he
would keep climbing plants, orchids,

365
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,630
carnivorous plants.
And so on.

366
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:23,230
His first book after the
origin was on orchids in fact,

367
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:27,320
and he was fascinated by
the different contrivances,

368
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:32,340
the highly derived adaptations of orchids
and their pollination relationship

369
00:22:32,381 --> 00:22:33,610
with insects,
often one,

370
00:22:33,611 --> 00:22:37,990
one to one relationship and fascinated
by the different ways that orchids

371
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:42,310
package their pollen and then deliver
the pollen through adhering them to

372
00:22:42,311 --> 00:22:46,540
insects. And he discovered that some,
like the one in color here, cat Hasidim,

373
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:51,400
some of them don't simply stick their
pollen to an insect that can forcibly fire

374
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:56,490
their pollen at, at insects. Um, one
of his, his neighbor and protege,

375
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:58,450
John Lubbock, um, in a,

376
00:22:58,451 --> 00:23:03,280
in a memoir that he published in 1874
commented on how Mr Darwin has been so

377
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:05,920
good as to irritate one of
these flowers in my presence.

378
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:10,120
The plenty IOM was thrown nearly three
feet when it struck and adhere to the

379
00:23:10,121 --> 00:23:12,680
pain of a window,
Darwin and his impish way.

380
00:23:12,681 --> 00:23:15,800
It would sometimes take
on friends and family,

381
00:23:15,801 --> 00:23:19,150
sort of who are unaware of showing
them around his greenhouse.

382
00:23:19,151 --> 00:23:21,030
And then he would
surreptitiously trigger a cat,

383
00:23:21,031 --> 00:23:24,950
a see them and get it to fire pollen
at the, at, at his visitors. Um,

384
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,290
there are several accounts of that.
He would also go out to a, uh,

385
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,880
a favorite family picnic
spot near the house.

386
00:23:30,881 --> 00:23:34,180
He called it the family called
it Orkis Bank. Uh, for it's,

387
00:23:34,181 --> 00:23:38,800
it's nice to native orchids and, uh,
at sites like this, he would study,

388
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:43,210
uh, how insects, um, transfer pollen
like this beautiful Burnett and off,

389
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:48,100
you'll notice that the fun, it's coiled
proboscis. How's those yellow, uh,

390
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:51,770
structures? Those are the millennia. Those
are the pollen packets of the orchid.

391
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:55,400
Um, and then the, uh, the drawing
here is from Darwin's orchid book.

392
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:56,930
He's looking at these malls,

393
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,160
unfurling that proboscis and really
interested in demonstrating exactly how

394
00:24:01,161 --> 00:24:05,960
insects, um, lock and key, the sort
of relationships are our fitting,

395
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,150
uh, with, with their orchids. Right.

396
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:13,310
And that's just one little bit
of his adventures in pollination.

397
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:13,940
Um,

398
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:18,830
Darwin spent inordinate amounts of time
studying the ways insects interacted

399
00:24:18,831 --> 00:24:19,670
with flowers.
The,

400
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:23,390
there were accounts of the family
visiting the Zoological Gardens in London

401
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:26,270
while the kids and everyone
else are looking at the animals.

402
00:24:26,271 --> 00:24:30,320
Darwin is crawling in the flower beds
and he's making observations like you see

403
00:24:30,321 --> 00:24:34,910
up here, upper right, this is taken from
the experiment book. He's, he's drawing,

404
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,420
um, the, you know, the ways in which
bees will approach certain flowers.

405
00:24:38,421 --> 00:24:41,390
He's interested in also
trip action mechanisms.

406
00:24:41,391 --> 00:24:45,470
Like you find that Inbar
berries or Mahonia where
they're very touch sensitive,

407
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:49,850
uh, an insect just approaches and touches
the flower slightly. And then the,

408
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:51,290
you know, the, the statements will,

409
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:55,710
will suddenly be triggered and they will
shower the insect with pollen, um, or,

410
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:00,290
or beans, the common bean, which has,
it's a statement and pistols wrapped up.

411
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,820
He calls it like a French horn.

412
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:05,590
When these land on those
down hanging pedals outed,

413
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,790
comes in and dabs pollen
on the back of the B.

414
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:12,260
So he documented meticulously
numerable cases of,

415
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:15,700
of pollination. And he made
an interesting discovery. Um,

416
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,270
it wasn't completely new.

417
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,910
Botanists knew about this but
didn't know what it meant.

418
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,990
And this is the phenomenon known
as Hetero styley and it's a,

419
00:25:23,991 --> 00:25:28,380
it's a case of two or more flower morphs.
Uh,

420
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,050
he first discovered it in primroses, uh,
so-called female morph and a male morph.

421
00:25:33,051 --> 00:25:35,390
So the one on the, on
the, on the left here,

422
00:25:35,391 --> 00:25:39,440
the female morph has a very long
pistol and very short statements.

423
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:44,060
The male morph has the reverse.
It has very long stamens as you see here.

424
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,670
And a very, very short pistol. Well,

425
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:51,440
he was fascinated by this and Darwin and
his characteristic way thinks big and

426
00:25:51,441 --> 00:25:55,250
he's interested in the evolution
of sexes, right? Big Picture.

427
00:25:55,490 --> 00:26:00,320
And he thinks maybe this is an example
of evolution in action that may be the

428
00:26:00,321 --> 00:26:05,321
female morph is eventually becoming
a female only flower evolutionarily.

429
00:26:05,751 --> 00:26:08,390
And the male morphous
becoming a male only flower,

430
00:26:08,391 --> 00:26:10,040
which you do find in some groups.

431
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:14,150
So maybe this is an example of
evolution in action. So he has this,

432
00:26:14,151 --> 00:26:18,700
this hypothesis and what do you do? You
know, the first thing to do is, you know,

433
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:22,520
document, document the frequency.
He Marshall's the troops,

434
00:26:22,521 --> 00:26:26,550
the troops are the kids. So he gets
the kids, you know Horace, who's nine,

435
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:29,840
Lenny Frankie Bessie out they
go. And this is, these are,

436
00:26:29,841 --> 00:26:34,340
this is a page from the experiment
book collecting primroses and he says,

437
00:26:34,341 --> 00:26:37,610
my May 13th,
my children gathered great bunch of cows,

438
00:26:37,611 --> 00:26:41,060
lips 79 stocks where male flowers,
52 were female flowers.

439
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:46,080
And then he would do cross after
cross after cross after cross.

440
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:50,550
These are all from the experiment
book documenting how he would, um,

441
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,550
hand transfer pollen.
And ultimately when,

442
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:57,120
when the seeds form
then count up the seeds.

443
00:26:57,121 --> 00:27:02,121
And his hypothesis hypothesis
is that the female morph,

444
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:05,160
um,
that would perhaps have more seeds,

445
00:27:05,161 --> 00:27:08,670
significantly more seeds produced
than the male morph. Well,

446
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:13,380
interesting hypothesis,
but he butted right up against his friend.

447
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:15,780
Huxley is Great Tragedy Of Science,
right?

448
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:19,020
The slaying of a beautiful
hypothesis by an ugly fact.

449
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:23,340
And the ugly fact in this case was that
he found exactly the opposite of what

450
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:25,860
his working hypothesis suggested.
Right.

451
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:29,730
And indeed that was the male morph that
ended up producing more seeds than the

452
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,550
female morph. Um, so, you know,

453
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,660
nonetheless informative in its own way.
Ultimately he got it right.

454
00:27:36,661 --> 00:27:39,570
He had published a whole separate
book on this subject we're in,

455
00:27:39,571 --> 00:27:41,760
which he argued that
these different morphs,

456
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:46,840
their function evolutionarily is to
enforce out crossing cross fertilization.

457
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:52,520
And it's now been documented in a great
multitude of, of plant groups, um, in,

458
00:27:52,521 --> 00:27:57,020
in my book, um, in that, in that spirit
of, of Darwin's experimental rising,

459
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:57,391
of course,

460
00:27:57,391 --> 00:28:02,391
I have examples of some of the plans
that he explored and instructions on how,

461
00:28:02,731 --> 00:28:07,020
you know, they're different pollination
mechanisms can be explored by, um,

462
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:11,240
you know, experimental
enthusiasts, schoolkids et Cetera.

463
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,830
A couple more examples for you.
Carnivorous plants. So again,

464
00:28:16,831 --> 00:28:17,910
thinking big picture,

465
00:28:17,911 --> 00:28:22,260
Darwin's interested in plant like
animals and animal like plants.

466
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,980
And of course there were two groups
of plants that are, you know,

467
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:27,570
just eminently animal like,

468
00:28:27,571 --> 00:28:32,571
and one is the carnivorous plants and
he's smitten first by Sun dews and his

469
00:28:32,701 --> 00:28:36,480
wife Emma comments, uh, in a
letter to a two to a friend.

470
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:40,200
He hopes in the end to prove it to be
an animal and she's only half kidding.

471
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:43,440
He really does think that, you
know, in such groups who can,

472
00:28:43,441 --> 00:28:46,530
you can see that plant animal,
um,

473
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,900
intersection that they
have common ancestry,

474
00:28:48,901 --> 00:28:52,470
that there are physiological and other
mechanisms that they have in common.

475
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,310
So what does he do?

476
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:57,840
The very first thing he does is begin to
explore their dietary preferences. Um,

477
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:01,500
so he's on holiday in Bournemouth
and first he tries his hair,

478
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:06,720
then he tries his toenails, you know, um,
and of course not very profound results.

479
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,060
Right. You know, clearly
though they don't,

480
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,580
they sort of spit out the hair and
they spit out the toenails. Um, but,

481
00:29:11,581 --> 00:29:16,320
but he embarks upon a year's
long investigation of the
dietary preferences of

482
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:20,940
Sun dews and fly traps and eventually
really does get it right. He understands.

483
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:25,320
He can see the fore runner of digestive
enzymes that were later to be discovered

484
00:29:25,321 --> 00:29:28,950
in animals on pepsin and and such.
Um,

485
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,490
and so I give some examples of how
you can replicate some of Darwin's

486
00:29:32,491 --> 00:29:34,090
experiments trying,
um,

487
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:38,160
different delights that they really
enjoy and some that they don't like very

488
00:29:38,161 --> 00:29:43,060
much and exactly the way Darwin
founded fly traps as well.

489
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,780
Darwin found that, um,
these little tricombs,

490
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:50,020
there's a certain frequency and sequence
for touching these little tricombs on

491
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:54,750
the inner surface of a fly trap
necessary to trip the, the trap. And um,

492
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:55,300
you know,

493
00:29:55,300 --> 00:30:00,300
that's all easily replicated using
a probe or a hair climbing plants.

494
00:30:00,521 --> 00:30:04,600
That's the other group that seems a group
of plants that seems eminently animal

495
00:30:04,601 --> 00:30:05,350
like,

496
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:09,670
and Darwin made an independent discovery
of the principle of circum nutation,

497
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,830
the constant circular probing
movement of climbing plants.

498
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:17,680
It turns out that almost all plants,
they're growing shoots move in that way,

499
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:21,010
but it's highly elaborated and
adaptive and climbing plants.

500
00:30:21,011 --> 00:30:24,760
And tendrils and growing
shoots. So what did he do? Well,

501
00:30:24,761 --> 00:30:28,060
he commandeered the family
terrarium, right? So, so every,

502
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:32,830
every fine home had a miss mailings,
patent, indoor pancakes of course.

503
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:35,650
Um,
and in their parlor they had one of these,

504
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:39,280
but Darwin Room removed all the
ornamental plants, took it over,

505
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,170
put climbing plants in there.

506
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:46,350
And you see in the lower left here how
he used the pop of the glass with tracing

507
00:30:46,601 --> 00:30:50,830
paper with a climbing plant inside a
little markers and reference points so he

508
00:30:50,831 --> 00:30:54,580
can follow the movement of the
very end of the growing tip.

509
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,850
And in that way documented
that circular movement.

510
00:30:57,851 --> 00:31:02,590
And he coined the term circle mutation,
which is still used today. Very,

511
00:31:02,591 --> 00:31:06,070
very interesting. And of course
hops as a great example of a,

512
00:31:06,071 --> 00:31:09,100
of a plant that circle new tastes in a,
in a wonderful way,

513
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:13,000
fairly frequent movement in
that, uh, or fast movement.

514
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:16,840
And so I give instructions on how one
can create a circle of new tolmatter.

515
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,080
I'm either using a clock,
like disc or,

516
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:24,760
or compass coordinates and sort of
document. The way the shoot is, is moving.

517
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:29,860
We'll finally, um, Darwin really
back way back in the 1830s,

518
00:31:29,861 --> 00:31:31,780
was fascinated by earthworms.

519
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:35,380
And this is also the subject
of his very last book.

520
00:31:35,381 --> 00:31:38,410
So this kind of bookends
Darwin's experimental life.

521
00:31:38,411 --> 00:31:42,010
He's fascinated by earthworms
as a geological force.

522
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:47,110
And then also later on he became really
interested in earthworms intelligence

523
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:51,340
and their personality traits and their
preferences, which seems a little,

524
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:55,660
a little funny, but he's very serious
about that. Uh, in one letter to a niece,

525
00:31:55,850 --> 00:32:00,790
he sorta confides how he's becoming
deeply attached to worms is fascinated by

526
00:32:00,791 --> 00:32:05,710
them all through the 1870s. He's
working on them as a geological force.

527
00:32:05,711 --> 00:32:10,390
He believes that earthworms slowly,
surely inexorably rework the landscape,

528
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:15,160
right? They're undermining, they're taking
soil up in the form of their castings,

529
00:32:15,161 --> 00:32:19,150
they're turning over soil and
that way objects slowly sink.

530
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:22,280
And he even collected data
from sites like Stonehenge.

531
00:32:22,281 --> 00:32:27,281
You went out to stone henge great fallen
blocks of stone and was measuring how

532
00:32:27,491 --> 00:32:30,760
deeply it had sunk.
He was looking at Roman ruins,

533
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:33,130
how deeply different artifacts have sunk,

534
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:38,320
and then experimentally trying this by
putting blocks of stone out in fields and

535
00:32:38,321 --> 00:32:43,160
then monitoring years. How's
they slowly subside. In fact,

536
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:47,090
his son, Horace, who later founded the
Cambridge Scientific Instrument Company,

537
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:50,150
I'm really showed his
experimental bent pretty early.

538
00:32:50,151 --> 00:32:55,070
So this is his youngest son and Horace
designed what is known as the worms stone.

539
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:58,070
And this is still in evidence
that down house today,

540
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:03,220
the warm stone is a millstone and Horace
designed a precision micrometer and you

541
00:33:03,801 --> 00:33:06,230
see it here, he actually
published this, the,

542
00:33:06,231 --> 00:33:09,780
the plans for this in nature in 1,901.
Um,

543
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,410
and the idea was that with
a precision micrometer,

544
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,970
the subsidence of the of the millstone
can be very carefully measured, right?

545
00:33:16,971 --> 00:33:20,750
So the action of the worms could
be quantified in that way. Um,

546
00:33:20,751 --> 00:33:23,420
so in that way he quantified
the rate of subsidence,

547
00:33:23,421 --> 00:33:27,200
but the other half of that equation
is the soil brought to the surface.

548
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,380
So with his niece, Lucy, Lucy Wedgewood,

549
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:35,270
he devised quadrats where they would
collect warm castings and then ultimately

550
00:33:35,271 --> 00:33:40,271
quantify how much soil and the form of
worm castings is deposited per unit area.

551
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:44,300
And then extrapolate over
time. This makes it, of course,

552
00:33:44,301 --> 00:33:46,370
until that very last book on Earth Worms,

553
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:50,390
they were able to show that up
to 16 tons of soil per acre,

554
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:55,310
or moved annually by the earthworms,
which is truly, truly remarkable. Right?

555
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:59,540
Um, one other interest though, right?
So worms as a geological force, but,

556
00:33:59,541 --> 00:34:03,260
but also again, there their
intelligence, their predilections.

557
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,270
If you visit Down House today,

558
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,510
this is the parlor as you can visit
it and you might notice something. Um,

559
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:13,220
over here on the back on the piano,
you'll notice a flower pot.

560
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,790
And one might assume
that in fact there are,

561
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:18,530
there should be flowers in the flower pot.
But no,

562
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:20,830
the flower pots were
Darwin's where Murray's,

563
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:25,340
this is where he would
keep his earthworms. And
this recreates one episode,

564
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,640
uh, in the, in the late
1870s where Darwin,

565
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:31,910
his son Francis and his grandson
Bernard and his wife Emma,

566
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:36,590
played musical instruments to the
earthworms. Um, so we have Emma on piano.

567
00:34:36,591 --> 00:34:38,120
She's quite an accomplished pianist.

568
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:41,660
I'm Francis on bassoon and the
little grandson on penny whistle.

569
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,750
And the idea is to sort of see,
you know, what, what is, you know,

570
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:48,800
do they have any musical appreciation?
Can they hear even, you know? Well, um,

571
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,830
well Emma, again, in her
tongue in cheek style,

572
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:56,150
she writes a letter to
Leonard who is away. He says,
father has taken a training.

573
00:34:56,151 --> 00:34:59,690
Earthworms, it doesn't make much progress.
They can neither see nor hear, you know.

574
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:04,370
Um, but nonetheless he was convinced that
they do have the ability to sense the

575
00:35:04,371 --> 00:35:08,820
vibration and by moving the
flower pot off versus on the, the,

576
00:35:08,821 --> 00:35:12,890
the piano. Um, and ultimately
to he devise experiments,

577
00:35:12,891 --> 00:35:17,180
giving them paper cutout so different
shape and size and we document how they

578
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:20,060
feel these shapes and
how they make selections.

579
00:35:20,061 --> 00:35:24,650
They like to align their burrows with,
um, with these things. And so you can see,

580
00:35:24,651 --> 00:35:28,010
for example, in this reconstruction
that quite a few of these,

581
00:35:28,011 --> 00:35:31,190
a bits of cabbage and paper
cutouts have disappeared.

582
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:32,420
And you can kind of test their,

583
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,710
their preferences for different shapes
and sizes of these paper cutoffs. Exactly.

584
00:35:36,711 --> 00:35:41,700
The Way Darwin did well on
that is really just, you know,

585
00:35:41,701 --> 00:35:45,640
the, the mirror asked introduction to
though the weird and wonderful world of

586
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,220
Darwin's experiment type
thing. Um, again, I,

587
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:51,910
I really do appreciate this opportunity
to, to share this with you. Um,

588
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,850
thanks so much for your attention to that.

589
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,450
And of course,
thank you.

590
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,550
And of course very happy to answer
any questions that you might have.

591
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,333
Yes,

592
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,880
thank you so much for the talk.
It was quite interesting.

593
00:36:07,881 --> 00:36:12,830
I didn't know any thing about Darwin,
the man versus his science.

594
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:13,910
Um,

595
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:18,910
one thing I'm wondering is obviously
Darwin was special in his time because he

596
00:36:19,311 --> 00:36:24,311
made a lot of discoveries and theories
that turned out to be true that others

597
00:36:24,981 --> 00:36:29,210
did not make. So why was
he special? I mean, what,

598
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:33,470
what was it in his upbringing or in this
person or something that made him do

599
00:36:33,471 --> 00:36:34,430
those things?
Do you know?

600
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:38,870
That's a good question. I mean,
of course he blundered a lot too.

601
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:43,730
There were a lot of, um, false
starts and dead ends as well. Um,

602
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:47,960
he Darwin himself
reflected on, on his, um,

603
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:52,160
insights on his successes and,
and he really thought that a,

604
00:36:52,161 --> 00:36:55,940
that a certain persistence,
uh, was a lot of it. So He,

605
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:58,930
if he special, it may be that, um,

606
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,740
he really had a sticktuitiveness he
would have an idea and really pursue that

607
00:37:03,741 --> 00:37:07,700
idea. I mean, just to the nth degree.
He would, he would pursue ideas.

608
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:12,230
Sometimes they just did not pan out.
You know, he just blew it completely.

609
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:15,770
But other times they ended up
yielding incredible insights.

610
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:18,350
And from a modern perspective,
it's really interesting,

611
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:23,440
especially for historians of science how
many fundamental scientific principles

612
00:37:23,511 --> 00:37:27,590
and ecology and evolution have their
basis in these very simple backyard

613
00:37:27,591 --> 00:37:31,550
experiments. But I think that a lot
of it is really the persistence.

614
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:36,650
Of course he had the advantage to,
this is with hindsight, right? But,

615
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,570
um,
he's one of the very few,

616
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:42,470
maybe apart from only from the
great Alfred Russell Wallace,

617
00:37:42,471 --> 00:37:46,190
his colleague who independently discovered
the principle of natural selection.

618
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:50,120
He had this evolutionary view of things,

619
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:53,000
relationships in organisms,
uh, hit the history,

620
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:57,290
evolutionary history of organisms
down the mechanism behind it,

621
00:37:57,350 --> 00:38:01,640
natural selection with that knowledge,
the benefit of that knowledge,

622
00:38:01,641 --> 00:38:06,550
that guided many questions. Now the fact
that he got so much right, right when he,

623
00:38:06,551 --> 00:38:10,190
he, he almost alone except
for Wallace had this vision.

624
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,430
And so he's really the only
one asking such questions.

625
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:17,120
So that also accounts for a lot of his
success of you're about the only one

626
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,650
investigating an area.

627
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,550
You're bound to be making a lot of the
first discoveries in, in that area.

628
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:26,410
Um, you mentioned a couple of his
partners that he worked closely with in

629
00:38:26,411 --> 00:38:28,660
corresponded with and of course
he had partner with his kids,

630
00:38:28,661 --> 00:38:30,880
it sounds like on some of these
experiments, but was there,

631
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,450
was there a larger network of
scientists that he was a part of,

632
00:38:34,451 --> 00:38:36,010
sort of beyond call for,
you

633
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,550
know, crowd sourcing, um,

634
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:40,870
on a regular basis who
are sort of interested in
engaged in the same pursuits?

635
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:44,980
Yeah, that's a, that's a good
question. And I'm so, yeah,

636
00:38:44,981 --> 00:38:48,220
despite the fact that Darwin became
quite a homebody, you know, he,

637
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:51,700
he rarely traveled except maybe
to some holiday destinations.

638
00:38:51,701 --> 00:38:54,970
Maybe he went as far as Scotland
after his famous beagle voyage,

639
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:59,170
but really very much stayed
at home. And yet, you know,

640
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:01,510
quite a few scientific
visitors came to him.

641
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,780
And his correspondence is about
humanists, right? I mean, um,

642
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,780
tens of thousands of letters.

643
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:12,700
So he is very much a part of a scientific
network that is global. And of course,

644
00:39:12,701 --> 00:39:17,440
once he achieves a certain level of fame,
people are very happy to send in data,

645
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:22,420
share information, and send specimens.
In addition right there in London,

646
00:39:22,421 --> 00:39:27,340
London scientific society. He benefits
from his buddies. You know, Joseph Hooker,

647
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:31,740
uh, the botanist, you know,
one of the leading botanists
have his day in the UK. Uh,

648
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:34,810
certainly, um, is the
director of Kew Gardens.

649
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:39,610
And Q is perhaps at that time, you
know, the greatest center of, you know,

650
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:42,760
global center of living plants
and from around the world.

651
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:47,740
So Darwin is able to do
a lot of experimenting on
plants that hooker would very

652
00:39:47,741 --> 00:39:49,420
kindly just Lendon,
you know,

653
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:53,650
so here you have the greatest national
collection at your fingertips, you know,

654
00:39:53,651 --> 00:39:56,800
fabulous. And for quite a
few other, um, you know,

655
00:39:56,801 --> 00:40:01,090
London was very much the center of,
of British scientific society.

656
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,310
And um,
he was never very far away.

657
00:40:03,311 --> 00:40:07,690
He would sometimes go into the scientific
societies to meetings, reading papers,

658
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:11,000
but just as often they would
come to him. And so, um,

659
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:14,370
I think it's fair to say that
he was very much globally, uh,

660
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:18,640
certainly nationally and also globally
connected even though he rarely left home

661
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,530
all over. This is all a part of
course from the crowd sourcing.

662
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:27,670
Yeah, I was, I was thinking of a question
before you've sort of got into that,

663
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,520
about that idea of,
um,

664
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:36,210
geographically w what do you think were
the advantages besides this proximity to

665
00:40:36,221 --> 00:40:39,490
London, of Darwin doing his
studies where he did them?

666
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:43,270
Do you think that there's
something about the ecology of, uh,

667
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,630
the sort of British isles that gave
him an advantage? Or do you think it,

668
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:49,140
it really was more just,
um,

669
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:52,120
being able to tap into that
global network that sort of,

670
00:40:52,121 --> 00:40:54,700
the British empire had at the time?

671
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:58,960
That's a good question too. I
would say no, there's nothing.

672
00:40:58,961 --> 00:41:03,010
I don't think that there's anything
really special about the place. In fact,

673
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:06,980
in some ways it's actually not a very
good place to conduct certain types of,

674
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:08,610
of experiments.
Um,

675
00:41:08,611 --> 00:41:11,740
there are certain groups of organisms
that are very low in diversity,

676
00:41:11,741 --> 00:41:14,920
for example. Um, I think
it more has to do with,

677
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,020
first of all these types of experiments,

678
00:41:17,021 --> 00:41:21,220
they really can be conducted almost
anywhere, right? So there is that,

679
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:25,990
but beyond that, nothing in my opinion,
very special about that geography,

680
00:41:25,991 --> 00:41:30,700
you know, immediately there. So
therefore benefiting more from,

681
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:35,690
um, from his, uh, his
place in society, you know,

682
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:38,150
proximity to London. Um, his,

683
00:41:38,151 --> 00:41:42,680
his good friends who were really
leaders of British science at that time.

684
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:47,840
And then his ability through his own fame
and accomplishments, um, to, to attract,

685
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:51,530
uh, the, the, the support
of people around the world.

686
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:55,880
He had good friends here in the u
s um, he had, um, a global network.

687
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:59,780
I think that was more important than the,
than the particular geography.

688
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:03,980
The geography turns out to
be a tremendously interesting
and important, but, uh,

689
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:07,090
but I don't think that it
itself set the stage for the,

690
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:11,540
some interesting experiments necessarily.
Maybe with one exception.

691
00:42:11,541 --> 00:42:16,280
And that would be earthworms
in any glacial landscape
dry. So not so here. Right.

692
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:21,230
In northern North America
glaciated landscape, um,
earthworms were extra Paden.

693
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,600
Right, so you're knocking, you don't have
nearly the same, you know, there were,

694
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:26,360
there are exotic worms introduced here,

695
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:31,360
but the native fauna was expert paid
it in the last glacial maximum. Um,

696
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:35,240
so that did not happen, you know,
um, where Darwin lived and so,

697
00:42:35,241 --> 00:42:38,240
so maybe at least the earthworms
dependent on that geography. Yeah.

698
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,970
Yeah. Thanks for speaking. Um,

699
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:49,320
my question for you is why is Darwin
such a popular figure in even modern era?

700
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:54,860
Like there's a lot of sciences that did
a lot of amazing work such as Mendel

701
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:58,520
Hooker and we don't really know
their name off the top of our heads,

702
00:42:58,550 --> 00:42:59,480
whereas Darwin,

703
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:02,690
even though he seems like he's very much
of a homebody and he's not like a fun,

704
00:43:02,691 --> 00:43:06,740
quirky kind of guy, um, everybody
knows who he is even today.

705
00:43:06,741 --> 00:43:11,600
So what is it about either the volume of
the work he created or the type of work

706
00:43:11,601 --> 00:43:15,200
created that made him so well known?
Far and wide?

707
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:19,020
Yeah. Now that's a, that's a very
good question as well. I mean, I,

708
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:23,840
I think that it has much to do with um,
the very subject itself.

709
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:26,540
You know, Darwin becoming
associated, you know,

710
00:43:26,541 --> 00:43:30,800
just inevitably with this idea of
evolution by natural selection.

711
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:35,450
And no, as I showed here after
the origin book after book,

712
00:43:35,451 --> 00:43:39,140
I mean he really is reinforcing
and extending. So I mean he,

713
00:43:39,141 --> 00:43:44,141
he truly saw the implications for this
idea and he sought it out in all of these

714
00:43:44,691 --> 00:43:45,860
areas. So, you know,

715
00:43:45,861 --> 00:43:50,330
he used to be maybe commended for really
solidifying and extending a body of

716
00:43:50,331 --> 00:43:55,280
knowledge or a certain way
of understanding the world.
Um, but at the same time,

717
00:43:55,550 --> 00:44:00,170
I think you all recognize that, um, in
some parts of the world, you know, uh,

718
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:04,010
including in our country,
right? The, the idea, um,

719
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:09,490
is polarizing and Darwin also became the
kind of therefore poster child for an

720
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:15,330
as sort of a, it's a, it's a caricature
really. But this idea that, um, that,

721
00:44:15,331 --> 00:44:19,730
that the scientific ideas must
therefore be opposed to, um, to,

722
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:21,860
to religion and society.
Um,

723
00:44:21,861 --> 00:44:25,640
some of some elements of that we're seeing
in British society and the late 19th

724
00:44:25,641 --> 00:44:27,150
century.
Um,

725
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:31,190
and it'd be really became rekindled
and intensified and the 20th,

726
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:32,760
especially in the US,

727
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:37,880
I think that he represents that
idea that some people find, um,

728
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:41,910
deeply distressing, disturbing,
blasphemous, whatever,
however you want to put it.

729
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:45,930
As far as the, as the sort of poster
child almost for this idea, uh,

730
00:44:45,931 --> 00:44:49,360
he then becomes iconic. And, um, and I,

731
00:44:49,361 --> 00:44:51,960
I think that that's a
lot of it as well then.

732
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:55,550
And as is as true in the history
of science generally. Um,

733
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:59,370
it's unfortunate but true that there
are just a select few individuals I,

734
00:44:59,371 --> 00:45:00,930
for whatever quirky reason,

735
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:05,070
end up becoming household
names and representing whole,

736
00:45:05,071 --> 00:45:10,010
vast disciplines that actually have
armies of very talented investigators beat

737
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:14,880
behind them. Um, and those investigators
are unsung typically outside the field,

738
00:45:14,881 --> 00:45:19,230
perhaps, and a and unknown. And
certainly with Darwin, it's,

739
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:23,900
it's all on a whole different scale
because of the societal implications of,

740
00:45:23,901 --> 00:45:26,340
of these ideas,
I believe.

741
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:28,670
Thank you.
Everybody.
