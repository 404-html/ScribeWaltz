1
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,660
And I would like to introduce today,
Dan Valana manner.

2
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,710
He is a computational neuroscientist from
Ucla and today today he'll talk about

3
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:17,620
his book.
Your brain is a time machine,

4
00:00:17,621 --> 00:00:21,310
which you can actually buy a
discounted price at this table.

5
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,650
And so that was for those
of you that comes in.

6
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,580
Thank you and thank you for all for
coming today. It's a pleasure to be here.

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,200
So I'd like to talk a bit about time and
the brain and the brain and the nature

8
00:00:40,431 --> 00:00:43,130
of time.
And to get my talk started,

9
00:00:43,131 --> 00:00:45,590
I'd like to start by creating a

10
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:52,930
awkward silence. Um, and I'd like
to do that to make three points.

11
00:00:52,931 --> 00:00:56,920
The first is that your
brain is automatically
attempting to predict what is

12
00:00:56,921 --> 00:00:59,410
about to happen.
Your brain as a prediction machine.

13
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,200
So right there you are trying to
predict what's was about to happen.

14
00:01:02,201 --> 00:01:06,580
Maybe you're thinking, oh, he's having
an absence seizure. Um, number two,

15
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,770
your brain is automatically telling time.

16
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,510
The only reason you could notice that
pause is because you're creating a

17
00:01:13,511 --> 00:01:18,511
temporal expectation of the normal
average pause between words and that bio,

18
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:21,160
that temporal pause was violated.

19
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:26,080
And that's when the passage of time came
to your attention and that's my point

20
00:01:26,081 --> 00:01:26,860
number three,

21
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:31,860
you probably became aware of the passage
of time you the subjective feeling of

22
00:01:32,771 --> 00:01:37,771
time going slowly because
it was a slightly awkward
moment and I'm time probably

23
00:01:37,841 --> 00:01:41,890
seemed to be going
slowly and hopefully um,

24
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,500
it wasn't as long as it seemed to be,

25
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,350
at least I hope it wasn't because
to me it seemed like a full minute.

26
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:52,990
But before we delve in to the mechanisms
of how the brain tells time in the

27
00:01:52,991 --> 00:01:54,460
meaning of the nature of time,

28
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:58,720
let me for already start off by pointing
out that I've used the word time a

29
00:01:58,721 --> 00:02:03,720
number of times in this talk already and
I assume you know what I mean and I s

30
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:08,140
and you assume I know what the word
means, but isn't that the case? Do we,

31
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:12,310
can we actually define time?
It turns out, I'm sorry, here,

32
00:02:12,311 --> 00:02:14,140
let me get used to clicking this.

33
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:19,500
It turns out that the word time is the
most common noun in the English language

34
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,460
along with two others that are
units of time, year and day.

35
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:29,530
So on. This is an obvious indication
of how important time is in our lives.

36
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,400
Um,

37
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,840
but it's a bit ironic that the most
common noun in the English language is one

38
00:02:34,841 --> 00:02:39,130
that we really can't define. It's been
embarrassing action, isn't it? Um,

39
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:42,400
so this brings us to the problem.
How do we define time?

40
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:47,740
And people have struggled with
this for a long, long time. So,

41
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:51,700
um, a thousand, 600 years
ago, Saint Augustine said,

42
00:02:51,701 --> 00:02:54,040
what then is time if no one asks me,
I know what it is.

43
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:58,570
If I wish to explain it to me,
what you asks, I do not know. Um,

44
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:04,720
a thousand, 600 years later, the
great physicist Richard Fineman,

45
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:09,130
who's not wanting to give up easily on
problems, basically gave up and said,

46
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,800
maybe it's just as well we faced the
fact that time is one of those things we

47
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:15,400
probably cannot define what matters
anyways is not how we defined time,

48
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,790
but how we measure it.
Um,

49
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,990
but it was probably the author Douglas
Adams that gave us the most important

50
00:03:22,991 --> 00:03:26,770
definition of time. Time is an
illusion. Lunchtime. Doubly so.

51
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:28,893
Um,

52
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:33,970
so part of the problem is that the word
time really means different things.

53
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:37,330
Right? And let me give you this rather
contrive sentence to make that point.

54
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,570
Einstein's talk on the nature of time,
um,

55
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:45,370
started on time but seem to
last a long time. Um, okay.

56
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:47,590
So first the nature of time,

57
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:52,620
so that refers to the physics of time
is time a full blown dimension as in um,

58
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:58,180
the four dimensions of time is only
the present, uh, exist is time.

59
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:03,160
A abstraction that we scientist used
to help us understand the universe.

60
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,220
Second started on time.
That's clock time.

61
00:04:06,221 --> 00:04:08,950
That's the easiest time to define right.
That's um,

62
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:12,670
time is defined as what clocks town
as circular as that definition is.

63
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,660
It's a really useful one and probably
the most important in that it got all of

64
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:21,310
us here on time. Um, the last one
is the subjective feeling of time.

65
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,850
So it seemed to last a long time and um,

66
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,540
that's tightly linked law on linked
to the problem of consciousness.

67
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,830
So in that sense,

68
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:35,010
the subjective sense of time is also
a very difficult problem to address.

69
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,580
Now starting with the first question,
um,

70
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,340
the brain is,
um,

71
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,280
time is really important
to how the brain works. So,

72
00:04:45,281 --> 00:04:48,700
and this is why I consider in many
ways the brain to be, if you will,

73
00:04:48,701 --> 00:04:51,070
a time machine.
And there's four reasons for that.

74
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,020
The brain is a machine that tells time,

75
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:57,130
the brain generates the subjective
feeling of the passage of time,

76
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,740
the brain attempts to predict the future.

77
00:04:59,741 --> 00:05:04,741
The brain is a remembers the past
in order to predict the future.

78
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:09,250
And finally the brain allows us
to project ourselves mentally,

79
00:05:09,251 --> 00:05:12,400
mentally project ourselves into the pastor
of the future is something we called

80
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,460
mental time travel. And this
is really important for, um,

81
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:22,140
our ability to interact with the world
in terms of what's makes humans unique is

82
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:26,170
our ability to engage
in mental time travel.

83
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:29,740
And we'll talk a bit more about this,
but first, consider the first issue here.

84
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,360
The brain is a time machine.

85
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:36,570
So the brain tells time across 12 orders
of magnitude from microseconds at the

86
00:05:37,451 --> 00:05:41,140
lower end over there too. Um, down here,

87
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:43,960
which you're using right now
to four sound localization.

88
00:05:43,961 --> 00:05:48,961
So your brain picks up
the tens or hundreds of
microseconds delays it takes to

89
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,170
sound to arrive from my left ear to my
writing by picking up the Delta t's,

90
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,620
the relative time, delays their
time, perception in speech,

91
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,570
um, eyes on the order of hundreds
of milliseconds and seconds. Music,

92
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:06,770
motor coordination is happening
on this range of time perception.

93
00:06:06,771 --> 00:06:11,660
And we'll delve more into that and
then we have time estimation, um,

94
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:14,630
which is sort of what most people think
of when we talk about their sense of

95
00:06:14,631 --> 00:06:19,530
time. How long has, um, how
long has this talk been lasting?

96
00:06:19,531 --> 00:06:23,040
How long has the light red light
been waiting to change and so forth.

97
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:23,731
And find the,

98
00:06:23,731 --> 00:06:26,730
you have your circadian rhythms and that
everybody's familiar with in terms of

99
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:31,740
controlling your clock, when to get out
in the morning and went to go to bed now.

100
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,890
So how does the brain tell time?
So to answer that question,

101
00:06:34,891 --> 00:06:39,630
it's useful to think about timing
and these different scales. So,

102
00:06:39,631 --> 00:06:41,730
for example,
in language,

103
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:46,760
a couple of examples here are if I say
something like they gave her cat food or

104
00:06:47,341 --> 00:06:52,230
they gave her cat food, right? So there
you're using the pause and speech, um,

105
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:57,060
to determine this, the content of the
meaning of the sentence. And by the way,

106
00:06:57,061 --> 00:07:00,930
this is something that artificial
speech, um, systems, um,

107
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,280
still struggle with a bit.

108
00:07:02,281 --> 00:07:06,590
This is one of the challenges and it's
because of some of the mistakes that I'm,

109
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,670
there's still made even with
the most advanced systems.

110
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,810
Now another example here is in music.

111
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:18,740
And now I'm going to play
to you a piece of music.

112
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:24,150
And the task here is it's a hybrid piece
of music and see if it reminds you of

113
00:07:24,151 --> 00:07:25,950
anything.
But the time has been altered.

114
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:28,710
And I know some of you are here at the
beginning and you probably saw the next

115
00:07:28,711 --> 00:07:31,560
slide here. So you're going to
have to keep quiet. But, um,

116
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,330
Google please play music here.

117
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,940
So does this remind you of any
piece of music you know of?

118
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,670
So I'll give you a hint.
You guys are young crowd,

119
00:07:52,671 --> 00:07:57,490
but it's from a group called the
Beatles. Um, does it remind anybody?

120
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:01,440
Does that ring a bell to anybody? Can
anybody pick up what that was? Yup.

121
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:07,220
Okay. Very good. Anything else? Anybody
else pick the reminder? Any other song?

122
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,310
So that's a hybrid song there.

123
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:13,880
So what that was was the notes.

124
00:08:13,881 --> 00:08:18,710
So you're paying more attention to the
notes. The melody of I'm yellow submarine,

125
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,390
but it was the timing of yesterday.

126
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:25,580
So we sort of did a hybrid crossing of
the spatial information and the temporal

127
00:08:25,581 --> 00:08:29,300
information. So sometimes people pick
up a bit more on the temporal structure.

128
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:31,310
Sometimes people pick
up more on the melody.

129
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,870
But this is just to make the obvious
point that without time and ability to

130
00:08:35,871 --> 00:08:39,350
perceive and to tell time,
um,

131
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,940
music of course wouldn't exist.

132
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:45,970
And indeed it's in this scale of tens
to hundreds of milliseconds that time.

133
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,020
Is that, um, most important.

134
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:53,270
So in the context of the lab,
for example,

135
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,700
one question we ask is whatever mechanisms
are they in your brain that allow you

136
00:08:56,701 --> 00:09:00,240
to tell time, can they
improve with practice? Um,

137
00:09:00,241 --> 00:09:05,241
so we often ask in studies where we do
an interval discrimination studies to

138
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,130
tell us what is the first or second
interval, the longest Google,

139
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,090
please play music.

140
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,430
So there's a simple intervals,
discrimination task. And the question is,

141
00:09:15,431 --> 00:09:16,810
was the first or second longest?

142
00:09:16,811 --> 00:09:19,810
And the first was a hundred milliseconds
and the second interval was 150

143
00:09:19,811 --> 00:09:20,644
milliseconds.

144
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:25,810
Now if you have some timer in your
brain that's fixed like a watch,

145
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,360
maybe it doesn't matter,
maybe you can't get better at that.

146
00:09:28,361 --> 00:09:31,660
But if you practice and
that timer improves,

147
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:34,450
then you should be able to pick that up.
And we do,

148
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:39,810
and we can tell here that
in the 100 millisecond case,

149
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:44,170
that's what you just heard. People
improved dramatically with practice.

150
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,820
But interestingly, if you had a clock in
your brain that was your master clock,

151
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,520
you'd also get in that
clock was somehow improving.

152
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,590
You should get better at all intervals.

153
00:09:53,591 --> 00:09:56,820
So you should also get better
at 50 millisecond interval
of the 200 millisecond

154
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:01,330
interval or the 500 millisecond. But you
don't. So this is a bit strange, right?

155
00:10:01,331 --> 00:10:03,760
It's almost as if you have
multiple clocks in your brain,

156
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:09,060
you have an array of different clocks
that can tell time across different time

157
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:12,730
ranges.
So how does the brain do that?

158
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,250
Or where in the brain does the brain,
um,

159
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,790
what parts of the brain responsible
for timing. Fortunately,

160
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:22,840
we know exactly what part of the brain
tells time and that's this part right

161
00:10:22,841 --> 00:10:27,470
here, right beside locality and
music conveniently located. Um,

162
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:31,200
this of course is nonsense.
Um, but this friend,

163
00:10:31,201 --> 00:10:34,030
a logical view of time never lasts,

164
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,980
is surprisingly influential, um,
in how people think about times.

165
00:10:37,981 --> 00:10:39,550
So people do still think about time,

166
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,670
even today in the sense that you might
have a central clock in your brain.

167
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:46,000
So the office of this faculty is to
mark the passage of time, duration,

168
00:10:46,001 --> 00:10:48,790
succession of events, et Cetera.
It ultra remembers dates,

169
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:53,320
keeps correct time and music and dancing
and induces to punctuality in the

170
00:10:53,321 --> 00:10:54,640
fulfillment of engagement.

171
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,840
So this is an extreme view of what you'd
call a central clock or a master clock

172
00:10:58,841 --> 00:11:01,090
in your brain.
We know that this is not correct.

173
00:11:01,091 --> 00:11:02,980
The brain has multiple ways to tell.

174
00:11:02,981 --> 00:11:07,981
Time is multiple areas in the brain
that are involved in telling time.

175
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,560
So understand how the brain tells time.

176
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:16,590
Let's first remind ourselves how
man made clocks actually work.

177
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,840
So manmade clocks,
um,

178
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,560
despite their complexity all work for
the most part under an embarrassingly

179
00:11:26,171 --> 00:11:29,650
simple principle.
And that's just an Oscillator,

180
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,750
your time base and a counter.

181
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,380
So whether you're talking about a
pendulum clock or a quartz crystal,

182
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:40,560
or even an atomic clock in which you're
using the period of the electromagnetic

183
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:43,720
vibrations, um, to tell time,

184
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:48,250
you're just counting the ticks of an
oscillator. So it's reasonable to ask,

185
00:11:48,251 --> 00:11:51,430
is that how the brain tells time?
The answer is no.

186
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,940
So as quote from Einstein reminds us,

187
00:11:54,941 --> 00:11:58,390
any physical phenomenon may be used
as a clock provided it can be exactly

188
00:11:58,391 --> 00:12:00,820
repeated as many times as desired.

189
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:06,220
So here we have raindrops
falling on a pond.

190
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:09,400
And if I asked you which
raindrop fell first,

191
00:12:09,401 --> 00:12:12,550
the up one over here or down here,

192
00:12:12,551 --> 00:12:14,530
you could tell me this
raindrop fell first.

193
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:17,470
And if we were so inclined
and knew a bit of physics,

194
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:18,910
we could even calculate the interval.

195
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:24,240
So the point is is that even this
static image has information about time.

196
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:29,110
And that's because physical systems
that have dynamics naturally tell time.

197
00:12:29,111 --> 00:12:32,320
I mean that's essentially what dynamics
is. Dynamics is the change in time.

198
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,800
So the idea is is that the brain uses
its own dynamics as one way to tell time.

199
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:39,820
So neurons

200
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:46,540
are the computation element of the brain.
And neurons have their axons,

201
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:49,540
they have, I'm sorry, they have their
dendrites and the axons down here,

202
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:54,490
the axons of one neuron can come over
and synapse on the dendrites of another

203
00:12:54,491 --> 00:12:57,130
neuron.
And that's where they make a synapse.

204
00:12:57,131 --> 00:13:01,990
It releases transmitter here and creates
a bioelectrical signal that travels

205
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,420
towards the Soma of the
postsynaptic neuron.

206
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:08,470
So if you have these elements and
they're connected to each other,

207
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,680
one way we could make a time or clock,
if you will,

208
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,370
is to connect them in a chain.

209
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,520
So if we had one neuron that was connected
to another, connected to another,

210
00:13:18,521 --> 00:13:20,080
connected to another,
connected to another,

211
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:25,120
we can now see that we'll have this
temporal pattern of activity in which one

212
00:13:25,121 --> 00:13:27,670
neurons activates the next, activates
the next, next, I mean it's the next.

213
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:32,350
So you know that if this neuron is active,
that eight or nine,

214
00:13:32,351 --> 00:13:34,870
10 units, um, time units have elapsed.

215
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:40,380
So indeed it seems that one way the
brain tells time on the scale of tens to

216
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,180
hundreds of milliseconds to
seconds is through neural dynamics.

217
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:50,550
Um, and we know this in
part due to research, um,

218
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,680
on a number of studies on both humans
and animals and one animal that knows how

219
00:13:56,561 --> 00:14:01,450
to time very well our songbirds. So these
are zebra finches and um, they sing,

220
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:04,150
and I won't play you their song here,

221
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,210
but this is the spectrogram
of a zebra finch song.

222
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:12,660
And I'm not too different from speech
in which this is our frequency access.

223
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:16,390
This is of course time and these
are the syllables of the song.

224
00:14:16,391 --> 00:14:20,590
And they can sing this hundreds and
hundreds of time pretty faithfully,

225
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:23,590
where you could almost overlay
each song on top of each other.

226
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:29,410
When scientists record from neurons
in an area of the Zebra finch brain,

227
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:32,860
um, they can record from
many different neurons.

228
00:14:32,861 --> 00:14:35,440
So here the recording from 136 neurons,

229
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:39,190
and here we're just showing the activity
when those neurons spike and aligning

230
00:14:39,191 --> 00:14:41,860
them in time.
And so some neurons spike early on,

231
00:14:41,861 --> 00:14:43,720
some neurons spike later and so forth.

232
00:14:43,721 --> 00:14:47,800
So you have sort of this chain of
activity in which seems to be the brain's

233
00:14:47,801 --> 00:14:49,540
clock for the song at least.

234
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:52,460
So some neurons telling it's
the beginning of the song,

235
00:14:52,461 --> 00:14:55,290
middle of the song and so forth.
So you have these complex patterns,

236
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:59,600
neural dynamics.
Now in a more complex network,

237
00:14:59,601 --> 00:15:04,130
and this is a simulation here. Um, and
normally I wouldn't show the simulation,

238
00:15:04,131 --> 00:15:08,270
but here because I'm at Google and
there's a strong interest in on AI and

239
00:15:08,271 --> 00:15:09,104
machine learning.

240
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:14,290
I'll give you an example of a simulation
of a recurrent neural network in which,

241
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:22,280
um, you're simulating neurons and these
neurons are connected to each other.

242
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:26,480
And, um, actually curl,
I'm going to act, I forgot.

243
00:15:26,481 --> 00:15:29,600
There's one more s button I'm going to
have to ask Google depressed in a minute.

244
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,720
Um, so, um, and when you do this,
this network is going to do um,

245
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:38,210
a speech recognition task,
a speech transcription task.

246
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:43,510
So the network will listen to a spoken
degette and then transcribe that pattern

247
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:48,410
in time. So can Google, can you
still start that movie please?

248
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:54,600
So what you'll see here,
I'll show point over here.

249
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:58,680
So that's the spectrogram and this is
the activity in the neural network.

250
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:02,760
So this is the activity of different
neurons and this is driving that activity.

251
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,520
And that activity here is driving.
So there's not much hidden here.

252
00:16:08,521 --> 00:16:12,180
Unlike say a deep learning network, which
drives a lot of series power. Of course,

253
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,700
this is the whole thing
happening right here.

254
00:16:14,701 --> 00:16:17,610
This network is driving this
and processing this stimulus.

255
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,670
There's around 4,000 units in this.
So in contrast,

256
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:24,350
a deep network in which
you have millions. So, um,

257
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,480
that was an fast eight in
the next eight will be slower

258
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:29,523
a.

259
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,170
So that was a slower eight.

260
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:37,200
And the point here is that by encoding
time in these trajectories in the

261
00:16:37,601 --> 00:16:39,400
dynamics of these neural networks,

262
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:43,570
it naturally solves the problem of
what we call temporal and variants.

263
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:47,230
The issue of how you can
recognize a song or speech,

264
00:16:47,231 --> 00:16:50,560
whether it's spoken very
quickly or very slowly.

265
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,430
So overall,
as far as we know,

266
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:58,570
one of the major computational strategies,

267
00:16:58,571 --> 00:17:02,140
the brain has to process
time varying information,

268
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:05,740
which is most of the information you'd
passing right now. Speech of course,

269
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:08,320
is through neural dynamics,

270
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:13,270
sister changing patterns of activity.
Now

271
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:19,630
we all know that whatever the clocks
that are within our brain is sometimes

272
00:17:19,631 --> 00:17:20,980
they're accurate,
inaccurate.

273
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:24,970
So there's a mismatch between
objective time and subjective time.

274
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:27,090
And um,

275
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:31,600
this leads to temporal illusions or
temporal distortions everybody's familiar

276
00:17:31,601 --> 00:17:33,640
with, with, um, time flies
when you're having fun.

277
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:38,250
And to go back to a quote from
Henry James, which was, um,

278
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:42,940
from his magnum opus principles of
psychology or in over a hundred years ago,

279
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,320
he says in general,

280
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,730
a time filled with varied and interesting
experiences seems shore in passing,

281
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,170
but long as we look back, on
the other hand, attractive time,

282
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,070
empty of experiences seems long in
passing. But in retrospect, short,

283
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:00,220
so some people refer to this as
the vacation paradox. You're,

284
00:18:00,221 --> 00:18:05,040
you're having fun in eighth and in
Athens for the first day and um,

285
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,930
you're seeing a lot of new sites,

286
00:18:06,931 --> 00:18:10,680
meeting New People and time
seems to fly by prospectively.

287
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:16,110
So as it's happening,
as it's playing out prospectively,

288
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,570
um,
your estimates of time are on the,

289
00:18:19,571 --> 00:18:23,100
a short amount of time has elapsed even
though it might have been a long period

290
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:27,360
of time. But retrospectively,
as you look back,

291
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:31,470
that's not so much a timing task,
but a memory task.

292
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,740
You're thinking of back of the number
of items or you're influenced by the

293
00:18:34,741 --> 00:18:38,810
number of items in memory. So if you
have it filled day in which a lot of, um,

294
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,170
interesting things were happening,

295
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,980
you're going to have a lot of memories
of that event and left with the

296
00:18:43,981 --> 00:18:47,940
impression that it was a long period
of time. Elapsing now in contrast,

297
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:53,380
if you're bored or anxious, then, um,

298
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:57,480
as time is going by prospectively,
um,

299
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:01,290
you might overestimate the amount of time
it seems like a lot of time has been,

300
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:05,230
I'm going by,
so you're stuck at the airport and um,

301
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,280
you're on a six hour wait because of
a plane delay and time is dragging,

302
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:12,541
right?

303
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:17,541
You're bored out of your
mind retrospectively when
you look back upon your trip,

304
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:23,460
that's merely merely a blip
in your conscious experiences.
Right? So because, um,

305
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:27,510
you know, the Atlanta bathroom is
only so interesting and it didn't, um,

306
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:31,900
store too much information about
that wonderful experience, um,

307
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:35,280
in your memory banks.
So you have,

308
00:19:35,281 --> 00:19:39,780
we have this paradox between prospective
timing in retrospect of timing, which,

309
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:44,310
um, in part influences our
ability to tell time. Now,

310
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:50,210
everybody has also known about cases
under sort of extreme danger or um,

311
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,580
extreme stress situations in which people
report time actually slowing down or

312
00:19:56,581 --> 00:20:00,450
things happening in slow motion.
And um,

313
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,200
so this is a report of a
race car driver who, um,

314
00:20:04,201 --> 00:20:07,200
was whose car was thrown into air,
spun around in the air.

315
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,460
He obviously survived and um,
later gives this report.

316
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:13,320
It seemed like the whole
thing took forever.

317
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,550
Everything was in slow motion
and it seemed to me like
I was a player on a stage

318
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:20,130
and could see myself tumbling
over and over in the car.

319
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:23,190
It was as though I sat in the
stands and saw it all happening.

320
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:28,680
So here obviously it's not only their
impression of the passage of time that is

321
00:20:28,681 --> 00:20:30,390
being altered right space as well.

322
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:33,690
I think this is probably best
described as an hallucination.

323
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,250
So this is an altered state,
um,

324
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:41,570
in which our sense of time and sense
of body sense of space has been

325
00:20:42,181 --> 00:20:44,370
dramatically altered.
So I think this,

326
00:20:44,371 --> 00:20:47,950
the mystery here is not so
much what happens these states,

327
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,600
but what happens in the normal strength
that gives us or our impression of the

328
00:20:52,601 --> 00:20:57,601
passage of time now disability to tell
time and perceive the passage of time,

329
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:04,540
estimate how much time has elapsed
is not unique to humans in any way.

330
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,920
Um, all animals are, most
animals certainly have the
sense of the time of day.

331
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,170
They know they have circadian clock,

332
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:15,670
they can learn when food will
arrive, um, and so forth.

333
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:18,310
What is unique and humans,
however,

334
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:22,450
is probably our ability to engage
in what we call mental time travel.

335
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,960
So we can think about the past and relive
our memories and we experience things

336
00:21:30,431 --> 00:21:33,490
that we have already experienced.
Um,

337
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:36,820
and sort of study that,
right? We can learn,

338
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:39,490
we can reimagine a conversation we had.

339
00:21:39,491 --> 00:21:43,600
We can give it alternate endings to
test out whether we should have said

340
00:21:43,601 --> 00:21:46,870
something different, um, or
not. But even more importantly,

341
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,000
we can imagine the future.

342
00:21:49,001 --> 00:21:53,410
We can project ourselves into the future
and simulate the future in our heads.

343
00:21:53,411 --> 00:21:57,520
And some people believe that this is
indeed why consciousness involved evolved,

344
00:21:57,521 --> 00:21:58,240
so the consciousness,

345
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,040
a way to simulate the future and and
this is what makes humans humans, right?

346
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:08,040
Whether it's your ability to the first
person to carve a knife or a weapon out

347
00:22:08,921 --> 00:22:12,850
of an obsidian stone must
have had something in mind.

348
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,320
What am I going to use this for?

349
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:19,620
So this ability to think about what this
will be used for in the future seems to

350
00:22:20,231 --> 00:22:22,060
evade the ability of most animals.

351
00:22:22,061 --> 00:22:27,040
So you take one of the most important
inventions of humankind agriculture,

352
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:30,130
right? It's a hard concept and
we take for granted, right?

353
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:33,040
I'm going to plant something now and
reap its benefits that are going to

354
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:34,660
guarantee survival a year from now.

355
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,440
This ability to link sure to link cause
and effect actions across large Delta

356
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:46,530
t's long periods of time
is very unique to humans.

357
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,570
I've always wondered if if humans are
only the only species that have figured

358
00:22:49,571 --> 00:22:52,090
out the relationship between
sex and pregnancy, right?

359
00:22:52,091 --> 00:22:56,590
That's a fairly long period of time
to just can other animals grasp that

360
00:22:56,591 --> 00:23:00,790
relationship because it spans
periods of weeks or months.

361
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:05,020
Now looking into the
future can be a bummer,

362
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:06,761
right?

363
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:11,761
Because the first humans to really see
the future in rasp saw something they

364
00:23:12,861 --> 00:23:16,810
probably didn't like. Right. And,
um, this might have been, by the way,

365
00:23:16,811 --> 00:23:19,350
a good time to invent religion
when you first started.

366
00:23:19,351 --> 00:23:23,880
See understanding what the future
holds. And I think this point is, um,

367
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:27,060
beautifully made by, um, harsher Luis,

368
00:23:27,061 --> 00:23:30,820
but barges to be a mortal is
common place except for man,

369
00:23:30,821 --> 00:23:33,700
all creatures are immortal
for their ignorant of death.

370
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:37,820
So certainly seeing into
the longterm future, um,

371
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:42,760
is what characterizes our
species in many ways. Um,

372
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:45,560
but it also has,
um,

373
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:50,650
affect our culture in many ways and
how we cope with what we've seen now.

374
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:51,943
Um,

375
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:58,820
just because humans are uniquely able,
and I'm sorry, there's a quantity.

376
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:02,990
One more button I'm going to need pressed
over there for the next movie. Um,

377
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:08,240
I didn't look far enough into the
future to anticipate this. Sorry. Um,

378
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:09,560
so,
um,

379
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:14,300
just because human beings are uniquely
able to engage in mental time travel,

380
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:18,950
it doesn't mean we're actually
particularly good at it. Right. And, um,

381
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:24,400
so learning to delay gratification and
learning to withhold immediate rewards

382
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:27,020
for,
um,

383
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:31,070
longer term benefits is something
our species is uniquely able to do.

384
00:24:31,071 --> 00:24:35,480
But it's also something we struggle with.
So here's the gratuitous child,

385
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:39,320
cute baby video of the talk.
You can start that please.

386
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:43,590
And this is the famous marshmallow
experiment on that plane.

387
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:49,250
Doesn't look like it's going to play
here. Um, oh, we're probably okay.

388
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:52,820
Just pride pressing.
Enter something there.

389
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,060
That's okay. We'll do it without it. Um,

390
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:05,340
we'll do it with do without the gratuitous
video of kids eating marshmallows.

391
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:09,480
Um,
so the marshmallow experiment,

392
00:25:09,481 --> 00:25:11,130
as many of you probably know,

393
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:16,170
is an experiment in which they say they
get four or five year olds in saying,

394
00:25:16,171 --> 00:25:18,210
okay, here's one marshmallow. Um,

395
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,120
you can eat it now or you can wait until
I come back and then you're going to

396
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:25,730
get two marshmallows. And, um,

397
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,820
this ability to delay gratification is
indeed part of what it means to grow up,

398
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:34,890
to be able to withhold your immediate
gratification, um, for later reward.

399
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,610
And these studies later
showed these studies by, um,
alter Michelle at Stanford.

400
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,440
Um,
that started in the 70s,

401
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:45,470
and he later track down many of these
children and he found a correlation,

402
00:25:45,751 --> 00:25:46,950
a weak correlation,

403
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:50,940
but correlation nevertheless
with their ability to withhold,

404
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:54,170
to wait to withhold gratification,
um,

405
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:58,920
at the young age with later on sat scores.
Um,

406
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:04,040
so there's indeed there's many pieces
of evidence that there's a correlation

407
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:10,460
between what we call temporal discounting
or ability to postpone or patients

408
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:15,570
with, um, with health
issues as well. So, um,

409
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,480
the

410
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:25,010
major issue there of course is that much
of what we do is contingent upon our

411
00:26:26,221 --> 00:26:31,221
understanding that what we do now has
consequences in the future and going to

412
00:26:33,241 --> 00:26:36,180
school, saving for retirement, um,

413
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:40,350
exercising are all things that we take
for granted but are implicitly contingent

414
00:26:40,351 --> 00:26:45,000
on our understanding of
temporal relationships, right,

415
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,130
of longterm temporary relationships.

416
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:52,250
But many of the problems
we face as individuals and
as members of society arise

417
00:26:52,801 --> 00:26:57,450
from not doing that well enough temporal
myopia. So personal credit card debt,

418
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,040
exercising uni healthy,

419
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:02,160
not saving enough for retirement
or things at the individual level,

420
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:07,370
which we struggle with in order to
balance our short term gratification with

421
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:11,550
long term rewards.
At the more,

422
00:27:11,551 --> 00:27:16,410
I'm not at the sort of societal
levels fader to adjust climate change,

423
00:27:16,411 --> 00:27:17,760
underfunded pension plans,

424
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:22,620
national debt are things that a societal
level or merge in part because of our

425
00:27:22,621 --> 00:27:27,621
failure to take appropriate actions in
the present to assure or guarantee a

426
00:27:29,101 --> 00:27:33,420
better quality of life or
health in the future. Now

427
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:39,920
humans as a sin are uniquely able
to think about the longterm future.

428
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,600
So how did that come about?

429
00:27:42,601 --> 00:27:47,250
What's unique about the human brain that
gives us the ability to understand the

430
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:50,100
fundamental difference between
the past, present, and future,

431
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:54,690
and to plan for months,
years, or even decades ahead?

432
00:27:55,680 --> 00:28:00,680
So some people have argued that we do
that in part because of our ability to

433
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:09,270
talk in language and because of the,
uh,

434
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:14,271
and use language and our brain's ability
to coopt to the parts of the brain that

435
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,440
are used to understand space.
The idea is,

436
00:28:19,441 --> 00:28:24,150
is that there's areas in the brains of
most mammals that allow them to navigate

437
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,820
and understand space in
a manner of speaking.

438
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,660
And maybe the human brain co-opted
those same structures, um,

439
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,640
to allow us to understand time.

440
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:38,060
And one argument in favor of this is
that a lot of the ways we talk about time

441
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:44,010
is by using spatial men metaphors.

442
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:49,190
So I might say it was a long day or I'm
looking forward to the clips or you're

443
00:28:49,591 --> 00:28:51,840
thinking,
I hope this talk shortly.

444
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:57,140
So we're using spatial metaphors
to talk about time and um,

445
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,470
so,
um,

446
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:06,600
this idea of the spatialization of time
is really one of the main ways we talk

447
00:29:06,601 --> 00:29:11,190
and discuss, um, and understand time.

448
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:16,220
And another way to exemplify this is
with what we call the Wednesday question.

449
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:20,430
So I'll say our Wednesday meeting
was moved forward two days,

450
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:26,730
what day is our meeting on
Monday or Friday?

451
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,860
So there's no right or wrong answer there,

452
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,540
but it does reflect two different
perspectives we have about time.

453
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,200
So if you view time as sort of fixed and
you're the one walking through time and

454
00:29:44,411 --> 00:29:45,244
you're moving,

455
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,660
then you'd say you move something
forward and from Wednesday it might go to

456
00:29:49,661 --> 00:29:52,690
Friday. That's sort of what we
call an ego moving perspective.

457
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,850
But if we have a time moving perspective,

458
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:59,940
you're probably in the Monday group
in which your static and like a river

459
00:29:59,981 --> 00:30:04,981
flowing time is like a river
flowing towards you and
that then the meeting would

460
00:30:05,501 --> 00:30:09,760
be on Monday. So there's these
two different perspectives
that people have, uh,

461
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:14,530
have about time and they just reflect
the ambiguity of language and the fact

462
00:30:14,531 --> 00:30:17,800
that we spatialized
time within our brains.

463
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:19,893
Um,

464
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:25,800
now this idea of the spatialization of
time that time is laid out in space is,

465
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:32,790
is very deep in the philosophical
literature as well as in physics because

466
00:30:36,461 --> 00:30:40,540
there's sort of two diverging theories
as to the true nature of time.

467
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:43,060
One is precisely this,

468
00:30:43,061 --> 00:30:47,200
that time is a dimension,

469
00:30:47,201 --> 00:30:48,190
much like space.

470
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:53,370
So this is called eternalism and
internal ISM under eternal wisdom.

471
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,330
The past,

472
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,600
the present and the future are all equally
real now is perfectly arbitrary now

473
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:05,290
as our,
as arbitrary as here,

474
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:10,000
just like here is a perfectly
valid point in space to be,

475
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:15,001
I'm perfectly fine with you being over
there in time now is arbitrary and I

476
00:31:15,131 --> 00:31:18,820
should be perfectly fine in internal ism.
Time is not always perfectly arbitrary.

477
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:22,960
And other versions of me or other
versions of you if you will,

478
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,480
are at past moments or present moment.

479
00:31:25,481 --> 00:31:30,190
So everything is equally real and
I'm under presentism in contrast,

480
00:31:30,191 --> 00:31:34,470
and this is sort of the more intuitive
sense we have in that only the present is

481
00:31:34,471 --> 00:31:36,610
real.
So the past was real.

482
00:31:36,611 --> 00:31:40,660
Some configuration of the universe that
we call past and now exists on the inner

483
00:31:40,661 --> 00:31:45,150
memories is real, was real, the
present is real in the future.

484
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:50,020
Some configuration of the universe at
some future point will become real based

485
00:31:50,021 --> 00:31:51,670
on what's happening in the present.

486
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:56,820
So of course it Turnell ism sort of
justifies a talk or a debate about whether

487
00:31:57,491 --> 00:32:01,450
time travel is possible. Does nothing
to do with the physics of time travel,

488
00:32:01,451 --> 00:32:02,770
whether you can actually do it or not.

489
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:08,130
But it Turnell ism justifies the debate
because at least there's moments in time

490
00:32:08,651 --> 00:32:12,850
that exist that you could potentially
try to travel to under presentism.

491
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:17,350
The talk of time travel is a moot
point because there's nowhere to go.

492
00:32:17,351 --> 00:32:20,650
There's no wind to go to be more precise.
Um,

493
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:26,010
now it terminal ism is sort of to the
degree that there is a standard view in

494
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,900
physics is the standard view.

495
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:34,620
And this is in part because of
Einstein's theory of special relativity.

496
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:41,720
So let me just try to convey, I find, um,

497
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,620
I find presentism to meet
be much more intuitive.

498
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:48,500
I think it's more consistent
with our experience,

499
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,490
but we believe in eternal wisdom,

500
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,950
at least in the physical
sense for very good reasons.

501
00:32:54,951 --> 00:32:59,690
So let me try to convey those reasons
or one of those reasons. So to do this,

502
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,500
let me go over a thought experiment,

503
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:08,480
an Einsteinian thought experiment in
which we have the following set up.

504
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:15,040
We have an observer on a stationary
platform and a train going by and a

505
00:33:16,941 --> 00:33:20,880
ludicrously impossibly
fast speed of two thirds.

506
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,600
The speed of light 0.6,
seven times the speed of light.

507
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:28,940
There's an individual in the middle of
the train that's shooting these space age

508
00:33:28,941 --> 00:33:31,880
bullets towards the front
and the back of the train.

509
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:35,630
Now if you're this individual,

510
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:41,280
it doesn't matter because of the laws
of physics and relativity that you're

511
00:33:42,291 --> 00:33:43,011
moving or not.

512
00:33:43,011 --> 00:33:46,340
So you're going to shoot the bullet
forward and the sh bullet backwards,

513
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:50,360
and those bullets have to travel
the same distance at the same speed.

514
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,960
So this pane of glass will break at
the same time as that pane of glass.

515
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,380
Now,
okay,

516
00:33:57,381 --> 00:34:00,830
so this person should observe that plane
of glass breaking at the same time as

517
00:34:00,831 --> 00:34:01,520
this person was.

518
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:06,520
Now here you're the observer and you're
going to see the train traveling at a

519
00:34:06,981 --> 00:34:07,814
high speed.

520
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:12,320
You're going to see this bullet traveling
in the opposite direction at the same

521
00:34:12,321 --> 00:34:15,740
speed. So this bullet we'll have speed
zero will have a loss of the zero.

522
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:20,040
So basically this bullet will be going,
um,

523
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:24,020
we'll just be standing in mid air as the
back of the train runs into the bullet.

524
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,300
Okay?
That's pretty straightforward.

525
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:30,740
Now this forward bullet should be going
at the speed of the bullet plus the

526
00:34:30,741 --> 00:34:31,574
speed of the train.

527
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,840
Now the speed of the bullet
is two thirds speed of light.

528
00:34:35,841 --> 00:34:37,610
The speed of the train is
two thirds speed of light.

529
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,760
So the sum of those is 1.3
times the speed of light.

530
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,820
Okay? That's a no, no. Right? We
can't go faster than speed of light.

531
00:34:46,821 --> 00:34:48,140
That's why Einstein told us.

532
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:50,960
So there's something goofy
that's going to happen here.

533
00:34:50,961 --> 00:34:53,990
This bullet can't be traveling
as fast as it needs to be.

534
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:58,160
Going to break this pane
of glass at the same time.

535
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:03,490
So we see the bullet in motion approaching
the panes of glass and the person on

536
00:35:06,141 --> 00:35:11,120
the train will observe both
panes breaking at the same time.

537
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,400
There'll be breaking simultaneously,

538
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:17,870
but the person on the stationary train
on the stationary platform will not see

539
00:35:17,871 --> 00:35:22,871
that happen and it has nothing to
do with delays or the time it takes

540
00:35:22,881 --> 00:35:24,500
information to get from here to there.
Okay?

541
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:29,680
This is just based on all
those adjustments and delays
being taken into account.

542
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:36,080
So this person will observe a different
reality while this person has a reality

543
00:35:36,081 --> 00:35:41,081
in which both pre panes of glass break
at same time for this person's reality,

544
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:44,760
this, there'll be a moment in time
where this is broken, but that is not.

545
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,450
So this is taken as an argument.

546
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:53,510
This lack of absolute simultaneity is
taken an argument for the block universe

547
00:35:54,271 --> 00:35:58,560
or for eternalism.
So why is that?

548
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,710
So let me give it again, run that
through you with this example here.

549
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:07,100
So let's look at this sort of our mini
block universe with four dimensions.

550
00:36:07,501 --> 00:36:10,860
But we're going to own the plot to
instead of the three spatial dimensions,

551
00:36:10,861 --> 00:36:14,070
we only have one. And we have this
temporal dimension dimension. So the,

552
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:18,480
for the person on the train,
this is their plane of simultaneity.

553
00:36:18,481 --> 00:36:23,070
There's a moment where both panes of
glass at the back of the chain and at the

554
00:36:23,071 --> 00:36:24,780
front of the train are both intact.

555
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:27,930
There's another moment in
exactly the same moment.

556
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,520
We're both panes of glass break.

557
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,770
Then there'll be another moment in time
where both glad panes of glass are ultra

558
00:36:34,771 --> 00:36:38,530
already bumpkin. So these are
the planes of simultaneity, um,

559
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:43,470
for the person on the train. Now
the person on the platform, um,

560
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:47,490
the, in reality, the person
on the platform is, is,

561
00:36:47,491 --> 00:36:49,470
is in our analogy not moving,

562
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:53,010
which is the same thing as from the
perspective of the person on the train.

563
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:55,950
That person on the platform is
moving in the opposite direction.

564
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:59,250
So if we just for reasons here, this is
going to be easier to explain that way.

565
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,200
So the person on the platform is sort of
traveling in the opposite direction of

566
00:37:04,201 --> 00:37:06,090
the person on the train.

567
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:11,780
Now these planes of simultaneity don't
match up for the person on the platform.

568
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:17,400
So the plane of simultaneity,
special relativity,

569
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:21,180
Einstein's theory of special relativity
tells us that these moments will be the

570
00:37:21,181 --> 00:37:23,370
same on these persons clock.

571
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,420
So there'll be a moment where the front
pain is not broken in the back one is.

572
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:32,190
So the point is is that
it's as if the universe,

573
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,740
everything that can happen
has already happened.

574
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,670
And the reason some things appear
simultaneous for one person and not for

575
00:37:38,671 --> 00:37:40,620
another is a question as perspective.

576
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,310
So here the idea is is from
this person's perspective,

577
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,220
these events are aligned
but not for this person.

578
00:37:47,221 --> 00:37:52,200
So this is one of the arguments for it
to journalism or the block universe.

579
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,850
Now there's a clash here,
right? If this is true,

580
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:02,120
it sort of leaves our impression of the
flow of time as an illusion because if

581
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,770
everything has already happened,

582
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:10,040
the clear subjective feeling that time
is flowing would seem that it has to be

583
00:38:10,471 --> 00:38:13,430
an illusion, a certain sense. And, and um,

584
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:17,070
physicists have long been aware of this.
So this seems,

585
00:38:17,071 --> 00:38:18,690
this is a quote from Roger Penrose.

586
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:22,350
It seems to me that there's a severe
discrepancy or there's serve your

587
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:26,130
discrepancies between what we consciously
feel concerning the flow of time and

588
00:38:26,131 --> 00:38:29,340
what are theories assert about
the reality of the physical world.

589
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,360
It's another good quote by Herman Veil,

590
00:38:31,361 --> 00:38:35,890
a physicist from the mid 19 hundreds.

591
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:40,750
The objective world simply is it does
not happen only to the gays of my

592
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:43,840
consciousness crawling upward
along the world line of my body.

593
00:38:43,841 --> 00:38:47,560
Does the section of the world come
to life as a fleeting image in space,

594
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,480
which continuously changes in the time.

595
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:53,650
So they're getting to this issue that the
illusion that the flow of time must be

596
00:38:53,651 --> 00:38:54,484
an illusion.

597
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:59,550
So this severely clashes with the
neuroscience of time and she clearly sees

598
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:04,420
fields that the subjective
experience of time is flowing by.

599
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,930
Um,
now

600
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:14,800
the question is, is if this is consistent
with our experience of consciousness,

601
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:16,930
now we don't really know
what consciousness is.

602
00:39:16,931 --> 00:39:20,140
So this is a very difficult
question to, uh, to address.

603
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:25,590
But consciousness probably isn't what it
seems to be in the sense that it seems

604
00:39:27,821 --> 00:39:32,821
to be providing a linear narrative of
what's happening in the world around us.

605
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:35,463
Rather,

606
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:41,070
the unconscious mind seems to be creating
this narrative in chunks and then

607
00:39:41,651 --> 00:39:45,460
feeding this into the conscious mind or
creating the conscious mind, if you will,

608
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:46,690
um,

609
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:51,670
to create a convenient and
apparent flow of what's happening.

610
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:53,470
So there's a couple of
illusions that show this.

611
00:39:53,471 --> 00:39:56,050
It's a bit of a hard concept to explain,

612
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:58,390
but let me just try to give
you a quick example here.

613
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:03,100
I'm going to say two sentences and just
pay attention to the meaning of the

614
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:08,020
sentences. So the first sentence is
the mouse pad was beside the computer.

615
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:11,200
Second sentence,
the mouse was hungry.

616
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:16,930
So in both of sentences, the meaning of
the word mouse was very different. Right?

617
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:20,080
So I think you're able to
understand that in the first case,

618
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:24,820
the mouse referred to an object, um, the
computer pad, mouse pad, and the second,

619
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:27,040
um, you know, to erosion,

620
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:31,030
but the meaning of mouse could only be
determined by the words that came after.

621
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:34,870
You can't impossibly interpret
that sentence in real time.

622
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,040
The mouse pad or the mouse was hungry.

623
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,520
So what comes after has to influence
your interpretation of what came before.

624
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:50,200
So this is one of the lines of evidence
that suggests that our conscious

625
00:40:50,201 --> 00:40:54,670
experience is not so much a continuous
linear flow of the world around us,

626
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:59,850
but of a creation that is generated
in sort of fits and bursts of,

627
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:06,580
um, of interpretation of
what's happening around us.

628
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:12,150
So it may be the case
that our understanding of
consciousness may or may not be

629
00:41:12,701 --> 00:41:15,940
compatible with the
standard view in physics.

630
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,460
I think Steven pinker was,

631
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:22,330
was hinting at this when he stated
matter is extended in space,

632
00:41:22,331 --> 00:41:27,220
but consciousness exists in time as surely
as it proceeds from I think too, I am.

633
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,000
So we have to decide and
I think physicists and
neuroscientists to collaborate

634
00:41:35,361 --> 00:41:40,361
more to decide if we should view our
subjective sense of the passage of time as

635
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,650
an empirical observation
about the universe.

636
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:50,950
One that has to be explained by physics
or if it's an illusion in the deepest

637
00:41:51,231 --> 00:41:54,980
sense of the world and thus one that
doesn't have to be explained by physics,

638
00:41:54,981 --> 00:41:57,410
but then has to be
explained by neuroscience.

639
00:41:57,411 --> 00:42:01,280
How does the brain generate the conscious
subjective feeling of something that

640
00:42:01,281 --> 00:42:06,281
has no correlation in the physical
world that is of the flow of time now,

641
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:14,690
um, to address these questions,
I think we have a long way to go.

642
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:19,010
And neuroscience is a very unique field,

643
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:19,871
neuroscience,

644
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:24,500
so unique field in all of sciences
because neuroscience is the only field in

645
00:42:24,501 --> 00:42:28,790
which the Oregon or the thing being
studied is also doing the study.

646
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:33,380
And this raises a couple of potential
concerns, right? And not least of which,

647
00:42:33,381 --> 00:42:36,950
well, and is that even possible?
Can something understand itself?

648
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:42,530
It's of course, way too early to
say to answer that question. Um,

649
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:46,160
but as scientific fields evolve,
as they mature,

650
00:42:46,161 --> 00:42:51,161
part of that maturation process
is to progressively embrace time.

651
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:56,400
You look at, um, what I would consider
the first field of modern science, uh,

652
00:42:56,570 --> 00:43:01,490
geometry. Geometry is formalized
by Euclid 2000, 300 years ago. Um,

653
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,610
it was highly influential
and transformative.

654
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:07,160
But why was it the first field of science?
Well,

655
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:10,130
it was the first field of science because
science is easier if you can ignore

656
00:43:10,131 --> 00:43:13,580
time. That's what geometry is, right?

657
00:43:13,581 --> 00:43:17,540
Geometry is the study of space and
objects that don't change in time.

658
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:23,030
It was on the round 2000
years after Euclid when, um,

659
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:28,090
people such as Galileo and Newton came
along and fully integrated time into time

660
00:43:29,321 --> 00:43:33,440
and dynamics into physics.
Same thing in biology.

661
00:43:33,441 --> 00:43:36,440
You think about biology up in 17 hundreds,
most of the 18 hundreds.

662
00:43:36,441 --> 00:43:40,460
It was largely texts a, not tech,
sonic, economic and fairly static.

663
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:45,080
And then Darwin playing the
role of Galileo said, hey, um,

664
00:43:45,081 --> 00:43:48,710
species are dynamic. They change,
they adapt, they evolve in time.

665
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:53,390
I think neuroscience is only reaching
this renaissance now where it's fully,

666
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:58,130
I'm beginning to embrace time and
realize that the brain is in a sense a

667
00:43:58,131 --> 00:44:01,520
temporal Oregon. It's a time
machine, if you will. It tells time,

668
00:44:01,521 --> 00:44:03,170
it remembers the past
to predict the future.

669
00:44:03,171 --> 00:44:07,460
It allows us to mentally time travel
and creates the subjective sense of the

670
00:44:07,461 --> 00:44:08,294
flow of time.

671
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:13,040
So elucidating how the brain tells time
represents and conceptualize this time

672
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:17,180
is critical to understanding the human
mind and the nature of consciousness.

673
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:18,740
Thank you very much.

674
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:24,150
[inaudible]

675
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,280
all right.
Have a question

676
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:36,270
or several gear. Yeah. Uh, yeah.
First question, it's about the,

677
00:44:36,271 --> 00:44:41,271
your claim that humans are unique pay in
the sense that the week I'm foreseeing

678
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,133
the future,

679
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:47,010
but there has been a lot of studies in
I most like spitting on monkeys where

680
00:44:47,011 --> 00:44:49,410
they can plan for the day,
whether they're going to do that.

681
00:44:49,411 --> 00:44:54,150
They wake up every morning and they,
they go and get some fixed.

682
00:44:54,151 --> 00:44:58,630
If they don't go for the things,
they will just stay awake later. Um,

683
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:03,550
so it's, it's kind of like weak
argument with the ugs made it.

684
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:04,583
What sense do you,

685
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:07,620
it's called mental time travel.

686
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:11,550
And the debate about whether other animals
can engage in mental time travel is

687
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,211
an active one.

688
00:45:12,211 --> 00:45:16,470
What's there's no debate about is the
extent to which humans can engage in

689
00:45:16,471 --> 00:45:17,251
mental time travel.

690
00:45:17,251 --> 00:45:21,210
So no other animal can talk about plans
five years in the future because no

691
00:45:21,211 --> 00:45:25,590
other animals can conceive or can
communicate about that. But interestingly,

692
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:30,620
the best animal data and the possibility
of Thai of mental time travel in the

693
00:45:30,621 --> 00:45:34,790
animals, it's not for monkey.
So the monkeys data is
fairly debated. The people,

694
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:39,860
the major test people use there is if
monkeys can learn to use money because

695
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:43,410
monkey money is something that
implicitly requires. This has no value.

696
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,840
This has no value, right?
Paper has no value.

697
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:49,560
It only has value because I assume that
in the future I can exchange it for

698
00:45:49,561 --> 00:45:52,380
something better. So they
tried to teach monkeys, apes,

699
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:56,610
great apes to use money by changing for
tokens and they can sort of get it to

700
00:45:56,611 --> 00:46:00,240
hang. But this is highly debated. But
so that data's still controversial,

701
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:04,220
but the best data actually
comes from birds. Um,

702
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:09,060
and there's corvids scrub jays
that the best argument comes from.

703
00:46:09,061 --> 00:46:13,030
They can seem to, if they're all in, oh,

704
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:18,040
always exposed to one part
of their [inaudible] area
in the morning and one part

705
00:46:18,451 --> 00:46:19,284
in the afternoon.

706
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:24,560
They seem that they can plan ahead by
putting the food in the part of the

707
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:29,490
morning, a varium, um, and
not in afternoon name. So
this is an active field,

708
00:46:29,491 --> 00:46:34,010
the debate. Um, but um,
part of the debate is,

709
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:37,110
is just one of extent. Um,
and humans clearly can,

710
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:40,660
can cross years and centuries
now other animals can.

711
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:44,540
Yep. Another question. You
were mentioning this kind of

712
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:50,030
view, we'll be doing the
condominium, that fiscal explanation,

713
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:51,260
the deck,

714
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:56,060
the foundation of where we stand
with time as we move forward.

715
00:46:56,150 --> 00:47:00,350
Uh, but there is like a physical sense
where you can put that can Arrow of time,

716
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:04,460
the, these all the sons, all of
entropy like university validity.

717
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:08,150
So they're just like an
objective physical sense.

718
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:13,670
You can say that the pain that
moves forward not kind of,

719
00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:19,310
so in the block universe,
everything is already laid out,

720
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,550
but there's still an Arrow of time.
Um,

721
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:27,590
because there's a forward Arrow in which
things go one way and not the other way.

722
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:31,870
As you probably know,
the laws of physics are time asymmetric.

723
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:35,710
You can run Newton's equations or
Einstein's equations or even Schrodinger's

724
00:47:35,711 --> 00:47:38,200
equation, forwards or
backwards. There's no time.

725
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:41,360
So the typical explanation
to address the Arrow,

726
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:45,280
the Arrow of time is as you
brought up the entropic era,

727
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:49,600
that entropy increases now and to
be by itself doesn't explain there.

728
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:52,960
What it does is just say
it provides any symmetry.

729
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:58,200
The real explanation comes from the fact
that the universe seems to have started

730
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:02,740
in a state of low entropy.
And from there it can only go up.

731
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:08,130
But the tricky thing about entropy is if
I say there's a state of medium entropy

732
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:12,190
here that predicts that the next
time step it should be higher.

733
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:13,391
But if you think about it,

734
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:15,760
it also predicts that the previous
time step should be higher.

735
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:20,050
So then tropic Arrow is sometimes
called the bi directional arrow.

736
00:48:20,051 --> 00:48:23,500
That doesn't explain the
ire of time by itself.

737
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:27,580
It needs to be coupled with an
assumption about a lower initial stage.

738
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:35,360
Um,
so first of all,

739
00:48:35,361 --> 00:48:37,790
and I'm not saying this to person
who anyone, but I'm an atheist,

740
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:41,000
but when I look at the, uh, the, uh,

741
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:45,070
eternalism worldview that
block the lock world, you know,

742
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:48,650
we can look at a person
as a baby in a person,

743
00:48:48,651 --> 00:48:53,651
as an adult and practically or all or
all cells have their body have since died

744
00:48:55,131 --> 00:48:57,580
and been replaced. They are, and there's,

745
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:02,300
that's a topic in itself like what makes
me me like, like I feel like design, but,

746
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:07,190
but if I look at the block universe,
um, as, as you depicted it, um,

747
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:13,370
and say, okay, space and time is all there
is and, and, and it all exists already,

748
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:18,670
then it brings about a philosophical
question of what links the slice where I

749
00:49:18,771 --> 00:49:20,000
was a baby in this slice,

750
00:49:20,001 --> 00:49:25,001
where I'm in the adult to create a
consciousness that views both as the same

751
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:29,930
thing. Right? So it almost suggests
bend the additional layer. No,

752
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:34,250
no, no. I think you, the question of
consciousness is perplexing either way,

753
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:38,240
whether what makes you you or makes
me mean what consciousness is.

754
00:49:38,241 --> 00:49:43,220
I think that's a dilemma. A challenge to
science, whether you're participating,

755
00:49:43,221 --> 00:49:46,130
whether you subscribe to the turtles,
fewer the present dispute, right?

756
00:49:46,131 --> 00:49:47,690
Consciousness.
We can't explain either way.

757
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:51,920
But I think there's a
further challenge of,

758
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:53,150
um,

759
00:49:53,330 --> 00:49:57,650
posed by the journalist view when it
comes to consciousness in terms of if

760
00:49:57,651 --> 00:50:02,060
things aren't flowing,
changing in a dynamic fashion,

761
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:06,800
why do we have this clear, distinct
feeling? And more importantly,

762
00:50:06,801 --> 00:50:11,680
what's the evolutionary
function of feeling time
change if there's no correlate

763
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:15,440
with the actual universe, it's not like
something we perceive color, right?

764
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:17,390
Color is the creation of the human mind,
right?

765
00:50:17,391 --> 00:50:20,240
Because there's no color
in the physical world.

766
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:24,110
There's wavelengths of electromagnetic
radiation. We interpret that as color,

767
00:50:24,111 --> 00:50:28,010
but that has a very strong adaptive value.
So there's a there. So the question is,

768
00:50:28,011 --> 00:50:31,880
is if we see if we feel time flowing,
but it actually doesn't,

769
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:34,400
what's that function from
an evolutionary perspective?

770
00:50:34,401 --> 00:50:37,160
And I think that's the mystery
that will probably have for awhile.

771
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:42,750
Hi. Thanks for coming. Uh,

772
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:47,350
so what's the difference between the
mental time travel and like fantasy,

773
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:51,310
uh, you know, like telling
myself a story about the future.

774
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:56,230
What I mean is like an example is I could
tell myself a story that I will go to

775
00:50:56,231 --> 00:51:00,380
the store later and it will be
open. Um, but that might not be so,

776
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:03,880
so is there like a probability
element wrapped up in there or,

777
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:05,840
I think the question,
interesting question is,

778
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:09,060
could we even have stories if we
couldn't have mental time travel?

779
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:11,610
Can other animals have stories?

780
00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:15,930
And whether that story takes place in
the future or the present or the past,

781
00:51:15,931 --> 00:51:20,430
right? You haven't gone later on and
we're going to go to the museum. Um,

782
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:23,940
and so is that a story?
Is that a plan or is that a fiction?

783
00:51:23,941 --> 00:51:26,430
So what makes humans unique,

784
00:51:26,431 --> 00:51:31,431
I believe is that what makes us creative
is this fine line between stories and

785
00:51:35,491 --> 00:51:37,770
reality.
So if,

786
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:42,750
if I'm primitive man and it's
a story, oh, I wish I could,

787
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:47,430
um, hunt down a, um, a mammoth,

788
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:50,880
you know, is that a story? But then
you're thinking, well, if I had a weapon,

789
00:51:50,881 --> 00:51:51,631
maybe I could.

790
00:51:51,631 --> 00:51:56,631
So this marriage of the stories and
reality I think is probably what's driving

791
00:51:57,810 --> 00:52:02,810
much of our technology and creativity
is this very delicate balance between

792
00:52:03,541 --> 00:52:07,230
getting the stories just so
that it sounds like fiction,

793
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:11,600
but it's fiction we can create
in the future. Sure. Yeah.

794
00:52:11,601 --> 00:52:16,090
I would just say we're almost
always wrong. Absolutely.

795
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:20,630
Until we've seen a repeatable
path. That sounds good. I,

796
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:22,990
I certainly feel that
I'm almost always wrong,

797
00:52:22,991 --> 00:52:27,850
I assume pumped and people are
often right. But, um, yeah,

798
00:52:27,851 --> 00:52:30,550
I mean there's trial and error and
stochasticity in there. Absolutely.

799
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:35,050
And we can't know in advance. It's so,
so if the future hasn't been laid out,

800
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:38,140
clearly we don't have access to it.
All right. Thanks. You're welcome.

801
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:44,370
Thanks so much for, this is great. Thank
you. Um, are you familiar with the, um,

802
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:49,410
Donald Hoffman? No. Uh, he's,
um, he's like a physicist,

803
00:52:49,411 --> 00:52:53,310
philosopher. He's got interesting
theories about consciousness.

804
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,520
The fact is I'm probably
gonna Butcher this theory,

805
00:52:56,521 --> 00:53:00,090
but I think essentially it's that
consciousness is the base of reality and

806
00:53:00,091 --> 00:53:01,890
everything else was like on top of it.

807
00:53:02,370 --> 00:53:06,890
So he claims to have proven that,
uh,

808
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:09,930
what is it?
Like everything we know,

809
00:53:09,931 --> 00:53:14,880
everything we see is just based on like
is this will be reconstructed because it

810
00:53:14,881 --> 00:53:18,270
was evolutionary missionary adaptable.
It was like a good thing for us.

811
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:21,630
Do you think time could be
something similar to that?

812
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:26,760
So there's this very interesting debate
about whether time is so some fields or

813
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:32,340
hypotheses and physics are
trying to get rid of time.

814
00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:35,410
So say that time doesn't exist.
Um,

815
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:39,660
and what this means is that
time is not a property.

816
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:42,030
They're not saying that time
clock time doesn't exist.

817
00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:46,500
What they're saying is that time isn't
a fundamental property of the universe.

818
00:53:46,501 --> 00:53:49,280
It's not like energy or matter.
Um,

819
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:52,440
and that time is simply an abstraction
of creation of the human mind.

820
00:53:52,441 --> 00:53:57,180
The way earn smock put this
is it's utterly impossible
to measure change by time

821
00:53:57,330 --> 00:54:01,800
because time is an abstraction at
which we arrive at by measuring change.

822
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:06,220
And that's indeed what clocks do.
All clocks are, or just some way,

823
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:10,770
some device that conveniently
standardize is change.

824
00:54:10,771 --> 00:54:15,240
Whether that changes swinging of a
pendulum. Mark Clark, quartz crystal.

825
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:19,830
So I the the subjective feeling of time,
I think I've,

826
00:54:19,831 --> 00:54:23,430
I've started with all the way expressed.
It's unknown, but the concept of time,

827
00:54:23,431 --> 00:54:24,410
I think I,

828
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:28,890
I do like the idea that it's
an abstraction that we've
created that's incredibly

829
00:54:28,891 --> 00:54:33,891
useful to help us understand the
universe and make sense of the world,

830
00:54:34,021 --> 00:54:35,970
but it's not a fundamental
property of physics.

831
00:54:39,490 --> 00:54:42,000
Um,
thanks for this talk by the way.

832
00:54:43,090 --> 00:54:48,090
I had some questions about your thoughts
on how are our relative conceptions of

833
00:54:50,761 --> 00:54:54,810
time are limited by physical
like dendrites, axons,

834
00:54:54,811 --> 00:54:56,550
physical barriers.

835
00:54:56,551 --> 00:55:00,720
So in a world where we are able to
create artificial intelligence or even

836
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:05,610
potentially upload our own consciousness
or replicate our consciousness in a

837
00:55:05,611 --> 00:55:09,420
world which isn't limited
by dendrites and axons,

838
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:14,980
uh Ha have you w what are your thoughts
on being able to extend our concepts of

839
00:55:17,281 --> 00:55:21,330
time because of those physical barriers
being removed for slowing down?

840
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:24,000
So a real person is existing.

841
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:28,860
There's an AI which
experiences at thousand years
of time because they're able

842
00:55:28,861 --> 00:55:30,900
to process information faster.

843
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:34,330
There's, there's a couple of issues there.
So those are, those are deep questions.

844
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:36,760
I mean, one is the hardware
question, right? Is,

845
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:39,700
is consciousness and our
subjective experience of time,

846
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:41,890
hardware dependent hardware limited,

847
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:46,150
can you create ais that have um,

848
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,430
consciousness totally equivalent to ours?

849
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:52,690
So that's a question that of course
nobody knows the answer to. I mean,

850
00:55:52,691 --> 00:55:53,950
as a materialist,

851
00:55:53,951 --> 00:55:57,700
I certainly believe there's no reason
that consciousness has to be hardware

852
00:55:57,701 --> 00:56:00,550
limited.
Now that question however,

853
00:56:00,551 --> 00:56:05,050
is different from the question
of speed of processing, right?

854
00:56:05,051 --> 00:56:07,930
So this question of sampling rate,
um,

855
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:11,680
in which the speed of processing
is ultimately independent of our,

856
00:56:11,681 --> 00:56:13,030
the notion of the passage of time,

857
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:18,210
you're processing signals that coming
from my speech that you're doing that

858
00:56:18,251 --> 00:56:22,960
right now that are far beyond the,
your subjective experience,

859
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:23,890
the passage of time.

860
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:27,670
So the brain clearly processes things
that are happening very quickly like this.

861
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:30,520
That's microseconds.
Your brain detects that.

862
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:34,030
So even though they're made of
neurons, it's incredible feat, right?

863
00:56:34,031 --> 00:56:37,060
Neurons have a time constant
of maybe an action potential.

864
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,160
So if you going to give
it a computer clock, ray,

865
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:43,210
you'd probably give it a kilo hertz
instead of a couple of hundred

866
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:48,160
Gigahertz, for example. So then, um,

867
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:52,600
so that time level of
processing is different from
the time level of subjective

868
00:56:52,601 --> 00:56:53,141
experiences.

869
00:56:53,141 --> 00:56:58,141
Now nobody knows the answer to the
question of whether an AI would,

870
00:56:58,600 --> 00:56:59,290
um,

871
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:04,180
be able to have these temporal distortions
of conscious experiences like you or

872
00:57:04,181 --> 00:57:08,770
I have. But I think, I think there's,
in a way it's the wrong question.

873
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:14,100
I think the mystery is not so much
how time comes to be distorted,

874
00:57:14,141 --> 00:57:18,400
how are in extreme cases of time,
dilation or time compression.

875
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:20,260
But what our normal sense of time is,

876
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:23,530
and I view this is just the flexibility
of conscience. Your conscience.

877
00:57:23,531 --> 00:57:27,310
You can be time conscious
of a short period of time
or long term period of time.

878
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:30,460
That's just a conscious state.
It's just a flavor of consciousness,

879
00:57:30,461 --> 00:57:32,710
just like pain or pleasure or color.

880
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:37,510
So I think that when we understand
the nature of consciousness,

881
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:40,830
the question of whether
it seems long or short,

882
00:57:40,831 --> 00:57:44,590
we'll be sort of a minor
issue along those lines.

883
00:57:44,591 --> 00:57:46,990
Because I think what we
perceive is a bit arbitrary.

884
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:51,370
Just the quick notes
where a bit or two pls.

885
00:57:51,371 --> 00:57:54,790
Let's not add more questions if you're
already in line as your questions.

886
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:57,290
Thank you all here. Um, uh,

887
00:57:57,291 --> 00:58:01,940
I want to ask about what is the difference
or are they the same thing for the

888
00:58:02,090 --> 00:58:05,660
things like a retrospective
retrospective thing? He,

889
00:58:05,661 --> 00:58:09,360
and so I'll talk about
graphic memory or x originals.

890
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:14,380
Back to thinking about a general loss of
memory or just some things about myself

891
00:58:15,141 --> 00:58:15,770
in the past.

892
00:58:15,770 --> 00:58:17,590
Yes, that's a good question. So, um,

893
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:21,720
autobiographical memory
or episodic memory is, um,

894
00:58:21,770 --> 00:58:25,010
about events in our own knife and
that's tightly coupled to how we

895
00:58:25,011 --> 00:58:27,950
retrospectively perceived time.
So if there's a period of time,

896
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:32,120
whichever rich autobiographical
memory I did this, this,
this, this, this, and this,

897
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:36,030
that's likely to elicit a
long estimate of time. Um,

898
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:40,940
whereas if you don't have any events in
memory, um, that's a short period of time.

899
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:44,510
The extreme example of this
is somebody who has amnesia.

900
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:49,900
So you can imagine if somebody has no
ability to form new episodic memories are

901
00:58:50,811 --> 00:58:51,770
autobiographical memories,

902
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:55,760
how could they even estimate
the power of time has elapsed?

903
00:58:55,761 --> 00:58:57,080
So there's this very touching,

904
00:58:57,110 --> 00:59:01,370
poignant case of a British
man called Clive wearing,

905
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:03,980
and you've maybe some of you have seen,
I'm specials on him,

906
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:09,400
but he has terrible anterograde Amnesia
and he believes he seems to be locked

907
00:59:10,401 --> 00:59:14,090
into the present. And there's a story
where he's writing in his diary,

908
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:18,440
9:00 AM I just woke up nine 30,
now I'm awake for the first time,

909
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:21,620
10 o'clock now, now I'm really
awake for the time. Right.

910
00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:23,150
Because if you don't have that memory,

911
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:27,320
how can you know how much time has
elapsed so clearly, retrospectively,

912
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:29,660
time and memory are tightly coupled.

913
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:32,093
Yeah.

914
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:34,320
Um, so as you said, uh,

915
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:38,740
all of our time keeping devices rely
on oscillators or rely on some kind of

916
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:41,980
notion of periodicity.
And so, um, kind of,

917
00:59:42,550 --> 00:59:44,830
I guess my question is like,
if you,

918
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:49,180
so if you look at an oscillation
or assigned waiver, any
sort of, um, you know, any,

919
00:59:49,181 --> 00:59:50,920
any sort of phenomenon that
you can understand that way,

920
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:54,520
there's a notion of symmetry that's
really important that, you know,

921
00:59:54,521 --> 00:59:56,280
you could be at one point and,
um,

922
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:59,920
and it's also [inaudible] or it can be
at the exact same point and then another

923
00:59:59,921 --> 01:00:03,190
period later. So it gives you kind
of that, that eternal perspective.

924
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:06,010
What if that didn't exist? So, you know,

925
01:00:06,011 --> 01:00:10,150
like how would we measure time if we
didn't have this sort of repeatable,

926
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:13,360
you mean you mean manmade time,
right? Clock time, you mean?

927
01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:14,970
Well,
I guess what I'm asking is like,

928
01:00:14,971 --> 01:00:19,870
is there something fundamental about
the idea of like periodicity or no,

929
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:22,880
I never, well, I'm just
like, yeah, how was it?

930
01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:25,950
It wasn't something that was symmetric
that we could always kind of stuff.

931
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:29,320
So, no, I don't think so. I think
it sits just reproducibly, I mean,

932
01:00:29,321 --> 01:00:32,860
you can measure time by,
um,

933
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:36,400
an hourglass is something that's not,
doesn't have to be periodic.

934
01:00:36,401 --> 01:00:39,250
So I think manmade clocks,
um,

935
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:43,600
rely on this mechanism because it's an
incredibly useful, symmetric one. Right?

936
01:00:43,601 --> 01:00:45,780
And it's the best way to
do something continuously.

937
01:00:45,781 --> 01:00:48,250
These with periodically
something that's periodic,

938
01:00:48,610 --> 01:00:52,570
but you need some sophisticated counter.
And that was really the main problem.

939
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:57,790
But if you look, even if
you look at something like,
um, planetary motion, right?

940
01:00:57,791 --> 01:01:01,060
You can tell the time of year by
looking at the position. Yeah,

941
01:01:02,350 --> 01:01:04,870
I've been with an hourglass. You could
turn it off. Like there's a kind of,

942
01:01:04,871 --> 01:01:05,704
but you don't have to,

943
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:08,490
you can't, you can, but you
don't have to write. Um,

944
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:11,940
you could have a non periodic
hourglass. So I think, um,

945
01:01:12,150 --> 01:01:14,730
periodicity is something
that in our minds,

946
01:01:14,731 --> 01:01:19,590
because of the success of manmade clocks
is something we naturally think of as

947
01:01:19,650 --> 01:01:23,000
the ideal way to tell time. And
it probably is, but interestingly,

948
01:01:23,001 --> 01:01:24,600
and I think there's a downside to that,

949
01:01:24,601 --> 01:01:28,290
which is people spent a bit too much
time looking for those oscillators,

950
01:01:28,291 --> 01:01:31,650
encounters in the brain. And I think
that through the field off the bit,

951
01:01:31,651 --> 01:01:36,000
because that's probably not how the brain
tells time. Yes, brain has oscillators,

952
01:01:36,001 --> 01:01:39,690
but it doesn't seem to have
many oscillator counter
system. So I think these,

953
01:01:39,691 --> 01:01:43,600
these metaphors we use in the
external world sometimes. Um,

954
01:01:43,650 --> 01:01:47,760
can you put us back a bit when we're
overly influenced by them? Thank you.

955
01:01:48,090 --> 01:01:52,970
Thank you. Thanks everybody for
coming and thanks dean. Thanks.

956
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:53,270
Yeah.
