00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,230
Welcome to this toxic Google
events in our Seattle office.

2
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,710
I have to admit that
since I was a little girl,

3
00:00:12,711 --> 00:00:17,570
I've been fascinated by space and stars
and planets and the universe and so it

4
00:00:17,571 --> 00:00:19,850
gives me a great pleasure to
introduce today's speaker.

5
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:25,870
David Sobel is a former New York Times
science reporter and he repeated New York

6
00:00:27,591 --> 00:00:28,910
Times bestselling author.

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,020
Her previous books include longitude
about the English clockmaker,

8
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,730
John Harrison and gala was daughter
about gallows older daughter,

9
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,700
Maria Celeste and planets,

10
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,970
which I'm sure you can guess is about
earth and her nearest neighbors.

11
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:49,400
She's a recipient of the National
Science Board's Individual Public Service

12
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,270
Award, the Boston Museum of
Science Bradford Washburn Award.

13
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:57,200
And she even has an asteroid
named after her. Please.

14
00:00:57,201 --> 00:00:58,850
Let's welcome David Sobel.

15
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:00,103
Thank you.

16
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,440
Thank you very much. Okay, thank you.

17
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:12,620
So I'm going to talk today about a
group of women who worked at the Harvard

18
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:17,420
Observatory starting in
the 1880 [inaudible]. And
the women in this picture,

19
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,150
I don't have a whole lot
to do with that story.

20
00:01:20,151 --> 00:01:23,780
They're kind of the granddaughters
of the original group.

21
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:28,670
Um, but the, the woman who's
picture is over the word glass,

22
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,530
that is Wendy Freedman,

23
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:35,860
who was a head of the Carnegie
observatories in Pasadena for years now.

24
00:01:36,111 --> 00:01:38,450
She's at University of Chicago.

25
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,770
And she gave me the idea for
this book about 20 years ago.

26
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:48,160
She was the head of a Hubble telescope
key project about the expansion rate of

27
00:01:48,201 --> 00:01:49,034
the universe.

28
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,300
And she mentioned the name
Henrietta 11 it to me.

29
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,940
And I had never heard of hand.
We had 11.

30
00:01:55,941 --> 00:01:58,430
And then when I went to
learn more about her,

31
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,560
turned out she was working in a
whole room full of women at Harvard.

32
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,300
And, um, that was surprising any,

33
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:12,250
any large number of women
anywhere at Harvard. Um,

34
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,560
but the Harvard Observatory where they
worked was really separate from the

35
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:23,261
university and there had always been
women working there and because several of

36
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:29,930
the astronomers just lived at the
observatory, so their wives, sisters,

37
00:02:29,931 --> 00:02:34,310
daughters got roped into doing
whatever needed to be done.

38
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,460
And there was a lot of computing work.

39
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:42,820
So this was an era when computer
was a job description and,

40
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,420
um, a lot of what they
were looking at, uh,

41
00:02:47,421 --> 00:02:49,220
were stellar positions.

42
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,300
That's mostly what astronomy
was about in the 19th century.

43
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,420
Mapping the stars,
figuring out positions,

44
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:01,810
and then the computers would have
make corrections for the atmospheric

45
00:03:02,831 --> 00:03:07,210
distortion for the Earth's
motion in space, uh,

46
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,160
procession. So there was,
was a lot of computing to do.

47
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,900
And then in 1877,

48
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,370
a very young physicist, Edward
Pickering, he was 29 years old,

49
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,900
uh,
took over as director

50
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:28,930
of the observatory.

51
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:34,620
And there was a lot of question about
whether he was the right person for this

52
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:38,020
because he was a physicist,
not an astronomer.

53
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:43,590
And he immediately got interested in
doing projects that would uncover the

54
00:03:45,251 --> 00:03:50,110
physics of the stars. He wasn't as
interested in just the position work.

55
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:51,130
He had to do that.

56
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:56,370
But he introduced other things as well
and he'd been teaching at MIT where he

57
00:03:56,681 --> 00:04:01,681
set up a laboratory so the physics
students could learn things for themselves

58
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:06,910
through experiments that
he, he, uh, set up for them.

59
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,551
And a,

60
00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:13,390
this is what the building looked like
in the early days was a wooden building

61
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:18,850
and there was, there were two
telescopes and then the directors,

62
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:23,910
residents was the part without the dome.
And uh,

63
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:28,920
one of the Pickerings first projects
was to try to determine the different

64
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:33,520
brightnesses of,
of the various stars.

65
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,270
So this was the main
instrument at the observatory.

66
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:41,860
This is a 15 inch telescope that was
a gift from the people of Boston.

67
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,360
And there's bickering in the chair. I
mean, I don't know if it's really him,

68
00:04:46,361 --> 00:04:50,710
but somebody who's somebody is
sitting there. So to do this work,

69
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:55,770
the brightness Worki had to build his
own photometers and at first he attached

70
00:04:56,531 --> 00:04:58,810
them to this instrument,
but later,

71
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,800
later they got more complex and had
their own telescopes attached to them.

72
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,370
And he was very interested in photography.

73
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:13,390
His younger brother was
a photography pioneer,

74
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,990
was also at MIT. And uh, this man,

75
00:05:16,991 --> 00:05:21,991
this is Dr. Henry draper who was a
medical doctor but was a real pioneer in

76
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,820
stellar photography.

77
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,350
And not just taking
pictures of star scapes,

78
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:37,830
but using prisms to split
the star light into Spectra.

79
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,470
And then photographing the spectrum.

80
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,910
And he was the only person who
was able to do that at the time.

81
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:50,970
And the, uh, the lady
there is his wife and uh,

82
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,680
they work together.
Um,

83
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:58,250
she became his full time assistant
and because he was an amateur,

84
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:03,580
he was free to do this unusual new
work that was not being done at other

85
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:08,510
observatories.
And because she was independently wealthy,

86
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:13,580
he could afford to build instruments,
take whatever time he needed.

87
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,950
And they were planning
to leave New York City,

88
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,550
they had a townhouse in New York City,
um,

89
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,530
but the had an observatory,
uh,

90
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:30,620
up the Hudson River and they were going
to go devote themselves full time to

91
00:06:30,621 --> 00:06:35,621
this project of photographing stellar
spectrum and then figuring out a

92
00:06:36,171 --> 00:06:41,171
classification system for the stars
based on differences in the spectrum.

93
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,410
And they had all their
affairs in order to do this.

94
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,330
And then he suddenly died.

95
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:52,780
He was 45 and she really
wanted to continue the work.

96
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:59,320
She thought she might get some assistance
to fill in her husband's knowledge and

97
00:06:59,901 --> 00:07:03,830
work with her,
but it turned out to be difficult.

98
00:07:03,831 --> 00:07:08,831
And so she offered Pickering the money
to do the work if he would just take over

99
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,760
this dream project.

100
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,560
And she wanted him to promise that
he would name it after her husband.

101
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,860
So it became the Henry Draper Memorial.

102
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,310
And uh,
so this is a textbook image of a spectrum.

103
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:33,290
That's what people usually think
of the rainbow and the, the um,

104
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,870
absorption lines.
Uh,

105
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,570
but of course there was
no color photography yet.

106
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,590
So the images look like this.

107
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:45,630
The enlarged images look like this.
Um,

108
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:49,850
Pickering's photographs look
like this mostly because,

109
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:54,260
uh, instead of putting the
spectroscope at the eye piece,

110
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:58,580
it was putting the prison, I'll be the
light gathering end of the telescope.

111
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:03,140
So he was getting hundreds
of spectrum in each image.

112
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,270
And um,

113
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:11,200
so the job was to look at those tiny
smears through a magnifying glass and then

114
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,710
come up with a system for classifying
the stars. The black spot is a penny.

115
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,030
And so with all this money,

116
00:08:23,031 --> 00:08:27,590
it misses Draper's money was the equal
of the entire operating budget of the

117
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:32,270
observatory.
So Pickering was free to hire more women.

118
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,680
He had found women working there when he
arrived and they were good at what they

119
00:08:36,681 --> 00:08:40,610
did and they were less expensive than men.
It's an old story.

120
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:45,230
It's still true in a lot
of places. Um, so, uh,

121
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:49,850
this is, this is what the
computing room looked like.

122
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:52,520
Uh,

123
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:57,520
this woman will you meet a Fleming had
come to the observatory to work as a

124
00:08:59,131 --> 00:08:59,964
maid.

125
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:05,090
She found herself suddenly
unmarried and pregnant and uh,

126
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,580
just applied for this job.

127
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:13,170
And then Pickering noticed how
intelligent she was and moved her into the

128
00:09:13,171 --> 00:09:15,060
observatory,
uh,

129
00:09:15,061 --> 00:09:19,710
where she learned how to do computations
and also how to look at photographs.

130
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,590
And she went home to have her baby,

131
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,660
but he promised her home to Scotland.

132
00:09:25,661 --> 00:09:30,150
She was a Scottish immigrant and he
promised her real job if she would come

133
00:09:30,151 --> 00:09:34,710
back. And she did. And um,

134
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,040
she made the first Henry Draper
classification of 10,000 stars,

135
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,360
which was published and
she was credited for it.

136
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:51,360
And then she became the first woman
to have a university title at Harvard.

137
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:54,750
She was the curator of
astronomical photographs.

138
00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:00,710
She also managed to bring the baby over
and put him through school at Mit and he

139
00:10:01,981 --> 00:10:03,390
became a mining engineer.

140
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:08,550
The very formidable looking woman at
the telescope here is Mariah Mitchell,

141
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:14,070
who was the first American woman who
really became famous as an astronomer

142
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:18,030
because she discovered a comet in 1847.

143
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:23,160
And the young woman and Tonia
Maury was Henry Drape was nice.

144
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,100
And um,

145
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:30,270
she went to Vassar college where Mariah
Mitchell was professor of astronomy.

146
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:35,670
So when Antonio Maury came to
work at Harvard on this project,

147
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:40,940
she had a very good background in
astronomy and she developed her own seller

148
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:47,100
classification system, which was much
more complicated than Mrs Fleming's.

149
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:52,470
Um, so for a while there
were two systems and uh,

150
00:10:52,471 --> 00:10:57,270
it took a third person to
balance out that,

151
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,230
uh,

152
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:03,230
situation and create something in the
middle that was so effective that it's

153
00:11:05,251 --> 00:11:09,300
still in use today.
And this is Annie jump cannon.

154
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,370
Uh, she was a graduate of
Wellesley College. So the,

155
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:19,580
these new women's colleges became feeder
schools to the project and Harvard.

156
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:24,630
And there was a lot of
controversy at the time,

157
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,530
whether higher education
was good for women. Uh,

158
00:11:28,531 --> 00:11:33,390
there was even a feeling that college
was actually bad for girls and that it

159
00:11:33,391 --> 00:11:36,810
would negatively affect their
ability to bear children.

160
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:41,000
I couldn't make that up. Um, uh,

161
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:45,150
but Pickering was all for it.
And not only was he hiring women,

162
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:50,540
but he was appealing directly to the
alumnae of these colleges and saying,

163
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,400
you know, if you've studied
astronomy, if you have a telescope,

164
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:59,620
there are observations we need to have
made and you could contribute to the

165
00:11:59,621 --> 00:12:04,090
work. And he got a lot
of takers for that. Um,

166
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:09,310
Ms. Cannon was the first woman at the
observatory who was not just looking at

167
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:13,330
photographic plates,
but making her own observations.

168
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,273
So the,
uh,

169
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:20,380
the painting of her at the telescope is
from a children's book called Annie Jump,

170
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,900
cannon astronomer by,
um,

171
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:26,750
Carol Gerber and the illustrations
invite Christina Waltz.

172
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:31,270
So here's what it,
Ms Canon's plates.

173
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:33,523
MMM.

174
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,160
It's not for everyone.

175
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,073
Okay.

176
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,990
And, uh, these are Ms Canon's diaries.

177
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:48,620
One of my concerns when I
took on this project was,

178
00:12:48,781 --> 00:12:49,380
um,

179
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:54,380
would I be able to make the women come
real in the story or were they just going

180
00:12:55,731 --> 00:12:59,820
to sound like one lady nerd
after another? And, uh,

181
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:04,910
fortunately the archival material was
rich and 40 years of Ms Canon's diaries.

182
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:13,080
I probably know her better than
I know some of my friends. And,

183
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:17,610
um, uh, this is thrilling
kind of work to do.

184
00:13:17,611 --> 00:13:22,611
I don't know if any of you've ever had
this experience of going to an archive,

185
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,200
but it's just,
um,

186
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:31,140
it always surprises me how
much is available just by
virtue of being interested

187
00:13:32,401 --> 00:13:34,680
in a subject.
This is

188
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:41,370
so just there for the asking.
So,

189
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,120
uh,
for,

190
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:47,120
in order for Pickering to create a
complete record of the night sky,

191
00:13:47,401 --> 00:13:48,840
which was what he wanted to do,

192
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:53,700
he had to have an observatory
in the southern hemisphere
as well as the northern

193
00:13:53,701 --> 00:13:58,080
hemisphere. And he sent this
ban. So when Bailey to, uh,

194
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,550
recognize order sites in South
America where they could, uh,

195
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:07,980
carry on the work too, and this
was their, their first spot,

196
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:10,710
uh,
they called this Mount Harvard,

197
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,590
very rustic.

198
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:19,160
And then they built a more permanent
installation near the town of Eric Keeper

199
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:23,700
in Peru in the Lee of a dormant volcano.

200
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,500
It'll misty and later it turned
out it wasn't so dormant, uh,

201
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:33,600
but they were there, uh, and
for the southern hemisphere,

202
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:37,740
Pickering wanted a new kind of telescope,

203
00:14:37,741 --> 00:14:42,160
which he designed specifically
for photography, uh,

204
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:44,490
and one that would take enormous plates.

205
00:14:44,491 --> 00:14:47,430
These were 11 inches by 17 inches.

206
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:52,760
And once again,
an interested Eris stepped forward,

207
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:57,590
wrote him a check for $50,000
to build this telescope,

208
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:01,790
which has her name. Her name
was Catherine Wolfe, Bruce.

209
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:04,890
And, uh, she also, uh,

210
00:15:04,891 --> 00:15:09,310
in Dowd astronomers
everywhere, she set up a, uh,

211
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,430
a grant pool.
And if you had a proposal,

212
00:15:13,431 --> 00:15:18,431
you could send it to her and Pickering
would do all the judging and she'd send

213
00:15:18,471 --> 00:15:20,390
you some money.
Um,

214
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:25,690
and she was also approached
by the Astronomical Society
of the Pacific to endow

215
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,410
a lifetime achievement
award for astronomers.

216
00:15:30,411 --> 00:15:34,520
And it remains a very prestigious
prize today. The Bruce Metal.

217
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,820
Uh, so life in Peru wasn't all, uh, uh,

218
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:45,440
fighting Scorpions and staying up all
night. They had picnics sometimes.

219
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:50,540
And, uh, this, this lady,

220
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:54,380
I'm not getting this to work.
There she is. That's Mrs. Bailey.

221
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,760
Ruth Poulter Bailey.

222
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,420
And she helped him in the work.

223
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,600
She did the meteorology observations
and she also helped in his studies.

224
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:12,500
He was especially interested
in globular clusters. Uh,

225
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:17,570
the dark skies in South America
really made these pop and he,

226
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:23,140
he was fascinated to see how many variable
stars there were in these clusters.

227
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,370
So even with the close up,

228
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:31,060
you can imagine the job it was to
count the stars in these images.

229
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:36,530
Uh, and, but when you got to the middle,
it was, it was really mission impossible.

230
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:43,070
Uh, Henry at 11, the first
name I learned of these women,

231
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:43,881
uh,

232
00:16:43,881 --> 00:16:48,881
she was given plates from the
Bruce Telescope to discover
as many variable stars

233
00:16:50,721 --> 00:16:51,554
as possible.

234
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:56,350
And so that meant not only
looking at the images but,

235
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:01,670
but then looking at them over time.
So you assess the brightness in one image,

236
00:17:01,671 --> 00:17:06,671
but then you keep assessing it as
you look at subsequent photographs.

237
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:11,240
And, uh, and this is the
small Magellanic cloud,

238
00:17:11,241 --> 00:17:14,450
which is not visible at all
from the northern hemisphere.

239
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,380
And uh,
so she was finding

240
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:25,120
about a thousand variables in this one
object and it struck her that all of the

241
00:17:28,731 --> 00:17:31,730
stars in the small Magellanic cloud,

242
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:34,310
we're roughly the same
distance from the earth,

243
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:38,990
so that it stars looked brighter
than they really were brighter.

244
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,780
And among the variables,

245
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:47,110
she made this very important discovery
that the brightest ones took the longest

246
00:17:48,081 --> 00:17:50,640
time to cycle through their changes.

247
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,440
And so that meant if you saw one of
those stars and another part of the sky,

248
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:03,840
and it had the same
period as one of these,

249
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,280
but it looked a lot dimmer
than it was a lot farther away.

250
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,620
And that was the beginning of a distance
scale for measuring the universe.

251
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:18,240
And that too is still
in use today. And, um,

252
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,100
there there's a movement afoot,

253
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:25,370
a successful movement to change its name
from the period luminosity relation to

254
00:18:26,281 --> 00:18:30,180
the Leavitt law.
Uh,

255
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,480
Harlow Shapley took over as director of
the observatory after Pickering died and

256
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:41,540
he used Ms Levitt stars to
determine the size of the Milky Way,

257
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:49,130
which was so gigantic that he assumed
that there were no other galaxies.

258
00:18:51,391 --> 00:18:54,150
This was a big debate at
the time was the Milky Way,

259
00:18:54,151 --> 00:18:59,151
the only one or was the milky
way one of many island universes.

260
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:04,770
And he felt when he realized the
extent of it, that it was the only one.

261
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:08,380
And he also figured out from,

262
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:12,210
from judging the distance to
all the globular clusters,

263
00:19:12,211 --> 00:19:16,470
he could see that the sun and planets,

264
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,200
we're nowhere near the
center of the Milky Way.

265
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,920
And he just took a perverse
delight in that and,

266
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:28,620
and kind of showing how
unimportant we were. And,

267
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:32,880
uh, he said that man is
not such a big chicken.

268
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:37,430
We're, we're really peripheral
to the universe. Um,

269
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,600
Shapleigh was also very
interested in ants. He got, uh,

270
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,950
he noticed them while he was working
at Mount Wilson and he studied them

271
00:19:46,951 --> 00:19:47,800
scientifically.

272
00:19:47,801 --> 00:19:52,470
He wrote several papers that were
published about add behavior.

273
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:53,601
So I,

274
00:19:53,601 --> 00:19:58,350
I wish he could have seen this cartoon
is a Charlie Hanken cartoon from the New

275
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:01,140
Yorker.
And since the caption doesn't show,

276
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:05,550
we could pretend it's one of
those contests that they do now.

277
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,200
Um,
but we don't have a lot of times,

278
00:20:08,201 --> 00:20:12,960
so I'll just tell you what it says
of makes you feel small, doesn't die.

279
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,400
Um,

280
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,400
as Shapley argued that when Harvard
really needed was a program in graduate

281
00:20:23,461 --> 00:20:25,960
level astronomy,
uh,

282
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:30,600
and he wanted to institute it
and he said if they'd had one,

283
00:20:30,601 --> 00:20:33,540
they wouldn't have had to
import him from California.

284
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:36,000
They could have promoted
from within the ranks.

285
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:41,340
And because of the history of
women at the observatory, uh,

286
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:46,150
there was a third Eris
Lydia hinge men who, uh,

287
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,250
was a relative Mariah Mitchell,

288
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:53,820
and who set up a program to pay for
a young woman to come and work at the

289
00:20:55,001 --> 00:20:59,830
observatory for a year and then go
on to have a job somewhere else.

290
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:05,140
And so when Shapley started
looking for graduate students,

291
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:10,560
the only fellowship support he had
were these fellowships for women.

292
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:16,830
So he recruited from the women's colleges
and all the early graduate students

293
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,980
were women. And the, um,

294
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:25,750
the smallest photo.
This,

295
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:29,110
this lady is a Cecilia Payne.

296
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,330
Later Cecilia Payne,
good Pushkin and she came to Harvard,

297
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:38,530
uh, from Cambridge, England. And uh,

298
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:43,360
partly she was attracted
by the ability to,

299
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,970
to think about a future
in astronomy in America,

300
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:49,360
which she knew it was going
to be impossible in England,

301
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:54,660
but also the plate collection that she
wanted to use the plates of the spectrum

302
00:21:55,931 --> 00:21:59,750
for her own research. And, uh,

303
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,880
she was the first person to earn
a phd in astronomy at Harvard.

304
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,710
And in the course of
her doctoral research,

305
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,190
she was trying,
she showed that the,

306
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:15,970
the different categories that
had been set up by the spectra,

307
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:19,270
that what they really signified
was stellar temperature.

308
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:25,380
And then she was looking at the spectrum
to assess the relative abundance of

309
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:30,340
different chemicals.
And she came,

310
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:35,520
came up with strikingly high percentages
of hydrogen and it just looked very

311
00:22:38,081 --> 00:22:40,870
odd.
It was not what anyone expected.

312
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:46,290
So her advisor Shapley and the reigning
authority on seller composition,

313
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:53,410
uh, told her not to make
too much of this, just say,

314
00:22:53,411 --> 00:22:57,160
okay, these were my findings, but
it's probably a spurious result.

315
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:00,070
And that's what she said
in her dissertation.

316
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:05,430
But she had called the tension to this
interest in problem and that got other

317
00:23:05,741 --> 00:23:10,741
people looking at it and it took only
four years for everyone to agree,

318
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:15,760
you know, it really is almost
all hydrogen and helium. So, uh,

319
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,740
that was her finding.
Uh,

320
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:24,970
so when some people have
heard about these women,

321
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:29,980
you often hear them referred to by
the derogatory term Pickering's Harem.

322
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:35,170
Um, but they, I want to stress,
they really were well treated,

323
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:39,580
well regarded. Uh, he
put them up for prizes.

324
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:42,850
They were members of the
American Astronomical Society.

325
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:48,390
They were even inducted as foreign
members of foreign astronomical societies.

326
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:54,800
Um, and they, they loved the
work they did. Nobody left.

327
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:59,510
People worked there for
30, 40, 50 years. Um,

328
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:03,170
and then they've, they've really, uh,

329
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:08,900
some of them achieved world
fame, especially Ms. Cannon. Um,

330
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:11,540
and shortly after she died,

331
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:16,580
she was featured in wonder woman comic
book as a real life wonder woman.

332
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:19,540
That's what this is.
Uh,

333
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:24,170
now she's in a current website
called rejected princesses.

334
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:29,960
And this is all about women
who are two awesome, awful,

335
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:33,170
or off beat to be
featured in a kid's movie.

336
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:40,880
Uh, this is a still from
the remade cosmos. Um,

337
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:46,310
did anybody see the original Cosmos
series with Carl Sagan? So he,

338
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:50,750
he was a tremendous
influence on me. And, um,

339
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:52,070
uh,

340
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:57,070
the original writers did the new series
and just used a Neil Tyson as the host.

341
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:01,940
But the new series contain
something the original didn't,

342
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:06,800
which was an episode about the Harvard
women called sisters of the Sun.

343
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,370
And so there's, and he can,
and at the light table,

344
00:25:10,371 --> 00:25:12,980
and that's Henrietta Leavitt
standing at the back.

345
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,230
And this has had a huge effect.

346
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:20,290
There are young people who've seen this
now and there are two new plays that had

347
00:25:20,481 --> 00:25:25,280
been written about the ladies and there's
a web series and production about them

348
00:25:25,281 --> 00:25:30,120
called insignificant, which looks
like it's going to be really good. Um,

349
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,640
they've even made it to Lego land and you
could have a tee shirt with this image

350
00:25:36,441 --> 00:25:38,660
on it. So, uh,

351
00:25:38,661 --> 00:25:43,060
that's Miss Lovett with the magnifying
glass and Ms. Cannon with her stellar

352
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:46,130
classification. And, uh,

353
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,460
Dr. Payne with her,
uh,

354
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,830
primary constituents of the stars.
Uh,

355
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:59,330
this is a work by, uh,
a young artist from La.

356
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,480
My name is Leah Halloran and she
has been looking at the glass place.

357
00:26:05,871 --> 00:26:10,370
There are half a million glass
plates at Harvard, so they are,

358
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:15,580
that's really the glass universe.
Uh, uh, and they have, um,

359
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:19,670
they cover a complete
century northern hemisphere,

360
00:26:19,671 --> 00:26:24,080
southern hemisphere chart plates,
spectral plates,

361
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,820
and uh,

362
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:30,870
so she sees them as artworks and she's
reproducing some of them as works of art.

363
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:32,570
Uh,

364
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:36,980
and these are enormous pieces that are
about six feet square and they're going

365
00:26:36,981 --> 00:26:41,981
to be in an exhibition next spring
called your body is a space that sees,

366
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:46,290
there's still wants to be done at Harvard.

367
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:51,720
So there's a digitization project going
on now for the plates that's funded by

368
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:56,730
national science foundation because the
full information content has never been

369
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,200
mined from these plates.

370
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:06,140
And all from the beginning when the,
um,

371
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:10,720
when they began accumulating
in the observatory, um,

372
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:15,270
people would come to Harvard just to be
able to use them and sometimes Pickering

373
00:27:15,271 --> 00:27:19,260
would actually send the plates out to
people if he thought they were serious

374
00:27:19,261 --> 00:27:21,690
about their work and they took that risk.

375
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,990
So when they're a digitized,

376
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,350
it will be a lot easier for
everybody to look at them.

377
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:33,250
And you won't have to worry about
breaking the fragile plates. Uh,

378
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:34,500
I didn't have any of,
you know,

379
00:27:34,501 --> 00:27:39,501
there was a flood this year at Harvard
and the place that lovely wooden

380
00:27:40,351 --> 00:27:44,550
building, um, the minute the
plates started accumulating,

381
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:49,320
Pickering started agitating for a brick
building, fireproof brick building,

382
00:27:49,321 --> 00:27:51,870
which he got.
And that's where they are today.

383
00:27:51,871 --> 00:27:55,920
They're still in the building that
was specifically built for them,

384
00:27:55,921 --> 00:27:59,190
but nobody counted on a broken water main.

385
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:04,920
And about 60,000 of the plates
got submerged in muddy water,

386
00:28:04,921 --> 00:28:09,210
but
along with the digitization equipment,

387
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:13,410
but everything has been
rebuilt and they are there.

388
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,000
They are growing again.

389
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:19,720
And there's also opportunity for people
who want to help digitize all the log

390
00:28:19,721 --> 00:28:23,220
books.
So there's a Smithsonian,

391
00:28:23,221 --> 00:28:25,620
crowdsourcing a platform.

392
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,130
People are people who are
doing it. Uh, so here they are,

393
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:34,770
uh,
just about everybody's in this picture.

394
00:28:34,771 --> 00:28:39,360
Everybody I've mentioned
except for Ms [inaudible],
she had died by this time. Um,

395
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:44,850
but just, uh, just seems to me in the,

396
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,880
in the light of recent events and the
anti-science bias that maybe you don't

397
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:57,780
feel here at Google, but it's out
there and it's really terrifying.

398
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,090
Um,
so I feel,

399
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:06,030
I feel it behooves all of us to tell
true stories about science and maybe,

400
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:11,810
maybe especially about women in science
because there aren't that many examples

401
00:29:11,941 --> 00:29:15,840
for young women. And, um, this
group was pretty terrific.

402
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:22,180
[inaudible] so,

403
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:27,700
uh, as, as my program, I will steal the
first question. Okay. And my question is,

404
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:29,260
this is a hundred years ago,

405
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:35,560
we have much bigger telescopes now
we have much more people working in

406
00:29:35,561 --> 00:29:36,394
astronomy.

407
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:41,740
Are these plates still being used for
current research or is it more research?

408
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:46,380
They are, it is current big. They
call it time domain astronomy.

409
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:50,310
So things that are discovered now you can,

410
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:55,580
you can access a plate of that exact
part of the sky and look to see what was

411
00:29:56,431 --> 00:30:00,900
there that and that,
that has proven instructive in many cases.

412
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:03,920
So from what you said, it
sounds like there's, um,

413
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:08,600
there's a few things that went into making
it possible to have this, uh, you know,

414
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:11,600
close to gender equality at
this moment in time. Right.

415
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:15,360
There was the economic force of
them being cheaper to hire. Uh,

416
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,410
there was the grants that were available
just to get a woman at that point in

417
00:30:18,411 --> 00:30:23,360
time and maybe even just they didn't have
opportunities elsewhere to find other,

418
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:26,570
other work for, you know, very
intelligent women at that time.

419
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:32,030
And a lot of that started to change,
you know, around like 1940s or so.

420
00:30:32,031 --> 00:30:34,580
Right.
So real computers came in,

421
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:40,130
electronic ones and, uh, other jobs
or women started to become available.

422
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:45,380
So do you know if this was, was there like
an upward or downward trend, you know,

423
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:47,510
uh,
was,

424
00:30:47,511 --> 00:30:52,511
was this a moment in time or was astronomy
still an interesting area for women

425
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:53,930
after that?

426
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:56,080
With the strategy.
It's still an interesting area for women

427
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,850
or an area of equality,
I guess.

428
00:30:58,170 --> 00:30:59,003
Um,

429
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:04,520
well not everybody considers
their opportunity an equal
opportunity at that time

430
00:31:05,941 --> 00:31:09,990
because they were paid less, but it
still was a sensational opportunity.

431
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:15,410
And the fact that they worked at Harvard
and that people knew about it made it

432
00:31:16,921 --> 00:31:21,090
possible for women to go and work at other
observatories where they were allowed

433
00:31:21,091 --> 00:31:25,470
to make observations and
have opportunities I don't
think they would have had

434
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:28,050
without that situation.

435
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:33,240
So one of the other things that went
into it with Pickering's open mindedness

436
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:33,641
and,

437
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:38,641
and willing willingness to entrust
that kind of judgment work to,

438
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:43,410
to the women who worked
for him. Um, there are, uh,

439
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:49,350
I think astronomy is a field where,
where women have a lot of opportunities,

440
00:31:49,351 --> 00:31:53,400
maybe not as many as they would like,
but, but it's, it's, it's pretty good.

441
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:59,010
And at Harvard now, about half the
astronomy graduate students are women. So,

442
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
so you mentioned you had done the original
spoke for this book about 20 years

443
00:32:06,161 --> 00:32:06,461
ago.

444
00:32:06,461 --> 00:32:11,461
Can you tell us about the process of how
you got into actually going after these

445
00:32:11,591 --> 00:32:14,230
archives and developing this project?

446
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:19,270
Oh sure. Oh yeah. That's um, well
it was at the back of my mind.

447
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:24,670
Uh, but I had other things that
I worked on for a long time.

448
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:25,780
Um,

449
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:30,780
I always wondered would it be possible
to even write this book because there

450
00:32:30,941 --> 00:32:35,920
were so many characters. I had
mentioned that. And so I, um,

451
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:38,900
I worried about it, but then, um,

452
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:44,120
the more I learned about them in,
in the early nineties,

453
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:48,140
there was a, um, there was
a special issue of mercury,

454
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:53,090
the magazine of the Astronomical Society
of the Pacific that was just devoted to

455
00:32:53,091 --> 00:32:53,924
women astronomy,

456
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:58,760
women in astronomy and
told some of their stories.

457
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:03,920
And I thought, this is just terrific. I
can't, I can't believe nobody's done this.

458
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,110
And,
um,

459
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:11,300
then there was a book just about Henrietta
Leavitt called Miss Lovett stars by

460
00:33:11,301 --> 00:33:13,700
George Johnson.
And I was,

461
00:33:13,701 --> 00:33:18,320
it felt kind of bad for him because
she was the silent woman of the group.

462
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,690
She didn't write letters,
she didn't keep a diary.

463
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:24,010
And we even have pick a person
to write a biography. She,

464
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,050
she was just the toughest
one. Her, her discovery,

465
00:33:27,051 --> 00:33:30,230
her work was probably
the most important thing,

466
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,730
but he was really stretching,
you know,

467
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:38,260
he wound up giving what her grades
had been at Radcliffe. And I,

468
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:43,010
I didn't, I didn't want to
be in that position, but,

469
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:43,873
um,

470
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:49,990
finally I convinced myself the story was
so good that I would just have to count

471
00:33:50,481 --> 00:33:53,480
on being able to,
to find the material.

472
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:58,850
So I first started at the plate stacks.
So that's what they call the,

473
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:02,030
the huge library of half a million plates.

474
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:07,050
And just looking at them was so exciting,
uh,

475
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:10,160
the way they're written
on. So you, you, you,

476
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,030
there's always something
in a project that makes,

477
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:18,980
makes me understand what really went on.
And you know,

478
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:23,540
the curator will give you what one of
those little magnifying loops and you can

479
00:34:23,541 --> 00:34:28,510
lean over a light table and look
into one of those plates and,

480
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,440
and see the depth of it. And,
uh, then I was really hooked.

481
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,593
Uh,

482
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:40,130
and then I learned
about the diaries and I,

483
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:43,520
I had confidence that I
would be able to do it.

484
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:48,910
So it meant it meant a lot of
being at Harvard because the,

485
00:34:49,011 --> 00:34:49,610
uh,

486
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:54,610
the archive is open only five days a
week and only five hours on those five

487
00:34:56,421 --> 00:35:00,110
days. So this, it was kind of,

488
00:35:00,111 --> 00:35:03,620
I'd be there just before they
open and then I just, I'd be,

489
00:35:03,621 --> 00:35:07,630
I didn't even go to the bathroom.
I mean, I've just, uh, because the,

490
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:12,200
the wealth of material, I mean,
not just the diaries, but the, uh,

491
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:14,300
the observatory correspondence,

492
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:19,780
everything was documented
from the 1870s they made,

493
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:23,840
they made a letter press
copy of every letter,

494
00:35:23,841 --> 00:35:27,560
whether they were designing
a new telescope, uh,

495
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:31,610
ordering new ink, whatever they
were doing. It was documented.

496
00:35:31,611 --> 00:35:34,400
So it was just so much
stuff to go through.

497
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:39,120
And then I had to realize that I wasn't
going to get through it all and I,

498
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:43,140
so that was difficult to just pick,
okay,

499
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,390
I'll read these years of the diaries,

500
00:35:45,391 --> 00:35:49,410
I'll read this person's correspondence.

501
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:54,060
Um, and then I had,
fortunately I had a, uh,

502
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:59,010
a visiting professor, writer in residence
kind of position at Smith College.

503
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:03,180
And so then I was nearby and,
um,

504
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,460
and that made it possible to, and, um,

505
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,460
what else was it like,
um,

506
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:16,140
there was a lot of science that happened
because at the beginning of the story,

507
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:19,970
nobody,
nobody knew the constitution of the stars.

508
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,790
No body knew what made them shine,

509
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:29,430
how far away they were, was really the
only thing that was known was positioned.

510
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,240
So,
and by the end of the story,

511
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:38,400
almost everything was known
at least an outline. So,

512
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:43,260
uh, there was a lot to cover and
I had to learn a lot of astronomy.

513
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:47,250
Um, I mean, this has been the
thing I've written most about, but,

514
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:52,290
uh, it was, it was a stretch and I, uh,

515
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:58,060
had many days of saying whatever
made me think I could do this. Uh,

516
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:02,580
but, um, I'm really pleased with the way
it came out. Did you have a question?

517
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:04,670
Oh, I'm sorry. Did we know

518
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:16,020
there are very few people left
who, who knew the real people? Um,

519
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:19,500
but there are a couple,
uh, some of Cecilia pains,

520
00:37:19,501 --> 00:37:22,620
graduate students are still alive.
Um,

521
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,710
and then if you're interested, the, uh,

522
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:30,730
the American Institute of Physics does
an interview series and so she's one of

523
00:37:30,991 --> 00:37:35,280
the people who's been interviewed for
that series and there's even a little clip

524
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,750
you can hear her voice

525
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:43,190
when did this period.
And so a,

526
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:48,200
the big money infusion
started in 1886 and then,

527
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:53,160
so the women were there and
it went through World War II.

528
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:57,390
During World War II. They
all did more work. Um,

529
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:00,710
Mrs Shapley was working for the navy,
uh,

530
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:03,690
doing ballistics trajectories.
Uh,

531
00:38:03,691 --> 00:38:07,380
there was a lot of ballistics
trajectory work. Um,

532
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:09,210
and then by the end of the war,

533
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:14,460
there were the machine
computers coming in. Um,

534
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:18,750
and, uh, the observatory had less money.

535
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:22,720
Um, but they kept it going till, uh,

536
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:27,300
till the 1950s when, uh, ms pain,

537
00:38:27,301 --> 00:38:29,070
Dr. Payne,
uh,

538
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:34,490
became the first woman promoted to
a tenured professorship at Harvard.

539
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:41,410
Um,
and yeah,

540
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:45,160
I guess that was your question.
Yeah. Through the early 1950s.

541
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,600
Huge Fan. Thank you for
coming. Oh, thank you. Um,

542
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,440
I used to teach with longitude and,
um,

543
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,830
I had to walk my students
through localization, Yada, Yada,

544
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:02,200
and then ending up ultimately with the
solution as a clock, obviously. Um,

545
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:06,520
and I'm always impressed with your
ability to take technology and history and

546
00:39:06,521 --> 00:39:07,354
put it in.

547
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:11,710
We're living on this unbroken chain of
technological innovation and getting

548
00:39:11,711 --> 00:39:12,544
context on it,

549
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:16,900
but the highlight of that was
going to Greenwich and seeing the,

550
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,730
seeing the clocks, um, so that,

551
00:39:19,731 --> 00:39:24,060
that kind of historical tourism was
really remarkable. Okay. Oh yeah.

552
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:28,630
[inaudible] graph to do that. Is there
an analogy for that? For this? Yeah,

553
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,130
I see you didn't see the plates.
It's just that simple.

554
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:36,190
Yeah.
Now and Eric Kapor that,

555
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:41,170
that place has been decommissioned
and the building that housed the Bruce

556
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:45,370
Telescope is a chapel and I'm
kind of curious to see that.

557
00:39:45,371 --> 00:39:49,930
I don't know if I'll get there. Um, they
also had a station in South America,

558
00:39:49,931 --> 00:39:54,400
which is no longer, it's no
longer Harvard. It's still,

559
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:58,810
it's still an astronomy
station, but, um, yeah,

560
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:02,020
like you don't have to go that far. You
could, you could just go to Cambridge,

561
00:40:02,021 --> 00:40:02,854
Massachusetts.

562
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:06,950
Oh, that last question
is, um, what's next?

563
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:11,680
I don't have a next idea. And I, um,

564
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:16,540
I feel I'm not really
finished with the story, um,

565
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,140
that I,

566
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:24,250
I've never seen a life documented
the way Ms. Cannon is document.

567
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,710
I mean,
aside from the diaries,

568
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:31,210
there's every libretto
from every opera she had.

569
00:40:31,211 --> 00:40:34,240
And she was a big opera
fan. She was deaf, but she,

570
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:39,250
she shouted enough hearing
that she loved music. And so,

571
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,560
um, uh, as I said,

572
00:40:41,561 --> 00:40:46,561
I didn't get to read everything and I'm
kind of still in this story and I'm also

573
00:40:47,951 --> 00:40:52,040
struck by how few people know about it.
So I,

574
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:57,390
I put together a committee of about 10
people who agreed to read the manuscript

575
00:40:57,761 --> 00:41:02,470
as technical experts because I didn't
trust myself that I'd really gotten all

576
00:41:02,471 --> 00:41:06,520
the facts straight. Um,
so one of them was a,

577
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:11,230
is a woman who's a full professor
of astronomy at Harvard now.

578
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:16,000
And she of course had
heard about this situation,

579
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:21,250
but she immediately got distracted
from her job as a technical reader.

580
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:25,360
And she said, I didn't realize
they were doing real science.

581
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:30,050
I always thought it was something
just cute or quite, you know, this is,

582
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,620
this is a completely different situation.

583
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:38,510
And she was,
cannon was getting,

584
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:43,560
she won many honorary degrees and awards
and she took one of her awards and

585
00:41:43,851 --> 00:41:46,820
endowed a prize for a
young woman astronomer.

586
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:52,460
And this faculty member had been
put up for that prize and she said,

587
00:41:52,461 --> 00:41:55,310
I don't want it. I don't want any
price. That's just for a woman.

588
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,370
So now knowing the history,
she had a different feeling about it.

589
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:06,710
So I, I think it's, I think this
is too important a story to,

590
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,990
in so many stories get forgotten.
I mean,

591
00:42:08,991 --> 00:42:13,700
how can we remember everybody in history?
But this is a really good story.

592
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:15,103
And,
uh,

593
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:20,140
somebody else came up to me recently
who was a woman in 1981 Harvard graduate

594
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,290
who was one of the first in
the women's studies program.

595
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:26,150
Never heard of these women.

596
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:29,123
So,

597
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,300
so I, I don't know, I
think I want to go be

598
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,040
an advisor or,

599
00:42:35,041 --> 00:42:40,041
or a Kibitzer to the people who were
doing the new plays and the web series.

600
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:41,780
I think that'd be fun.

601
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,410
I wanted to go back to longitude
if you don't mind. The first one,

602
00:42:47,411 --> 00:42:49,910
it was the first one is
your books that I read. Um,

603
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:54,280
I have the illustrated version and I'll
never forget flipping through the plates

604
00:42:54,281 --> 00:42:58,360
in the middle where there's a picture
of John Harrison's first chronometer,

605
00:42:58,390 --> 00:43:00,400
which looks like a
space alien contraption.

606
00:43:00,401 --> 00:43:02,650
And then you flip the page
and there's two and three,

607
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:05,380
which also looked like
space healing contraptions.

608
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,600
And then you flip the page
again and there's four,

609
00:43:07,601 --> 00:43:09,940
which suddenly looks like a modern clock.
Yeah.

610
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:15,390
A question I came away from the book
was what happened to John Harrison in

611
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:20,140
between three and four that
led him suddenly come out
with something that looked

612
00:43:20,141 --> 00:43:23,110
like it looked like something that
might be up there for us today.

613
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,760
Oh, it wasn't certain
if you remember it. Uh,

614
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:30,570
it took about 20 years.
That was one thing.

615
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:36,500
And uh, a couple of important things. Uh,

616
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:37,583
he had,

617
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:42,800
he got somebody to make him a pocket
watch just for his personal use and was

618
00:43:44,491 --> 00:43:46,860
able to put in one of his innovations,

619
00:43:46,861 --> 00:43:51,861
the temperature compensation and that
convinced him that it would be possible to

620
00:43:52,831 --> 00:43:53,620
build something.

621
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:58,050
We had been making these very
large instruments because large,

622
00:43:58,051 --> 00:43:59,700
same synonymous with accurate.

623
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:05,460
And when did you realize that it was
possible to make it accurate and small?

624
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:10,820
Then he was willing to sacrifice some of
the other parts and went back to an old

625
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:15,981
fashioned a escapement and put the
whole thing in a small package.

626
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,153
Okay.

627
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:26,030
So in the course of
your work on this book,

628
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:29,300
what were some of the things that
most surprised or delighted you?

629
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:34,050
Um, I think surprising was the
graduate education situation.

630
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:37,530
I hadn't realized that and I,
even when I,

631
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:43,020
I was at least a year, maybe two years
into the project before I thought,

632
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:47,970
well, the graduate
students are women. Um, uh,

633
00:44:47,971 --> 00:44:50,340
so that was interesting.
Then I had,

634
00:44:50,341 --> 00:44:54,680
I had one of those weird moments,
uh,

635
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:56,820
uh,
Priscilla Fairfield,

636
00:44:56,821 --> 00:45:01,821
who was a Smith professor and got involved
in the Harvard work and she would go

637
00:45:02,221 --> 00:45:05,310
there. She would spend the
whole summer working at Harvard.

638
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:10,880
So she was constantly corresponding with
Shapley about their projects together

639
00:45:11,011 --> 00:45:12,330
and what was the next thing to do.

640
00:45:12,331 --> 00:45:17,040
And she always wrote to him on Smith
College observatory stationary.

641
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:23,270
And one day she wrote to him while she
was working at home and she put her home

642
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:27,270
address and it was the building
I was living in at Smith College.

643
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:31,050
Not if it wasn't on the college campus,
it was just in the town.

644
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:35,850
And so, uh, that was a big surprise. Um,

645
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,770
uh,
uh,

646
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:46,870
what else? Um, uh, just the,

647
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:51,930
the acceptance of them because I had
heard the term Pickering's Harem and I had

648
00:45:52,391 --> 00:45:56,680
heard, uh, all the flap about
how little they were paid.

649
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:01,920
So I wasn't expecting the kind
of recognition that they got,

650
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:05,410
you know, especially the, the foreign,

651
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:10,520
the Royal Astronomical Society.
No,

652
00:46:10,521 --> 00:46:14,090
both Mrs. Fleming and Ms.
Cannon were foreign members.

653
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:19,580
That was remarkable. Um, and then the, um,

654
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,190
the collegial nature of astronomy,

655
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:27,430
I think it is always been an international
science because you have to have

656
00:46:28,281 --> 00:46:32,210
people all over the place to,
to get hold of it.

657
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:33,583
Uh,

658
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:38,830
but Harvard really became a hub and people
would come from Europe and work there

659
00:46:38,931 --> 00:46:41,890
for weeks, months at a time. Uh,

660
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:44,300
and then they were all
corresponding with each other.

661
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,550
And even during World War One,

662
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:52,060
Pickering was so reluctant to break off
relations with anybody in astronomy and

663
00:46:54,681 --> 00:46:56,510
immediately at the end of the war,

664
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:01,840
and he couldn't wait to get in touch with
the German observers and how were they

665
00:47:01,971 --> 00:47:05,880
doing and what had happened to
their observatories and how,

666
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:11,240
how it was drawn. Immersion really
rally and in all cooperate again.

667
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:16,550
So that those were all kinds of feel good,
feel good things.

668
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:19,610
It's a happy story for the most part.

669
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:24,843
Okay.

670
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:30,010
Any other questions? You Ready?
Alright. So that, thank you very

671
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:30,760
much.
Thank you.
