1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,110
So I'm, I'm really pleased
to introduce Dr John Barge.

2
00:00:09,111 --> 00:00:11,720
He's a professor of
psychology at Yale University.

3
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:16,670
He's been doing research in this field
for over 25 years, much longer than that.

4
00:00:16,671 --> 00:00:18,590
Even with a focus on the unconscious.

5
00:00:18,591 --> 00:00:22,220
He's distilled key findings from his
research in the field in general into the

6
00:00:22,221 --> 00:00:25,790
book that he's here to talk about today.
Before you know it,

7
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:30,770
the unconscious reasons we do what we do,
please join me in giving him,

8
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,210
giving him a warm welcome.

9
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:35,970
[inaudible]

10
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,090
thank you David.
Thank you all for coming.

11
00:00:38,091 --> 00:00:41,540
I know you have an option
during your lunch. Don't
shower, don't have to be here.

12
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,460
So I appreciate it.
Um,

13
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:48,970
so the book is not about
the Freudian unconscious.

14
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:54,550
It's a about the last 30 or 40 years of
actual systematic scientific research on

15
00:00:54,651 --> 00:00:59,330
average normal people randomly
assigned to conditions, uh, not,

16
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,390
uh, uh, case studies of
mentally ill people, uh,

17
00:01:02,391 --> 00:01:07,280
from which a Freud generate and generated
a, it's an entire theory. Uh, it's also,

18
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:11,120
um, we'll see the talk is
sort of structured this way,
but it's only a 30 minutes.

19
00:01:11,121 --> 00:01:12,590
And I'm actually,
if you'd like,

20
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:17,300
I'll try to speed it up and
make it shorter than that.
Uh, it's also not a, um,

21
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:22,250
uh, what we found is that logically
you probably would figure this out.

22
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:26,300
It's not a separate mind. Unconscious is
not some kind of separate part of the,

23
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,920
of the brain with its own rules and with
its own operating system on, on, uh,

24
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,310
and it's locked away and you can't see it.
You probably,

25
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:36,650
you remember that movie inside out with
the little emotions running a control

26
00:01:36,651 --> 00:01:40,130
room, that animation movie, one of the
little emotions did something wrong.

27
00:01:40,131 --> 00:01:42,800
It got thrown into this unconscious
cave and the door was locked.

28
00:01:42,801 --> 00:01:45,500
He never saw them again.
I never heard from them again.

29
00:01:45,501 --> 00:01:47,240
And that's not what we're talking about.
It's a,

30
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:51,590
it's a very different kind of thing.
It's, it's one, uh, brain, uh,

31
00:01:51,591 --> 00:01:56,591
the research showing a affects of
increasing or decreasing incentives during

32
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,620
tasks. This is out of university college.
London, uh, shows at the same brain.

33
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:03,440
Regions are, are, are
used, uh, become active.

34
00:02:03,441 --> 00:02:06,240
In either case when a
motivational state as a,

35
00:02:06,241 --> 00:02:08,000
a conscious one or it's
an unconscious one,

36
00:02:08,001 --> 00:02:11,420
it's the same brain region and that's
pretty much true of everything.

37
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,790
Whatever the kind of a thing
you're looking at, emotion,
motivation, a language,

38
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:17,361
behavior.

39
00:02:17,361 --> 00:02:21,470
It's the same part of the brain that's
operating and whether it's in conscious

40
00:02:21,471 --> 00:02:23,840
or unconscious mode,
but it's a single unified brain.

41
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,820
It's basically I help the unconscious.

42
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,210
Unconscious influences are generally
helpful. They survived natural selection,

43
00:02:29,211 --> 00:02:32,030
they survived evolution. They're
not some kind of destructive, evil,

44
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,280
evil twin lurking inside your skull.

45
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:38,030
So that's the difference between what
a lot of people here and the word

46
00:02:38,031 --> 00:02:41,480
unconscious. And that's what they,
they think of. Of course. Well,

47
00:02:41,481 --> 00:02:44,720
there's a disconnect though and
this is why, uh, I'm organizing, uh,

48
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,170
organize the book but also organize
this talk today in terms of the past,

49
00:02:48,171 --> 00:02:51,710
present, and future, because we're
focused almost always on the present.

50
00:02:51,711 --> 00:02:53,990
We're focused on what's around,
what's going on in front of us,

51
00:02:53,991 --> 00:02:56,660
what we are aware of, right?
What else could we be aware of,

52
00:02:56,661 --> 00:03:00,010
but what we're aware of. And so we
understand the reasons for how we feel.

53
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:03,730
And our decisions and and so forth based
on what's available to us right now in

54
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:07,780
front of us, the mind is on all
three times zones at the same time.

55
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,080
You could influence this from the
evolutionary past, very strong ones.

56
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:12,790
You've got influences
from your early childhood.

57
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,610
You have no memory for any more from your
first three or four years of life that

58
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:18,940
carry over the rest of your life.
Influences of your recent past,

59
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:22,400
which just happened. The carryover,
like for my case for a long time,

60
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:26,080
my work life would just segue right
into my home life and carry over to my

61
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:29,500
understanding of what was going
on at home, which was wrong. Uh,

62
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:33,250
but also your future, your motivations,
your goals, your aspirations,

63
00:03:33,251 --> 00:03:36,850
things you're trying to attain, whether
it's a longterm life goal, have a family,

64
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:41,500
have a successful career, be happy,
uh, that kind of thing. Or even just,

65
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,700
I got to get something done tomorrow.
Your mind is often in the future. Uh, and,

66
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:49,180
and your goals and motives influenced
how you see the present. In other words,

67
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,700
what's good for your goal?
It's what's good for you.

68
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,390
And you like and dislike things as a
function of whether they're good for your

69
00:03:55,391 --> 00:03:56,224
current goal,

70
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:00,460
which can be a disconnect from your
longterm values and your longterm beliefs.

71
00:04:00,461 --> 00:04:01,810
And I'll show you some examples of that.

72
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,990
So that's how it's organized
and we'll jump right in, um,

73
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,440
to the distant past of evolutionary
past and these basic needs,

74
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:13,030
uh, these, these very important, uh,

75
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:18,040
needs that we have and motivations that
we have. So basic to be safe, to survive,

76
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:21,370
not to die, to avoid
disease, to avoid germs,

77
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,530
protect ourselves against disease. Uh, and
of course, reproduction and mating, sex,

78
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:31,180
uh, and cooperation. And these are, these
are the basic ones, but they're, you know,

79
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:35,560
they're the basic physical motivations
that we have. And yet, as you'll see,

80
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,360
they're influencing a lot more than that.
So for example,

81
00:04:40,361 --> 00:04:42,550
this is topical because this is October.

82
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,780
It seems like every October
we're told to get out, you know,

83
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:45,850
go out and get a flu shot.

84
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:49,620
There's this horrible new strain of flu
virus out there. Uh, that's a killer and,

85
00:04:49,621 --> 00:04:54,490
and very dangerous. Can't read this very
well. I'll tell you the, the study though,

86
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,560
there's a metaphor is being used in our
country and it's actually a metaphor

87
00:04:59,561 --> 00:05:04,330
that's been used in the past by arch
conservative leaders in the past that is

88
00:05:04,331 --> 00:05:08,050
tapping into this very strong motivation
that we have without realizing it.

89
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:13,510
That immigrants into a country are like
viruses into a body like germs into a

90
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,850
physical body or bacteria into a body.

91
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:20,170
And we need to protect ourselves and
be safe from these germs and bacteria.

92
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,920
We have to expel them and get rid of
them if they're in our body already.

93
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,980
We have to build walls or build
structures to keep them out,

94
00:05:26,981 --> 00:05:31,000
protect ourselves from the invasion of
these germs and bacteria into our Bobby.

95
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,110
And so if you think about, uh, uh,
immigrant immigration that way, there's a,

96
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:41,050
you can see there's a strong connection
between the metaphor or analogy of

97
00:05:41,051 --> 00:05:45,160
immigration into a country and germs
or bacteria or viruses into a body.

98
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,450
Not said explicitly,
although people,

99
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:52,270
arch conservative leaders in the past
have said that explicitly about despised

100
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:55,770
minority groups in their
society. Uh, and it,

101
00:05:55,771 --> 00:06:00,590
it was an excuse or justification for
eradication of those groups. Well,

102
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:04,190
what do we do this time of year?
A few years ago,

103
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:07,850
we reminded the people in our study of
the flu virus and the threat of the flu.

104
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:13,070
And then we had them complete a attitude
survey about immigration attitudes

105
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:16,010
towards immigration.
After that,

106
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:18,770
we asked them after they'd
already completed that survey,

107
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,260
whether they'd had a flu shot or not.

108
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:25,670
So the people who we raised this threat
but already knew they had a flu shot,

109
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,220
felt safe because here's the threat.

110
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,040
But they've already taken steps
to protect themselves against it.

111
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,750
They should feel safe from the flu virus.

112
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,950
It turns out they had more positive than
average attitudes towards immigration

113
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,140
because we raised the fruit,
the flu threat.

114
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,280
But for the people we raised the flu
threat too, but had not had the flu shot.

115
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:46,430
Their attitudes towards immigration
became significantly more negative.

116
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,400
They were more against immigration
compared to a control group.

117
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:54,140
So we're moving around their attitudes
towards immigration by raising and

118
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,580
lowering the threat of the
flu virus, which is that
connection I'm talking about.

119
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:04,850
And there's more, there's a longstanding
lot of research, uh, showing that,

120
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,580
um, conservative, uh, uh,

121
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,210
people with conservative ideologies are
conservative attitudes are generally

122
00:07:11,211 --> 00:07:15,050
more concerned with physical
threat and physical safety.

123
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:18,680
Then other people are a lot of
research on that. For example,

124
00:07:18,681 --> 00:07:20,600
the size of the human,
the Amygdala,

125
00:07:20,601 --> 00:07:25,460
which is the part of the brain that
reacts to fear and, and strong emotions.

126
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:28,250
It's actually larger and
conservatives than in liberals.

127
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:32,270
Brain imaging studies have shown that
four year olds who are more fearful tend

128
00:07:32,271 --> 00:07:36,590
to have more conservative attitudes
at age 23 as a study out of Berkeley.

129
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:41,660
So there's lots of studies on
this and in general, given this,

130
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:46,730
there's been a easy trick that a political
psychologist have used in the past

131
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:51,200
that you can turn a liberal
into a conservative basically
by threatening them,

132
00:07:51,201 --> 00:07:54,350
making them feel afraid. They then
have more conservative attitudes.

133
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,870
And remember Franklin
Delano Roosevelt saying,

134
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,970
we have nothing to fear but fear itself.

135
00:07:58,971 --> 00:08:03,971
And former president Obama talks a lot
these days about against the politics of

136
00:08:04,011 --> 00:08:06,890
fear because fear makes
people more conservative.

137
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,990
Well,
people have always turned,

138
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,890
have been very successful at turning
liberals and the conservatives,

139
00:08:12,891 --> 00:08:15,560
but no one has ever turn a
conservative into a liberal.

140
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,980
And so we did that by,

141
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:23,210
as you probably could figure out
how having him feel physically safe.

142
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:27,240
We had them imagine that they were given
a super power by a genie and they was a

143
00:08:27,241 --> 00:08:28,850
rich imagination exercise.

144
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:32,960
And they really are trying to really
imagine this happening in the control

145
00:08:32,961 --> 00:08:35,660
condition. The super power they
were given was to be able to fly.

146
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,320
That's actually the most
popular superpower people
want of all the ones that are

147
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:44,110
possible. That's a control
condition. The others were, uh,

148
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,270
given the superpower of being
invulnerable from FIS to physical harm,

149
00:08:47,271 --> 00:08:50,120
like superman bullets would bounce off
you if you fell. Nothing would happen.

150
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,480
Nothing would cut you. Those kinds
of things. And they imagined that.

151
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:59,730
And then we looked at their attitudes on
standard social issues that classically

152
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:04,440
define and divide conservatives
and liberals, like same
sex marriage, marijuana,

153
00:09:04,441 --> 00:09:06,090
legalization and so forth.

154
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,630
The ones that are the standard ones where
you got the difference and you see on

155
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:12,000
the left the flying condition,
you get the standard difference.

156
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:13,650
Conservatives are more
conservative than liberal,

157
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,500
but the fly thing didn't
matter at all as a superpower,

158
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,400
but the people who were made
to feel and vulnerable to harm,

159
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,290
the Conservatives move much more,

160
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:26,670
much more close to liberal attitudes
as a result of feeling physically safe

161
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:27,803
temporarily.

162
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:32,400
Another study on the actual defining
quality of being conservative,

163
00:09:32,401 --> 00:09:35,130
which is resistance to social change.
That's what the,

164
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,260
that's what FDR was talking about in that
speech about fear and fear itself was

165
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,220
talking about the new deal
that wasn't about World War II.

166
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:46,170
That was 1933 his first state of the
Union address during the depression

167
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,720
on that issue, you actually
cause conservatives in
the roads to be identical.

168
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:53,161
If anything,

169
00:09:53,161 --> 00:09:55,830
then you've taken conservatives and
turned them into liberals by at least

170
00:09:55,831 --> 00:09:58,740
temporarily making them feel
totally physically safe.

171
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,240
Just like you can take liberals,

172
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,690
make them more conservative in their
attitudes by making them feel afraid.

173
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:09,800
So these deep underlying evolved needs
bubble up to influence, you know,

174
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,810
abstract social attitudes and political
attitudes that you think are just the

175
00:10:12,811 --> 00:10:15,000
product of reasoning and
some reason position.

176
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:18,900
But you can raise or lower
those conservative liberal
attitudes on the top of

177
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:20,740
the boiling water bite.
Uh,

178
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,270
the underlying flame underneath of feeling
physically safe or feeling physically

179
00:10:24,271 --> 00:10:28,360
afraid. Another one has been
a lot of research on this one.

180
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:32,380
Physical warmth and coldness
over the last 10 years or so.

181
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:36,460
We did a study 10 years ago in science
published in science where essentially we

182
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:40,240
gave everybody the same at uh,
at Yale and other places,

183
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,070
the same description of a person to read.

184
00:10:42,071 --> 00:10:44,500
And they formed an impression of
whether they liked the person or not.

185
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,990
We gave everybody the same one,

186
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,470
but for some of them while
they were coming into the
experiment, actually in the,

187
00:10:50,471 --> 00:10:53,200
in the elevator coming up to lab,
we had a lot of papers,

188
00:10:53,201 --> 00:10:53,921
like the question they were,

189
00:10:53,921 --> 00:10:57,400
they were supposed to fill out and we had
in our hand, oh here we even have one,

190
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:03,010
uh, a couple of either ice coffee or, or,
or hot coffee, iced coffee or warm coffee.

191
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,990
This is the ice coffee condition.

192
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,240
Okay.

193
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,160
We said, could you hold that
for me for a second, you know,

194
00:11:09,161 --> 00:11:11,840
so I can get your papers for you.
And they hold it and open it,

195
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,540
throws the papers and
he took it right back.

196
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:14,990
So it was a matter of
two or three seconds.

197
00:11:14,991 --> 00:11:17,710
They might've held but warm
or the hot or the ice coffee.

198
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,800
If they held a warm coffee,

199
00:11:20,801 --> 00:11:23,440
they formed a significantly more positive
impression of the person they read

200
00:11:23,441 --> 00:11:23,711
about.

201
00:11:23,711 --> 00:11:27,880
If they had held the ice
coffee significantly more
negative impression of the

202
00:11:27,881 --> 00:11:30,460
person they read about number.
Everybody read the about the same person.

203
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:35,470
So feeling physically warm or cold
actually changed it or feeling of a person

204
00:11:35,471 --> 00:11:39,940
being socially warm or socially
cold. And since then, last 10 years,

205
00:11:39,941 --> 00:11:43,450
it's been a lot of neuroscience on this,
mainly at Ucla

206
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,500
where they show the same little
part of the human insula,

207
00:11:47,501 --> 00:11:50,200
which is a walnut shaped part of the
brain and the middle of the brain.

208
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,060
The same little part becomes when you
hold something warm and when you're

209
00:11:55,061 --> 00:11:58,420
texting your family and friends and when
you're thinking about the people close

210
00:11:58,421 --> 00:11:59,170
to you.

211
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:02,920
And also the same little part becomes
active when you hold something cold and

212
00:12:02,921 --> 00:12:05,200
when you're thinking about people
who had betrayed you, who are,

213
00:12:05,201 --> 00:12:08,980
who are your enemies? They're
connected, they're wired together.

214
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:14,070
There's a channel between feeling
physical warmth and feeling trust and,

215
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,270
and the positive things
towards other people.

216
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:20,920
And the same kind of channel conversely
with, with feeling of physically cold,

217
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,750
get back to that in a second.

218
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,670
Much more other research has been
showing that a person's actual body

219
00:12:27,671 --> 00:12:32,170
temperature goes up and down along with
their feelings of how closely feel to

220
00:12:32,171 --> 00:12:34,870
their family and friends.
So people are in the hospital,

221
00:12:34,871 --> 00:12:38,560
their temperatures taken oral temperature
every six, every hour for six hours.

222
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:43,180
And they also asked them how closely
feel to the close ones in their life.

223
00:12:43,181 --> 00:12:45,430
And it tracks their body temperature,

224
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:49,660
raises and lowers when people are rejected
in some way and a little game when

225
00:12:49,661 --> 00:12:51,820
people don't throw the ball to you
anymore and some computer game,

226
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,820
the avatars are tossing the ball around,
but they stopped throwing it to you.

227
00:12:54,821 --> 00:12:56,200
You feel a little rejected.
Your,

228
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,800
your body temperature actually decreases
about 0.4 Fahrenheit of a degree.

229
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,940
You're actually feeling physical.

230
00:13:01,941 --> 00:13:05,050
Your body is actually physically
colder after socially cold experience.

231
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,400
There was another kind of past,

232
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,630
maybe even more opaque to us because the
things that happened to us in the first

233
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:17,170
three, four years of life, we
don't have much memory for.

234
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:20,860
A lot of things happened to
us back then as as infants.

235
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:26,650
This is my daughter who's a now
11, but when she was, uh, one, two,

236
00:13:26,651 --> 00:13:27,311
three years old,

237
00:13:27,311 --> 00:13:31,510
she was a huge fan of the movie cars
and she loved lightning McQueen and she

238
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:32,410
drove around the house,

239
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,440
a little lightening cars that in a
lightning chair had a lightning blanket.

240
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:39,490
And we watched that movie
together 50 or 60 times,

241
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,680
at least 50 or 60 times.

242
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,440
She was obsessed with lightening
McQueen thought lightening,

243
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,360
lightening McQueen live nearby in Durham,

244
00:13:46,361 --> 00:13:49,570
Connecticut cause she's a red
corvette and you know, in that town,

245
00:13:49,571 --> 00:13:50,860
Nixon next door we lived.

246
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:56,020
Well then she became five and a one
night she wanted to watch a movie.

247
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,200
And I said, okay, Whoa, Whoa,
why don't we watch cars?

248
00:13:59,201 --> 00:14:03,220
We haven't seen that for a while, several
years, you know, and, and uh, that was,

249
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,140
you know, you love that movie.
It was your favorite movie.

250
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:08,890
And she looked at me like I was nuts.
Like, no, I've never heard of that movie.

251
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:13,960
I'd never seen it before. And she really
had no memory of ever seeing it before.

252
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,891
And she's telling me this,

253
00:14:14,891 --> 00:14:18,760
sitting in that same lightning McQueen
chair that she's never heard of this

254
00:14:18,761 --> 00:14:20,650
movie.
And we watched it and she really was like,

255
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:23,950
she was watching it for the first time.
It was like a surprise at all.

256
00:14:23,951 --> 00:14:26,280
The plot twist. She was laughing
at the right places. But as this,

257
00:14:26,281 --> 00:14:29,800
she'd never seen the movie before and
she thought I was crazy cause I had said

258
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:33,310
that she has just no memory at all
of those years of her life. Well,

259
00:14:33,311 --> 00:14:34,210
why is that important?

260
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:38,860
Because there's a lot of things that do
happen early in our life that do matter

261
00:14:38,861 --> 00:14:42,220
to the rest of our life and we have
no idea that they're influencing us.

262
00:14:42,221 --> 00:14:43,930
And for one thing,

263
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:48,490
a research out of Minnesota has tracked
these people who are now in their

264
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,980
twenties. But, uh, when
they were one year old,

265
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,980
they came into the lab with
their mother and they, uh,

266
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,760
took what's called the strange test.

267
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:59,020
The strange test is a way to measure
how it taps the child is to the,

268
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:01,610
to the parent. And usually back in
the day it was always the mother.

269
00:15:01,611 --> 00:15:06,490
But now it's both parents and their
kids, you know who are attached.

270
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,620
Mother leaves the room and they're
like not bothered because they know if

271
00:15:08,621 --> 00:15:10,150
there's any problem other
we'll be right back.

272
00:15:10,151 --> 00:15:13,690
They can count on that mother has their
back, but others they don't know that.

273
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:16,510
And so when the mother leaves
our are a mess, their cry there,

274
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:20,020
there's sterically because they know the
mother may not be coming back very soon

275
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,390
or may not come in if they're
yelling and crying for them.

276
00:15:22,391 --> 00:15:24,880
So they can't trust that.
So it was a matter of bonding and trust.

277
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,710
Is it there at age one or not?

278
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:31,570
Then they look at these people age six,
seven in elementary school,

279
00:15:31,571 --> 00:15:34,900
high school, then in their twenties,
if they're securely attached to,

280
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:37,810
they have more friends in
grade school, they have, uh,

281
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:41,830
they're happier and do better grades in
high school and they have relationships

282
00:15:41,831 --> 00:15:44,110
that do not break up very
often in their twenties.

283
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:48,520
The opposite is true of the people who
have insecure relationships at age one

284
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:51,610
with their mother. So something
is happening early in your life.

285
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,700
It's affecting your relationships
with people. Can you trust people?

286
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,720
Do you break up with them easily
or not the rest of your life?

287
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,990
And they're tracking these people now
they will continue to track them as they

288
00:16:01,991 --> 00:16:02,824
go through their life.

289
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:06,520
But that's totally opaque to you because
you have no memory of any of that.

290
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,260
Yeah.

291
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:12,460
There's things that happened
in the present to go beyond
what's really out there.

292
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,000
Uh, for example, we really think
we know people from their face.

293
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:19,240
We really think that their
faces, diagnostics, somehow
we really know that person.

294
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:24,430
No grumpy cat, right? It's a cat.
It's a cat hats. Really Grumpy, right?

295
00:16:24,431 --> 00:16:27,780
I mean, it's not grumpy. It looks grumpy.
You think it's grumpy now it's a cat.

296
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:30,580
It's that really grumpy
boy. It looks grumpy, right?

297
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,880
And that's old man Marley from home alone.
You know, probably before your time,

298
00:16:33,881 --> 00:16:36,260
but this is the 1990s
movie, right? Old Man.

299
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:40,530
Marlene was like an ax murderer and the
base bodies in the basement next door

300
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,100
according to the kids in the neighborhood,

301
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:43,930
but turned out to be the sweet old guy.

302
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,690
There's that scene at the end of the
Christmas and he reunites with his

303
00:16:46,691 --> 00:16:50,320
granddaughter and it's all wonderful,
but he's a sweet guy. He is, looks like,

304
00:16:50,321 --> 00:16:51,730
you know,
some ax murderer.

305
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,080
But we really feel so sure of
ourselves when we see a person's face.

306
00:16:56,081 --> 00:17:00,460
Like we really know the personality. Turns
out that's not diagnostic. People are,

307
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:02,540
uh, elected, uh, uh, as,

308
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:05,500
as senators and governors who
have the most trustworthy pace,

309
00:17:05,501 --> 00:17:07,630
people rate those faces
not knowing who they are.

310
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:10,630
And it turns out the one that was rated
Morse trustworthy and competent tends to

311
00:17:10,631 --> 00:17:13,000
win these elections 70% of the time.

312
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,700
So certainly the people
voting are thinking,

313
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,770
they know this person's
competent are trustworthy,

314
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,050
and the face by itself is not diagnostic.

315
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:24,220
What is diagnostic is the person
in action. If you see a person,

316
00:17:24,221 --> 00:17:27,340
even for 15 seconds,
30 seconds interacting with other people,

317
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:32,260
that does predict very well. Um, their
outcomes. Are they good therapists?

318
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:36,370
Are they good teacher? Are they a
good whatever, but not photographs?

319
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:40,000
And not just seeing a person for the
first time without any kind of interaction

320
00:17:40,001 --> 00:17:41,080
or seeing them in action at all.

321
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:42,980
Yeah.

322
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:47,600
Here's another way we go beyond that. We
have hurts of antelopes schools of fish,

323
00:17:47,601 --> 00:17:50,160
Fox of bird, all doing the same
thing. Same time. You know,

324
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,950
Fred bird is not looking around
seeing Susie bird go one way and say,

325
00:17:52,951 --> 00:17:54,300
I think I'll do the same thing.
It's not,

326
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,890
it's not a matter of
making decisions here.

327
00:17:55,891 --> 00:18:00,410
It's just an automatic kind of response
to do the same thing as the conspecifics

328
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:04,980
around you. Um, and cats,
I'm not so sure. I mean,

329
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,630
this needs to be replicated.
Um, but we do, people do,

330
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,980
people definitely do this. Little kids
really imitate, especially around age two,

331
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,760
age three, they're learning what
it is right to do. They don't know.

332
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,850
And so they're really watching everybody
to see and they'll do what you're doing

333
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:22,920
and they'll do it over
and over and over again.

334
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:24,703
Okay.

335
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,710
So we studied this and show them that
effecting the lab with college students,

336
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:30,870
a physical behaviors like holding
your ear, protecting your ear or,

337
00:18:30,871 --> 00:18:32,390
or shaking your foot,
that kind of thing.

338
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,020
You're more likely to do it when you're
with a person doing the same thing and

339
00:18:36,021 --> 00:18:37,260
you've switched people and you do with,

340
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,940
so it's like a chameleon changing
the spots to match the environment,

341
00:18:40,941 --> 00:18:45,020
the social environment they're in.
Okay. But this has consequences.

342
00:18:45,021 --> 00:18:47,900
This is a Dutch field study
showing that anti social behavior,

343
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:50,310
mild littering graffiti,
uh,

344
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:55,580
taking a shopping cart three blocks to
your car instead of not leaving it in the

345
00:18:55,581 --> 00:18:56,390
parking lot.

346
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:00,470
Those kinds of mild anti social behaviors
are contagious in that in an area that

347
00:19:00,471 --> 00:19:01,490
has no graffiti,

348
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:05,060
these leaflets that are put on the
handlebars of the bike by rubber bands are

349
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:07,130
not littered as much as
they are on the right.

350
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,290
They put these on and if there's
graffiti in that kind of thing,

351
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:13,020
there's much more littering throwing them
on the ground instead of throwing them

352
00:19:13,021 --> 00:19:16,020
away. Uh, and the various demonstrations,

353
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:20,730
this paper came out in science about 10
years ago. Their social network analysis,

354
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:24,570
uh, Nick Christakis and Jim
Fowler, uh, looking at, uh,

355
00:19:24,571 --> 00:19:28,410
social networks like alumni
associations or, or work groups, um,

356
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,850
uh, credit union members, this
kind of thing. And in that network,

357
00:19:32,851 --> 00:19:37,230
who knows who things like
obesity, depression, cooperation,

358
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:40,950
happiness and other things spread
so that if there's a person,

359
00:19:40,951 --> 00:19:44,700
two or three people removed from you,
but, and you don't even know them,

360
00:19:44,701 --> 00:19:46,710
but they know somebody you know,
and that kind of thing,

361
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,530
you're much more likely to have the
same characteristics as they are.

362
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,340
So things like that spread
behavior spreads, mood spread,

363
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,860
a behavior types like cooperation spread,

364
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:58,203
that's contagion.

365
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,260
The [inaudible] probably
heard of this one, the,

366
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:06,070
the Facebook study from 2014 we're
700,000 users have their newsfeed

367
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:11,270
deliberately manipulate it
as an experiment to be 20%
more positive or 20% more

368
00:20:11,271 --> 00:20:12,590
negative than usual.

369
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:17,090
And then they look to see that that
user's own posts three up to three or four

370
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:20,360
days later to see if they were also
more positive or more negative.

371
00:20:20,361 --> 00:20:23,270
And they were so the
manipulate the newsfeed,

372
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:27,620
it actually caused the person themselves
to have more positive or more negative

373
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:31,120
mood in their posts.
That's another kind of,

374
00:20:31,121 --> 00:20:33,520
obviously social network
could get this kind of spread.

375
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:37,780
What you see is what you do. Uh,
unfortunately is used by advertisers.

376
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,050
This is a epidemiological study
coming out of northeastern university,

377
00:20:41,051 --> 00:20:45,760
just published last year about
1000, uh, underage drinkers,

378
00:20:45,761 --> 00:20:49,930
13 to 19 years.
The more alcohol ads they watched on TV,

379
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,880
the more they drank. You see these
a lot, parents, uh, often, uh,

380
00:20:54,881 --> 00:20:58,240
watch NFL football games or other
sporting events. You see beer ads,

381
00:20:58,241 --> 00:21:00,760
you see a captain Morgan,
you see alcohol adds a lot.

382
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:04,000
The more of these ads the kids were
exposed to, the more of they drank.

383
00:21:04,001 --> 00:21:07,960
And this goes from an average of 10
drinks a month to 30 drinks a month for

384
00:21:07,961 --> 00:21:12,070
those who watched a lot of ads.
This is a direct effect of the ad content.

385
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:15,980
We've done studies just looking at five
minute comedy clips, uh, the old, uh,

386
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:19,150
show whose line is it anyway
with drew Carey, we have a,

387
00:21:19,151 --> 00:21:23,110
a food add in there in the, in the break
or a non food add in there. In the break,

388
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:27,190
we have a bowl of goldfish crackers next
to him and the people who saw the food

389
00:21:27,191 --> 00:21:28,960
ad,
it wasn't even about that kind of food.

390
00:21:28,961 --> 00:21:31,120
Eight 45% more of the goldfish crackers.

391
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:36,520
The food ads are trying to get you to
eat at home when you're watching TV so

392
00:21:36,521 --> 00:21:39,280
that you'll eat more than and have to
buy more the next day at the store.

393
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:41,130
They're trying to get
you to consume more here.

394
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,780
They're trying to get you to drink
more or at least that is the outcome.

395
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,480
Whether or not they are
deliberately trying to do that.

396
00:21:46,481 --> 00:21:48,850
And the effect happens
to teenage drinkers too.

397
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:53,830
Nice thing about this mimicry is
that it actually causes bonding,

398
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:57,910
liking and a feeling of the interaction
went more smoothly. Um, you know,

399
00:21:57,911 --> 00:22:00,250
we have these things where people
do the same thing at the same time.

400
00:22:00,251 --> 00:22:04,360
And in our culture, religious
rituals where you stand,
you kneel, you sing hymns,

401
00:22:04,361 --> 00:22:07,510
you all do it at the same time.
Military, you w you march in step,

402
00:22:07,511 --> 00:22:09,610
you say things together in unison.

403
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:13,960
This actually does produce greater
bonding and liking for the group.

404
00:22:13,961 --> 00:22:17,040
And the group effort. These are
fields studies. This is Dutch,

405
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:19,330
a restaurant and the waitress,
all the,

406
00:22:19,331 --> 00:22:22,210
all the waitress or waiter did
in this study was to repeat back.

407
00:22:22,211 --> 00:22:26,140
The customer's order is right afterwards.
So I like a hamburger,

408
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:29,320
a milkshake and some fries. Uh, please.

409
00:22:29,321 --> 00:22:33,490
And then the waitress would say like
a hamburger, milkshake and fries.

410
00:22:33,491 --> 00:22:36,940
Just repeat back the order or not.
If she repeated back the order,

411
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:40,420
the tips are on the right. They're
significantly more tips at the end, uh,

412
00:22:40,421 --> 00:22:43,910
than otherwise. This is a
French department store. Uh, uh,

413
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:47,070
electronics department,
part of the French department store,

414
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,260
large French department store and MP,
three players here. The same thing.

415
00:22:50,261 --> 00:22:53,580
They repeated back with the customer
said when they, I'd like, uh, uh,

416
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:57,630
look at an MP, three player for my
grandson. He's turning 13 next week. Oh,

417
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,440
you're like an MP,
three player for your grandson.

418
00:22:59,441 --> 00:23:04,360
He's turning 13 next week or
not. Right. Or just, okay,
here's the MP. Three players.

419
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:10,230
Sales went from 63 to 87% in the a mimicry
condition and customer satisfaction

420
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:14,620
with the store.
And the clerk was markedly higher.

421
00:23:14,621 --> 00:23:17,770
They went out to the parking lot and
ask those kinds of questions afterwards.

422
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,710
So real,
real life consequences.

423
00:23:20,711 --> 00:23:25,030
Now the other thing about the
president is the context changes. You,

424
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:29,020
you can be a different person at home,
uh, as, as a, as you are at work.

425
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:30,970
Um, my, my,

426
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:35,170
my sister was actually at the talk I
gave in San Francisco the other day. Uh,

427
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:40,180
and we're looking at a show like this is
not our mother isn't who, yeah, it is.

428
00:23:40,181 --> 00:23:43,750
This is our mother. Um, so you can be
a different person in different places.

429
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,800
Right? Well, Ernst Fehr,

430
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:48,440
who's a professor of economics
at the University of Zurich,

431
00:23:48,441 --> 00:23:52,490
has actually been tipped to win a
Nobel prize in economics one day soon.

432
00:23:52,491 --> 00:23:56,060
You might hear his name again, has done
studies looking at investment bankers.

433
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:57,620
Big thing in Zurich,
right?

434
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,850
So investment bankers might be a different
people at work than they are at home.

435
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:06,960
What he did was to get them at home on
a weekend and he had them play a coin

436
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,180
toss game where every heads that they
tossed, they'd get 20 Swiss francs.

437
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,730
So I think there were 20 coin flips
so you can win up to 400 if you get

438
00:24:16,731 --> 00:24:21,320
magically all, all 20 heads. You were
the one who reported what you got,

439
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:24,200
so no one would know you're at home.

440
00:24:24,201 --> 00:24:26,960
You can say you've got 20 if you know
that no one would know the difference.

441
00:24:26,961 --> 00:24:31,640
Right. But you know by on average you're
going to get 10 out of 20 heads on the

442
00:24:31,641 --> 00:24:35,000
average. Uh, what he did in this
study was to get them at home,

443
00:24:35,001 --> 00:24:39,230
but for some of them he had them describe
their workplace with their office was

444
00:24:39,231 --> 00:24:43,580
like, so we got them thinking about their
office right before this a game and the

445
00:24:43,581 --> 00:24:45,050
other condition,
they did not do that.

446
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:48,590
It's the same people randomly assigned
to be the office or the home condition

447
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:52,370
and you probably can't see this, but
on the left, these are the home people.

448
00:24:52,371 --> 00:24:54,200
They were not asked to
think about their office.

449
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,630
And you get pretty much
the binomial distribution,

450
00:24:56,631 --> 00:24:58,640
which means this is what
you'd expect by chance.

451
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,250
You get some people on the low end,
you get some people on the high end.

452
00:25:01,251 --> 00:25:02,360
But most people are right there,
you know,

453
00:25:02,361 --> 00:25:05,930
four or five or six in the middle or
whatever it is. The, the, at the average,

454
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:10,880
the people on the right are the people
who thought about their workplace.

455
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:14,990
It's shifted significantly to the right.
You can get this guy saying, oh yeah,

456
00:25:14,991 --> 00:25:16,940
you know, I got like all
heads are, you know, again,

457
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:21,350
you've got a lot of heads over there.
Um, and you know, they're greedier,

458
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,960
they're less moral,
they're less honest.

459
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:27,620
The same people randomly assigned if
they just thought about their office in

460
00:25:27,621 --> 00:25:30,530
this mundane kind of
way, uh, before the task.

461
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:34,220
And he's talking about situated identities
that you might be a different person

462
00:25:34,221 --> 00:25:38,030
at home, a different values and
different behaviors than you are at, uh,

463
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:42,410
at your workplace. Unfortunately,
this hack, this actually affects kids.

464
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,110
This is a study that at
the time was shocking,

465
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:50,960
came out of Harvard about 2004
or five Asian American girls.

466
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,380
Uh, and, uh,

467
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:58,190
they had them color in a
color of a cartoon, uh,

468
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:03,290
with crayons that either emphasize
their Asian identity or they're female,

469
00:26:03,291 --> 00:26:08,090
they're girl identity with Asian themes
or with, uh, girls playing with dolls.

470
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:13,370
Now the stereotype of the culture is
Asian Americans are better at math and

471
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:18,260
science then everybody else, uh, than
the average person. But girls are not.

472
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:21,530
Girls are worse at math and
science then everybody else.

473
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:25,630
So if they had colored in the Asian
American of the Asian themes, the there,

474
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,140
then they took a math test there,

475
00:26:27,141 --> 00:26:29,660
mat test was significantly higher
than the average of the group.

476
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,580
If they had just colored in the girl ones,

477
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:35,870
their average was significantly lower
than average of the group. Now remember,

478
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,130
they're randomly assigned.

479
00:26:37,131 --> 00:26:40,640
These are the same kids randomly
assigned to be in the Asian or the girl

480
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:41,390
condition.

481
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:46,320
The stereotypes of a culture about the
qualities or the capabilities of groups

482
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:49,790
has already gotten into
their head at age five. Um,

483
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:52,230
and influencing their actual
performance on a math test.

484
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,880
They are different person depending on
which aspect of their identity has been

485
00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:02,320
made presently salient. So
the future to, to wrap up, um,

486
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,930
the future, your goals change what
you think are good or bad things,

487
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,940
the health risks,
you're willing to take,

488
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:12,870
who you consider to be your best
friends, uh, and so forth and so on.

489
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,810
There's lots of stuff. I
mean, for me, uh, you know,

490
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:19,860
th th the feeling of the goal and the
motive is strong when I'm playing these

491
00:27:19,861 --> 00:27:24,780
dumb game apps on my phone and I candy
crush and I'm like trying to beat this

492
00:27:24,781 --> 00:27:29,070
level for weeks and I can't, I almost,
I'm just almost there. And you know,

493
00:27:29,071 --> 00:27:33,630
the in APP purchase, right? These games
are free, but the, in that purchase,

494
00:27:33,631 --> 00:27:37,660
right then that purse, oh, for union $5,
you can get five extra moves like, yeah,

495
00:27:37,661 --> 00:27:41,760
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So you, you
beat this level, Yay. And you move on.

496
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,900
And then of course you get the bill.
You know, apple I do at every, you know,

497
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:49,120
five 99 Dah. As I go, my God, it's like,
well, we'll see the stupid game of Mifa.

498
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,540
Who Cares? No one's going
know is no trophy given out.

499
00:27:51,541 --> 00:27:54,240
And recognition of winning candy crush me,
what am I?

500
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:59,070
But at the time the goal is so close and
you almost are there and the feeling is

501
00:27:59,071 --> 00:28:03,060
very strong if you really are into this
game and are trying to beat all the

502
00:28:03,061 --> 00:28:04,110
levels,
that kind of thing.

503
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,010
So your goal changes what you think
is as good or bad thing to do. Uh,

504
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:11,130
in a more important way.
Um, these are, uh, again,

505
00:28:11,131 --> 00:28:15,720
a Dutch grocery store reminded at the
beginning if with a recipe flyer with

506
00:28:15,721 --> 00:28:18,330
words related to healthy eating or dieting

507
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:22,830
and these are obese shoppers or not, it'd
be shoppers. So now it'll be shoppers.

508
00:28:22,831 --> 00:28:26,370
This PR, these primes and the recipe
fliers do not make any difference on their

509
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,150
purchases.

510
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:32,050
But if the people who presumably more
likely to have a a dieting goal and on

511
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:33,390
eating healthy goal,

512
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:37,740
these words and recipe fliers actually
change how much unhealthy snack food they

513
00:28:37,741 --> 00:28:42,741
buy from B four and 20
euros to one and 80 euros.

514
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,730
And they have no memory
of the recipe flyer,

515
00:28:44,731 --> 00:28:48,390
what was in it and have any idea that
that influenced, influenced them at all.

516
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:50,160
What they did was activate the goal.

517
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:53,070
They had four diet and healthy
eating and actually change their,

518
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:56,370
their purchases when they looked
at the, uh, receipts at the end.

519
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:02,400
Same thing. This is a university of
Minnesota study, uh, with um, uh,

520
00:29:02,401 --> 00:29:07,200
undergraduate women who say they don't
think diet pills and tanning salons were

521
00:29:07,201 --> 00:29:10,740
a good idea, the health risks
and they're dangerous. Uh,

522
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,800
but if they just looked in Tinder and
other kinds of dating sites and were asked

523
00:29:13,801 --> 00:29:18,140
to rate the attractiveness of both men
and women on the site activating, uh,

524
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:22,280
like we want to call it a main goal or
the idea of finding a mate and partner or

525
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,640
sex,
whatever you want to call it.

526
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:28,650
Now they do these ratings
and then suddenly they're
fine with tanning salons and

527
00:29:28,651 --> 00:29:30,990
diet pills and don't think
they're risky at all.

528
00:29:30,991 --> 00:29:32,460
It didn't think they'd hurt them at all.

529
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:36,960
And so the same people are changed by
the fact that they've got this goal being

530
00:29:36,961 --> 00:29:38,640
attractive as good for that goal.

531
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,100
It may not be good for you and it may
not reflect your chronic or long term

532
00:29:42,101 --> 00:29:44,830
values, but temporarily
you think it's a good idea.

533
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:50,980
So what's changed you as I said,
these things operate in the background.

534
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:55,150
They can work on problems that you have
and you maybe you've even forgot about,

535
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:57,580
uh, what, what it was you're trying
to remember something, you know,

536
00:29:57,581 --> 00:30:01,040
you know it but you can't remember it
and you see here, try, try, try, uh,

537
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,143
to remember it.

538
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:05,380
And later on you're doing something
completely different three or four hours

539
00:30:05,381 --> 00:30:08,200
later and the answer pops into
your head out of the blue.

540
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,130
But it was because unconsciously you were
still trying to solve that problem in

541
00:30:12,131 --> 00:30:14,380
the background.
You have a goal to solve it.

542
00:30:14,381 --> 00:30:17,740
You really want to solve it and you trying
to figure out that answer and you get

543
00:30:17,741 --> 00:30:19,660
it later when you're thinking
about something else.

544
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,370
Sherlock Holmes did this all the time.
I've read the,

545
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:26,830
all the novels and the complete short
stories over and over again. When,

546
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,600
when Sherlock Holmes comes to a,
um,

547
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:32,560
a impasse and can't make progress on
some crime or something he's trying to

548
00:30:32,561 --> 00:30:35,890
solve, he takes a break. It plays
the violin, he takes cocaine,

549
00:30:35,891 --> 00:30:39,700
you did something else and he comes
back his pine trees freshed and he has

550
00:30:39,701 --> 00:30:43,240
insights and he has breakthroughs, right?
He thinks he's, he's refreshed his mind.

551
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:47,830
What's really going on is while he's, his
conscious mind has been elsewhere, uh,

552
00:30:47,831 --> 00:30:52,210
unconscious processes continue to work
on that problem and sometimes can do a

553
00:30:52,211 --> 00:30:56,200
better job than we can do consciously
for reasons explained in the book,

554
00:30:56,201 --> 00:30:59,680
but reasons for unconscious kinds
of processes being bettered,

555
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:03,580
a processing information in parallel
and better for complex decisions and

556
00:31:03,581 --> 00:31:07,700
complex problems sometimes and
then more limited focus, uh,

557
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,770
conscious thinking.

558
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:13,180
Sometimes they come to you and when
you're doing something else like Eureka in

559
00:31:13,181 --> 00:31:16,180
the, in the bathtub running
naked, this is a g rated version,

560
00:31:16,181 --> 00:31:18,280
but he actually was naked according
to historians at the time,

561
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:21,940
ran naked through the streets of Syracuse
after discovering the principle that

562
00:31:21,941 --> 00:31:26,040
he was working on in a public bath.
And there were,

563
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,260
there have been dreams. The benzene
ring, a ring theory calculate,

564
00:31:29,261 --> 00:31:33,100
came up with a benzene ring theory and
a dream of snake eating each other's

565
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:37,720
tails and a fiery kind of circle. Uh, I
had my own alligator dream this described,

566
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:41,860
uh, in the book, but it's the same kind
of experience where it's just, you know,

567
00:31:41,861 --> 00:31:42,431
the answer.

568
00:31:42,431 --> 00:31:45,550
You've been working on something for
five or 10 years and it comes to you in

569
00:31:45,551 --> 00:31:47,440
this kind of dream work,

570
00:31:47,441 --> 00:31:51,220
which is actually another way of
this problem is being worked on,

571
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:55,450
uh, when you're not actually
consciously thinking about it.

572
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:00,480
If it's a very important problem as it
was to, um, both, uh, calculate and, uh,

573
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:05,430
and myself. So people have worried
about these things, uh, in terms of, um,

574
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:07,340
mine control and,
uh,

575
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:10,990
whether you can use these
kinds of influences on,

576
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:15,910
on people to get them to do things that
they maybe didn't want to do on their

577
00:32:15,911 --> 00:32:19,390
own. Um, and so, uh, you know,

578
00:32:19,391 --> 00:32:23,110
we do need to think about and talk about
that because it is something that, um,

579
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,810
that, uh, is it legitimate to worry about.

580
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:32,800
But just briefly and that's, that's
where I'm going to wrap up. Um, you know,

581
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:36,880
economist magazine, uh,
worries about mind control, uh,

582
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:39,770
has issues about that.
In the past,

583
00:32:39,771 --> 00:32:43,100
there been books like communism
hypnotism and the Beatles.

584
00:32:43,101 --> 00:32:46,400
This is actually a book that came out
in 19 seven years old that the Beatles

585
00:32:46,401 --> 00:32:49,520
were trying to hypnotize us and make
us communists through their evil beat.

586
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:54,280
You can get these on Ebay aluminum foil,
the Fucker beanies that prevent, uh,

587
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:59,090
aliens from outer space, from sending
rays that influenced your mind. Uh,

588
00:32:59,091 --> 00:33:01,100
and of course the sex
and the ice cube stuff.

589
00:33:01,101 --> 00:33:03,830
There's still books on their subliminal
seduction that had this kind of worry

590
00:33:03,831 --> 00:33:05,570
that that's what's going
on in these kinds of ads.

591
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:11,020
And this is actually a subliminal ad
that was played on widely during the Bush

592
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,950
Gore campaign in 2000.

593
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:18,230
This is an actual ad from the Bush
campaign that it was discovered actually

594
00:33:18,231 --> 00:33:22,670
subliminally put the word rats right
before the word Democrats appeared in

595
00:33:22,671 --> 00:33:27,280
September of 2000 trying to emphasize
the rats part of Democrats. Uh,

596
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,950
and they denied it. They meant to do this
and this kind of stuff. And George W.

597
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:32,300
Bush 43,
uh,

598
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:34,940
kept denying this for weeks afterwards
saying they don't engage in this

599
00:33:34,941 --> 00:33:39,200
subliminal advertising over
and over again, but they were.

600
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,290
So, you know, those things you
don't really have to worry about.

601
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,600
These on the left are really true.

602
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:48,140
They really are influencing us outside
of our awareness and our influences that

603
00:33:48,141 --> 00:33:50,340
if we know about them,
we can do something about them and we,

604
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:53,210
we can actually use them to our advantage.
We can turn them around and,

605
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:55,150
and have them help us to,

606
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,240
to get done what we want and help us do
the right thing that we want to do and

607
00:33:59,241 --> 00:34:01,610
that kind of thing once we know
all about them. But you know,

608
00:34:01,611 --> 00:34:04,970
some people are insisting that they're
the captain of their soul and the captain

609
00:34:04,971 --> 00:34:08,180
of their ship and none of
those things ever, you know,
everything I influences me,

610
00:34:08,181 --> 00:34:11,180
I'm aware of an eye in town and
nothing else really influences me.

611
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:16,180
But the really good ship captains are the
ones who take the current and the wind

612
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,193
into account.

613
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,950
They don't just aim their ship at the
port and say that's all that matters.

614
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,950
The current and the wins don't matter
at all because if they do that,

615
00:34:24,951 --> 00:34:28,070
this happens, you get crashed in
the rocks are carried out to sea,

616
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:28,971
you can play golf.

617
00:34:28,971 --> 00:34:32,150
That way you can aim right at the hole
and fat for Goodwin doesn't matter and

618
00:34:32,151 --> 00:34:35,660
whatever. And this is what happens to you
then. Uh, so you know, it's your choice.

619
00:34:35,661 --> 00:34:39,920
Everyone has the ability to
make that choice on their own.

620
00:34:39,921 --> 00:34:42,530
But really the point is
you actually do have,

621
00:34:42,531 --> 00:34:46,610
we all have control over these things
because they're really not secret anymore.

622
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,270
And once you know about them,
you know,

623
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:50,460
it's up to you what you want
to do with them. But, uh,

624
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:53,240
I want to thank you all for coming
and I'm for listening today.

625
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:58,800
[inaudible]

626
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,800
how could we apply some of these
techniques if I'm trying to lose weight,

627
00:35:01,801 --> 00:35:04,380
how can we apply some of these
techniques to that? For example,

628
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,330
so this is really recent stuff.
The last five or six years,

629
00:35:09,331 --> 00:35:10,410
it's not my area,

630
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:14,700
but I read the research and every
a researcher now a five, six,

631
00:35:14,701 --> 00:35:18,780
seven of the major researchers in the
area of self control and self regulation,

632
00:35:18,781 --> 00:35:19,614
right,

633
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,000
are saying the people who are effective
self regulators who score high on those

634
00:35:24,001 --> 00:35:27,180
scales,
they people who are good self control,

635
00:35:27,181 --> 00:35:31,050
people on self regulators make more
money than anybody. The rest of us,

636
00:35:31,051 --> 00:35:35,100
they are happier, they have a better
relationships, they're healthier.

637
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,200
All those good things. It comes
with these who are high in this uh,

638
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,610
ability to self regulate and self
control. How did they do it? Well,

639
00:35:41,611 --> 00:35:45,150
the old model is acts of will they have
such a strong will and the rest of us

640
00:35:45,151 --> 00:35:48,060
are just weak willed little wimps and
we can't do the things they can do with

641
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,910
her strong will.
It's actually the opposite of that.

642
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,550
They don't use willpower.

643
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:57,120
Willpower is hard to do
and it's always a struggle.

644
00:35:57,121 --> 00:36:00,000
What they do is they set up their world
to make it easy for them to do the

645
00:36:00,001 --> 00:36:00,900
things they wanna do.

646
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:04,590
They set up their environment in a way
that they don't have the tempting things

647
00:36:04,591 --> 00:36:07,830
that they could eat or drink at home. They
don't bio's things in the first place.

648
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,140
They set up the good
things they want to do.

649
00:36:10,141 --> 00:36:12,570
They make good habits out of them
and make routines out of them.

650
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:15,240
They start by saying, okay, I want
to exercise. I want to go running.

651
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,021
They come home,

652
00:36:16,021 --> 00:36:18,300
they get out of their work clothes and
they immediately put on their running

653
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,670
shorts and running shoes because what
else are you going to do after you put on

654
00:36:20,671 --> 00:36:24,360
your running shoes and you're running
stuff but go run and they make that so

655
00:36:24,361 --> 00:36:26,700
that they do it without even
thinking. They come home, they change,

656
00:36:26,701 --> 00:36:30,180
they put that on and without
having to use any willpower at all.

657
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:32,670
So the effective self
control and self regulator,

658
00:36:32,671 --> 00:36:36,960
people are making use of the unconscious
kinds of influences of habit and

659
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:39,090
routine and setting up their world.

660
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:42,030
If they want to be a kinder and helpful,

661
00:36:42,031 --> 00:36:46,020
they'll put up a photograph of the people
they want to be kind and help to in

662
00:36:46,021 --> 00:36:47,130
their life.
Like their grandmother.

663
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,010
They always are kind and helpful to
their grandmother if they might have a

664
00:36:50,011 --> 00:36:53,760
picture of her on their desk as a reminder
without thinking about it to be that

665
00:36:53,761 --> 00:36:56,790
way or whatever it is, you know,
high achievement, whatever it is.

666
00:36:56,910 --> 00:37:00,810
You make your world to have those cues
come in from the outside that trigger

667
00:37:00,811 --> 00:37:03,600
these tendencies that you want
to support and build your,

668
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:06,970
your world so that the outside world
supports it instead of terrorists,

669
00:37:06,971 --> 00:37:08,910
those things down and that's what they do.

670
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:14,010
So that that would apply to a losing
weight. It would apply to exercising.

671
00:37:14,011 --> 00:37:17,220
It would apply to pretty much anything
you want to do. Thanks for the talk.

672
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:19,070
So shallow,
shallow or final goal.

673
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:24,250
Be really too on [inaudible] and decipher
unconsciousness as much as we can so

674
00:37:25,431 --> 00:37:27,530
that you can cope with
unconsciousness better.

675
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:31,430
Or is there some level in which
having some level of unconsciousness,

676
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:36,380
it's actually a healthy thing and you
should just let let it be Indian? Yeah.

677
00:37:36,381 --> 00:37:40,550
This is the hardest chapter of this book
to write for me was a chapter called

678
00:37:40,551 --> 00:37:44,300
when can you trust your gut? Because
in the past we've had books like blink,

679
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:44,930
right?

680
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:48,920
Best sellers that say trust your gut and
other books like thinking fast and slow,

681
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:51,680
they say don't trust your gut and they're
both sitting there and paper back in

682
00:37:51,681 --> 00:37:54,470
the storage right next to each other,
right? They say the opposite thing.

683
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,470
So it's a little more nuanced than that.

684
00:37:57,471 --> 00:38:00,050
It's a little more difficult
question than that. Uh,

685
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:04,940
you pretty much can trust your gut and
you can trust unconscious influences,

686
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:08,540
uh, in, in certain situations
and not in others. Uh,

687
00:38:08,541 --> 00:38:11,930
one rule is if it's your preference and
kinds of things you like or dislike,

688
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,880
your first kind of reactions usually are
the best. And you can overthink your,

689
00:38:15,881 --> 00:38:18,920
your feelings and get something different
because of that and not be as happy

690
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,750
with that choice.
If you overthink it,

691
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,350
you can trust your gut about other people
that you're meeting as long as you see

692
00:38:24,351 --> 00:38:25,184
them in action.

693
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,120
If you see that just the face or you know
their characteristics like skin color

694
00:38:29,121 --> 00:38:32,630
or age and so forth, then you can be very
wrong. But if you see them in action,

695
00:38:32,631 --> 00:38:34,220
usually we're pretty good about that.
So I,

696
00:38:34,221 --> 00:38:37,780
the one thing that the rule for other
people is to always give people a chance.

697
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:40,660
Don't judge them just on what the
way they look or what you think.

698
00:38:40,661 --> 00:38:45,040
Cause it's very powerful. Studies
in, in courtrooms, for example,

699
00:38:45,041 --> 00:38:48,190
have found that baby faced individuals
have more of a childlike face,

700
00:38:48,191 --> 00:38:51,580
get lower sentences or less likely to
be found guilty for the same crimes as

701
00:38:51,581 --> 00:38:55,660
people who aren't baby faced. And
unfortunately, people of color,

702
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:58,570
the darker the color, the longer the
sentence they get for the same crime.

703
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:02,080
And this is going on right now.
This isn't something in the past.

704
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,170
So these things really
matter to real outcomes.

705
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:08,560
And unfortunately people like judges and
people in legal system deny this stuff

706
00:39:08,561 --> 00:39:12,490
happens. They don't know that that's not
an influence. I just tell my jury not to,

707
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:16,060
not to be influenced by those
things. Really. That's what,

708
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:18,820
that's what actual trial judges say
to people who point out this kind of

709
00:39:18,821 --> 00:39:23,650
evidence. So they just said, you know,
so when can you trust unconscious?

710
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:27,940
I'll tell you one thing. Uh, I heard
from somebody. Um, uh, well anyway,

711
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,380
other people say the same kind of thing.

712
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:32,950
I was on the channel five a morning
show this morning and somebody in the

713
00:39:32,951 --> 00:39:36,070
audience said the same thing
that I'm going to say now. Um,

714
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:39,680
I would give myself assignments.
Basically when I'd finished,

715
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:42,340
I broke this book basically
last year in six months.

716
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:44,320
I wouldn't try to ride it for four years,

717
00:39:44,321 --> 00:39:47,500
but it finally clicked and I
finally was able, amazing day one,

718
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,430
almost a chapter a week and it just was
coming out of me and what was going on

719
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:55,000
after I'd finished a chapter. You Think,
oh good, I finished a chapter, you know,

720
00:39:55,001 --> 00:39:58,030
relax, have fun for a while and
then start the next one tomorrow.

721
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:01,150
But before I would do that,
I always get the next chapter in my head.

722
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,750
I'd always take the next day stuff and
start looking at it and get it all up

723
00:40:04,751 --> 00:40:09,250
here and then go have fun and then go
relax, be with my daughter, you know,

724
00:40:09,251 --> 00:40:11,680
go shopping, do the chores,
whatever I needed to do.

725
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:14,770
But I'd always get the next thing
in my head first. So it would be,

726
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:18,550
I'd be working on it without, you know,
unconsciously basically. And boy was,

727
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,661
it was great.

728
00:40:19,661 --> 00:40:22,720
You come back the next day and I'd have
ideas about how to organize and put it

729
00:40:22,721 --> 00:40:24,250
all together and get going right away.

730
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:27,460
Much better than if you leave it
and start cold the next morning.

731
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:30,030
So those are the things you kind of use.
One other thing I just,

732
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:33,490
this is my favorite little tip like life
hat kind of thing out of this is this

733
00:40:33,491 --> 00:40:36,340
thing about bonding and imitation.
You can use that.

734
00:40:36,341 --> 00:40:41,341
It's so easy because we naturally imitate
and mimic each other without trying

735
00:40:42,251 --> 00:40:46,810
to, you don't want to try to, all you
need to do is look at the other person.

736
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:49,420
So if you're meeting somebody in new
colleague and new work, somebody,

737
00:40:49,421 --> 00:40:53,290
a new neighbor just moved in, you know, a
new friend, you know, anything like that.

738
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:56,650
Just look at them while you were
interacting for the first time.

739
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:59,260
You will naturally because
you're just looking at them,

740
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:04,030
imitate what they do that will naturally
cause them to bond and like with you

741
00:41:04,031 --> 00:41:07,360
more than if you hadn't done that.
And the, the, the, the, the tech,

742
00:41:07,361 --> 00:41:11,220
the trick is just to look at them and
turns out that on, on empathy scales,

743
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:14,170
people who have a personality is
higher empathic than other people.

744
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:18,670
They also are the people who look more
and perceive more at the other person

745
00:41:18,671 --> 00:41:19,510
while they're interacting.

746
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:24,580
And it's a real easy thing to do and it
has all these potentially good benefits

747
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:27,910
and you're just letting this sort of
unconscious mechanism operate on its own

748
00:41:27,911 --> 00:41:28,744
naturally.

749
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:33,980
When you say that things
like cooperation and obesity

750
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:37,850
can have effects two or three
degrees from your social network,

751
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:41,750
how do you know what's cause
and what's effect? They're like,

752
00:41:41,751 --> 00:41:42,830
how do you know it's not the case?

753
00:41:42,831 --> 00:41:47,831
Dad say obese people tend to be more
friends with each other than otherwise.

754
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,320
Oh,
you can't.

755
00:41:50,321 --> 00:41:54,010
These are correlational studies that the
social network analysis and sociology

756
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:56,800
is correlational. Uh,
the Facebook study was,

757
00:41:56,830 --> 00:42:00,790
was a actual experimental because they
manipulated the news feed and showed,

758
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:05,970
but even the earlier Facebook study
showing a contagion were correlational.

759
00:42:06,641 --> 00:42:10,720
That's why Kramer did this second study.
The first one showed the contagion,

760
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:14,380
but say, well, you know,
the, the objection was just
what you said and then say,

761
00:42:14,381 --> 00:42:16,420
okay,
you experimentally manipulate it.

762
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:18,760
It was very controversial
because you know,

763
00:42:18,761 --> 00:42:22,330
you're playing around with people's Moods,
right? And it's the end of the user,

764
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:24,280
the end of the agreement,
what do you call those things?

765
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:28,150
It's like on page 5,004 that year it was
okay to do that and no one ever reads

766
00:42:28,151 --> 00:42:29,590
those, right? So, uh,

767
00:42:29,591 --> 00:42:32,770
they said it was okay because of the
people using Facebook agreed to this

768
00:42:32,771 --> 00:42:34,870
because it's in the agreement.
Um,

769
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:37,600
but then they did the experimental
version and showed the same effect.

770
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,810
So you're absolutely right in the
sociological, a social network.

771
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:42,520
The reason I put that up
there, it's a, it's a,

772
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:44,650
it's a new method that
shows it actually happening.

773
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:48,070
It does not give a conclusive
answer about the cause.

774
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:49,540
The other studies like ours,

775
00:42:49,541 --> 00:42:53,710
when we manipulate what people do and show
the same effect that, that, that helps,

776
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:56,620
uh, make you feel better
about the causal nature of it.

777
00:42:57,730 --> 00:42:59,710
You have to do both though.
You have to do both kinds of studies

778
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:05,060
says the mimicry, why everyone
likes parents as a, as a pet bird.

779
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:11,540
I got a good pair of joke at my,
uh, my real question is that,

780
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:14,530
so at Google we have a,
well,

781
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:19,580
we have a lot of training programs around
trying to tackle unconscious biases

782
00:43:20,301 --> 00:43:24,680
and uh, in fact in the promotion
committee processes we have,

783
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:29,030
everyone's required to go through the
unconscious bias training prior to

784
00:43:29,031 --> 00:43:32,410
actually serving on a promotion
committee. I was just wondering, um,

785
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:36,500
in the broader, um, uh,
industry with, through uh,

786
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:41,060
in other corporations, other,
um, other organizations settings,

787
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:46,220
have you looked into research around a
unconscious bias training and trying to

788
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:48,980
steer the effects of these,
uh, biases have them,

789
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:52,210
that is a cottage industry that's
outside of academia basically.

790
00:43:52,211 --> 00:43:55,690
I remember there was a, I look at Tumblr
sometimes and I may have a little dumb,

791
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,120
you know, nature picture thing
on tumbler with three followers.

792
00:43:58,121 --> 00:44:01,630
And since I'm on there like a few Fridays
ago, maybe three or four Fridays ago,

793
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:04,900
it was an open question and
answer on unconscious bias.

794
00:44:04,901 --> 00:44:07,060
And those people who are
answering the questions,

795
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:08,680
I don't know any of them
and I haven't heard,

796
00:44:08,681 --> 00:44:12,310
but they're all in the private sector
or the, they're an industry. Uh,

797
00:44:12,311 --> 00:44:14,200
so I don't really know
what the kind of training,

798
00:44:14,201 --> 00:44:18,220
I know that they do talk about the Harvard
implicit IAT kinds of tests that you

799
00:44:18,221 --> 00:44:22,160
can take to detect the fact that you
might have some unconscious bias. Um,

800
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:24,240
it's a little, uh, it's a,

801
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:27,100
it's a much simpler version than what
I'm talking about in the book because the

802
00:44:27,101 --> 00:44:30,820
unconscious bias they measure is just
good or bad. It's just you have a,

803
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:35,970
or a negative association
with these groups and that
that can be mis attributed.

804
00:44:35,971 --> 00:44:39,690
So the idea of this is, this would fall
into the present section of the book,

805
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:43,860
that you have a negative feeling towards
a member of a different social group

806
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:45,030
and that negative feeling,

807
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:48,240
you don't know the real
source of it because it says
unconscious kind of source.

808
00:44:48,241 --> 00:44:51,660
And then you use the attributed to
something that makes plausible sense. Oh,

809
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:54,510
they didn't have such good letters of
recommendation or they didn't come from a

810
00:44:54,511 --> 00:44:57,780
very good school or you know,
you somehow explain it in some,

811
00:44:57,810 --> 00:44:59,940
in terms of something
that may be plausible.

812
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:04,230
So that's a real danger is that even well,
meaning well intentioned people,

813
00:45:04,231 --> 00:45:08,400
Egalitarian people fall
prey to this misattribution
effect because they have the

814
00:45:08,401 --> 00:45:11,730
negative feeling not knowing what the
source is and then apply it to something

815
00:45:11,731 --> 00:45:14,390
that is plausible that they can
say, oh, I didn't like this or that.

816
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:18,330
And makes you know, sense it's not, their
skin color is not their gender, you know?

817
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:20,580
But there's so many demonstrations.
I mean, in the book,

818
00:45:20,581 --> 00:45:24,060
talk about this new Italian study,
which is horrible.

819
00:45:24,061 --> 00:45:28,800
This is a 11,000 job applications,
actual jobs postings in Italy.

820
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:33,260
And what they did was they made up a,
an identical set of resumes, identical,

821
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:36,840
uh, qualifications, education.
Everything is identical.

822
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:41,220
They either made it a male or
a female applicant by the name,

823
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:45,270
and they put either an attractive or an
unattractive photograph along with the

824
00:45:45,271 --> 00:45:49,170
application. And they sent all four
to all the 11,000 jobs in Italy.

825
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,990
And these were actual jobs they wanted
to see who got called back for an

826
00:45:51,991 --> 00:45:54,450
interview among the women,

827
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:58,260
57% of the attractive woman
got called in for an interview.

828
00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:03,150
7% of the unattractive women got called
in for an interview. Now you may say,

829
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:03,480
well,

830
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:07,050
they're just intentionally trying to
hire the attractive women and you talk to

831
00:46:07,051 --> 00:46:09,690
the people and no, that's not what we're
trying to do. And that would be illegal.

832
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:11,670
They don't want to do that.
They say they don't.

833
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:16,290
And yet they have this bias called the
beauty premium. That's huge. I mean,

834
00:46:16,291 --> 00:46:21,030
57 to 70 for men, it's 47 to 25.
I mean, it's bad for men too,

835
00:46:21,031 --> 00:46:22,470
but for women,
it's gigantic.

836
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:27,180
And these are people who are not given
the same economic opportunities because

837
00:46:27,181 --> 00:46:30,680
of these kinds of biases. So in
real life right now, you know,

838
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:33,810
not back in the past, these
things really are a problem. Uh,

839
00:46:33,811 --> 00:46:36,270
and they have to do with biases
that people aren't aware of.

840
00:46:36,271 --> 00:46:39,270
But now we should know
more about these biases.

841
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:42,450
And we should be able to take
steps to stop them. You know,

842
00:46:42,451 --> 00:46:45,450
like not having photographs on
applications for one thing. Right?

843
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,840
And I know an orchestra's, uh,
the tryouts are behind a curtain.

844
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:52,710
You don't know the age, you don't know
the gender, you don't know the race,

845
00:46:52,711 --> 00:46:55,830
the ethnicity, whatever you want to call
it, of the person behind the curtain.

846
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:58,140
You can only hear the music.
If we could do that.

847
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:00,180
And that's easy to do for orchestras,
right?

848
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,430
It's not yet easy to do in other areas,

849
00:47:02,431 --> 00:47:05,460
but removing those kinds of
cues that the culture gives us,

850
00:47:05,461 --> 00:47:09,150
it says this group can do this,
this group can't do that. You know,

851
00:47:09,151 --> 00:47:11,010
we get from the culture
and soaks into all of us.

852
00:47:11,011 --> 00:47:14,580
Even if we are well meaning and well
intentioned and egalitarian people,

853
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:18,330
it's still in our heads. We'd get rid
of those cues. We'd be a lot better off.

854
00:47:18,331 --> 00:47:21,150
We can do a lot more now. I don't
know if that's what they do. See,

855
00:47:21,151 --> 00:47:23,460
I don't know the training and,
and what they're about.

856
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:25,890
But that would be my
answer or my solution or,

857
00:47:25,891 --> 00:47:29,010
but I would suggest based
on the research now what we

858
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,350
do here is, uh, it,

859
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:33,640
it depends on if you're taking the online
version of the training or if you're

860
00:47:33,641 --> 00:47:37,690
doing the, um, the, the in
person training sessions.

861
00:47:37,691 --> 00:47:41,630
But the in person training sessions
tried to really focus on, um,

862
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:44,410
trying to incite these biases,

863
00:47:44,411 --> 00:47:47,750
trigger these biases that someone might
not realize that they have and say,

864
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,110
then you can reflect on,
on having,

865
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,270
on realizing that you had
that bias that you didn't

866
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:56,700
it because I, I have so strongly, I mean,
this is why I went into my field partly,

867
00:47:56,701 --> 00:47:58,910
and I teach this about Yale
undergraduates and everything.

868
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:03,090
And I do get some students walking out
of the room talking about these kinds of

869
00:48:03,091 --> 00:48:06,690
things about privilege and stuff like
that. Uh, but here's what I would say,

870
00:48:06,691 --> 00:48:08,310
because I've got your right
now and I'm gonna say this,

871
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:11,250
the last chapter of the book, and I'll
give it to you for free right now.

872
00:48:11,251 --> 00:48:13,050
What I'm saying.
It's not my own research,

873
00:48:13,051 --> 00:48:16,380
but just a way to combat these
things that actually works.

874
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:20,400
They're called implementation
intentions and not my race.

875
00:48:20,401 --> 00:48:23,700
My colleague Peter Goldwood Cert Nyu.
The idea is this,

876
00:48:23,701 --> 00:48:25,020
when I see a person of color,

877
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:29,280
I will be fair and what you're doing is
you're specifying the trigger out there

878
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:33,060
that will cause the idea of
fairness immediately to happen. You,

879
00:48:33,061 --> 00:48:36,780
you link your intention to the,
into the future state of affairs.

880
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,150
When I see a person of color,
which is going to happen,

881
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:43,770
I will be fair and you, you really
have to commit yourself to that.

882
00:48:43,771 --> 00:48:46,190
It's not a magic trick that if you
don't really, I don't really care about,

883
00:48:46,191 --> 00:48:49,020
I'll say it. You know, magic magic.
It's not a, it's not a magic spell.

884
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:52,020
You have to be really committed in the
first place, but you want to do that.

885
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:55,410
You can say that and actually it works
and that works for lots of things.

886
00:48:55,950 --> 00:48:59,550
You know, when x happens in a reliable
future event, that always happens.

887
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:04,830
I will do y when x happens,
I will do y and that kind of thing helps.

888
00:49:04,831 --> 00:49:05,371
The elderly,

889
00:49:05,371 --> 00:49:08,130
take medications when they
got five different kinds
of pills at different times

890
00:49:08,131 --> 00:49:10,530
of day with food or without food.
All this kind of complicated stuff.

891
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:15,470
It helps them do that. It helps health
psychology is we use this political, uh,

892
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:19,620
people have used this to increase voter
turnout in primary elections because

893
00:49:19,621 --> 00:49:23,370
they say at 10 o'clock on Tuesday morning,
I will take a break from work,

894
00:49:23,371 --> 00:49:26,010
I will drive to the polling place.
And I, you specify the when,

895
00:49:26,011 --> 00:49:29,250
where and how of you're going to take a
carry out your intention instead of I'm

896
00:49:29,251 --> 00:49:33,210
just going to vote. You make
a concrete plan when, where,

897
00:49:33,211 --> 00:49:36,660
and how I'm going to do it. And that
really helps. So if there can be a,

898
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:40,080
when the feisty of encounter a
person of color, I will be fair,

899
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,580
that simple kind of thing.

900
00:49:41,581 --> 00:49:43,950
And they've actually done studies showing
that actually does make people more

901
00:49:43,951 --> 00:49:46,500
fair and treatment.
So maybe that'll work.

902
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:52,810
So I've been told, I have
the honor of asking the last
question. And My, uh, so you,

903
00:49:52,811 --> 00:49:57,100
earlier you mentioned the experiment where
if people were exposed to warm a warm

904
00:49:57,101 --> 00:49:57,640
environment,

905
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:00,910
there were more prone to social warm and
if they were exposed to colder than the

906
00:50:00,911 --> 00:50:02,290
opposite,
uh,

907
00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:06,280
do you know if that is a function
of people using the exact same word,

908
00:50:06,281 --> 00:50:10,690
warm to refer to these two very different
things or versus like social warmth

909
00:50:10,691 --> 00:50:13,860
then acts, physical warmth as,
so, thank you for asking. Asking

910
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:14,693
that.
Uh,

911
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:19,410
it's the reason why we use the word
warm for both and there's lots of George

912
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:22,320
Lake off right at Berkeley has written
all about metaphors we live by and all

913
00:50:22,321 --> 00:50:23,310
these different metaphors.

914
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:27,950
We tend to appropriate a physical language
terms to talk about our relationship

915
00:50:27,951 --> 00:50:30,460
with people. It's almost like there's
no psychology separate language.

916
00:50:30,461 --> 00:50:31,294
It's all physical.

917
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:36,400
So we talk about a distant father or
a close relationship or high status.

918
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:43,040
These are all physical direction, you
know, uh, kinds of terms. A warm friend,

919
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:48,380
a cold friend, a cold boss,
you know, something like that.

920
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:50,330
So why are we using all
these physical terms?

921
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:55,040
Because it turns out these are
researchers who look at child language

922
00:50:55,041 --> 00:50:55,501
development.

923
00:50:55,501 --> 00:50:58,730
It turns out these are
the first experiences that
children have and their direct

924
00:50:58,731 --> 00:51:02,660
experiences. They're the first concept
infants forum and kids, toddlers, former,

925
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:07,130
these warm called high, low, you
know, close and far kinds of terms,

926
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:11,990
rough, smooth, and so our then we
develop understandings of people.

927
00:51:11,991 --> 00:51:16,991
We tend to use that vocabulary and so we
talk about a hard negotiator or soft on

928
00:51:18,441 --> 00:51:19,274
crime.

929
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:20,190
Okay.

930
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:21,990
Which means when we're yielding,
you know,

931
00:51:21,991 --> 00:51:23,910
it's the physical term
all the time and we just,

932
00:51:23,970 --> 00:51:27,690
we all know what each other means to,
we can communicate using these terms.

933
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:30,290
The thing about the warm,
I just want to say no,

934
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:34,830
how many of you are parents are going to
be parents, but this channel of warmth,

935
00:51:34,831 --> 00:51:38,910
a physical warm signaling to the infant
that you can trust that the infant can

936
00:51:38,911 --> 00:51:43,010
trust. Whoever they're with
is gigantic. It's, it's,

937
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:47,640
it's been there since time in memorial
and it's a way that, you know,

938
00:51:47,641 --> 00:51:49,500
now my wife used to work in a hospital.
They say,

939
00:51:49,501 --> 00:51:53,160
she says now that they have the father
opened the shirt and put the baby on on

940
00:51:53,161 --> 00:51:53,641
the fathers,

941
00:51:53,641 --> 00:51:56,940
just not just the mother breastfeeding
because I want the father to also bond

942
00:51:56,941 --> 00:52:00,690
with the child and they say this is
the skin on skin contact, Eh, eh,

943
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:05,010
it may not be the skin on skin as much
as the warmth because to the baby who

944
00:52:05,011 --> 00:52:05,850
doesn't know anything,

945
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:11,060
the feeling of warmth is an ancient of
sign that you can be trusted and is this

946
00:52:11,821 --> 00:52:14,700
channel that works all the way through
our life. It's still there as adults,

947
00:52:14,701 --> 00:52:18,540
but it's hugely important for the
infant who doesn't know who to trust is

948
00:52:18,541 --> 00:52:19,470
totally helpless,

949
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:24,220
is dependent on everybody around
them to keep them fed and warm and,

950
00:52:24,221 --> 00:52:27,900
and uh, have something to drink and
shelter protected from predators.

951
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:31,530
And it's that channel.
So I knew this going in with my daughter.

952
00:52:31,531 --> 00:52:35,370
I hugged and hugged and hugged and
hugged and hugged to make sure she was as

953
00:52:35,371 --> 00:52:38,760
securely attached by age
one at least as possible.

954
00:52:38,761 --> 00:52:43,761
I was basically a single parent raising
this little girl and knowing that it

955
00:52:44,071 --> 00:52:45,750
would affect her the rest of her life,

956
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:47,730
it would affect her
friendships and great school.

957
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:52,080
How long her relationships lasted in
her twenties and if I could just invest,

958
00:52:52,081 --> 00:52:54,030
even though it's so exhausting,
you know, with little, little,

959
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:58,080
little babies and toddlers is invest
as much as my time to do that for her.

960
00:52:58,081 --> 00:53:02,040
Early on, it would pay off her her
forever and we can all do that.

961
00:53:02,070 --> 00:53:06,360
But that channel is there and it can be
used. It seems irrational. It seems silly.

962
00:53:06,361 --> 00:53:10,050
Why would warm, you know, but the
little, no, nothing baby. It matters.

963
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:14,750
It matters everything. Thank you
very much. Thanks for the question.

964
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:19,680
[inaudible].
