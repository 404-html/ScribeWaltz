1
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,410
So I wrote a book called the ants.

2
00:00:07,411 --> 00:00:10,980
The world volcanic apocalypse is lethal
oceans and our quest to understand

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,650
earth's past mass extinctions,
but just kind of a mouthful.

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,820
But this talk and the book is about
the science behind the worst mass

5
00:00:17,821 --> 00:00:19,110
extinctions and arts history.

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,850
So just give you a little context
for what we're talking about. Um,

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,230
the earth is 4.5 billion years old.
Um,

8
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,550
and we're really only concerned with
the last a half billion years or so.

9
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:31,410
So kind of just recent history.
Um,

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,230
and the reason why we're only concerned
about the last half billion years is

11
00:00:34,231 --> 00:00:38,100
because this is really the age of what
we think of as complex life or animal

12
00:00:38,101 --> 00:00:41,520
life. Um, before this, um,

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,860
some cool stuff does
happen at the beginning.

14
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:46,890
There's this thing called the late
heavy bombardment where the earth just

15
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:50,760
getting pelted by giant asteroids
around 2.5 billion years ago.

16
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,020
There's the great oxygenation event when
suddenly auction becomes an appreciable

17
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:58,500
part of the earth atmosphere and kind
of underwrites all the complex life

18
00:00:58,501 --> 00:01:03,270
afterwards. Um, right before
the age of animal life,

19
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:06,480
there's this crazy period of life on earth
called snowball earth where the earth

20
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:10,260
goes in and out of these sort of global
glow [inaudible] glaciations that you

21
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,100
know, froze the planet almost solid
to the tropics. Um, on the other hand,

22
00:01:14,101 --> 00:01:16,800
from 1.8 billion years ago
to 800 million years ago,

23
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,270
there's a period that's so uneventful
that it's called the boring billion,

24
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,550
and it's called that by geologists.
So that really says something. Um, so,

25
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,770
um,
much better visualization for this.

26
00:01:28,771 --> 00:01:31,530
I just want an excuse to show this
picture because I love this picture. Um,

27
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,580
but the,

28
00:01:32,581 --> 00:01:34,800
we're really talking about the top part
of the spiral here when there's things

29
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:38,130
like dinosaurs and a trial bites and
fish and things like that and all those

30
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:41,700
spirals back to the beginning as sort
of the boring billions I was just making

31
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:45,680
fun of. But, so we'll zoom in on
the last 500 million years. Um,

32
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:51,620
there've been five times last 500 million
years when more than 75% of life on

33
00:01:52,231 --> 00:01:57,120
earth goes extinct in what
geologically is a brief period of time.

34
00:01:57,121 --> 00:01:59,550
So this is on the order of thousands
to tens of thousands of years,

35
00:01:59,551 --> 00:02:03,660
which sounds like a long time to us, but
geologically that is like an eye blink.

36
00:02:03,661 --> 00:02:07,800
So we'll just dive right in. The first
one of these is 445 million years ago.

37
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:09,900
It's the end Ordovician mass extinction.

38
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,650
This is an still an
unbelievably long time ago.

39
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:17,160
This is hundreds of millions of years
before dinosaurs or pangea or anything

40
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:18,710
like that. Um, the,

41
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,560
the planet would have looked completely
alien and unrecognizable and here's some

42
00:02:22,561 --> 00:02:25,920
evidence for that. Um, so you
can squint at this all day,

43
00:02:25,921 --> 00:02:28,170
but I don't expect you'll be
able to really Orient Yourself.

44
00:02:28,171 --> 00:02:31,650
But just to help out a little bit,
that one of these floating islands,

45
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,900
the one that sort of, uh, to
the west, that's North America,

46
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,730
it's mostly south of the equator,

47
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,110
rotated about 90 degrees and it's
covered by his mostly underwater too. Um,

48
00:02:40,111 --> 00:02:44,110
and sort of the earth is covered
with a lot of these shallow seas. Um,

49
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,710
and that there's this supercontinent
that's slowly drifting over the south pole

50
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:54,570
called Gun Twana, which is made up
of Africa, South America, Australia,

51
00:02:54,571 --> 00:02:58,710
Antarctica, India, Saudi
Arabia. Um, and interestingly,

52
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:02,020
this little island chain that
sort of down there, that's,

53
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,041
I don't know if you could see it,

54
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:06,610
but that's actually eastern New England
and the Canadian maritimes that in about

55
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:08,560
70 million years is going
to crash into North America.

56
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:09,700
So this is a totally different planet.

57
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:13,540
You'll see that the color
of the continents is kind
of this dull, grayish brown.

58
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:14,920
And that's because,
um,

59
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:19,490
the on land was basically
a barren wasteland. Uh,

60
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,530
there's no trees,
there's hardly any plants at all.

61
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:25,270
The ones that do exist are sort of
weeds around lake margins and stuff,

62
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:29,190
but for the most part, if you went and
visited the land in the Ordovician,

63
00:03:29,191 --> 00:03:32,170
it sort of, would it look like what
you see from the Mars Curiosity rover?

64
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,060
It just would have been a desolate place.
Um,

65
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,730
but there is tons of animal life and
it's under the, it's under the waves.

66
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:37,871
Like I said,

67
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:40,750
there's a lot of these shell of cs c
levels are hundreds of feet taller than

68
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:43,660
they are today. So the continents
were flooded with these shallow seas.

69
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,890
And this is a terrible picture that I
took, but this is from Cincinnati. Um,

70
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,780
and if you drive around
Cincinnati, it's amazing. You,

71
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,170
you see just this gray stratified rock.
And if you go up and look at it,

72
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,390
it's just filled with
seashells and fossils.

73
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,880
And this is from almost a
half billion years ago. Um,

74
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,610
this is one of the most fossil
rich regions in the world.

75
00:04:00,611 --> 00:04:04,120
And it's one of the best examples of
Ordovician sea life and the fossils you

76
00:04:04,121 --> 00:04:05,740
find her from things that look like this.

77
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:09,590
So this is a painting of what life would
have looked like in North America, um,

78
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,550
in these shallow seas.
And so it's known as the sea without fish,

79
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,680
which is something of an overstatement.
There are fish,

80
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,510
there's sort of these
like jawless Weirdos.

81
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,190
There's one right there in the foreground,

82
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,560
but ecologically they're
not that important.

83
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:24,170
And the world is really dominated by
things without backbones, invertebrates.

84
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,350
So it's sort of like a world
of creepy crawlies almost. Um,

85
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,300
you have these things that look like
horseshoe crabs, kind of trial bites.

86
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,360
There's one of those.
And then the,

87
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,530
these big dominant
predators are a cephalopod,

88
00:04:35,531 --> 00:04:38,500
not Deloitte or not allied cephalopods,
which are kind of the squid,

89
00:04:38,501 --> 00:04:43,100
like things that are stuffed into these
giant ice cream cones and they would

90
00:04:43,101 --> 00:04:45,330
have eaten trilobites and
all sorts of other stuff. Um,

91
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,520
so this is the Ordovician world.
It's a very alien world.

92
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:53,170
And at the end of the Ordovician, the
shallow seas where a lot of these things,

93
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,123
um,

94
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:58,150
lived basically disappeared because you
suddenly go into this huge ice age and

95
00:04:58,151 --> 00:04:59,530
the sea level drops by hundreds of feet.

96
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,800
You destroy all this habitat
on top of the continents. Um,

97
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,900
but even things in the deep go extinct.

98
00:05:04,901 --> 00:05:08,560
And that might be because the ice age
changed the circulation of the ocean and

99
00:05:08,561 --> 00:05:12,390
change the oxygenation. And so you're
destroying a lot of habitat, uh,

100
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:17,050
thanksgiving, pretty bleak. Um, the
reason why you go into an ice age,

101
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:21,010
just thoughts that CO2 was sort
of dwindling over the Ordovician.

102
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,520
I'm to the point where when it reached
this threshold where then you go into

103
00:05:24,521 --> 00:05:26,670
this huge ice age,
uh,

104
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,470
today we're worried about Sia to going
up too fast and getting really warm.

105
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:33,710
But I've thought opposite thing happens.
You know, it can get very cold. Um,

106
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,770
the reasons why CO2 is
declining or debated.

107
00:05:35,771 --> 00:05:38,860
But one of the ideas is that
you can't really see it here,

108
00:05:38,861 --> 00:05:42,220
but the Appalachians are starting to form.
Um,

109
00:05:42,221 --> 00:05:45,070
they would have been this huge volcanic
mountain range in the tropics that

110
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,110
would've been eroding really fast.

111
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,720
And for some reasons we
don't have to get into.

112
00:05:49,721 --> 00:05:51,940
That'd be a really good way of
sequestering. A lot of Sio two.

113
00:05:51,941 --> 00:05:53,260
So this is kind of a weird extinction.

114
00:05:53,261 --> 00:05:55,880
It doesn't really have much
to do with the other ones. Um,

115
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:01,190
so then we'll just jump forward this about
70 million years to the late Devonian

116
00:06:01,191 --> 00:06:03,860
mass extinction when three
quarters of life goes extinct.

117
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,710
The Devonian is an interesting
time because it's actually,

118
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:09,980
there's a period of about 15 to 20 million
years where you have just pulses of

119
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:14,360
extinction where the ocean seems to keep
losing it's oxygen for some reason. Um,

120
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,740
but so as I said, it's a really, it's a,

121
00:06:18,741 --> 00:06:20,930
it's also a really transitional
period for life on earth.

122
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,690
As I said before in the Ordovician,
there wasn't much plant life.

123
00:06:23,691 --> 00:06:26,000
There were no trees in the Devonian.

124
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,330
Suddenly plant life is sort of taking off.

125
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,800
Trees suddenly evolve and they're sort of
invading the continence. Interestingly,

126
00:06:33,801 --> 00:06:38,030
the first fossil trees or forest that
we know of on the planet were found in

127
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:42,200
upstate New York. Uh, when they acquiring
a dam to make a New York City reservoir,

128
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:44,270
it's this thing called
the Gilboa fossil forest.

129
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:47,990
But today you can't go there because
it's behind the protection of the State

130
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,250
Department of environmental protection.
So it's kind of a bummer. But, um,

131
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,290
the motivation was the seat without fish.

132
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:57,590
By the late Devonian renown this
period called the age of fishes.

133
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,140
There's this huge array of really bizarre
fishes. Um, this thing is a plaque dorm,

134
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:05,120
which there are other platforms
that look totally different,

135
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:06,650
but this one was sort of the top predator.

136
00:07:06,651 --> 00:07:11,600
It had this sort of guillotine like mouth,
kind of a crazy scary animal.

137
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,650
These things have actually been invoked
for why our fish ancestors decided to

138
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:19,370
come onto land. Basically
they are terrified of things
that look like this. Um,

139
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:24,440
and then so also in the oceans you have
the largest coral reefs in the history

140
00:07:24,441 --> 00:07:28,130
of life on earth, they would have been 10
times the extent of modern coral reefs.

141
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,070
And in the late Devonian extinction,
um,

142
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,380
99.99% of them disappear.
These things get hammered. Um,

143
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:39,020
it's a really bleak time and like I said,

144
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:42,550
an Oxi or the ocean losing its oxygen
is thought to be one of the big kill

145
00:07:42,551 --> 00:07:43,850
mechanisms for this extinction.

146
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:47,120
And it's a similar thing
happens in our world today. Um,

147
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,970
so I don't know if you guys saw this,
but earlier this summer,

148
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:52,850
the largest dead zone ever and the
Gulf of Mexico was measured. Um,

149
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,570
this is sort of a seasonal
phenomenon in the summer when, um,

150
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,670
the Gulf of Mexico basically loses oxygen
over a huge area and it's horrible for

151
00:08:01,671 --> 00:08:02,820
fishermen.
Uh,

152
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,170
you have these sort of tides wash and all
these dead fish and the Gulf coast. Um,

153
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:11,000
and the reason why this happens is
because in the middle of the country,

154
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:15,710
when we spread in industrial agriculture,
when we spread fertilizer on our crops,

155
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,480
rich in nitrogen and phosphorous,

156
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:21,490
it washes into the Mississippi and then
out into the Gulf of Mexico where it

157
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,200
fuels these huge plankton
blooms that when they die,

158
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:28,100
they take up all the oxygen in the water
and sort of kill everything else. Um,

159
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,650
so something like this is
going on in the Devonian, um,

160
00:08:30,651 --> 00:08:32,030
only on a much larger scale.

161
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:36,140
And since there is no industrial
agriculture that we know of going on the

162
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:39,510
Devonian, um, one of the, uh,

163
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,220
reasons invoked for this is actually that
it might've been the trees themselves,

164
00:08:43,221 --> 00:08:47,120
which is, it's kind of interesting that
one of the things trees do is they,

165
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,950
they break down rock,
um,

166
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:52,820
and they create soils and when you
have trees just suddenly invade in the

167
00:08:52,821 --> 00:08:53,654
continents,

168
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,610
they would in breaking down a ton of
creating a ton of soils and sort of

169
00:08:56,611 --> 00:09:00,380
liberating all these things
like phosphorus that we
sprayed on our crops a day

170
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:03,690
would have washed into rivers and then
out into the oceans and might've caused

171
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:05,890
these huge anoxic events.
Um,

172
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,830
and when notions went and Auc
sec and all these things died,

173
00:09:10,831 --> 00:09:14,520
they fell to the bottom of the ocean and
over hundreds of millions years became

174
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:16,740
black shale. And this is actually
the stuff we fracked today.

175
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,980
This is from Lake Erie. There's
exposures to some of this black shale,

176
00:09:19,981 --> 00:09:24,300
but a lot of the stuff that we've been
fracking in the last few years is sort of

177
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:27,090
dead sea life from the Devonian mass
extinctions, which is kind of interesting.

178
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:31,440
And actually the extinction itself
is in this picture. It's, well it's,

179
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:35,430
it's in there, but it's one
of those boundaries. Okay.

180
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,680
So more than a hundred
million years later,

181
00:09:37,681 --> 00:09:39,210
we have the end Permian mass extinction.

182
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,180
This is the worst thing that has ever
happened in the history of life on earth.

183
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,080
This is kind of the all is lost
moment for planet earth. Um,

184
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,120
something like 90 to 96%
of species go extinct. Uh,

185
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,970
coral reefs have recovered at this point,
but at the end Permian,

186
00:09:53,971 --> 00:09:58,890
they are totally destroyed and basically
replaced by bacterial slime of the sort

187
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:01,500
that you don't really see in the fossil
record since before there was animal

188
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:05,200
life. But suddenly it kind of shows up
all over the place in the Permian. Um,

189
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:09,390
in the fossil record,
you see things like, um,

190
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,110
there's sort of these weird things that
look like fungal spores right at the

191
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:14,370
extinction all over the planet.

192
00:10:14,371 --> 00:10:17,760
And people have said that maybe this is
sort of a signature of things just like

193
00:10:17,761 --> 00:10:19,710
rotting everywhere.
Um,

194
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,750
co trees disappear from the fossil record
for we can't find them for maybe 10

195
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:29,190
million years after this. It's
incredibly bleak. Um, and so,

196
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:33,010
but this is the setting that it took
place and we are now in Pangea, which, um,

197
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:34,260
I'm sure some of you have heard of.

198
00:10:34,261 --> 00:10:38,400
It's his time when all the continents
were United in sort of this big sea, um,

199
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:42,750
shaped thing. And so North America is
attached to Africa and their stuff.

200
00:10:42,751 --> 00:10:44,220
America and Asia is kind of up there.

201
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,370
You can see it's kind of deserty
and bleak and some parts.

202
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:51,480
And in the continental interior of
Pangea might've gotten really extreme.

203
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,510
There's evidence from Kansas that parts
of the interior of the continent was

204
00:10:54,511 --> 00:10:57,210
like 160 degree degrees
Fahrenheit or something like that.

205
00:10:57,211 --> 00:11:00,600
But there are places where life is happy
and at the end of the primary we have

206
00:11:00,601 --> 00:11:03,780
this sort of happy ecosystem that
doesn't know that the end of the world is

207
00:11:03,781 --> 00:11:08,550
coming. But, um, on land, the top
Predator are things that look like this.

208
00:11:08,551 --> 00:11:12,810
This is a cool artist
representation of a therapsid, um,

209
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,390
which was sort of the, uh, uh,

210
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,750
Predator lineage of this larger
group of animals called synapses.

211
00:11:18,751 --> 00:11:22,500
So these also some of these
look like bigs, rhinoceros
sort of things with tusks.

212
00:11:22,501 --> 00:11:25,860
And um,
there were also these big warty reptiles.

213
00:11:25,861 --> 00:11:28,860
And this picture actually makes
this guy look kind of cool,

214
00:11:28,861 --> 00:11:31,240
but you look at other representations
of animals from this period and it does,

215
00:11:31,241 --> 00:11:34,980
it's not really the most photogenic
time for planet earth. Um,

216
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,460
and then in the oceans, this is a
picture of the ocean from the Permian.

217
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,660
This is the Guadalupe mountain
range in West Texas. Um,

218
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:47,060
which if you hike it and you look
at the rocks you're stepping on,

219
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:50,070
you can see that it's basically
just made out of a giant reef.

220
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:52,500
The whole thing is basically fossils.
Um,

221
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:55,990
and it gives one of the best examples
of what life was like in the oceans,

222
00:11:55,991 --> 00:11:59,680
in the Permian. And if you go to the
Permian Basin Petroleum Museum in Midland,

223
00:11:59,681 --> 00:12:01,270
Texas, like I did, uh,

224
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,080
you can see this cool display of what
these reefs would have looked like. Um,

225
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:10,320
and cause see, life was very happy
in Texas, in the Permian. Uh,

226
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:14,950
eventually that died and was buried and
much later made some people very rich

227
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,640
and powerful. And in the Permian Basin
Petroleum Museum has a hall of fame there.

228
00:12:18,641 --> 00:12:23,320
Then includes two of our presidents,
which is kind of cool. Um, anyways,

229
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:28,570
uh, so for a long time people want it
to, I mean obviously people were wanting,

230
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,080
we're curious why did earth almost
go extinct at the Permian? And,

231
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,000
um, knowing that a huge
asteroid is associated with
the later extinction of the

232
00:12:37,001 --> 00:12:38,610
dinosaurs, which I'll get to, um,

233
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:43,120
geologists aware of that came to this
extinction other early extinctions looking

234
00:12:43,121 --> 00:12:47,410
for evidence of asteroid impacts in the
fossil record. Things like, um, you know,

235
00:12:47,411 --> 00:12:51,880
a crater big enough to account for all
the devastation or a layer of asteroid

236
00:12:51,881 --> 00:12:55,100
dust and the false record and
they couldn't find it, um,

237
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,600
which came as kind of a surprise.
And,

238
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:02,550
but what they did find is that this huge
area of Russia that's outlined here, um,

239
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,210
is known as the Siberian traps.

240
00:13:04,211 --> 00:13:08,230
And it's basically all entirely made out
of ancient lava. And when it was dated,

241
00:13:08,231 --> 00:13:11,050
it dates precisely to the
Permian mass extinction.

242
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,370
Here's actually a picture from, from
you guys of what this area looks like.

243
00:13:15,371 --> 00:13:20,371
And you can see the sort of dull brown
sort of stuff is basically just the

244
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:24,070
ancient lava. Um, and if you
go there, which I haven't,

245
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,840
but this is what it looks like.

246
00:13:25,841 --> 00:13:29,200
It's just kind of these sweeping
plateaus of ancient lava.

247
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,620
Enough lava erupted at the end of the
Permian that it could have covered the

248
00:13:32,621 --> 00:13:37,540
lower 48 United States a kilometer
deep, um, which is just mind blowing.

249
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:41,020
Um, people talk about Yellowstone
is sort of this apocalyptic thing,

250
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:44,460
but if yellow stone went
off, it would cover, um,

251
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,750
a few states and a few inches of ash.

252
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,860
Enough lava here erupted to cover the
whole United States a kilometer deep.

253
00:13:50,861 --> 00:13:54,610
So this really is a truly
outrageous event. Um,

254
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,440
this might be something what it looked
like. These are fissure eruptions, um,

255
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:03,880
but since as extreme as it was,
it really only covered part of Russia.

256
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,190
So that can really explain why almost
everything on the planet goes extinct,

257
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,570
even if it's on the
other side of the world.

258
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:11,170
And so with geologist actually think
that it was the gasses that came out of

259
00:14:11,171 --> 00:14:11,921
these volcanoes,

260
00:14:11,921 --> 00:14:16,180
that where the the kill mechanism for
most life on earth and the most important

261
00:14:16,181 --> 00:14:21,100
of those gases would have been, or it's
argued, would have been carbon dioxide.

262
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:21,940
Uh,

263
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:25,000
we know the volcano's would've been
capable of producing incredible amounts of

264
00:14:25,001 --> 00:14:28,600
carbon dioxide and you can see signatures
of that and the rocks and it gets

265
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,220
incredibly hot.
Uh,

266
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:34,270
at the mass extinction when paleontologist
told me that oceans in the tropics

267
00:14:34,271 --> 00:14:38,170
would have been the temperature
of hot soup, um, and when,

268
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,470
uh,
sea water reacts with the Carbon Dioxide,

269
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,920
it makes it more acidic and it makes it
harder for things that calcify there,

270
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:46,840
like build their
skeletons to stick around.

271
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,830
And so a carbon ocean acidification is
thought to be a major kill mechanism in

272
00:14:50,831 --> 00:14:55,250
this mass extinction too. So those
reefs I showed you totally disappear.

273
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:59,900
Um, this guy totally
disappears. Um, interestingly,

274
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,060
he is on our side of the family tree.

275
00:15:02,061 --> 00:15:04,040
If these things are called
mammal like reptiles,

276
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:08,770
so something in this and this branch
eventually becomes mammals. Um,

277
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:12,050
but these, these guys all
get wiped out. Uh, but our,

278
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,150
our ancestor must've made it through,
or else we wouldn't be here.

279
00:15:14,151 --> 00:15:17,090
And it might have looked something
like this weaselly little guy called

280
00:15:17,091 --> 00:15:20,990
Thrinaxodon, which somehow makes
it through this extinction.

281
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,630
So that's the end Permian. Um,
amazingly and the next, you know,

282
00:15:26,631 --> 00:15:30,410
tens of millions of years, life recovers
and there's 25 million years later.

283
00:15:30,411 --> 00:15:33,560
Dinosaurs evolve.
True mammals come around,

284
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:38,390
a crocodile ancestors come around
and coral reefs bounce back,

285
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,770
but then 50 million years later,

286
00:15:39,771 --> 00:15:43,190
basically the exact same thing
happens at the end Triassic. Um,

287
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:46,610
80% of species go extinct.
And it's basically the same thing,

288
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:49,330
just sort of a mini version of
the end. Permian. There's a,

289
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,650
the earth sort of opens up and there's
another one of these crazy volcanic

290
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:55,010
events.
So this is the slide for the Permian,

291
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:57,470
but the world wouldn't have looked that
much different except for the fact that

292
00:15:57,471 --> 00:16:00,440
North America would have started
to be pulling away from Africa.

293
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,680
And you would get this, uh,
system of riff valley lakes there.

294
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:07,590
And here's a picture of one. This
is in Connecticut actually, uh,

295
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:11,660
about 210 million years ago. And you
could see they're dinosaurs now. Um,

296
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,620
but dinosaurs actually are
not the dominant animal on
in the world this point.

297
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:20,540
Um, it's actually this branch of
crocodile relative, so you can see,

298
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,640
you can see one of them here and some
of them would have looked like things

299
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,840
would recognize as crocodiles,

300
00:16:23,841 --> 00:16:26,540
but some of these animals are
really strange somewhere. Um,

301
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,340
plant eaters that ran around on two legs.

302
00:16:28,341 --> 00:16:32,360
And so there's this whole kind of
weird world of crocodiles, relatives.

303
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:36,140
Here's one called the Carolina butcher
that they found a year or two ago outside

304
00:16:36,141 --> 00:16:38,030
of Raleigh, North Carolina. Um,

305
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:40,790
so you can see how these things sort of
would have been the dominant animal on

306
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,730
the planet and the dinosaurs really
needed these things to get wiped out in a

307
00:16:43,731 --> 00:16:47,390
mass extinction to take over.
And the next stage, so this is,

308
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:50,180
this is another picture of the ocean.
Uh, this is the Australian Alps,

309
00:16:50,181 --> 00:16:51,014
which are almost,

310
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:56,030
or which are in large part made out of
coral reefs from the Triassic modern core

311
00:16:56,301 --> 00:17:00,050
Reese evolve and sort of have this huge
blossoming but then are totally wiped

312
00:17:00,051 --> 00:17:01,010
out in the mass extinction.

313
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:04,040
You can't really find corals for hundreds
of thousands to millions of years

314
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:08,780
after this extinction. Um, and so
for a lot, for a decade or two ago,

315
00:17:08,781 --> 00:17:13,760
people thought they knew what
sort of, um, killed everything.

316
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:18,830
And it is, it was this crater that's in
Quebec, which is about 62 miles wide.

317
00:17:18,831 --> 00:17:20,240
This is another picture
I took from Google maps.

318
00:17:20,241 --> 00:17:23,780
If you just go sort of a little northwest
of Maine over the Saint Lawrence River,

319
00:17:23,781 --> 00:17:26,990
you'll find this giant
circular system of lakes. Um,

320
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,940
and people knew it was around
the time of the extinction.

321
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,160
The problem is the
Triassic mass extinction.

322
00:17:31,161 --> 00:17:34,970
It was 201 million years old or years ago.
And when they did this,

323
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,650
they found it was 214 million years old.

324
00:17:36,651 --> 00:17:41,651
So this kind of came as a surprise because
it seems like this massive asteroid

325
00:17:42,021 --> 00:17:45,440
hit that had been calculated should
kill at least a third of life on earth

326
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:50,400
struck during a period when it seems
like life was pretty happy and not at the

327
00:17:50,401 --> 00:17:51,450
time of the mass extinction.

328
00:17:51,451 --> 00:17:55,370
So at this kind of came as a
surprise to geologists who, um,

329
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:59,780
it sort of made them rethink just how
deadly asteroids have been in earth

330
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,290
history.
Uh,

331
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:05,640
this is a picture from on top of what
actually was the kill mechanism of the

332
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,550
entrust mass extinction.
So that's us in the background,

333
00:18:08,551 --> 00:18:13,070
but this picture is from on top
of the New Jersey Palisades, um,

334
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:17,790
just over the George Washington Bridge
and the New Jersey Palisades are just

335
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,230
like the Siberian traps,

336
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:24,000
this huge expanse of ancient magma.
Um,

337
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,230
these would have been underground,

338
00:18:25,231 --> 00:18:28,470
but they would have been feeding
eruptions and New Jersey to the west.

339
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:33,770
But you can find the same rock data
to the exact same time in Nova Scotia,

340
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:37,970
Brazil, Spain, Morocco, and
it all comes out right at the,

341
00:18:37,971 --> 00:18:39,380
at the traffic mass extinctions.

342
00:18:39,381 --> 00:18:42,110
So it's another one of these
insane volcanic events, um,

343
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,970
would have covered 3 million
square miles and lava. But again,

344
00:18:44,971 --> 00:18:48,210
it's thought that these gasses that came
out of it really did the did in life

345
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,430
135 million years later. We have the most
famous mass extinction ever. Um, this,

346
00:18:53,431 --> 00:18:55,770
the end Cretaceous is the one
that everyone's familiar with, uh,

347
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:58,400
66 million years ago.
Um,

348
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,750
all the non bird dinosaurs go extinct.
Um, we still have bird dinosaurs around.

349
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:07,590
Um, but all these iconic
species that people know about,

350
00:19:07,591 --> 00:19:11,240
like t rex and triceratops, all are, are,

351
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:15,060
are there at doomsday and sort of
all the big dinosaurs go extinct,

352
00:19:15,061 --> 00:19:16,050
but it's not just dinosaurs.

353
00:19:16,051 --> 00:19:18,750
There's tons of other cool stuff
on the planet that goes extinct.

354
00:19:18,751 --> 00:19:22,250
This is actually also the biggest mass
extinction in the history of mammals. Um,

355
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:26,580
they, they make it through, but it
also, nothing really escapes the,

356
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:32,190
the sort of sky of extinction
here, um, in the ocean.

357
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:35,790
Uh, these, this, this, uh,
artist rendition of an ammonite,

358
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,910
things like this had been swimming in the
ocean for 300 million years and all of

359
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:41,340
them disappear at this extinction.
Um,

360
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,910
we also have these sort of giant
terrifying marine reptiles.

361
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:48,930
It's like a,
this is a picture of a Mosasaur skeleton.

362
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,330
People think of these as
sort of aquatic dinosaurs,

363
00:19:51,331 --> 00:19:53,670
but these were evolved
on a different lineage.

364
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,890
They evolved out of things that look
like monitor lizards or snakes. Um,

365
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,920
and similarly you have pterosaurs these
crazy giant flying reptiles that also

366
00:20:01,921 --> 00:20:02,581
aren't dinosaurs,

367
00:20:02,581 --> 00:20:06,460
but you can see here some of them got
to be the size of like small plants. Um,

368
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,420
and those all go extinct too.
So lots of cool stuff goes extinct.

369
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:14,640
This extinction I think has produced
the best Paleo are in my opinion. Um,

370
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,220
this is a painting of a t rex literally
staring down the asteroid, um,

371
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,370
which is pretty epic.

372
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:25,380
And I'm in this picture you see some
Pterosaurus flying by what must be the

373
00:20:25,381 --> 00:20:29,670
Yucatan peninsula. Um, but this, this, uh,

374
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:30,830
this painting might actually,

375
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:34,680
this might have actually sort of been an
impossible seen cause I asked an impact

376
00:20:34,681 --> 00:20:37,560
modeler, uh, what it would've looked
like if you had seen the impact.

377
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,100
And he said that the question didn't
really make sense because if you're close

378
00:20:41,101 --> 00:20:45,600
enough to see the impact, you'd
be dead instantly. Basically,

379
00:20:45,601 --> 00:20:47,130
he'd just be set on fire and you go blind.

380
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,140
There's so much energy
released in optical wavelength.

381
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,470
So it was a really pretty extreme event.
And they're,

382
00:20:52,471 --> 00:20:56,950
the reason why we know there was an
asteroid impact is that in 1980, uh,

383
00:20:56,951 --> 00:20:57,970
Walter Alvarez and his dad,

384
00:20:57,971 --> 00:21:01,360
Louis Alvarez at UC Berkeley announced
in a paper that they had found

385
00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:05,890
essentially a layer of
asteroid dust between more or
less the layers between the

386
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:09,610
age of dinosaurs in age of mammals.
And then a decade or so later,

387
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:14,410
a paleontologist identified this hundred
10 mile crater in the Yucatan peninsula.

388
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:19,210
That's, um, it's underground.
So it's that, which is why
it evaded them for so long.

389
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:24,070
But it was actually founder first in
the 70s by geophysicists working for a

390
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,940
Mexican oil company. Um, but it,

391
00:21:27,941 --> 00:21:29,770
and it was found a thousand years earlier,

392
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:34,090
interestingly by Mayan civilization
sort of unwittingly because, um,

393
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:37,540
the impact structure has actually created
all these limestone sinkholes that

394
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:41,560
provide fresh water. And
when mind civilization sort
of sprouted up around this,

395
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:41,890
uh,

396
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:45,700
these freshwater sinkholes and unwittingly
sort of created this hundred 10 mile

397
00:21:45,701 --> 00:21:49,720
ring that marks the asteroid
crater that killed the dinosaurs.

398
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,310
Uh,

399
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:56,310
I visited Mexico and that's called the
Chicxulub crater because the epicenter is

400
00:21:56,381 --> 00:22:00,930
this coastal town called chicks Solu.
I'm on the Yucatan peninsula. Um,

401
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:04,300
and I went there and I would argue this
is the most important event in the last

402
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,530
a hundred billion years.
And this is the only memorial to it,

403
00:22:05,531 --> 00:22:07,960
which is kind of sad.
Um,

404
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:11,940
the fly in the ointment of the asteroid,
uh,

405
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:15,820
explanation for this mass extinction is
that at the exact same time on the other

406
00:22:15,821 --> 00:22:20,440
side of the world in western India,
you have another one of these completely,

407
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,190
uh,

408
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:25,960
crazy volcanic events of continental
flood basalt where this time enough lava

409
00:22:25,961 --> 00:22:29,710
erupted to cover the lower 48 states
in 600 feet deep, a lava. So not quite.

410
00:22:29,711 --> 00:22:31,900
The Siberian traps was still
a crazy amount of lava.

411
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,070
And then in the last few years, as people
have gone back to date this law, the,

412
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,810
the Deccan traps they're called,
um,

413
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:43,810
the most voluminous period of the eruption
seems to be closer and closer to the

414
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,730
exact time of that mass extinction.

415
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:49,090
So it's been really interesting to watch
the last few years as these sorta two

416
00:22:49,091 --> 00:22:53,330
communities that have always worried
about whether the relative importance of

417
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:57,970
the asteroid impact versus the volcanoes
have sort of this more complex holistic

418
00:22:57,971 --> 00:23:02,860
picture of, um, sort of a ecosystem going
on for all sorts of horrible reasons,

419
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,430
um, is emerging. And so just to recap, uh,

420
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:10,570
we know a giant asteroid hit at the end
of the Cretaceous for one of these mass

421
00:23:10,571 --> 00:23:13,600
extinctions as far as we can tell,

422
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:17,260
we can't find evidence of a major impact
at the end Triassic the end Permian,

423
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:21,610
late Devonian or the endo
division. On the other hand, um,

424
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,410
there are major asteroid impacts of
time when Earth seems relatively happy.

425
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:31,930
Uh, and then we do know that there
were major volcanic events at the end,

426
00:23:31,931 --> 00:23:36,790
Triassic and Permian. I didn't
mention it, but, uh, there is, uh,

427
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:40,300
another one of these big
volcanic provinces that's
been dated sometime around

428
00:23:40,301 --> 00:23:43,210
the late Devonian mass extinction.
Um, it hasn't been data precisely,

429
00:23:43,211 --> 00:23:45,500
but it's close enough to sort
of certainly raise eyebrows.

430
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:48,170
And then crazily enough, there's
also one at the end. Cretaceous.

431
00:23:48,171 --> 00:23:49,400
So this seems like these,

432
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:53,080
this seems to be a theme of
mass extinctions and then
we have an ice age and,

433
00:23:53,081 --> 00:23:56,000
and Ordovician and some weird stuff
going on with trees in the late Devonian.

434
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,373
To summarize,

435
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:02,090
these volcanoes would have brought their
destruction by extreme global warming.

436
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:04,040
Uh,
I don't expect anyone to understand this,

437
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:06,110
but if you go to geology conferences,

438
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:09,770
you'll see slides like this lot where
people have analyzed limestones and you

439
00:24:09,771 --> 00:24:13,100
could tell it from the oxygen
isotopes that it gets incredibly warm.

440
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,590
And you can tell from the carbon I still
ups that there's a huge injection of

441
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,040
like carbon that's driving the warming.
Um, so this is for the Permian.

442
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:21,320
It's pretty unintelligible,

443
00:24:21,321 --> 00:24:26,321
but so there's evidence of extreme global
warming driven by Sia too and ocean

444
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:30,850
acidification and ocean anoxia,
um,

445
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,010
which we see today or thoughts thought
to be major kill mechanisms and these

446
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,050
mass extinctions.
Um,

447
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:39,830
and this is concerning because modern
notions of become 30% more acidic since

448
00:24:39,831 --> 00:24:44,300
the industrial revolution, uh, this
is already affecting a shellfish.

449
00:24:44,301 --> 00:24:47,540
Growers in the Pacific northwest are
having trouble growing oysters around

450
00:24:47,541 --> 00:24:50,020
Antarctica.
And also in the Pacific northwest,

451
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:53,510
you see certain types of plankton are
starting to dissolve because the water's

452
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:56,360
becoming more acidic. There's less
carbonate to build their skeletons.

453
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:57,920
And by the end of the century,

454
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:01,370
if we do anything like
business as usual emissions,

455
00:25:01,371 --> 00:25:04,000
this stuff's gonna get really
grizzly with coal research,

456
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:08,120
expect it to basically disappear by
the end of the century. And Anoxia,

457
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:11,270
which is a major kill mechanism
as I explained in the Devonian,

458
00:25:11,271 --> 00:25:14,990
is also spreading a modern notions from
nutrient pollution from agriculture,

459
00:25:14,991 --> 00:25:19,160
but also warming makes it worse. Um, so
as I said, Arianna sixth mass extinction,

460
00:25:19,161 --> 00:25:20,960
this is the question that
people are talking about now.

461
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:25,070
And I would say if we are in one,
then it started a long time ago. Uh,

462
00:25:25,071 --> 00:25:28,970
there's sort of this eerie shadow that's
followed humans as they enter Luton,

463
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:32,600
new land masses over the last few
tens of thousands of years, um,

464
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:36,980
where all the large animal sorta
go extinct, uh, where they are.

465
00:25:36,981 --> 00:25:38,990
So 50 to 60,000 years ago,

466
00:25:38,991 --> 00:25:43,760
people showed up in Australia and shortly
thereafter you lose everything over a

467
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:43,761
hundred kilograms,

468
00:25:43,761 --> 00:25:48,440
you lose these giant wombats that
would have been the size of cows and a

469
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:53,100
marsupial lions and monitor lizards that
would have been 15 to 20 feet long. Um,

470
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:56,210
and then 12,000 years ago around,
um,

471
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:59,540
we lose all red rom and humans
are showing up in North America.

472
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:03,650
We lose all of what we think of as I
sage fauna, things like woolly mammoths,

473
00:26:03,651 --> 00:26:07,520
mastodons, camels ground,
sloths, all sorts of crazy stuff.

474
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:10,790
And then right up to the present day and
the past few centuries is people have

475
00:26:10,791 --> 00:26:14,560
made these epic voyages across the
Pacific to tiny islands. They've, um,

476
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,060
uh, you know, you lose these big
flightless birds and land snails.

477
00:26:20,061 --> 00:26:23,360
And I switched stuff too.
Now modern industrial society,

478
00:26:23,361 --> 00:26:25,970
we're really kind of our foot on the gas.
Um,

479
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:30,230
it's a picture of an industry or
a shrimp fishing boat, but, um,

480
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:35,450
industrial fishing. Every year we bought
trawl basically just plow over an area,

481
00:26:35,451 --> 00:26:38,150
the sea floor,
twice the size of the continental us.

482
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:42,860
And there's a picture of a shrimp,
what trim boats typically pull up,

483
00:26:42,861 --> 00:26:46,430
which is 90% of the stuff they pull up
isn't shrimp. They, it's called bycatch,

484
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,740
which is just other fish and sea turtles
and stuff and they pull out the shrimp.

485
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:52,950
So there's huge wastes in our,
in our fishing techniques today.

486
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,050
And we also deforest a ton of stuff.

487
00:26:55,051 --> 00:26:58,650
This is a satellite picture of the Amazon
merger sort of made in roads and are

488
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,350
breaking up habitat and things like that.
So,

489
00:27:01,351 --> 00:27:05,010
so far our interacts with the environment
to the extent that it's been negative

490
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,540
has really been through
direct interaction.

491
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:10,350
It's been through hunting and
destroying habitat and things like that.

492
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,880
And I think if we just sort of relented
and let nature sort of go back, um,

493
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:17,250
it nature,
nature is incredibly resilient.

494
00:27:17,251 --> 00:27:20,400
I think a lot of these ecosystems
would bounce back and, um,

495
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:23,160
we could avoid sort of the worst.

496
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:27,300
The problem is that in the
next few centuries or next
few decades to centuries,

497
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:31,920
um, we're really going to start messing
with the chemistry of the oceans and the

498
00:27:31,921 --> 00:27:35,040
atmosphere in a way that has only really
happened a few times in the history of

499
00:27:35,041 --> 00:27:37,950
the planet. And when it has, it's
been really pretty devastating.

500
00:27:37,951 --> 00:27:41,160
So this is what a healthy
coral reef looks like. Um,

501
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:46,700
but based on just sort of business as
usual and even some aggressive, uh,

502
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:48,240
CO2 reduction scenarios,

503
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:52,170
ocean acidification is thought to destroy
most coral reefs the second half of

504
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:56,190
this century. Um, so
this is what a high CO2,

505
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,720
slightly warmer ocean looks like.

506
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,180
This is probably what coral reefs
looked like at the end of the Permian.

507
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:06,120
As one ecologists put it, we're on a
slippery slope to slime. Um, so that's,

508
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:09,660
that's all the bad news and that it
can seem pretty overwhelming and pretty

509
00:28:09,661 --> 00:28:10,494
depressing.

510
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,820
The good news is that we still
have tons of biodiversity to save.

511
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:16,640
So earlier I said it,

512
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:19,230
it might be debatable whether
we're in a sixth mass extinction.

513
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:24,231
And the reason is that so far our best
estimates is that less than 1% of species

514
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:27,570
have gone extinct in the
last few hundred years. Um,

515
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:31,440
so when you compare that to an event
like the permanent, when it's 90, 96%,

516
00:28:31,441 --> 00:28:34,680
clearly we have a long way to go until
we're in the same conversation as these

517
00:28:34,681 --> 00:28:39,300
worst events of all time. Uh, the bad
news is that a lot of these animals,

518
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:42,540
their populations are declining
and the range sizes are declining.

519
00:28:42,541 --> 00:28:45,810
And that's sort of the
first step to extinction.

520
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:49,740
And the best paper on this is by
a paleontologist at UC Berkeley,

521
00:28:49,741 --> 00:28:53,850
Anthony Barnosky. Um, it's
called, has this earth six
mass extinction arrived yet?

522
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:59,400
And his calculation was that if we keep
up our influence on the environment for

523
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:02,010
a few more centuries to millennia,

524
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:05,260
we could actually be in the
same conversation as um,

525
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,490
to five worse mass
extinctions of all time.

526
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:12,900
So I think the good news is that the
world hasn't ended yet and we can still

527
00:29:12,901 --> 00:29:16,470
save it. And we still have time to do
so, but we really have to act quickly.

528
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,100
And it's crazy that we could ever even
be in the same conversation as these

529
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:23,070
completely crazy events
when, um, you know,

530
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:26,820
and that giant asteroids hitting the same
time as India is getting buried in lab

531
00:29:26,821 --> 00:29:30,500
and stuff. The fact they were
even the same conversation,
it's kind of amazing. Um,

532
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:34,200
there's reasons to get discouraged based
on sort of our political climate now.

533
00:29:34,201 --> 00:29:34,770
But I would,

534
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:38,130
I would just say that it hasn't always
been the case that conservation and

535
00:29:38,131 --> 00:29:41,980
environmentalism and kind of stewardship
the environment has been a partisan

536
00:29:41,981 --> 00:29:44,680
issue. Um, completely. Uh,

537
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,400
I'd just like to remind people
that as recently as the George W.

538
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,220
Bush administration,
this is a picture of his,

539
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:55,260
him signing a Mac to protect
the northwest Hawaiian islands.

540
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:59,530
And at the time this was the largest
marine protected area in the world.

541
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,130
And hopefully we can start to,
I don't know,

542
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:08,260
think across party lines and agree that
we're all here and share the same planet

543
00:30:08,261 --> 00:30:12,760
and that we should, we should,
uh, do our best to do so. Um,

544
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:18,370
so are we in the sixth mass extinction
yet? I would say we don't have to be,

545
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:21,880
and there's still time to save the world.
So let's go out and do that.

546
00:30:21,881 --> 00:30:26,110
And just to finish, here's a cool
picture in New Mexico and at that,

547
00:30:26,111 --> 00:30:26,944
thank you Google.

548
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:31,660
[inaudible]

549
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:34,930
oh, we're just going to kick off with a
few questions and I'll open it up to you

550
00:30:34,931 --> 00:30:39,040
all. Um, so wow. Interesting stuff.

551
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:43,210
And I like how you have some hope there,
which is great. There's still time.

552
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:47,830
So tell me, what was your initial
inspiration for this book? I mean, what,

553
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:51,780
what started the appeal to
investigate all this? Well,

554
00:30:51,781 --> 00:30:55,780
there were a couple of things.
One was sort of just like any kid,

555
00:30:55,781 --> 00:30:58,410
I loved Jurassic Park and stuff like that.
And I've,

556
00:30:58,411 --> 00:31:01,660
I've always been obsessed with dinosaurs
and I've made a point to keep in touch,

557
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:05,830
keep in touch with the extinction
literature in my whole life. So I've read,

558
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:10,000
Walter Alvarez wrote a book called t rocks
and the crater of doom. And then, uh,

559
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:14,000
this other paleontologist Peter Ward
wrote a book called under green sky. Um,

560
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,300
and that was kind of the first time
I'd heard that carbon dioxide might be

561
00:31:16,301 --> 00:31:19,450
involved with some of these
other mass extinctions. But, um,

562
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:22,660
I was also writing a lot about the oceans
and when you write about the oceans,

563
00:31:22,661 --> 00:31:27,080
as you can see there at the end, it can
get pretty depressing. Um, and then I,

564
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:31,630
I started to learn the story from a
geologists that some of the changes that

565
00:31:31,631 --> 00:31:35,200
we're seeing today have actually
happened in our sister each. Um,

566
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,890
which to me was fascinating because you
kind of hear the story of climate change

567
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:42,000
and what we're doing to the planet as
something that's sort of simulated on

568
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:45,100
computer models. And I thought
this was so cool that, um,

569
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:48,280
the earth's kind of run this experiment
and sort of extreme ways, um,

570
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:52,030
and we can actually just go back and
consult earth history to find out, uh,

571
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,360
what happened.
Um,

572
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:57,910
and I also thought there was this sort
of unknown or not it had been told,

573
00:31:57,911 --> 00:32:01,390
but I felt like the,
the message could use some amplification,

574
00:32:01,391 --> 00:32:03,820
which is that in the public imagination,

575
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:06,010
people associate mass
extinctions with asteroids.

576
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:10,180
That's partly because right after
that crater was discovered movies,

577
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,300
horrible movies like Armageddon
and deep impact came out.

578
00:32:13,301 --> 00:32:16,270
And so for most people they kind of
left it there and they think, okay,

579
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,550
mass extinctions are what
happened when asteroids hit.

580
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:21,550
And I had noticed that this cool
conversation was going on in the geology

581
00:32:21,551 --> 00:32:26,551
community over the last few decades where
we weren't able to find asteroids at

582
00:32:26,831 --> 00:32:31,730
the other mass extinctions. And it's
actually some of the same mechanisms, um,

583
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:34,750
in operation on the planet today or what,
what caused them.

584
00:32:34,751 --> 00:32:38,830
And so I thought there sort of a news
hook and it's also just fun to write about

585
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,220
and volcanoes

586
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,330
and stuff like that.
Nice.

587
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,650
And thanks for speeding up time and
taking us through the five mass extinction

588
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,750
of those.
Do you have a favorite

589
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,410
that changes?
It kind of changes a lot,

590
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:58,650
especially when I was writing the book.
Every,

591
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,440
every new extinction I would
really focus on. I was like,

592
00:33:01,441 --> 00:33:04,290
this is the most mind blowing
thing I've ever read. Um,

593
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:10,920
it might be the might be the Permian I
guess just cause it was so extreme. Um,

594
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:14,970
and it's,
I guess it's kind of,

595
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:18,830
it's not really out there in
the popular imagination, um,

596
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,370
the way it should be just cause it,

597
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,110
it's really what happens when you turn
all the dials up to their maximum level

598
00:33:25,111 --> 00:33:29,950
and try as hard as you can to kill
everything on the planet. Um, so I dunno,

599
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:34,530
it's also,
it might be too extreme of a,

600
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:37,680
it's kind of good news
because even with the Permian,

601
00:33:37,681 --> 00:33:41,610
which I don't know if we're capable of
reproducing, even if we do our worst,

602
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,390
um, one paleontologist told me I was the
best thing that's ever happened on earth

603
00:33:45,391 --> 00:33:48,120
because 20 million years later you have
dinosaurs and mammals and stuff like

604
00:33:48,121 --> 00:33:50,730
that and sort of this new
world blossoms afterwards.

605
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:55,680
So for me it was kind of amazing to sort
of learn how resilient the planet is.

606
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:58,530
Um, so yeah, I guess,

607
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,570
I guess the primary, and when people
say, so what killed the dinosaurs?

608
00:34:02,571 --> 00:34:05,660
I've heard you say they're not dead.
Tell us about that.

609
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:06,950
Yeah.
So,

610
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:12,050
as I said in the talk that
the bird dinosaurs are still
around and that's not a,

611
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:15,650
that's not just something
cute that paleontologists
say like birds are literally

612
00:34:15,651 --> 00:34:19,100
dinosaurs. If you look
at a skeleton of a, um,

613
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,450
like a t rex and a chicken
compared to a t rex stegosaurus,

614
00:34:23,451 --> 00:34:26,240
you can see that the first two
are way closer, closer cousins.

615
00:34:26,241 --> 00:34:28,260
Then the latter two.
Um,

616
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,880
and even like if you have a chicken wing,

617
00:34:31,881 --> 00:34:35,510
you can see there's this little
claw that comes up, call the,

618
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,010
I think it's called a Lula or something,

619
00:34:37,011 --> 00:34:40,160
but there's actually still dinosaur clause
and that's its thumb from a dinosaur

620
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:42,950
claw that eventually sort
of evolved to become a wing.

621
00:34:42,951 --> 00:34:45,320
So when you look at a
chicken and a chicken's eyes,

622
00:34:45,321 --> 00:34:49,880
you can tell it has this sort of like cold
Ref Tilian hello? So I don't, I don't,

623
00:34:49,881 --> 00:34:53,810
I think it's kind of obvious that they're
dinosaurs. That's great. All right, well

624
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:57,520
we want to open it up to the audience.
I'm sure the rest of the, uh,

625
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,990
Googlers have some questions.

626
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:04,410
One thing that I was hoping you can touch
a little bit on is towards the end of

627
00:35:04,411 --> 00:35:05,610
the book you talk about,
um,

628
00:35:05,611 --> 00:35:08,040
when you start talking about
humans and like the current state,

629
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:13,090
you talk about how humans have culture
and that's kind of what's tied into like

630
00:35:13,771 --> 00:35:15,330
why were so destructive.

631
00:35:15,331 --> 00:35:19,250
The idea of like propagating
information in ways of like,

632
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,510
I guess going about like
destroying things in the earth.

633
00:35:21,511 --> 00:35:22,860
And I was wondering if you can touch

634
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:27,590
yeah. And that, um, so a lot of people,
a lot of times people ask me like,

635
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:31,030
so when are humans going extinct? And, um,

636
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,220
a lot of paleontologists would tell you
that humans are incredibly existing,

637
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:38,510
extinction resistant. Um, and
that's because we have culture, um,

638
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:42,360
where other animal sort of have to wait
around for natural selection to kill

639
00:35:42,361 --> 00:35:43,730
them off.
Um,

640
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:47,160
and their information is sort of pass
through to the next generation haphazardly

641
00:35:47,161 --> 00:35:52,161
by whichever part of the population
is suited to the new environment.

642
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:56,610
Humans can adapt on the fly
by transmitting information
through language and

643
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:00,410
through books and things
like that. And, uh,

644
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,580
we can kind of get one
step ahead of evolution.

645
00:36:02,581 --> 00:36:07,581
So that has enabled us to
rapidly take over the planet and,

646
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,020
uh, cure diseases and all these
things that would have like,

647
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,740
we don't get killed by
lions that much anymore. Uh,

648
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:19,750
all these things that would sort of take
out other animals we can adapt to on

649
00:36:20,371 --> 00:36:24,810
the fly because we have this
incredibly, uh, adaptive,

650
00:36:24,811 --> 00:36:29,070
malleable information transmission
system that is much more powerful.

651
00:36:29,071 --> 00:36:33,300
You could argue the natural selection.
So I don't know if that's right.

652
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,480
Um, hi. Um,

653
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,590
in recent years we learned about the,

654
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:46,930
that we broke the limit of Sio two in the
atmosphere, the 400 parts per million.

655
00:36:46,931 --> 00:36:47,500
Yeah.

656
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:51,400
And it's considered kind of like a brake
line and that it may lead to what is

657
00:36:51,401 --> 00:36:56,401
called a cascade effect by the defrosting
of Siberia and more methane being

658
00:36:56,501 --> 00:36:57,760
released and so on and so forth.

659
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,570
Is that actually your deadline is,

660
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,620
or are we going to see something
like that in the next coming years?

661
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:07,760
So I know there,

662
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:11,420
there has been this fear for a long time
that we could destabilize these huge

663
00:37:11,421 --> 00:37:15,960
reservoir is a methane and kickoff this
like completely catastrophic warming. Um,

664
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:18,920
within a few decades. I think the
more people have looked into that,

665
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:22,880
it doesn't seem like these huge reserves
are capable of sort of a catastrophic

666
00:37:22,881 --> 00:37:27,660
destabilization, but certainly
over thousands of years, um,

667
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:31,010
the earth is going to get a lot
more warmer than it is today. Uh,

668
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:36,620
we know that the main driver of climate
for the last 60 million years or so is

669
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:39,530
the atmospheric concentration
of carbon dioxide.

670
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,400
And the last time it was 400
parts per million was the,

671
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:49,040
I think it was apply a scene.
Um, but we're expected when
sea level was, I dunno,

672
00:37:49,041 --> 00:37:52,130
it's like 30 meters or something
higher than us today. Uh,

673
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,650
so over thousands of years,

674
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:58,490
ice is going to keep melting and sea
level's going to go up and we're going to

675
00:37:58,491 --> 00:38:01,310
transition to this much warmer world.
Um,

676
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:05,390
whether or not it will take place on
a short enough time scale that'll be

677
00:38:05,391 --> 00:38:08,930
catastrophic to civilization, I
think is still an open question. Um,

678
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,950
but we're headed towards,
people talk about,

679
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:18,140
it could be five degrees
warmer, um, by the end of the
century and you think, okay,

680
00:38:18,141 --> 00:38:18,810
five degrees,

681
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:21,410
if that's not that big of a deal
last time it's five degrees warmer.

682
00:38:21,411 --> 00:38:23,910
There was no ice on Antarctica.
Um,

683
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,240
or at least in times of the past
when it's been five degrees warmer,

684
00:38:26,241 --> 00:38:30,980
there's no ice in Antarctica and we're
talking about going over a hundred parts

685
00:38:30,981 --> 00:38:31,850
per million co two.

686
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:35,040
And that brings you back to like
the eoscene when there were um,

687
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:37,450
palm trees in Alaska and stuff like that.

688
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:42,510
And so maybe in a few centuries to
millennia we might actually recreate that

689
00:38:43,001 --> 00:38:44,980
world,
but I think the next few centuries,

690
00:38:44,981 --> 00:38:46,870
or I mean the next few
decades there's going to be,

691
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:49,900
it'll get warmer and sea level go up.

692
00:38:49,901 --> 00:38:53,400
But I don't know if it would be quite
on a catastrophic. I mean it will be,

693
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:55,030
it could be,
it will be catastrophic,

694
00:38:55,031 --> 00:38:58,210
but Antarctica is not going
to melt completely tomorrow.

695
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:00,960
Thank you.
It was wondering,

696
00:39:00,961 --> 00:39:04,440
so if 86 or 90% of animals go extinct,

697
00:39:04,441 --> 00:39:06,060
so it's not 100%.

698
00:39:06,061 --> 00:39:10,410
So what are the retreats for those
little creatures then kind of survive?

699
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,710
Did they settle on mountain top?
So where did they go?

700
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:18,980
Yeah, so there's these theorize
things called Refugia, um,

701
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:24,440
where animals sort of waited out until
conditions get better and then they can

702
00:39:24,441 --> 00:39:26,600
flourish scan.
But that's sort of just a,

703
00:39:26,601 --> 00:39:29,540
a name that we've given to a
phenomenon we don't understand quite,

704
00:39:29,541 --> 00:39:30,590
it's sort of like dark matter.

705
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:34,080
It's like a placeholder because for the
most part we don't really know where the

706
00:39:34,081 --> 00:39:35,110
Refugio are,

707
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:39,170
but it's easy to make life really
miserable in certain parts of the planet,

708
00:39:39,171 --> 00:39:43,160
but it's very hard to wipe out everything
and every deep sea canyon and Mountain

709
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:47,150
Valley everywhere on the planet of
every size. And it's really hard to,

710
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:51,080
to wipe out all of life on earth.
It seems based on these mass extinctions.

711
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:55,280
I think it's in one of
the freakonomics books,

712
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:59,010
they talk about the scientists who,
um,

713
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:04,240
found that volcano eruptions bring down
the amount of co two in the atmosphere

714
00:40:04,431 --> 00:40:06,910
and like serve to kind of cool the planet.

715
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:10,340
There was this group of people who are
trying to make like these artificial

716
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:12,230
volcanic eruptions in Antarctica.

717
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:16,430
And so how do you reconcile that with
what you're saying before when you have

718
00:40:16,431 --> 00:40:19,880
these huge volcanic eruptions that brings
so much co two into the atmosphere and

719
00:40:19,881 --> 00:40:21,320
leaning to extreme heating?
Right.

720
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:23,670
So that's a good question
because there's probably,

721
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:27,660
people use the word super volcano at tuns
tends to mean a few different things.

722
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,300
Um, but yeah, explosive, uh,

723
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,980
sort of strata volcanoes that we see
around the planet today inject a lot of

724
00:40:34,981 --> 00:40:37,270
software aerosols that dim them,

725
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:41,250
reduce the amount of sunlight that can
come into the atmosphere and it makes it

726
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:45,000
cooler temporarily.
And that might have been a component.

727
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:48,570
There might've been short term cooling
and some of these mass extinctions. Um,

728
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:51,660
we don't see any evidence of that in
the fossil record and it seems to be

729
00:40:51,661 --> 00:40:55,470
swamped by it this thousands and
thousands of years of extreme warming,

730
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,560
but there might have been sort of
cold snaps and things like that.

731
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:02,790
What you're talking about with the Geo
engineering by shooting sulfur sulfate,

732
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,880
aerosols and to this guy.
Um,

733
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:10,950
so there's some scary studies on that
that if for any reason we'd have to,

734
00:41:10,951 --> 00:41:14,310
if we started doing that, we'd have to
keep doing it basically forever. Um,

735
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:17,360
because if you stop after
a couple of years, the,

736
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:22,650
the sulfur rains out and
people who have modeled this,

737
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,380
then in the meantime,

738
00:41:25,381 --> 00:41:29,010
if you keep building up carbon emissions
while you're managing it by reducing

739
00:41:29,011 --> 00:41:32,940
the amount of sunlight, if that's stuff
rains out, suddenly warming spikes like,

740
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:34,210
and just a few years,

741
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:36,320
you can jump up for like four
degrees or something like that.

742
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:38,090
And that would be totally catastrophic.

743
00:41:38,091 --> 00:41:42,080
So when we're planning on how
we're going to address warming,

744
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:47,060
I'm not a huge fan of, uh, that kind
of geoengineering because it relies on,

745
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,433
um,

746
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:53,620
sort of global international agreements
that are perfectly enforced forever.

747
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:56,930
And based on, you know, I don't know,

748
00:41:56,931 --> 00:42:00,950
recent global geopolitics that
prospect kind of frightens me,

749
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:04,490
but that could have been a
killing mechanism in the,
in these extinctions too,

750
00:42:04,491 --> 00:42:07,640
is that you have the sulfate aerosols
that are blocking sunlight at the same

751
00:42:07,641 --> 00:42:10,250
time. You're building carbon.
And then when it gets rained out,

752
00:42:10,251 --> 00:42:11,660
suddenly have these huge warming spikes.

753
00:42:11,661 --> 00:42:16,661
So maybe we shouldn't try and
recreate these like mass extinction,

754
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:17,983
I guess.
Yeah.

755
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:23,740
Hi. Um, so you talked about
how these media or events, um,

756
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:29,100
occasionally do, but also do not
correlate with mass extinctions,

757
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,340
but there's a, there's a greater
correlation with these, uh, you know,

758
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:35,370
apocalyptic lava flows.
Uh,

759
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:40,050
are there examples of times where there've
been huge lava events that haven't

760
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:44,040
affected life on earth or at least not
to the same extent. And in general, what,

761
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:48,930
um, what causes these, you know, huge
lava events and, and how do they work?

762
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:54,200
Uh, that's a great question. And um, yeah,
I didn't want to overcomplicate things,

763
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:58,490
but there is one,
there's one,

764
00:42:58,491 --> 00:43:02,380
I think it's a 130 million years
ago or so called the prawn,

765
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:07,510
the eights and Decca traps in South
America that are maybe as big as the ones

766
00:43:08,271 --> 00:43:11,290
associated with the mass extinctions.
And it similar lately,

767
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:13,040
it doesn't seem like
anything goes extinct.

768
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:17,060
People have argued that
maybe that's because it was
over a longer time period or

769
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:20,690
maybe it was based on the rocks that
they were going coming through. Um,

770
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:26,450
so that the Siberian traps we also know
would have burned through the one of the

771
00:43:26,451 --> 00:43:29,870
world's largest coal basins
and what burned through all
these carbon rich rocks.

772
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:32,030
And that would have been another way
of getting a ton of co two in the air.

773
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,253
And maybe if you're,

774
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:38,390
if you're coming up through rocket isn't
quite as filled with as many volatiles,

775
00:43:38,391 --> 00:43:41,810
then a, you can't quite get
to a mass extinction. Um,

776
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:47,530
but that's definitely a definitely an
active area of inquiry as to what causes

777
00:43:47,631 --> 00:43:48,464
them

778
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:54,410
that starts to get into some really
deep like geophysical questions.

779
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:58,190
Uh, but there's sort of these theories,
these things called mantle plumes,

780
00:43:58,191 --> 00:44:01,760
which are just, you know,
the mantles convicting.

781
00:44:01,761 --> 00:44:03,720
And then every once in a while
you get this like big blue,

782
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,690
like plastic blog that just emerges,
um,

783
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:10,700
just rocketing to the surface.
Um,

784
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:16,010
I know in the Triassic they think that
one of the sort of factors that might've

785
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:20,870
made it easier for one of these things
to happen is that as the continents are

786
00:44:20,871 --> 00:44:23,330
pulling apart,
that the crust would have been weaker.

787
00:44:23,331 --> 00:44:25,760
And it might've been a weak spot for one
of these things to break through to the

788
00:44:25,761 --> 00:44:29,660
surface and be as catastrophic as
it is. But yeah, why they happen,

789
00:44:29,661 --> 00:44:33,900
I don't really get into the book and I
kind of just paper over that. But yeah,

790
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:35,490
mantle plumes,
I guess.

791
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:36,893
Yeah.

792
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,310
Although those stellar theoretical,
that's just,

793
00:44:39,730 --> 00:44:41,800
people have modeled things like that,
but no one has ever,

794
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:46,890
I don't think really founded direct
evidence of mental loans right now though.

795
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:51,090
I might get in trouble for saying this
stuff because everything in the book,

796
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,820
I'm interviewing geologists and things,
I'm a science journalist,

797
00:44:53,821 --> 00:44:57,600
so for me to have an opinion about this
stuff is I'm a little out of my depth

798
00:44:57,601 --> 00:45:00,600
and doing so, but, um, I'm reporting what,

799
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,800
what I take from these geological
meetings and these interviews and reading

800
00:45:04,801 --> 00:45:05,634
these books.
So,

801
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:06,830
okay.

802
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:07,190
Thank you.
