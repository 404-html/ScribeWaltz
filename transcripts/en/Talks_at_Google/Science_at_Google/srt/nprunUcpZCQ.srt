1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,220
I'd like to introduce our
guests this morning, who is, um,

2
00:00:10,221 --> 00:00:14,960
coming to talk to us about mission
to Mars. Um, Laura Parkinson Lark.

3
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:17,480
I'm a former Googler.
Welcome back.

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,800
[inaudible]

5
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,480
all
right,

6
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,100
well, hello. Uh,

7
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:38,990
many of you may remember me as the Bora
Parkinson though I am now Laurel Arc.

8
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,630
So I was actually a Googler
for about five years. Um,

9
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,640
I worked on them up at team and in Corner
Stan until I left last January to go

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,340
to go to Mars, but not really
Mars. We'll get there, uh,

11
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:57,370
to join high seas mission five as the
mission specialist in it and media.

12
00:00:57,531 --> 00:01:01,280
Slash outreach. Um, my crew
mates had shorter titles.

13
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,250
So let's talk about Mars.
Mars is really far away,

14
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,360
so if at their farthest,
if Mars were at the back of the room,

15
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,810
the moon is somewhere around
the middle of my nostril.

16
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,490
Sorry if my face is the earth

17
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,650
important premise and Martha
at the back of the room,

18
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,550
the moon would be somewhere around the
middle of my nostril and the ISS is

19
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,930
probably so close to my skin. You
couldn't fit a hair between it and me. Um,

20
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,000
so it's much, much farther than
we've sent humans before. Uh,

21
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:39,750
so this carries a couple,
um, a couple of implications.

22
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:45,020
So teams on Mars would have to be much
more autonomous then teams on the ISS or

23
00:01:45,511 --> 00:01:46,410
even on the moon.
You know,

24
00:01:46,411 --> 00:01:50,490
you can't have teams of people sitting
in mission control watching their every

25
00:01:50,491 --> 00:01:54,540
move and telling them what to do. They're
going to be operating on their own.

26
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:58,950
They're going to be much less
in control of mission control.

27
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,293
Um,

28
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:05,910
so it also means that if you send a
team there and they don't get along or

29
00:02:05,911 --> 00:02:07,590
they're not effective for some reason,

30
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:11,220
that's really expensive because it's
so expensive to send them there in the

31
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:14,840
first place. Um, so, uh,

32
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:19,440
NASA has identified some gaps including,

33
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:22,830
uh, gaps in what we know about
how to send people to Mars,

34
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:27,720
including some to do with team
cohesion and to help fill these gaps.

35
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,730
Uh,
NASA funds high seas.

36
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,390
So high seas is basically
a psychological study.

37
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,830
They're looking at team cohesion and
team selection for a long duration space

38
00:02:37,831 --> 00:02:39,900
missions. Um, so to do this,

39
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,880
they run simulated long
duration Mars missions. Uh,

40
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,510
they've got a habitat,

41
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:50,540
they select crews and put them in the
habitat and collect a bunch of data and

42
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:54,570
see what happens.
So there have been five crew so far.

43
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:59,650
Our cruise two through four were
they focused on crew cohesion,

44
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:04,280
um, for crews five and six.
Um, so I was proof five, uh,

45
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,780
crew six goes into the Hab,
I think in February. Um,

46
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:12,280
they're focusing on crew cohesion
still and also crew selection. Uh,

47
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:16,330
and so their goal is to figure out how
to choose and support teams so that

48
00:03:16,331 --> 00:03:21,331
they'll be cohesive and highly
performing in Mars like conditions.

49
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:25,030
Um, so when we talk about
Margiela conditions, uh,

50
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:29,510
usually what people talk about
is isolated, confined an extreme.

51
00:03:29,511 --> 00:03:31,860
So that's the acronym you see ice.
Uh,

52
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,140
so the conditions at high seas
are isolated and confined.

53
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,920
They're not extreme
because, um, last I checked,

54
00:03:38,921 --> 00:03:43,090
it's not legal to put human research
subjects in mortal danger. Um,

55
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:48,070
but the information gained from high C's
can be combined with information from

56
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:52,110
the ISS or cruise in the Antarctic bases,
um,

57
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:56,680
or even a missions in Nimmo.
The underground,

58
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:01,710
the underwater laboratory to get a
holistic picture of how to send teams to

59
00:04:02,471 --> 00:04:07,040
Mars.
So let's talk about the hat.

60
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,920
Um, so this is a picture
of the High Seas Habitat.

61
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,440
Um, so it's on model Loa, volcano
in Hawaii. As you can see,

62
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:21,190
it's quite a visually
and physically isolated.

63
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:25,180
It's pretty far off the main road
that is not traveled very much.

64
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:30,190
I'm way up in the middle of these lava
fields, so not a lot of green visible.

65
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,490
Um,
it's a 8,200 feet elevation,

66
00:04:33,491 --> 00:04:36,450
about 10 miles from the
Caldera of Maunaloa. Um,

67
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,700
did not prove to be a problem for us.
Um,

68
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:44,830
and it's also chosen for its
geological similarity to Mars.

69
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:47,770
So actually the Johnson's space center,

70
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,800
Mars regolith Simulant Aka fake Mars
dirt is mind about 20 miles from here.

71
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:00,580
So, uh, the, the habits self,

72
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,580
it has about 1200 square feet of space,

73
00:05:03,581 --> 00:05:06,250
a thousand feet usable.

74
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:11,940
And it consists of this dome here
and unattached storage container.

75
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:17,180
Uh, they're connected by a little
tunnel sort of thing. And, um,

76
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,060
it's all our living space.

77
00:05:19,061 --> 00:05:23,320
We've also got our solar panels that we
get our energy from. Our water tanks are,

78
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,610
you can see our waste water tanks,
slush, evaporation field. Uh,

79
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:31,900
so this is the setup of the hab
inside.

80
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,240
We've got basically one
big area for living,

81
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:41,920
working, eating meetings. Uh,
everything we need to do exercise,

82
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,750
uh,
half the desk each.

83
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:48,770
And then upstairs we've
each got a private room. Um,

84
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,750
studies show that privacy is
important psychologically. Um,

85
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,520
so this is my room so you can see about
enough space for a desk and a bed.

86
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,510
Um, basically everybody gets a
wedge of the Pie in the upstairs.

87
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:07,970
Yeah.

88
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:09,590
And of course because we are

89
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:11,370
okay

90
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,610
on Mars, you have to suit up to
leave and I'll get to that later.

91
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,553
Okay.

92
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:22,580
Um, so the crew, we're the
lucky ones who got to go,

93
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:26,690
but there's a whole system of
people supporting the mission.

94
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:31,910
Um, and in a way, this is part of what's
being studied because the current,

95
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:37,450
the current paradigm of Mission Control
and a crew that is in close contact all

96
00:06:37,911 --> 00:06:40,820
the time and I'm very much
controlled by mission control,

97
00:06:40,821 --> 00:06:45,530
isn't going to work when you're
as far away as crews will be. So,

98
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,480
uh, we have a team of people there
to assist us called mission support.

99
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:55,810
Um, it's about 30 volunteers from
around the world. They take shifts. Uh,

100
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:59,750
we've got a first tier support
that's there to answer questions,

101
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:04,340
get us information, help us solve
problems, um, for 12 hours a day,

102
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:08,270
and then someone on 24 hours a day
in case we have a real emergency.

103
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,910
Um, so we also have our, uh,
technical and engineering support.

104
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,430
These are the people who
set up the network, uh,

105
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:20,920
who actually built the Hab and
can help us. Um, for example, uh,

106
00:07:20,921 --> 00:07:25,400
at one point our water tanks weren't
leveling and it turned out to be an

107
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:29,390
undocumented one way valve.
So they help us with this sort of issue.

108
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,720
We also have a geologist on staff who
helps us both with our assigned field work

109
00:07:36,141 --> 00:07:38,080
as part of the simulation.
Um,

110
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,970
and just with questions that we
have about the area around the hub,

111
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,590
of course there's um,
mission management to uh,

112
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:49,790
actually makes sure things run,
gets us water deliveries,

113
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:52,400
the sort of thing and
the primary researchers.

114
00:07:52,401 --> 00:07:56,720
So there are many studies
going on during each mission.

115
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:01,970
I'm on us and there's a team of
researchers conducting these,

116
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:06,200
uh, and then, uh, sort of
external partners. So both, uh,

117
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:09,350
media like you can see here a couple of
people from the New York Times as well

118
00:08:09,351 --> 00:08:14,060
as, um, our project manager and
local mission support person,

119
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:19,340
uh, and various external researchers
who some of the crew worked with.

120
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,620
Um,
and I will say with this sort of thing,

121
00:08:21,621 --> 00:08:26,270
it's very important to have
some local mission support. Um,

122
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,840
since practically we,
we are a bunch of people living on earth,

123
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:34,841
not on Mars and need people to do things
like drive up food every so often and

124
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:40,750
take away garbage and be there in case
one of us needs to be driven to the

125
00:08:42,771 --> 00:08:44,840
doctor.
In a nonemergency way or something.

126
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,150
So let's see here.

127
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:53,830
You can see a couple of our engineers are
engineers and the crew inside the hub.

128
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:03,290
So a major aspect of the mission and of
the isolation was our communications set

129
00:09:06,071 --> 00:09:10,830
up. Um, so at it's farthest, Mars
is about 24 light minutes away.

130
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:14,850
So this means real time communication
would be impossible. Uh,

131
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,430
so to simulate this,

132
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:20,970
we communicated with mission
support with our friends and family,

133
00:09:20,971 --> 00:09:25,710
with everybody outside the crew through
email that had a delay of 20 minutes put

134
00:09:25,711 --> 00:09:29,710
in each way. Um, and through
an online tool that also, uh,

135
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:34,350
both introduced a delay and tracked
our communications for research. Um,

136
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:39,950
we also had no access to
regular interactive sites
that you might like to use,

137
00:09:40,261 --> 00:09:41,780
like Google,
um,

138
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,110
which can make problem
solving pretty difficult.

139
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,980
So when we needed information,
um,

140
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,030
so with the exception of a few sites like
Wikipedia that we did have access to,

141
00:09:54,031 --> 00:09:58,570
because if you were going to Mars, you
had to download and bring Wikipedia. Um,

142
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:02,880
so with the exception of that, if we
needed information, say, you know,

143
00:10:02,881 --> 00:10:03,960
I'm running into some issue,

144
00:10:03,961 --> 00:10:07,050
can you search around and see if you can
find someone who has the same problem,

145
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,250
tell me what they said.

146
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:13,310
I need to describe my problem to mission
support in such a way that they will be

147
00:10:13,651 --> 00:10:16,770
able to search around on my behalf
and get me information back.

148
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:22,290
So this was really a, an excellent
exercise in clear communication

149
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,810
and it definitely went both ways. So we
had to be clear with mission support.

150
00:10:27,811 --> 00:10:31,050
They also needed to be clear with us.
Uh,

151
00:10:31,051 --> 00:10:34,220
so I remember once early in the mission,
um,

152
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,560
we were quite water constraint.

153
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:42,630
The company that had delivered water to
the previous crew had on short notice

154
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:46,530
announced that they weren't willing to
drive up the road to the habit anymore.

155
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,930
And so we had about,
uh,

156
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:54,380
our tanks were about half full and we
had no water delivery scheduled or way to

157
00:10:54,691 --> 00:10:58,830
get water. Uh, so we were
conserving pretty heavily.

158
00:10:58,831 --> 00:11:03,060
We were down to about two gallons per
person per day and had been there for

159
00:11:03,061 --> 00:11:03,631
maybe a week.

160
00:11:03,631 --> 00:11:08,130
It was starting to get smelly and we
get an email from mission support saying

161
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,160
the water truck is coming and I have
never seen this crew work together so well

162
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,220
or so quickly.

163
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:22,430
Everybody Sprang into action and got
their showers and got laundry going,

164
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:27,720
drained the water from the tank so
that we could water the plants. Uh,

165
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:31,270
and in about a half an
hour, we drained, um, uh,

166
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:36,080
nearly all of our remaining
usable water from the tanks. Uh,

167
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:39,600
so 40 minutes later, you know,
20 minutes here, 20 minutes back,

168
00:11:39,601 --> 00:11:44,580
we get a second email that says the water
trucks are coming to see if they can

169
00:11:44,581 --> 00:11:45,414
get up the road.

170
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:53,100
It was really, it was an
emotional roller coaster that day.

171
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,020
Um, so fortunately for us, they
were able to get up the road.

172
00:11:59,021 --> 00:12:01,600
They weren't there to deliver that day,
but they came a few days later,

173
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:05,170
we had an emergency tank that lucky for
us was cleaned for the first time just

174
00:12:05,171 --> 00:12:07,060
before mission started.
Um,

175
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:11,070
so we were able to transfer
some water and, you know,

176
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,500
not run dry.
Um,

177
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:18,430
but it illustrates the importance
of clear communication in both ways.

178
00:12:18,431 --> 00:12:21,220
When your only method is email.

179
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,480
So I,
we,

180
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:31,540
the communication delay also
meant that, uh, to a large degree,

181
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:34,660
our social support had to
come from inside the hat.

182
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:38,800
So we were allowed as much communication
as we wanted with family and friends,

183
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:39,940
um,

184
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:44,860
encouraged shoe email with
them or a transfer video files,

185
00:12:44,861 --> 00:12:49,660
even though I think people didn't end
up taking much advantage of that because

186
00:12:49,661 --> 00:12:51,760
there's really not a lot of
audio privacy in the Hab.

187
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:56,530
So even something as simple
as, hi, I had a fine day,

188
00:12:56,531 --> 00:12:57,370
how were you?

189
00:12:57,371 --> 00:13:00,460
It feels really awkward when all of your
crew is sitting there and can hear you.

190
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,950
Um, but so it means that the
crew really becomes each others,

191
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,960
family, friends, colleagues.

192
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:13,260
It is a self contained social network and
all of your support tends to come from

193
00:13:13,421 --> 00:13:17,560
that which makes maintaining
relationships with each other. Really,

194
00:13:17,561 --> 00:13:21,500
really important. Um, so I,

195
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,740
as I tell you about the mission,

196
00:13:23,741 --> 00:13:28,741
I'm also going to tell you
a few conclusions that I
drew that I think may be

197
00:13:29,201 --> 00:13:33,490
relevant to life here at Google. And
this brings me to the first one. Um,

198
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:38,020
so, uh, what I,

199
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:42,300
one thing that I found underlaid
a lot of our success, um,

200
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:47,470
both as a team is maintaining
our relationships as a
group and individually with

201
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:52,390
each other and in our successes at art
assign tasks or geological field work or

202
00:13:52,391 --> 00:13:54,410
getting data for the researchers,
um,

203
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,490
was our mutual commitment to doing so.

204
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:02,380
So early in the mission we sat down as
a crew and we wrote a mission statement

205
00:14:02,381 --> 00:14:03,670
for ourselves.
Um,

206
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:07,630
so of course there are things that we were
supposed to do because it was our job,

207
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,590
but we decided to decide for ourselves
as well what was important to us.

208
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:16,810
And we decided that as a crew we were
committed to being a cohesive team,

209
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:21,240
high quality outreach, and getting
good data for the researchers. Um,

210
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:26,250
so high quality data and this provided
a very important foundation for the rest

211
00:14:28,631 --> 00:14:32,320
of the mission. It meant that
if, you know, if I'm having
an issue with somebody,

212
00:14:32,321 --> 00:14:34,130
I need to take them aside.
Um,

213
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,600
whether it's just that we need to talk
and resolve miscommunication or I need

214
00:14:39,941 --> 00:14:41,830
them to change their behavior in some way,

215
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,910
I know that they're going to be right
there with me solving the problem with me,

216
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,700
working with me,
um,

217
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:52,980
because we already committed to each
other to do in a really wholehearted,

218
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,410
genuine way.
So I,

219
00:14:57,411 --> 00:14:58,700
and I,

220
00:14:58,701 --> 00:15:03,701
so I encourage teams that need
to accomplish something like,

221
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:08,720
I mean, not exactly like this, but need
to accomplish something series together,

222
00:15:08,721 --> 00:15:11,350
like probably all of you,
uh,

223
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:16,720
to come up with principles that you can
all be really genuinely committed to two

224
00:15:18,741 --> 00:15:22,310
together. Um, and I don't mean
goals like, okay, ours, you know,

225
00:15:22,311 --> 00:15:26,330
what are we getting done in the
next month or something. But, uh,

226
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:30,380
core values like being a cohesive team.

227
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,290
Okay. Back to the, back to the fun stuff.

228
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:39,950
So I'll tell you a little
bit about have life now. Um,

229
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,320
so as you would need on Mars,

230
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:46,490
all of our food had to be shelf stable
for three years and somewhat realistic.

231
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:51,920
Uh, so that meant mostly freeze
dried food cans would be too heavy.

232
00:15:51,921 --> 00:15:54,140
It'd be too expensive to
send their unrealistic.

233
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,910
So lots of bags and cans of
odd looking stuff like this.

234
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:03,110
I think we have here, uh,
milk freeze dried salmon,

235
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:07,310
chicken cubes, beef crumbles,
soup and Mozzarella.

236
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:14,890
So surprisingly it was actually not too
hard to make delicious food out of this.

237
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:21,390
They smelled really weird, but
when rehydrated are delicious, um,

238
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:26,990
so I think one of the had favorites
was deep dish pizza for example.

239
00:16:26,991 --> 00:16:29,630
It's turns out it's pretty easy
to make a decent tomato sauce.

240
00:16:29,631 --> 00:16:30,920
You throw in the powder tomato,

241
00:16:30,921 --> 00:16:34,850
the dried onions and just keep doing that
and some spices until you stop up the

242
00:16:34,851 --> 00:16:38,210
water. Um, the cheese, it if you,

243
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:42,680
if you bake it after rehydrating it sort
of loses its crunchy inner inner core

244
00:16:42,681 --> 00:16:45,350
and um,
it gets a lot more palatable.

245
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:52,590
The exception to this is
food that we grow. Uh,

246
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:56,330
so we had a few systems for
doing so in the Hab actually,

247
00:16:56,331 --> 00:16:58,520
mostly not by the window. Um, both,

248
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,430
both because that's ineffective
and unrealistic. Uh,

249
00:17:01,431 --> 00:17:03,350
we had a couple of hydroponic systems,

250
00:17:03,351 --> 00:17:05,300
a crew mate of mine
used to work on Veggie,

251
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:09,090
which is the system they use on
the ISS for growing vegetables. Um,

252
00:17:09,091 --> 00:17:13,730
so he got them to send us prototype and
he was working with that as well as its

253
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,000
earthbound outreach focused
counterpart growing beyond earth.

254
00:17:17,001 --> 00:17:21,020
So we had those in the Hab and got quite
a bit of produce from them as well as

255
00:17:21,021 --> 00:17:25,940
just some grow lights in the back that
we could grow stuff with. So we had,

256
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:31,360
not a lot but enough for a bite every
so often of various greens and peas,

257
00:17:32,571 --> 00:17:37,460
beans, even a few tomatoes that
were a, an occasional treat.

258
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,690
I remember once, um, Earl,

259
00:17:41,691 --> 00:17:44,160
my crewmate who works on
Veggie and I were, uh,

260
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,280
we'd harvest it about a month's worth of,

261
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:51,760
of leafy stuff and we were making a
salad and Jay smelled it from his room.

262
00:17:52,861 --> 00:17:56,370
So upstairs door closed, he comes
out, are you cutting lettuce?

263
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:03,770
So it really was a treat, but, uh, so, um,

264
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:07,590
we did not bring all of our food
with us to begin with. Uh, we had,

265
00:18:07,591 --> 00:18:11,890
we probably could have lived off of
what was in the Hab to begin with. Uh,

266
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:16,920
but we got three or four, what we call
resupplies throughout the mission,

267
00:18:16,921 --> 00:18:19,840
Aka Hab Christmas.
Um,

268
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,250
so you can see here a
pretty typical resupply. Uh,

269
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,820
we've got tomato flakes,
beef crumbles,

270
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:31,440
I think some strawberries and in the back,
the all important toilet paper.

271
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,390
Um, so at every resupply, uh,

272
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:40,391
so for the resupplies we'd submit our
requests for what we wanted a month,

273
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:46,050
about maybe two months in advance,
and then the resupply would be for two,

274
00:18:46,051 --> 00:18:49,230
three months.
So we were planning many months ahead,

275
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:55,010
but did get to have some input
as far as our taste in food. Um,

276
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,760
if you were actually going to Mars,

277
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:59,460
the crew would probably know each other
for years ahead of time and would be

278
00:18:59,461 --> 00:19:02,560
able to help plan the food that gets sent.
Um,

279
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,380
but it turned out that for each resupply,

280
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:09,510
there tended to be
something that we didn't,

281
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:15,270
didn't budget per
perfectly, um, one resupply.

282
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:19,380
It was paper towels that we were
really looking forward to. Another,

283
00:19:19,381 --> 00:19:24,240
I think it was onions and once I, it
was bananas. So two crew mates of mine,

284
00:19:24,241 --> 00:19:27,450
we're really looking forward
to the freeze dried bananas.

285
00:19:27,451 --> 00:19:30,140
We'd been out for a month or something.
Um,

286
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,750
and they loved the freeze dried bananas.
So I,

287
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:38,000
my crew mate and I who were out picking
up the resupply that day, uh, you know,

288
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:42,750
we get to where it is and there's
a big box and it says bananas.

289
00:19:42,751 --> 00:19:46,800
And so it's 20 pounds of freeze dried
bananas, which for reference the boxes,

290
00:19:46,801 --> 00:19:51,090
maybe this big, like I could fit
in that box. It's a lot of bananas.

291
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:54,810
So we tell them over the
radio, we got bananas. Uh,

292
00:19:54,811 --> 00:19:58,470
and as we're bringing
them back up, um, it was,

293
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,820
it was dark at the time.

294
00:19:59,821 --> 00:20:04,080
And I see that we have this led strip
in the Hab and they turned it on to be a

295
00:20:04,081 --> 00:20:08,470
rainbow strobe light.
And the Hab was pumping out Gwen Stefani,

296
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,520
the a an a,

297
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,530
there was a lot of excitement
in the hat that day.

298
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:18,660
So,
uh,

299
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,890
another way in which the mission
was somewhat realistic, uh,

300
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,030
was in our limited resources.
Um,

301
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:31,380
so these are our solar panels
with very little exception.

302
00:20:31,381 --> 00:20:33,120
All of our energy came from these,

303
00:20:33,121 --> 00:20:38,060
so cloudy days we'd need to
conserve sunny days less. So, um,

304
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,280
if we did,
if we had multiple cloudy days in a row,

305
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:44,560
we had a backup generator
generator, we could run, um,

306
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,610
keep critical hab systems up and running.
Uh,

307
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:51,280
and if for some reason we weren't
able to go out, for example,

308
00:20:51,281 --> 00:20:54,100
we had some pretty heavy sustained winds.

309
00:20:54,101 --> 00:20:58,510
At one point we had hydrogen fuel cells
that would kick in as a backup. Um,

310
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,760
so we weren't actually in,

311
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:05,790
we had lots of redundancy and weren't
in danger of our systems going down or

312
00:21:07,211 --> 00:21:10,890
anything. Um, but mainly our
power was from solar, uh,

313
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,820
which ended up being less
constraining than the water.

314
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,570
Um, so, uh,

315
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,430
since high seas is a psychological study,
they are simulating things,

316
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,440
um, well enough to be
relevant psychologically.

317
00:21:29,441 --> 00:21:31,150
So for example,
our water was limited,

318
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,220
but we weren't actually exercising
recyclers. It came from tanks. Um, so,

319
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:41,020
uh,
it was sort of up to us to limit our use.

320
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:44,950
Um, I think possibly,
again, for legal reasons,

321
00:21:44,951 --> 00:21:49,930
they're not allowed to tell us
not to use water. Um, but I,

322
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:54,760
so we ended up using about five to six
gallons per person per day for reference.

323
00:21:54,761 --> 00:21:58,460
This is about 5% of what the
average American uses. Uh,

324
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:03,460
so we did this with, uh,
a few methods including,

325
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,730
um, you know, bucket bathing
rather than showering.

326
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,580
So we were allowed eight
minutes of shower per week,

327
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:13,870
but often chose to use that
in a couple bunches with, um,

328
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:18,760
a little bit of bathing
between, um, this is,

329
00:22:18,761 --> 00:22:23,160
you can see here our dishes set up.
So we've got our grind bucket,

330
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:27,490
our soap bucket are rinse
bucket, uh, that we can,

331
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,170
that allows us to do a whole dinners
worth of dishes with only a couple extra

332
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:35,950
gallons cause we can sort
of move everything left as
we go and reuse the water

333
00:22:35,951 --> 00:22:37,550
as it gets. Or, um,

334
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:43,290
so it was up to us to come up with
this sort of system to conserve a,

335
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:48,320
and one important way or thing that we
had that allowed us to do so was that we

336
00:22:48,491 --> 00:22:51,170
had composting toilets.
Um,

337
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,760
so we had a couple of these in the
habit was up to us to keep them happy,

338
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:01,660
which was important to both their
and our quality of life. Um,

339
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,780
so we turned to them
a couple times a week,

340
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,860
put in microbes and then
empty them once a week.

341
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:11,770
One of the more glamorous
aspects of living on Mars,

342
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,430
it was actually a somewhat coveted
chore because although it's not super

343
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:22,960
pleasant, it can sort of end up
being a bonding experience. You know,

344
00:23:22,961 --> 00:23:26,740
you either end up with someone
who's really okay with it
and then that's kind of

345
00:23:26,741 --> 00:23:27,100
fun,

346
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:31,960
or who's I entertained by
not being okay with it.

347
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:35,680
And then that's just fun for both of you,
for one of you.

348
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,270
Um,
so I,

349
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:43,960
it was a somewhat coveted chore because
it took less time than the other chores.

350
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,850
Um,
and was ended up being kind of fun,

351
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,150
at least for me because I
didn't really mind it. Um,

352
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:54,690
so I, in addition to, uh,

353
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:58,040
the resource conservation and
the shelf stable food, uh,

354
00:23:58,041 --> 00:23:59,420
we had to exercise quite a bit.

355
00:23:59,421 --> 00:24:03,800
So this was both for our
own health because we're in
this very small space for a

356
00:24:03,801 --> 00:24:08,690
long time. We need to keep our
hearts healthy and such. Uh,

357
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,610
but also because on Mars you would
have to exercise quite a bit, we think,

358
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,560
uh, to maintain your bone density and
muscle mass and also your health since you

359
00:24:18,561 --> 00:24:20,120
would be in a confined space.

360
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:24,620
So we had about an hour and a half
allocated each data exercise. Um,

361
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:29,000
I think on the ISS it's even more, it
might be two or three hours per day. Uh,

362
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:34,030
but so the simulated the time drain and
the energy drain of having to exercise

363
00:24:34,371 --> 00:24:37,700
that much. Um, so lastly, uh,

364
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:42,790
both for our own psychological wellbeing
and health as a group community,

365
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:50,250
we had quite a lot of fun together.
So we'd watch movies, play Games, um,

366
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,650
have special dinners.

367
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:56,180
We had a couple of Hibachi nights where
two crew members would get out the

368
00:24:56,181 --> 00:24:58,120
griddle and um,

369
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:03,430
marinade some of the beef cubes and then
chop it all up on the griddle and throw

370
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:08,210
things at each other.
This is a picture of a,

371
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:12,260
one of our open mic nights. So
we had a couple of these, uh,

372
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:16,520
we would sort of rearrange the hat
and turned it into a coffee shop,

373
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:19,610
take out some of the tables that we
used for some of the research tasks and

374
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:24,490
perform things for each
other. So it was, uh,

375
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:29,300
it was really up to us to make the,
have a lively social environment.

376
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,270
And that was one of the parts
I enjoyed most about it.

377
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:40,800
Yes. Yes they are. We
made some donuts. Um,

378
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,300
we had flour and yeast,

379
00:25:43,301 --> 00:25:46,580
which you could argue is more
like two years shelf stable. Um,

380
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,400
but would probably be good enough,

381
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:53,010
especially if you kept it
in the right conditions. Um,

382
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:56,430
I also had a sourdough starter for,
uh,

383
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:00,870
for most of the mission and
then it got too cold for it. Um,

384
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:03,940
and also I stopped feeding it in one
of these things. Probably killed it.

385
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:10,880
So I get asked a lot, what do we
do all day? So we're kicked him in.

386
00:26:10,881 --> 00:26:14,050
The stone were pretending to be on Mars.
What's our actual job?

387
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,020
So first and foremost,
we are lab rats.

388
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,050
We are the subjects of
the primary research. Um,

389
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:24,010
so as part of this we give
spit and hair samples.

390
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,660
These will be measured after the mission,
um,

391
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:30,550
for stress hormones to study both how
this varies monthly throughout the mission

392
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:32,590
and how it varies throughout the day.

393
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:36,340
So I'm on certain days will give several
spit samples throughout the day and

394
00:26:36,341 --> 00:26:37,990
those will be give you the daily rhythm.

395
00:26:37,991 --> 00:26:42,750
And then every month we shave
a little bit of our heads.

396
00:26:42,751 --> 00:26:46,040
So I have bald spot for science now.
Um,

397
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:51,360
we also wear sociometric badges. So these
measure our proximity to each other.

398
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,180
I only four hours a day,
not all the time. Um,

399
00:26:54,181 --> 00:26:58,170
so these measure our proximity to each
other and the volumes of our voices and

400
00:26:58,171 --> 00:27:01,320
are also connected to, uh,
to heart rate monitors.

401
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:03,510
So we hear that from this.

402
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:07,440
They can tell whether we're having an
argument or whether we're avoiding each

403
00:27:07,441 --> 00:27:08,011
other.
Though,

404
00:27:08,011 --> 00:27:11,700
I think they may be more accurately
detecting whether we were playing video

405
00:27:11,701 --> 00:27:12,534
games.

406
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:19,470
So we also were 24, seven,
a act to watches which are,

407
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:24,040
which have accelerometers and light
sensors as part of a sleep study. Um,

408
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:28,620
so in addition to the
actual physical metrics,

409
00:27:28,621 --> 00:27:32,030
we do quite a few team activities.
Um,

410
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:34,440
so here's one for example.
Uh,

411
00:27:34,441 --> 00:27:38,250
there's sometimes games or things that
we need to do to calibrate the equipment.

412
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,353
Um,

413
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:43,680
and through these and through
surveys associated with them,

414
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:46,470
the researchers are measuring our
communication with each other,

415
00:27:46,471 --> 00:27:51,000
our interactions with each other, how
well we're cooperating, the sort of thing.

416
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:52,823
Um,

417
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:57,090
I also get asked if we
recorded and we were,

418
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,690
we were asked to record
some portions of our life.

419
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:02,280
So for example,

420
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:06,570
all of our meetings were recorded and
they'll be analyzed for, you know,

421
00:28:06,571 --> 00:28:09,990
who's speaking up, who's being heard, um,

422
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,080
how are we interacting?
Uh,

423
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:18,410
and also all of our I eva data
is both audio and video recorded.

424
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:22,770
And then we bundle that up and
send it to the researchers.

425
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,330
And the lastly, they get a lot
of information through surveys.

426
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:30,630
So we did a lot of surveys,
more than a thousand each.

427
00:28:30,631 --> 00:28:33,240
First thing when we wake up,
the last thing before we go to bed,

428
00:28:33,241 --> 00:28:34,410
we fill out surveys.

429
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:39,680
These are everything from a
self perceived stress to uh,

430
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,000
surveys, asking about how we're
doing, treating us as a family,

431
00:28:45,001 --> 00:28:48,240
to uh,
describe what happened to this week,

432
00:28:48,241 --> 00:28:50,730
what was most difficult
in these different ways.

433
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,230
So that's where a lot of the data
for the study is coming from.

434
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,350
So we also had quite a bit of time
allocated for personal projects. Uh,

435
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,720
so mine,

436
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:08,810
I brought a drone and I basically
focused on what it could be used for.

437
00:29:09,151 --> 00:29:10,610
So,
uh,

438
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:16,100
I use ditch to build models of relevant
parts of the area around the Hab.

439
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,190
Um,

440
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:22,190
used it for a scouting both
to try and find things and uh,

441
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:26,280
to look at an area without
having to go there first. Um,

442
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:31,260
this is a model that I built with it.
Um,

443
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,600
and it turns out you can
do all sorts of things.

444
00:29:33,601 --> 00:29:35,490
Once you've got an elevation model,

445
00:29:35,491 --> 00:29:38,760
you can compute elevation
profiles from that slopes,

446
00:29:38,761 --> 00:29:42,310
changes in elevation volumes.
Um,

447
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:46,840
all kinds of useful stuff. Other people
on the crew we're working, like I said,

448
00:29:46,841 --> 00:29:50,770
on Veggie, I, one person was
working on manufacturing, um,

449
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:55,950
molecules in a constrained lab
like you might have on Mars.

450
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:58,510
Um,
useful for things like medicine.

451
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:01,840
Since one problem about,

452
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:06,160
or one challenge for long duration space
flight is that a lot of medicine has a

453
00:30:06,161 --> 00:30:09,770
shelf life of less than you'd
probably be out there. Uh,

454
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:14,680
so being able to manufacture this sort
of stuff in situ is pretty important. Um,

455
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:19,930
others were looking at, uh, optimizing
our resource usage in the hab sampling,

456
00:30:19,931 --> 00:30:24,730
lava tubes for what might be growing
there, three d printing, a bunch of stuff.

457
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:31,000
Um, and lastly, we spent
quite a bit of time on Eva.

458
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:34,570
So Eva stands for extra
vehicular activity.

459
00:30:34,571 --> 00:30:38,620
This is when we suit up and go outside
the hat. Um, but it's not that simple.

460
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:42,060
So if we want to go outside of the Hab,
uh,

461
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:46,390
the day before we have a meeting,
we plan what we're going to do.

462
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:49,540
Um,
we practice it if necessary.

463
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:54,040
We write up a request and we send it
to mission support. If they approve it,

464
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:57,250
then the next day, about a half an
hour before we're scheduled to go out,

465
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,850
we gather our personnel, equipment,
batteries, water, whatever.

466
00:31:00,851 --> 00:31:05,800
We need a suit up, get ready, and
we still can't go outside. Um,

467
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,630
because if you were actually on Mars,

468
00:31:07,631 --> 00:31:11,560
the outside pressure on the
inside pressure are very
different and the outside

469
00:31:11,561 --> 00:31:15,420
pressure is not so suitable for humans
and the [inaudible] if you just opened

470
00:31:15,421 --> 00:31:19,010
the door, the people inside would
probably not. Thank you. Um,

471
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:24,060
so we simulate decompression by sealing
off a part of the Hab and waiting for a

472
00:31:25,811 --> 00:31:29,920
little while. So once we
decompress, we, um, well,

473
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:32,740
I mean for a defined a little while.
Uh,

474
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,900
so once we decompress
so we can go outside,

475
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:39,720
we follow the route that we
planned ahead of times. Um,

476
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:44,440
we are constrained by the time that
we requested. Uh, we come back in,

477
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,693
I,

478
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:50,760
we recompress and we're still not done
because we need to debrief with each

479
00:31:51,221 --> 00:31:55,660
other. We need to process a lot of
the data from the eva write summaries,

480
00:31:55,661 --> 00:31:59,950
send them to mission support.
Um, so going outside,

481
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:04,720
although it's quite atonomous
in the actual execution of it,

482
00:32:04,721 --> 00:32:09,721
is still highly controlled as it
probably would be if you were on Mars.

483
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:12,820
Given that going outside is one of the
more dangerous things you would have to

484
00:32:12,821 --> 00:32:15,610
do a and throughout the whole thing,

485
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:20,050
we stay in contact with each other of
your radio and are required at all times

486
00:32:20,051 --> 00:32:24,520
to be in contact with the person inside
the Hab who's called Hab calm or ivy for

487
00:32:24,521 --> 00:32:27,870
intro vehicular.
Uh,

488
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:31,780
so this brings me to the second
thing I'd like to talk to you about,

489
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,990
which is this process.

490
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:38,710
So we found we had a,

491
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:44,220
a great number of successful EBS and a
great number of unsuccessful PDAs and

492
00:32:44,601 --> 00:32:49,440
found that the successful ones
were usually do too good, uh,

493
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:53,930
execution of this process.
And when we had an unsuccessful one,

494
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:56,360
it was usually because we'd
failed somewhere in here.

495
00:32:56,870 --> 00:33:01,370
So I think usually when people think, oh,
I have something critical I need to do,

496
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:05,180
I'll plan it and then I'll do it.
Um, but there's more to it than that.

497
00:33:05,181 --> 00:33:07,700
So for example,
once we were,

498
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:11,660
we were trying to measure a
cross sections of a lava tube,

499
00:33:11,661 --> 00:33:15,840
we were trying to validate a
digital method that weed, um,

500
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,560
that we wanted to use for future tasks.

501
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:22,820
And so we were choosing cross sections
to measure and that turned out to be

502
00:33:22,821 --> 00:33:26,870
really contentious. When you were out
in the field, um, one person would say,

503
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:29,420
this is the cross section we need
another would say it's too close to the

504
00:33:29,421 --> 00:33:33,050
opening, there's too much ambient
light here and there's really,

505
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:35,570
it's not the place to have
a discussion like this.

506
00:33:35,571 --> 00:33:39,350
You need to have had that
kind of discussion before
you go out and when you out.

507
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:43,370
It's just time for execution. Um, and
we figured out when we got back in,

508
00:33:43,371 --> 00:33:48,371
it was because the different people out
had different ideas of what problem we

509
00:33:48,591 --> 00:33:51,050
were trying to solve with the
data that we were collecting.

510
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:56,210
So we hadn't done a good enough job
of defining the problem that we had.

511
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:01,520
Um, another time we were, uh,

512
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:05,270
we were planning an emergency
route in case we needed to,

513
00:34:05,271 --> 00:34:09,740
to do a simulated evacuation to a
lava tube. So if you were on Mars,

514
00:34:09,741 --> 00:34:13,820
occasionally there are periods of
higher radiation. Um, you know,

515
00:34:13,821 --> 00:34:16,730
the sun releases a bunch of particles
and here we're protected by our

516
00:34:16,731 --> 00:34:20,090
magnetosphere, but on Mars you'd
need to shield yourself somehow.

517
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,810
And one suggestion is that people might
hunker down in a lava tube until it

518
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:27,860
passes. So we were planning an
evacuation route to a lava tube nearby,

519
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:30,860
um,
and uh,

520
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:34,970
because we knew that this sort
of thing might come day or night,

521
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:39,620
we needed to mark it out in a way that
would be easy to follow at night as well.

522
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:43,590
So we actually, we went
out ahead of time, um,

523
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:48,880
requested a night eva and tested the
different kinds of markers we had.

524
00:34:49,131 --> 00:34:51,530
And it turns out that what
we thought would work well,

525
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:56,300
we had these super shiny pieces of tape
was impossible to see unless you had it

526
00:34:56,301 --> 00:34:59,870
at just the right angle because it would
reflect your flashlight off somewhere.

527
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:01,310
That wasn't your eyes.
Um,

528
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:05,180
but we had these little orange flags that
turned out to be super fluorescent and

529
00:35:05,181 --> 00:35:06,050
those worked really well.

530
00:35:06,051 --> 00:35:10,180
So we ended up finding this out
in marking the path with them. Um,

531
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,400
we did a simulated or we requested to
practice at night to make sure that it

532
00:35:15,951 --> 00:35:16,784
worked,

533
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:21,710
which was one of the odder experiences
because it was one of the times when we

534
00:35:21,711 --> 00:35:25,970
were all outside together. So
usually two out, two in for safety.

535
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:27,723
Um,

536
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:32,660
but we had gotten permission to practice
this evacuation and so all six of us

537
00:35:32,661 --> 00:35:37,661
were out with our supplies at night and
I was imagining what someone would think

538
00:35:38,371 --> 00:35:43,371
if they found us six people in a line in
Hazmat suits walking across the lava in

539
00:35:44,731 --> 00:35:48,060
the middle of nowhere.
I, I'd be concerned.

540
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:54,390
Um, so I think this,
this process applies to,

541
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,310
uh,
any,

542
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,240
any group that needs to
do something critical,

543
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,370
something that needs to
go right the first time.

544
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,193
Yeah.

545
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,790
So we did EBS for a variety of reasons.
Um,

546
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:13,900
a lot of it was purely operational.
Take down the trash, take down the poop.

547
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:17,680
This is the, um, the pile that we
had near the end of the mission.

548
00:36:17,681 --> 00:36:20,680
I think the last pickup was
around three months ago. Um,

549
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:25,890
so this is the sort of stuff you don't
want hanging around in the Hab. Um,

550
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:30,350
we go down to pick up resupplies I
sometimes check on our water tank,

551
00:36:30,351 --> 00:36:33,760
see how the levels are doing a
run the generator if we need to,

552
00:36:33,761 --> 00:36:35,020
which we did a couple of times.

553
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:36,643
MMM.

554
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:40,970
We were also assigned quite a
bit of geological field work.

555
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,540
This is actually the main reason that
we go outside is to collect data of

556
00:36:44,541 --> 00:36:48,490
various sorts. I on the
area around the hub. Um,

557
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:51,590
so some of it was straight
up measurements. Um,

558
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:55,040
because of the geological field
work is part of the study.

559
00:36:55,041 --> 00:36:58,700
A lot of it is focused on our teamwork.
While we do it.

560
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:02,540
The tasks are actually are part
of the control between missions.

561
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,750
So each mission gets the same ones,

562
00:37:05,751 --> 00:37:10,430
which is why I won't tell you
a ton about them. Um, but, uh,

563
00:37:10,431 --> 00:37:12,200
so like I was saying,

564
00:37:12,201 --> 00:37:15,620
a lot of it turned out to be straight up
physical measurements of things around

565
00:37:15,621 --> 00:37:20,270
the Hab. Um, some of it was
mapping the geological units.

566
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:21,500
So,
you know,

567
00:37:21,501 --> 00:37:25,910
go see where flows intersect
and try and figure out,

568
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:30,890
you know, what came first, how old is
this? Some of it was pretty qualitative.

569
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:36,800
Um, so look at things
like this, that I are,

570
00:37:36,801 --> 00:37:38,240
these really weird formations.
You know,

571
00:37:38,241 --> 00:37:41,630
there's this thing on the top of the hill.
And last I checked,

572
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,020
lava flowed like a liquid and
obeyed the laws of gravity.

573
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:49,580
So how did these weird lumps that
are about this big come to be?

574
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:54,920
So go look at them and try and deduce
what, how they formed, what happened here.

575
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:59,120
Um, and some of it was, uh,

576
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:03,680
more focused on the inside. Take
samples, come in. This is a picture of,

577
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:06,980
and all of you and crystal and a
chunk of a boy float near the Hab.

578
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:16,910
Um, we were also working with a team
out of NASA Goddard. So this is,

579
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:21,940
this instrument is a called a mini LHR
miniature laser Heterodyne radiometer or

580
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,230
something.
Um,

581
00:38:24,231 --> 00:38:27,800
it measures trace gases in the
column of air between it and the sun.

582
00:38:27,801 --> 00:38:31,240
So they were looking at co two
and methane in the atmosphere. Uh,

583
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:35,060
so this had two purposes. They were
actually using the data from this.

584
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:40,590
And it was also a study of how we would
communicate with the researchers behind

585
00:38:40,721 --> 00:38:43,780
it to collect the data to fix it.
When things went wrong.

586
00:38:43,781 --> 00:38:47,140
It did at one point get out of alignment
and we were figuring out how to level

587
00:38:47,141 --> 00:38:49,830
it and what might be wrong with it.
Um,

588
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:54,580
we've got to do quite a few
emergency drills, um, which
tended to be a lot of fun.

589
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:59,380
And we also got, uh, quite
a bit of freedom to, um,

590
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,450
to go on exploratory vas.

591
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:06,720
So go out and check out lava tubes are
skylights or I just go see things that

592
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:13,330
looked like they might be interesting
on Google earth or a that we'd seen in a

593
00:39:13,331 --> 00:39:14,164
drone flight.

594
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:19,860
And this brings me to the third
thing I'd like to talk to you about.

595
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:25,240
Um, so this is us in a lava tube.
That was one of my favorite parts.

596
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:27,310
Um,

597
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:32,080
so over and over we found that
work that we did for one reason,

598
00:39:32,081 --> 00:39:35,230
whether it was for fun, just because
we thought it might be interesting,

599
00:39:35,231 --> 00:39:37,240
we want it to go there.
Um,

600
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:42,570
or maybe we were out with
the drone filming just to,

601
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:44,680
just to film.
Uh,

602
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:49,710
we'd found we'd find that this work
would be useful in unexpected other ways.

603
00:39:49,991 --> 00:39:54,991
So maybe we'd happened to get footage
of an area that we needed to go for

604
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:00,670
mission-related purposes later and now
we can actually make a plan with some

605
00:40:00,671 --> 00:40:03,540
knowledge of what it looks like they're,
um,

606
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:09,130
instead of with whatever we can glean
from Google Earth, which is not much. Um,

607
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:12,250
or you know,
maybe we've actually been there before.

608
00:40:12,251 --> 00:40:16,390
It's a lava tube that we've
already explored. So for example,

609
00:40:16,391 --> 00:40:20,970
once we mapped a lava tube system
just for fun to try mapping, uh,

610
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:22,610
but ended up,
uh,

611
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,640
knowing the right amount about it to
use it for an emergency drill later. Um,

612
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:32,320
so to some extent, I'm preaching to the
choir here, Google with its 20% time.

613
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:34,450
Um,
but we,

614
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:39,640
I encourage all of you to continue
what exploratory work you do.

615
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:44,260
Um,
because in my experience it is very,

616
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:47,480
it is valuable in unexpected ways.
Um,

617
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:52,770
and in my opinion that applies to
space flight as a whole as well.

618
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:55,480
Um,
there have been many,

619
00:40:55,481 --> 00:41:00,481
many unexpected benefits to life on
earth from the space programs so far.

620
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:04,930
For example, I think there was a,
uh, fuel valve and the shuttle,

621
00:41:04,931 --> 00:41:08,250
maybe you've heard of this, that
turned out to be just perfect for, um,

622
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:13,900
the time between when you need a heart
and when you get a heart for little kids,

623
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:18,160
like they hadn't figured out how to make
reliable little valves like that until

624
00:41:18,161 --> 00:41:21,160
they did it for the shuttle and
now they can use them for hearts

625
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,023
anyway.

626
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:30,430
So I can't tell you too much
about the actual geology tasks,

627
00:41:30,431 --> 00:41:35,260
but I can tell you some about the
various challenges of being on Eva. Um,

628
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:39,970
so this is me trying to, I think
trying to fit in that hole, um,

629
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:44,310
which is a bit difficult in these
suits because they're quite bulky, um,

630
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,580
as suits would be.

631
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,253
MMM.

632
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:51,520
You also had some some visibility issues.

633
00:41:51,521 --> 00:41:55,330
So this was one of the ways in
which having the mini Lhr there,

634
00:41:55,331 --> 00:41:57,790
which was attempted to,

635
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:01,810
they attempted to build
it for our situation. Um,

636
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:04,270
but we turned out to have a
lot of challenges with it.

637
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:06,640
I think this person is
trying to see the screen.

638
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:09,463
MMM.

639
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:14,840
And this person is trying
to see an illuminated dot
that is sort of right at the

640
00:42:15,781 --> 00:42:19,640
base of the barrel there. Um, again,

641
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:24,240
an exercise in communication,
we uh,

642
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,580
this may be relevant to you as well,

643
00:42:26,581 --> 00:42:31,581
but we found videos to be a much easier
way of sending scientific information.

644
00:42:33,601 --> 00:42:35,580
Then written descriptions.

645
00:42:35,581 --> 00:42:39,720
So here we were told that it is
aligned if you see an illuminated dot.

646
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,810
And so we thought there must be an led.

647
00:42:42,811 --> 00:42:44,860
We can kind of squint and
see through the visor.

648
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:46,470
This thing that looks
like it might be an led.

649
00:42:46,471 --> 00:42:49,830
So I think this person is
trying to see if the led is on.

650
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:55,050
Turns out the illuminated.is
created by a shadow.

651
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,770
So at the end of the barrel,
there's this little hole.

652
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:01,110
And if it's perfectly
aligned with the son,

653
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:05,330
then the son will cast this little spot
right on what is a sensor not in led.

654
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:08,850
And so when we were looking
for a v illuminated dot,

655
00:43:08,851 --> 00:43:11,880
we were actually just making it go away
by shading the whole thing with our

656
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:12,714
enormous head.

657
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:16,503
MMM.

658
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,790
You can see the visibility here.
I can,

659
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:21,410
I can see so well that I can't
tell my phone is in the picture.

660
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,133
MMM.

661
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,690
And so some of these are relevant to our
suits and some of them are relevant to

662
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:31,870
actual suits. One of, uh,

663
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:36,950
one of those things is actual. So
it's, we'll have to be pretty durable.

664
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:38,203
Um,

665
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:43,130
this is my suit in the last week or so
with the mission when you were patching

666
00:43:43,131 --> 00:43:46,960
them up. Uh, so you can see
it gets pretty beat up. Um,

667
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:49,250
and earth lava,

668
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:54,251
while sharp is still not as sharp as
Mars lava weathering is easier here.

669
00:43:56,060 --> 00:44:00,920
Um, so in case any of you ever built
a space suit, make it really tough.

670
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:08,630
Um, lastly, I eenie has happened
in a hazardous environment.

671
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:12,110
No, I'm just kidding. That's not
about a hazardous environment,

672
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:15,630
although that is my crew mate
at the bottom of a pit. Um,

673
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:21,310
so one consideration for setups on
eva is the communication system. Uh,

674
00:44:21,311 --> 00:44:26,311
so because it's important
to have communication at
all times between basically

675
00:44:26,691 --> 00:44:28,700
between earth and Mars,
even though it's delayed,

676
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:34,180
I you will need some way to explore all
of the varieties of terrain on Mars,

677
00:44:35,341 --> 00:44:39,180
especially lava tubes because those are
one of the most interesting places on

678
00:44:39,181 --> 00:44:43,500
Mars as a potential habitable,
habitable area.

679
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:45,253
Um,

680
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:51,110
so at the moment I'm relaying to have
calm what my crew mate in the pit says to

681
00:44:51,391 --> 00:44:55,290
me and he's relaying for
the team down the tube. Uh,

682
00:44:56,370 --> 00:45:00,030
and so communication,
something to be solved.

683
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:06,480
So the mission ended on September 17th.

684
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:10,320
We were in there for 242 days total.
Um,

685
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:14,490
six people went in the same six people
went out. So that's a success in my book.

686
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:18,240
All right. And we built a team
from this group of strangers

687
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,930
and I'm happy to take questions.

688
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:36,040
Please use the microphones if that's okay.
Thanks for sharing.

689
00:45:36,610 --> 00:45:41,470
Um, so you mentioned that part of mission
five was about team selection. Also.

690
00:45:41,471 --> 00:45:44,320
Can you tell us a little
about the selection process?

691
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:45,650
Sure.
Um,

692
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:51,340
so what I can tell you what I
experienced from the selection process.

693
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,780
Um,
so the,

694
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:59,680
the first step that actually involve
my interaction was a whole bunch of

695
00:46:01,041 --> 00:46:02,210
psychological surveys.

696
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:07,600
So things like everything from what time
of day you like to be awake to how you

697
00:46:09,321 --> 00:46:13,940
cope with stress. Um, just a
whole bunch of different screens.

698
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:17,570
Uh, the second part was
an asynchronous interview,

699
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:20,900
so it was a system where
it asks you questions,

700
00:46:20,901 --> 00:46:24,830
you have something like a minute to
think in, three minutes to record. Um,

701
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:26,030
and that was the process.

702
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,510
There was six people.

703
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:37,180
Can you go down into how
goals six people operate you?

704
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:42,190
Do I pray this single crew of six or
very good broken down into like Tucson

705
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:43,693
fees?

706
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,590
Was there any hierarchy like sort of
like gene bleed that drive 70 bucks?

707
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:54,270
Yeah. Um, so I'll answer
your last question first.

708
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,850
We had a commander that was
the extent of her hierarchy.

709
00:46:56,851 --> 00:47:01,650
So commander everyone else. Um, the,

710
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:06,570
for the most part we found that sort of
formal authority not to be necessary.

711
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:08,310
We did most stuff by consensus.

712
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:14,090
The exception was eva where we found
a formal chain of command to be really

713
00:47:14,821 --> 00:47:18,690
important for getting things
done effectively and efficiently.

714
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:20,430
Um,

715
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:25,430
so for the most part we operated as in
work for the most part we operated as a

716
00:47:28,231 --> 00:47:29,220
team of six.

717
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:32,710
Sometimes there would be certain people
who are more interested in different

718
00:47:32,711 --> 00:47:35,140
things and we tend to work on them more.
Um,

719
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:40,270
but we saw it as our group responsibility
to complete them one way or the other,

720
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:44,710
whether that was a couple of people that
are interested in volunteer or we all

721
00:47:44,711 --> 00:47:46,600
pitch in.
Um,

722
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:51,490
socially I think people tended
to break up a bit more. Um,

723
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:55,270
so we,
we did spend a lot of time as a group.

724
00:47:55,271 --> 00:47:57,400
We also spend a lot of
time in twos and threes.

725
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:01,510
Thanks for sharing.
Um,

726
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:06,040
can you talk about the
psychological results?

727
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:09,510
You said that that was what they
were studying. Have you guys, um,

728
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:12,410
and I guess they probably haven't,
maybe they haven't released the,

729
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:13,590
the result of publicly,

730
00:48:13,591 --> 00:48:17,820
but at least like qualitative
qualitatively from your perspective,

731
00:48:17,821 --> 00:48:22,340
like how people changed over the
time that you were there? Um,

732
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:26,730
the, the short sad answer is no. Um,

733
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:30,800
both because the research is still ongoing
since the next mission is part of it.

734
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:34,010
Um,
and because as a participant,

735
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:37,940
I'm not privy to the
researchers conclusions yet. Um,

736
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:42,200
they'll publish and probably a couple
of years once the next mission has done.

737
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:43,993
Um,

738
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:49,420
I know that personally I think I became
more independent person as a result of

739
00:48:50,751 --> 00:48:52,250
the mission.
Um,

740
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:56,180
I definitely improved
my interpersonal skills.

741
00:48:57,550 --> 00:49:00,830
Um, but I, I can't say anything
about broader conclusions.

742
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:09,180
Hi,

743
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:09,961
thank you for sharing.

744
00:49:09,961 --> 00:49:13,090
It's been really interesting
hearing about your experiences. Um,

745
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:16,610
I'm curious to know what's next
for you now that you've come back,

746
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:20,910
what are you up to? What's your next step?
Um, that's a, that's a great question.

747
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:23,100
I'll let you know.

748
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:28,020
Do you have any specific interests?

749
00:49:28,021 --> 00:49:31,790
Are you exploring a wide
variety of different, um,

750
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:35,130
I,
I definitely would like to continue,

751
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:38,820
continue contributing to space
exploration in one form or another. Um,

752
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:41,580
whether that's through work,
studying, volunteering.

753
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:52,380
I was a question about your drone project.

754
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:57,110
So was that useful because it was higher
resolution than like satellite images

755
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:01,620
because twin was like shifting on
my list because what a terrain would

756
00:50:01,621 --> 00:50:04,770
potentially be like changing on Mars.
Um,

757
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:07,650
so for us we found it
useful exactly as you say,

758
00:50:07,651 --> 00:50:10,530
because it's much higher resolution.
Um,

759
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:14,930
and also because it's
targeted. So, um, right.

760
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,260
I can't say we were successful,

761
00:50:16,261 --> 00:50:19,640
but at one point we tried to search
for a wast water bottle for example,

762
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:23,950
had fallen down someone's
pants leg and um, we,

763
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:28,580
we didn't recover it. We did find a Bush
that was surprisingly similar in color.

764
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:35,900
Yeah.
But mainly because we could,

765
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,600
we could go get images of
what we wanted and they were,

766
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:43,160
they were much higher resolution,
satellite imagery, the imagery,

767
00:50:43,161 --> 00:50:47,750
and interestingly often easier to spot
things on. Then when we went in person.

768
00:50:48,370 --> 00:50:49,730
Uh, so for example, there was,

769
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:54,910
there was one feature where it had a I a
shape that was not really noticeable on

770
00:50:59,511 --> 00:51:03,590
the ground because it's sort of in the,
the subtleties of how the rocks fall,

771
00:51:03,591 --> 00:51:06,290
but it's really easy to
spot from an aerial image.

772
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:11,110
So yeah, it filled the gap
between ground and satellite.

773
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:13,980
What surprised you most about your time?

774
00:51:18,270 --> 00:51:20,080
Um,
that's a good question.

775
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:23,880
I have no idea about most.

776
00:51:23,881 --> 00:51:28,881
But one thing that surprised me was how
accustomed I got to the communications

777
00:51:29,131 --> 00:51:30,960
delay.
Um,

778
00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:35,990
so I was expecting it to be weird to
come out in a lot of ways and it ended up

779
00:51:36,481 --> 00:51:40,290
feeling pretty normal except
for instant communication.

780
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:44,910
So we're so used to, you
know, you send an email,

781
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:48,640
the person doesn't even
get it for 20 minutes. Um,

782
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:53,010
and so I'd send emails and get a response
back in two minutes and it felt creepy,

783
00:51:55,530 --> 00:52:00,190
like in the, I didn't know you
were looking kind of way. Um, yeah.

784
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,210
So that surprised me.

785
00:52:04,270 --> 00:52:09,270
How did this experience affect your
relationships with friends and family? Uh,

786
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:13,780
when earth, so to speak, both
during and after this experience.

787
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,440
That's a good question.
Um,

788
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:22,430
so I think that the mission was
particularly tough for me in that regard,

789
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:26,640
um, because I got married about
four months before the mission.

790
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:30,090
Um,
so

791
00:52:32,730 --> 00:52:35,280
I guess in a way I'm,

792
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:40,380
I'm still discovering the ways in which
relationships have changed, but it was,

793
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:45,870
it was definitely a challenge for me
and my husband to figure out how to,

794
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:51,320
how to be supportive of each other when
being an immediate emotional support or

795
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:57,540
person to vent to isn't really an option.
Um,

796
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:01,110
and figuring out ways to stay connected.
So for example,

797
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:04,200
we had a few movie date night,

798
00:53:04,201 --> 00:53:08,430
so we'd set a time to start a movie
and then send a bunch of email back and

799
00:53:08,431 --> 00:53:11,580
forth during. So it's still delayed,
but if you send enough of it,

800
00:53:11,581 --> 00:53:12,780
it sort of feels like you're chatting.

801
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:20,830
Hi. Thank you for sharing. Um,

802
00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:26,010
what kind of personal effects read aloud
to bring and kind of on the same note,

803
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:29,910
uh, what did you miss most when you
got there and now that you're back,

804
00:53:29,911 --> 00:53:31,650
what do you miss most about being there?

805
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,130
Okay.
Um,

806
00:53:33,131 --> 00:53:38,131
so we were allowed to bring two
suitcases of anything except food.

807
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:41,020
Um, though I smuggled in
some astronaut ice cream,

808
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:46,030
so I brought a suitcase of clothes,

809
00:53:46,031 --> 00:53:47,890
mostly warm clothes.

810
00:53:47,950 --> 00:53:51,140
I have a suitcase of craft
supplies and a bio Lynn.

811
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:55,450
Um,
different people made different choices.

812
00:53:56,290 --> 00:54:01,290
I think what I miss the most besides
obviously people while I was there was

813
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:05,860
probably fruit.
Um,

814
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:07,870
and I,

815
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:12,970
I would definitely say I miss my
crew most now that I'm back. Um,

816
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:17,550
but again, people is kind of a cop
out. So I guess I'd say I miss the, uh,

817
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:21,040
we had a really a really
nicely scheduled by,

818
00:54:21,070 --> 00:54:23,830
so it was pretty consistent. It was, um,

819
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:27,280
we had a tool that we use to
communicate what we were doing. Uh,

820
00:54:27,281 --> 00:54:29,590
that meant that every
minute of the day was,

821
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:34,560
we knew what we were supposed to be
doing. Um, including pre sleep posts,

822
00:54:34,561 --> 00:54:38,410
sleep, lunch, they hit, it was
all scheduled in there. Um,

823
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:42,940
so I think having that,
that tool and that structure to my day.

824
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:47,713
Right.

825
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:53,360
Thank you very much. Laura.
This was fantastic talk. Um,

826
00:54:54,370 --> 00:54:56,970
that's it for questions, but, um,

827
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,320
I assume you're going to hang around
for a little bit of, can run it,

828
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:00,293
talk to you offline,

829
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:04,440
and we encourage you to stay for the APE
team coming up next to talk about your

830
00:55:04,441 --> 00:55:06,240
machine learning resource
here in New York.
