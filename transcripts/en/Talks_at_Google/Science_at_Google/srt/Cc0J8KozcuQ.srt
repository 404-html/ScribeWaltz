1
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:09,310
Without further ado, please
help me. Welcome Joe. Thank you.

2
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,160
So thank you. Thank you, Mary for the,

3
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,710
for the great introduction
texts that everybody at Google.

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,880
And also I wanted to take my longtime
colleague, Terry Fong, who kind of, uh,

5
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,710
with along with Mary manages the,

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,090
the NASA Google relationship for inviting
me to give this presentation. So I'm,

7
00:00:29,091 --> 00:00:31,370
I'm, I'm thrilled to be here. This
is actually my first time on the,

8
00:00:31,371 --> 00:00:32,720
on the Google campus.

9
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:36,470
And so I've obviously everybody
has read and heard a lot about it,

10
00:00:36,471 --> 00:00:39,620
but to actually see it in action
is, is wonderful for me. Um,

11
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:43,980
I'm going to talk a little bit about,
uh, the Mars sample return mission. Uh,

12
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,930
it's an idea that we've had at NASA for,

13
00:00:45,931 --> 00:00:50,931
for quite some time and we're actually
ever so slowly inching our way toward,

14
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:51,920
toward executing it.

15
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,640
And I wanted to talk particularly about
the technologies that are necessary to

16
00:00:55,641 --> 00:00:57,810
do it.
You'll see a few charts downstream.

17
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,470
I'm going to show you all the video
that's kind of an animation of Mars sample

18
00:01:00,471 --> 00:01:04,070
return. And you're going to see a few
places where we're miracles are necessary.

19
00:01:04,071 --> 00:01:06,590
You'll, you'll, you'll, you'll know what
I mean when you see it on the, on the,

20
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:07,483
on the animation.

21
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,150
And that's code for we need to develop
the technology to do whatever it is that

22
00:01:11,151 --> 00:01:13,820
we're trying, trying to do. So
when you'll see that you'll,

23
00:01:13,821 --> 00:01:17,780
you'll see that this mission is an
incredible system engineering challenge.

24
00:01:17,781 --> 00:01:21,680
It's like doing Apollo with no astronauts.
We even, it even includes, you know,

25
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:24,140
going to another planet,
landing, doing some stuff.

26
00:01:24,141 --> 00:01:27,590
They're launching into orbit
around that planet and coming back.

27
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:30,380
So it's very analogous to what we
did at the moon wood with Apollo.

28
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:34,400
But there's no humans involved,
at least not directly. Um, and to,

29
00:01:34,401 --> 00:01:38,000
to imagine doing all the things that
we did in the Apollo with no humans is,

30
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:41,600
is quite an undertaking. So without
further ado, let me launch into charts.

31
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:45,990
I'm going to try to run till about 45
past the hour and Mary will give me a cue

32
00:01:45,991 --> 00:01:50,240
to wrap it up and then we can, um, we can
have a little bit of of interaction on,

33
00:01:50,241 --> 00:01:51,770
on a question.
She went to a,

34
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,790
and I also understand there's a number
of people watching this online and I'm

35
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:59,210
not sure if there's a mechanism for them
to be able to ask questions, but uh,

36
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:04,250
they, they can get in touch with
me. Okay. So, so Mary are at Google.

37
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,760
Um, if you want to ask a question
and you're online, you're not in,

38
00:02:06,761 --> 00:02:10,790
in the room here, so let me go
ahead and get, get going and we'll,

39
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:13,370
we'll work it out as we,
as we go.

40
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,520
So I'm a little bit of an
overview and by the way,

41
00:02:16,521 --> 00:02:21,500
my slides are going to be graphics
heavy and texts, uh, light. Uh,

42
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,620
so we can, we can talk about
the, the, the core stuff in a,

43
00:02:24,621 --> 00:02:27,620
and I have a number of videos that I
want to show you and I'm going to, um,

44
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:32,090
in order for me to talk comprehensively
about Msr, it takes about four hours.

45
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,700
And so we only have less than one then.

46
00:02:34,701 --> 00:02:37,610
So I've had to be a little bit selective
and I instead of trying to like give

47
00:02:37,611 --> 00:02:38,930
you a shallow view of everything,

48
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,900
I've chosen a few things that I really
want to dive in and talk about it and I

49
00:02:41,901 --> 00:02:44,690
think that's a better experience
for you and it's fun to talk about.

50
00:02:44,691 --> 00:02:46,520
And if you're still interested,

51
00:02:46,521 --> 00:02:50,480
I gave Maria a longer version of this
presentation that has more information in

52
00:02:50,481 --> 00:02:54,860
it and you're welcome to peruse that and
I have my contact information anyway.

53
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,860
I'll give you a little bit of context
for what we're trying to accomplish with

54
00:02:57,861 --> 00:03:02,290
the Mars exploration program
that's in instantiated at NASA now.

55
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,060
And when I talk about Mars exploration,

56
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:09,070
I'm going to talk mostly about the robotic
exploration on Mars using rovers and

57
00:03:09,071 --> 00:03:09,904
orbiters.

58
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,860
Obviously there's a big effort at NASA
associated with preparing for humans to

59
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:18,430
go to Mars. Um, I'll touch
on that peripherally at the
end of the presentation,

60
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:22,810
but most of my talk is about doing this
with rovers and orbiters and so forth.

61
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:26,800
So talk a little bit about the context
for for exploration and what is it that

62
00:03:26,801 --> 00:03:28,630
we're trying to accomplish
as a blend of science,

63
00:03:28,631 --> 00:03:33,220
technology and inspiration and which
I think is a product that we at NASA

64
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:37,480
sometimes don't appreciate how much we're
delivering that along with delivering

65
00:03:37,481 --> 00:03:39,880
science and technology.
Talk a little bit about this,

66
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:43,390
this a Mars sample return mission
and then talk about some of the key

67
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:46,930
technologies that include things like
how we get the samples off the surface of

68
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:47,680
Mars,

69
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,550
how we kind of gobble up this thing that's
a size of a basketball and Mars orbit

70
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,200
and bring it back to Earth.

71
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,090
I want to talk about in
particular a really cool
application for superconductors

72
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,790
to assist us in the,

73
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:02,830
in the sort of trapping of of this
basketball and Moore's orb is called flux

74
00:04:02,831 --> 00:04:06,350
painting and then I want to talk a
little bit about the fact that the marsh

75
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:09,520
samples, we have a love hate
relationship with them. There are,

76
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,480
there are Frenemies,

77
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,440
I guess we want to study them and we
want to bring them back to earth and

78
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:15,550
studying our laboratories.

79
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,760
But we also have to account for the
possibility that there might be biological

80
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:25,180
activity in those samples and therefore
we need to treat them as if they're

81
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:30,181
potentially hazard and not release these
things into the Earth's biosphere until

82
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,470
we've made sure that it's safe.

83
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:36,340
And this love hate relationship with the
sample actually drives the engineering

84
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,300
of the mission.
And I'll talk more about that and now,

85
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,140
and then at the end if
we do have any time,

86
00:04:41,141 --> 00:04:45,010
we'll talk about some of the longer term
stuff like flying helicopters at Mars

87
00:04:45,011 --> 00:04:46,690
and I'm landing on a,

88
00:04:46,691 --> 00:04:50,380
on a pinpoint where right now we land with
miles of uncertainty of where we land,

89
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:55,540
etc. So that's kind of the,
the, the, the outline. So let
me talk a little bit about,

90
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:58,270
about context and I won't go
through this point by point,

91
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,760
but I just wanted to make
the point that we, um,

92
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:06,140
within NASA there are sort of four
major organizations that, that are,

93
00:05:06,141 --> 00:05:08,290
are responsible for the NASA missions.

94
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,770
There's one that's responsible
for aeronautics so that
one of the A's and NASA

95
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:12,610
stands for aeronautics.

96
00:05:12,611 --> 00:05:15,520
Even though I think NASA as much
more better known for the space side.

97
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,420
Within the space domain, we have the
human exploration and operations.

98
00:05:19,421 --> 00:05:22,960
Those are the guys who operate this
international space station and are

99
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:24,670
preparing to send humans to Mars.

100
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,670
There is a space technology
mission directorate,

101
00:05:27,671 --> 00:05:30,940
which as the name implies is responsible
for developing new technologies that

102
00:05:30,941 --> 00:05:33,310
can be applied across the
board and NASA and beyond.

103
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,480
And then there's what we call the Science
Mission Directorate in the Science

104
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,240
Mission Directorate is responsible for
delivering science results like you're

105
00:05:40,241 --> 00:05:43,540
seeing from Hubble space telescope like
you're saying from the Mars Rovers.

106
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,400
And that's the,
the,

107
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:48,490
the mission directorate that that
operates the NASA Mars missions.

108
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,830
So we have,
you know,

109
00:05:50,831 --> 00:05:55,831
countless journal articles and papers and
covers of nature magazine and so forth

110
00:05:56,861 --> 00:06:00,110
that that have resulted from,
from the exploration of Mars.

111
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:04,400
And so we've delivered a
really wide variety of key
science findings like before

112
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:06,500
the Mars exploration program began.

113
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,930
We didn't really know how
pervasive water wasn't Mars.

114
00:06:08,931 --> 00:06:13,310
And it turns out their water has been
extremely pervasive at Mars in the ancient

115
00:06:13,311 --> 00:06:13,701
times.

116
00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:18,701
It was wet and warm and
much more habitable for the
kinds of life that we are

117
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:21,380
familiar with on earth.

118
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,170
And then something happened and
all of that water went away.

119
00:06:24,171 --> 00:06:29,030
And Mars has now this dry cold desert.
And because earth and Mars are kind of

120
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,980
brother and sister in, in
the, in the planetary family,

121
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,540
it would be really nice
for us to understand what
happened to all of that water

122
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,790
on Mars. Why did escape and, um,

123
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:44,480
if you're selfish and you don't want it
to happen to you in Earth or maybe your,

124
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,710
your grandchildren's grandchildren's
grandchildren downstream,

125
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,020
it'd be really nice to understand that.
So science is a,

126
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,660
is a big aspect of what we do.

127
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:58,160
Tick engineering and
technology development is
another big aspect of what the

128
00:06:58,161 --> 00:07:02,230
Mars program delivers back to not only
NASA but to the world at large. Um,

129
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,600
many of the autonomous systems that are
now being implemented in driverless cars

130
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:11,570
got their start as NASA tried to figure
out how to operate rovers on the surface

131
00:07:11,571 --> 00:07:15,010
of another planet where we couldn't
have direct human intervention.

132
00:07:15,011 --> 00:07:17,780
And Terry is one of the
world's experts in that field.

133
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:22,781
And I hope one day he mans up and a and
comes and gives a talk here at Google on

134
00:07:22,941 --> 00:07:26,880
all of the cool stuff that he's been
working on with his colleagues at Ames.

135
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:31,570
I'm sorry for a little internal joke.
Anyway,

136
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,330
we were developing a whole
variety of technologies that
not only serve, you know,

137
00:07:35,331 --> 00:07:38,900
sort of a localized NASA interests,
like landing more stuff on Mars,

138
00:07:38,901 --> 00:07:40,730
which is a very specialized application,
but things that,

139
00:07:40,731 --> 00:07:44,080
that helped the world at large.
And then the last one, and, and,

140
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:46,640
and like I said it in some
of my colleagues at Nasa,

141
00:07:46,641 --> 00:07:49,400
they want to talk about the science
and they want to talk about the sort of

142
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:50,620
technology as applies submissions.

143
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,510
But I think that one of our
greatest products is inspiration.

144
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:58,300
And for me it was
unbelievable to be at JPL. Uh,

145
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:02,300
the night that we landed curiosity. And
to see that in Times Square Times Square,

146
00:08:02,301 --> 00:08:05,780
it was lit up with the images
that were coming back from Mars.

147
00:08:05,781 --> 00:08:09,800
And when those first, the landing itself
was sort of a technological achievement.

148
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,060
But when those first thumbnail images
came back and we knew we were safe on

149
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:15,950
Morris,
that was a human story.

150
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:18,140
That was the story of all the
people through their lives.

151
00:08:18,141 --> 00:08:21,590
And you guys know what this is like
to work long hours, nights, weekends,

152
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,640
and feel like personally responsible
for the success. In our case missions,

153
00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:29,060
you're in your case products or something
that may Google is trying to develop,

154
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,780
but that notion that you've invested
in yourself personally and something no

155
00:08:32,781 --> 00:08:37,040
machine can ever,
ever take away that human inspiration.

156
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:39,980
So I think that's one of the
major products that we deliver.

157
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,530
Coming back to science,
um,

158
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,580
there's kind of four things to organize
our scientific exploration of Mars

159
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,980
number one. And you know,
these are written as if they're
like equals, but they're,

160
00:08:49,981 --> 00:08:53,270
they're actually not finding
funny life is the big one.

161
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:57,050
It's the first among equals. That's,
that's the one that, you know, if, if,

162
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,190
if we were to find life,
even microbial life,

163
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:03,510
either evidence of it in the ancient
history of Morrison kind of fossilized

164
00:09:03,511 --> 00:09:07,030
context or extent life,
um,

165
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,550
that would be just a unbelievable change
in the way in which people on earth

166
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,960
think of themselves and think of us as
not being alone in this, in this universe.

167
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,390
I'm not to be downplayed or
are the other goals. Like,

168
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,790
you know, I talked a
little bit about the, the,

169
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,080
the processes and the history
of the climate on Mars.

170
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,430
So even if you could care less about as
an ethereal discussion about whether or

171
00:09:29,431 --> 00:09:30,810
not there's life on another planet,

172
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:34,420
maybe if you're a little
more self centered or are
thinking about the future for

173
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,480
your kids and kids and his kids.

174
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,600
And I'm just this notion of Le
Let's not let happen to Earth.

175
00:09:39,601 --> 00:09:44,280
What happened to Mars? Understanding,
um, how the surface of Mars,

176
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:44,720
uh,

177
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,720
evolve in the interior of Mars that is
actually vastly different from Earth's.

178
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:53,310
And one advantage that we have, the
earth is constantly reinventing itself.

179
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:56,190
The earth. We have these
play, these tectonic plates.

180
00:09:56,191 --> 00:09:59,520
I keep moving around and changing
things and there's constant upwellings.

181
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,630
I'm in the ocean and on on
land and things get recycled.

182
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:06,900
So something that's been on the surface
of the earth a million years ago is

183
00:10:06,901 --> 00:10:09,030
almost certainly not on the
surface of the earth anymore.

184
00:10:09,031 --> 00:10:11,790
It's been somehow turn underneath.
Mars is not like that.

185
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:14,220
Maurice has been very stable for
millions and millions of years.

186
00:10:14,221 --> 00:10:17,220
So you have things that are on the Mars
surface that have always been on the

187
00:10:17,221 --> 00:10:18,900
Mars surface.
And from a scientific standpoint,

188
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:23,790
it actually makes it a lot easier to
understand the history of Mars than we,

189
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,380
than we enjoy here on earth.

190
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:29,130
And then the last goal from a science
standpoint is preparing for eventual human

191
00:10:29,131 --> 00:10:32,340
exploration. And what we mean
is from a science standpoint,

192
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,230
understand the processes on Mars.

193
00:10:34,231 --> 00:10:38,160
It might affect human explanation and
understand how the atmosphere works.

194
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,820
Understand if as the surface of
Mars is the, what we call regolith,

195
00:10:41,821 --> 00:10:45,550
which is fancy for dirt.
The dirt on Mars is that toxic to humans.

196
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:49,740
So that was a big question we have when
the astronauts went to the moon and it's

197
00:10:49,741 --> 00:10:52,630
even more likely to be an
issue at Mars that that the,

198
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,030
the regolith might actually include some
things that are not healthy for humans

199
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,950
to come in direct contact with.

200
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,560
So getting ready for human
exploration is a big deal.

201
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,310
You guys probably know that you've
been sending rovers to Mars.

202
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:08,880
You may not know that we've kind of
had three styles of these rovers.

203
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,800
The first one was sojourner of which,

204
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:15,830
which flew in in 1997 and it lasted about
90 days on the surface of Mars and it

205
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,860
operated in an area the size of
this room never got outside of that.

206
00:11:19,861 --> 00:11:23,520
It only could talk back to the
base station that was nearby.

207
00:11:23,521 --> 00:11:26,790
So if it ever got very far away it would
lose contact with the base station.

208
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,520
And it was, it was really a
technology demonstration in,

209
00:11:29,521 --> 00:11:34,521
in 1997 so fast forward to 2004
seven years beyond that we send to,

210
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,550
we sent twins spirit and opportunity.

211
00:11:38,551 --> 00:11:43,551
The Mars exploration rovers of those are
about the size of a table and they way

212
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:49,250
in the neighborhood of 300 pounds each
when they land and spirit lasted for

213
00:11:49,651 --> 00:11:53,100
seven years before it got stuck
in sand and the winter came,

214
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:56,530
its solar panels can no longer keep it
warm and we think it froze to death.

215
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,670
However, Opportunity more
than 10 years later, in fact,

216
00:12:00,671 --> 00:12:03,610
12 years now has gone
more than 40 kilometers.

217
00:12:03,611 --> 00:12:06,400
So it's finished a marathon
on the surface of Mars.

218
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:10,720
It was only supposed to last for 90 days
and it always supposed to go for 600

219
00:12:10,721 --> 00:12:15,130
meters and it's now gone
well over 10 40 kilometers.

220
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,980
So what I say is, Oh, we paid too
much of that system. You know,

221
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:22,070
things should have died a long
time ago. Anyway, but that's,

222
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,780
that's how we do it at JPL.
And then finally, curiosity,

223
00:12:25,781 --> 00:12:28,750
which I think almost all of
you are directly familiar with.

224
00:12:28,751 --> 00:12:33,751
We launched it in 2011 it landed in 2012
it's still operating on Mars and it's

225
00:12:33,881 --> 00:12:37,870
one of the things that proved that Mars
was in fact a habitable place because

226
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:41,470
within its first two kilometers of roving,
once it landed at Mars,

227
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:46,480
it rove through a stream bed.
And I mean it's like absolutely no,

228
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,630
no questions asked a stream bed.

229
00:12:49,631 --> 00:12:53,590
So we knew that there was flowing water
on the surface of Mars at some time in

230
00:12:53,591 --> 00:12:57,280
the past and it was direct proof when
curiosity roll through that that stream

231
00:12:57,281 --> 00:13:00,720
bed. Just to give you a sense, we
have not launched these guys yet, uh,

232
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:02,350
to Maura's maybe sometime in the future,

233
00:13:02,351 --> 00:13:05,080
but I just wanted to give you some
context for the size of these systems.

234
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:09,280
So sojourner or size of like
a toaster oven, curiosity,

235
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,890
opportunity and spirit.
The size of the table.

236
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,610
And then curiosity is the size of a,
of an SUV.

237
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:19,120
So it weighs 900 kilograms
was about 2000 pounds.

238
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,880
And if we're going to
ever send humans to Mars,

239
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,790
we now know how to put down
a curiosity class payload.

240
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:27,430
And you don't have to put down a
metric ton onto the surface of Mars.

241
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,080
If we're going to put humans on Mars,

242
00:13:29,081 --> 00:13:33,580
we need to learn how to land like 20 tons
is what a human landing system will be.

243
00:13:33,581 --> 00:13:34,920
So when you had to increase our,

244
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:39,130
our entry descent and landing
capability but at 20 times. Okay,

245
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:44,940
so here is sort of a quickie summary
of everything that's happened since the

246
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,570
turn of the century.
The turn of the Millennium 2001 we've,

247
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:54,750
we've started and we've been flying
a set of rovers and fit we call fixed

248
00:13:56,411 --> 00:13:59,050
landers that that stay
in one place and then,

249
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,530
and then a series of orbiters that
perform a variety of functions.

250
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:06,100
They all have scientific instruments
that are looking down at Mars and asking

251
00:14:06,101 --> 00:14:11,101
questions about the geology or trying
to do laser altimetry so we understand

252
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:14,790
what's going on in that. Some of them were
looking at the atmosphere around Mars.

253
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:15,730
Um,

254
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:20,730
all of our orbiters also do secondary
jobs and include relay and communications

255
00:14:21,281 --> 00:14:24,940
from the rover. So if the rover
had to talk directly back to Earth,

256
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,160
that's a very challenging
communication link.

257
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:31,360
It's a lot easier for the rover to
scored information up to an orbiter which

258
00:14:31,361 --> 00:14:34,380
then can transmit the information
back back to her sleep,

259
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,860
what we call calm relay, communication
relay function, and also these orbiters.

260
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:43,090
Many of the of the recent
ones are equipped with cameras
that look down and they

261
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:46,120
look at places that we might choose to
go in the future and they do what we call

262
00:14:46,121 --> 00:14:50,270
landing site reconnaissance. So they take
pictures and they say, hey, this, this,

263
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:54,290
I mean it's ironic from a,
from a safety of landing standpoint,

264
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,580
you want to land this thing on a nice
flat rock free parking lot or from us.

265
00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:59,840
That's not where the cool science is.

266
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:04,070
A science is up in the mountains and
so you have to find these areas on Mars

267
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:08,640
that have both a safe place to land but
also have good science and your buys.

268
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:09,411
So what you want to fly,

269
00:15:09,411 --> 00:15:11,260
what you want to do is you
want to land in the foothills.

270
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,770
So these reconnaissance orbiter as a kind
of trying to find the foothills where

271
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:19,550
you have a nice safe place to land but
cool stuff very nearby is the idea.

272
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:25,420
And so we've been flying these things
in this mission context since the,

273
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,330
since 2001 a variety of orbiters.

274
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:34,390
Most of them are NASA but there's some
from other countries and including places

275
00:15:34,461 --> 00:15:37,130
like the European space agency
are just collections of countries.

276
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,140
And then here are the rovers.

277
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,680
And then we start to get into the future
of next year we're going to launch one

278
00:15:42,681 --> 00:15:44,150
of our fixed lenders called insight,

279
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:48,870
which is going to explore the interior
geology of Mars. And then, um,

280
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,920
I imagine that you all by virtue of being
interested in space know that space x,

281
00:15:54,171 --> 00:15:55,310
which is a private company,

282
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:58,490
is talking about going to Mars with one
of their own unmanned systems that they

283
00:15:58,491 --> 00:15:59,390
call Red Dragon,

284
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:02,930
which is an adaptation of the capsule
that they are delivering to the space

285
00:16:02,931 --> 00:16:05,720
station now to deliver crew and cargo.

286
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,890
So they're thinking when this chart was
maybe thinking about going in 2018 just

287
00:16:09,891 --> 00:16:10,401
recently,

288
00:16:10,401 --> 00:16:15,380
they've adjusted their plant and now
targeting 2020 is their first mission to

289
00:16:15,381 --> 00:16:20,150
Mars. And they, as you probably also
know, operate, uh, at a different,

290
00:16:20,151 --> 00:16:24,200
in a different risk posture, in a
different mission cadence than NASA does.

291
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,160
They're much more risk
tolerant and they're able to
execute things more quickly

292
00:16:28,161 --> 00:16:29,780
than we are at NASA.

293
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:33,740
And so they're actually talking about
going every opportunity to Mars,

294
00:16:33,741 --> 00:16:38,150
which comes along every 26 months. We
can launch missions to Mars. So I'm,

295
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:42,650
I can't wait to see what space x is
able to accomplish, uh, when they're,

296
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,190
when they're in the position to be able
to land on a routine basis of every

297
00:16:46,191 --> 00:16:48,140
Maura's opportunity.
Um,

298
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:53,540
now I want to transition to the future
and what's going to happen in the 2020s

299
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,440
and beyond.
Um,

300
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:01,010
we have a next Mars rover mission,
call it, we call it Mars 2020.

301
00:17:01,011 --> 00:17:05,990
It'll get a inspirational name soon,
soon. Please send, send in your, uh,

302
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:10,370
your, your entries for that.
But for the time being,

303
00:17:10,371 --> 00:17:14,960
we call it Mars 2020 which
is also a pressure ourselves
to launch the darn thing.

304
00:17:14,961 --> 00:17:19,790
It's 2020 and not in 2022 and then we're
thinking about what's next and what's

305
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:23,850
next is very clearly and unequivocally
Mars sample return in. I'll,

306
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:28,220
I'll talk in the next set of slides about
the fact that we need an orbiter to do

307
00:17:28,221 --> 00:17:28,491
that.

308
00:17:28,491 --> 00:17:31,460
And we need another lander that includes
that rocket that I was talking about

309
00:17:31,461 --> 00:17:33,380
that launches the samples
off the surface of Mars.

310
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,720
And that's a decade of the 2020s.

311
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:39,140
And then downstream from the 2020
is there's a lot more uncertain.

312
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:43,550
We're not clear whether
we'll have developed enough
infrastructure to be serious

313
00:17:43,551 --> 00:17:46,870
about sending humans to
Mars and the 2030s. Um,

314
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:51,910
and so we're hedging a little and thinking
about ideas for either more robotic

315
00:17:52,951 --> 00:17:56,910
missions that are continuing the science
exploration of Mars or if we want to

316
00:17:56,911 --> 00:17:59,130
transition more to supporting
human missions to Mars,

317
00:17:59,131 --> 00:18:02,370
which would also do science, but in
a different, in a different context.

318
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:06,480
So we kind of have a number of pathways
that that we could go in the 30s but for

319
00:18:06,481 --> 00:18:10,270
the 2020 is it's all about
Mars sample return. Um,

320
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,710
Mars sample return is
not a new idea at all.

321
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:17,970
We've been thinking about it since the
1970s this notion of not only going to

322
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:21,690
Mars and doing in situ science with
instruments that are carried on some thing

323
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,100
or bitter rover lander,

324
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:28,460
but actually bringing samples back and
have wide variety of ways of doing that.

325
00:18:28,861 --> 00:18:29,011
I mean,

326
00:18:29,011 --> 00:18:31,470
if you defocus your eyes on what you're
trying to accomplish and you just say,

327
00:18:31,471 --> 00:18:34,350
listen, I want to get a bag
of rocks back from Mars.

328
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,830
You can think about ones that have much
more elaborate roofing systems or you

329
00:18:37,831 --> 00:18:40,440
can think about what we call a
grab sample where you'd land,

330
00:18:40,441 --> 00:18:43,470
he wouldn't rove at all. He just reached
down from wherever you land in a pickup,

331
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:47,220
a handful of this stuff and put it in the,
in the math and you and you launch.

332
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,350
The scientists don't like
that idea by the way.

333
00:18:49,351 --> 00:18:52,140
They want a diverse set of
samples that they have selected,

334
00:18:52,141 --> 00:18:56,950
not just whatever happened
to be underneath the rocket
when it touches down. Um,

335
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,550
but the thing that I really
love about this, uh, uh,

336
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,440
about this slide is number one,

337
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,800
back in the day when they were like
doing these things as paintings,

338
00:19:04,801 --> 00:19:06,360
they actually still reuse things.

339
00:19:06,361 --> 00:19:09,400
So when you look at this one
up here and this one down here,

340
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,150
totally different concepts,
but it's got the same background.

341
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,460
So like somebody copied and background.

342
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,010
The only thing I really love
about this one is, um, if you can

343
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,090
you see right here,

344
00:19:21,091 --> 00:19:24,900
here's the rover with all the samples
and then there's the map over there and

345
00:19:24,901 --> 00:19:28,260
there's this big valley in between and
you can almost like see this question

346
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,780
more coming out of the head
of the rover. Go ahead. Oh No,

347
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:34,050
you're on the other side of the valley.
I'm I ever going to get there.

348
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,670
So I don't know who made that painting,
but they were not Amar system engineer.

349
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:42,360
They were a pure artists. But I love
that. I love that picture. And as I said,

350
00:19:42,361 --> 00:19:46,080
a variety of different ways of,
of doing more sample return,

351
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,020
but it turns out,

352
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:51,300
but when you do defocus your eyes and
think about what it would take to bring

353
00:19:51,301 --> 00:19:54,960
back a sample from Mars, um, there's
kind of four things that you gotta do.

354
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:58,260
You got to get the samples,
you've got to get them off Mars.

355
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,130
You've got to somehow get them,
you know,

356
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:04,740
from that vicinity of Mars back to Earth.
And then once you get them down here,

357
00:20:04,741 --> 00:20:09,390
you have to safely and, and, uh, without
while maintaining scientific integrity,

358
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,770
you know,
you have to study them.

359
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:15,210
So these four functions are
totally independent of any
particular architecture.

360
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:18,990
Um,
and then as we'd like to do at NASA,

361
00:20:18,991 --> 00:20:21,210
we like to split big
problems into small problems.

362
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,800
You start thinking about functions.

363
00:20:22,801 --> 00:20:25,590
These are thinking about what
elements might be able to execute.

364
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:29,280
So in the color coding before we had
these four different things, blue, orange,

365
00:20:29,281 --> 00:20:33,780
green and purple, um, and then you start
to decompose these things into their,

366
00:20:33,781 --> 00:20:35,310
into their various and sundry functions.

367
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,580
And you start to think about specific
systems that might be able to do that.

368
00:20:38,581 --> 00:20:42,540
So for instance, this whole thing about
getting the samples and both by the way,

369
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:45,200
um, here's an, I'll pass
it around. Here's what,

370
00:20:45,201 --> 00:20:47,010
here's a model of the
two that we're going to,

371
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:51,970
to stick the rock cores in and we
will collect some 30 ish of these.

372
00:20:51,971 --> 00:20:53,290
It depends on how the mission goes.

373
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:57,550
We might collect as few as 20 and get
still considered to be a mission success,

374
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,460
but they go into this thing.
So it's about the size of a cigar tube.

375
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,130
The Model I have here is a
purely solid model. There's,

376
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:06,190
they're hollow for the real flight in
implementation and they've got all kinds

377
00:21:06,191 --> 00:21:09,940
of Gizmos and stuff in here. But this
is roughly the size of the sample.

378
00:21:09,941 --> 00:21:14,550
And the sample goes in the, in
the shank here in the shaft. Um,

379
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:20,140
so we, in this context, we envision a
rover that would collect the samples.

380
00:21:20,141 --> 00:21:24,310
I would leave them on the surface of Mars.
We're kind of like a drunken sailor.

381
00:21:24,311 --> 00:21:26,830
And then we collect a sample and
we throw it over our shoulder.

382
00:21:26,831 --> 00:21:29,080
And we just trundle away.
Actually we don't,

383
00:21:29,081 --> 00:21:32,650
we put it down really carefully and we
take a bunch of pictures of it from all

384
00:21:32,651 --> 00:21:36,370
kinds of different directions so we know
exactly where it is to go back to go

385
00:21:36,371 --> 00:21:39,910
back and pick up those tubes and we
pick up those tubes from uh, from uh,

386
00:21:39,911 --> 00:21:44,590
another mission that that flies later
than this caching system that will fly in

387
00:21:44,591 --> 00:21:47,110
20,
20 as part of the 2020 rover system.

388
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,840
And that actually contains
two major elements.

389
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:54,580
One is another rover to go out and pick
up those samples and return them to the

390
00:21:54,581 --> 00:21:57,550
man of the Mars descent vehicle,
which is the rocket that flies on that,

391
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:58,241
on that mission.

392
00:21:58,241 --> 00:22:01,510
So that mission carries a fetch
rover and carries the Mavs rocket.

393
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:06,460
And then we had this thing that's that.
So you've executed the blue stuff,

394
00:22:06,461 --> 00:22:10,600
you've acquired in cash, the samples,
you execute that orange stuff,

395
00:22:10,601 --> 00:22:12,580
you launched samples into Mars' orbit,

396
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:15,460
then you come and you capture
that sample container,

397
00:22:15,461 --> 00:22:19,570
we call it the oss and says basketball
size thing and in return and landed on

398
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:22,330
earth. And we have a variety of different
ideas on how you might land on earth.

399
00:22:22,331 --> 00:22:27,331
But the most common one is that it
goes splat on the desert in Utah and

400
00:22:27,491 --> 00:22:31,540
protecting that sample so we don't break
the egg open and let the samples out is

401
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:33,970
one of the major engineering
challenges associated with this.

402
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,090
And then there's all the stuff
associated with, you know,

403
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,740
opening up the egg and getting
the samples out and studying them.

404
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:46,480
So let's back up for a second and,
and it's, it will be completed.

405
00:22:46,481 --> 00:22:48,160
This was the first question
that I asked when I,

406
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:52,360
when I first encountered the notion of
more sample return over a decade ago in

407
00:22:52,361 --> 00:22:55,750
my careers. And wait a second,
why are we doing this? I mean,

408
00:22:55,751 --> 00:22:59,370
this is a very expensive way to study
these samples. Why don't we just,

409
00:22:59,371 --> 00:23:01,840
if we're going to sink a
lot of money into this,

410
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:06,070
why don't we just sync that money into
making better instruments that can get

411
00:23:06,071 --> 00:23:08,920
the same science that we're trying
to get from our laboratories,

412
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:14,090
but we do it at Mars? Well, it turns
out that that's not really possible. Um,

413
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:19,810
number one was at the, at the way
that we do sample science involves,

414
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,350
um,

415
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:25,350
very complex sample preparation that
involves either hands on or direct human

416
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:31,500
guided slicing and dicing of of things
and preparing specimens for spectroscopy

417
00:23:32,861 --> 00:23:37,600
or microscopy that we just don't
have the technology today to do.

418
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:42,630
So we would not be able to study them
as well using an Institchu instrument as

419
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:46,190
we would back on earth. Um, some of the,

420
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:50,060
these instruments are still
the size of rooms and I mean,

421
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:54,260
I know this is the analogous to, you know,
room sized computers that now, you know,

422
00:23:54,261 --> 00:23:57,500
slip into your pocket. But the reality
is in terms of space exploration,

423
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:02,770
we're still back in the or or laboratory
science for analyzing the samples were

424
00:24:03,201 --> 00:24:04,400
still back in those days where the,

425
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:08,040
where the stuff that you need is the
size of a room. It's not the size of a,

426
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:11,900
of an iPhone or a Google phone.
Um,

427
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,633
lastly,

428
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:19,840
you don't always know what you want
to study and when you do it in situ,

429
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:25,700
the investigations that you can do with
your in situ robot is only as good as

430
00:24:25,701 --> 00:24:29,180
that instrument that you
put on the system. Whereas
if you bring a sample back,

431
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:33,200
it can sit in containment for 20 years
and all of a sudden you've got a new

432
00:24:33,201 --> 00:24:37,010
instrument that's able to do analysis
that we never could do when we first flew

433
00:24:37,011 --> 00:24:40,820
the mission. And that's the case with
the Apollo Moon rocks. They're, they're,

434
00:24:40,821 --> 00:24:44,750
they're, they're housed largely at the
Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.

435
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,630
And then they're distributed
out to investigators.

436
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:52,010
And one of the motivations for the
distribution of these things are new

437
00:24:52,011 --> 00:24:54,080
instrument capabilities
that have come a long,

438
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:57,710
long past when those samples came
back from the moon. So there's,

439
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:01,820
there's ample motivation, um, to
not try to do sample, you know,

440
00:25:01,821 --> 00:25:06,210
to not try to replace the sample return
mission with Jess in situ exploration.

441
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:11,250
Here's a trying to summarize this
sort of three mission context,

442
00:25:11,251 --> 00:25:13,580
but actually then the
next video animation.

443
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:16,380
I'm going to show you guys as
much better at doing this job.

444
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:18,890
We call this a bad chart
because earth is on the bottom.

445
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,550
Mars is on the top and if we really did
this correctly, we would be hanging the,

446
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:26,550
the rover upside down, um, showing
that it's all being done on Mars.

447
00:25:26,551 --> 00:25:30,840
But you see the sort of three mission
thing, Mars 2020 collect sample tubes.

448
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:34,800
You can fly the orbiter and the,
and the lander mission in either order,

449
00:25:34,801 --> 00:25:37,650
it doesn't much matter,
but you have to retrieve the tubes,

450
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:41,250
launch them into Mars' orbit,
collect them and bring them back to Earth.

451
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,690
And hopefully if this video works well,

452
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,010
if we want to understand the potential
for life elsewhere in the solar system,

453
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,920
our neighboring planet,
Mars is a great place to go.

454
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:58,630
Waiting on Mars or rock samples that
hold clues to whether Mars ever had an

455
00:25:58,631 --> 00:26:01,720
environment suitable for small
lifeforms called microbes.

456
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:05,710
Scientists would love to collect these
special rocks and bring them back to

457
00:26:05,711 --> 00:26:09,940
study up close in laboratories here
on earth. However you tackle it.

458
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:13,450
Returning samples from Mars is
definitely a complicated problem,

459
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:17,290
but mission planners are already
testing technologies to make the future

460
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:20,650
possible, so how can we
actually get a sample for Mars?

461
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:25,690
Mission planners have several ideas. One
is to build three different spacecraft,

462
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:27,670
which would work together
like a relay team.

463
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:32,050
The first rover could touch down on the
Martian surface and collect samples by

464
00:26:32,051 --> 00:26:32,980
drilling into rocks

465
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:39,880
and then stashing the samples
and sealed tubes. Once collected,

466
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:43,060
the samples would be placed on
the surface to wait for pickup.

467
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,550
A second rover sent later

468
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:48,510
this follow on rover would
go fetch the samples,

469
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:51,930
load them into a container

470
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,820
and bring it back to a lander
with a small rocket onboard.

471
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:00,000
Once the container was loaded on board,

472
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,600
the rocket would lift off carrying
the samples up into Mars' orbit.

473
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:09,150
Waiting in orbit would be
a third spacecraft and more
butter that could capture

474
00:27:09,151 --> 00:27:10,680
the container and bring it back to her

475
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:17,100
with Mars samples safely back on
earth scientist around the world.

476
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,790
We'll be able to study them in state of
the art laboratories for decades to come.

477
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:26,040
The payoff of a sample return is learning
about the potential for life beyond

478
00:27:26,041 --> 00:27:30,180
our home planet and even whether Mars
has the right environment and resources

479
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,520
for human explorers to
survive there one day.

480
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:43,390
Okay. So that's MSR in a,
in a nutshell with a few,

481
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:46,260
a few miracles mixed in.
So,

482
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:51,520
so you guys may think you have coal jobs.
I got the coolest job.

483
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,660
Okay.

484
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:56,320
They pay me to develop the technologies
to be able to do more sample return.

485
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:59,260
Like I,
I find myself on a daily basis going,

486
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,650
I just got paid all day to think about
Mars Rovers and they asked me to come

487
00:28:02,651 --> 00:28:07,270
back tomorrow and they're gonna pay
me again tomorrow or I'm so lucky. Um,

488
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:13,180
we've had sort of three domains and in
a technology development program and so

489
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:17,050
I'm going to delve much more down
into the details now, um, of,

490
00:28:17,051 --> 00:28:22,051
of technologies to enable Mars sample
return in the 2012 to 2014 timeframe.

491
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:28,240
We were really trying to get that 2020
rover enabled to be able to collect the

492
00:28:28,241 --> 00:28:31,420
samples. So we were working
hard to develop, you know,

493
00:28:31,421 --> 00:28:33,860
the drill that was going to drill
the sample and not, you know,

494
00:28:33,861 --> 00:28:37,060
turn it into powder,
but keeping it on an integral core.

495
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,040
We want it to do what
we call faster viewers,

496
00:28:39,041 --> 00:28:42,820
which is making it sound as the rover
can cover hundreds of meters per day

497
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:46,690
instead of the tens of meters that we
typically do with our Mars rovers today.

498
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,300
And we also,
um,

499
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:53,530
wanted to be able to land more
precisely right now. Um, the,

500
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,900
uh, the MSL mission,
the curiosity mission,

501
00:28:56,410 --> 00:29:01,410
the what we call the landing error lifts
for that was about 10 kilometers by

502
00:29:01,511 --> 00:29:05,440
eight kilometers. And we want to get
down to much closer ones because we can,

503
00:29:05,441 --> 00:29:08,660
as I was saying before, we want to land
close to where the good science is.

504
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,500
So we had to,
within the case of MSL,

505
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:14,910
we got to row for a couple of
years before we really got to um,

506
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:18,610
to the good science. We were fortunate
to encounter that stream bed on the way,

507
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,770
but the,
the actual intention for that mission,

508
00:29:20,771 --> 00:29:24,250
we didn't achieve that until
we had road for two years.

509
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:28,450
So we're trying to be able to reduce
the size of that landing error lips and

510
00:29:28,451 --> 00:29:31,510
land much more precisely. Um, those,

511
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,990
the reason that this is green here is
that those technologies were developed to

512
00:29:34,991 --> 00:29:38,390
the level that they were able to be
infused into the flight mission and there

513
00:29:38,391 --> 00:29:41,530
was all being integrated
into the Mars 2020 mission.

514
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:45,190
And so we'll have all those capabilities
that we didn't have four for MSL.

515
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:49,210
The stuff that's in yellow
is in development. Now
I'm going to talk to much,

516
00:29:49,211 --> 00:29:53,350
much more extensively about that in there
and the remaining minutes that we have

517
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:58,230
have left to develop the math to develop
containment assurance. And then, um,

518
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:01,480
eventually we're going to have to develop
whatever that system is a comes and

519
00:30:01,481 --> 00:30:05,170
lands the samples back back on earth
and doesn't let the, the egg break open.

520
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,650
And then way down stream we'll start
developing technologies that are not

521
00:30:08,651 --> 00:30:12,430
related to, to MSR. And I'm really
going to talk about MSR today.

522
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:16,030
So there's a variety of
technologies necessary.

523
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:19,040
I've touched on a few of them already.
Um,

524
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,770
so I won't spend too
much time on this slide,

525
00:30:20,771 --> 00:30:25,420
but just realize many of them sort
of serve more than one mission in

526
00:30:25,421 --> 00:30:29,170
particularly in the sense that there's
two rovers involved in the sample return

527
00:30:29,171 --> 00:30:32,170
architecture.
Here's what 2020 is all about.

528
00:30:32,171 --> 00:30:34,770
It's highly based on
the curiosity platforms.

529
00:30:34,771 --> 00:30:39,580
So it actually looks very similar to to
curiosity and in fact it was made from

530
00:30:39,581 --> 00:30:41,470
some of the spares from
the curiosity mission.

531
00:30:41,471 --> 00:30:43,890
That's one of the ways we
kept a mission costs down. Um,

532
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:47,620
but it has a completely different science
package on it that's more oriented

533
00:30:47,621 --> 00:30:52,510
toward trying to find evidence of,
um, of life on Mars and collect those,

534
00:30:52,511 --> 00:30:54,320
those samples.
Um,

535
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:58,840
it looks identical and certainly the
architecture of the flight system is the

536
00:30:58,841 --> 00:31:02,830
same. We had this crew stage, that
shepherds vehicle from Earth to Mars.

537
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:07,660
We have a back show,
which is kind of a cover that covers the,

538
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:12,490
the good stuff inside the payload
during the entry into Mars.

539
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:16,120
Then we have this descent stage that
you all have seen that that lowers the

540
00:31:16,121 --> 00:31:18,160
rover down to the surface
and then flies away.

541
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:23,520
The rover itself kind of collapsed down
into Intuit's flat condition before the

542
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:26,800
wheels are deployed.
And in the bottom is the heat shield.

543
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:31,600
That's all the same between MSL and 2020
and it's really just the payload is on

544
00:31:31,601 --> 00:31:33,640
the rover. That's, that's
dramatically different.

545
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:37,810
That's what it looks like when it's all
put together in the clean room at JPL.

546
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,360
Um,
and then as I mentioned before,

547
00:31:40,361 --> 00:31:42,850
we had these key technologies
that we infuse it, the mission.

548
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,010
So we have this model for
technology development.

549
00:31:45,011 --> 00:31:49,000
I mean it's really common across an asset
technology development then infusion

550
00:31:49,001 --> 00:31:53,550
into, into a target
mission application. Um,

551
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:56,320
as I said before,
we were trying to narrow that,

552
00:31:56,321 --> 00:31:59,410
that landing error lips in the
way that we do it for, for 2020.

553
00:31:59,411 --> 00:32:02,800
That's different from MSL cause we had
this things called terrain relative

554
00:32:02,801 --> 00:32:04,610
navigation.
Um,

555
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:08,770
it just didn't come up really in any
of the sort of public discussions about

556
00:32:08,771 --> 00:32:13,090
curiosity. But curiosity really didn't
know very much about where it was landing.

557
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:17,230
We targeted a particular location and we
did our best and navigated through our

558
00:32:17,231 --> 00:32:22,231
best to put the spacecraft there and it
landed very close and I ended within a

559
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:24,820
kilometer of where we were targeting,
which is fantastic,

560
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:30,170
but we didn't have any ability to fly
the vehicle to in a particular direction.

561
00:32:30,171 --> 00:32:32,530
And once we actually had it
underneath the parachute,

562
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,710
it's like you pop the shoot and you're
going to land wherever you land.

563
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:41,100
This is a is intending to allow you to
at least adjust the direction that we go.

564
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:42,890
So we come down,

565
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:47,210
we take 10 quick pictures on the way
down and then we decide what direction

566
00:32:47,211 --> 00:32:50,840
we're going to ask the vehicle to go
and we have a divert capability that's

567
00:32:50,841 --> 00:32:53,000
measured in the hundreds
of meters for this.

568
00:32:53,001 --> 00:32:55,690
So this is exaggerating
the situation won't,

569
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,000
it won't keep us from living in the
mountains, but in Atlanta it's in a, in a,

570
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:01,880
in a more,
in a direction that's more safe.

571
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,090
And then I've been alluding to this
notion that we have a variety of these

572
00:33:05,091 --> 00:33:09,140
sample tubes are going to lay down. We
were going to fly about 40 of them. Um,

573
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,300
we're going to lay them in
in a few different locations.

574
00:33:11,301 --> 00:33:14,480
Probably if things go out the
way we're thinking about it now.

575
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:19,400
And we'll have what we call depots of
tubes where we have maybe 10 tubes in a,

576
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:22,940
in a, not a stack but in a
line that the rover would then,

577
00:33:22,941 --> 00:33:24,590
the Fetch rover would then go and collect.

578
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:27,590
I think you guys have had a
chance to see the sample tubes.

579
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:31,310
This is kind of what it looks at.
The sample looks like inside the tube.

580
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:35,930
And then we have two plugs and seals
that are intended to keep the sample from

581
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:37,700
rattling around during the reentry.

582
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:41,150
And then also a hermetically seal to make
sure that any of the gases are things

583
00:33:41,151 --> 00:33:45,930
that might be in trained in that sample.
Don't, don't get out so that the,

584
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:48,110
the engineering of the
sample tubes themselves,

585
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:50,120
you have a very simple
version of it there.

586
00:33:50,121 --> 00:33:54,110
But the actual samples who was quite
a complex engineering endeavor,

587
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,250
here are some ideas for, um, the,

588
00:33:57,290 --> 00:34:02,220
the architecture of that Sim we call
Samp Srl sample return lander. Um,

589
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:07,330
it could be something that looks like
the curiosity platform and it carries the

590
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:12,400
rocket on its back. The rocket is a
little bit larger than human sizes.

591
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,760
It's about three meters in length and
it weighs different ones that have

592
00:34:16,761 --> 00:34:19,520
different masses,
but it's in the 200 to 300 kilo range.

593
00:34:19,521 --> 00:34:22,390
So it's a little heavier than a human
and a little taller than the human,

594
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,640
but it's roughly that size.
You can have it on your back,

595
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,880
which is great because you're picking
up tubes that you don't have to go back

596
00:34:28,881 --> 00:34:31,400
anywhere and you just, when you, when
you decide you have enough tubes,

597
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,460
you finished loading them into
the map and you launch it or are,

598
00:34:34,461 --> 00:34:37,730
we could have one that has a fixed
platform where the mass stays on that

599
00:34:37,731 --> 00:34:41,960
platform in a smaller rover that's
more the size of spirit or opportunity.

600
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:44,390
Then would go out, collect
the tubes, and then come back.

601
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:46,290
And does that come back part of it that,

602
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:50,270
that has us worried and led us to think
about this thing we call a mobile map,

603
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:53,880
which is, which is the
curiosity class. Um,

604
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:56,150
there was a variety of different,
um,

605
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:00,380
autonomy and visualization technologies
that are, that are being applied.

606
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:03,870
This one is a, is a three
d augmented reality, um,

607
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:07,360
strategy that we're using not just for,
um,

608
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,910
to put ourselves the operators is the
mission and the scientists from the

609
00:35:10,911 --> 00:35:14,120
mission on the surface of Mars so that
they can look around and say, hey,

610
00:35:14,121 --> 00:35:17,030
I really care about this rock, but
I, I love to see it from the other,

611
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:19,370
from the other direction.
And using orbital imagery,

612
00:35:19,371 --> 00:35:22,550
we synthesize full three d imagery of the,

613
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:26,510
of the system so that the operators and
the mission planners can really have a

614
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:29,060
good situational awareness
of what's happening on Mars.

615
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:33,380
But we've even thought about doing that
for like spacecraft assembly where you

616
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,820
know,
when you put the space craft together,

617
00:35:34,821 --> 00:35:37,530
it's really tightly packaged and you know,

618
00:35:37,531 --> 00:35:40,110
you wish that you could just
look inside and see what,

619
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:42,240
what was going on inside there.
And this is a,

620
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:45,810
this is a way to synthesize the
spacecraft in three d that allow you to

621
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:48,650
literally walk through the spacecraft
and see what's going on. Dude,

622
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:54,270
you're the one in interior.
This is that two minute elevator pitch.

623
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:59,460
The other one is that right now the Mars
Rovers, they actually roll quite slowly.

624
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,540
We've,
we've gotten a hundred meters in a day,

625
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:08,670
but that's a very good day of driving
and more frequently we're getting tens of

626
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:11,250
meters per day to do this fetch operation.

627
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:15,030
We're going to eat a lot better
performance out of out of the rover.

628
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:20,210
That's going to have some of the driving
distance is a matter of power and

629
00:36:21,391 --> 00:36:25,620
thermal capability of, of the rover
to survive the cold night at Mars.

630
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:30,360
But a lot of it is that we're just not
smart enough to process the information

631
00:36:30,361 --> 00:36:35,130
quickly enough to allow the rover to
drive and even a walking pace and it would

632
00:36:35,131 --> 00:36:38,200
be wonderful. Right now we're
getting nine meters per day out of,

633
00:36:38,201 --> 00:36:41,520
out of both Mer and MSL. So it's not
a matter of size. Even the rovers,

634
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,320
even though one's much
larger than the other,

635
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:46,080
they're both rolling along at
10 meters per day. On average.

636
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,050
We need about four or five
times that level of performance.

637
00:36:49,051 --> 00:36:53,100
Then we could get it through.
Um, better automation,

638
00:36:53,101 --> 00:36:54,180
better autonomy,

639
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:59,440
better decision making onboard the rover
so it can rove and not have to stop.

640
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,040
You know,
when there's a pebble in it's way.

641
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:05,720
And that's a fantastic application for,

642
00:37:05,721 --> 00:37:09,240
for new technology development in the AI
domain that I think would be great for

643
00:37:09,241 --> 00:37:13,560
this. For this system. I've talked
a little bit about this basketball,

644
00:37:13,561 --> 00:37:14,390
we call it the,

645
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:18,870
the orbiting sample and what you see are
those sample tubes that I passed around.

646
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:22,680
We cluster them and it turns out that
when you kind of package them like a

647
00:37:22,681 --> 00:37:26,400
honeycomb and you can
package either 19 of them in,

648
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:28,140
I think it's four rings,

649
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,500
we're at a fifth ring and you'd get up
to 31 and that's what we're showing here.

650
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,900
33 one,
two.

651
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:39,530
And then that canister gets slid inside
and it makes up a sphere and there,

652
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:43,080
and you'll see in a minute why we want
it to be spherical cause it makes it

653
00:37:43,081 --> 00:37:47,110
easier to, to catch it on orbit.
Um, but just, just, sorry,

654
00:37:47,111 --> 00:37:50,010
I just know that way it's
about the size of a basket.

655
00:37:50,011 --> 00:37:51,900
Basketballs 24 centimeters in diameter.

656
00:37:51,901 --> 00:37:55,380
This is 27 and it weighs about 25 pounds.

657
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:57,570
So it's pretty massive
actually. It's, it's,

658
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:02,100
and it's almost all metal of some
sort of titanium and stainless steel.

659
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:07,200
This is just one concept for a massive
launch where we have the platform and

660
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:11,100
fetched one of the benefits of doing this
versus the Moma Mab is the fetch rover

661
00:38:11,101 --> 00:38:12,990
can kind of back away
and watch the launch.

662
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:17,160
So we get some fantastic video and also
you wouldn't kill Your rover, right?

663
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:19,380
If those are the things launches
off the back of the rover,

664
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:21,330
the rover is not likely
to survive that event.

665
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:26,460
So this is one advantage to the fetch
and fixed platform. And speaking of mass,

666
00:38:26,461 --> 00:38:29,850
we've been looking at a variety of
different rocket technologies to make this

667
00:38:29,851 --> 00:38:30,684
possible.

668
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:34,590
There is solid rockets which are liked
the little Estes rockets that as as a kid

669
00:38:34,591 --> 00:38:39,430
I hope you with. Um, there are
the, the what called by propeller.

670
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:43,090
Rockin switches are analogous to the
space shuttle or what space x as launching

671
00:38:43,091 --> 00:38:46,100
now where you're mixing together
a few on an oxidizer. Um,

672
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:50,530
the hybrid is kind of halfway in between.
It has a solid fuel,

673
00:38:50,531 --> 00:38:52,870
but either a liquid or a gaseous oxidizer.

674
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:54,790
And it turns out for the Mars application,

675
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:59,200
this hybrid is just right because we have
problems with the solids cracking when

676
00:38:59,201 --> 00:38:59,470
they,

677
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:03,760
when they descend in seventh and they
have to encounter the landing environment

678
00:39:03,761 --> 00:39:07,120
that we have. It's also, um,
they're not very good at, at,

679
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:11,180
at cycling thermally hot to
cold during the day. And the,

680
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,210
the hybrid fuels don't have that problem.

681
00:39:13,211 --> 00:39:16,960
So we're looking at at a hybrid
implementation for the math.

682
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:18,640
Okay.

683
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,910
That was the,
the landed system here is the,

684
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:27,180
here is the, the orbiter system that
would collect the, uh, the sample.

685
00:39:27,181 --> 00:39:31,060
It has big solar arrays because it
actually uses what we call solar electric

686
00:39:31,061 --> 00:39:35,670
propulsion. Rather than using chemical
rockets to propel itself, we, um,

687
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:39,700
use solar power to heat up an ionized
gas and then gets ejected out.

688
00:39:39,701 --> 00:39:42,430
The back end is a much more
efficient power source.

689
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:45,310
And this thing called rocks is the,

690
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:49,720
is the package that captures the sample.
I want to talk a little more about that.

691
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:53,530
So the rocks system does this,

692
00:39:53,531 --> 00:39:56,620
basketball is in Maura's orbit
and we, and it's a nerd. Okay.

693
00:39:56,621 --> 00:39:59,320
It has no propulsion system.
So what we do is with the orbiter,

694
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,630
we chase it down and we,

695
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:06,640
we close in on it and we actually find
finally rendezvous with it in the last

696
00:40:06,641 --> 00:40:08,440
sort of hundred meters we closed down.

697
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:14,040
And that that basketball gets put into
some sort of a system that captures it

698
00:40:15,311 --> 00:40:17,200
and contains and, and
I'm, I'm leading you to,

699
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,120
to another technology that
I wanted to show you. Um,

700
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:25,350
we have to then either encapsulate it
because it might have more as material on

701
00:40:25,421 --> 00:40:26,091
the outside.

702
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:28,960
And remember we have to treat that
Mars materials potentially hazardous.

703
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:31,630
And then we,
because we're so afraid of it,

704
00:40:31,631 --> 00:40:36,010
we actually do it twice and we
do do to encapsulation exercises.

705
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:39,040
And then we released that
encapsulated systems somehow,

706
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:42,850
either in the form of a reentry capsule
that lands on the surface or there's

707
00:40:42,851 --> 00:40:43,684
other ideas.

708
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,840
And we've been looking at our
whole variety of different
alternatives to how we

709
00:40:46,841 --> 00:40:49,690
do this rendezvous and capture
it. Summer, very sort of,

710
00:40:49,691 --> 00:40:52,390
let's call them conventional mechanical
things where you fly this thing kind of

711
00:40:52,391 --> 00:40:56,950
into a basket ball and met,
um, that's this one here. Um,

712
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:59,650
and then you close a loop in any
and you drive it through the system.

713
00:40:59,651 --> 00:41:01,750
There's there, there's another one that
I want to show you that in a second.

714
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:03,250
That's,
that's really cool.

715
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:12,580
There's the OSC coming into
the, to the system. Uh,

716
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:18,260
this one actually uses a mechanical
arms to come and trap the OSCE.

717
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,630
Then, uh, just, you know, this is
all still attached to the spacecraft.

718
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:24,690
We just delete it so you
can see what's going on.

719
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:28,950
We reoriented because we care what
orientation those samples land on.

720
00:41:28,951 --> 00:41:33,000
We don't want them to land with the seal
down and be driven through the seal.

721
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,330
So we wanted them to kind
of lay flat when they,

722
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,830
when they land on the earth's surface.

723
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:42,520
Here we're braising brazing
is like soldering. It's kind
of welding the, uh, the,

724
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:45,370
the two halves of the
container that the is,

725
00:41:45,371 --> 00:41:49,790
and then it moves into this thing
that we call the earth entry vehicle.

726
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,300
Um, and we do one other
layer of containment there.

727
00:41:53,301 --> 00:41:56,990
So we have a second layer and you'll
see this sort of hangar door thing flip

728
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,790
open and then the Evie gets ejected.

729
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:05,323
Yeah

730
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:13,040
and that's, that's the whole
sequence of everything that happens.

731
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,520
Punch it off and there you go.

732
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:22,810
So I want it to talk about a really
neat technology called flux pinning.

733
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,410
The one scenario that I
just showed you before we,

734
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:29,110
we capture that oss with mechanical arms.
This one uses,

735
00:42:29,111 --> 00:42:32,830
I'm super conductors and magnets and
it turns out that there was a style of

736
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:36,910
superconductor type two superconductor
that if you take it through its

737
00:42:36,911 --> 00:42:39,340
transition temperature, you
know, at at higher temperatures,

738
00:42:39,341 --> 00:42:43,930
these things just are sort of
a nerd pieces of metal stuff.

739
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:47,530
And then if you cool them down and in
this particular class it's below 80

740
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:50,740
degrees Kelvin,
they become super conductors.

741
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:54,160
And it turns out that if you do these,
these types of superconductors,

742
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:57,160
if you take them through the transition
temperature in the presence of a

743
00:42:57,161 --> 00:42:57,994
permanent magnet,

744
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:02,290
they set up flux fields and these flux
fields are what allow you to levitate

745
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:06,250
this. This is just a regular
permanent magnet, nothing
special about this one. Um,

746
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:10,510
it wants to stay in place there. As long
as you hold that superconductor below.

747
00:43:10,511 --> 00:43:14,830
It's critical temperature in the presence
of the magnetic field and wants to pin

748
00:43:14,831 --> 00:43:16,150
that magnet in place.

749
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:20,320
And that turns out to be extremely
valuable for what we're trying to do.

750
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,170
Um,
on the more sample return.

751
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:27,303
Yeah.

752
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:32,480
So we have, um, an idea that we could
try to characterize this, this, uh,

753
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:37,070
well in order to be able to use it to
capture the OSCE and holding it oriented

754
00:43:37,071 --> 00:43:41,820
in proper position.
So in this context,

755
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,310
the oss would have these permanent
magnets on is on the perimeter, on the,

756
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:50,250
on the outside of the thing,
and it would fly into the spacecraft.

757
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:54,900
And then using superconducting
magnets arrayed in this pattern,

758
00:43:54,901 --> 00:43:57,030
we could actually control the
orientation of the awesome.

759
00:43:57,090 --> 00:43:59,730
Not only would capture it
using the superconductors,

760
00:43:59,731 --> 00:44:01,930
we actually could turn it into a,

761
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:04,950
a preferential orientation
and then trap it down.

762
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:09,320
And I want it to show you just a
couple of videos from a flight. Here's,

763
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,270
here's an operation at Cornell on a,
on a flat table,

764
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:17,020
but I'll also show you a operational,
we just did in,

765
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:19,860
in March on a micro gravity a aircraft.

766
00:44:19,861 --> 00:44:23,730
We flew this thing because on the flat
table we only get three degrees of

767
00:44:23,731 --> 00:44:26,520
freedom, right? It goes x
and Y and you can get y'all,

768
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:30,120
but you're not getting all six degrees.
Is He pitch you on role?

769
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:35,000
So actually this on the uh,
on the micro gravity airplane aware.

770
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:37,843
Okay.

771
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,133
There we go.

772
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:52,850
Okay. Day One before
the guy learns. Don't,

773
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:54,523
don't try to stand

774
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,680
on one of these. Gravel is a
good about 20 seconds. Okay.

775
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:07,400
Anytime we get about three
or four seconds. Good. Zero
days. Let me just show you.

776
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:08,703
Yeah,

777
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:22,150
this is from camera. It's bounded
on the frame. That's mine.

778
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:33,090
I see how it just for a couple seconds
got in there. Everybody was really jagged.

779
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:38,730
Yeah,
there's a particularly good,

780
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:01,523
yeah.

781
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,500
So it turns out there

782
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:13,590
if anything happens, if you
touch any, anything in a plane,

783
00:46:13,591 --> 00:46:16,750
you're no longer together.
Oscar is pouring out.

784
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:20,650
So you'll see how far we actually
translate in the plane in zero g.

785
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:29,090
So we do get to have some fun
every once in a while. Um,

786
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:33,330
and we're thinking about flying this on
the space station in a couple of years

787
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:35,340
and then eventually in,
in Morris,

788
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:40,830
this is simulating the landing of that
Earth entry vehicle on the desert floor

789
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,470
at 3000 g's.

790
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:48,160
And that's on a muddy.

791
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:51,790
It could rain and in the desert and we
were testing and what happens when it

792
00:46:51,791 --> 00:46:56,791
lands in mud and what it does and it
just creates this huge splatter of blood.

793
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:59,470
So I'm showing you the fun stuff,
right? I'm not showing you,

794
00:46:59,471 --> 00:47:02,110
it was me sitting in meetings
all day long and you know,

795
00:47:02,111 --> 00:47:04,160
developing budgets and schedules,
I'm showing anymore.

796
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:08,250
We get to fly on the micro gravity playing
and when we get to make the mud goes

797
00:47:08,251 --> 00:47:10,380
splat.
Okay,

798
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:15,850
so downstream after this we have big
ideas about other systems that could

799
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:19,870
explore Mars, helicopters, balloons,

800
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,370
landing more things,

801
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:28,210
and eventually getting ready for humans.
So sorry for the fast close there,

802
00:47:28,211 --> 00:47:30,460
but there's,
if you're really interested in,

803
00:47:30,461 --> 00:47:33,520
please ask Mary for the slide package
and you can look at it and warranty FTL

804
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:38,530
and I'm happy to talk with you off
offline. All right, thank you very much.

805
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:40,000
I know I hit you with a fire hose.

806
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:40,973
Perfect.

807
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:50,400
I'm wondering with the sort of idea of uh,

808
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:55,390
the magnetic capture, sort
of firstly, what are the,

809
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:58,660
does that have a long enough range
to be practically useful in orbit?

810
00:47:58,661 --> 00:48:02,650
It feels like it would be range
constraint more than a basket and sort of

811
00:48:02,651 --> 00:48:03,101
secondly,

812
00:48:03,101 --> 00:48:07,420
what were the reasons to
use superconducting methods
instead of active control

813
00:48:07,421 --> 00:48:11,790
with a regular little
electromagnet to accomplish
that task? Sure. So first fifth,

814
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:13,870
two fantastic questions.
Number one,

815
00:48:13,871 --> 00:48:17,920
it would be beautiful if this tractor
beam acted over kilometers and you know,

816
00:48:17,921 --> 00:48:22,060
it was just like in Star Trek, but
it acts over centimeters. The good,

817
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:25,520
the good news is we can control the
spacecraft to single digit centimeter.

818
00:48:25,521 --> 00:48:30,521
So I can fly about retrieval system up
to the oss within about five centimeters.

819
00:48:30,801 --> 00:48:33,900
So I only need that
tractor beam quality to,

820
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:37,970
to actuate over single digit centimeters.
And it does that.

821
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,110
That's that aspect of the really
important thing is that we do it without

822
00:48:42,111 --> 00:48:42,771
contacting,

823
00:48:42,771 --> 00:48:46,370
without getting a lot of dust flying
off of the OSCE and contaminating the

824
00:48:46,371 --> 00:48:47,120
spacecraft.
That's,

825
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:50,680
that's the big advantage over the
conventional mechanical muses.

826
00:48:50,681 --> 00:48:54,410
And we never actually touched the awesome
the scenario it comes in and it pins

827
00:48:54,411 --> 00:48:58,820
in that equilibrium condition
with no contact to the spacecraft.

828
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:02,990
And we're able to orient the oss without
touching it. And it turns out that,

829
00:49:02,991 --> 00:49:06,290
that this orientation function
is winding up being a big design.

830
00:49:06,350 --> 00:49:09,440
I didn't think it would be when
we first embarked on this thing,

831
00:49:09,441 --> 00:49:12,740
but it turns out that orientation is
a big design driver for the mechanical

832
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:14,510
systems on.
The second one is,

833
00:49:14,511 --> 00:49:16,970
why do we do it with superconductors
rather than just regular commissional

834
00:49:16,971 --> 00:49:19,400
magnus? You could, but that,

835
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:22,530
that potential well and
that pinning capability in,

836
00:49:22,531 --> 00:49:26,300
in the equilibrium position is a lot
more difficult to synthesize with

837
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:31,310
electromagnets and wants to drive right
into contact with a magnet and stick in

838
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:31,880
contact.

839
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:35,360
Now you can levitate electromagnetically
but it's a lot harder than this.

840
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:36,560
Too much does it passively.

841
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:41,030
So as long as you keep that superconductor
below it's critical temperature.

842
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:44,240
As long as you're keeping it that cold,
you don't have to do anything else.

843
00:49:44,241 --> 00:49:46,550
You don't need an elaborate
control system. It just,

844
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:51,080
it just operates that way as long as
you've pinned the magnet in place. So yes,

845
00:49:51,081 --> 00:49:53,060
you could do it with electromagnets,
but the,

846
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:57,470
the superconductors have a number of
characteristics that are beneficial.

847
00:49:57,530 --> 00:49:59,780
That passive equilibrium position,

848
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:04,100
the non contact case instead of
those things make it advantageous.

849
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,270
The downside is it's a low
technology maturity right now.

850
00:50:08,271 --> 00:50:10,610
And so we're inventing
the technology as we go.

851
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:13,700
Most people have much more experience
obviously with electromagnets,

852
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:15,470
a conventional permanent magnets.

853
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:19,430
So those things are intention
in our development. Thank you.

854
00:50:19,431 --> 00:50:20,510
That's a super question.

855
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:25,340
I actually had a similar question but I'll
go with a different one cause you, uh,

856
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,310
you answered my first one.
I'd to know a little bit about,

857
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:33,110
um, the relationship between NASA and
space x and how much coordination there is

858
00:50:33,111 --> 00:50:36,620
between the two organizations and
how much competition there might be.

859
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:40,660
Yeah. Uh, another, another
great question and I'll,

860
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:45,750
and I'll going to do my best to be a
candid but with a little bit of diplomacy.

861
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:51,150
So, um, number one is, as I mentioned
to you on, you know, really,

862
00:50:51,151 --> 00:50:54,420
really impressed with all the things
that space x has been able to accomplish.

863
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:57,090
Um, we, uh, especially at JPL,

864
00:50:57,091 --> 00:51:00,840
but Nasa Ames also has a
relationship with space x. Um,

865
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:05,460
we're helping them do some of the
things that they really can't do for

866
00:51:05,461 --> 00:51:06,211
themselves.
Like for instance,

867
00:51:06,211 --> 00:51:10,710
we're talking with them about some of the
really technical aspects of the entry,

868
00:51:10,711 --> 00:51:14,130
descent and landing environment so that
they understand some of the lessons that

869
00:51:14,131 --> 00:51:18,150
we learned the hard way without having
to repeat them. And so we're off.

870
00:51:18,151 --> 00:51:23,070
We're providing them with some engineering
support as they develop their system.

871
00:51:23,071 --> 00:51:25,290
And then there's other areas where
they're not looking for that support.

872
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:26,580
They think they have the answer and they,

873
00:51:26,581 --> 00:51:30,330
and they may even have the personnel
that have the experience that are able to

874
00:51:30,331 --> 00:51:31,164
give them that.

875
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:36,270
So we're supporting them as some very
particular engineering domains in areas

876
00:51:36,271 --> 00:51:40,920
where NASA has clear expertise that
space x does not have in return.

877
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:41,580
Um,

878
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:46,500
there are discussions between space x
and NASA about returning the favor in the

879
00:51:46,501 --> 00:51:50,250
form of landing things for us because
we're only getting opportunities to land

880
00:51:50,251 --> 00:51:53,880
on the Mars surface every half a
decade or so if they're going on every

881
00:51:53,881 --> 00:51:57,540
opportunity to be wonderful if we
could put payloads onto their system.

882
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:01,740
So there's, there's a bit
of an interchange and there,
there are motivations on,

883
00:52:01,741 --> 00:52:05,330
on both sides for, for
that relationship. Um,

884
00:52:05,331 --> 00:52:09,450
one thing I can say is that I think
SpaceX is really changing the paradigm.

885
00:52:09,451 --> 00:52:13,050
They certainly had done it in the launch
vehicle game and I anticipate that as

886
00:52:13,051 --> 00:52:16,930
they spread into other domains
like spacecraft satellites, um,

887
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:18,510
like from Mars applications,

888
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:21,510
they're going to change the paradigm
in the way that they did for launch

889
00:52:21,511 --> 00:52:23,940
vehicles. They're going to change
the paradigm in those other domains.

890
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,600
I happen to be somebody who thinks that
those paradigm changes are good for the

891
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:29,520
ecosystem as a whole.

892
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:34,730
So I'm really a huge fan of space x and
I think most people that you talk to at

893
00:52:34,831 --> 00:52:37,740
JPL aims have sort of
a similar perspective.

894
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:43,580
So I'm somewhat curious if there's been
any lessons learned from rubber attempts

895
00:52:44,111 --> 00:52:47,410
of like other countries and uh,
because you know,

896
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,530
most of what we see is coming
from NASA or maybe space x,

897
00:52:50,531 --> 00:52:55,320
but we don't see much coming
at least, uh, publicized from,

898
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:56,410
from the other countries,

899
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:02,080
right. In the domain of
Mars exploration. Um,

900
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:05,510
particularly when we talk about
landing things on Mars and,

901
00:53:05,511 --> 00:53:06,790
and using them on Morris,

902
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:11,360
the u s is kind of the only
player that's been successful. Um,

903
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:12,460
we actually have a very,

904
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:15,880
one of the slides that I didn't show
you guys today is we have a scorecard of

905
00:53:15,881 --> 00:53:20,881
successful attempts versus successes and
it's like 39 at Townson 15 successes.

906
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:25,590
And almost all of those successes are us.
No one,

907
00:53:25,591 --> 00:53:30,591
no other country has successfully landed
something on Mars that lasted for more

908
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:31,121
than a few seconds.

909
00:53:31,121 --> 00:53:34,890
The Russians landed something that
died in a matter of seconds. Um, we,

910
00:53:34,891 --> 00:53:37,250
the only the only country
that's ever had anything that,

911
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:40,500
that really delivered science back from
the surface of Mars is the United States.

912
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:44,520
Now, that's not to say that we don't
have wonderful collaborations with other

913
00:53:44,521 --> 00:53:48,630
international partners like the European
Space Agency that are providing things

914
00:53:48,631 --> 00:53:49,740
on the instrument level,

915
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:54,030
and they're now getting to the point
of trying to do things like rovers.

916
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:59,360
The Europeans are planning to launch a
rover mission in 2020 that would sort of

917
00:53:59,641 --> 00:54:03,950
look like spirit and opportunity
in terms of its ambitions for,

918
00:54:03,951 --> 00:54:06,000
for size and roving,
distance and so forth.

919
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:10,650
But no one's really yet been successful
at the, let's call it the mission level.

920
00:54:10,970 --> 00:54:12,600
Um, uh, other than NASA.

921
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,320
So right now the collaborations
are at the instrument level,

922
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:20,640
but I'm the mission level. We're still
waiting for them to catch up. Um,

923
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:23,760
I'm wondering why you have
the second rover at all.

924
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:27,930
I mean if you just kept all the things
on the first rover and you say the rocket

925
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:30,630
that's coming is going to be able
to land, you know, on a dime.

926
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,480
We're not just land next to it.
Yeah,

927
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:38,450
I guess I'm never going to get
an easy questions for you guys.

928
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:45,200
Very insightful question and yes you
could do this with one single landed

929
00:54:46,141 --> 00:54:46,471
element,

930
00:54:46,471 --> 00:54:51,471
but let me explain technical motivations
and also allude to some programmatic or

931
00:54:51,641 --> 00:54:52,474
motivations.

932
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:55,800
Technically the mission that it's going
to take to collect those samples are

933
00:54:55,801 --> 00:54:58,890
going to take a couple of
years on the Mars surface.

934
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:01,370
And while we've had,
you know,

935
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:06,570
we've had great success spirit lasted
seven years. Opportunity is, is 12 years,

936
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:11,400
curiosity is now when it's what,
fifth year, six year of operation.

937
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:14,760
We can't count on those
super long mission durations,

938
00:55:14,761 --> 00:55:16,530
particularly the solar power systems.

939
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:20,070
If they ever get themselves
in a conditioning where
they're sort of stuck and

940
00:55:20,071 --> 00:55:23,520
they can't point, there were rays at the
sun over the winter, the Mars winter,

941
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:24,900
they freeze to death.

942
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:30,380
So we're very reluctant to bake into our
mission planning multi year missions.

943
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:35,520
And we think that that collection process
is going to take a couple of years,

944
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:39,510
and so it kind of eats up the amount of
time that we're willing to allocate to a

945
00:55:39,511 --> 00:55:43,240
single mission. Um, the
collection operation,

946
00:55:43,241 --> 00:55:46,560
it actually takes less
time then the sample.

947
00:55:47,570 --> 00:55:48,480
When I say collection,

948
00:55:48,481 --> 00:55:51,510
I mean the fetching operation
at collecting the sample
tubes from the surface

949
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:53,310
takes much less time than the,

950
00:55:53,311 --> 00:55:56,640
than the drilling of the cores and
laying those samples down on the surface.

951
00:55:57,060 --> 00:56:00,960
And we're just nervous that that's too
much to pack into one single mission.

952
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:04,020
That's the technical explanation.

953
00:56:04,021 --> 00:56:08,910
There's a programmatic explanation that
says we're sending the Mars 2020 mission

954
00:56:08,911 --> 00:56:13,080
to Mars to do a fantastic
institchu mission, which by
the way stands on its own.

955
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:15,600
We would send that system,
I believe,

956
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:18,360
regardless of whether or not there
was a sampling package on it.

957
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:22,020
But it's great that we have the sampling
package and we get started on Mars

958
00:56:22,021 --> 00:56:26,470
sample return. Um, and we built
some momentum that says, Hey, um,

959
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:29,950
uh, Congress and the
Congressional Budget Office,

960
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:34,570
we have 33 sample tubes
lying on the surface of Mars.

961
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:38,860
They have unbelievable science
locked inside them, please,

962
00:56:38,861 --> 00:56:40,570
let's go get them and bring them home.

963
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:46,530
That's a compelling story that gets to
be told starting in 2021 when the 2020

964
00:56:47,831 --> 00:56:52,831
rover lands rather than betting on the
come and sending that mission in 2027

965
00:56:53,021 --> 00:56:56,230
2028 and hoping that
you have good samples.

966
00:56:56,620 --> 00:57:00,340
So the opportunity to get started soon
have something that's compelling to bring

967
00:57:00,341 --> 00:57:03,370
back helps to motivate
the rest of the missions.

968
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:06,820
So I told you a technical story and I
told your programmatic store in both of

969
00:57:06,821 --> 00:57:11,770
those combined are why we have separate
missions for caching and in return we

970
00:57:11,771 --> 00:57:15,700
could conceivably do it on one mission,
but it makes more sense to do it in two.

971
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:18,471
Yeah.
So the,

972
00:57:18,471 --> 00:57:21,120
the question for those of you who
couldn't hear the question was do these,

973
00:57:21,121 --> 00:57:23,460
these two rovers that are
participating in sample return,

974
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:27,940
do they have a mission after they've
completed their through sampling, um,

975
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:32,160
responsibilities and the answer certainly
in the case of 2020 and the answer is

976
00:57:32,161 --> 00:57:35,400
an emphatic yes. Um, it
as I, as I said before,

977
00:57:35,401 --> 00:57:39,540
it has an instrument package that's
doing in such science in addition to the,

978
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:43,560
to the sampling operation that Institchu
science can happen before your collect

979
00:57:43,561 --> 00:57:47,900
samples, while you're collecting samples,
after you collect samples and as a,

980
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,550
after I just told this story that we're
afraid of the rovers aren't going to

981
00:57:50,551 --> 00:57:51,384
last very long.

982
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:56,540
The reality is they do in practice the
last for a long time and we anticipate

983
00:57:56,551 --> 00:57:59,130
after we finished that
sample caching mission,

984
00:57:59,131 --> 00:58:02,040
if the rover is still going strong,
we would continue the science mission.

985
00:58:02,610 --> 00:58:06,780
The one that's a little bit more sort
of not clear at this point is the fetch

986
00:58:06,781 --> 00:58:08,750
rover and as I showed you on that,

987
00:58:08,751 --> 00:58:12,240
that one image that showed the Mab launch
where we had a small fish rover that

988
00:58:12,241 --> 00:58:16,110
could stand off from the Mab launch
and observe it from a safe distance.

989
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:17,880
That one we expect that the,

990
00:58:17,910 --> 00:58:21,450
hopefully the rover would survive that
Bab launch and go on to do more science.

991
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:25,500
The mobile math where you're carrying
the map on your back and you and you put

992
00:58:25,501 --> 00:58:27,780
it into his launch
orientation and off it goes,

993
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:31,890
that one probably trashes the rover and
we been thinking about ways to maybe,

994
00:58:31,891 --> 00:58:34,920
you know, put the, the, the, the
rocket off the back of the rover.

995
00:58:34,921 --> 00:58:38,730
So it's not thrusting directly
down onto it, but, but that, that,

996
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:41,370
that fetching mission also the,
the,

997
00:58:41,570 --> 00:58:44,970
the amount of science instrumentation
that we would be able to put on that

998
00:58:44,971 --> 00:58:47,340
system, which is already doing
the Malveaux and everything,

999
00:58:47,610 --> 00:58:50,850
it's a much more questionable thing.
So I think 2020 is going to,

1000
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:54,270
it's going to do a good ancillary science
mission air regardless of the sampling

1001
00:58:54,271 --> 00:58:56,820
operation.
The ability of the Fetch rover to,

1002
00:58:56,821 --> 00:58:59,700
to continue to do more
science is questionable.

1003
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:03,360
So that's playing into the
architecture of the missions.

1004
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:06,230
Okay.
So Brian wants to know,

1005
00:59:06,290 --> 00:59:09,860
how are you planning to get the necessary
amount of maneuvering capability to

1006
00:59:09,861 --> 00:59:13,580
rendezvous with the OSTP given that
the vehicle uses an eye on drive.

1007
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:18,550
Great.
Five for five,

1008
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:22,880
what? Ask me like why Mars is
red or something like that.

1009
00:59:22,881 --> 00:59:27,590
Please send me a softball and I
could smash out of the field. Now,

1010
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:28,440
um,
we'll,

1011
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:32,200
we'll actually augment that ion thrusting
system with a cold gas thrusters

1012
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:35,900
system specifically for the purpose
of doing the, the rendezvous function.

1013
00:59:35,901 --> 00:59:40,010
And we could not execute the rendezvous
purely with the low thrust engines that

1014
00:59:40,011 --> 00:59:43,100
you have when you're doing ion thrusting.
So it'll be cold gas,

1015
00:59:43,101 --> 00:59:47,270
either hydrazine or maybe even xenon.
That was the pressure and it was,

1016
00:59:47,271 --> 00:59:50,000
was the gas that we're blowing
out of the ion thruster,

1017
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:54,170
we might be able to use some
spare a xenon for that function.

1018
00:59:54,171 --> 00:59:57,510
It turns out in practice,
hydrazine has a much more packs,

1019
00:59:57,511 --> 00:59:59,000
so much more powerful punch.

1020
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:01,820
And so it's better for us to
use hydrazine as the fluid,

1021
01:00:01,821 --> 01:00:04,310
but we will not try to do
it with the ion engines.

1022
01:00:04,311 --> 01:00:07,910
We do the rendezvous with a cold
gas or, or, or hydrazine system.

1023
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:13,700
Is there any consideration to
have more than one sample return?

1024
01:00:15,370 --> 01:00:18,210
The returning vertical,
for example,

1025
01:00:18,211 --> 01:00:21,980
collecting more samples opportunistically.
And two,

1026
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:26,640
we were able to collect more than send
another mission liking next five years.

1027
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:28,320
Right.
So the question was,

1028
01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:32,490
is there a perhaps a motivation to have
multiple sample returns either from the

1029
01:00:32,491 --> 01:00:33,660
sample set?
Um,

1030
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:36,270
I'm gonna extend a little bit on your
question either from the samples that we

1031
01:00:36,271 --> 01:00:38,190
take from 2020,
um,

1032
01:00:38,191 --> 01:00:42,480
or multiple sample return
missions themselves on the
answer. The answer is yes.

1033
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:44,430
Uh,
we were going to carry,

1034
01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:47,850
right now the plane is security a little
more than 40 of these sample tubes and

1035
01:00:47,851 --> 01:00:51,570
we'll collect as many as we can. We'll lay
as many on the surface as, as possible.

1036
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:56,250
My guess is that none of them
are going to be such duds that,

1037
01:00:56,280 --> 01:01:00,000
that we would want not want
to bring them back. Right. Um,

1038
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:03,660
there's going to be a fantastic
scientific debate on whether we bring back

1039
01:01:03,661 --> 01:01:07,350
sample two, four, six, nine,

1040
01:01:07,410 --> 01:01:10,320
etc. Which ones we bring back.
But we're,

1041
01:01:10,321 --> 01:01:14,280
we're most likely not going to be able
to bring back every single tube that we,

1042
01:01:14,310 --> 01:01:15,450
that we collect.
So there,

1043
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:19,680
there would be a strong motivation to
want to return all of those tubes. Um,

1044
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:21,750
furthermore,

1045
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:25,530
we're only going to be able to land at
one site and do science and that one

1046
01:01:25,531 --> 01:01:26,364
location.

1047
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:30,270
And while we're trying to pick landing
sites that have a diversity of potential,

1048
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:35,340
um, scientific return, it
is only one place. And then
just like on earth, you know,

1049
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:35,990
you can,

1050
01:01:35,990 --> 01:01:40,200
it's not the same thing to vacation in
Hawaii as it is to vacation in Finland.

1051
01:01:40,590 --> 01:01:41,401
And so we would,

1052
01:01:41,401 --> 01:01:45,960
we would want to go to other places on
Mars and return samples from multiple

1053
01:01:45,961 --> 01:01:49,290
locations that of course a required
different mission to do the sample

1054
01:01:49,291 --> 01:01:51,870
collection of caching.
Also, as you can tell from,

1055
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:53,520
from what I've described to you so far,

1056
01:01:53,790 --> 01:01:58,020
we're making are rather large
investment in the technology for this.

1057
01:01:58,021 --> 01:02:01,500
And it would be great to see it amortized
over multiple missions rather than

1058
01:02:01,501 --> 01:02:04,930
just one singular one. So we can, we,

1059
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:08,790
we can envision multiple sample
return missions either to finish,

1060
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:11,640
kind of finished the job if there's
still good samples left from the first

1061
01:02:12,330 --> 01:02:16,590
mission or to have multiple sample returns
flown from different landing sites,

1062
01:02:16,591 --> 01:02:17,880
different samples,
suites.

1063
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:19,040
So,

1064
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:24,040
so now that we have pretty strong evidence
that there was a historical flowing

1065
01:02:24,351 --> 01:02:27,300
liquid water on Mars,
um,

1066
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:31,030
would that have potentially impacted,
uh,

1067
01:02:31,070 --> 01:02:33,830
kind of the coloration or the planet
such that they're red planet was not

1068
01:02:33,831 --> 01:02:34,664
historically?
Right.

1069
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:41,800
That's a,
that's a hard question as a easy question.

1070
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:49,350
So I'm not kidding. You've stumped
me more with that question then.

1071
01:02:49,351 --> 01:02:52,510
With all the previous ones
that have come, uh, you know,

1072
01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:57,000
the red plants red because it's iron
oxide in the soil. That's why it's red.

1073
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:02,840
The presence of liquid water didn't really
affect the fact that desire and oxide

1074
01:03:03,181 --> 01:03:05,580
exists on Mars. I think that,
that, that's not necessarily,

1075
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:08,910
the water's not necessary
for that iron oxide to form,

1076
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:12,490
so that the connection between
color and presence of water, um,

1077
01:03:12,570 --> 01:03:15,360
I may have a scientific colleague
who's going to make my phone buzz in a,

1078
01:03:15,370 --> 01:03:18,030
in a as 80. Oh, no,
you're wrong. Um, but I,

1079
01:03:18,031 --> 01:03:21,320
I think that those are relatively
disconnected phenomena.

1080
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:24,190
Thank you again.
