1
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,760
Well, good afternoon everyone.
My name is Vint cerf.

2
00:00:08,761 --> 00:00:10,800
I'm your chief Internet evangelist.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,490
And that wasn't the title I
asked where I wanted arch Duke,

4
00:00:14,491 --> 00:00:15,324
but he didn't work out.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:21,030
We're here to talk about operation smile
and you don't want to hear that from me.

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,670
You want to hear that from the guy
that's going to actually make it happen.

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,240
And so I wanted to introduce Ruben Allah
to give you an idea of what this is all

8
00:00:29,431 --> 00:00:33,390
about. And I've stolen, uh, his bio here,

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,170
so I need comes from Google, right?
So that means it must be correct. Um,

10
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,980
and I don't want to read the whole thing
cause he's going to tell us a little

11
00:00:43,981 --> 00:00:46,320
bit about how he got involved
in this in the first place.

12
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,090
That's a story all by itself,

13
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,010
but he's a physician and he's a
public health specialist from Panama,

14
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,460
but he spent 25 years
with Operation Smile,

15
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:02,060
which tells you something about how
dedicated he has been to the project.

16
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,100
And by the time he's done with his talk
today, I think you'll understand why,

17
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:12,870
uh, he actually got involved when
he was still an undergraduate.

18
00:01:12,871 --> 00:01:17,130
If I remember correctly, you were a
translator for the program is from Panama.

19
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,290
So he was helping the people who didn't
happen to speak Spanish, presumably, uh,

20
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,360
to, uh, execute on their,
on their project. Uh,

21
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,330
he's got all kinds of experience
with lots of organizations, uh,

22
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,050
dealing with health care
all around the world. And I,

23
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,260
I don't want to spend too much time,
frankly,

24
00:01:37,261 --> 00:01:41,430
Ruben on your biography because what's
important is not what you've done but

25
00:01:41,431 --> 00:01:46,150
what you're doing. And that's what
I want people to hear about. So, uh,

26
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,320
let's get room in up here to tell us
the story of operation smile and his

27
00:01:51,661 --> 00:01:53,870
involvement in it.
So Ruben [inaudible]

28
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,410
the stage is yours.

29
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,363
Yeah,

30
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,010
good afternoon everybody.

31
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:10,660
It's really great to be here with you
today and we appreciate the time that

32
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:14,650
you've taken to actually come join us
and to those of you who are connected as

33
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:17,350
well, hopefully you'll enjoy this
story of hope and transformation.

34
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,500
I am speaking with Vince
before coming to join you.

35
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:24,130
He talks about the tire
that you all have as a,

36
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:28,270
as an organization to share knowledge,
allow people to learn,

37
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:32,590
allow people to collaborate and the
ability to get the knowledge to actually

38
00:04:32,591 --> 00:04:35,740
create solutions to complex,
very, very complex problems.

39
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,250
And if we actually do do that every day,
if we actually do,

40
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:43,690
do solve problems that actually can
help the lives of people, uh, then,

41
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,830
then we have something, right. Um,
so my colleague and friend Chris,

42
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:50,080
Brian and I are here to
talk about operation smile.

43
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,120
And as you see in that you've seen
in the video, in the picture, um,

44
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:57,400
we take her children were born with a
facial deformity called cleft lip and

45
00:04:57,401 --> 00:05:01,420
cleft palate. Uh, and this
kits, um, you know, are,

46
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,270
are coming to the world in
many different countries.

47
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,090
You actually have the ability to go
to take care of them in so many other

48
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:07,900
countries,

49
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,870
the treatment that they saw required
is not necessarily readily available,

50
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,220
but we can solve that problem.

51
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:18,690
So operation smile started back in 1982
and the Philippines and Dr. McGee and

52
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:21,830
his wife Cathy Mcgee went to
the Philippines. And I say,

53
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:26,440
I drove around the pool area,
say realize the amount of need.

54
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:31,240
But they're very quickly went into a
very nice hotel and they started driving

55
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:33,170
through, through, through the countryside.

56
00:05:33,171 --> 00:05:36,010
And so the beautiful landscapes
and the beautiful children,

57
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:41,260
but nothing could have ever prepared him
to see what they saw in the small town

58
00:05:41,261 --> 00:05:45,940
of Naga CT where they were supposed to
operate on about 50 children who were

59
00:05:45,941 --> 00:05:47,440
born with cleft lips and palates.

60
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:52,060
300 of them came and their families.

61
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,640
So as they made their way
through the masters of people,

62
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,110
they could send some society,

63
00:05:56,111 --> 00:06:01,111
the despair and they did take care
of those 50 children at that time.

64
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,470
And there were no plans of going back.

65
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,340
A woman came to Dr. McGee and
his wife and said, you know,

66
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,200
I have his basket of bananas that I like
to give you to say thank you for trying.

67
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,430
Thank you for trying.
Her kid had no received surgery,

68
00:06:16,431 --> 00:06:20,330
but just the fact that
someone had actually tried
was meaningful enough for her

69
00:06:20,331 --> 00:06:23,630
to probably give one of
the few things you had. Uh,

70
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,940
the director of the hospital
at that time said, you know,

71
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,410
if you ever get a chance to come back,

72
00:06:27,411 --> 00:06:30,320
please come back because
these kids will still be here.

73
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:34,310
There might be five or 10 years
older. Um, but they'll still be here.

74
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,330
So they went back to the United States
live we can do to came back to live their

75
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,880
lives as usual, but they couldn't
stop thinking about these kids.

76
00:06:40,881 --> 00:06:45,020
So they gather a whole bunch of friends
and went back in time and time again.

77
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:48,440
And that's how operation smile started.
And as they say in life,

78
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,170
there are no ordinary moments.
This was an extraordinary,

79
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:55,160
extraordinary moment that set in motion
a chain and a sequence of events that

80
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:59,390
has allowed many people like
you to actually be engaged
in this transformation.

81
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,060
We was talking about the fact that I was
born in Panama and up to the age of 16,

82
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,050
this is what I had seen of Panama.
This is a beautiful city,

83
00:07:09,051 --> 00:07:12,260
the amazing beaches. If you ever
get a chance to visit, please visit.

84
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:16,440
I guarantee you'll enjoy
it. But beyond that, um, I,

85
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,190
I didn't really know they
need so my own country.

86
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:22,430
So when Operation Smart came in 1992,
this is what I saw,

87
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:27,770
hundreds of people again coming to Ho
to operation smile at the hospital.

88
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:32,420
And at that point I met
bill and Cathy Mcgee,

89
00:07:32,421 --> 00:07:36,950
which was amazing. But I started asking
myself, what have these kids been?

90
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,800
Why haven't I never seen one of them?

91
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,640
And I started to learn about
the people, Panama, my con,

92
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:49,020
the country where is worn through
little Bartolo and his sister c,

93
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:54,980
but 12 was about two years old when his
sister was about eight years old and she

94
00:07:54,981 --> 00:07:58,790
had traveled for five hours to get to
the place where operation smile was.

95
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:03,230
She had nothing but a couple of
changes, some diapers, a bottle,

96
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,580
a little pocket change,

97
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:09,940
and the normal responsibility of bending
her baby brother back with surgery and

98
00:08:10,071 --> 00:08:13,760
hopefully a new lease in life.
Think about it, eight years old,

99
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:18,590
how many eight year old children that
you know, where that responsibility

100
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:24,350
so, but was sick, what operation
smile treated him. And he was,

101
00:08:24,351 --> 00:08:26,810
by the end of the last day of surgery,
he was,

102
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:32,140
he was healthy enough for surgery and the
tears of his little sister as she held

103
00:08:32,151 --> 00:08:37,151
him in the recovery room sort of
become this emotional symbol of what

104
00:08:39,081 --> 00:08:43,130
transformation can be for people like
care for children like her. But they were,

105
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:47,030
they became the conduit for me to start
to learn about the needs of people in my

106
00:08:47,031 --> 00:08:47,864
country.

107
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:53,030
And on the other side I saw hundreds of
volunteers coming together to actually

108
00:08:53,031 --> 00:08:56,940
help them. So they will have a place
to sleep. So they have to food to eat.

109
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:01,470
So they have transportation in addition
to surgery. Uh, they could go back home,

110
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,820
um, knowing that they had been
truly cared for being careful.

111
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,920
This is the team that actually came to
Panama in 1992 and if you see there's a

112
00:09:08,921 --> 00:09:11,880
brand dot and their side,
that's me at 16,

113
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:16,680
translating and learning.
When I go back to Panama,

114
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:20,970
I go back with a great sense of joy
because what I see now is my country mates

115
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,850
doing the work by themselves.
You see,

116
00:09:23,851 --> 00:09:28,620
that group didn't just come to caretaker
children. They came to set an example.

117
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,330
They came to share the knowledge.

118
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:33,870
They came to use that knowledge to
create a change, to take action,

119
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,310
to solve a problem,

120
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:39,450
and that's spread like wildfire
and the people in my country,

121
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,930
and that's the sense of the
reasons of joy and pride.

122
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:46,410
Now when you see the pictures of
children with cleft lips and this,

123
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:50,400
this gap in the, in the, in the
mouth, you might think, well,

124
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,040
if you fix it for me, that's it, right?

125
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:58,320
This kids actually have to have
had to endure bullying, making fun.

126
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:02,130
We'd be made fun of being
ostracized so we can change that,

127
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:07,020
but it's much more than appearances is
much more than than than what you see.

128
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,140
These kids actually have
a lot of problems eating.

129
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,780
So imagine it's not just
the opening of the lid,

130
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:14,790
but I saw also in the opening
of the roof of your mouth,

131
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,000
whenever you go into a swimming pool and
you drink water and it goes through the

132
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:22,520
nose, it's very painful because there's
this openness, an open openness in,

133
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:23,730
in the roof of the mouth.

134
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,910
That's what these kids feel every
single time they try to feed.

135
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:31,200
So imagine you having a baby and trying
to feed this baby and the painful

136
00:10:31,201 --> 00:10:35,340
experience that this baby has to go
through. So when we fix the deformity,

137
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,840
we enabled the baby to be
nourished properly, to feed
properly, to grow properly,

138
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,340
and to fight disease properly.

139
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:47,690
Imagine the moment among
holds her child and gifts. Uh,

140
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:52,110
I'm breastfeeds that moment is restored
and the beauty that goes along with it.

141
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:53,670
In addition to that,

142
00:10:53,671 --> 00:10:58,671
because of that openness there is that
that whole children have a difficult time

143
00:10:59,161 --> 00:11:00,440
speaking.
Um,

144
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:05,360
so when we actually do surgery
on them and we closed that,

145
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:05,880
that,

146
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,970
that it's not only about closing the hole
but actually putting the muscles where

147
00:11:08,971 --> 00:11:10,380
there's the muscles are supposed to be.

148
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,280
Children are able to speak properly again
and then they're able to go to school.

149
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,820
They will to communicate with
their peers every three minutes,

150
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,580
somewhere in the world.
A child is being born this way,

151
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:25,680
but we have solution.
We can actually erase this formally.

152
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,210
We can actually take
care of these children.

153
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,570
There are many diseases in the world
that today we don't have a solution for.

154
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:31,890
We can correct this.

155
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:37,190
It just takes the ability to dream and
action to actually follow through and

156
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:39,090
create and turn that dream into a reality.

157
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:43,350
So we do believe that no child should
have to suffer from lack of access to safe

158
00:11:43,351 --> 00:11:46,350
surgery.
But it isn't only about children.

159
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:51,300
And as you go through the chilled to two
through different towns and countries,

160
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,200
you understand the level of need.

161
00:11:53,201 --> 00:11:58,201
And back in 1998 much younger
back then I met Rosa Maria Rosa.

162
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:04,480
Maria was a 73 year old woman and she
had lived her entire life with this

163
00:12:04,481 --> 00:12:08,530
deformity and I couldn't help myself.
I had to ask her, but somebody, yeah,

164
00:12:08,531 --> 00:12:11,020
for 73 years you have lived this way.

165
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:16,540
What made you finally get surgery
to what she promptly answered.

166
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,220
I didn't know I could get care.

167
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:23,470
I had no idea that it could get surgery
and these could be fixed and then she

168
00:12:23,471 --> 00:12:28,471
said my entire life I have hoped to be
like any other woman to make me feel

169
00:12:30,191 --> 00:12:31,240
pretty.
For an instance,

170
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:36,750
maybe even wear lipstick now too to the
females in this room and so many of us

171
00:12:38,021 --> 00:12:41,080
when I think, well lipstick of all
things, but think about it for a second.

172
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,590
You get up in the morning,
you do your head hair,

173
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:47,050
you do your makeup and you
don't think about it twice.

174
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:52,710
This movement had dream about them
moment for 73 years I do news.

175
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,030
She got surgery and by the time she left,

176
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:58,870
all the female volunteers and
doctors and nurses had given her,

177
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,970
given her all the cosmetics
that you have brought,

178
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,920
probably likely enough
to last her lifetime.

179
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:08,080
So operation smile continues to try
to go to every corner of the earth.

180
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:11,350
And we've operated on boats,
we've operated on planes,

181
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,350
we have operator classrooms.
This is actually a project that we have.

182
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:18,730
We actually have to respond and we are
able to respond to some of the victims in

183
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:21,360
Haiti outside of the cliffs.
We've operated on tents.

184
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:25,930
We were looking to operate on mobile units
and frogs creating seven environments.

185
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:30,540
But we've also created infrastructure
that that allows kids to receive the very,

186
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,590
very best,
no matter where they are,

187
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:37,150
hospitals and centers that that
offered nothing but excellence, uh,

188
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:40,620
to these kids because we believe
that they all need save. Well,

189
00:13:40,621 --> 00:13:42,640
Tom and effective surgery.
Now,

190
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,460
how many of you have had surgery
and raise your, your hands? Cool.

191
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,580
So the vast majority of you have
that surgery, believe it or not,

192
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:52,510
by the time you're 14,

193
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:56,260
15 about two thirds of you would have
needed some type of intervention.

194
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:59,410
And if that's the case, but you live in
a country where you don't have access,

195
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,260
what's the answer to
the rest of your future?

196
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:06,970
You might actually have to live
with disability or simply die.

197
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:12,310
Billions of people today
still are knocking the access
to safe surgery and the

198
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:17,311
poorest third of the world actually have
a very small amount of access to care

199
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:22,000
available. This is a problem we can
solve this problem we should solve.

200
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:27,970
And this is where you come in because
using your gifts is what enables people to

201
00:14:27,971 --> 00:14:29,870
actually start making wave and,

202
00:14:29,871 --> 00:14:33,780
and solving complex problems
like the ones we discussed. Um,

203
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:39,570
you have the ability to actually take
someone from the shadows and give that

204
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:44,180
person the ability to live a normal,
happy, fulfilling life. And He's,

205
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,140
when you actually make a change in
someone's life is not that person.

206
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:50,920
Is that family, is that
community? Certainly the,

207
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,593
to me,

208
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:58,940
someone like doing Alex who story I'll
tell you represents sort of the best in

209
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:03,200
humanity and the people who are impacted
by what you might do or what your,

210
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:08,260
what you do and in turn take that energy
and continue the chain of positive

211
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:13,220
actions. So here's he's, he's holding
his little kid and this is don't Alix.

212
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:14,960
And as I asked them, Alex, no, Alex,

213
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,550
what do you feel when you realized
that your child had been born this way?

214
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,400
And as he tells me the experience,

215
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:27,380
this is many years after he starts
to cry and he says, I was hopeless.

216
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,680
I was ready to sell my little house on
and the little car that I had inherited

217
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:37,160
because I knew I had to go
for care for a to my child.

218
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,780
He didn't have to because of volunteers
and members of operation, smile team,

219
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:46,790
he's baby kid. Boy was able
to get surgery. What, what's
remarkable about them,

220
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:50,150
Alex, is that he realized that he wasn't
the only one who was in that situation.

221
00:15:50,151 --> 00:15:54,380
So he started going around his
region of Alachua in Honduras,

222
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,050
making sure that any child
who was born this way,

223
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,870
we'll make his or her
way to operation smile.

224
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,000
And these are some of the families that
through him having able to make it to

225
00:16:05,001 --> 00:16:06,770
operations from Honduras to get care.

226
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:12,790
So every action that is positive and
makes a change in the lives of people

227
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:19,040
creates actually an avalanche
of really positive things.

228
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:24,500
And because of that is that I,
I tell you today, we need you.

229
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:28,400
It's the reason we need you
because we can dream bigger.

230
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:33,490
What if through all the
different tools and,

231
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,750
and opportunities that you
create with your knowledge,

232
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,470
we were able to not only my powder,
how fireline show is,

233
00:16:39,471 --> 00:16:43,410
but where all the children that
he's found and the children who, um,

234
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:48,040
we need to make sure I continue to get
care and they once were being born, who,

235
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:52,460
who might not be able to understand how
far they had to get to and how can we

236
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:55,640
make sure that we use that knowledge to
offer assistance so that they can make

237
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:58,670
it to a place where they
can get the care they need.

238
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:04,270
What if we use the tools at our disposal
to make sure that not a single mom has

239
00:17:05,361 --> 00:17:09,110
to software because she doesn't know
that her child can actually get care.

240
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:15,760
Today there about 7 million people who
made 7 million healthcare workers in the

241
00:17:17,481 --> 00:17:20,000
world. We're still required to
take care of the needs of people,

242
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,890
so we have to train more providers.

243
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,460
What if we're able to use the tools
are this puzzle to make sure that the

244
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:29,180
knowledge is readily available
so that more people engage,

245
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:33,380
some more people create so
that more people share so
that more people give their

246
00:17:33,381 --> 00:17:34,650
talents to,

247
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:39,170
to actually create this opportunity
to give someone a chance,

248
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:43,370
um, and do so in the most, normally
the most more knowledgeable,

249
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:46,100
knowledgeable ways,
but the humane ways.

250
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:50,460
What if we were able to look at how the,

251
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,320
the supplies and equipment,

252
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:56,970
our source I sharing and putting the
right places in a way that's efficient so

253
00:17:56,971 --> 00:18:00,810
that not a single operating room where
children are being transformed will ever

254
00:18:00,811 --> 00:18:04,050
lack any piece of equipment.
Now here's another one.

255
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,600
Today we have the ability to operate in
this kids. But if you were to ask me,

256
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:13,350
do we know what the best technique is,
I will have to tell you no.

257
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,520
And what happens is many surgeons will
tell you the best technique to take care

258
00:18:17,521 --> 00:18:20,520
of his kids is the technique that
the surgeon is most comfortable with.

259
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:24,120
I don't know about you, but that doesn't
make me feel very warm and fuzzy.

260
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,970
I mean you don't go to and have
cardiac surgery and say, you know,

261
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,650
I don't know what
technique is the best one,

262
00:18:28,651 --> 00:18:31,200
but I'll use my own and see how he goes.

263
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:36,890
But because we have the ability to
look at the before and the after,

264
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:42,890
what if we were able to use modeling
to understand how symmetry and soap

265
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,760
happening and matched that they're
really good outcomes to the,

266
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:51,660
to the techniques and now we're not
talking about a manual process of those

267
00:18:51,661 --> 00:18:52,351
kinds of surgeries.

268
00:18:52,351 --> 00:18:55,650
We could actually be taking the knowledge
of thousands of surgeries operations,

269
00:18:55,651 --> 00:19:00,390
operation smart has Oprah in over
300,000 children and would not knowledge.

270
00:19:00,391 --> 00:19:03,720
We could actually come back to the
surgeons or anybody who wants to learn to

271
00:19:03,721 --> 00:19:07,020
actually take care of this case and says
this is the way to take care of them.

272
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,270
This is the one that's going
to give them the best result.

273
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:12,450
This is the one that's going to give
a chance to kids. So actually smile.

274
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:15,900
You may or may not know,

275
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,790
but we believe that change
starts with the young people.

276
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:25,840
And because we believe that we
have to take action for those and,

277
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,230
and decades and hundreds of years to come,

278
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,520
we have to empower the young people
to start a movement or to grow their

279
00:19:32,521 --> 00:19:36,180
movement. Operation Smile
has very proudly, um,

280
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,520
join forces for decades now with,

281
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:42,210
with high school students now with middle
school students or university students,

282
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:47,970
they might not be doctors and nurses,
but they have no ulterior motives.

283
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,160
If they say,
I want to help a kid,

284
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:54,810
what they say so much more pristine and
beautiful and genuine that anything am I

285
00:19:54,811 --> 00:19:55,980
able to be able to say.

286
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:00,750
So if they are telling us it's change
starts with me and we give them a platform

287
00:20:00,751 --> 00:20:04,830
to advocate, to make those changes,
to, to spread the message, to educate,

288
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,120
to engage,

289
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,100
to actually say everyone can smile and
to actually empower them to continue to

290
00:20:11,101 --> 00:20:15,630
say, we won't stop until we heal.
I think we're on to something.

291
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:20,310
I think we're on to something.
Last but not least today,

292
00:20:20,311 --> 00:20:23,700
we have the ability to correct the
deformity. But I have to tell you,

293
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:27,300
we don't have the ability to avoid
it from happening, ultimately.

294
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:31,620
Like to be out of a job. We'd like
to be able to say, we have to stop.

295
00:20:31,621 --> 00:20:33,600
We can stop this from
happening all together.

296
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:38,820
So how about the ability to generate
that knowledge, to investigate,

297
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:43,570
to research and to come up with
the, with the ways to avoid, um,

298
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:47,710
a child from having to be born
into this world with this,

299
00:20:47,711 --> 00:20:49,660
with this disease where this 4 million,
so

300
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:54,310
we know that if in the, in,
in a, in some parts of Asia,

301
00:20:54,311 --> 00:20:57,430
one in every 500 children is one this way.
We know that in the United States,

302
00:20:57,431 --> 00:20:59,350
one of every thousand children,
there's one this way.

303
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:03,490
So it's interesting if you take someone
from Asia, from that population in Asia,

304
00:21:03,491 --> 00:21:06,340
and they moved to the United
States a couple generations later,

305
00:21:06,341 --> 00:21:10,930
if they haven't mixed, the incidence goes
from one in 500 to one in a thousand.

306
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:14,650
So we know that there's something in
the genetics that's interacting with the

307
00:21:14,651 --> 00:21:18,790
environment that's triggering
the deformity, that's,

308
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,870
that's creating this thing from half ever.
And,

309
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,660
but if we are able to avoid it
from happening altogether, um,

310
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:29,110
that will be something truly
celebrate in a nutshell.

311
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,290
Whenever we see a kid in
an empty operating room,

312
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,080
in some remote region of the world,
we know today,

313
00:21:35,081 --> 00:21:39,280
we can actually feel that with
supplies and teams and people who are

314
00:21:39,281 --> 00:21:42,220
knowledgeable, who are kindhearted,
who actually want to make a change.

315
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,540
But for that to happen,
many more people have to actually engage.

316
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,410
So when you actually decide to
join us to actually support us,

317
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:54,730
whether it's with resources or time or,
or your talents and your knowledge,

318
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:56,140
you become the heroes.

319
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,970
It might be true that in that operating
room there's a doctor, a nurse, a, an a,

320
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,850
an an a scrub nurse and Nsse ologist.

321
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:07,510
But you are truly the ones for
enabling that bridges moment to happen.

322
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,110
I'll stop with this. Um, the
story a couple of years ago,

323
00:22:11,111 --> 00:22:14,290
I was empire way and I met Carlos and
one of the recovery room and other

324
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:19,291
recovery roommates see Carlos with his
baby rock and his baby and singing to her

325
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,630
and rocking her and singing
to her so much love.

326
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,540
And as I'm filling out the medical record,

327
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:28,810
I couldn't help but be
moved by the moment.

328
00:22:28,811 --> 00:22:32,230
And I asked the nurse if she knew
anything about it and he said, well,

329
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,110
mom sort of left them because she
couldn't deal with the fact that the baby

330
00:22:35,111 --> 00:22:36,310
would have been more with a deformity.

331
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:41,410
So He's been raising this child by
himself. I walked to Carlos and I said,

332
00:22:41,411 --> 00:22:44,260
you know, I hope you won't mind
me saying this, but I've seen you.

333
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:49,160
I've seen the way you love your kid.
And if at some point I get a,

334
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:53,470
I get to be fortunate enough to be a
dad and I'm fortunate enough to love my

335
00:22:53,471 --> 00:22:58,360
child half as much as yours, as you love
yours, I will consider myself a very,

336
00:22:58,361 --> 00:22:59,380
very fortunate man.

337
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:04,790
So a few months ago I
gave a welcome to my, my,

338
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,490
my little baby girl,
Amelia.

339
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:10,390
But the reason I show you will do this
picture is not only because of the joy

340
00:23:10,391 --> 00:23:11,290
that she brings to me,

341
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,910
but because of that memory of that
commitment to be a good father,

342
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:19,780
to be a loving father,
to be a loving member of our communities.

343
00:23:19,781 --> 00:23:24,160
And societies have to
actually do something about
the ones for less fortunate

344
00:23:24,161 --> 00:23:28,000
than I am.
So on behalf of every single operation,

345
00:23:28,001 --> 00:23:31,420
smile member in the world who
would spend every ounce of energy,

346
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:36,690
who will see beauty in every single one
of his children who would actually share

347
00:23:37,121 --> 00:23:40,630
with you the excitement that we feel
every time we bring a kid out of the

348
00:23:40,631 --> 00:23:44,980
operating room and give it back
to mom, to you, the thinkers,

349
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,550
the innovators,
the dreamers.

350
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:50,180
We asked you to join us and we
give thanks for everything you do.

351
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,693
Okay.

352
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,860
I think I'm going to
stand here and cry for it.

353
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:09,710
We're going to do a little Q and a and I
already have a couple of questions that

354
00:24:09,961 --> 00:24:11,770
I want to,
you have to stand up.

355
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,820
This is the way we treat our guests here.
Yeah,

356
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:23,220
there you go. So, um, well
I don't know about you,

357
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:28,950
but every, every time I hear this story,
you know, it really, it's very touching.

358
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:34,700
But you began at the very end to tell
us a little bit about what causes this

359
00:24:35,881 --> 00:24:39,600
condition. And the answer is we actually
don't know. Is that right? Yeah.

360
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:42,050
Well, when many, many diseases,

361
00:24:42,051 --> 00:24:45,830
you can actually identify the
disease to a specific chromosome,

362
00:24:45,831 --> 00:24:48,800
even to a specific gene with clapping.

363
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,000
We have many different genes that
are involved and we're still actually

364
00:24:53,001 --> 00:24:57,080
discovering some potential genes
that have some influence over, over,

365
00:24:57,081 --> 00:24:59,840
over the creation of this is a 4
million. Now this, this happens,

366
00:24:59,841 --> 00:25:01,760
if you think about it,
this is me,

367
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:06,540
happens anywhere from the four to 12 a
week of gestation. So when, when the, the,

368
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:10,220
the mom's side of the earliest,
uh, uh, parts of pregnancy,

369
00:25:10,221 --> 00:25:11,600
anything that my impact,

370
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:17,100
that beautiful process of sales coming
together and an organ we informed, uh,

371
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:21,210
could potentially impact, um, the process
in itself and end up in a, in a club.

372
00:25:21,211 --> 00:25:24,500
So we're still trying to figure
out not only all the genes,

373
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:29,060
but also the interactions between
those genes and the environment.

374
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:32,070
So is there evidence that it's
genetic, you know, there's,

375
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,650
are their families for example,

376
00:25:33,651 --> 00:25:38,651
that have a higher percentage of children
born with this condition and other

377
00:25:38,811 --> 00:25:42,400
families do? Correct? Correct. So
you do, you make a practice of, uh,

378
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:44,030
by the way you guys have questions,

379
00:25:44,031 --> 00:25:47,000
you should be thinking about them and
their microphones on either side of the

380
00:25:47,001 --> 00:25:50,810
room so that you should take
advantage of that. Um, is it,

381
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:53,210
are you taking DNA samples,
for example,

382
00:25:53,211 --> 00:25:56,840
from errands in children and
accumulating that overtime?

383
00:25:57,310 --> 00:26:02,310
It seems to me are kinds of
neural networks are pattern
matching algorithms and

384
00:26:02,851 --> 00:26:07,840
other kinds of big data analysis might
allow us to find correlations, um,

385
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:13,360
between the genetic information and the
children that we discovered with this

386
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:15,310
condition.

387
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,240
Certainly.
Um,

388
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:20,500
a few years ago we actually
started collecting DNA samples.

389
00:26:20,501 --> 00:26:23,980
Now it's a lot easier because
the samples now or just swaps or,

390
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:27,790
or saliva we take, so it's not
intrusive to, to children and families.

391
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,980
But we understood that by
explaining to them the,

392
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:34,660
the opportunity that they were given
us to maybe stop this from happening

393
00:26:34,661 --> 00:26:35,870
altogether, that we would, we,

394
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:39,310
we felt that we could have their support
and we have got an overwhelming support

395
00:26:39,311 --> 00:26:43,150
from the family. So we actually have the
largest repository of DNA information,

396
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,350
um, and different
populations in the world. Um,

397
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:50,700
we've started to study it and we continue
collecting the samples because we

398
00:26:50,701 --> 00:26:52,670
believe that,
um,

399
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:57,270
when we're able to actually
finally target specific areas and,

400
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,430
and the environment,
the relationship with gene environment,

401
00:26:59,431 --> 00:27:00,960
we'll be able to start
solving this problem.

402
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:06,140
You mentioned that you see different
incidences of this condition in different

403
00:27:06,721 --> 00:27:08,620
parts of the world.
Um,

404
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:13,740
so that suggests that you mentioned
the environmental conditions,

405
00:27:13,741 --> 00:27:18,741
which might include viruses or bacteria
as well as genetics might have a role to

406
00:27:20,401 --> 00:27:21,234
play.

407
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:26,630
It seems to me we have a companies and
even know which are called Calico and

408
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:29,160
California Life Company.
It's trying,

409
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:32,550
it notices that people get old and it's
trying to figure out how to stop that.

410
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:37,980
And I'm interested in that
for obvious reasons. Uh,

411
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:41,100
unfortunately the engineers
misinterpreted that.

412
00:27:41,101 --> 00:27:44,130
It's sort of like that's the fastest
way to make sure nobody gets old.

413
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,700
That's not the solution is the
problem that we're looking for. Uh,

414
00:27:47,701 --> 00:27:52,020
but they're trying to look for
genetic evidence from centenarians.

415
00:27:52,021 --> 00:27:55,140
What is it about the people who
live to a hundred years or more?

416
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:57,630
What is it about their
genetics than mine correlate?

417
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,130
So I just wonder if the tools that they're
using might conceivably be applicable

418
00:28:02,131 --> 00:28:03,180
to this problem.

419
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:07,760
First of all, I was really interested in
that product as well. Uh, but absolutely,

420
00:28:07,761 --> 00:28:09,310
yes.
You know,

421
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:14,710
the same process of understanding how
we are impacted by what's around us.

422
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:20,140
Um, and the richness of information that
we have within ourselves or impact that

423
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:22,820
it's can be replicated in
that way. So, you know,

424
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:27,730
now when we know today that nutrition
plays a role, we know that potential, uh,

425
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,770
medications play a role. We
know that alcohol, tobacco,

426
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:34,420
some drugs might play a role, but how do
you explain that to a mom who's never,

427
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:38,640
well, you can't, but,
but think about Zika,

428
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:43,200
which had such a dramatic effect
on children and microcephaly.

429
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:48,120
We were able to discover that
correlation very, very quickly.

430
00:28:48,121 --> 00:28:50,340
But I think it was
because it was in Brazil,

431
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:54,180
the first incident is starting to
show up and it was extremely intense.

432
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:57,810
Large numbers, written relative terms
were happening all at the same time.

433
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:01,950
And so the correlation was
established there. Here we have, uh,

434
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:07,040
what I guess is a more diffuse effect
and much harder to food discovery.

435
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:12,300
Um, if you have questions, you should
use the microphones and if you don't,

436
00:29:12,301 --> 00:29:14,640
I'm going to keep going.
Uh,

437
00:29:14,641 --> 00:29:19,641
so how long does it take to train a
surgeon to perform this procedure?

438
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,830
And the implication of,

439
00:29:22,831 --> 00:29:26,820
one of the things you said is it is not
exactly the same procedure every time.

440
00:29:26,821 --> 00:29:31,410
It depends on the nature of the deformity,
how you choose to resolve it.

441
00:29:31,411 --> 00:29:35,990
So this sounds like it's not a
simple, uh, training program. What,

442
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,620
how long and how hard is that?

443
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:42,340
So I'm going to say the procedure of
taking of a child with a cleft lip,

444
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:45,820
it's a shortest, 45 minutes.
In 45 minutes or less,

445
00:29:45,821 --> 00:29:48,940
you can actually transform
the life of a kid. And,

446
00:29:48,941 --> 00:29:53,410
and the pilot surgery takes about an
hour to an hour and a half by the the,

447
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,030
the United States for instance.

448
00:29:55,031 --> 00:29:57,370
It's certainly this would take
care of these of these um,

449
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:02,290
problem would have trained 14 years after
high school to be able to finally take

450
00:30:02,291 --> 00:30:05,770
care of this. But you know,
today many of them are saying we,

451
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:09,940
there would be ways to streamline this
training so that it's not so long so that

452
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:13,630
more people in the world have access
to the knowledge base and tools to take

453
00:30:13,631 --> 00:30:17,860
care of this, of, of, of, of this,
uh, formative and but, but again,

454
00:30:17,861 --> 00:30:18,970
he gets runs the,

455
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:21,970
it gets them to be a little bit more
complex because there's such where ID and

456
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,870
in techniques, but going back, what
if we actually had the best technique?

457
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:27,610
Why did we were able to categorically say,

458
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:31,060
if you do this card here and this
Martin here and this flap here,

459
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,250
you will have a really
good result for the kids.

460
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:35,260
Then you can shorten
that amount of training.

461
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:39,140
Well, there certainly are a lot of,
I'm not an expert in surgery. You are.

462
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:44,030
But my impression is that there are
surgical protocols that are fairly well

463
00:30:44,031 --> 00:30:45,980
defined for certain kinds of conditions.

464
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:50,960
And so maybe there's a triage here where
there are a set of situations that are

465
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:55,220
solved fairly readily and obviously
with a particular procedure.

466
00:30:55,221 --> 00:30:56,840
And then the others that
are more complicated.

467
00:30:57,170 --> 00:31:00,090
We have classroom night over there.
You want to say who you are and then,

468
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:04,900
yeah, sure. Eli Is Pinto here. I'm
a cloud. See you in New York. Um,

469
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:07,870
you kind of already touched a little
bit and when I was going to go around

470
00:31:07,871 --> 00:31:09,430
training,
but here's a question to you.

471
00:31:09,431 --> 00:31:13,420
So what do you think is the
biggest challenge right now? Is it,

472
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:18,500
is it finding the people? Is it
the logistics of getting the, uh,

473
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,080
or quality stuff down to those locations?
Is it money?

474
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:26,980
Is it just training? And then the,
that's the segue from the last question.

475
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:31,600
What do you think is the biggest
thing preventing the next big push?

476
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,880
The next big, big plateau.
Does that make sense?

477
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:36,890
Yes, absolutely. I realize that's
a great question. First of all,

478
00:31:36,891 --> 00:31:41,120
I gotta say thank you for being at the
top in the front of the other room. Um,

479
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:44,750
so it's, it's really all, all
of them, all of the above.

480
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:48,380
So we have the ability to actually
put some resources into the problem.

481
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:51,200
But do we have, how are we putting
enough resources into them?

482
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,810
But if you look at that as
trying to solve the supply may,

483
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:57,860
let's say I put more doctors,
we created more hospitals,

484
00:31:58,010 --> 00:31:59,630
we put together more operating rooms.

485
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:04,490
That still doesn't solve the
problem itself because our children,

486
00:32:04,491 --> 00:32:08,510
their families have all these barriers
before they even get it get to us.

487
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:12,380
So we put a great team to offer care
in a very, very remote location.

488
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:16,100
And sometimes they still have to
travel 10 12 hours to even get to us.

489
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:20,510
And that 10 to 12 hour trajectory means
that they have to invest whatever little

490
00:32:20,511 --> 00:32:21,350
money they might have.

491
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:24,650
Some of them even borrow from
the village to even get to us.

492
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:29,090
So more so some of the, the barriers are
related to money. So much geographical,

493
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:33,170
someone or just knowledge, you know,
people aren't saying if you go,

494
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:36,200
something bad will happen to you or
you shouldn't go because you've been,

495
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:39,870
this is, this is your punishment
for something you did, Eh,

496
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,150
or your family has done.

497
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:46,280
So there's this belief in some places
that that's life and there's no solution

498
00:32:46,281 --> 00:32:49,520
for it and you have to live
through your punishment. So, um,

499
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:55,330
I guess what I'm saying is there's not
a simple solution. There's not a, uh,

500
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:59,990
one, one thing I do will fix
this problem, um, today. Um,

501
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:03,710
but we do have to start looking at how
we train people better so they're more

502
00:33:03,711 --> 00:33:04,440
out there.
How,

503
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,240
how we are in more equitable and the
things that we do so that we don't forget

504
00:33:08,241 --> 00:33:11,490
about the poorest or the most
marginalized or are they more of the mass,

505
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,810
the ones who most remote.
Um,

506
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:17,990
it isn't only about the doctors and the
nurses and the hospital is about truly

507
00:33:17,991 --> 00:33:21,050
understanding the people who are
suffering from this deformity and all the

508
00:33:21,051 --> 00:33:23,720
things that are stopping
them from getting to us. Um,

509
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:28,620
but I think there's an amazing opportunity
again with, with uh, a group of, of,

510
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:32,750
of individuals and really smart and
innovative as you to actually figure out

511
00:33:32,751 --> 00:33:36,380
some of the solutions.
It matters a great deal to them.

512
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:40,520
And if I happen to believe that
if we are fair, if we're honest,

513
00:33:40,521 --> 00:33:45,521
and then then we'll actually be able to
make a change in their lives and in turn

514
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:49,910
they will impact our lives in a
positive way as well. You can ask her

515
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:51,720
if I may.
Um,

516
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:56,430
so if I heard you correctly
then the biggest challenge
to reach in the next spot,

517
00:33:56,431 --> 00:33:59,780
so really happens way before
they even show up. Right.

518
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,150
And I'm trying to think of
ways that Google can help,

519
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,780
whether it is empowering the government
and in spreading out that information,

520
00:34:05,781 --> 00:34:07,760
and it sounds to me,
correct me if I'm wrong,

521
00:34:07,761 --> 00:34:12,100
were comedies is that challenge of with
the ramp of up to the person showing him

522
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:16,460
that solving that set of
problems is, is, is what,

523
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,630
that's one that's, that's important.
And that's maybe why I showed that map.

524
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,790
Because a lot of places in the world,

525
00:34:21,791 --> 00:34:24,610
a lot of countries do not even
know this is a significant problem.

526
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:29,260
There's not a registry. So
until we go there and you
say, luck, we like to do this,

527
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:33,130
they don't realize that hundreds of kids
or our people are having to deal with

528
00:34:33,131 --> 00:34:33,964
this.
And all of a sudden,

529
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:37,000
what if we were able to actually mad
the areas where this kids are so we can

530
00:34:37,001 --> 00:34:39,370
actually do follow up if we
know that they're really far,

531
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:43,350
how do we help them get to us?
Um, if we, if we understand from,

532
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,450
from the ones who come to us or
they're having other issues in terms of

533
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:51,280
knowledge and beliefs, how do
we address those as well? Um,

534
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:52,360
but you know,
it'll,

535
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:56,200
it'll take something that enormous amount
of resources and talent and commitment

536
00:34:56,201 --> 00:34:59,950
to actually make it happen, but
we can make it happen. So yes,

537
00:34:59,951 --> 00:35:00,910
we have a question over here.

538
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,410
Thank you for coming. Talk to you. But

539
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:08,970
from my personal experience is not mine,
but my cousins,

540
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:14,300
my cousin is younger to me
and he just married yesterday.

541
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:20,170
Yeah. Yesterday. And he had a cleft, um,

542
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:25,460
from the very beginning when I believe
they did try the surgery when he was

543
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:31,890
seven or eight years old. That was
the first shot he faces a little bit.

544
00:35:31,891 --> 00:35:35,310
But then he went again. Um, I never,

545
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:39,120
I mean I will definitely understandably
naive. I always had an excuse.

546
00:35:39,121 --> 00:35:39,990
I was the younger one,

547
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:45,050
but I think that the entire family didn't
really know what was going on because

548
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,840
of the grades and the school performance
and nobody knew that everybody thought

549
00:35:48,841 --> 00:35:53,190
they existed. How the brain
is just list. Um, and um,

550
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:55,590
but now he's married,
he's an engineer,

551
00:35:55,860 --> 00:36:00,630
but it took him a lot of it for it to
get where he was a and multiple surgeries

552
00:36:00,631 --> 00:36:03,150
and I guess there was a
couple of decades ago,

553
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:08,310
so I'm sure things have advanced a bit,
but what are the success scenario?

554
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:11,490
This is when they looked at
that I thought like, wow,

555
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,060
that's amazing that I haven't
seen in practice. Um, in my,

556
00:36:15,061 --> 00:36:20,040
in others like looking at my
whatever sample set I have seen, um,

557
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:24,910
and that was also in India. So where there
could be a, not at the top of the line,

558
00:36:24,911 --> 00:36:28,110
surgical a surgery procedures,

559
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:31,610
I have to keep her in that
area as much as here. Um,

560
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:34,920
my main channel is more like how would,

561
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:39,720
if you wouldn't know there wasn't Google
there then either like I could just

562
00:36:39,721 --> 00:36:44,040
Google it and put the picture in
search. Hey, what is this? So,

563
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,253
um,

564
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:50,010
how would things have been
different if he would be 20 years

565
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,900
younger and we were born now

566
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,610
that's a great question.
First of all, congratulations.

567
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,870
That's amazing that he just got
married and that's exactly the, the,

568
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:08,050
the type of story you want to tell because
kids were born this way should have

569
00:37:09,201 --> 00:37:13,430
the opportunity to live a full and
happy life. So that's fantastic. But um,

570
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:16,880
I imagine that you're talking about
a couple that gets out, go in India,

571
00:37:16,881 --> 00:37:17,441
that your family,

572
00:37:17,441 --> 00:37:21,440
we actually have to go through
the hardship of having to
figure out how to offer

573
00:37:21,441 --> 00:37:24,770
a care. Now, you mentioned he
was operated at the age of six,

574
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:28,310
but if I were to tell you that today,
operation smile operates,

575
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:32,420
takes care of these kids from three months
on a ball above in the United States

576
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:36,020
in a few weeks after birth,
the kids are being taken care of.

577
00:37:36,021 --> 00:37:37,820
So we do three to six months,

578
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:41,810
started the surgical process out of
maintaining a level of safety courses,

579
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:44,930
obviously surgery. So we want to
make sure the kid is strong enough,

580
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:49,670
but the younger you take care of them,
the, the, the skying is probably least,

581
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,850
least likely to actually be noticed.
Um,

582
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:57,800
in an ideal scenario, this is the outcome
that you want. You know, a child who,

583
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:02,400
who looks beautiful and you can barely
tell. Um, but sometimes it'd be as,

584
00:38:02,401 --> 00:38:05,330
as soon as the surgery,
the outcome might not be the best one.

585
00:38:05,331 --> 00:38:08,330
So maybe a little short. So you have
to go on and read through the surgery.

586
00:38:08,331 --> 00:38:11,690
And that's again why it's so important
to understand what the surgeons that are

587
00:38:11,691 --> 00:38:15,900
getting these beautiful outcomes and
learn from those surgeons consistently and

588
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,600
throughout now.

589
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:23,590
So the rate of success to actually be
able to take care of a kid 45 minutes,

590
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:28,840
it's doable. The Red of success,
uh, in the hands of experts is,

591
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,620
is really, really very high. And that's
why it's so important to train. Um,

592
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:37,810
but your story is one of hope because
he was able to grow even through the

593
00:38:37,811 --> 00:38:42,550
hardship of getting a treatment later.
But you post a question, what if,

594
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:44,680
uh,
he had been born today,

595
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:50,490
it would have been easy to find out a
little bit or get a picture and find out

596
00:38:50,621 --> 00:38:54,010
where he could go to
actually receive a treatment.

597
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:57,640
That would have been really nice. Right?
So information, it gives you choices,

598
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:00,730
but what about places in the world?
But there's still no information.

599
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:04,560
There are places in the world would,
you still don't have access? Uh,

600
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:09,520
so hopefully at some point soon
and we'll, we'll, you know,

601
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:13,600
anywhere in the world, a family may
have access to through our mobile unit,

602
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:16,300
him and sometimes in a conscious where
you don't have a computer where you have

603
00:39:16,301 --> 00:39:18,820
a alum phone is actually pretty pervasive.

604
00:39:18,821 --> 00:39:20,380
It used to be that that wasn't the case.

605
00:39:20,381 --> 00:39:25,130
But what if every single family and in
any village in the world and in this

606
00:39:25,131 --> 00:39:30,130
small little town could actually find
out that, oh, my child was born this way,

607
00:39:30,131 --> 00:39:33,530
but I can get care. So it would be a
different story. Right? So you, you,

608
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:35,620
he wouldn't have had to
wait until six years old,

609
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,140
but today if we actually
made this possible,

610
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:42,100
then maybe children shouldn't weighed
more than a few months to actually get

611
00:39:42,101 --> 00:39:42,934
this taken care of.

612
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:46,310
So this raises a very
interesting possibility. And we,

613
00:39:46,311 --> 00:39:50,000
we've been doing work on facial modeling,
for example,

614
00:39:50,001 --> 00:39:54,560
which you alluded to in your talk,
uh, in order to try to understand,

615
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:57,890
you know, what would happen if
we perform surgery on this child?

616
00:39:57,891 --> 00:40:02,600
What might the outcome look like? That's
helpful for the family to understand.

617
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:08,140
But I can imagine having a family that
takes a photo with their mobile phone and

618
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:11,300
instead of saying,
find me more pictures like this,

619
00:40:11,301 --> 00:40:14,330
which was one of the features
that we have a, it would be,

620
00:40:14,331 --> 00:40:19,220
what can I do about this? Um, you
know, show me places that, uh, that,

621
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:23,240
uh, can treat this, uh, visible situation.

622
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:26,660
Uh,
that's sounds almost doable.

623
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,900
It sounds like we could find
a way to take a picture.

624
00:40:29,901 --> 00:40:34,520
You're like that do a search. They would
turn up operation smile for example.

625
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,020
So we ought to think about it.

626
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:38,890
Yeah. And he goes back to their
license. Original question,

627
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:41,010
what else can we do with that?
We have the ability to do

628
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,000
the, um, the other thing,

629
00:40:43,001 --> 00:40:48,001
the point about people getting
online were only 50% penetrated,

630
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:49,990
uh,
globally.

631
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:54,370
So when I was talking to Eric Schmidt the
other day informed me I wasn't allowed

632
00:40:54,371 --> 00:40:56,680
to retire cause we're only 50% done.

633
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,810
I have another 3.5 billion
people to get online. So,

634
00:41:01,811 --> 00:41:05,890
so much for any, any retirement
plans. [inaudible] um,

635
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:08,190
I'm wondering,
uh,

636
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:13,230
about the facilities that you
need in order to do the surgery.

637
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:16,270
I mean,
is this is,

638
00:41:16,271 --> 00:41:19,930
this isn't exactly like a field
hospital thing, but I mean, what,

639
00:41:19,931 --> 00:41:24,460
what kinds of conditions are adequate in
order to do this, this sort of surgery?

640
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,780
That's a good question because again,

641
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:29,690
when you take a kid from the
arms of a mom and her dad,

642
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:33,320
you want to make sure that you
give that kid back. It's a huge,

643
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:36,610
almost sacred
responsibility. You will. Um,

644
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:40,290
so where can you take care of his kids
in a way that is safe and Alfresco?

645
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:44,630
High Quality Operation Smart has been
able to perfect a model through standards

646
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:49,100
that were created with experts from around
the world to make sure that the right

647
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:52,980
anesthesia machines, the right,
um, uh, oxygen supply, the rive,

648
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:57,140
anesthetic gases, et Cetera,
et cetera are available.

649
00:41:57,141 --> 00:42:01,510
So we can actually go to a
very remote hospital. And, um,

650
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:03,380
she was asked where they'll burn room,

651
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:08,530
there are lights on the oxygen and we
bring actually everything else that that's

652
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:12,560
required for that kid to get that very,
very safe surgery at that time.

653
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:14,540
And we're very proud of that.
But,

654
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:19,010
but we're wanting to do is go beyond that.
I mean,

655
00:42:19,011 --> 00:42:21,110
it shouldn't be an episodic
thing or even in this,

656
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:24,620
and we have centers that are download
centers that work year round.

657
00:42:24,621 --> 00:42:28,940
But if I go to a very remote town and I,
and I leave,

658
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:32,000
am I taking care of x
amount of kids? But, um,

659
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,980
but I have to figure out a way to
continue to help that town. Um,

660
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:38,150
so our cofounder almost
say, oh, it says, you know,

661
00:42:38,151 --> 00:42:42,470
kids with cleft lips and palates actually
give us a chance to learn through them

662
00:42:42,471 --> 00:42:44,420
about the needs of their communities.
Um,

663
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:47,840
so we've started to actually get more
engaged in, in areas related to safe,

664
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:52,190
the safety of surgery, so that a lot
of places that are very remote, um,

665
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:55,910
I start to be an access to the
proper anesthesia machines,

666
00:42:55,911 --> 00:42:59,060
instruments a supply so
that not only their kids,

667
00:42:59,061 --> 00:43:00,980
but the family members
can actually get surgery.

668
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:04,610
And if we do do help this
system of health of a country,

669
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:06,620
then it's less likely that they need,

670
00:43:06,621 --> 00:43:10,450
will be so overwhelming and then we can
actually work together with either of

671
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:14,400
those governments or the community.
You know, a lot of people put the,

672
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:18,410
the responsibility on governments
and so you have to take care of this.

673
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:22,550
But health, which is a
right, it's a responsibility,

674
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:25,010
responsibility that all of us share.
Um,

675
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:29,390
so everybody in the community can actually
do something to create units like the

676
00:43:29,391 --> 00:43:31,420
ones that we create, um, in,

677
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:35,360
in more remote areas and to make
them be there for the long haul.

678
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:38,600
What happens post up,
I mean,

679
00:43:38,601 --> 00:43:41,030
you worry about things like
infection and everything else.

680
00:43:41,031 --> 00:43:46,031
So how long do you need to
keep the children in the
hospital or somewhere where

681
00:43:46,701 --> 00:43:51,020
you can be, you know, avoid disease
and infections and things like that.

682
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:52,460
So he's actually quite simple.

683
00:43:52,461 --> 00:43:54,260
When you take care of a kid
with a cleft lip and palate,

684
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:57,380
they can actually go home by the
next day. That's amazing. Um,

685
00:43:57,730 --> 00:44:00,160
I mean obviously we have to make sure
that there's proper coverage and the

686
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:03,650
antibiotics, they have proper
medications, but we actually, um,

687
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:08,030
see them at the very least three to seven
days after surgery to make sure that

688
00:44:08,031 --> 00:44:12,020
everything is okay. But you pose a
question that is a big parcel for us.

689
00:44:12,021 --> 00:44:15,020
So we want to see their kids six
months later, three months later,

690
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:19,940
nine months later. But, um, if the
kid has traveled 12 hours on a boat,

691
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:23,150
on a donkey,
on a horse or whatever,

692
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,610
how do you make sure that you're
able to see that kid again?

693
00:44:25,611 --> 00:44:26,690
And you're at ease that the,

694
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:31,230
let's hope that the mobile phones and
the camera's [inaudible] sort of remote

695
00:44:31,231 --> 00:44:32,310
diagnosis,
remote

696
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:34,420
health care, uh, has this

697
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:37,570
Marlo the plane there Coreg
bill and today what we do it,

698
00:44:37,571 --> 00:44:40,360
we still send teams out to actually
make sure that the kids are great,

699
00:44:40,361 --> 00:44:45,361
but every single one of these
actions requires time and resources.

700
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:50,530
If we are able to use tools that enables
to be more efficient and still offer

701
00:44:50,531 --> 00:44:51,820
really high quality care,

702
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:55,450
then we can actually reinvest
those resources in to
taking care of more and more

703
00:44:55,451 --> 00:44:56,980
kids and train more and more people,

704
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:57,400
you know,

705
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:02,110
would almost imagine that
you've seen these photographs.

706
00:45:02,111 --> 00:45:03,010
It's dramatic.

707
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:07,330
You would think that because of
the dramatic positive outcome,

708
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:12,790
this would stimulate interest in
creating the hospital facilities in those

709
00:45:12,791 --> 00:45:13,780
remote villages.

710
00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:18,220
Having seen what medicine can do in
this point and very dramatic case.

711
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:23,200
And so that might, uh, might stimulate
provision of better health care.

712
00:45:23,201 --> 00:45:28,090
And it's certainly a message to deliver
to countries that are struggling with

713
00:45:28,091 --> 00:45:32,860
the health of their
population. Um, let me just,

714
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:37,270
uh, round this up unless there are
other questions from others here.

715
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:41,060
Um, and ask you once again, um,

716
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:47,110
to tell us a little bit more about the
opportunities that we have as individuals

717
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:52,111
and maybe as a corporation to contribute
to operation smile and its success.

718
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:57,340
You mentioned quite a long list
of things that that could be done.

719
00:45:57,341 --> 00:46:02,200
Is there a place on the website that
says here are the things that we need

720
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:07,590
people to do or to contribute or to take
action about? Would we find out on the

721
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:13,050
website? And the website is mainly
an awareness and opportunity tool.

722
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:13,460
Uh,

723
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:16,950
and that allows people to get educated
and understanding this is a problem that

724
00:46:16,951 --> 00:46:20,130
can be fixed and allows us to have garlic,
gather the resources.

725
00:46:20,131 --> 00:46:23,300
But this goes back to again, the same
question and how to, is asking. It's like,

726
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:28,010
how can we help? Which is a beautiful
question to us. Certainly resources. Um,

727
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:31,340
uh, and Google is very, very
generous when, when, um,

728
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:34,730
employees or staff or team
members give a of their,

729
00:46:34,731 --> 00:46:38,280
the resources who will match it.
It's, and that's one way to give, but,

730
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,640
but there's more ways to engage.
And if you think about it,

731
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:44,250
and I mentioned this in an operating
room, you have a doctor, a nurse,

732
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:47,130
and an anesthesiologist
before that moment happens,

733
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:50,970
a lot of people have had to actually
make a decision that that problem is a

734
00:46:50,971 --> 00:46:53,940
problem. Uh, our cofounders,
you shall assess, you know,

735
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:58,540
love is a decision to make someone
else's problem your problem. Um,

736
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:02,900
so when we look at normally
given resources, what do
you have time it's, is, is,

737
00:47:02,901 --> 00:47:06,080
is important. So there are ways
of volunteering. Um, you know,

738
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:09,660
we not only have doctors and
nurses who actually help us,

739
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:12,800
we have many nonmedical medical
volunteers who, who's doing,

740
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:16,470
if somebody from Google volunteer, what
would, what would we, what would happen?

741
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:20,130
They couldn't help us with
medical records. They could
help us manage, um, the,

742
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:23,940
the environment where kids or
families feel very comfortable, uh,

743
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:25,800
interact with them.
Listen,

744
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:29,770
we have the ability to not only offer
care but actually transform a hospital

745
00:47:29,771 --> 00:47:32,800
that might be like a very,
very dark place and to a place of hope.

746
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:35,550
And that it's not something
the doctors usually doing.

747
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:39,090
So when we see a kid that comes in on
an operating room and they just grabbed

748
00:47:39,091 --> 00:47:41,440
our hands and follow us,
we know that many volunteers,

749
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:46,050
I've actually made that kid and the
parents feel welcome, feel care for.

750
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,730
I feel appreciate it with dignity.

751
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:52,150
And that's what a lot of our non medical
volunteers are able to do with us.

752
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:53,261
And listen,

753
00:47:53,261 --> 00:47:58,060
certainly outline at a serious of
potential opportunities for solutions to

754
00:47:58,061 --> 00:48:02,410
problems that are complex in
the way we look at them today.

755
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:06,180
Because my brain doesn't work the
way you're still the US or, or,

756
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:08,320
or our friends here do put.

757
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:13,110
But I am sure that someone here
or someone connected here, um,

758
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:17,680
is already thinking about how do I make
sure that people figured this out better?

759
00:48:17,681 --> 00:48:19,750
How to make sure that we can
actually fix this problem.

760
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:21,880
How do we make sure that we actually
have avoid this from happening?

761
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,390
What knowledge do I bring us as,
as a,

762
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:29,350
as an innovator that can
tell great people, hey,

763
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:32,350
you've been doing a good job, or we can
make it better. We can do it better.

764
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:37,320
No, thank you so much Ruben, for
telling us this story. It's, uh,

765
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:42,340
it's all about human dignity and it's
restoration and that's something we could

766
00:48:42,921 --> 00:48:43,790
all we for.

767
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:48,290
So I hope that everybody who's out there
listening and maybe watching this video

768
00:48:48,291 --> 00:48:52,760
later, we'll take the opportunity, take
the opportunity to help operation smile,

769
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:55,830
create some more smiles all around
the world. Thank you so much.

770
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:00,310
