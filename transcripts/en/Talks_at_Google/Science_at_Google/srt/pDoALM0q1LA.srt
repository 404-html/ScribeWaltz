1
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:08,560
Uh,

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:13,560
I'm Jonathan Rosenberg and I ran product
management here for 10 years and I

3
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:18,450
don't usually come and introduce
speakers, but, and it's special.

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,820
And so I came to tell you why

5
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,630
since 2002 when I joined Google,

6
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:29,130
my favorite days were
Mondays for 10 years.

7
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,820
Monday morning was Eric and Larry Staff
meeting and I was surrounded by smart

8
00:00:32,821 --> 00:00:34,710
people with a mission that mattered.

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:40,320
And in the afternoon I would run my
staff meeting and my staff meeting was

10
00:00:40,321 --> 00:00:42,750
Sundar and solar and Marissa.

11
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,340
And the second smartest was Jackie's
sister. Is this being recorded?

12
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,850
Susan, I love you. And in 2011,

13
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,760
when all of that ended and I
moved out of an operational role,

14
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,910
I thought I'd never have
exciting Mondays again.

15
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,020
Then Susan introduced me to Ann and I
started going to 23 and me's staff meeting

16
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,380
and helping over there. So
now on Mondays, once again,

17
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,420
I'm surrounded by smart people and I'm
in a company where the mission that

18
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,560
we're,
the mission matters,

19
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,040
bringing personalized medicine
to like make us healthier.

20
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,690
Like we care about being healthier.
So the mission is terrific.

21
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,340
The team is brilliant.

22
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,750
It's a little bit different because more
than half of the faces in the room are

23
00:01:30,751 --> 00:01:35,020
women and the CEO is a woman
and Katie and Jessica are here.

24
00:01:35,021 --> 00:01:37,170
Some of the people who are in
the staff meeting, in fact,

25
00:01:37,171 --> 00:01:39,660
more than half of the faces in the
room are women. Even when I'm there,

26
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,880
I'm doing pretty well.

27
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,860
So rather than kind of go through
all the Yada Yada of a traditional

28
00:01:46,861 --> 00:01:48,780
introduction, you know,
like an is special.

29
00:01:48,781 --> 00:01:53,781
And she went to Yale and she spent 10
years doing like medicine and healthcare

30
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,830
investing and is very googley look at the
way she's dressed for her Google talk.

31
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:04,050
So listen to an listened to her vision,

32
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,130
listen to them talk and Jordan talk
about some of the great challenges that

33
00:02:08,131 --> 00:02:08,701
she's faced,

34
00:02:08,701 --> 00:02:12,960
building 23 and me and many of the
googly values that she's infused in this

35
00:02:12,961 --> 00:02:17,961
wonderful company and an you're the reason
I get out of bed on Monday mornings.

36
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:19,523
I love you.

37
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,480
[inaudible]

38
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,220
okay,
I'll turn things over to Anna and Jordan.

39
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:38,260
All right. Can you guys hear me
okay? Thank you for joining us here.

40
00:02:38,261 --> 00:02:42,160
Really appreciate it. And thank
you for joining us. Of course,

41
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,640
after an intro like that.
So I know he can't beat that.

42
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,820
So for the force 45,
50 minutes,

43
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,340
I'm going to go with the questions
that I took from the dory.

44
00:02:51,341 --> 00:02:53,170
So thank you all first
mandatory questions.

45
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:57,100
And then for the last 10 minutes we'll
do mixture of live questions and dory

46
00:02:57,101 --> 00:02:58,540
questions.
Um,

47
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:03,010
but I to start off first
with your relationship here
with Google and your story

48
00:03:03,011 --> 00:03:05,050
that you were telling me
about you and the cafe.

49
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:09,370
Yeah. So I honestly, I've known
Google since the very earliest days.

50
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:14,320
It started in my sister's garage.
Um, so it was one of those things in,

51
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:18,700
in the early days we'd be doing dishes
and we could see Sergei and Larry coding

52
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,490
and like the other bedroom. And I
used to always say, it was like,

53
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:25,510
it's really weird that you have these
guys like just sitting in the other room

54
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:28,960
coning while we're doing dishes.
Like it was a really unusual, um,

55
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:33,340
so obviously I've spent a lot of time at
the company and I was saying how I'm 23

56
00:03:33,341 --> 00:03:37,020
and me used to have an office,
I'm on the shore birds,

57
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:41,230
so just around the corner and we're, you
know, like we're a startup, we're scrappy.

58
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:45,520
And, um, so it was very apparent that,
you know, Google had a lot of food.

59
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:48,910
So we used to make our way over here.
And you know,

60
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:51,390
back when there was Burrito's
right downstairs, um,

61
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:54,490
there was a great burritos
and so they're easy to carry.

62
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:58,900
So I would walk over every other Thursday
and we'd have these team lunches and I

63
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,730
just get like 10 burritos.

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,740
And so I was walking out carrying like
my mom mind burritos and I opened the

65
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:09,230
door and I look, and it's Eric Schmidt
and Steve Jobs. Okay. And I was like,

66
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:14,900
oh, hi. Like, what are you
doing? And Eric's like, what
do you have to, I'm like,

67
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,530
oh, just getting lunch. And Steve had
just launched the iPhone and was like,

68
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,310
have you seen the iPhone? Do you want
to see it? I'm like, yeah, great.

69
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:27,130
So, um, so I've had a lot
of great experiences. Um,

70
00:04:27,131 --> 00:04:31,180
I'm obviously in such a huge fan of
Google and a lot of ways it's had a huge

71
00:04:31,181 --> 00:04:36,181
influence on 23 and me and I think a lot
of the values that I saw especially in

72
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:39,160
the early days have really
influenced how we run the company.

73
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,490
Now you were mentioning
about your values and 23,

74
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,930
me and you were telling
me about your role,

75
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:48,540
your relationship with your grandmother
and your experience with the healthcare

76
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,200
system. Can you talk a
little about it? Yeah, yeah.

77
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:51,700
Um,
you know,

78
00:04:51,701 --> 00:04:56,701
I think so as a background I used to
invest in healthcare companies and um,

79
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:57,971
you know,

80
00:04:57,971 --> 00:05:01,300
health is a really complicated industry
and it's not necessarily always doing

81
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,770
the right thing for the consumer.

82
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:07,830
And I used to always complain
like I actually the last fun,

83
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,960
the last Hedge Fund I was at was a
fun that we nicknamed Death Watch.

84
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,890
And we used to just short everything
cause it's really easy to predict failures

85
00:05:14,891 --> 00:05:18,130
and biotech, but it's hard to
predict successes. And so I was like,

86
00:05:18,131 --> 00:05:21,480
kind of just like this really negative,
like everything sucks in healthcare.

87
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:24,070
It's all bad. It's all failing.
It's like all about like,

88
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:25,870
how do I just take
advantage of the consumer?

89
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,300
And I remember Larry Turning
to me one day and he's like,

90
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:32,080
and you're either part of the solution
or you're part of the problem right now.

91
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:35,770
You're part of the problem. Um,
I was like, oh, like that's true.

92
00:05:35,771 --> 00:05:38,970
Like in some ways I was a good
slap of like, you have to, if you,

93
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:41,770
when you see problems you need
to do something to change it.

94
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,170
And one thing that we've always,

95
00:05:44,171 --> 00:05:47,080
my family has always been really
passionate about is healthcare.

96
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:51,880
And part of this came from the fact
that my mother, um, was, you know,

97
00:05:51,881 --> 00:05:55,180
she was very poor growing up and she
had a little brother and when he was 18

98
00:05:55,181 --> 00:05:56,014
months old,

99
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:00,200
he got into a bottle of aspirin and he
ate that bottle of aspirin and he was

100
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:03,050
clearly lethargic. They took them
from hospital, a hospital hospital,

101
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:05,350
and my mom was five at the time. And, um,

102
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,910
they were refused treatment because
they couldn't show proof of payment.

103
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:12,140
They finally got some hospital
to take him and they took him.

104
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:14,240
And then when my grandmother
called in the morning,

105
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:19,520
they said he was dead and it had a huge
impact on my mom as it would have on any

106
00:06:19,521 --> 00:06:23,090
family. And my mom at this time
was like, you know, very clear.

107
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,200
If you don't take care of yourself,

108
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:27,860
no one will and you have to be
responsible for your healthcare.

109
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:32,110
So when I pulled my Kaiser
medical records at some point, um,

110
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,190
my sisters and I discovered
that our records actually
had an asterisk at the top

111
00:06:37,191 --> 00:06:40,220
that said,
as all of us in pediatrics know,

112
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:44,810
this mother can be very irrational at
times. And as Jonathan has had some,

113
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,490
some lovely times also working
with my mom, my mom is a force.

114
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:53,960
Um, and especially in health care, like
we routinely get fired from doctors.

115
00:06:53,961 --> 00:06:56,330
We routinely or told people
don't want to work with us.

116
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:59,990
And I think it's one thing I've learned
is like in some ways good healthcare

117
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,440
comes to those who complain and
you have to be really proactive.

118
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,950
So it was one of those things like we
were always a super proactive family, um,

119
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,360
you know,
understanding our health.

120
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,720
And it was one of the things that I
think really bothered me when I was

121
00:07:11,721 --> 00:07:16,130
investing in healthcare is I realized how
much the system is not set up for your

122
00:07:16,131 --> 00:07:19,770
success. Like no one
makes money if you, um,

123
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:24,650
if you live to be a hundred and you never
are sick, no one makes money, you know,

124
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:26,690
and healthcare is 18% of our GDP.

125
00:07:26,691 --> 00:07:29,780
Like clearly lots of people are
making money off you being sick,

126
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,250
but as a real problem.

127
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,020
And so a lot of my passion for 23 and
me when I started the company came from

128
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:40,730
how much I said like I
want to do something that's
genuinely right that allows

129
00:07:40,731 --> 00:07:44,450
people to be active in their health and
proactive the way my mother has always

130
00:07:44,451 --> 00:07:48,170
been proactive for me and that she's
taught me to be proactive with my health.

131
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,560
Can you talk about the first
years of you building 23 me,

132
00:07:51,561 --> 00:07:56,340
the challenges you went
through. So we got lucky. Um,

133
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:56,661
you know,

134
00:07:56,661 --> 00:07:59,420
I think a lot of founders
like in something like
Sergei and Larry used to say

135
00:07:59,421 --> 00:08:02,570
this, like they got lucky, they
have the right place right time. Um,

136
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,650
I happened to be,
when I was investing in on Wall Street,

137
00:08:06,651 --> 00:08:09,380
I happened to realize
like genetic information.

138
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,030
It was suddenly cheap to get access to
a broad amount of information on your

139
00:08:14,031 --> 00:08:17,240
genome. And um, you know,

140
00:08:17,241 --> 00:08:20,740
I was really lucky noticing like one
you could get suddenly individuals could

141
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:25,250
access to your genome and then there was
this whole convergence of like web 2.0

142
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,640
like there's going to be social networks
and you're going to find each other.

143
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:32,950
And it was like hot. It was so
interesting and it was my space and um,

144
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,080
and it suddenly realized,
um,

145
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,390
one of the things that's a big issue in
healthcare is there's a lack of data.

146
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:44,020
So I like routinely my sister other sister
does nutrition research and routinely

147
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:47,660
you look at those studies and it's
like 200 patients here, 200 here.

148
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:51,590
And My dad who's a particle physicist
would be like anyone who knows about

149
00:08:51,591 --> 00:08:53,730
statistics. So it was like you
can't find anything in that.

150
00:08:53,731 --> 00:08:55,130
It's like you need lots of data.

151
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:59,310
And clearly the Google world had taught
me like the value of like lots of data

152
00:08:59,311 --> 00:09:00,810
and what you can do.
Um,

153
00:09:00,811 --> 00:09:05,070
so I got lucky sort of with this
idea of why do I need Stanford?

154
00:09:05,071 --> 00:09:07,350
Why do I need Pfizer to go
and do all this research?

155
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:11,450
I can just allow all these people to learn
about their genome. Like it's so cool.

156
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,510
Learn about your genetics.

157
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,960
And then we're going to bring everyone
together in this whole new research model

158
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:19,170
is going to be like crowd sourcing.
We're going to have the world's data.

159
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,690
I don't need Stanford and Pfizer
and all these other people.

160
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:24,300
I don't want you to be a human subject.
I want you to be alive,

161
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:27,090
participant excited and research.
Um,

162
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,680
so we have this idea really marrying like
this idea of cool technology with like

163
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,360
this concept of like health, you know,
web 2.0 and we launched the company.

164
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:41,310
And, um, you know, initially
I had this enthusiasm.

165
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,900
I think genetics is so cool.

166
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,320
Like I think there's nothing
cooler than the idea is like,

167
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:49,860
you have a genetic code.
Everyone in this room is 99.5% the same.

168
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,330
Yet we clearly have all this
diversity and we don't understand it.

169
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,480
Like it's like the, it's, it's
like, it's a code. Like how does it,

170
00:09:57,481 --> 00:10:01,470
how do people sleep at night? It's so
interesting and we don't understand it.

171
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:05,700
And so, um, so I have this enthusiasm, um,

172
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:09,990
but I started to realize that the rest
of the world's not quite as passionate

173
00:10:09,991 --> 00:10:14,210
about genetics as I am. Um, and so
we launched and we had, uh, you know,

174
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:18,180
we had this big spit parties,
we had all kinds of press. Um,

175
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:21,840
and then we sold probably a third,
a thousand kits the first day.

176
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:25,170
And then we were selling
like 15 to 20 kids a day.

177
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,280
And as everyone realizes
like 15 to 20 kids a day,

178
00:10:29,281 --> 00:10:32,360
if not a lot of money
like that is that is not,

179
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:36,090
not even going to be a ramen profitable
company like that is, um, that,

180
00:10:36,091 --> 00:10:38,790
that's rough. Um, so it
made me realize like,

181
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:42,570
we have to do a lot to help people
understand like what our genetics,

182
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,590
like most people, um, like really smart
people would come to me and be like, oh,

183
00:10:46,591 --> 00:10:49,200
I don't want to know my DNA. I don't
want to know the day I'm going to die.

184
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,570
And I was like, if I can tell
you the day you're going to die,

185
00:10:51,571 --> 00:10:52,800
charge you a lot more.

186
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:57,890
Like [inaudible] I was like,

187
00:10:58,021 --> 00:11:01,890
no, it's like risk, like, and you realize
like most people don't understand risk.

188
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,190
And um,

189
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:08,390
so the thing that I've been lucky with
is I have a team of people who join 23

190
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:13,200
and me because they're really passionate.
And you know, my love for science,

191
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:16,980
like I said, my father's a
particle physicist and as kids,

192
00:11:16,981 --> 00:11:20,820
my sisters and I grew up always like
realizing like we tell people like,

193
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:24,180
oh my dad is like, he studies
neutrinos, he's searching for mass.

194
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,690
And people were like, what?
Like what is he doing? And,

195
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:31,290
and I just realized like I in some ways,
like it always bothered me.

196
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,480
I think physics is the most
beautiful science out there,

197
00:11:33,481 --> 00:11:38,100
but like most people don't understand it.
And I also like in genetics is similar.

198
00:11:38,101 --> 00:11:41,940
Like I really didn't want the fate that
my father went through with physics of

199
00:11:41,941 --> 00:11:44,070
like, you know, lack of
funding and all this.

200
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:48,330
Like I wanted the average individual to
like see the beauty of the d of Dna and

201
00:11:48,331 --> 00:11:51,600
see it within their own lens
and capture this idea of like,

202
00:11:51,601 --> 00:11:53,310
we're all most interested in ourselves.

203
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:56,500
And so your DNA is really
interesting to you. Um,

204
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,960
so the people I hired in those early days,

205
00:11:58,961 --> 00:12:03,100
a lot of them are still at the company
and they're really passionate about this

206
00:12:03,101 --> 00:12:07,120
idea that like, you want people to like,
you want people to see that beauty.

207
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,930
And um, and so I'm lucky
because the fact that like,

208
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:14,140
it was hard those first years, I'm
like, we didn't have huge sales.

209
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,930
It didn't deter people
because of their, like, again,

210
00:12:16,931 --> 00:12:19,870
scientists are used to failure. Like,
wow, you know, we just have to try this.

211
00:12:19,871 --> 00:12:24,460
We have to try that. We have to like
try other strategies. So it was,

212
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,420
um, you know, I'm lucky with that.
And also the science, you know,

213
00:12:28,421 --> 00:12:32,110
one of the things that we did with the
company that was unusual is we weren't

214
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,320
excessively marketing
because we decided like,

215
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:39,130
we wanted to really make sure
that we have the science down.

216
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,700
Before we did a lot of marketing
and the one marketing thing we did,

217
00:12:42,701 --> 00:12:45,280
this is another funny story.
Um, surrogate at this time,

218
00:12:45,281 --> 00:12:49,060
I don't know who's been here for how
long Sergei was really interested in

219
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:52,180
Zeppelins blimps. Um, and so there was a,

220
00:12:52,181 --> 00:12:56,230
there was a Zeppelin for awhile and
Sergei didn't want to stick like a Google

221
00:12:56,231 --> 00:12:59,980
stickler on it. So he's like, I don't
know, he could put 23 me on it. So we put,

222
00:12:59,981 --> 00:13:01,480
cause he wanted to sell advertising on it.

223
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:06,481
So we put 23 me sticker on it and it
got a lot of press that there was like a

224
00:13:06,581 --> 00:13:10,900
giant Zeplin flying around town. Um,
like tech crunch had all these articles.

225
00:13:10,901 --> 00:13:15,550
So that was like my one attempt before
we had a marketing team. I had the blimp.

226
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,110
Um,
I'm no longer part of the marketing team,

227
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:23,350
but we really focus like as a
company to in those early days,

228
00:13:23,351 --> 00:13:25,540
we recognize like we have no business,

229
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:28,990
that we don't have a scientific foundation
and that the core of the company,

230
00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:32,500
like I needed to win over the scientists
and make sure that they understand what

231
00:13:32,501 --> 00:13:33,770
we're doing and that are a pre,

232
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:37,360
that they're supportive of what we're
doing before I go big and start going on

233
00:13:37,361 --> 00:13:38,770
TV and started advertising.

234
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:43,980
And in some ways that also
really benefited the company
because when there was

235
00:13:44,021 --> 00:13:46,990
controversy,
I never had to worry about my core.

236
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,320
Like I always knew the foundation
of the company was really strong.

237
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,250
I didn't have to worry.

238
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,710
Like I understood it was
misunderstood and all these ways,

239
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:58,180
but scientifically I was always
solid and I knew that. Excellent.

240
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,770
And we proposed a blimp idea.

241
00:13:59,771 --> 00:14:03,160
Did you have to bring it up to your
board or something? No, I think,

242
00:14:03,161 --> 00:14:04,360
I think I just did it,
you know,

243
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:07,450
that's the beauty of a startup is like
you don't even think about these things.

244
00:14:07,451 --> 00:14:09,730
I don't know, like I just,
I just put it up there. No,

245
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:12,900
I mean my board has always been,
um,

246
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:16,870
pretty small and I just
like, I, you know, again,

247
00:14:16,871 --> 00:14:19,240
when you're a 10 person company,
you're a 15 person company,

248
00:14:19,241 --> 00:14:22,570
you just like do things all the time
that are kind of crazy. Like this.

249
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:26,400
When we launched our spit party in
New York, we had Barry Diller, um,

250
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:29,860
host and like Rupert Murdoch,
like all these people host the spit party.

251
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,330
And it was on the cover of the style
section on the Sunday style section.

252
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,540
And I remember like,
see like people like Eric Lander,

253
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:39,130
like serious scientists who are like,

254
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:44,400
it is so disrespectful to have
science on like the style section,

255
00:14:44,561 --> 00:14:47,710
like this is not appropriate.
And, um, and I was like, no,

256
00:14:47,711 --> 00:14:50,950
like more people read the science sec
where more people read the style section,

257
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,030
they read science Tuesday,
like this is great.

258
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:57,620
So we were always kind of doing things,
um, that were a little bit different.

259
00:14:57,621 --> 00:15:01,700
Like we wanted to do things not to say
like the blimp, but the blimp was fun. Um,

260
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:05,030
but we wanted to do things that were
going to be atypical of what the

261
00:15:05,031 --> 00:15:07,010
traditional scientific world does.

262
00:15:07,011 --> 00:15:10,460
Cause like most people are not out
meeting New England Journal in Science

263
00:15:10,461 --> 00:15:12,890
magazine. Like we want to
bring science to the masses.

264
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,500
Excellent.
Um,

265
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:18,730
when I had been Horowitz here and we
talked about the struggle that CEOs go

266
00:15:18,731 --> 00:15:20,850
through where it's just a
really challenging time. Yeah.

267
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:23,980
And you have to really fight
through it to survive. Um,

268
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:27,430
it seemed like the struggle for you
as during that whole FDA period.

269
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:31,270
Can you talk to us about that and then
also what kept you going during that time?

270
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:35,080
You don't, I think, um, I think I've
had two struggles in the company,

271
00:15:35,081 --> 00:15:37,590
so the FDA one was clearly,
um,

272
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:41,290
an important one and it was in some ways
it was the most public and it forced us

273
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:46,150
to really change our
strategy. And um, you know,

274
00:15:46,151 --> 00:15:46,871
we got what happens,

275
00:15:46,871 --> 00:15:50,680
we got the letter and we got the FDA
warning letter on a Friday and I was at a

276
00:15:50,681 --> 00:15:53,740
team offsite where in a strategy offsite
we were like talking about like we have

277
00:15:53,741 --> 00:15:57,490
massive growth who are really excited.
We were going for a million people. Um,

278
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:02,240
and my assistant at the time texted
me and she said, you ought, um, uh,

279
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:06,670
a special, the like the, the FDA is
trying to curry or something to you.

280
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,600
And I was like, well,
don't sign for it. Um, and

281
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:15,390
I was like, I already did. I was
like, aw, why did you sign for it? Um,

282
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:20,290
and then I was like, bring it to me
and, um, and then we read it, you know,

283
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:23,020
and we were like, we'd gotten a
lot of warning letters in the past.

284
00:16:23,021 --> 00:16:25,540
Like we were kind of used to it by
that. And we're like, ah, you know,

285
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,720
whenever we got him all the time.
Um,

286
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:33,190
but this one was like a
lot more serious. Um, and,

287
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,150
and to be honest,

288
00:16:34,151 --> 00:16:38,410
like silicon valley is not known
for its interaction with regulators.

289
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:42,490
Um, so it, I was like, I think
we were relatively naive.

290
00:16:42,491 --> 00:16:43,960
Like I get this question a lot,
like,

291
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:47,080
where are we just like so arrogant and
we'd kind of given the finger to the FDA

292
00:16:47,081 --> 00:16:51,380
or where we just incompetent. And I think
it's something we were just uneducated.

293
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:55,960
Like we, um, like it took me a while
even after getting that letter,

294
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,860
cause then it was made public
on Monday morning and, um,

295
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:02,580
and people would read it and
they're like, wow, this is like,

296
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:07,420
like this is probably one of the most
serious warning letters that's ever been

297
00:17:07,421 --> 00:17:08,080
put out there.

298
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,020
And it was actually one of the former
heads of the FDA who called me and was

299
00:17:11,021 --> 00:17:15,400
like an like, they're not messing
around, like you have to stop. Um,

300
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,140
and, and it was, uh, it was,
it definitely, it halted
a lot within the company.

301
00:17:20,141 --> 00:17:24,520
And that first week I think I just spent
the entire week in my pajamas calling

302
00:17:24,521 --> 00:17:28,450
lawyers. Like I just, I didn't move
from my desk. I just called. And for me,

303
00:17:28,451 --> 00:17:31,420
I've always been very data driven.
Like I just wanted all the information.

304
00:17:31,421 --> 00:17:33,970
So it was just pulling information like,
what do I do?

305
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:38,950
And we've always historically been
really good at finding loopholes. Um,

306
00:17:38,951 --> 00:17:42,010
so for instance, in New York
where we were not allowed to sell,

307
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,060
we discovered that,
um,

308
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,660
it wasn't that you weren't allowed to
sell and you just weren't allowed to

309
00:17:46,661 --> 00:17:50,100
physically spit in the state and was like,
that's great.

310
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,940
People Been Spit in New Jersey. Um, and
so we'd found kind of this loophole,

311
00:17:53,941 --> 00:17:58,941
like customers used to have to attest
that they had not physically spat in the

312
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:04,110
state. Um, and so I spent a lot of
time figuring out like, what's the,

313
00:18:04,111 --> 00:18:07,260
like how do I work around this?
And to be honest,

314
00:18:07,261 --> 00:18:11,760
like one of the work arounds today is
that you put what we call sort of a doc in

315
00:18:11,761 --> 00:18:16,620
the box. Like you have a telemedicine
doctor where you just can call,

316
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:19,380
uh, or sorry. It's just like they
are kind of like on the backend.

317
00:18:19,381 --> 00:18:22,290
Like you not even necessarily
see it and they order it for you.

318
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:25,310
And when you have that you
can kind of circumvent,

319
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,360
you can become a
laboratory developed test.

320
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,920
And there was one regulator
in particular who, um,

321
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,060
I met with and she goes,
you know,

322
00:18:33,061 --> 00:18:36,750
and like what you're trying to do
is fundamentally really disruptive.

323
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:41,780
Like you're trying to allow consumers
to get direct access to care without

324
00:18:42,061 --> 00:18:46,110
having to go through a medical provider.
And if you succeed in that,

325
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:50,280
you can really have an impact,
a real positive impact on the system.

326
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,730
But doing that as not a
work around it's hard work.

327
00:18:53,731 --> 00:18:57,430
Like either you decide you want to put
your head down and you want to just like

328
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:02,340
really get that work done or you find
if you want to sell this company in a

329
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,070
couple of years, like you do this work
around and you're just like, whatever,

330
00:19:05,071 --> 00:19:08,730
you're just circumventing the system but,
but you can change the system.

331
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:12,210
And that conversation had a huge impact.
And I said, I said, look like, well,

332
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:14,460
I'm in it for the next, you
know, I'm in it for life,

333
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:19,410
so I'm willing to do the hard
work. And you know, it took us, um,

334
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,880
you know,
from that moment,

335
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:24,030
it was a couple of years before we
actually got our first approval.

336
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:27,300
And the way we did it, people
always ask like, what'd you do?

337
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:30,470
And in some ways when you're
in a hole like that, um,

338
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,760
no one like the regulators
did not trust us.

339
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,550
And so the way that you win back trust,

340
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:39,300
especially with an organization
like the FDA is they speak in data.

341
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:43,200
Like you guys probably all
work with people who like,
like they understand data,

342
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:47,520
like show us the data and then we
can make a decision. And so we did,

343
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:51,770
um, you know, one of the other
things I learned with the FDA to, um,

344
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,510
I always tell my kids this,
I learned obedience. Um,

345
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,030
I learned that when you go to the DMV,
you know,

346
00:19:57,031 --> 00:20:01,080
you don't argue about standing in line
or you don't argue about doing a vision

347
00:20:01,081 --> 00:20:04,110
test, you just do it. You don't try to
say like, oh, I just had one last week.

348
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:08,310
Here's the report. Um, you just
do it. And similar to the FDA,

349
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,290
you have to recognize,

350
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:13,380
they sometimes know more than you do
because they're seeing the whole picture

351
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:16,950
and you just do it. You like, you
negotiate, but you do the pro.

352
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,620
You do what they ask you to do. And, um,

353
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,610
in some ways by showing that we could be
obedient and we could follow directions

354
00:20:23,611 --> 00:20:26,970
and that we had the data to prove it.
Um,

355
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,960
and we had to change a lot of things
within the company to be a regulated

356
00:20:30,961 --> 00:20:33,250
company. And there's a lot, um,

357
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:36,930
that we had to do from an engineering
and product and design perspective to

358
00:20:36,931 --> 00:20:41,280
document how everything's happens. Um,
and so again, it's been a ton of work,

359
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:44,550
but it's fundamentally made us a much
better company because our processes are

360
00:20:44,551 --> 00:20:48,650
much stronger. Um, so it was, um,

361
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,490
it definitely was rough
and there was a lot of, um,

362
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,390
controversy within the company about
whether or not this was the right path.

363
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,180
And I think as a leader of the company,

364
00:20:58,181 --> 00:21:02,380
when the most important things is to
do is to allow controversy, you know,

365
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:05,740
allow people to have to voice their
questions. Like invoice it. Like,

366
00:21:05,741 --> 00:21:07,750
I think Google is one thing I
learned with Google. It's like,

367
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,900
you want to let people debate.
Debate is really good. Um,

368
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:14,230
but once you make a decision, everyone's
on board. And if you don't agree,

369
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:17,470
then it's not the right
place. Um, but we had,

370
00:21:17,471 --> 00:21:21,070
we have a fair amount of
debate and before, like we,
I encourage that as a leader.

371
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,210
I encourage that debate.

372
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:26,200
And then once we make a decision and you
can set a vision for the future and say,

373
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:30,400
look, like we're, we're trying to
fundamentally change the system,

374
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:33,630
would like trying to empower
consumers like my next day. Like,

375
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,340
why do you have to go and get a
doctor's order to get a blood test?

376
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:40,420
Do you always need it for
our prescription? Like
all these, like the whole,

377
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:44,440
you know, um, patriarchal system.
Like why do you actually need, like,

378
00:21:44,441 --> 00:21:48,640
why do you need this physician or medical
involvement before you can actually

379
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,570
get some of this information?

380
00:21:49,571 --> 00:21:53,500
So we're really out for
that bigger picture of like
trying to change the system.

381
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,330
So for your current offerings,

382
00:21:55,331 --> 00:21:58,330
you offer the ancestry test and
then you can get the health test

383
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,730
correct. So for two years,
we, um, we just kind of, we,

384
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,510
all we did was offer ancestry and
we focused on pulling out the health

385
00:22:05,511 --> 00:22:09,470
information we've gotten. We have three
FDA approvals now or authorizations.

386
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:12,800
So we have carrier status.
Um, we have genetic,

387
00:22:12,801 --> 00:22:16,370
which is things like cystic fibrosis.
We have genetic health risks,

388
00:22:16,371 --> 00:22:20,080
which is things like Parkinson's
disease and Alzheimer's. Um,

389
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:22,790
and then we have now the
breast cancer variance,

390
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:25,310
the three most common in Jewish women,
um,

391
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:28,610
or Jewish individuals that
we test for those variance.

392
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:29,500
Um,

393
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,990
are you playing offer more extensive
testing like such as metabolic imbalances

394
00:22:33,991 --> 00:22:38,730
and enzymes? Like what like um,
cause I have a Google or asking,

395
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:42,530
oh, it was family members
has chronic pain and I think

396
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,650
no, I mean we're focusing
on DNA. Like if it's,

397
00:22:45,651 --> 00:22:48,530
if it's a genetic variant of
a task that we could detect,

398
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,380
like we're focusing just on DNA right now.
Um,

399
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,800
so we definitely think about partnerships
that we could do that would have, um,

400
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:56,090
you know,

401
00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:00,230
especially anything that we could do
that's potentially at home where we could

402
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:03,860
allow you to have at home collection
and think about other tests that you're

403
00:23:03,861 --> 00:23:05,600
getting.
For right now it's just focused.

404
00:23:05,601 --> 00:23:08,920
Like we're definitely looking to expand
that, the tasks that we're offering. Um,

405
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:11,330
but everything will be
just based on genetics.

406
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:16,380
Excellent. Um, so given the large corpus
of data you're putting together, are you,

407
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:20,390
how have you been able to use this
like PR for promoting cures or new

408
00:23:20,391 --> 00:23:21,380
developments in the field?

409
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:22,591
We do.

410
00:23:22,591 --> 00:23:26,400
So that was part of the hypothesis of
the company is that if I collect all of

411
00:23:26,401 --> 00:23:28,260
this information and all of this data,

412
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,400
can I then more effectively
make discoveries,

413
00:23:32,401 --> 00:23:36,900
academic research discoveries as well
as can I translate this information into

414
00:23:36,901 --> 00:23:41,490
drug therapeutics? So the drug industry,
again, when I was running this,

415
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:44,880
this one I was investing in companies
and running that fund that I called Death

416
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,500
Watch.
Um,

417
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,730
part of the reason why I
could do something like
that is statistically 90% of

418
00:23:49,731 --> 00:23:53,960
everything fails in biotech.
So if 90% of everything fails,

419
00:23:53,961 --> 00:23:55,040
like you just short everything,

420
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:57,230
like there's like you don't have
to do that much math for like,

421
00:23:57,231 --> 00:24:00,680
it was just like you can
predict failures. Um, so in,

422
00:24:00,681 --> 00:24:02,180
in the drug discovery business,

423
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:06,350
it's the Pharma lobbying group is the
only group I know that like would actively

424
00:24:06,351 --> 00:24:10,430
promote every year how it's more
and more expensive to create a drug.

425
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:14,150
So like when I started investing it
with $700 million to make a drug,

426
00:24:14,151 --> 00:24:18,260
and today it's close to $3 billion.
So it's only getting worse.

427
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:23,380
So the idea with all this data is can I
in some ways more effectively use this

428
00:24:23,901 --> 00:24:24,650
data to,

429
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:28,970
to translate it into drug hypotheses
and then do I have a higher success rate

430
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,720
for making therapeutics.
So we are doing that now.

431
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,780
We hired Richard Scheller who was the
head of research and development at

432
00:24:35,781 --> 00:24:39,560
Genentech. Um, we have over 10
programs in development now.

433
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,360
We've been doing this now for three years.

434
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:46,220
We work with a ton of Pharma partnerships.
Um, so we are actively trying to say,

435
00:24:46,221 --> 00:24:50,870
can you turn data into
curative therapeutics?

436
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,620
So we are actively working on that
now. And my hope is like, again,

437
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,240
because we're a scientific team,

438
00:24:56,241 --> 00:24:59,210
like I can say this and I
have a hypothesis and I,

439
00:24:59,211 --> 00:25:00,410
but I can't make any claims yet,

440
00:25:00,411 --> 00:25:03,080
but my hope is in 10 years I can
come back and say like, look,

441
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,570
here's our success rate
compared to industry averages.

442
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:08,540
And we believe that that success rate
will come because we're starting with

443
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:10,820
something that's data
driven based on genetics,

444
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:15,860
possibly a new business model
for the users of 23 meals.

445
00:25:15,861 --> 00:25:19,190
So like if I provide you with health data,
it leads to some type of cure.

446
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:22,650
It's hard to translate.
Um,

447
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,800
the reality with drug development
is that drug development is,

448
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:31,820
um, it's a really long
and complicated process.

449
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:35,450
So at what point in time
can I identify that?

450
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:38,510
Like your participation
made such a huge difference.

451
00:25:38,511 --> 00:25:41,570
So what we tried to do is say,
like we learning from our customers.

452
00:25:41,571 --> 00:25:42,260
So for instance,

453
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:47,150
in depression we did a study where we
had 400,000 customers participate and

454
00:25:47,151 --> 00:25:50,500
thanks to the participation
of so many individuals. Um,

455
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,500
we were able to make discoveries in
depression and then you potentially can

456
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:58,310
analyze all those genetic
variants and say these are these,

457
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:01,850
this is one where we think this is
potentially a druggable target. Um,

458
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,600
so it's really hard to do the
micro attribution to say, hey,

459
00:26:05,601 --> 00:26:09,440
these individuals and plus it's
like a 10 to 15 year process.

460
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:13,370
So you might come back and
say, hey, 15 years later what,

461
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,900
what we have found is what
people really care about. Um,

462
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:19,760
like we had a community of individuals
actually have someone from Google

463
00:26:19,761 --> 00:26:23,180
actually who we worked with who had
sarcoma. She's like, I don't care.

464
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,780
What I care about is a cure.
Like I have sarcoma.

465
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:31,140
Like I have a lethal disease.
Like I would like to live. And um,

466
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,370
I find people with serious illnesses
like that. They care about two things.

467
00:26:34,371 --> 00:26:37,700
Like does this impact my children
and I would like to survive.

468
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:40,880
But me coming to you and saying,
here's a check for $100.

469
00:26:40,881 --> 00:26:44,540
I'm sorry you're going to die
soon. Like is not like it. Like,

470
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:48,690
we want to do the right thing
and everything at 23. And me, um,

471
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:52,080
all of our decisions that we make are
about what is in the best interest of our

472
00:26:52,081 --> 00:26:56,130
customers. And my customer is always
the individuals who signed up.

473
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:59,370
And so we always think about everything
from the perspective of like,

474
00:26:59,371 --> 00:27:00,630
you just participated in research.

475
00:27:00,631 --> 00:27:04,320
Like what is it that is in the best
interest for you? And if you tell me,

476
00:27:04,321 --> 00:27:09,060
for instance, that you have, you have
migraines and you have, um, you know, uh,

477
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:11,160
you know,
crones w we,

478
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:14,910
it's our job then to help you figure out
the best ways that you can participate

479
00:27:14,911 --> 00:27:17,430
in research or for us to actually
move those things forward,

480
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,230
to have some kind of impact in your life.

481
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,330
And then you could
potentially help be a control.

482
00:27:21,331 --> 00:27:23,690
There might be somebody here who's
like, oh, I'm high, you know,

483
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,430
I have a family history of prostate
cancer and we have depression.

484
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,860
And you can say, I can be
a control for you. And,

485
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:31,470
and that way everybody is
actually helping each other.

486
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:36,150
So it's hard to then point to well
who exactly is responsible because the

487
00:27:36,151 --> 00:27:37,830
reality is really a community asset.

488
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:41,770
That makes sense. Um, for the survey
aspect, when you're a member of 23 and me,

489
00:27:41,771 --> 00:27:42,880
they ask you questions.

490
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,630
Sometimes you probably might
get data that is just erroneous.

491
00:27:46,631 --> 00:27:49,240
Like do you use like multiple
data points to figure out?

492
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:53,570
We do. One of the things we found, so
this is a good example in um, we asked,

493
00:27:53,571 --> 00:27:55,850
we put out questions to our customers.
So we ask,

494
00:27:55,851 --> 00:28:00,620
we have a pretty comprehensive survey
that we first ask everyone to take. Um,

495
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,820
and sometimes you have to refine the
question. So in this day and age,

496
00:28:04,821 --> 00:28:07,430
everybody thinks they have celiac disease.
Um,

497
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:12,320
but very few people have actually
gotten a biopsy. So if I ask people,

498
00:28:12,321 --> 00:28:16,580
have you had celiac disease,
the genetic associations known,

499
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:21,200
previously known to occur with that
don't replicate. But if I ask you,

500
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:24,170
do you have celiac and have
you had a biopsy to confirm it,

501
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,800
then I can actually hit the replication.
I like get the,

502
00:28:27,801 --> 00:28:31,580
I can find in the genetic studies
the known the known findings.

503
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:36,710
So we do find that we have to triangulate
questions quite a bit. Um, again,

504
00:28:36,711 --> 00:28:39,680
it's one of the things that I learned
from Google and sort of like big data

505
00:28:39,681 --> 00:28:44,681
people is that it's much better to have
like massive amounts of dirty data.

506
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,770
And, um, for us, you know, we
have now 5 million customers,

507
00:28:48,771 --> 00:28:53,000
we have over 1.5 billion data
points on those customers. Um,

508
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:56,780
we have the potential to do a lot of
research. It's without a doubt there's,

509
00:28:56,930 --> 00:29:00,830
it's not perfect. Not
Everybody, um, um, you know,

510
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:05,450
reports everything perfectly,
but it's pretty good. And
if I ask you for instance,

511
00:29:05,451 --> 00:29:09,800
like, do you have epilepsy, you can
probably report that pretty accurately.

512
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:14,900
And so what we find is that
there's almost, um, um, you know,

513
00:29:14,901 --> 00:29:18,680
it's, it's almost a false truth that like,
oh, a clinical trial is perfect data.

514
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:22,250
It was one thing I learned when I was on
Wall Street is how much when you have a

515
00:29:22,251 --> 00:29:23,300
multicenter trial,

516
00:29:23,301 --> 00:29:27,440
if you have 20 different centers trying
to diagnose a partial response in cancer

517
00:29:27,441 --> 00:29:30,070
is really controversial. So, um,

518
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:34,160
a lot of aspects of medicine like defining
a phenotype is controversial and in

519
00:29:34,161 --> 00:29:37,520
some ways the best thing that 23
knee does is we have it all in a very

520
00:29:37,521 --> 00:29:41,440
standardized form and we always have the
ability to go back to our customers and

521
00:29:41,441 --> 00:29:43,930
ask and say, okay, if
you said you had asthma,

522
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:46,780
now we're going to go back and ask
you and ask you more about like your

523
00:29:46,781 --> 00:29:48,820
medications. You're
like, when does it occur?

524
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:51,550
And you can start to weed out
when something doesn't look real.

525
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:55,420
No, I'm sure people have
seen the information and they
might have overreacted or

526
00:29:55,421 --> 00:29:56,330
whatnot. Yeah. Um,

527
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:00,850
have you considered like any connecting
23 meter like genetic counseling or

528
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:04,450
providing people information on how to
talk about these results with the primary

529
00:30:04,451 --> 00:30:05,284
care physician? Right, right.

530
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,410
We do actually connect
people. Um, so we don't,

531
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:11,920
the main thing that we tried to do that
we feel really strongly about is that

532
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,790
health care insurance,

533
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:16,300
like a physician involvement or
genomic counselor is up to you.

534
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,470
And so we never used that as a bottleneck
for access to your information.

535
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:24,160
But if you find out, for instance,
that you're positive for breast cancer,

536
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,740
the Brca mutation,
you know,

537
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:29,530
you want to follow up with a
physician or a genetic counselor.

538
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:33,670
And so we have had partnerships in the
past and we look at doing that more and

539
00:30:33,671 --> 00:30:37,120
more as where you, we might at
least give you advice like, hey,

540
00:30:37,121 --> 00:30:41,440
here's resources where you can go to.
Um, but we don't ever, we feel, again,

541
00:30:41,441 --> 00:30:42,910
philosophically as a company,

542
00:30:42,911 --> 00:30:47,110
we feel really strongly that it's
never a bottleneck for access,

543
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:50,890
but we do provide resources for
people so they know how to follow up.

544
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,730
Um, for my friend who have
convinced to try use 23 and me,

545
00:30:55,731 --> 00:30:58,610
some of them have told me,
well, the reason why I want
to do it, it's because of,

546
00:30:58,611 --> 00:31:02,450
I know that I could be susceptible to
a heart attack or some other health

547
00:31:02,451 --> 00:31:06,440
problem. I'd rather like be
left not knowing the situation.

548
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,810
And then I've heard people who have said,
well,

549
00:31:08,811 --> 00:31:12,740
now that I know I could possibly have
a health issue and my stress me out or

550
00:31:12,741 --> 00:31:15,920
something. Have you done any research
about like the psychological aspect? Yeah,

551
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,080
we have,
um,

552
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:20,360
we have done a lot of research
and actually one of the
best studies that was out

553
00:31:20,361 --> 00:31:20,481
there,

554
00:31:20,481 --> 00:31:23,870
there was a guy named Robert Green who
is at Harvard and he did the original

555
00:31:23,871 --> 00:31:27,680
studies on Alzheimer's and looking at
people as a series of studies called

556
00:31:27,681 --> 00:31:32,210
reveal where he was able to see that
people like Alzheimer's is one of the more

557
00:31:32,211 --> 00:31:36,260
extreme. So people find out they're
genetically high risk for Alzheimer's. Um,

558
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,100
what do they do? And he found that
initially there is anxiety. Um,

559
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,680
but after three months
you returned to baseline.

560
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:46,190
And for a lot of these individuals, they
already know there's a family history.

561
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:50,600
So for instance, for people who have,
um, again, the Alzheimer's variant,

562
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,120
if there's a high genetic risk factor,

563
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:57,140
like you probably have someone in your
family network who's had Alzheimer's.

564
00:31:57,141 --> 00:32:00,410
So you know that you have some kind
of genetic risk factor already.

565
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:04,340
So what we find,
and for me the story of genetics,

566
00:32:04,341 --> 00:32:08,510
the reason why I was so interested in
genetics is that you do have genes and

567
00:32:08,511 --> 00:32:12,920
environment. So your genetics are
not, unless it's Huntington's,

568
00:32:12,921 --> 00:32:14,390
like it's not deterministic.

569
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,560
It's not 100% you have this whole
beautiful world of your environment.

570
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:23,390
And so to me, the environment
is your responsibility.
Like that's what you can do.

571
00:32:23,391 --> 00:32:27,050
Like you can do something every single
day to influence your environment.

572
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:28,640
So without a doubt there's [inaudible],

573
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:32,060
there's people who are genetically high
risk for Alzheimer's but they don't get

574
00:32:32,061 --> 00:32:33,620
it.
And so why,

575
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:37,700
like that's one thing I'm
really passionate about
personally is looking at who

576
00:32:37,701 --> 00:32:40,010
are the people who are
genetically risk for diseases,

577
00:32:40,011 --> 00:32:44,120
who never get them and what was it in
their environment. And the reality is,

578
00:32:44,121 --> 00:32:46,490
I goes back to some of the
original premise of the company.

579
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:49,550
Like one of the issues is like being
really healthy doesn't make money in the

580
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:50,360
system,

581
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:55,360
but 23 and me is really uniquely set up
in large in many ways to do research on

582
00:32:55,821 --> 00:32:59,030
prevention. So it's one of the things
we're really passionate about is like,

583
00:32:59,031 --> 00:33:02,480
look at the people who have Alzheimer's
and say, okay, is it interval training?

584
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:03,920
Is it like extreme exercise?
Like,

585
00:33:03,921 --> 00:33:08,921
what is it that really has an influence
on your life and can we then help people

586
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:13,790
take responsibility on a daily basis to
try and actually help prevent diseases?

587
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:16,880
Everyone knows or everyone gets
sick at something like every,

588
00:33:16,881 --> 00:33:18,590
like it's one of the things I always say,
people would say,

589
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:21,290
oh you're just going to have all
these healthy people. And I was like,

590
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:24,650
there's no such thing as a healthy person.
Everyone has something.

591
00:33:24,651 --> 00:33:27,830
It's like it could be depression, it
could be migraines, it could be, you know,

592
00:33:27,831 --> 00:33:30,020
stomach problems. Silly. I like anything,

593
00:33:30,021 --> 00:33:32,420
there's no such thing as
someone who like 100% healthy.

594
00:33:32,421 --> 00:33:36,490
So like for me part of it was
like helping people realize, um,

595
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,550
that like your health is really a
sum of your actions every day. Like,

596
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:44,180
and for us to be able to do that research
on like what is it in our environment

597
00:33:44,181 --> 00:33:47,830
that we can really do? And the thing
that I take most pride in is like,

598
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:50,520
rather than us creating
any kind of anxiety or,

599
00:33:50,521 --> 00:33:55,190
or other issues is what people do is like,
people are looking to, to make change.

600
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:59,030
Like people get their genetic information
and it's something in black and white

601
00:33:59,031 --> 00:34:01,790
and then they're looking to make
a change. And I think the, the,

602
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:05,300
the number one disservice
at the healthcare industry
has right now is there's

603
00:34:05,301 --> 00:34:10,301
not great support for changing your
behavior and people don't know how.

604
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:14,510
So often like we heard this, um,
with Alzheimer's, I had one doctor,

605
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:16,840
he could stood up at a conference
and complain. He goes, you know,

606
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:19,430
one of the biggest problems with 23
and me is you generate non billable

607
00:34:19,431 --> 00:34:21,650
questions and um,

608
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:24,980
and the reality is like you show up when
you say I'm genetically high risk for

609
00:34:24,981 --> 00:34:27,410
Alzheimer's and the like will come
back when you have Alzheimer's.

610
00:34:27,411 --> 00:34:30,790
Like that's what we do.
Um, but the reality,

611
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,210
like when you think about where do you
go to prevent the number one place where

612
00:34:35,211 --> 00:34:38,120
people go to prevent any kind of
disease in this country is realistically

613
00:34:38,121 --> 00:34:40,580
Walmart.
Like it's a behavior,

614
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:44,090
like the average American goes to Walmart
three times a week or in this day and

615
00:34:44,091 --> 00:34:47,540
age is going to be Amazon. Like
it's, it's, it's, you're shopping,

616
00:34:47,541 --> 00:34:50,840
it's your consumer. It's like how
you are living your life every day.

617
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:54,320
And one of the things I really try to
home in on on our customers a hammer and

618
00:34:54,321 --> 00:34:57,920
our customers is like your health is
a sum of what you do every single day.

619
00:34:58,370 --> 00:34:59,091
And so again,

620
00:34:59,091 --> 00:35:03,110
going back to the gene and environment
pitch like it is like you can control

621
00:35:03,111 --> 00:35:03,621
your environment,

622
00:35:03,621 --> 00:35:06,320
you can't control your genes but
you can control your environment.

623
00:35:06,321 --> 00:35:09,770
And we are trying to make
those discoveries about
what in your environment is

624
00:35:09,771 --> 00:35:11,810
potentially going to influence your genes.
The most

625
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:16,490
people who are fearful about putting
their information into the system.

626
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:21,800
One thing explain hearing is how do I
know that my genetic information will not

627
00:35:21,801 --> 00:35:25,340
fall into the wrong hands. Like recently
we heard about another genetic company,

628
00:35:25,341 --> 00:35:26,690
I guess they were hacked or whatnot.

629
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:30,320
So for someone who's fearful about
sharing information to 23 and be like,

630
00:35:30,321 --> 00:35:33,380
what would you say to them? It was
one of the things early on, um,

631
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,880
for people who are privacy.

632
00:35:34,881 --> 00:35:37,290
We spent a lot of time with
privacy experts in the early days.

633
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,050
And it was one of the
things I conclude early on,

634
00:35:39,051 --> 00:35:41,160
it was like for people who are like
really care, I was like, don't do it.

635
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:45,420
Just don't like spend the time
like get comfortable with it. Um,

636
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,840
you know what we can do as a company.
Um,

637
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:51,870
cause there's a lot of irrational fears
and that's why we used to say that as a

638
00:35:51,871 --> 00:35:55,830
company we have to do everything
we can to protect privacy.

639
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,870
Like there's fundamentally
no business model.

640
00:35:57,871 --> 00:36:02,850
Like I'm totally dependent on
my customer's participation
and their trust in

641
00:36:02,851 --> 00:36:05,820
what to do the research and to do
the types of things we want to do.

642
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,460
So I have no business model if I can't
protect the privacy of my customers. Um,

643
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:14,650
so we do a lot like from a database
infrastructure, how we set it up, um,

644
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:19,290
to even the fact that it's not a
swab. It is, uh, two mils of saliva.

645
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,840
We reject samples if we
don't get enough saliva.

646
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:26,070
So you can't be accidentally swapped
while you're sleeping. Like it's a lot,

647
00:36:26,071 --> 00:36:28,310
you'll never drool that
much in your sleep. Um,

648
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:33,000
and so we've set up the company and
also we don't have what we call it,

649
00:36:33,001 --> 00:36:36,510
like the legal chain of custody.
So if you order five kits,

650
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:40,230
I have no idea if you spat or if you
gave them a way to five random people in

651
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:44,770
this room. So I don't have the direct
tracing back to two individuals. Um,

652
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:47,130
from our terms of service as
well. We've, we've, you know,

653
00:36:47,131 --> 00:36:51,360
specifically said it's not to be
used for law enforcement. Um, and,

654
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:54,930
and we've set up the company in such a
way to make sure that it is really hard.

655
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:58,560
Like we have not gotten a subpoena on
this. We've put out a transparency report.

656
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,710
Um, we would do everything we
can to fight a subpoena. Um,

657
00:37:01,711 --> 00:37:05,580
it hasn't happened for us, but those
are the types of things where, um,

658
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:09,380
for people who are really, really
concerned, like just don't do it. Um,

659
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:13,400
for people who like are comfortable
with being on the web, um,

660
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:17,310
we do everything we can to
protect their privacy. Um,

661
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,840
and one of the core elements,

662
00:37:18,841 --> 00:37:20,970
like one of the leading privacy
experts when the things he taught me,

663
00:37:20,971 --> 00:37:21,331
it was like,

664
00:37:21,331 --> 00:37:25,500
look in what privacy people really
want is they want choice and they want

665
00:37:25,501 --> 00:37:27,060
transparency.
They want to know.

666
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:31,200
So if you're a 23 and me and you
don't want to share your data,

667
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:34,530
like don't share it and we have,
we have to respect that.

668
00:37:34,531 --> 00:37:38,010
So if you don't want to participate in
research, you don't have to participate.

669
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:41,670
If you don't want to share your genetic
data with me, don't share it. Um,

670
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:44,910
if you want to share it with, you
know, five people in this room,

671
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,200
we allow you to share it.

672
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,560
So we've given you a lot of controls
and that's also one of the things that's

673
00:37:49,561 --> 00:37:51,360
relatively atypical and health care.

674
00:37:51,361 --> 00:37:53,550
Like if you wanted to share
your medical record with me,

675
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,830
it would be almost impossible.
Um,

676
00:37:55,860 --> 00:38:00,780
so we do a lot to make sure that we're
like empowering people to have that

677
00:38:00,781 --> 00:38:05,190
privacy. Um, and then have also the
ability to, to compare when they want.

678
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,950
One of the things that I just
say about there is like when,

679
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,890
when people in general talk about privacy,
um,

680
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,530
like if I picked anyone
randomly in this room,

681
00:38:13,531 --> 00:38:16,680
like I'm sure your genetics would be
really interesting and I would love to see

682
00:38:16,681 --> 00:38:20,010
them. Um, but your bank account
is always much more interesting.

683
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:24,730
And so from a desire to hack in to,
you know,

684
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:28,050
one or the other,
your bank is just a lot more interesting.

685
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:32,280
And so when I look at like everyone's Dna,
um,

686
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:37,030
and when I think about privacy, it's,
it's significantly less on a mass area.

687
00:38:37,031 --> 00:38:40,390
But what you see is like within a family,
people will say,

688
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,520
I want to see if my
brother was really related.

689
00:38:42,521 --> 00:38:45,220
Like it is he really my full brother.
Um,

690
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:49,210
and so you get some of those intro
family privacy questions rather than

691
00:38:49,211 --> 00:38:51,280
necessarily a broad sweep.

692
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:54,490
No. On a policy level,
are there things at 23,

693
00:38:54,491 --> 00:38:58,390
are there policies or legislation that
23 me is backing from the federal level?

694
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:58,990
That's,

695
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:00,370
we,
back in the early days,

696
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:03,820
there was something called the genetic
information nondiscrimination act and it

697
00:39:03,821 --> 00:39:08,590
passed unanimously
bipartisan. Um, it is a,

698
00:39:08,591 --> 00:39:12,610
it's the, it prevents, it
prevents insurance companies,

699
00:39:12,611 --> 00:39:16,570
health insurance companies and employers
from using genetic information for

700
00:39:16,571 --> 00:39:20,710
discrimination. So that was a
huge step for us. It does not,

701
00:39:20,711 --> 00:39:24,220
it leaves health insurance
outside. Um, I'm sorry,

702
00:39:24,221 --> 00:39:28,010
it leaves life insurance outside.
Um, but that was, that was, uh,

703
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:32,650
a pretty significant step forward in
terms of giving federal protection to help

704
00:39:32,651 --> 00:39:35,500
people feel comfortable that they
can keep their genetic information to

705
00:39:35,501 --> 00:39:36,334
themselves,

706
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:40,480
ruin the life insurance aspect is or
other legislation that's going to be pros

707
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,270
in the future.

708
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:44,690
I haven't seen anything. Um, now,

709
00:39:44,691 --> 00:39:47,690
and it's interesting to me because it's
been 10 years and there hasn't really

710
00:39:47,691 --> 00:39:52,020
been any movement or any interest
necessarily from life insurance on it. Um,

711
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,920
the reality we find too is genetic
information is complicated.

712
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:59,090
Like it's not well understood
yet. So exactly how would
you, like, we already know,

713
00:39:59,091 --> 00:40:03,140
like some of the biggest risk factor
is obesity, smoking. Um, you know,

714
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:07,400
like those are, those are the biggest
out there. So other than like, okay,

715
00:40:07,401 --> 00:40:11,000
you're genetically high
risk for a condition that we
just don't fully understand

716
00:40:11,001 --> 00:40:12,290
yet.
Um,

717
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:16,670
like I'm much more optimistic about
like in my dream world that we would

718
00:40:16,671 --> 00:40:20,510
actually have insurance. Insurance
companies are embracing it and says, okay,

719
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:23,630
you're genetically high risk for
a blood clot and you're a woman.

720
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,870
You potentially are higher risk
than for miscarriage and pregnancy.

721
00:40:26,871 --> 00:40:30,650
We're going to try to like mitigate those
rest by, you know, x number of measures.

722
00:40:30,651 --> 00:40:34,160
Like there's things I wish the healthcare
system would adopt with genetic

723
00:40:34,161 --> 00:40:39,050
information rather than being reactive.
But that hasn't really happened yet.

724
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:43,550
So going forward for the next 10
years of 23 and me like where,

725
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:45,260
where do you see yourself as a company?

726
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:46,890
I think,
um,

727
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:51,680
one of the most interesting things I see
happening finally is that there is an

728
00:40:51,681 --> 00:40:55,370
interesting world of virtual
health care. So you know, like Vic,

729
00:40:55,371 --> 00:40:59,120
who used to run Google plus here, who's
now at a company called alive core. Um,

730
00:40:59,330 --> 00:40:59,631
you know,

731
00:40:59,631 --> 00:41:04,631
my dad has afib and he has a little
device on his phone that measures your EKG

732
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:08,510
and it will tell you whether you're an
atrial fibrillation. Like, that's amazing.

733
00:41:08,511 --> 00:41:11,630
It's totally amazing.
Like you don't have to go in it.

734
00:41:11,631 --> 00:41:13,370
Like you can get instant
real time information.

735
00:41:13,371 --> 00:41:17,480
We are on the beach in Hawaii
and he's like, oh, I'm an
a fib. Um, like it's, it's,

736
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:21,230
so it's utterly amazing.

737
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,260
And I think that there is,
um,

738
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:28,460
there's genuinely a world that is coming
where you're going to be able to get a

739
00:41:28,461 --> 00:41:32,720
lot of your healthcare on your phone and
is it taking a picture of your mole and

740
00:41:32,721 --> 00:41:34,790
then it in and you can
get multiple opinions.

741
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:38,060
Is it someone like grand rounds where
you get multiple opinions online?

742
00:41:38,061 --> 00:41:40,250
Like there's,
there's like one of,

743
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:44,660
one of the things I'm really hopeful for
is that healthcare becomes less about

744
00:41:44,661 --> 00:41:49,400
the art of medicine and much more data
driven where you get some, you know,

745
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:53,810
a number of people, a number of
opinions looking at a case. And, um,

746
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,940
and you can have like, again,
on the thing like a mole,

747
00:41:56,090 --> 00:42:00,110
you can really apply machine learning
to that. And so what are ways,

748
00:42:00,111 --> 00:42:03,890
like I see a whole new world
that is really cropping up. Um,

749
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:08,150
and whether it's going to be, you know,
some kind of Chat Bot that's telemedicine.

750
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:10,160
Like there's a lot that's happening there.

751
00:42:10,161 --> 00:42:12,140
So when I think about 23 and me's role,

752
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:17,210
I think that we become the hub and a
large part like we are like your genetic

753
00:42:17,211 --> 00:42:20,510
information is the core. It's like
the genetic code of you. It's, it is,

754
00:42:20,511 --> 00:42:24,080
it's like it's the digital
representation of you. And so we're the,

755
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:28,460
we're the epicenter of it and then helping
you figure out all the different ways

756
00:42:28,461 --> 00:42:31,760
that you can navigate that information
and what can you do with that information.

757
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:35,240
And we can't do that alone.
Like that's where we need partners.

758
00:42:35,241 --> 00:42:39,110
Like I need ways that you
could potentially analyze
your blood at home instantly

759
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,990
or that you could get, you
know, you could, you know,

760
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,320
take a picture of your mole and have it
analyzed like a whole way that you can

761
00:42:45,321 --> 00:42:48,790
actually start to think about measuring
yourself at home. Not In like,

762
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,290
like the quantified self movement is,
is more extreme,

763
00:42:51,291 --> 00:42:55,340
but like ways like the average individual
wants to just like be healthy and

764
00:42:55,341 --> 00:42:58,910
proactive. So I think that there's
a whole new world that is coming up,

765
00:42:58,911 --> 00:43:03,170
which is almost virtual healthcare.
And I think the brick and mortar is,

766
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:06,860
um, you know, we'll always have hospitals
and we'll always have brick and mortar,

767
00:43:06,861 --> 00:43:11,030
but, um, you know, the same way.
There's blockbusters out there. So, um,

768
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:15,230
there's not a lot. Um, and I think that
more and more you're going to see that.

769
00:43:15,231 --> 00:43:15,381
Like,

770
00:43:15,381 --> 00:43:19,100
I don't think that you doctor's visits
are going to be very different in the

771
00:43:19,101 --> 00:43:21,970
future. And I think that's where, um,

772
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:26,330
my hope is like the research that 23 and
me can do is that we will make a number

773
00:43:26,331 --> 00:43:28,550
of discoveries about, you know, what does,

774
00:43:28,551 --> 00:43:32,120
what is the meaning of a genetic
information and then also what are really

775
00:43:32,121 --> 00:43:35,420
meaningful ways that you can
prevent. And, and that's like,

776
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:38,720
when I think about my ultimate
success, it's, you know, I
would like to have cures.

777
00:43:38,721 --> 00:43:41,060
I'd love to have a cure for
Parkinson's and other diseases.

778
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:43,680
And that is a high priority
and we're fucking on that. Um,

779
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:46,370
but I'd also love to be able
to tell a 20 year old like,

780
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,610
this is what you need to do to be able
to live, to be healthy at a hundred. And,

781
00:43:50,611 --> 00:43:53,180
and to me that's like,
that's, that's real success.

782
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:58,010
So it was kind of goes into
life extension, life extension.

783
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:00,230
I'm excited. It's like it's, it's again,

784
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:03,800
there's a lot of silicon valley discussion
of like, Oh I want to live to a 500.

785
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:04,790
Um,

786
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:09,260
I think it's like my goal is like very
like I would just like to be healthy at a

787
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:13,340
hundred. Um, like when I
read stories about, you know,

788
00:44:13,341 --> 00:44:17,180
like a hundred year olds
running the marathons and
like doing things like that's

789
00:44:17,181 --> 00:44:20,390
what you want to do. I don't want
to be like in a critical care unit,

790
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:24,110
like supported at a hundred.
Like, no, I want to be healthy.

791
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:28,010
Like I don't want to be diabetic and
have congestive heart disease. Like no,

792
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:31,410
like just let me be healthy.
And tell me how, and again,

793
00:44:31,411 --> 00:44:35,520
it goes back to this like mantra of like
health is what you do every single day.

794
00:44:35,521 --> 00:44:38,620
Like I dress like this because
like I'm, I'm Googley. Um,

795
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:42,030
but also because I exercise all the
time, like I biked here, I'll bike back,

796
00:44:42,031 --> 00:44:44,220
I'll bike home.
Like I'm always like,

797
00:44:44,221 --> 00:44:47,310
I love to humiliate people in the office
when they take the elevator. I'm like,

798
00:44:47,311 --> 00:44:51,350
why? Like why would you do that? Why
would he do it in front of me too? Um,

799
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:56,610
so I think it's really important to like
get some of those types of messages out.

800
00:44:57,090 --> 00:44:59,640
Excellent. Um, so now we're going
to go to audience questions.

801
00:44:59,641 --> 00:45:02,790
So if anyone has a question,
please head over to the mic.

802
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:05,220
There's a mic right there.
You can just,

803
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:08,263
yeah,

804
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:15,870
when a check for online questions
too. Okay. You hear me? Hi,

805
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:18,720
I'm Dina on their went,

806
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:22,920
when they go to the doctor within
23 and me report the doctor,

807
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:26,300
typically the tell me
something like, hey, why,

808
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:29,910
why do you need these as I
did something wrong. Now,

809
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,310
why do you do have the d without
asking a doctor first hand? So my,

810
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:38,350
one of my [inaudible] is if you're
doing something to educate them in that

811
00:45:38,821 --> 00:45:41,120
sense.
And also when I see them,

812
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:44,340
the possibilities to get a disease,

813
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:47,130
they are all taking into account,

814
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:49,600
compare it with a m people,

815
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:53,230
coca sick people in Europe
because most researchers,

816
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:59,100
but I'm from Latin America, so I don't
feel represented. I know that my,

817
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:04,080
my question is if we're going to do
Samson to have more samples from that

818
00:46:04,081 --> 00:46:07,230
region. Yeah. So like I know that my test,

819
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:12,290
the results are more accuracy and
also for something or Santina you,

820
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:17,400
you don't have that. I mean, you can't use
20:00 PM. You have to come here. Right.

821
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:18,533
So,

822
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:22,860
yeah. So first question on physicians
and second on International. Um,

823
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:26,990
so physicians are definitely the
last mile. Like it's painful for us.

824
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:28,430
And um,

825
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:31,040
and it's disappointing to me because
we get a lot of people who take their

826
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:35,720
reports to physicians and the physician
says, oh, this is not worthwhile. Um,

827
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:36,800
so you're not alone in that.

828
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:39,700
And we've tried some initiatives
and the early initiatives to,

829
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,210
to work with an educate doctors.

830
00:46:41,211 --> 00:46:45,260
And I always joke if I took a thousand
kits to Stanford shopping center and I

831
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:48,250
was like, these are free, they
would be gone in five minutes. Um,

832
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:52,190
if I took a thousand kits to asco,
the big oncology meeting,

833
00:46:52,370 --> 00:46:55,350
I would come home with 990 of them.
Um,

834
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:59,420
like we've literally tried to give away
kits to doctors and they're like, oh no.

835
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:01,280
Um,
so there's a huge,

836
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:05,870
there's a lot of work that we have to
do to engage the medical community.

837
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:09,710
Um, one thing that I have
found is that there's like,

838
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:11,720
there's a new crop of physicians,

839
00:47:11,721 --> 00:47:14,540
like a lot of doctors who are
online and the telemedicine,

840
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:17,300
and it's something that we're thinking
about is how do we cultivate the

841
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:22,070
physicians who are trying to embrace
a world of prevention and like,

842
00:47:22,071 --> 00:47:25,100
what could you do with this? And it's,
it's hard because like, it's not,

843
00:47:25,101 --> 00:47:26,480
it's not a big reimbursements.

844
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:31,240
Like any way you can go to
any dermatologist and get
botox like today in the

845
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:34,150
next hour. And if you said, I want to
get a mole check, they'll be like, oh,

846
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:37,510
in October I have time at nine. Um, so,

847
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:41,340
and that's because a mole check doesn't
reimburse, but botox botoxes you know,

848
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:44,530
$300 in 15 minutes. So, um,

849
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:47,920
so I think that's where like we have
a lot to do to try to work with the

850
00:47:47,921 --> 00:47:49,890
physician world. We're
hiring someone. Like that's,

851
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:53,260
that's like a big initiative for me on
the team is how do we engage the medical

852
00:47:53,261 --> 00:47:55,720
world. Um, second on international,

853
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:58,570
the same way we had
regulatory issues here.

854
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,750
The rest of the world is pretty
complicated and there's a lot of

855
00:48:01,751 --> 00:48:04,120
misunderstanding about genetics.
Um,

856
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:09,180
so each country has laws about how to
enter into those countries and they're

857
00:48:09,731 --> 00:48:13,810
pretty complicated. It's almost
like we just haven't had, like,

858
00:48:13,811 --> 00:48:17,110
I think a lot of startups fail because
they try to do too much, too early.

859
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:20,560
So we think about international
and honestly, like again,

860
00:48:20,561 --> 00:48:22,180
going back to the love of hacks,

861
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:25,120
one of the ways I thought about
just hacking it is just like,

862
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:30,310
just be in like JFK in Miami and like
tried it because then you can actually

863
00:48:30,311 --> 00:48:35,070
pull a lot of diversity in
without necessarily having
so or like in the reality

864
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:39,790
is like the u s is this like
beautiful melting pot where if I want,

865
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:42,400
you know, instead of going into
China, which is really complicated,

866
00:48:42,401 --> 00:48:45,310
like I can go to San Francisco.
And so like for me,

867
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:48,430
part of it is making sure that we're
recruiting the right populations.

868
00:48:48,431 --> 00:48:51,520
And so we are looking specifically
at targeting different groups.

869
00:48:51,521 --> 00:48:55,900
Like we have a big African American
initiative. Um, you know, we have a, uh,

870
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:59,500
a whole global initiative
of like countries where
we're trying to get specific

871
00:48:59,501 --> 00:49:04,330
populations, um, both for
the ancestry testing so that
we can improve our product.

872
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:07,210
But also then for having the
diversity in health research.

873
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:09,490
So I'm going to take it online question,

874
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:14,560
who owns the Ip produced
from an individual's geno
typing data when they use 23

875
00:49:14,561 --> 00:49:19,230
and me. So there's no IP in
that capacity. So like if you,

876
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:23,050
you own what happens, like if
you spit, you own your data, um,

877
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:26,650
if you consent for research, you're
consenting to be part of this aggregate.

878
00:49:26,651 --> 00:49:31,070
So for instance, of I discover
that um, you know, here's a gym,

879
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:35,620
like I talk about 400,000 people
participated in the depression study.

880
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:40,740
And so, um, there's not IP on, on genes,

881
00:49:40,741 --> 00:49:43,660
so we're not filing patents for instance,
on like,

882
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:47,680
Oh this genetic association is part
of parking of you know, depression.

883
00:49:47,681 --> 00:49:51,970
So there's no IP on that.
We might say, oh this, this,

884
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:55,000
this mutation looks like
it's potentially in a,

885
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:59,320
in an area where it's
potentially druggable we then
make a small molecule or an

886
00:49:59,321 --> 00:50:01,600
antibody and we're going to target that.

887
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:06,370
That is rip because like in some ways
it's so far down stream from everything.

888
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:10,060
Our hope is like we are publishing
and putting out into the public world,

889
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:12,820
like all of the genetic
associations that we're finding.

890
00:50:12,821 --> 00:50:16,610
So we'd like to publish a lot. We have
over 100 publications out there. Um,

891
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:19,150
but we really look at like
the longterm downstream.

892
00:50:19,151 --> 00:50:22,540
Like we're owning that Ip because
we're putting in like, again,

893
00:50:22,541 --> 00:50:25,510
what's going to end up being hundreds of
millions of dollars of work into trying

894
00:50:25,511 --> 00:50:27,010
to make successful

895
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:32,150
shall be curious. Right. Man, thank you
so much for coming. I'm really inspired.

896
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:32,891
I'm no good.

897
00:50:32,891 --> 00:50:37,370
I'm think Google doodles pm I wanted to
ask about how you attract and retain so

898
00:50:37,371 --> 00:50:40,280
many women I have from everyone
and I talked to in your company,

899
00:50:40,281 --> 00:50:43,340
they're so happy. They're, how do
you do it? Especially now really,

900
00:50:43,341 --> 00:50:46,090
especially now that so many
women are feeling like they're,

901
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,020
they can stay in tech.
Her,

902
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:52,460
I um, you know, we had a
problem for a while where, um,

903
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:53,430
we were like,

904
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:58,430
we were trying really hard to hire a
man for the management team and it was

905
00:50:59,221 --> 00:51:02,060
like, man, there were looking for
a head of engineering at one point.

906
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:05,250
I remember we just like, we had this woman
and we're like, no, no, no, we need a man.

907
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:09,630
Like we need Wiley's one. Um, so I think,

908
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:13,080
um, I mean I think it's
like all aspects of diverse.

909
00:51:13,081 --> 00:51:17,880
Like I think we've tried really hard
to have a supportive environment.

910
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:21,300
And for me, like I've worked,
I always had, I was like,

911
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:22,680
I've worked for really bad people.

912
00:51:22,681 --> 00:51:26,700
I worked for like some really
complicated funds. Like I was like,

913
00:51:26,701 --> 00:51:28,800
who in the room has
anyone who's been in jail?

914
00:51:28,801 --> 00:51:30,420
Like I have bosses who have been in jail.

915
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:35,010
So like I've worked for like some
really, um, challenging individuals.

916
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:39,570
So I know what it's like. Um, and
I'm trying to do the exact opposite.

917
00:51:39,571 --> 00:51:43,140
Like the first job I ever had, um,
the Wallenberg family in Sweden,

918
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:46,080
they were amazing. Like, I've never,
like, they treated me so well,

919
00:51:46,081 --> 00:51:48,630
so I know what it's like to have
a bad job in a bad environment.

920
00:51:48,631 --> 00:51:52,320
I know what it's like to have a great
environment. And in Sweden for instance,

921
00:51:52,321 --> 00:51:55,950
like this woman showed up one day and I
was like, who are you? And she was like,

922
00:51:55,951 --> 00:51:59,190
oh, I'm newly promoted partner. I've
been on maternity leave for two years.

923
00:51:59,191 --> 00:52:03,240
And I was like, what? Um, so it, like,

924
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:06,900
it was one of those things like
culturally it's set to me like,

925
00:52:06,901 --> 00:52:08,510
here's a group of people,
the Walmart,

926
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:12,300
like who promoted this woman who's like
been on maternity leave for two years.

927
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:13,320
It was amazing.

928
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:17,550
And so I really try to create a culture
where we support people through their

929
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:20,340
lifecycle. And um, you know,

930
00:52:20,341 --> 00:52:24,630
a lot of people have been at the company
who they get married, they've had kids,

931
00:52:24,631 --> 00:52:25,770
they get divorced.
Like,

932
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:30,630
like there's a whole lifecycle and
not everyone is awesome every day.

933
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:35,010
And so like you can be awesome for a while
and then you have a kid and it's like,

934
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:37,770
and the kid sick for a while and
you have take off time. Like,

935
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:42,160
I can't be the asshole boss. It's like, oh
my God, you're out. Um, like I have like,

936
00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:46,110
I have to support people and I look
at people for the psalm of like,

937
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:49,800
I hope people stay for 10 years and I
look at people for the song. But like,

938
00:52:49,801 --> 00:52:52,140
what can you,
can you contribute in that in that period?

939
00:52:52,141 --> 00:52:55,200
And like how do we also support you?
Um,

940
00:52:55,350 --> 00:52:58,920
we're really very much like
your family is your family,

941
00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:01,110
but like we're your family away from home.

942
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:06,330
And so like I have to support people in
a good way and I have to listen. Um, and,

943
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:08,340
and I think it's like
there's a level of humility.

944
00:53:08,341 --> 00:53:11,460
Like the number one thing we
have for hiring is humility.

945
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:15,210
Like you need really smart people,
but like I just,

946
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:19,770
the culturally like you gotta fit in
with the humility and we have to support

947
00:53:19,771 --> 00:53:20,604
people.
Paul,

948
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:26,250
thank you. Welcome. Hey,

949
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,060
thanks for doing this. Of course. Um,

950
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:32,570
so I know there might be some liabilities
associated with the idea I'm about to

951
00:53:32,571 --> 00:53:32,871
mention,

952
00:53:32,871 --> 00:53:37,871
but is there some time when this would
be an opportunity finding tool as well,

953
00:53:38,811 --> 00:53:42,920
that your DNA seems like you would be
perfect for pole vaulting? So, you know,

954
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:46,680
practical that we do.
Um,

955
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:52,010
you know, I don't know if we'll ever
get down to those types of specifics.

956
00:53:52,011 --> 00:53:56,290
Like I think, um, um, you know,

957
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,700
I think that there's like for sprinting,
you know,

958
00:53:58,701 --> 00:54:02,220
there's genetic variants associated with
like, do you have the double twitch? Um,

959
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:06,800
will it ever refine enough to be
able to say like, Oh, you know,

960
00:54:06,801 --> 00:54:09,770
you're really great at this
specific sport. I think, again,

961
00:54:09,771 --> 00:54:12,780
it goes back to the world of genes
and environment. Like you, you,

962
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:17,090
you need passion to be great at anything
you need passion. Like the, the,

963
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:21,950
the most important aspect for me out of
that movie Gattica was that this guy has

964
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:26,090
a genetic, like he's genetically not
likely to survive for some reason,

965
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:31,070
but he has the passion and like
passionate counts for so much. Um,

966
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:34,370
so I think without a doubt you'll
hear things like if you are,

967
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,320
we did some research at
one point on, um, um,

968
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:41,930
and like being toned down or like
having a, a musical ear and you know,

969
00:54:41,931 --> 00:54:46,100
you could imagine at some point like,
would you say, okay, like, hey, you know,

970
00:54:46,101 --> 00:54:49,040
you're just not like you just,
if you want to be a pianist,

971
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:52,710
you're going to have to work that much
harder. So I think it's, you know,

972
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:56,060
and we're like, we did a study for
them since in weight loss. Like we,

973
00:54:56,090 --> 00:55:00,200
my hope one day is to be able to
say, if you're overweight, you,

974
00:55:00,470 --> 00:55:02,990
it's only gonna take you four
weeks to lose weight. You,

975
00:55:02,991 --> 00:55:04,310
it's going to take you seven weeks.

976
00:55:04,311 --> 00:55:07,910
Like you're just genetically more likely
to not be able to lose that weight.

977
00:55:07,911 --> 00:55:11,900
And I think that's where it will help
people not say, not know like, oh,

978
00:55:11,901 --> 00:55:13,130
you're not going to be great at this,

979
00:55:13,131 --> 00:55:16,880
but like you just might have to work
harder instead of the famous 10,000 hours.

980
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:20,360
You need 12,000 hours.
Yeah. Cool. Thank you. Okay.

981
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:25,450
Hi. Thanks for coming. This is very
interesting. Um, so I was wondering,

982
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:29,870
I noticed that, I mean, so there's 23 and
me, but there's also lots of other, um,

983
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:32,200
lots of other sort of
similar con, um, companies.

984
00:55:32,201 --> 00:55:35,610
So if you're looking at sort of
ancestry yeah, you get to Lincoln,

985
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:38,650
find out your relatives
who are with 23 and me,

986
00:55:38,651 --> 00:55:41,200
but then there's people who
are with other companies.

987
00:55:41,201 --> 00:55:42,910
It seems like everything's kind of siloed.

988
00:55:42,911 --> 00:55:46,330
Have you thought about talking to other
companies and seeing if there are ways

989
00:55:46,331 --> 00:55:50,680
that you can connect across each other's
databases to help people find relatives?

990
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,810
Yeah, I think, um, with other companies,
we did a promotion for instance,

991
00:55:54,811 --> 00:55:59,520
on Dna day where we allow people from
ancestry.com to upload their data. Um,

992
00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:01,650
you know, the companies are
pretty competitive right now,

993
00:56:01,651 --> 00:56:06,651
so there hasn't been any specific
initiative to like try like you can always

994
00:56:07,891 --> 00:56:12,750
download and I think upload.
Um, so, so no, I mean I,

995
00:56:12,751 --> 00:56:13,770
it's,
it's a problem.

996
00:56:13,771 --> 00:56:17,340
Like it's not in the best interest of
customers for sure to not allow, like,

997
00:56:17,341 --> 00:56:19,670
I would think that that would actually
be something that's great. But like,

998
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,080
I think there's a lot of competition
right now, so that hasn't,

999
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:25,270
that hasn't happened.
Um, but without a doubt,

1000
00:56:25,271 --> 00:56:27,790
like we know that people who
are looking for family members,

1001
00:56:27,791 --> 00:56:32,680
oftentimes we'll do both services.
Yeah. Okay. So, and, and again,

1002
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:34,510
we might do more in the future.
Um,

1003
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:38,350
and in some ways this goes with some
of the privacy issues like we had. Um,

1004
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:40,150
so again, when you talk about
the goal and say killer,

1005
00:56:40,151 --> 00:56:43,240
like one of the things that's important
for us to do from a privacy perspective

1006
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:48,430
is not allow a relative matches
from DNA that's uploaded, right?

1007
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:49,900
Because if you allow that,

1008
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:52,810
then you open up the door for
things like the golden state killer.

1009
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:57,160
And so we had like, for instance, when
we did this promotion with, um, you know,

1010
00:56:57,161 --> 00:56:59,260
anyone could upload their
DNA from other places.

1011
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:02,380
We would tell you if there was
someone within your close circle,

1012
00:57:02,381 --> 00:57:05,070
but we want to identify who
it is and we did that. So,

1013
00:57:05,090 --> 00:57:08,740
and you would have to spit again. And we
did that specifically so that you like,

1014
00:57:08,741 --> 00:57:11,500
from a privacy perspective,
we think a lot about privacy.

1015
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:13,840
Cool. Thanks. Okay.

1016
00:57:16,590 --> 00:57:20,190
Oh, hi. I'm so sorry. I have some,
my, a spit and then I'd get it back.

1017
00:57:20,191 --> 00:57:23,160
And then it tells me about,
um, like my ancestry and uh,

1018
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:26,360
well my health prospects,
um,

1019
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:29,670
say I have like a,
like what would it be like,

1020
00:57:29,790 --> 00:57:32,940
is there a way I can prevent myself
from having like cancer in the future?

1021
00:57:32,941 --> 00:57:34,380
Like just off of that,

1022
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:36,660
we don't have, so the, the,

1023
00:57:36,730 --> 00:57:39,940
the cancer report we have right now
is the breast cancer report that is

1024
00:57:39,941 --> 00:57:43,120
associated with, um, typically, you know,

1025
00:57:43,121 --> 00:57:46,360
Ashkenazi Jewish descent and um,

1026
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:48,520
and it does have a high
penetration of cancer.

1027
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:51,730
So meaning like those people
are likely to get cancer.

1028
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:55,060
What we found people have done is they
go and they get either mastectomy or they

1029
00:57:55,061 --> 00:57:59,950
take out their ovaries. Um, so
there's ways that you can potentially,

1030
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:03,580
like it's extreme to
prevent. Um, you know,

1031
00:58:03,581 --> 00:58:05,860
the other thing that's out there
is there are, for instance,

1032
00:58:05,861 --> 00:58:08,110
there's people who are genetically
high risk for colon cancer.

1033
00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:09,790
And in that capacity,
you know,

1034
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:13,300
right now I think the recommendations
or coal colonoscopies at 45,

1035
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:17,620
in that case you could start having
colonoscopies earlier. So a lot of it,

1036
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:21,010
there's not necessarily
known specifics about, okay,

1037
00:58:21,011 --> 00:58:24,270
if you want to prevent cancer, these
are the things that you do. Um,

1038
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:27,520
in every disease area you can say,
you know,

1039
00:58:27,521 --> 00:58:30,670
don't smoke exercise and eat better.

1040
00:58:30,910 --> 00:58:34,870
And what we find that having something
that is a risk factor in black and white

1041
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:38,380
in your DNA motivates people to
actually do all those things.

1042
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:42,490
But those are the biggest swing factors
you have always as your exercise and

1043
00:58:42,491 --> 00:58:45,430
your diet and your environment.
Okay. Thank you. Okay.

1044
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:48,400
Hi,

1045
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:53,400
my name is Yulia and I'm an intern in
Google brain genomics and it looks like

1046
00:58:53,741 --> 00:58:58,741
Google is also looking into like
genetics and predicting disease from,

1047
00:58:59,530 --> 00:59:02,270
from genetics and also
connected to healthcare. Yeah,

1048
00:59:02,350 --> 00:59:06,910
I know that also Microsoft is
looking into healthcare and genetics.

1049
00:59:07,150 --> 00:59:08,800
So what do you think about this?
Like,

1050
00:59:08,801 --> 00:59:13,801
do you think that you will collaborate
with Google or Microsoft at some point or

1051
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:19,680
your be competitors or 23 minutes so far
ahead in this research that I think so.

1052
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:24,110
I, I've spent a lot of time,
like in, in the early days,

1053
00:59:24,111 --> 00:59:26,960
like back when we were starting the
company, like Google, Microsoft,

1054
00:59:26,990 --> 00:59:31,550
others like Microsoft had had um, RFPs
out for a while doing genetic research.

1055
00:59:31,551 --> 00:59:36,200
They've had a great, you know, they
have, they had a really great team. Um,

1056
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:40,190
you know, Google brain team is
amazing. Um, I know Jeff Dean, well,

1057
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:43,010
like it's an amazing group
of people that are there.

1058
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:47,390
The number one problem in healthcare
I find is nobody has the Dataset.

1059
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:50,660
Like I love going to big data meetings
and everyone's like talking about big

1060
00:59:50,661 --> 00:59:54,860
data and I'm like, but you don't have
any data. Like, I mean, it's just,

1061
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:58,130
it's fascinating. I'm like, I'm like,
it's like the emperor has no clothes.

1062
00:59:58,131 --> 01:00:01,190
People like, there's not a
lot of data out there. So,

1063
01:00:01,830 --> 01:00:05,570
I mean there's some of
these big initiatives and my
whole goal was like I want

1064
01:00:05,571 --> 01:00:08,540
the data like 23 and me's initial premise.
I was like,

1065
01:00:08,570 --> 01:00:10,460
you need to generate the data first.

1066
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:15,670
And so the number one thing that we
have is we have a massive living dataset

1067
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:20,120
where when I can go back to my customers
and say, okay, do you have migraines?

1068
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:21,800
Can you tell me more information?

1069
01:00:21,801 --> 01:00:25,520
And for those customers who want to
participate, they can tell me more.

1070
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:26,563
And so it's,

1071
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:29,450
it's one of the things like there's the
UK biobank and there's all these other

1072
01:00:29,451 --> 01:00:31,730
biobanks out there,
but they're static.

1073
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:37,250
Like we did this project with this one
group in the UK and I requested sample,

1074
01:00:37,251 --> 01:00:39,950
it was a recontact double database.
I requested samples.

1075
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:43,070
Three years later they called me and
they're like, we have the samples.

1076
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:46,970
I was like, who are you? Like
what is, I was like, oh yeah,

1077
01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:51,500
like that's their definition or be
contactable like in this world of the

1078
01:00:51,501 --> 01:00:56,430
Internet age, like just text me or
like send me a message like habit,

1079
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:00,220
like show up as an alert on my phone.
So that's the main thing, like the, the,

1080
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:02,090
the key that we created.

1081
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:05,630
I needed to first create the data
before I can solve the problems.

1082
01:01:05,810 --> 01:01:08,480
There's amazing people out there
who can solve the problems,

1083
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:09,770
but it's really hard.

1084
01:01:09,770 --> 01:01:12,410
There's no one else out there who
has the amount of data we have.

1085
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:15,800
We'd love to like, and they
said, we, I know Jeff Dean,
I know that team. While if,

1086
01:01:15,801 --> 01:01:18,290
you know Lizzy, like all,
like we love that team.

1087
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:23,300
We're always open to working
or just join us. Like

1088
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:29,600
another question, last question. Okay. So,

1089
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:35,120
um, so I said that 23 and me's
hiring machine learning specialists.

1090
01:01:35,830 --> 01:01:36,581
So do we check,

1091
01:01:36,581 --> 01:01:41,581
send does 23 and me use machine learning
or is it mostly looking into literature

1092
01:01:41,751 --> 01:01:45,500
and see what you, which variant is
connected to each disease from literature?

1093
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:46,610
So we do a lot.

1094
01:01:46,611 --> 01:01:50,300
We have a pipeline where we're doing
our own genome wide association studies

1095
01:01:50,301 --> 01:01:54,860
quite a bit. We are starting to do
a fair amount of machine learning,

1096
01:01:54,930 --> 01:01:57,530
um, and thinking about, so for instance,

1097
01:01:57,531 --> 01:02:00,950
like one of the first
applications probably is an
ancestry and helping people in

1098
01:02:00,951 --> 01:02:03,650
predicting ancestry.
Um,

1099
01:02:03,770 --> 01:02:06,590
we have a number of initiatives in house
and those are the types of things we

1100
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:10,940
thought of. But like, again, with, with
all of, with all of the data that we have,

1101
01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:15,680
we're, we're right for all
those technologies now. Like,
like all the applications.

1102
01:02:15,890 --> 01:02:19,770
So again, my job is like being
somebody who's not technical is like,

1103
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:24,030
I'm trying to create first like this
massive enthusiasm from the world to

1104
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:25,590
participate in research and like,

1105
01:02:25,591 --> 01:02:29,430
to learn about their genetics and then
create data that has like the highest,

1106
01:02:29,431 --> 01:02:31,440
the data quality that we
need to do that research.

1107
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:35,850
And then to empower everybody with all
the different techniques and skills like

1108
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,490
to then analyze the data and what
can we do with it. Thank you. Okay.

1109
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,550
Well, Ann, thank you
very much for joining us.

1110
01:02:44,170 --> 01:02:47,120
[inaudible].
