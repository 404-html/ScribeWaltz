1
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,700
We have Olivia and Judah here.
Um,

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,150
Olivia wrote The New York Times
bestselling book called Charisma Myth.

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,440
If you haven't read it, it's amazing. Um,

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:19,550
and Judah works for Berkeley's
Haas business school and
also worked at Starbucks

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,700
and they recently wrote a book called
the Net and the butterfly, um, to,

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,280
to help you work on your creative process.
So without any further ado,

7
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:30,510
let's welcome them to Google

8
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,083
you.

9
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:38,440
So when we started doing
research for this book,

10
00:00:38,441 --> 00:00:41,020
we came upon this really wild pattern.

11
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,140
And so this is Leo's Dillard.

12
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,620
He went to a lecture in the late
thirties about nuclear physics.

13
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,800
And as he was walking across the street,
literally in mid stride,

14
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:55,440
he had this realization about how he
could start a nuclear chain reaction using

15
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:00,250
vision.
Then we get Henri palm cafe.

16
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,780
How'd I do? How'd I do, oh, he Pornchai
Olivia's native French speakers.

17
00:01:04,781 --> 00:01:07,360
Every time I come up a French
word, it's a nightmare. Kills me.

18
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:12,420
So he was working on an incredibly
difficult series of math functions.

19
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,610
And one morning as he was getting
on a bus to go to a conference,

20
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:18,760
he remembers this very distinctly.
He put his foot on the step,

21
00:01:18,761 --> 00:01:21,640
the first step of the bus,
and suddenly it came to him.

22
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:23,230
He knew what his answer was,

23
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:27,670
so then we come to Nicola Tesla who
is trying to work on a functioning,

24
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,420
alternating current generator. He's
walking through a park with his friends.

25
00:01:31,421 --> 00:01:34,600
When suddenly he realizes
exactly how he's going to do it.

26
00:01:34,601 --> 00:01:37,900
He needs one of the engines to rotate
in the opposite direction from the other

27
00:01:37,901 --> 00:01:40,270
two that had gone to be
part of the generator.

28
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,200
This also brings us to
Heisenberg Heisenberg, sorry.

29
00:01:44,201 --> 00:01:46,120
For those of you who are fans,
if you type hot,

30
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:49,540
if you now type Heisenberg into the
Google search engine, that's what you get.

31
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,770
He has now eclipsed Verner.
Walter has a coat's Verner Verner.

32
00:01:53,771 --> 00:01:57,850
Heisenberg has a conversation with Niels
Bohr and Copenhagen late night walking

33
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:59,810
home through a park.
What happens? He's like,

34
00:01:59,811 --> 00:02:02,140
can the universe really be
a strange as I think it is?

35
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:05,620
He comes up with the uncertainty
principle. This just keeps happening.

36
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:10,660
Girdle and Einstein famous for taking
walks together in Princeton at the

37
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:14,440
Institute for Advanced Study,
Darwin had something called the sand walk.

38
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,520
What he would do is he would start at
the corner there and he put a couple of

39
00:02:18,521 --> 00:02:18,941
stones,

40
00:02:18,941 --> 00:02:22,240
he'd stack them and he'd walk the sand
walk while he thought about the problem

41
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,300
and he'd knock a stone off every
lap. And he knew, he's like,

42
00:02:25,301 --> 00:02:28,180
this is a three stone problem.
There's a six stone problem.

43
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:31,960
But he would walk his way to the answer.
Same thing with Tchaikovsky,

44
00:02:31,961 --> 00:02:35,910
three hour walks every afternoon
and then we get Emmanuel con to it.

45
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,250
It said you could set your watch by his
walks cause he'd walk around the town

46
00:02:39,251 --> 00:02:42,310
square the same time every day.
You keep going back in history.

47
00:02:42,311 --> 00:02:43,210
It keeps showing up.

48
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,470
Aristotle who founded a school and they
were known as the peripatetics. Why?

49
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,610
Cause they walked around
as they philosophized and
then of course we had the

50
00:02:51,611 --> 00:02:53,980
famous story of Archimedes
who's stepping into the tub,

51
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,530
watches the water displacement
and suddenly realizes,

52
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,520
this is how I'm going to figure out
if the crown is solid gold or not by

53
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:04,480
checking its density.
Something very strange is going on,

54
00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:07,660
but the story keeps happening over
and over and it's not just walking.

55
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,730
It happens with sleep.
So this is Dimitri men delay.

56
00:03:10,731 --> 00:03:14,170
If you spent three years working on a
chemistry textbook driven crazy that he

57
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:16,720
couldn't put it into more order
and during a feverish nap,

58
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,650
woke up with a picture of this in his
head, wrote it down as fast as he could.

59
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,340
Okay,

60
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,430
who's our neck? Oh, you're
going to hate me again. August.

61
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,070
Yeah.

62
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:32,620
Are you going to make
me do it? You Go. Kukula

63
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,240
had I do know nightmare.
We're moving on.

64
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,940
So chemist and chemists,

65
00:03:39,941 --> 00:03:43,210
18 hundreds everybody's trying to figure
out the shape of benzene at the time.

66
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:44,080
Nobody can do it.

67
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,550
He has a dream of a snake eating its own
tail and suddenly realizes that benzine

68
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:52,570
is a rang. This literally creates
structural organic chemistry,

69
00:03:52,571 --> 00:03:55,650
which creates the tar
and die or industries.

70
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,220
It creates the pharmaceutical industries.

71
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,830
If you ever wondered why so many
pharmaceutical companies are German,

72
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:04,720
because he was German.
It started as first lab in Bond Ramanujan.

73
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:09,430
Famous numbers theorists from India used
to say that the goddess would write the

74
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:12,940
equations on his tongue and his dreams,
and so he'd wake up with stuff like this.

75
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:18,920
Finally Salvador Dali. Now he knew
exactly what he was doing was sleep.

76
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:22,700
He would sit down in a straight back
chair and he would hang his arm over the

77
00:04:22,701 --> 00:04:26,930
side holding a metal key with a metal
plate underneath and as he dozed off,

78
00:04:26,931 --> 00:04:30,290
he would drop the key and the key would
hit the plate, make a rattle, wake him up.

79
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,460
And as soon as he woke up,

80
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,360
he just start drawing and we all know
what those drawings ended up looking like.

81
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:38,930
So here we have all of these
geniuses who are accessing,

82
00:04:38,931 --> 00:04:43,520
walking and sleeping in different
ways to come up with these amazing

83
00:04:43,521 --> 00:04:46,700
breakthroughs. What is it that they
figured out? What did they know?

84
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:47,990
And as another example,

85
00:04:47,991 --> 00:04:50,960
I want to tell you that when I was
showering this morning thinking about this

86
00:04:50,961 --> 00:04:53,750
talk coming here, I suddenly realized
I wanted to show you all this.

87
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:55,443
Okay?

88
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:00,700
[inaudible]

89
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:10,800
I'm going to come back to that.

90
00:05:10,801 --> 00:05:12,540
I'm going to tell you why I wanted
to show you that in a minute.

91
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:14,790
It's not just cause it's
really funny with which it is.

92
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,410
We have the capacity to know so much.

93
00:05:19,411 --> 00:05:22,710
When we look up at the stars were
amazed at how many stars are,

94
00:05:22,711 --> 00:05:27,060
I were amazed at the sheer immensity
of the universe and our place in it.

95
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:29,850
But the reality is that
when we look up at the sky,

96
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,800
that's how much we're actually seeing.

97
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:33,680
Okay?

98
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,640
We are not truly aware
of how much is out there.

99
00:05:37,641 --> 00:05:39,950
We're not truly aware of
how much more we could see.

100
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,580
And the same is true of how
we access our own brains.

101
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:49,060
We are not aware of just how
much we have the capacity to do.

102
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:54,500
And what we wrote about in this book is
not only what is this physical mechanism

103
00:05:54,501 --> 00:05:59,300
inside everyone's brains, and I want to
be clear, it's, it's not just geniuses.

104
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:03,300
The geniuses have the same exact physical
structures in their brain that every

105
00:06:03,301 --> 00:06:06,590
one of you has.
But it's a question of accessing it.

106
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,940
It's a question of trusting it.

107
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:12,170
And so what we're gonna do is we're going
to talk a lot about tools because the

108
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:14,090
thing about breakthroughs,
creativity,

109
00:06:14,091 --> 00:06:17,720
innovation is there a lot of theories
and people lay out theories all the time.

110
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,210
But this is,
this is a craft.

111
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,840
This is like an artisan's
craft and just like artisans,

112
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:28,490
there are tools and you have to practice
with those tools in order to gain

113
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:32,060
mastery. And that's really what we
were interested in in this book.

114
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:35,060
So to explain what the
process is in your brain,

115
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,210
we made a short animation that we want
to show you and the story we're going to

116
00:06:38,211 --> 00:06:41,750
tell you is true and everything going
on inside the brain is also true.

117
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:51,900
Florida 1965 the rolling stones
are on their first US tour,

118
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,280
but they're not the rolling stones yet.

119
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:57,160
They're about as popular
as Herman's hermits.

120
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:59,680
What they're in need of is a breakthrough.

121
00:06:59,681 --> 00:07:04,570
Hit a number one song and no one
knows it more than Keith Richards.

122
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:08,950
One night in his motel room,
Richards was trying to write that song.

123
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:13,570
So what's going on inside his brain?
He's attempting to have this breakthrough.

124
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,380
This is the executive of Keith Richards,
his brain,

125
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:22,180
it's focused on task and has a goal.
Write a hit song.

126
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,560
There's just one problem. It's not
very good at breaking news by itself.

127
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,400
See the executive network is great when
you need to make a list or complete a

128
00:07:30,401 --> 00:07:34,270
project, but when it comes to having
a breakthrough, it needs some help.

129
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,720
That night Richard's fell asleep and no
longer on task is executive went to talk

130
00:07:40,301 --> 00:07:42,700
to another network that
lies deeper in the brain.

131
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:46,450
Now what we're about to show you
is not unique to Keith Richards.

132
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,900
You have the same exact room
in your brain. We all do.

133
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:55,120
We just don't access it enough.
This is your genius lounge,

134
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:00,100
about 10 different brain regions in here
all hanging out talking. There's Mozart,

135
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:02,920
Leonardo Davinci, Mary Curie, Einstein,

136
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:06,280
welcome to the part of your
brain that's working on stuff.

137
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,760
When you don't think you're
working on stuff that night,

138
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:14,230
Richard's is executive walked in
and said, quiet. All right everyone.

139
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,840
We need a breakthrough. Hit. Now go.

140
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:21,820
The executive went in busy itself,
but something mindless in this case sleep,

141
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:26,890
but it can be doing the dishes or the
laundry or taking a shower. Meanwhile,

142
00:08:26,891 --> 00:08:30,760
the geniuses started sharing all kinds
of information from art to music to

143
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:34,510
childhood memories.
This was the sum total of Keith Richards.

144
00:08:34,511 --> 00:08:38,620
His experience and knowledge and
the combining created his intuition.

145
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,780
It created a breakthrough.

146
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,720
Richard's woke up in the middle
of the night and began to play.

147
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,340
That was how the rolling stones got
their breakthrough hit satisfaction,

148
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,000
but it is not just Keith Richards.

149
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:00,690
We all have an executive and a
genius loungey and our brains.

150
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,950
The key to having more breakthroughs is
learning how to switch between the two

151
00:09:04,951 --> 00:09:05,784
modes.

152
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,930
All right?

153
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,440
That was me doing the voice work and I'm
going to pick that up as a second job

154
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,170
if I can.
Um,

155
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:25,340
that literally is what happens in your
brain when you have a breakthrough that

156
00:09:25,341 --> 00:09:27,530
is literally where you go
when you're more creative.

157
00:09:27,531 --> 00:09:29,960
I'm sure all of you have had
moments when you were on a run,

158
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,420
when you were just
spacing out during a walk,

159
00:09:32,421 --> 00:09:35,660
when you were in the shower and send
them that. You just realized something.

160
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,170
And the reason it works is
because you're executive mode.

161
00:09:39,171 --> 00:09:42,350
The part in the front of your brain that
takes care of everything that gets you

162
00:09:42,351 --> 00:09:47,050
places on time. That finishes projects.
It has to go quiet, but it can't just,

163
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:50,000
it doesn't just go quiet. If you tell it
to you, it gets annoyed if you do that.

164
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,120
So you have to fake it out.
You have to give it a goal.

165
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,970
We're going to walk to the store now,
the executives happy.

166
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,190
We're going to finish the dishes,
we're going to take a shower.

167
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,620
The executives like, great, I have
something I'm going to finish.

168
00:10:00,621 --> 00:10:04,260
Thank goodness I'm so happy.
This is the case and it sorted,

169
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:07,490
but it's kind of mindless, but you don't
have to concentrate hard on it. Judah.

170
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:12,260
Yes. If you're wondering what we mean by
if you tell the executive to go quiet,

171
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:16,400
it gets annoyed. How many of you
have tried meditation, right?

172
00:10:16,401 --> 00:10:19,610
How many of you have experienced
the monkey mind? Exactly.

173
00:10:19,611 --> 00:10:20,870
So you know what we're talking about.

174
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:24,230
That's what happens when you try to
have the consecutive to go quiet.

175
00:10:24,231 --> 00:10:26,780
You're welcome.
And so,

176
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,950
but if you give it this kind of
mindless task, what happens is power.

177
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:35,000
Literally power reroutes from the
executive and goes to this genius lounge,

178
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:39,680
this default mode network and it's like
the espresso machine gets fired up and

179
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,370
all the different parts of the network
started drinking coffee and they start

180
00:10:43,371 --> 00:10:45,440
getting jazz and the different
parts of this network,

181
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:48,290
they encompass so many various parts.

182
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,780
You have your own personal memories,

183
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,180
you have your every prediction
and your future prediction.

184
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:56,510
You have your sense of empathy trying to
figure out how somebody else's feeling.

185
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:00,050
You have your own sense of self, your met
a narrative that's moving through this.

186
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,250
You have your inferior pride or Lowe's,

187
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:06,200
which is all the physical sensation
coming into you. It goes on and on.

188
00:11:06,201 --> 00:11:11,150
The sheer number of things
that this network is engaged
in and what it does when

189
00:11:11,151 --> 00:11:14,660
you're on some sort of random little
task is it starts mixing and matching

190
00:11:14,661 --> 00:11:15,494
information.

191
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,460
It starts playing around is if you had a
pile of Lego's and it's just making all

192
00:11:19,461 --> 00:11:21,890
these legos together and then
holding them up and saying,

193
00:11:21,891 --> 00:11:25,130
is this a brilliant idea? Is that
this is a brilliant idea. Now,

194
00:11:25,131 --> 00:11:28,520
one of the keys to this is that it's
not that the executive plays no role.

195
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:32,600
As you saw on the video, the geniuses keep
looking to the executive. They're like,

196
00:11:32,601 --> 00:11:33,500
hey,
we came up with this.

197
00:11:33,501 --> 00:11:37,610
What do you think the executive
is actually saying yes or no?

198
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,420
And so at some point you're geniuses
come up with something really good,

199
00:11:41,421 --> 00:11:45,380
your executive says yes and that's when
it enters your level of awareness that

200
00:11:45,381 --> 00:11:46,820
your Aha moment.

201
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,950
Now the science kind of stops at the
moment at how does your brain determine

202
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,290
what's a good idea and what's not a good
idea? How does it know to wake you up?

203
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,333
We don't know yet,

204
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,990
but we do know that this is
what's happening and there
are certain things that

205
00:12:01,991 --> 00:12:06,610
we all can do to capitalize
on this natural ability.

206
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,400
And the first one is plasticity.

207
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:14,440
So the reason I showed you this
video was for a very specific reason.

208
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:16,900
I'll show it to you again.
Watch the defense.

209
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:22,130
[inaudible] stands there.

210
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,860
They just look at the quarterback.

211
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:37,070
And the reason it works is because what's
happening is not within their realm of

212
00:12:38,071 --> 00:12:41,790
what's possible. They don't
notice it, they don't expect it,

213
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,580
and so they can't think of what to do.

214
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:49,590
He literally has the ball and is walking
by seven people who could tackle him at

215
00:12:49,591 --> 00:12:54,120
any moment and nobody moves
because they can't put it together.

216
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,760
That is what plasticity allows us to do.

217
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,140
Brain plasticity is our ability
to build new neural connections,

218
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,760
to understand new thoughts.
To give you an idea of what plasticity is,

219
00:13:05,761 --> 00:13:06,630
I want to show you this,

220
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:14,960
so this is a video by drew Barry who
does amazing biological animations.

221
00:13:15,241 --> 00:13:17,730
Highly recommend you go check
out his stuff, it's brilliant,

222
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:23,030
and here he's got a single neuron and
what you're watching happen is the Axon or

223
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,190
the,
I mean that the Soma or the body,

224
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:29,820
the big bulb there is what's sort
of giving out pulses of electricity.

225
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:33,270
There's new research out actually that
it's not just the body that does that,

226
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:36,480
but we don't need to get into that
right now and we're moving along to the

227
00:13:36,481 --> 00:13:37,051
dendrites.

228
00:13:37,051 --> 00:13:40,140
These are the parts of the brain that
just branch out like a river and the parts

229
00:13:40,141 --> 00:13:41,610
of the neurons and just go out.
Now,

230
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:44,100
now and along them you
have these little heads,

231
00:13:44,101 --> 00:13:46,530
these little buds and on
the top of these buds,

232
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,870
that's where you have
neurotransmitter receptors.

233
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:53,940
The places that accepted things like
Serotonin, dopamine, neuro epinephrin.

234
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:00,080
The thing you need to realize is
this is not a static situation.

235
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,080
What you're seeing right here is you're
watching a new neurotransmitter receptor

236
00:14:04,081 --> 00:14:09,081
be born for the first time and now all
of a sudden there is a new way for the

237
00:14:10,561 --> 00:14:14,370
neurons to connect to one another and
because there's a new way for them to

238
00:14:14,371 --> 00:14:15,360
connect to one another,

239
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:20,430
there's a new thought that can happen
because that's one of the most important

240
00:14:20,431 --> 00:14:23,400
things for you to understand.
Your thoughts are not chemical,

241
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,210
your thoughts are not electrical,
your thoughts or structural.

242
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:33,080
Your brain is literally building
new neurotransmitter receptors every

243
00:14:33,311 --> 00:14:38,311
millisecond and in doing that you have
the ability to build new connections and

244
00:14:38,891 --> 00:14:42,280
having the ability to build
new connections gives you
the ability to have a new

245
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:43,114
thought.

246
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:49,510
Basically Messenger RNA sends a message
to transfer RNA. This is transfer RNA.

247
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:53,300
Look at the very top, you see
the ACC, those are amino acids,

248
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,050
this little factory stacks, amino
acids, one on top of the other.

249
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,780
And then when it's done it cuts them off.

250
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,990
And then this amazing
magical thing happens.

251
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,190
The protein folds show.

252
00:15:05,191 --> 00:15:08,900
You've heard of this in this case
and what we're talking about,

253
00:15:08,901 --> 00:15:12,260
these proteins fold and form
new neurotransmitter receptors.

254
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,580
So it's our ability to do that.
That makes us plastic.

255
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,880
Your brain is structural.

256
00:15:20,881 --> 00:15:24,960
You're building the actual
infrastructure to have a new thought.

257
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,830
And so one of the first things that you
all have to get better at that everyone

258
00:15:28,831 --> 00:15:31,860
has to get better at is getting
more practiced at doing this.

259
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,520
So people who tell themselves, I'm not
creative, I don't think of these things,

260
00:15:35,521 --> 00:15:40,230
I'm not that sort of person that is
equivalent to sitting on the couch for two

261
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:44,160
years. And then somebody tells you to do
10 pushups and you can't. And you say,

262
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:49,140
I guess I'm just weak now. I'm just
forever out of shape. It's hopeless now,

263
00:15:49,141 --> 00:15:52,770
you know, that's not the case. You know,
you just need to work out and get fit.

264
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:57,510
The same is true about your own ability
to have a breakthrough about your own

265
00:15:57,511 --> 00:16:01,920
ability to be creative.
We have become neuro couch potatoes.

266
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,800
We do the same things over and over.

267
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,570
And when we do the same
things over and over,

268
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:10,800
we don't challenge our brains to
build new neurotransmitter receptors,

269
00:16:10,801 --> 00:16:14,400
which means we can't build a new thought.
And that's why we get stuck.

270
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,070
That's why many of us end up
like the defense on that team.

271
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,890
Something new has happened
and we can't process it.

272
00:16:19,891 --> 00:16:21,900
We don't know what it
is and it walks by us.

273
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:27,030
This is what it's like when
you lack neuroplasticity,

274
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:31,170
but you're trying to come up with a new
thought and there are tools that can

275
00:16:31,171 --> 00:16:33,390
help you actually get to
something that's more like this.

276
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,420
And so that's what this is
really about is the tools.

277
00:16:36,421 --> 00:16:40,950
It's about changing your neurons from
this to this. You want all those branches,

278
00:16:40,951 --> 00:16:43,620
you want all that connectivity.
That's what you're looking for.

279
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,380
What do you think this is?

280
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,040
Okay.

281
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,950
Don't be shy. You have no way of
knowing. So there's shout stuff out.

282
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,350
Paint
fabric.

283
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,713
Okay.

284
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,810
See that, feel that push, feel that push.

285
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:11,400
That's like trying to do a pushup
when you're out of shape, smoke

286
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:14,220
colored liquid

287
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:22,690
turbulence. What was it? Mold.

288
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:31,280
So this is ink drops in water
and you were getting there.

289
00:17:31,281 --> 00:17:32,870
You are all in and around it,

290
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,810
but now that I've told you
it's inked drops in water,

291
00:17:35,811 --> 00:17:39,710
you're looking at it again and your
brain is actually forming a new set of

292
00:17:39,711 --> 00:17:42,590
neural connections to
make that into a memory,

293
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:47,750
to understand that that's what that is.
You've broken open into a new space,

294
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:53,780
exposing ourselves to things we don't
know to things we don't understand the

295
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:54,740
things we don't see a lot.

296
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:58,460
That is literally one of the greatest
ways to create neuroplasticity.

297
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:03,410
This is one of our favorites.
Eric wine and Meyer,

298
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,650
eh? Okay, you let it go.

299
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,780
He has climbed the seven tiles
mountains on all seven continents.

300
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:15,620
There's just one funny thing is if
that weren't enough, he's blind.

301
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:20,280
So how does he do this?
How does he possibly climb this mountain?

302
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,060
Something called the brain port.
See this little thing.

303
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,860
He puts that on his tongue.

304
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,790
It is connected to these glasses
where you see a camera on the front.

305
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:35,940
The camera takes in the light signals
and it becomes electrical impulses that

306
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,620
are signaled to his tongue.

307
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:43,060
The tongue signals those into his brain
because the person who invented this

308
00:18:43,061 --> 00:18:46,270
Paul backer, Eda said, we
don't see with our eyes.

309
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,080
We see with our brains are,
I just happened to take in the light,

310
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,600
but if we can figure out another
way to take in the light signals,

311
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,810
our brains will figure out a way to
see because our brains are so plastic

312
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,860
because we can create so many
new connections and little
by little he learned to

313
00:18:59,861 --> 00:19:04,861
read the signals from his tongue and he
could actually start to see even though

314
00:19:05,021 --> 00:19:06,670
there was nothing coming through his eyes.

315
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:10,870
Another story we love as a young
woman in China, 24 years old,

316
00:19:10,871 --> 00:19:14,050
walks into the hospital kind of
dizzy. They do a, they do a cat scan.

317
00:19:14,051 --> 00:19:17,440
She has no cerebellum.
She was born without one.

318
00:19:17,441 --> 00:19:18,700
It was full of liquid in her head.

319
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,660
She shouldn't have been able to ever
walk much less hold down a job function,

320
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:26,830
but the other parts of her brain started
to take on these other abilities are

321
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,280
our ability to be plastic is almost
never ending. It's astounding.

322
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:34,330
We just need to actually work the muscle
and it's incredibly important that we

323
00:19:34,331 --> 00:19:38,420
work the muscle number of things
that we like to suggest, uh,

324
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,830
come to work one day dressed completely
differently than you ever do.

325
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:47,230
If your address down sort of person
like I am where a suit and a tie fancy

326
00:19:47,231 --> 00:19:49,090
shoes,
first of all,

327
00:19:49,091 --> 00:19:52,570
the fabric will move against
you differently and it will
give different physical

328
00:19:52,571 --> 00:19:55,450
impulses to your brain, which goes
right into your default network.

329
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,510
The other thing that will happen is
people will respond to you differently.

330
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,990
You're going to get a whole different
set of information from people as they

331
00:20:01,991 --> 00:20:04,780
react in these different
ways and you're going to,

332
00:20:04,781 --> 00:20:06,940
you're just going to take this all in.
If you're,

333
00:20:06,941 --> 00:20:09,280
if you're a woman and you tend
to wear heels and dresses,

334
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,940
wear pants and a pair of sneakers or
vice versa on both the men and the women.

335
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:14,140
Just change it up.

336
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,280
Another one that I like to do is borrow
somebody else's playlist that you don't

337
00:20:18,281 --> 00:20:22,090
know what it is and just listened to it
for the day. Just the songs that come up,

338
00:20:22,091 --> 00:20:24,820
the way they make you feel,
what you're experiencing with it.

339
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,420
We'd like to talk about eating things you
are narrowly never eat will then cause

340
00:20:28,421 --> 00:20:32,380
the brain signals are new. You have to
sort of process what is this new thing.

341
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:36,610
This one is really difficult, especially
given the political situation right now,

342
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:40,120
but read political magazines
you ordinarily wouldn't read.

343
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,720
Listen to talk radio you ordinarily
wouldn't talk to it might not be worth it

344
00:20:43,721 --> 00:20:47,050
from the stress level and we
understand that, but it's another way.

345
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:51,100
Just taking a totally
different information or
watch movies you would never

346
00:20:51,101 --> 00:20:54,310
watch.
Read a book you would never read.

347
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:58,000
Get into a conversation with someone you'd
never get into a conversation too and

348
00:20:58,001 --> 00:21:02,200
just take in things that are brand new.
When you go to home tonight,

349
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:06,580
take a completely different route if
you can and just notice what's new.

350
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:10,330
Notice what's different.
Change up your routine.

351
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,550
Routine is the death of plasticity.

352
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,580
You're wanting to just change
it up and see what's going on.

353
00:21:15,581 --> 00:21:17,830
See what you can bring in that's new,
right?

354
00:21:17,831 --> 00:21:22,150
I suggest all of you go and visit
Olivia if you can and hang out with her

355
00:21:22,151 --> 00:21:26,410
chickens and her bs because you probably
don't do that very often and watching

356
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:28,360
chickens is actually kind of fascinating.

357
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,970
They call it chicken TV
and you can just wash them,

358
00:21:30,971 --> 00:21:33,940
but they behave in a way you just
don't notice. You just don't see.

359
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:37,300
This is one of the reasons you feel more
alive when you go on vacation because

360
00:21:37,301 --> 00:21:40,090
everything's new and it's popping
in your brain. When you're,

361
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,100
when the plasticity is going,
you feel it.

362
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,800
It fundamentally feels
good and feels different.

363
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:51,040
Another piece about this is new
information you want to take in.

364
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:55,060
Things you ordinarily
would never hear about,

365
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,870
would never see,
would never do so.

366
00:21:58,871 --> 00:22:02,350
Try a sport you've never tried.
If you're more physically oriented,

367
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:07,000
ride a dirt bike, go mountain
biking in Moab, gone a trap. Ps,

368
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,520
be careful. I won't hurt myself
terribly on a chat piece,

369
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:13,810
but take in all of these different pieces
because the physical reality that you

370
00:22:13,811 --> 00:22:17,650
engage in is going straight into your
default network and it's causing all kinds

371
00:22:17,651 --> 00:22:18,580
of new things to pop.

372
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:22,510
But one of the reasons new information
is so incredibly important is because

373
00:22:22,511 --> 00:22:26,260
there's this other element to the
way that our default network works,

374
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:29,650
and we couldn't get into it
in the animation because it
was a little too complex.

375
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,100
But here's what happens right now.
You're paying attention to me,

376
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,780
or at least I hope you're
paying attention to me,

377
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:39,550
and you're creating memories in your
brain and what your hippocampus does,

378
00:22:39,551 --> 00:22:41,230
which is what's in charge
of creating your memories,

379
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:45,670
is it takes all this information and it
kind of puts it on a shelf and it waits

380
00:22:45,671 --> 00:22:50,410
to encode it as longer term memories.
And then when you're off task,

381
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,130
when you're not really focused, your
hippocampus starts to form these memories.

382
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:58,130
Meanwhile, you're off task. So your
default network is also activated.

383
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:02,380
All of a sudden your hippocampus
does a very strange thing.

384
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:07,470
It takes random shards and combinations
of these new memories and it throws them

385
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,630
like little sparks into
your default network.

386
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,910
So your default network
has all this information,

387
00:23:12,911 --> 00:23:16,780
kind of like building a fire and then
your hippocampus throws a new information

388
00:23:16,781 --> 00:23:21,430
in as a spark to light it.
So if you don't have new information,

389
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:25,030
your default network, your Genius Lounge
just keeps spinning on the same stuff.

390
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,400
It can't really bus due to something new.

391
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:31,660
This is one of the reasons very often
people who have breakthroughs do their

392
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:33,760
work and then also have
some kind of hobby,

393
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:38,140
they have something else they're really
interested in because that brings in the

394
00:23:38,141 --> 00:23:42,520
new information that starts getting
things to bang into each other in new and

395
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:47,240
novel ways, in ways they weren't
expecting. So if all you do is work,

396
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,470
it's going to be that much harder to have
that creative breakthrough because you

397
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:56,270
want to bring that new information and
from somewhere else, from something else,

398
00:23:56,271 --> 00:23:58,220
something that's just different.

399
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:04,640
So how do you access it?
How do you actually get into this mode?

400
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:06,820
She didn't take it. And
Stephanie, for instance, um,

401
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,740
one of the ways that we like to explain
the importance of plasticity is, um,

402
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:13,520
if you look at a,
at a martial artists,

403
00:24:13,521 --> 00:24:18,150
so say someone who's doing an actual
useful martial arts like Brazilian Jiu

404
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:21,750
Jitsu and knots and sissy
practice like karate. Um,

405
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:24,930
you know that once I'm slightly biased,

406
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,600
you know that there's one thing
that is the actual techniques.

407
00:24:27,601 --> 00:24:30,780
What are the moves, how can you roll?
And then something completely different,

408
00:24:30,781 --> 00:24:34,800
which is the physical conditioning
plasticity is like doing cardio. Um,

409
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:39,690
the plasticity on its own won't,
isn't necessarily the exact,

410
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,720
the exercise for plasticity isn't
necessarily the one that will lead you to

411
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,573
breakthrough.

412
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:48,980
Just like having a lot more physical
power won't necessarily get you to win on

413
00:24:50,341 --> 00:24:51,174
the Mat.

414
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:55,740
I was regularly tied into
knots by my Sensei who was
a shrimp was about this big,

415
00:24:55,741 --> 00:24:59,730
right? He could take on and
85 kilo guy without a problem.

416
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:05,780
But it's part of what will make
you better at the final result.

417
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:13,800
So the same way you do cardio
it regardless of which,

418
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,110
regardless of of which end
sport you're going to do,

419
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:21,380
you want to get better plasticity cause
it's a good conditioning to then use the

420
00:25:22,141 --> 00:25:26,940
breakthrough tools. Am I making
any sense? Yeah, please, please,

421
00:25:26,941 --> 00:25:31,280
please jump in, ask questions if
you have objections raised them. Um,

422
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:34,290
we really encouraged the
debate in the moment.

423
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,950
There might or might not be a Qa period
at the end. So take advantage of it.

424
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:41,430
All yours
objections.

425
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:50,100
So the question was what are good
contrasts in terms of your work versus a

426
00:25:50,561 --> 00:25:51,394
hobby?

427
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:55,750
What are good ways to create
that differentiation so
that you get the most out

428
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:58,780
of the new information
to get the novel ideas?

429
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,320
And so there are two things
going on in your question.

430
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:05,650
Some of the things you suggested go to
what we have up here, which is accessing,

431
00:26:05,651 --> 00:26:10,510
so sleep, walking. These are less hobbies.
I like to think of sleep as a hobby.

432
00:26:10,511 --> 00:26:11,344
That's a great idea.

433
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:16,630
But these are less hobbies and they're
more ways to access your network their

434
00:26:16,631 --> 00:26:21,310
way. There are doorways into that sort
of mindless state where you're sort of

435
00:26:21,311 --> 00:26:23,920
floating and you're not paying
too much attention to anything.

436
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:26,830
Then there's an actual
hobby where you are focused.

437
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:31,390
So actual hobbies can be anything.
Woodworking is great.

438
00:26:31,391 --> 00:26:35,710
Watching movies is great. Or reading
books, cooking, rock climbing,

439
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:39,880
cycling, it doesn't really
matter. Collecting stamps. Yes,

440
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,010
I have an objection. Um, personally
I've always found, uh, things

441
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:48,060
that'll wordless are better for
the mind wandering. So for example,

442
00:26:48,061 --> 00:26:51,030
when you watch a movie, even if it's
a movie that you know really well,

443
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:54,660
the verbal center processing center
of your brain is still active.

444
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:57,930
Whereas if you're rock climbing, if
you're bullish, you're beekeeping,

445
00:26:57,931 --> 00:27:01,080
you're usually braiding yourself for
the many mistakes you've just done.

446
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:04,740
But if you're climbing,
if you're running without music,

447
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,090
okay,

448
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:10,470
in my experience that just works better
because of the lack of a distraction

449
00:27:10,471 --> 00:27:11,760
from the verbal processor.

450
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:17,410
And, and just to be clear, there's
no absolute answers to these things.

451
00:27:17,411 --> 00:27:20,480
You find your own way. Um,
cause I would turn around so I,

452
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,660
my mind will wander very
often when I'm reading.

453
00:27:22,661 --> 00:27:24,880
You ever read the same paragraph over
and over and then you're like, oh,

454
00:27:24,881 --> 00:27:27,610
I keep reading the same paragraph.
It's cause you've mind wandered.

455
00:27:27,611 --> 00:27:31,870
So for some people, absolutely the verbal
processor completely gets in the way.

456
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,570
For other people it just
sorta it can shut down.

457
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:39,130
So you're just looking for what works for
you and what interests you because you

458
00:27:39,131 --> 00:27:43,080
don't want it to be a force. You want it
to be something that you actually liked.

459
00:27:43,081 --> 00:27:47,440
But the, the key is to give it time,
give yourself time to truly do it,

460
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:51,760
give yourself time to truly learn about
it because that's going to create new

461
00:27:51,761 --> 00:27:56,140
and different information that can then
combine with the work you're doing to

462
00:27:56,141 --> 00:28:00,720
show you novel new possibilities. Does
that make sense? It does. Thank you.

463
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:04,750
You got it. And so to
continue, Oh yes, please.

464
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:09,940
What does meditation fit into all
of those? The meditation question.

465
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,540
Excellent question.
Um,

466
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,930
I'll start and then new
debated in the book.

467
00:28:16,931 --> 00:28:20,800
Just how deep to get into this because
it seems like there are some dark sides

468
00:28:20,801 --> 00:28:25,630
to many practices have a medic
meditation. And so, so meditation,

469
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,550
ironically, you would think meditation
would put you into that kind of state.

470
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:34,300
However, the majority of meditation
practice is actually quiet.

471
00:28:34,301 --> 00:28:37,370
Your default network,
they actually make it happen.

472
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:41,620
The less one of the reasons is because
there's a part of your default network

473
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:44,440
that is all about your Meta awareness.

474
00:28:44,441 --> 00:28:46,210
So it's all about what
do I think about myself?

475
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,690
You ever get caught in a loop thinking
bad thoughts about yourself that your

476
00:28:49,691 --> 00:28:51,970
default network,
this is one of the regions.

477
00:28:51,971 --> 00:28:55,540
Depression and creativity get connected
very often cause it's the same network

478
00:28:55,541 --> 00:28:57,220
in your brain responsible for both.

479
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:02,020
So in meditation quiets that network,
it can help you with depression.

480
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:05,140
So at the same time,

481
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,370
caveat warning,
at the same time,

482
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:14,920
the default network gets strengthened
when you're in a meditative state.

483
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,670
Literally your gray matter chickens,
oh, that's not where I'm going.

484
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,020
Where were you going

485
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:25,840
please? Judah and I have
slightly different, um,

486
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,960
approaches to, well actually a
lot of things, but meditation,

487
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:33,520
I'm the ruthlessly pragmatic
one in, um, in this duo.

488
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:36,990
So the way I look at meditation
is really like a toolbox. Um,

489
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:40,870
or like a cheese board or something.
I'm the same way.

490
00:29:40,871 --> 00:29:44,110
You use a hammer or a
wrench for the same purpose,

491
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:48,760
the same way that personally I would
recommend using metta or Vipassana for the

492
00:29:48,761 --> 00:29:52,960
same purpose. It's, it really is the
same way where you talk about yoga,

493
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
it runs the gamut from the 180 degree
Celsius Bikram rooms to the uh,

494
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,640
you know, hold the mountain pose
for three days kind of things.

495
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:07,030
Meditation for me is the same way.
It's a toolbox.

496
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:09,640
So it really depends as to
what you're going after.

497
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,760
And you could be going for
emotional healing. You could,

498
00:30:11,761 --> 00:30:14,670
you could be going for internal insight.
Um,

499
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:17,230
the way I tend to see it,

500
00:30:17,231 --> 00:30:21,470
and there's a lot of push backs is
just one personal way of seeing it. Um,

501
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:26,700
from easiest to hardest is how much
sedatives you give your monkey mind.

502
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:29,590
So TM,

503
00:30:29,591 --> 00:30:33,550
transcendental meditation is a really
nice entry point into meditation because

504
00:30:33,551 --> 00:30:38,110
it gives you what is direct drugs
for the monkey mind, which is words.

505
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,850
So you get a mantra to repeat.

506
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:43,540
And in some traditions it's
considered sacred and personal.

507
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:45,390
In some other scientific studies,

508
00:30:45,391 --> 00:30:49,720
it seems that pretty much any sound that
you repeat can have the same effect.

509
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:50,920
Um,

510
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:55,920
but you get some thing mental to focus
on in various traditions of the passing

511
00:30:56,561 --> 00:31:01,210
of insight, you can focus on any
object of meditation, be it the,

512
00:31:01,211 --> 00:31:05,450
um, a candle. Your breath is
usually the most portable. Um,

513
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:10,240
for a lot of people,
like probably us in this room,

514
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,790
that's the nice dry,
comfortable work of the mind.

515
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:21,490
And for a lot of us it's easier.
Probably most of us in Silicon Valley,

516
00:31:21,491 --> 00:31:24,990
it's easier to work on something like
insight meditation because it's all in the

517
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:29,860
mind. It's a lot easier than the messy,
ugly, uncomfortable work of the heart,

518
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:34,900
which is the realm of, um, practices
like metta, loving kindness.

519
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:37,210
Don't lend compassion.
Please don't get into,

520
00:31:37,211 --> 00:31:39,670
don't learn until you're
damn sure you're ready.

521
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,980
You're taking on the sufferings
of the rest of the world. Um,

522
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,950
so if you want to grow your heart,
you're going to use one too.

523
00:31:45,951 --> 00:31:48,350
If you want to grow your plasticity,
you're going to want to go.

524
00:31:48,351 --> 00:31:51,010
Or another the caveat I
was going into his, um,

525
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,990
there are some forms of meditation.
Um,

526
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:58,600
I personally would not recommend to
beginners. Zen is a good example.

527
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:01,930
People have been known to go into
schizophrenia episodes on zen retreats.

528
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:07,150
Have me, if you have ever gone on a silent
retreat, please raise your hands. Okay.

529
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,640
For those of you who haven't,
please, please, please, please,

530
00:32:09,641 --> 00:32:11,320
please consider going on one.

531
00:32:11,321 --> 00:32:15,370
There are very few experience of which
I would say without the slightest.

532
00:32:15,371 --> 00:32:17,950
Second of hesitation,
it's a life changing experience.

533
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:22,480
I would say that about going on a silent
retreat. Those of you who have gone,

534
00:32:22,481 --> 00:32:26,980
has this been your experience?
Please feel free to say no if not okay.

535
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:30,460
Now that's an answer. It's really
good. I hate silent retreats,

536
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:36,300
but it's kind of like meditation
is training for your mind.

537
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:40,850
It's like going to the gym for your mind
and usually by two thirds of the way

538
00:32:40,851 --> 00:32:41,960
into a meditation retreat,

539
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:45,740
you are certain that you are failing the
meditation practices failing this whole

540
00:32:45,741 --> 00:32:47,600
idea stupid and you
want to go home anyway.

541
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:51,560
And there's a certain arc that you
will see your own mind go through.

542
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:57,460
The caveat that I was going into is that
meditation can in certain circumstances

543
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:02,840
help you through depression. It can
also precipitate depression. Um,

544
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,910
so as with any other tool,

545
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:10,160
it's useful to have good mentors,
teachers,

546
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:13,250
or they can be in the form of
books. Humans, it doesn't matter,

547
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:17,120
but who can guide you along the way so
you get sure that you don't get stuck

548
00:33:17,121 --> 00:33:21,080
into a vicious cycle that through
meditation can actually worsen depression.

549
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:25,910
Am I making sense? Does anyone have any
questions? Comments? Objections, please?

550
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:32,360
Okay.

551
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,970
Yeah. Meditation can in some
cases worse than depression,

552
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:39,260
especially if you're on retreat. Yes.
But it can also get two out of it.

553
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,450
It can also get you out of it.
There's a fantastic, if you,

554
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:46,340
if it gets you into it and
then gets you out of it,

555
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,790
that bones is the nicely.

556
00:33:48,791 --> 00:33:53,600
So here you're saying it's an it as
if it were a single thing. It's not,

557
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,370
you've got first a bazillion different
traditions of meditation and each

558
00:33:58,371 --> 00:34:00,620
experience we haven't, it's
going to be different. Um,

559
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:03,080
there is a book that I recommend
very, very, very highly.

560
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:05,480
It's called the mindful
way through depression.

561
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
It is one of the best books
I've seen on those two things.

562
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,720
But there's um,
if you're just starting to meditation,

563
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:16,640
get out of your mind and into your life,

564
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:21,620
but the classic favoritist would
be wherever you go. There you are.

565
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:25,880
And those are all really
good introductions as to
seeing where your mind can

566
00:34:25,881 --> 00:34:30,290
take you and learning
to drop below the mind.

567
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,500
Learning to just because something is
in your head doesn't mean it has any

568
00:34:33,501 --> 00:34:35,060
validity whatsoever.

569
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:37,833
Yeah.

570
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,750
Okay. All yours. Okay.

571
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,510
One last thing I got there I
was just saying is that it,

572
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:50,140
it has been shown to
increase the gray matter,

573
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:54,160
matter in your default network
and increase the connections.

574
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,330
And so what can happen is,

575
00:34:55,331 --> 00:35:00,280
even though you may not go into a mind
wandering state of creativity while in

576
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:02,770
the meditative state,
when you come out,

577
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,370
you're kind of charged and
ready to be stronger with it.

578
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,830
Talk about the guy or vacation,
it makes you smarter. Sorry,

579
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:12,190
talk about the guy ratification and
it makes you stronger and smarter.

580
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:16,370
It increases the folds in certain
parts of your gray matter. And, um,

581
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:19,470
I pronounce the gamification.
You might not as what threw me off,

582
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,960
it doesn't matter. Go, we
have slight differences in
pronunciation as he gets it.

583
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,740
Um,
and the,

584
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:28,990
then the complexity of the folding in
that part of your brain is directly

585
00:35:28,991 --> 00:35:33,340
related to your, uh, rapidity
in processing information.

586
00:35:33,341 --> 00:35:36,250
So it literally can make you smarter.
You're gonna explain it a lot better.

587
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:38,040
Sound good.
Um,

588
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:42,330
and so the more you're, the more your
neurons are closer to each other,

589
00:35:42,331 --> 00:35:43,530
the more they're wrapped
around each other.

590
00:35:43,531 --> 00:35:47,010
More surface area they can
get into contact with kind
of the way your genes are

591
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:50,400
wrapped up in a ball, the more chances
there are for the new connections.

592
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:54,870
So that's why it can improve what's going
on. Again, your brain is structural,

593
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:59,250
so as you, as you strengthen
the structure of your brain,

594
00:35:59,251 --> 00:36:03,690
you strengthen your ability to have
these breakthroughs. And so medic, well,

595
00:36:03,691 --> 00:36:07,650
meditation is or narrowly not an access
point. It's a strengthening point.

596
00:36:07,651 --> 00:36:09,390
So it's a plasticity strengthening point.

597
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:13,500
The access points are
things like taking naps.

598
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,070
Salvador Dali discovered the power of
the hypnagogic state when you're just

599
00:36:17,071 --> 00:36:21,480
falling asleep and you're in that liminal
in between space and other people have

600
00:36:21,481 --> 00:36:24,240
discovered the hypnopompic, which is
when you're just coming out of it,

601
00:36:24,241 --> 00:36:25,710
you know when somebody says sleep on it,

602
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:28,080
that's a real thing because
when you go to sleep,

603
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:31,380
your default network starts working on
things and right as you're waking up it

604
00:36:31,381 --> 00:36:32,760
tends to tell you things.

605
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,820
And so in the book we talked about Adam
shy or who's one of the cofounders,

606
00:36:35,821 --> 00:36:39,900
a Siri, and this is just a general
practice of his, he goes to sleep,

607
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:44,840
focuses on an idea specific problem he
has and that's using his executive to

608
00:36:44,841 --> 00:36:46,530
site.
This is what we're working on.

609
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:50,460
And then he just allows us default
network to do its thing in at night.

610
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:53,250
And then when he wakes up, he kind of
checks in. He's like, what did it tell me?

611
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:56,760
And it usually told him something.
He writes it down, he then gets up,

612
00:36:56,761 --> 00:37:00,750
goes to his desk, goes back
to his executive network
and starts working it out.

613
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:02,970
And you see this happen all the time.

614
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:07,971
Einstein famously went to his friend one
day after 10 years in 1905 working on

615
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,370
his theories about light and some
alternating and time. And he's like,

616
00:37:11,371 --> 00:37:12,570
you know what, I give up. I'm done.

617
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:16,680
And he went home and he went to
sleep and he wakes up and Voila,

618
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:19,830
he comes back to see his friend. He's
like, I have it. Thank you so much.

619
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:22,170
But here's the thing about breakthroughs.
That was in it.

620
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:26,910
He then spent six weeks with his
executive function, writing it all out,

621
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,120
getting it all straight,
so there's this constant back and forth.

622
00:37:30,121 --> 00:37:32,670
This is interplay between the two.

623
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:36,060
That is so important and so
when you access this mode,

624
00:37:36,061 --> 00:37:39,450
you have to also remember to use your
executive to focus you on the issue at

625
00:37:39,451 --> 00:37:42,270
hand to say, okay, this is
what I want to think about.

626
00:37:42,271 --> 00:37:44,760
This is what I'm going to do now.
I'm going to go take a walk.

627
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,490
Now I'm going to go take a nap.
Now I'm going to go for a swim.

628
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,910
Now I'm just going to sit in this hammock
and let myself just sort of wander off.

629
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,770
I'm going to pick up this book,
but I'm not going to be,

630
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:55,260
I'm not going to be focused
on like finishing the chapter.

631
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:59,040
I'm just going to let myself read the
book and see if I kind of wander off,

632
00:37:59,041 --> 00:38:02,700
see if something just comes out of it.
Or if you're very good at meditating,

633
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:07,800
sit down for a 10 2030 minutes, sit.
And then when you come out of it say,

634
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,350
I now want to think about this.
Go for a walk.

635
00:38:10,351 --> 00:38:14,190
Cause you've just sort of done an awesome
workout for your default network and

636
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:15,900
it's sort of primed and ready to go.

637
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,350
And then you have to let go and
let it sort of do its thing.

638
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:24,210
One of the issues with accessing it
is because of the world we live in.

639
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,290
We live in a world where we
are on task all the time.

640
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,920
And one of the interesting things is
Douglas Rushkoff and author has this

641
00:38:31,921 --> 00:38:35,130
fascinating concept where he said,
we have all this technology,

642
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,330
all these machines and yet
we're busier than ever.

643
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:42,090
Weren't they supposed to make our lives
easier? Why is this? And his theory is,

644
00:38:42,091 --> 00:38:44,710
is that we have internalized machine time.

645
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:49,930
We actually operate at the pace and rate
of the machines that are supposed to be

646
00:38:49,931 --> 00:38:53,230
helping us. And so we answer
emails at all times of the night.

647
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:56,290
We answer phone calls
whenever we're on constantly.

648
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:00,850
And the problem with being on constantly
is you never access your default mode.

649
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:03,280
You never accessed the genius lounge,

650
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:07,690
and therefore you never give yourself
the chance to have the brilliant ideas to

651
00:39:07,691 --> 00:39:08,920
have the great breakthrough.

652
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,340
The interesting thing is that
to have a true breakthrough,

653
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:16,990
we need to pull back and step into
human time. We need to slow down,

654
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:21,250
we need to allow that pace to happen.
We operate better.

655
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:26,050
When we do that, we just forget, get
overwhelmed and then go, go, go, go, go.

656
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,790
And it's not helpful.

657
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:33,750
So part of the challenge with accessing
this is allowing yourself to slow down,

658
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:39,690
is allowing yourself to re enter human
time to do things like walk and nap and

659
00:39:41,471 --> 00:39:43,660
rest.
Aw,

660
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:48,190
the experience of art is a wonderful
way to access your network.

661
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,570
You just look up at a picture like this
and the sheer immensity of it all and

662
00:39:52,571 --> 00:39:56,170
how small we are. And we are aware
of something larger than ourselves.

663
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:58,180
And the research shows,
we just,

664
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:02,170
we open up into a whole different space
and we open up our brains into a whole

665
00:40:02,171 --> 00:40:05,410
different space and different
connections occur, different,

666
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:09,040
different parts of our brains start
talking and we just were open to this and

667
00:40:09,041 --> 00:40:11,080
this also makes us slow down.

668
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:15,340
You ever see anybody just like running
along the rim of the Grand Canyon when

669
00:40:15,341 --> 00:40:17,830
you come upon something that produces all,
you slow down.

670
00:40:17,831 --> 00:40:19,240
When you walk up to a redwood,

671
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:23,560
you slowed down and you just
kind of sit there and say,

672
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,010
my God,
you don't even have to believe in God.

673
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:31,570
And that kind of comes out of your math
because we're just aware of this larger

674
00:40:31,571 --> 00:40:35,470
entity in the universe.
And so go and look out.

675
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,420
Even just looking at across the bay,

676
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:42,700
we'll do this or look out at the ocean
or go up to the top of Mount Tam and just

677
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:47,050
that just luck.
The grand vistas will ignite this in us.

678
00:40:47,051 --> 00:40:48,370
We'll bring it out of us.

679
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:55,690
I want to talk a little bit
about constraints and the
concept of Wabi Sabi cause

680
00:40:55,691 --> 00:40:58,870
constraints can be incredibly helpful
when it comes to accessing the sort of

681
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,070
breakthrough ability.

682
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:04,180
Wabi Sabi is this Japanese design
concepts where you start with the flaw,

683
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:07,180
the flaws, you're your zero
point and you integrate it.

684
00:41:07,181 --> 00:41:09,880
The flaws not to be gotten rid
of the flaws, not a problem.

685
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,840
The flaw actually directs the way
in which you're going to design.

686
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,480
And I love what street artists
do with this stuff, right?

687
00:41:16,481 --> 00:41:21,481
So a crack in the wall becomes Spider
Mans Web and a railing becomes fun for

688
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:26,140
Calvin and Hobbes and this
guy is breaking out of jail.

689
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,410
And this one,
they've turned the,

690
00:41:29,411 --> 00:41:32,970
the breaking down of the plaster on the
outside wall into a factory and it's a

691
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,690
coming out of the smokestack.
This kid's having a good time.

692
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:42,580
And here we've got camels making their
way in a caravan and all of this is from,

693
00:41:42,621 --> 00:41:44,690
they saw a floss,
something was wrong.

694
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,470
And then they use that to define how
they were going to create the art.

695
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:51,230
And so the question becomes,
what's the flaw in your system?

696
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:54,800
What's your biggest obstacle?
If you start from that point and not say,

697
00:41:54,801 --> 00:41:58,340
how do I get rid of it?
But say how is this my start point?

698
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,690
It creates all kinds of creative
abilities, creative capacities.

699
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:06,680
The flaw acts as sort of the access
point into your default network.

700
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,630
And so one way you can do this,

701
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:11,960
and you can do this with teams as
well as you build a constraint box.

702
00:42:11,961 --> 00:42:13,280
And we have found this
to be really useful.

703
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:16,370
We did this with Genentech a little bit
ago and it was very helpful because they

704
00:42:16,371 --> 00:42:18,920
were talking about how annoying
the federal regulations were.

705
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,080
So we spun it around and we were like,

706
00:42:21,081 --> 00:42:22,550
well let's talk about
what are the constraints?

707
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:24,920
And what you do is you start to
lay out the constraints, right?

708
00:42:24,921 --> 00:42:28,670
Dave is a serious problem for me.
So as the FDA,

709
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:32,750
so is the cash flow and it's really
not sexy. What we're talking about,

710
00:42:32,751 --> 00:42:34,400
it's gonna be hard to get
anybody interested in it.

711
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:37,160
So these are some of your constraints
and you just get a sense of them.

712
00:42:37,161 --> 00:42:38,870
You lay them out so they
don't get overwhelming.

713
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,140
The next thing you do is you start talking
about your assumptions because very

714
00:42:42,141 --> 00:42:45,260
often you're assuming things that
aren't right that aren't true,

715
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:47,030
and if you don't write
them down and look at them,

716
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:51,230
they're just going to stymie you the
whole way. So no one's going to listen.

717
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:56,360
Angela hates this idea 18 months to
see results. It's cost prohibitive.

718
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,800
You just lay it all out there.

719
00:42:57,801 --> 00:42:59,990
You look at it and you
question all these assumptions.

720
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:04,090
Are they really constraints or are they
just things that you've assumed their

721
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,390
conversations you haven't had?

722
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,930
And the reason you do it in this form
is because what happens in the end is it

723
00:43:08,931 --> 00:43:11,750
this becomes your solution space.

724
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:14,720
You've now defined where you can be free.

725
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:18,500
You've defined the space where your
default network can now try any number of

726
00:43:18,501 --> 00:43:22,460
things. So as opposed to these things
hemming you in and locking you in,

727
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:23,990
they turn around and free you

728
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:28,220
because now you know that you don't
have to bother looking at those things.

729
00:43:28,221 --> 00:43:30,020
You don't have to bother
beating your head against them.

730
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:32,840
And now you've got this
space that's opened up.

731
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:38,100
And that freedom is what
allows the default network
to start to truly function.

732
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:40,920
And so especially when
you do this with a team,

733
00:43:40,921 --> 00:43:43,800
it's amazing what comes out
and why you start finding out.

734
00:43:43,801 --> 00:43:46,380
But there are all these assumptions on
the table that have stopped people from

735
00:43:46,381 --> 00:43:49,710
getting interested in things that
weren't even correct in the first place.

736
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:54,020
And little by little people
started realize, oh, but
you know what we can do? Oh,

737
00:43:54,021 --> 00:43:56,310
you know, we can do. And
once you're in that space,

738
00:43:56,311 --> 00:43:59,160
now your default network
is alive and functioning.

739
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:03,720
And so this is one of the
way the constraints can act
as a really powerful tool

740
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:08,100
to get you into this Roman Mars of
99% invisible, a really fun podcast.

741
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:10,920
He has a great ted talk talking
about flags and he's like,

742
00:44:10,921 --> 00:44:14,580
you should be able to draw your
flag on a three by five note card.

743
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,910
And everybody thinks it's
ridiculous and crazy. But he's like,

744
00:44:17,911 --> 00:44:21,030
that's one of the best constraints you
can have because it's going to drive you

745
00:44:21,031 --> 00:44:24,330
to making a really excellent flag and
you can use that kind of constraint on

746
00:44:24,331 --> 00:44:26,730
anything. Can you express it
in a three by five note card?

747
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:30,600
Well then you probably don't
understand it well enough. Yes.

748
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:35,430
What do you call it? The default network.
Ah, why do I call it the default network?

749
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:39,960
I don't, I'm quoting. Um, when
you're on task and doing something,

750
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,900
it goes more quiet.
When you're off task,

751
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:47,070
your brain defaults to this network.
It just,

752
00:44:47,071 --> 00:44:48,420
this is where it goes every time.

753
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,700
So that's why it's called
the default mode network.

754
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:55,420
And one of the funny pieces is that
the person who discovered it dark,

755
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:59,790
just dark and Marcus recall to
do, okay, we'll leave it alone.

756
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:04,410
The way he figured it out was he was
noticing that when he had people in Fmr

757
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,510
eyes and told them to just
hang on a second, just wait,

758
00:45:06,511 --> 00:45:08,490
don't think about anything.
We have to do something over here.

759
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,280
All of a sudden all this activities
showed up in their brains and everyone was

760
00:45:11,281 --> 00:45:13,230
like, oh, it's just static.
It's just noise, whatever.

761
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,360
And then one day he
walks out of a meeting,

762
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:19,410
he's wandering down a hall
and it just showed up.

763
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:22,800
The idea showed up. And so what
happened was he was thinking about this,

764
00:45:22,801 --> 00:45:25,380
he was thinking about this,
and then when he was off task,

765
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,780
wandering down a hall is default network.

766
00:45:27,781 --> 00:45:31,590
The brain defaulted to it and then it
gave him an answer to a question he'd been

767
00:45:31,591 --> 00:45:36,210
asking, which is, what's up with
all this noise? And the FMA? Yes,

768
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,420
it's, it's, it's, it's because it's this,

769
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:43,650
it's this place where all these different
pieces are coming together and talking

770
00:45:43,651 --> 00:45:47,160
to each other and right. And they're
just sort of putting things together.

771
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:50,340
So we've discovered it.
It truly is the engine of our creativity.

772
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,680
That's what we've been
starting to find out.

773
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:56,100
And so these are all just ways you
can actually get into it and use it.

774
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:58,140
Focus yourself on it.
One of the things,

775
00:45:58,141 --> 00:45:59,910
and we talked about this a lot
in the beginning of the book,

776
00:45:59,911 --> 00:46:04,800
can we give a kitchen recipe for this?
Can we say one cup of butter? You know,

777
00:46:04,801 --> 00:46:09,510
two eggs, some sugar, some chocolate
chips, Vala you'll have a breakthrough.

778
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:13,470
And the answer is no, it's,
it's a nonlinear process.

779
00:46:13,471 --> 00:46:18,471
It's an emergent process and so you
have to give yourself time with it.

780
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:22,470
But what we're teaching you is that you
can actually set conditions to make it

781
00:46:22,471 --> 00:46:27,030
far more likely that it will happen.
Switching, I want to make a slight,

782
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,280
a slight switch now to
associative thinking,

783
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:32,010
which in the end is truly what
your default network is doing.

784
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:35,460
And so I'm going to show you something
that will both raise your plasticity but

785
00:46:35,461 --> 00:46:37,740
also kind of get into
associative thinking.

786
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:41,400
I'm somebody left their GoPro on the
ground and a squirrel picked it up.

787
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,233
Okay?

788
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:22,600
Okay. So I dunno about you, but
I've never seen anything like that.

789
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:26,020
That is literally a squirrels
I view of the world.

790
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:28,180
And so it does a couple of things.
One,

791
00:47:28,181 --> 00:47:31,060
it forces this growth of plasticity
because you're like, oh my God.

792
00:47:31,061 --> 00:47:33,970
It's like it's this big and it's moving
on branches you could never move on and

793
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:35,620
it's moving so quickly through the tree.

794
00:47:35,621 --> 00:47:39,070
I used to move through trees very slowly
and all of this is new and new and new

795
00:47:39,071 --> 00:47:40,720
and then at the same time it,

796
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:43,450
it adds to this piece that we
call it associative thinking,

797
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:48,160
so all the media about artificial
intelligence and how it's going to replace

798
00:47:48,161 --> 00:47:49,840
human beings and Yada Yada,
Yada.

799
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:54,520
Most people who are aware and know that
there's this big leap between where AI

800
00:47:54,521 --> 00:47:55,390
is at the moment,

801
00:47:55,391 --> 00:48:00,280
which is amazingly good at pattern
recognition and the data crunching and the

802
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:05,310
intuitive inferential leaps between ideas
and that's something that human beings

803
00:48:05,681 --> 00:48:10,681
are still particularly good at and it's
the association of the different ideas,

804
00:48:10,871 --> 00:48:14,500
what sometimes known as
abductive reasoning to have
a little bit of data here

805
00:48:14,501 --> 00:48:18,400
and then to get a whole theory out of it
here and this is what the default mode

806
00:48:18,401 --> 00:48:19,630
network gives us.

807
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:23,610
It is what takes different pieces of
data and puts them together and to whole

808
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,630
new conceptions,
whole new theories.

809
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:29,260
And so having experiences
that are completely different.

810
00:48:29,261 --> 00:48:30,880
This gets at the hobby idea,

811
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:35,440
brings in the ability to create these
associations you might not ordinarily say.

812
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:39,940
So in the same way in the 1970s
San Francisco, California,

813
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:42,340
there was a huge drought.
People drain their swimming pools,

814
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,280
they just looked like empty holes,
but a bunch of kids were like,

815
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:47,470
these are skate parks,
right?

816
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:50,200
That's something that comes up from
the default mode network or the

817
00:48:50,201 --> 00:48:53,350
skateboarding kid who wants to be
able to keep practicing in winter.

818
00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:57,250
So he creates a snowboard
and invents snowboarding,

819
00:48:57,790 --> 00:49:00,150
or the army has got Lex San,

820
00:49:00,151 --> 00:49:05,151
a hard plastic that is used in their
windshields of their helicopters and these

821
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:09,310
windshields are getting scratched up
like nobody's business and the deserts of

822
00:49:09,311 --> 00:49:13,450
Iraq and Afghanistan and in the
training at Fort or Irwin in California,

823
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:15,190
and they're spending tens
of millions of dollars.

824
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:20,190
You're placing these lexan
very scratchable windshields
and lo and behold are

825
00:49:20,621 --> 00:49:21,940
these two army reserve,

826
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,000
national reserve guardmen who are
helicopter mechanics and Nascar fans.

827
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:29,050
And like, well, you know, Nascar,

828
00:49:29,051 --> 00:49:31,270
this is the same luck San
on there and when she has,

829
00:49:31,271 --> 00:49:35,560
but they put these thin mylar sheets on
top of them before every race they're

830
00:49:35,561 --> 00:49:38,380
called tearaways. And at the end
of the race they pull them off.

831
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:41,860
The mylar took all the hits and scratches
and the windshield's fine, like,

832
00:49:41,861 --> 00:49:43,900
why don't we just put them
on the army helicopters.

833
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:45,940
They took it from one place
and moved it to another.

834
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:49,540
They associated it save the army tens
of millions of dollars because the

835
00:49:49,541 --> 00:49:52,990
windshields lifespan doubled and tripled.
But it was already there.

836
00:49:52,991 --> 00:49:55,600
They associated it,
they moved it to another realm.

837
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:59,320
And very often this is how we
end up seeing innovation happen.

838
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,870
How many of you know Thomas
Edison's electric pen?

839
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:07,870
Exactly. He's not very proud of
it either. Wasn't very successful.

840
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:11,950
Ended up in the window of a pawn shop
downtown in New York who should be walking

841
00:50:11,951 --> 00:50:13,810
by. But this guy, Samuel O'reilly,

842
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:17,620
Samuel O'reilly takes a look at it and
he's a pretty clever guy and he's like, I,

843
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:19,540
I think I could change the surround.

844
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:24,660
Samuel O'reilly invents modern
tattooing by changing the electric pen,

845
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:31,070
moving things in their context from one
context to another is very often where

846
00:50:31,071 --> 00:50:32,540
these innovative ideas come from.

847
00:50:32,541 --> 00:50:35,870
It's the association and that your
default network that's making those

848
00:50:35,871 --> 00:50:38,450
associations, that's
connecting, that's inferring,

849
00:50:38,451 --> 00:50:41,540
that's intuiting between
vastly different things.

850
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:44,803
Yeah,

851
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:50,490
so there was a young meteorologist whose
name I wrote down and I can't remember,

852
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:54,550
it's over here somewhere,
I'll get it at the end,

853
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:59,050
but he's up in the Arctic in the early
19 hundreds and something just strikes

854
00:50:59,051 --> 00:51:03,130
him that the, the ice kind of looks
like jigsaw puzzle pieces and that's it.

855
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,540
He just notices that it's
like interesting to them.

856
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:09,570
Year later he's looking at
a globe. He's like, Huh,

857
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:12,370
you got the continents kind
of look like jigsaw pieces.

858
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:14,560
I wonder if they were ever together.

859
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,880
And he goes and he checks out the rocks
along South America and along Africa and

860
00:51:18,881 --> 00:51:20,590
he checks out some of the
floor and fun and he's like,

861
00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:24,880
I think these things drifted. He invented
the concept of continental drift,

862
00:51:24,881 --> 00:51:26,590
which eventually took
us to plate tectonics.

863
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:31,330
A meteorologist making a breakthrough
in geology because I'm an association he

864
00:51:31,331 --> 00:51:36,040
made by looking at the ice in the Arctic.
This is very often how it works.

865
00:51:36,041 --> 00:51:40,180
This idea of curiosity of noticing the
way different things come together and

866
00:51:40,181 --> 00:51:44,040
it's the default network. It's mindlessly
staring out at the ice and be like, Huh.

867
00:51:44,050 --> 00:51:47,620
They look like jigsaw puzzles and then
mindlessly staring at a globe and being

868
00:51:47,621 --> 00:51:51,430
like, oh, the jigsaw puzzles kind
of remind me of the continents.

869
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:54,490
This is where these things come
together and that's what I'm saying.

870
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:58,600
It's important to allow ourselves to
be off task because we don't allow

871
00:51:58,601 --> 00:52:00,670
ourselves to access the network otherwise.

872
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:04,810
So I want you to imagine that gravity
stops working at 10:00 PM and then starts

873
00:52:04,811 --> 00:52:08,740
working again at 7:00 AM how has
our entire culture different?

874
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:10,530
Okay,

875
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:12,690
Sas drawing things out,
whatever you can come up with.

876
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:18,360
Are there nuts over every house or
houses designed more like boats where

877
00:52:18,361 --> 00:52:19,500
everything is locked down?

878
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:26,130
Our children's sort of tied to their
beds before 7:00 PM how to teenagers play

879
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:28,600
around with this? How do they rebel
given this, how do they get in trouble?

880
00:52:28,601 --> 00:52:31,930
Given this,
how do people throw nighttime parties?

881
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:33,970
What does burning man look like?

882
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:41,650
You could just keep asking yourself this
over and over again, and it seems silly,

883
00:52:41,651 --> 00:52:44,800
but really it's coming out of the
tradition of thought experiments,

884
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:49,780
which Einstein uses. All
right? Just playing out what
is possible in the universe,

885
00:52:49,781 --> 00:52:54,710
what might occur,
and one last one I'll show you.

886
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:56,720
The very end is so this,

887
00:52:58,520 --> 00:52:59,353
whoops.

888
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:03,690
Yeah, this is the world's most boring
video unless you put this music over it.

889
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:10,050
Now all of a sudden there's tension
and you're probably wondering,

890
00:53:10,051 --> 00:53:13,440
did I put a shark fin in? Is there
going, is it going to pop up?

891
00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:17,010
Are you going to see that fit? Come on,
right? Is it just the mouth going pop out?

892
00:53:17,790 --> 00:53:19,080
I don't have those skills.

893
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:22,590
This is just like the world's most boring
clouds at the window of an airplane,

894
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:27,240
but we put the music on and suddenly
your brain's creating a whole universe.

895
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:31,710
You can do this with any receipt
in the universe. All right?

896
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:36,720
I'll end the tension. You can literally
take any movie scene you want,

897
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:39,300
add music to it and watch how it changes.
Watch what happens.

898
00:53:39,301 --> 00:53:43,320
I had one group where somebody shouted
out last scene of Casablanca and somebody

899
00:53:43,321 --> 00:53:46,980
shouted out, we are the champions by
Queen, and they thought they had me.

900
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:49,290
They thought they nailed me and I
was a little nervous. I was like,

901
00:53:49,291 --> 00:53:50,220
I don't know how this is going to go.

902
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:54,510
So we go to youtube but bring up the
Casablanca, put it on mute, we bring up,

903
00:53:54,511 --> 00:53:56,520
we are the champions. Turn
it on, start the two of them.

904
00:53:56,521 --> 00:54:01,470
We start watching and it's shocking how
it starts to line up and as the plane

905
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,630
starts to take off and
else's being taken away,

906
00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:06,330
the music is crescendoing
and Freddy Mercury going,

907
00:54:06,331 --> 00:54:09,840
we the jab and you're like,
oh my God,

908
00:54:09,841 --> 00:54:14,130
it's so moving and it's totally
random and play this game.

909
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:16,980
Literally play this game
and it sounds silly,

910
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:20,940
but it's amazing how it sets you up for.

911
00:54:20,941 --> 00:54:24,090
Then being able to connect to things
you are narrowly would never think would

912
00:54:24,091 --> 00:54:28,620
work and that's where those
breakthroughs come from. So there's,

913
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:32,070
there's play involved, there's a craft
involved, there's practice involved.

914
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:35,040
There are these tools. It's, but
it's not something in theory,

915
00:54:35,041 --> 00:54:38,700
it's something you do.
It's a way you are in the world.

916
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:43,800
And so you have the ability,
you have the brain for this,

917
00:54:43,801 --> 00:54:48,690
you have all the parts for it. Everybody
does. We just have to use them,

918
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:51,660
practice with them, and get
comfortable with them. And that's,

919
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,600
that's why we wrote the
book. See, that's nicer.

920
00:54:56,110 --> 00:54:56,510
Thank you.
