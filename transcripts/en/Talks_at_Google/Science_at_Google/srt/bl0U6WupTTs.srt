1
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:06,080
Right.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,920
I'm pleased to welcome Leonard David
to our toxic Google program today.

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,180
Lennar David is an award winning space
journalist who has been reporting on

4
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,640
space activities for over 50 years.

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:21,680
He frequently contribute to the
website space.com as their space inside

6
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:26,740
columnist and as the coauthor of Buzz
Aldrin Mission to Mars in 2015 he became

7
00:00:28,131 --> 00:00:33,110
the first recipient of the American
astronautical societies Ordway award for

8
00:00:33,111 --> 00:00:37,580
sustained excellence and space flight
history and the category of journalism.

9
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,990
And in 2010 he received the
National Space Club press award.

10
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,281
Mars.

11
00:00:43,281 --> 00:00:47,180
Our Future on the Red Planet considers
the eminent settlement of humans on Mars

12
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,800
backed by extensive research.

13
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:53,270
The book says the book is part of a
Major National Geographic Mars initiative

14
00:00:53,271 --> 00:00:57,230
this fall, including the documentary
in partnership with Ron Howard.

15
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:00,620
Please join me in welcoming
Lennar David to Google today.

16
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,113
Right.

17
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,490
Well thanks so much for coming
in on your lunch break to,

18
00:01:11,491 --> 00:01:15,900
there will be pictures of tomatoes
grown on Mars, so I help you who,

19
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,730
who doesn't have lunch will
be more hunger hungry. Uh,

20
00:01:20,731 --> 00:01:22,530
I thought I'd start out with something.

21
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,980
I went to a book review from somebody
else and they were clever and reading in

22
00:01:26,981 --> 00:01:29,550
their own words,
you know,

23
00:01:29,551 --> 00:01:34,530
cause you write these and it's pretty
that first paragraph, you know,

24
00:01:34,531 --> 00:01:38,610
when you get the assignment to do one of
these books, that first one is a killer.

25
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,490
And
in the 2030s,

26
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:46,410
a peculiar shadows slips across
the Reddish Vista. That is Mars.

27
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,470
The historic arrival of the first
expeditionary crew from Earth to the Red

28
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:56,640
Planet, balances on an impulsive
mix of rocket propulsion,

29
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,700
determine will and hard earned luck,

30
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,420
outstretch landing legs of
the craft near the planet.

31
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:08,510
A powered and safe descent by humans
onto Mars is a literal trial by fire.

32
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,960
So I got done with that and played piano
for a couple of hours and let me take

33
00:02:15,781 --> 00:02:19,560
you on this trip.
I'm not going to be easy.

34
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,990
I think what I'm trying to get across,

35
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,800
it's going to be difficult and we liked
challenges and this is full of those

36
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,400
challenges.
Um,

37
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,730
I think one of the things that I'm proud
about this book is I tried to integrate

38
00:02:35,731 --> 00:02:38,010
not just technical aspects.

39
00:02:38,011 --> 00:02:42,460
I didn't want to shove a bunch of people
and habitats and give him a porthole

40
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:46,500
the lookout in a space suit and run
around out there and plant a flag salute,

41
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,550
grab rocks, come back home.
That's not what this is about.

42
00:02:50,551 --> 00:02:55,551
And this is a kind of a really important
time frame and exploration of space.

43
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:01,000
Um, the book is sort of
divided into these chapters.

44
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,863
Yeah.

45
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:11,560
And this is a concept. I, I went
through a lot of editors and I,

46
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:14,090
I tried Mars land.

47
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,850
When I got done with this book,

48
00:03:16,851 --> 00:03:20,330
I kept thinking people
kept sending me emails.

49
00:03:20,331 --> 00:03:23,630
Every picture they've seen from Mars
that looks like someplace we been,

50
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,670
either it's Utah, southwest,
maybe Iceland's, some
people have been in Iceland.

51
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,400
Um,
it's a mixture of all that.

52
00:03:31,401 --> 00:03:35,750
And I felt there was Myers land that
I wanted to project in this book.

53
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,740
And when I got the call
to write this book,

54
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:45,070
I was actually at a meeting at the
Lunar Planetary Institute and Houston,

55
00:03:45,171 --> 00:03:46,004
Texas.

56
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:51,380
They brought in hundreds of scientists
to start looking at potential landing

57
00:03:51,381 --> 00:03:52,550
zones for humans.

58
00:03:52,551 --> 00:03:57,551
The first meeting of this type
and about 50 different sites.

59
00:03:57,861 --> 00:04:01,310
On Mars became explorations zones.

60
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,320
I'll explain a little bit
more about what that is,

61
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,410
but these are the early preliminary,
uh,

62
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:11,440
sites that had been selected as potential
areas where a habitats can be first

63
00:04:11,661 --> 00:04:12,800
put down on Mars.

64
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:14,760
Okay.

65
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,290
The key to this is exploration zones.
What does it mean?

66
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:23,970
It means that the humans can go to
different places within a certain,

67
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,273
uh,

68
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:30,120
say a hundred mile circle and find
all kinds of either resources,

69
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:34,950
scientific benefit to go there.
Um, and also problems, you know,

70
00:04:34,951 --> 00:04:39,180
cause there's going to be really a lot
of mystery with Mars as much as we think

71
00:04:39,181 --> 00:04:44,030
we know about it. My guess is we
got some Aha moments coming. Um,

72
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:49,490
you're sort of the artist's
concepts of first foot fall on Mars.

73
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:54,740
You know, what kind of crew makeup
will that be? How many will be there?

74
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:59,720
Six or seven. Somebody is a laggard
and they're waiting for him to,

75
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,950
or she didn't get out of there. I
be the commander. They can, sure.

76
00:05:03,951 --> 00:05:06,800
They don't fall through the,
the dust or anything.

77
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:08,800
Okay.

78
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,633
Um,

79
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,740
one of the things about this particular
assignment for me doing the book was

80
00:05:14,741 --> 00:05:15,900
it's part of a,

81
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,920
on a companion book to a six part series
that national geographic has just on

82
00:05:21,941 --> 00:05:22,990
the edge of releasing.

83
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:28,090
The first one shows up on TV on National
Geographic Channel on November 14th.

84
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:28,810
Uh,

85
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:33,810
it's a docu drama and it has a crew and
you'll think be very much entertained

86
00:05:36,851 --> 00:05:38,160
and,
uh,

87
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:42,070
excited and also a nervous
about what happens on this,

88
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:46,720
this particular expedition
and has some surprise endings.

89
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:51,970
Uh, but it, it reflects a lot of
what the book tries to get to,

90
00:05:51,971 --> 00:05:54,640
which is a global vision.

91
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,040
How many countries are
really going to go to Mars?

92
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:01,160
You'd be surprised how many countries
have already gone to Mars through robotic

93
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:05,100
means. Right now, India has
an orbit around Mars. Uh,

94
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:09,650
Europe has a new webinar that
just started, uh, operations, uh,

95
00:06:09,651 --> 00:06:13,270
that Nasa us have several.
Uh,

96
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,060
China is going to be launching a,
a rover to Mars in 2020.

97
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:18,973
Uh,

98
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:24,050
other countries have definitely picked up
the pace about the exploration of Mars.

99
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:28,820
So I did write a lot of our
global vision. Um, again,

100
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:31,550
the Indians, uh, Chinese
right now as we speak,

101
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:36,500
we've got to Chinese astronauts
up in their space lab. Um,

102
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:41,710
you know, to me in my, my little
world of space journalism, uh,

103
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,250
China's the story to watch.

104
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:47,630
They're very aggressive and it's going
to be very fascinating to watch them grow

105
00:06:47,631 --> 00:06:48,770
in the next few years.

106
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:53,420
Lots of components of the Chinese space
program coming together pretty quickly.

107
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:59,390
European Space Agency is a key player.
Uh,

108
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:04,250
in the book I try to get to something
that's a bifurcation of exploration

109
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,750
objectives and goals.

110
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:10,220
One of them is the Europeans are very
interested in creating a moon village.

111
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,380
They're trying to bring together all
the countries that are a part of the

112
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:18,540
European Space Agency and perhaps put a,
uh,

113
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,410
a mini settlement on,
on the moon.

114
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:25,640
And there was a lot of this debate
discussion should be go to the moon,

115
00:07:25,641 --> 00:07:27,050
back to the moon first.

116
00:07:27,051 --> 00:07:31,160
Should we use the moon for fuel somehow
to make the Mars mission happen?

117
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,950
Um, I'm not going to go
into all the details of it,

118
00:07:33,951 --> 00:07:37,130
but it's pretty well laid out in
the book. It has definitely, uh, uh,

119
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:42,580
a discussion point coming up about
where other countries may go in the next

120
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,710
decade or so.
Also,

121
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:50,740
this is a picture that just happened
a few days ago where the Europeans,

122
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:55,940
a crashed landed there,
a lander and nobody was on this.

123
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,300
This is a robotic craft,
but this is,

124
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,330
gets to the point that everybody
says that all the engineers,

125
00:08:02,331 --> 00:08:06,200
and I know a lot of you are engineers,
Myers is hard and you know,

126
00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:09,260
it's really hard when you slam
into it at 200 miles an hour.

127
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,310
But they lost this arbitrary. And just
even today, this morning, one of the,

128
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:20,900
one of the orbiters around
Mars has actually got some
new images in a definitely

129
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,890
a splattered

130
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:28,580
software failure apparently.
And a story I can't write yet,

131
00:08:28,581 --> 00:08:32,600
but I think it's there.
I tar problems. You know,

132
00:08:32,601 --> 00:08:35,240
people in the United States have
problems even talking about a Europe,

133
00:08:35,241 --> 00:08:38,390
about software,
how many Ihr people are here?

134
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,250
Is there anybody who
really gets into the ITR?

135
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:45,100
I think this is what's going
to come out of this story. Um,

136
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:50,290
on a wildcard in all this is Elon Musk.
I mean, he's got this space, acts,

137
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,770
Tesla,
solar cities in Mexico a few,

138
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,160
several weeks ago now.

139
00:08:56,161 --> 00:09:01,161
He unleashed his vision of where he
believes Mars exploration is going to go.

140
00:09:02,011 --> 00:09:05,490
He's got an interplanetary
transport system he wants to build.

141
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:10,410
He definitely is. Um, I'm
getting old. I'm about 70.

142
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,170
To me,
he was like the Walt Disney,

143
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,680
a guy up there because when I was watching
tomorrow land on black and white TV

144
00:09:19,441 --> 00:09:21,390
and the 50s,
while Disney,

145
00:09:21,391 --> 00:09:25,770
you used to come out and parade out his
visions with Vern avant Braun and some

146
00:09:25,771 --> 00:09:30,540
of these other people about space
travel on Mars was the objective.

147
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,361
And so I,

148
00:09:31,361 --> 00:09:36,361
I felt like Alon touch my nerve
again because I remember Walt Disney.

149
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:38,770
Yeah.

150
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,660
This is one of his concepts.

151
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:44,700
Okay.

152
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:49,700
The thing to watch with Alon is the use
of the dragon capsule that is now in

153
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,730
use, uh, for uh,

154
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,410
hauling up cargo and eventually humans
to the international space station.

155
00:09:58,411 --> 00:10:03,411
So a line's got a pretty gutsy plan
about trying to land these robotic,

156
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,140
uh,
craft this red dragon on Mars.

157
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,400
The key to this is you see
all that stuff coming down.

158
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:14,100
It's called supersonic retropropulsion.

159
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,510
And it's like the old days in
science fiction. I mean, we,

160
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,950
that's the way we used to do it. And Psi
Phi, you don't need the big parachute.

161
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,840
He can just land and,
um,

162
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:30,150
alon is already done. And as
a space x rocket, you know,

163
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:35,151
those drone ships he has out in the
water and then he's got land a land,

164
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,810
he lands on land.

165
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,530
Those are going to supersonic
retropropulsion maneuvers.

166
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:45,890
NASA is very interested in this technology
for getting larger and larger and

167
00:10:46,171 --> 00:10:47,580
larger payloads on Mars.

168
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:51,690
So Alon is already a cutting
metal on a lot of good ideas.

169
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,940
Uh, the other thing in the book,
we got into his home base. Um,

170
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,260
I was surprised how many
analog sites around the planet,

171
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:05,480
people are going into little habitats.

172
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:09,170
This is in Hawaii
practicing Mars missions.

173
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:14,480
You see them all over the place.
There's, um, these are the,

174
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,510
the Mars want to be astronauts,
but,

175
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,530
but what they're learning things
that are thinking very practical.

176
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:26,760
One of them is this, the sociological
implications of five or six people,

177
00:11:26,761 --> 00:11:30,820
uh, sharing food and wondering
who stole the m and m's. Uh,

178
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:39,090
uh, the one aspect that I did highlight
in the book is that we're going to start

179
00:11:39,091 --> 00:11:42,930
pretty small. Uh, these
logistics flights to Mars.

180
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:47,030
You get a small lander, uh, with, uh, um,

181
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:52,440
these habitats kind of structured
this way, kind of small. Um,

182
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:57,970
but that's the beginning and this is,
this is all doable in my mind. And,

183
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:02,290
and we've already got robotic
craft on Mars that weigh a ton now,

184
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:06,400
but we got to learn how to get bigger
and bigger payloads down on the surface.

185
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:10,480
You know, here's another
expansion idea for habitats.

186
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:13,640
Okay.

187
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,090
Uh, one big, uh,

188
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:20,230
discussions coming up is should we
stay in Mars' orbit and you as teller

189
00:12:21,121 --> 00:12:25,430
robotics to actually glue the habitats
together before astronauts humans get

190
00:12:25,431 --> 00:12:26,960
there.
Um,

191
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:32,020
it's an interesting development
and telepresence and tell
a robotics and that's

192
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:34,670
moving along in a separate wavelength.
And we'll see.

193
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:37,190
I think it's going to be a
major player no matter what.

194
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,800
But there is a lot of discussion about
having an orbiter with people in it

195
00:12:42,801 --> 00:12:45,250
around Mars actually assemble,
uh,

196
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:49,790
the site that eventually humans
will go to before they get there.

197
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:55,210
So the raw robots will be
sort of be waving to the
astronauts as they climb off.

198
00:12:55,761 --> 00:12:59,600
So we'll have a pretty good review ahead
of time through robotic eyes are what

199
00:12:59,601 --> 00:13:04,400
the habitat looks like, uh, before
even humans set foot on Mars.

200
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,510
Here's tomato pictures.
So those are you still hungry?

201
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,480
This is a big issue.
You know,

202
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:16,940
we are beyond Tang.
It's the 21st century.

203
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,080
So uh, things are happening in some, uh,

204
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:24,740
biology labs and how a bad
crop growth. Uh, how much, uh,

205
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:29,540
came over your lie on crops grown on Mars.
How do we grow, what happens to them?

206
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,730
Um, what nutrients are needed. Again,

207
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:39,590
this is short about a conceptual module
with the whole greenhouse jammed in

208
00:13:39,591 --> 00:13:44,030
there. I got a feeling people are going
to be on Mars, are going to be very thin.

209
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,570
I wish I was there some days.
But anyway,

210
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,570
one of the best thing
is it's going on now.

211
00:13:53,571 --> 00:13:58,070
Some very creative three d
printing construction concepts
and this is where it's

212
00:13:58,071 --> 00:13:59,360
going to go this way.

213
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:03,320
We're not going to have tin cans
with people hunker down in there.

214
00:14:03,321 --> 00:14:06,860
I think we're going to start using the
local resources of Mars to actually use

215
00:14:06,861 --> 00:14:08,750
construction,
uh,

216
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:13,370
materials and actually build new
kind of structures on Mars. Uh,

217
00:14:13,371 --> 00:14:16,280
that makes it nicer. There's living
rooms, there's, you know, all kinds of,

218
00:14:16,281 --> 00:14:19,460
there's a TV room over
to the right side maybe,

219
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:25,790
but also Mars has got a lot of water
and a lot of ice under the surface.

220
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:30,530
And one other, the new architectural
concepts is this ice, um,

221
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:34,310
ice house on bars.
So who's to say,

222
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,040
all I know is people are
really looking at right now

223
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,470
that's from inside the ice house.

224
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:44,770
Okay.

225
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:47,620
Also caves on Mars.
We're looking for caves.

226
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:52,910
Should we go back to cave living?
That wasn't it.

227
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:57,440
I didn't get down to that, but that's,
that's a circle there for a writer.

228
00:14:57,441 --> 00:14:58,820
It's kind of fun to think about it.

229
00:14:58,821 --> 00:15:03,200
We came out of the cave and we're going
back into the caves and Mars. But the, uh,

230
00:15:03,201 --> 00:15:07,820
the idea here is that you're much more
protected in these caves from ultra

231
00:15:07,821 --> 00:15:10,460
violets and, uh, and uh,

232
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,110
my guess is mission control would have
a hard time letting people go and caves.

233
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,830
But we'll see. Um, they're
definitely there on Mars.

234
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:24,710
So how are we going to use them? Uh, a
big issue is mobility on Mars. I mean,

235
00:15:24,711 --> 00:15:28,220
once you've got your
explorations zone started,

236
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,780
what kind of equipment are really going
to have to use to move around and get to

237
00:15:32,781 --> 00:15:37,040
places on Mars? And how much time
are they going to have outside? Uh,

238
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:41,880
how far should they go away from
the habitat in case the, the, uh,

239
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:45,860
rover kind of breaks down and the people
got to trudge back to the habitat for

240
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,210
safety.
Uh,

241
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,950
these are all early things that the Apollo
program ran into as well because they

242
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:56,951
didn't let the astronauts drive off
into the sunset and then have a,

243
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:01,010
a wheel fall off and tried to
get back to the lunar module.

244
00:16:01,011 --> 00:16:05,000
So there's some operational problems
here about mobility on Mars.

245
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:09,600
One way around that is having, uh,

246
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:13,340
the astronauts have the ability
to actually launch balloons.

247
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:14,440
Okay.

248
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,780
Make use of little robot hoppers.

249
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:21,580
There's this design of a Mars airplane,

250
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:26,581
kind of a remote pilot vehicle from
ours and all controlled by the people on

251
00:16:26,681 --> 00:16:31,681
Mars so they can extend
that zone a of exploration.

252
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:32,320
So I,

253
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,640
that's the other shoe that's going to
dropping now is how are we going to get

254
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:42,240
the blending of humans and the robotic
tools they need to really do an

255
00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:44,640
investigative,
uh,

256
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:50,610
multi expeditionary look at
Mars tumbleweed using the
winds of Mars instrumented

257
00:16:53,501 --> 00:16:57,010
tumbleweeds science payloads.

258
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,850
Some of these could be
unleashed across the polar caps.

259
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:03,940
Okay.

260
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,691
But then,
okay,

261
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:09,691
we get past the kind of
cool technical thing.

262
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:10,980
You start talking to someone,

263
00:17:10,981 --> 00:17:15,981
a psychologist and some of the people
who have done reports on submarines and

264
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:22,320
Antarctic and in any of the polar bases
and you start seeing some trouble signs

265
00:17:23,351 --> 00:17:27,520
here. Um, here's a trouble sign.

266
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:35,680
These guys went on strike in Skylab.
Uh, there was a moment there.

267
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:39,700
They had so much coming in from mission
control. They said, we're outta here.

268
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:45,190
We're cutting off calm. We're
going to enjoy this. You
got that. You got too much,

269
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:49,090
uh, operational paperwork.
We got to go through.

270
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:54,530
And they s there was an actual strike by
astronauts on board the sky lab so they

271
00:17:55,021 --> 00:17:56,640
had some time to fool around.

272
00:17:59,260 --> 00:17:59,450
Okay.

273
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,400
Uh,
the thing that's happening now is the,

274
00:18:01,401 --> 00:18:04,910
certainly the international space station
and the key thing, it's international,

275
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,193
you know,
multiple,

276
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,730
multiple countries have participated
in this huge engineering feat. Um,

277
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,560
early on we all thought, well, you know,

278
00:18:12,561 --> 00:18:16,820
is this the white elephant and space I
was, I'm probably guilty like everybody,

279
00:18:16,821 --> 00:18:19,900
why, how much money is this
thing going to cost? Uh,

280
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:22,520
it's turning out to be what promise to be,

281
00:18:22,521 --> 00:18:24,920
which is a test bed for a lot of hardware,

282
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,570
a lot of ideas and also understand
the physiological, sociological,

283
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:33,350
cultural impacts that
happen in micro gravity.

284
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:37,640
And it is becoming a testbed
for moving on to Mars.

285
00:18:37,641 --> 00:18:39,530
We're getting a lot of interesting,

286
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,440
provocative signals out of
the space station program.

287
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:49,060
Just a kind of a beauty shot
of the earth and the person.

288
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:50,880
Okay.

289
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,240
They have, I keep talking to
the astronauts. This is the,

290
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:58,400
this is a calm moment because a lot of
I'm trying to cram in there and it's hard

291
00:18:58,401 --> 00:19:01,100
to see out the window when he
got six or seven heads in there

292
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:06,580
haircuts in space.
That's a big issue.

293
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:09,953
Yeah.

294
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:13,870
Again, what are we learning
about, you know, life far away,

295
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:16,030
even though it's only 300 miles up.

296
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,453
Yeah.

297
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,600
Music is a big thing.
That's another big issue of trying to be

298
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:29,780
responsive to your own timeframe
and you can have fun. Uh,

299
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,790
I've seen some pretty interesting sports
that have shown up with m and m's again

300
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,120
and,
and they,

301
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,610
they take duct tape and make balls out
of him and try to lob it between the

302
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,780
modules and see who hits a target.
So I think just again,

303
00:19:44,781 --> 00:19:48,350
it's going to be an early
signature of what Mars exploration.

304
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:53,090
We'll be alive with people having to have
downtime and not be so under pressure.

305
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:54,920
Okay.

306
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:58,280
A very interesting experiment. Just a, um,

307
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:02,690
a while back with mark and Scott
Kelly. There were twins. Um,

308
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,930
here's,
he,

309
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,600
he stayed up on the space station for
a year and his brother went through all

310
00:20:08,601 --> 00:20:12,560
these medical tasks and as a control,
a person for a,

311
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:17,410
for a whole new look at what happens
to genetics and space. And, uh,

312
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:22,790
uh, he came up with all kinds of
interesting comments about his,

313
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:27,560
his trip. And, uh, I, I, NASA
hasn't even put it all together yet,

314
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:29,630
but there's definitely a, some, again,

315
00:20:29,631 --> 00:20:33,080
a lot of really positive things
and some things we got to watch.

316
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:38,720
But that was a year long
mission, uh, by Scott Kelly and,

317
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,240
uh,
came back on a saw,

318
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:44,090
use a capsule and landed in Russia.
And,

319
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:48,660
uh, obviously the biggest
question mark and, uh,

320
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,690
in exploration of Mars is,
you know,

321
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:57,700
whereas the life is that
there and if it's there,

322
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:02,730
should we be worried about us
contaminating it or it contaminate us?

323
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:08,320
We don't know. And, uh, we see things,

324
00:21:08,321 --> 00:21:09,670
evidence of surface water.

325
00:21:09,671 --> 00:21:13,600
These are probably the worst
kind of name you could ever give.

326
00:21:13,601 --> 00:21:18,260
Something that's kind of exciting. These
are called recurring slope linear. Yay.

327
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:23,200
This is, I go to conferences
and I the recurring slope, NEA,

328
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:27,070
that paper we found new ones.

329
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:34,450
Okay. Um, there's something
happening, seeping of water.

330
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:38,710
There was some speculation that some of
these things are fed by huge aquifers

331
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:43,600
underneath the surface. My guess
is that's probably true. Um,

332
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:47,170
and where there's water is their life.

333
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:50,710
So Mars still is hauntingly

334
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:52,460
okay.

335
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:56,420
Touching her nerves about
finding life on Mars.

336
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,970
And is it a second genesis of life?
Is it,

337
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:05,110
is it life that somehow came from
earth and landed on Mars or vice versa?

338
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,680
One of the things that people talk
about and I wrote about in the book is,

339
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,830
is it possible that Mars,
uh,

340
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:17,600
had microbial life really early in the
formation of the planets and it was

341
00:22:17,601 --> 00:22:21,710
impacted in microbial life
on Mars came to Earth.

342
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:27,220
So we are the marshes and the irony is
that we're going to go back the home

343
00:22:27,591 --> 00:22:28,424
planet.

344
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,183
Okay.

345
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:35,400
Um,
the life question is one that is a,

346
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:39,850
also an ethical ones and I've spent
a lot of time and energy on that.

347
00:22:39,851 --> 00:22:44,230
And one of the chapters
about terraforming Mars,

348
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,440
can we make an earth to,
you know,

349
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:52,030
are there ways that we can transform
Mars and make it more suitable to you?

350
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:55,000
Human kind. Uh, Tara farming,

351
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:59,500
we do it all the time here in the book.
We talk about global climate change.

352
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:04,360
That's terraforming. We just don't
have the levers right to control it.

353
00:23:04,361 --> 00:23:08,380
And we are trying to make certain rules
and regulations to control climate

354
00:23:08,381 --> 00:23:12,520
change. But can you bring that
to that planet and alter it,

355
00:23:12,521 --> 00:23:16,110
particularly when our life force
has been on that planet and as,

356
00:23:16,111 --> 00:23:21,040
as hunkered down there and then what
happens, uh, to the life on that planet.

357
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:21,730
So we,

358
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:26,730
what is the ethical boundaries
of exploration and using
Mars to kind of do the

359
00:23:27,161 --> 00:23:28,090
Mars makeover.

360
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,550
Okay.

361
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:34,770
The best thing is going on
for people in the morning.

362
00:23:34,771 --> 00:23:38,960
You get up for a rye imagery coming from
Mars is actual pictures from curiosity.

363
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:43,040
Landed on Mars in August of 2012.
Uh,

364
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:47,360
it's a one ton nuclear powered rover,
still cranking.

365
00:23:47,361 --> 00:23:51,980
Does great work.
Very slow from August,

366
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,800
2012 to just a few days ago.

367
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:57,170
It has driven I nine miles,

368
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:00,590
nine miles.
Okay.

369
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:04,160
You get some geologists down there and
they're going to kick that thing out of

370
00:24:04,161 --> 00:24:06,930
the way and keep going, you know, so, um,

371
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:12,770
it's a slow process, but you got to
multibillion dollar kind of investment.

372
00:24:12,771 --> 00:24:15,310
You gotta be careful about how you run it.
And it's,

373
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:19,530
it's really a very fascinating
piece of hardware. A,

374
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:22,970
these are the kinds of real,
this is real imagery from curiosity rover.

375
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,010
This is the kind of things that sees.

376
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,720
And every morning I get up and look at
the next set of raw imagery and it's

377
00:24:29,721 --> 00:24:31,220
pretty,
it really is cool.

378
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:46,210
How many people think you've been there?
I mean, is it, is, does it look familiar?

379
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:51,430
Am I wrong? I had been somewhere
like that and I've seen that,

380
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:53,680
okay,

381
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,700
this is a danger.

382
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:59,560
This is one of those I could
see me walking by and that
thing falling in on me.

383
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,630
Um, so that's, and that is
one of the points of the book.

384
00:25:04,631 --> 00:25:07,930
There's some danger here. This is not
going to be a slam dunk kind of mission.

385
00:25:07,931 --> 00:25:11,860
And, um, so we've gotta be very
careful how we pulled this off

386
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,110
the giant leap. Um, one
of the things, again,

387
00:25:17,111 --> 00:25:18,790
I'm trying to pull together,

388
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:24,100
when you go back and look at
exploration on the earth, we've really,

389
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,670
you can go anywhere. You can go into the
top of mountains, you can go under sea,

390
00:25:27,671 --> 00:25:32,030
you can go to deserts, you
can go to Arctic regions. Um,

391
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,850
you can do all that.

392
00:25:33,851 --> 00:25:38,851
And one of the things that always happen
as a humans create the technology that

393
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:44,260
the suits, the whatever, you know, to
conquer whatever environment they're in.

394
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:49,270
And it's the same way with Mars. We got
new kinds of suits people are looking at.

395
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,171
Uh,

396
00:25:50,171 --> 00:25:55,171
the key with this issue is
a mobility on the planet.

397
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,590
These people can't just, you know,
kind of, um, just walk around,

398
00:26:00,591 --> 00:26:02,900
they're going to have to do a lot of
work and if something breaks down,

399
00:26:02,901 --> 00:26:03,711
they're going to have to repair.

400
00:26:03,711 --> 00:26:08,450
So there all kinds of new mobility
devices on suits to give them more

401
00:26:08,451 --> 00:26:11,440
flexibility.
Um,

402
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,900
this is the biggest element.

403
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:16,290
Okay.

404
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:18,210
I don't know where all
this is going to go.

405
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:20,820
I all I know is that
people are working very,

406
00:26:20,821 --> 00:26:23,400
very hard about getting people to Mars.

407
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:28,260
And it's not just the U S
it's multiple countries. Uh,

408
00:26:28,261 --> 00:26:32,550
the political will and leadership of
any nation that undertakes this kind of

409
00:26:32,551 --> 00:26:35,340
event. Uh, even if it's a global event,

410
00:26:35,341 --> 00:26:39,120
there has to be some kind of leadership
role to sort of coordinate everything.

411
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:44,370
A bomb has been interesting. He's made
some talks just about going to Mars.

412
00:26:44,371 --> 00:26:49,230
We're going, uh, then we
have an administration change
and I, I'm getting old,

413
00:26:49,231 --> 00:26:53,790
but I lived in Washington DC for 30 years
and every time one of these people get

414
00:26:53,791 --> 00:26:58,270
in, they look at NASA and I shift
things around and try to, it's just,

415
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,040
it's another issue they got to
deal with the last go around.

416
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:05,880
They totally trashed the, uh, one, uh,

417
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:10,940
really a synergistic and exploration
driven space program and put in the,

418
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,190
the shuttle got shutdown and,
and money got moved to this or that.

419
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:21,740
So it's hard to keep this momentum going.
Uh,

420
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:26,190
so this is going to be very, this is a key
thing. Where's that going to come from?

421
00:27:26,191 --> 00:27:30,720
What countries you actually
going to take that role? Uh,

422
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,290
I call it,
uh,

423
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,330
I'm trying this on you because
I can't figure out what it is.

424
00:27:36,331 --> 00:27:39,240
But at the end of the book,
when I got done, I got,

425
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:44,670
I pushed the send button on the last
chapter and I kept thinking, you know,

426
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:51,410
back in the old exploration days and
exploration of the oceans in particular,

427
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,880
it's, it's a ship going
off the edge of the earth.

428
00:27:56,881 --> 00:28:01,881
They were worried the sea
serpents whirlpools scurvy.

429
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:04,531
I mean,

430
00:28:04,531 --> 00:28:09,531
they went through all these things and
I think we're sort of doing the same

431
00:28:09,691 --> 00:28:12,210
thing to ourselves.
Cosmic Rays,

432
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:15,570
Michael gravity radiation.

433
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:17,270
Okay.

434
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:21,320
There's less gravity on Mars. What
does it do to you? Psychology?

435
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:26,060
I think micro gravity, maybe the
scurvy up today for space travelers.

436
00:28:26,061 --> 00:28:30,230
It's the kind of thing we'll defeat
somehow. There'll be some new ideas.

437
00:28:30,231 --> 00:28:35,210
They'll be new ways to do that. And for
the first time, everybody in this room,

438
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:40,940
uh, w you know, the people going to
Mars are going to be interactive.

439
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:44,430
I mean, this is going to be, we're
all going to go. Uh, I don't, I,

440
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,860
I'm sure there'll be something
else other than Gopro, but did it,

441
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:52,870
will be on their helmets and will
virtually be there with them for the first

442
00:28:52,881 --> 00:28:56,350
time in exploration history.
Will,

443
00:28:56,351 --> 00:29:01,351
we're all going to be able to partake
in this kind of unique travel to another

444
00:29:01,791 --> 00:29:04,550
world.
And I call it now history.

445
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:09,470
It's something totally now never
been done before. And in fact,

446
00:29:09,471 --> 00:29:10,630
I hate to bother you guys up,

447
00:29:10,631 --> 00:29:14,780
but I couldn't have written this book
without Google. It just, you know,

448
00:29:14,781 --> 00:29:19,190
for a research person and trying to
understand all the different parameters of

449
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,100
exploration of Mars, uh, the Internet, uh,

450
00:29:22,101 --> 00:29:24,800
how powerful it is and you can
see where it's going to go.

451
00:29:24,801 --> 00:29:29,120
You guys are leading the charge
on Google earth, Google, Mars. Um,

452
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:33,290
it's definitely going to be interactive
exploration like nothing we've ever had

453
00:29:33,291 --> 00:29:37,970
before.
So,

454
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:38,983
Mars,

455
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:44,350
we need you and I hope you'll contribute
to the figuring out how best to solve

456
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:50,840
some of these tough problems
I've kind of outlined here. Um,

457
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:57,220
there's the book, I hope you get the
book, I think. How many seconds do I go?

458
00:29:57,221 --> 00:30:00,430
I gotta go, I gotta do this.
I got something declassified.

459
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:06,220
How many here have a security
clearance? Okay, well nevermind. Uh,

460
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:12,810
this is Leonard David in
the kind of late in the 60s.

461
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:17,920
I went to Mars with my
project epic experimental,

462
00:30:17,921 --> 00:30:22,630
prolonged isolation jammer. I and my
mom called it the die a death trap.

463
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:28,060
So here I am in my Mars Habitat.

464
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:34,540
I built this out of plywood and some
of the most advanced technologies I had

465
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:37,450
available to me at the home depot.

466
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:43,390
We had reversed vacuum
cleaners to exchange the air.

467
00:30:43,391 --> 00:30:47,460
We had a life support equipment,
uh,

468
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:52,200
you know, toilets. We had
it all in there. And uh,

469
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,940
there's some elaborate
a circuitry that was a,

470
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:03,280
I borrow from the ninth grade
and then electronic class 10 can,

471
00:31:03,281 --> 00:31:07,900
I don't even know what that
was. Uh, this was, you know,

472
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:10,390
recycling.
Here's my friend.

473
00:31:10,391 --> 00:31:15,391
Jerry was about as crazy as I was
and so I stayed in it for 12 hours.

474
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:19,570
Jerry stayed in there for 24.
He would, he broke the record.

475
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:25,270
This is me inside this thing.
I had my little control panel

476
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:31,600
cleverly. You have a note thing. So
I can take notes. It's cold in here.

477
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,600
Most of us were sent to NASA by the way,

478
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:38,380
and I take that picked up in
a couple of points. Again,

479
00:31:38,381 --> 00:31:39,640
some of the advanced circuitry

480
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:44,560
that you learned or you
can take notes and dark.

481
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:50,080
We had an air lock so we can pass food.

482
00:31:50,081 --> 00:31:53,320
It would have had that tech a lot of time.
Didn't make sure that this is light,

483
00:31:53,321 --> 00:31:57,970
no light getting in. No
light. That was hard. Anyway,

484
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,540
that was my trip back in the late sixties.

485
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:05,560
I appreciate your time
here and uh, I hope, uh,

486
00:32:05,561 --> 00:32:09,070
we have little time for
questions and again,

487
00:32:09,071 --> 00:32:10,900
thank you for sharing
your lunch hour with me.

488
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,800
Anything, Eh, I guess you're supposed to
use a microphone if that's the procedure.

489
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:29,890
Um, so you talked about the telepresence
mission with humans in Mars' orbit,

490
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:34,370
controlling robots below to,
uh, assemble the habitats. Um,

491
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:37,930
as you probably know,
the uh,

492
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:42,320
mission design that I find very intriguing
anyway is send humans to Mars but

493
00:32:42,321 --> 00:32:44,720
never land them.
You send humans to Mars,

494
00:32:44,721 --> 00:32:49,640
but they stay in orbit or maybe on
Phobos or Damos our tele or our tele.

495
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:53,120
Tell operating robots on the planet
below so you get rid of the light time

496
00:32:53,121 --> 00:32:56,180
delays that you have with current
robotic exploration. Right. Um,

497
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:59,300
but you never have to fight more as
gravity. Well, Dave, opinions about that

498
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:02,500
mission design, you know, I, it's,

499
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:07,510
I'm just excited we can debate
it, you know. Oh, should
we go down to the surface?

500
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:11,970
There's no our bet. Okay, that's
great. Let's just get there now.

501
00:33:11,971 --> 00:33:12,671
We'll figure it out.

502
00:33:12,671 --> 00:33:17,050
But I do think the tele robotics is
going to play a role no matter what.

503
00:33:17,051 --> 00:33:18,460
If you've got humans on Mars,

504
00:33:18,461 --> 00:33:20,530
they're going to be doing a
lot of tele robotic things.

505
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:24,250
The idea about the teller robotics,
the first guy that I,

506
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:27,880
Fred singer actually had a,
what he called the Phd Program,

507
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:32,050
which is Phobos and Deimos program.
He made that point. He said,

508
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:35,080
this life on Mars,
is that an issue?

509
00:33:35,081 --> 00:33:39,580
And maybe we should just have sterilized
robots running around down there. Um,

510
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,410
I don't know which way
it's going to go in.

511
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:46,360
My guess is it's going to be shoot the
Indians and ask questions later. You know,

512
00:33:46,361 --> 00:33:49,060
I'm afraid of that.
Uh,

513
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,680
Robert Zubrin or the Mars society is
very big on, don't worry about it.

514
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:57,250
And I think there's enough people in
planetary protection and is saying,

515
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,250
let's worry about it now. And we, in fact,

516
00:34:00,251 --> 00:34:04,330
we probably have already fouled up
and asked a little bit here and there.

517
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,240
So it's a good point.
I don't know which way it's going to go,

518
00:34:07,241 --> 00:34:11,590
but I hope that discussion happens and
that we were just arguing between, oh,

519
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:15,640
well, you know, let's stay in orbit
or go down. Let's get to that point.

520
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,161
My question is,
uh,

521
00:34:19,161 --> 00:34:23,230
what do you see as Google's
role or potential role in
the colonization of Mars?

522
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:27,060
Well, I, that's why I said
I, I do think you have, uh,

523
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:31,630
a seminal role here. And really, I
mean it's, I think the whole team,

524
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,920
I know you guys are what,
20,

525
00:34:32,921 --> 00:34:36,850
I don't know how many offices
are all over the place, but yeah,

526
00:34:36,851 --> 00:34:40,600
how do we increase the public
participation, citizen science? I mean,

527
00:34:40,601 --> 00:34:45,160
people want to be involved and
I think the more we can do,

528
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:49,000
everybody can take ownership in this.

529
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:51,280
Everybody can be a
pioneer at the same time.

530
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:55,380
Never been done before on that
scale of exploration and I,

531
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:58,660
so whatever,
you know,

532
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,990
feedback loops or whatever
it's going to be in the future.

533
00:35:01,991 --> 00:35:06,760
I just see this as an opportunity for
everybody and the more people realize that

534
00:35:06,761 --> 00:35:11,680
they are actually going to learn by being
involved in this and letting people do

535
00:35:11,681 --> 00:35:15,940
whatever they're going to do on the
surface. And you know, again, I,

536
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,920
it'd be beyond Gopro cameras,

537
00:35:17,921 --> 00:35:22,300
but there's a cool thing coming up on
the Mars 2020 rover from Nasa for the

538
00:35:22,301 --> 00:35:26,050
first time. They have hearing devices
on there. We'll actually hear Mars.

539
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:31,500
So synthesizing the feel of
Mars and hearing what's on Mars.

540
00:35:31,661 --> 00:35:36,460
I'm not sure if we're going to hear
barking dogs. Maybe you never know. Uh,

541
00:35:36,461 --> 00:35:41,461
but the of wins of Mars and that being
another human capability on that planet I

542
00:35:42,271 --> 00:35:43,830
think is that to me is exciting.

543
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:51,080
I was wondering if you could comment a
little bit on some of the timelines and I

544
00:35:51,081 --> 00:35:55,610
dunno if you want to say anything about
the plan I read about recently for

545
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:57,290
100,000 colonists.

546
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:02,220
Yeah, that's Alon. Alon Musk is a
driven, driven the dream machine.

547
00:36:02,221 --> 00:36:03,054
You know,
he's,

548
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:07,680
he's got a pretty interesting concept and,
you know,

549
00:36:07,681 --> 00:36:10,320
he's the guy that's put his
money where his mouth is. I mean,

550
00:36:10,321 --> 00:36:14,760
he's building rockets, he's
exploding rockets. He's learning. Uh,

551
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,910
we've got a ways to go for, I see
you didn't have planetary transports,

552
00:36:17,911 --> 00:36:22,680
but I mean he's got the master plan Kinda
from ours in his mind of how it could,

553
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:27,480
could work. Um, you know,

554
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:32,380
I think what I liked about his
talk and Mexico was that he,

555
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:36,540
he, he made it sound like this is
happening. This is where we're, I'm going,

556
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,790
come along, you know. And so I
think that's all helpful. Uh,

557
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,300
every engineer I talked to after
his talk you to have more detail,

558
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:47,610
we're going to have a lot
more detail on that one.

559
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:53,870
So I think alliance got his work cut
out for him to actually explain some of

560
00:36:54,721 --> 00:36:56,560
the, a, in fact there's some, uh,

561
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:00,390
some early essays that are being written
now about and criticizing some of its

562
00:37:00,391 --> 00:37:04,530
parts of his mission. But
anyway, it's fine. To me, it's,

563
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,540
that's part of the deal.
That lawn,

564
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:11,110
he's got to make rockets go up and
come down. He's got that down. He's,

565
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:14,890
you have this explosion with
a space x rocket the other,

566
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:17,730
a couple months ago or
whatever it was. So, you know,

567
00:37:17,731 --> 00:37:21,780
he's not out of the woods about success.
So we'll see. I think it's great.

568
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,590
That's about all I can say about it.
Let's make it happen. Anything else there?

569
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,010
Um, I want to ask, um,

570
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:35,880
I know it was that Mohs or it's kind of
like [inaudible] and other people are

571
00:37:35,881 --> 00:37:39,180
thinking about colonize
a moon and a Venice.

572
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:44,530
Others fear 50 miles can
system the human balloon.

573
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:49,000
Compare all of this, uh, a cons
plying which fine, you've seen cases

574
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:53,180
or at least take or cost benefit.
Yeah. Here's the problem.

575
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:58,780
This is why I'm old and crotchety now
because I signed up for looking at space

576
00:38:00,591 --> 00:38:03,230
and reporting about space long time ago,

577
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:07,190
and the visionaries at the time,
you know, we're blowing up rockets,

578
00:38:07,191 --> 00:38:11,720
but next to you on overhead
dogs barking in space, uh,

579
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:16,640
and the timelines that were
suggested, go to the moon, go to Mars.

580
00:38:16,641 --> 00:38:20,180
We're going to Alpha Centauri
interstellar flight. And I go, okay,

581
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:24,050
that sounds good. Sounds like a
checklist thing. Let's do all those.

582
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,940
So I'm,
I'm,

583
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:31,030
I'm advocating having a strong space
program that has all those elements in it.

584
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:36,210
I this idea that somehow we get to Mars
and it's all over is not part of my

585
00:38:36,551 --> 00:38:38,140
dream.
Um,

586
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:41,590
I've written about interstellar travel
and there's lots of things you can see

587
00:38:41,591 --> 00:38:44,580
coming in the physics journals.
We're going to be,

588
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:48,160
the solar system's going to shrink where
there's the speed levels were going at

589
00:38:48,161 --> 00:38:51,400
an hour.
Not going to be the way we're doing this.

590
00:38:51,401 --> 00:38:55,000
I flew out here from New
York last night and I, I,

591
00:38:55,001 --> 00:38:57,350
if I was in a Conestoga wagon,
I'd still becoming,

592
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:02,140
let's say I'm not going to make it. Um,
so transportation is going to change.

593
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,430
We're going to get around the solar
system much faster. So going to the moon,

594
00:39:06,431 --> 00:39:09,660
going to El Point's going to Mars.
I,

595
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:12,070
that should be some
kind of integrated plan.

596
00:39:12,071 --> 00:39:15,100
If one country wants to pull
the lunar village together,

597
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:19,870
NASA is very keen on not
spending money on the moon again,

598
00:39:19,871 --> 00:39:24,100
but going to a Mars, even buzz when
I worked on the book with Buzz,

599
00:39:24,101 --> 00:39:27,100
I mean he doesn't want us tax
dollars going back to the moon.

600
00:39:27,101 --> 00:39:31,810
He wants to spend the money on
Mars. But we'll see. I, like I said,

601
00:39:31,811 --> 00:39:36,811
there's this European view of setting up
a lunar village that you could take the

602
00:39:37,301 --> 00:39:39,910
resources there on the moon and make fuel,

603
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:44,170
send them up to a position in space and
that's the fuel you might want to use

604
00:39:44,171 --> 00:39:48,630
for your Mars transport
system. So, you know,

605
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,510
whatever happens.

606
00:39:49,511 --> 00:39:54,310
It's cool as long as we don't discontinue
everything because other countries are

607
00:39:54,311 --> 00:39:57,890
moving out. I think it's clear to
me if he, if he have leadership,

608
00:39:57,891 --> 00:40:02,220
you had political, do you have
a technological drive? Uh,

609
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:07,480
in a country? I think the space program,
uh, makes that happen. They can,

610
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:08,770
it can do those kinds of things.

611
00:40:08,771 --> 00:40:11,500
It'd be a lot of spin offs
and those kinds of things.

612
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:14,530
I'm not a big spinoff person.
I glad it happens,

613
00:40:14,531 --> 00:40:18,810
but I'm into into it for the
exploration of it. I just think that's,

614
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:23,500
this is what humans do.
And Meyers is a metaphor for exploration.

615
00:40:23,501 --> 00:40:28,501
It's a metaphor for scientific discovery
and also danger that that was a great

616
00:40:29,951 --> 00:40:34,330
elements for a drama.
Anything else?

617
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,493
Second question.

618
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:42,660
So what is it about Mars that excites
more interest in exploration than say,

619
00:40:43,951 --> 00:40:48,790
Venus? Yeah, I like Venus
too. It's hot. So hot.

620
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:53,770
Uh, there's a lot of talk about life's
in the clouds of Venus. I Dunno,

621
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:57,940
there's some new books come in and
will be very interesting. Uh, again,

622
00:40:57,941 --> 00:41:01,630
I don't really, I try not to, you know,

623
00:41:01,631 --> 00:41:03,820
in my lifetime I lost a planet.

624
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:10,750
Pluto got demoted. I mean, I, as a kid,

625
00:41:10,751 --> 00:41:15,751
I had to learn all those plants and then
you get one tossed off and I then I,

626
00:41:15,851 --> 00:41:18,850
then all of a sudden we have
exoplanets discovered everywhere.

627
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:23,320
I've gained several thousand or a
thousand, whatever the number is today.

628
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:27,910
Maybe they'd discovered something
last night. Um, I'm sorry,

629
00:41:27,911 --> 00:41:32,170
what was the question?
Venus and Mars,

630
00:41:32,171 --> 00:41:34,730
I don't know Venus going to be there.

631
00:41:34,731 --> 00:41:36,710
There are some new spacecraft
they're going to go to.

632
00:41:36,711 --> 00:41:41,120
Venus will understand it more
the greenhouse effect on Venus.

633
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,950
Is it something, a precursor to the
way the earth is going to go under you?

634
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:49,700
You hear all that, you know the classic
line hint. It's so hot. It melts lad.

635
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:54,560
Okay, well prove it. I
don't know. Um, I, uh,

636
00:41:54,561 --> 00:41:59,090
I, I think Venus is, is
interesting in its own right.

637
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:02,990
They're all interesting. I mean, there's
a lot of people want to go to Europa.

638
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:06,890
We have a mission that's
being prescriptive for your
rope and landing on an icy

639
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:07,341
moon.

640
00:42:07,341 --> 00:42:11,900
And that these moons are turning out to
be interesting because of the potential

641
00:42:11,901 --> 00:42:15,530
for oceans underneath the
ice. What's, you know,

642
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:20,590
you've got people look trying to put
a little detectors for whale sounds or

643
00:42:21,291 --> 00:42:23,660
something. I don't know what they're
going to be looking for. Anyway.

644
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:27,800
I think all those are a player because
we're starting to learn about our own

645
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:33,070
backyard and this transportation thing
of moving around much faster and,

646
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:37,940
uh, is going to happen. So I think
everything's going to be accessible.

647
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:41,160
We can do a lot more.
And the biggest thing is coming in here,

648
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:43,490
a planetary exploration is a cube sats.

649
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:48,860
You're going to start seeing these
things as a small sats. I mean,

650
00:42:48,861 --> 00:42:52,910
I go do articles about people that worked.
I've worked on the Galileo program.

651
00:42:52,911 --> 00:42:56,750
It took me 15 years of my
life, you know, and, and uh,

652
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:01,190
now you can put these things
in a lab and a couple months,

653
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:05,600
test them out. You get them on a
rocket. They're going to be some cubes.

654
00:43:05,601 --> 00:43:08,960
Ads launched a lob to the
moon here in a few years.

655
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,010
So interplanetary and small sats
are kind of coming together.

656
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,330
So things like Venus and
launching little balloons,

657
00:43:17,331 --> 00:43:20,660
they can travel around Venus.
I'm up for it all.

658
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:24,500
They're all, all, all planners are good.

659
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:25,893
Okay.

660
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:31,910
Anything else? Okay. I
really appreciate your time.

661
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,610
It's been
okay.

662
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:39,680
Oh, can you? Okay. Yep.

663
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:45,590
I'd be remiss because the book is to
companion piece to the trailer on a starch

664
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,860
to November 14th at.

665
00:43:46,861 --> 00:43:50,460
This gives you an idea of where
they're going in a docker drama. Yeah.

666
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:56,510
Place where you feel safest place,
where you belong.

667
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:00,530
Six months ago we left that place.

668
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:04,400
We shut the confirm our warms
the planet across the void,

669
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:11,980
even though we might not do it, is
our mission to make this place home.

670
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:19,010
Mars a global event series coming this
fall to the national geographic channel.

671
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:26,470
I didn't give you much. There
is a surprise ending. Let me,

672
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:30,730
let me finish with one thing that I,
I long time ago I met Ray,

673
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:35,550
anybody or Ray Bradbury Fan,
ray Bradbury,

674
00:44:35,551 --> 00:44:36,480
I just,

675
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:40,320
I was putting a conference together at
jet propulsion lab and Ray Bradbury was

676
00:44:40,321 --> 00:44:44,340
the speaker and I got a chance
to talk to him and I said,

677
00:44:44,341 --> 00:44:48,720
I really admire your writing and
you know, how, how do you do it all?

678
00:44:48,721 --> 00:44:52,380
And he's like, he looked for the
metaphor, look for the letter for

679
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:55,620
it.
Took me a while to figure that out.

680
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:00,660
But I am I a the I but I ended
the book with Ray Bradbury. Uh,

681
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,480
he in 1976,

682
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:08,160
Bradbury rejoiced in the touchdowns of
the Viking one and two robot robotic

683
00:45:08,161 --> 00:45:12,990
landers on Mars sang today
we have touched Mars,

684
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:18,020
there is life on Mars and it is us
extensions of our eyes in all directions.

685
00:45:19,411 --> 00:45:23,310
Extensions of our mind,
extensions of our heart and soul.

686
00:45:23,311 --> 00:45:27,030
I've touched Mars today.
That's the message she'll look for there.

687
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:30,820
We are on Mars.
We are the Martians,

688
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:34,110
so thanks again.
Appreciate it.

689
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:37,670
[inaudible].
